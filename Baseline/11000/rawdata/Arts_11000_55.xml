'''Allan Bernard Temko''' (February 4, 1924 – January 25, 2006) was an architectural critic and writer based in San Francisco.

== History ==
Born in New York City and raised in [[Weehawken]], New Jersey, Temko served as a [[U.S. Navy]] officer in World War II, graduated from [[Columbia University]] in 1947, and continued his graduate studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris, France. He taught for several years in France and produced a landmark book about the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]], ''Notre Dame of Paris,'' in 1955.&lt;ref name=SFC-obit /&gt; He wrote architectural criticism for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' from 1961 to 1993.  He also taught [[city planning]] and the social sciences at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[California State University, Hayward]] (now California State University, East Bay).

Following Finnish-born architect [[Eero Saarinen]]'s death in 1961, Temko published ''[[Eero Saarinen]]'' (1962), a critical examination of Saarinen's most famous works from the [[General Motors Technical Center]] to the [[Jefferson National Expansion Memorial]] and its [[Gateway Arch]] (still in the planning stages at the time), as a volume in [[George Braziller]]'s ''Makers of Contemporary Architecture'' series.

Temko was an activist critic who defended the urban character and texture of San Francisco from, in his words, "a variety of villains: real estate sharks, the construction industry and its unions, venal politicians, bureaucrats, brutal highway engineers, the automobile lobby, and – in some ways worst of all – incompetent architects and invertebrate planners who were wrecking the Bay Area before our eyes."  One of these villains, an architect named [[Sandy Walker]], famously sued Temko over his 1978 description of Walker's [[Pier 39]] project which began, "Corn. Kitsch. Schlock. Honky-tonk. Dreck. Schmaltz. Merde."&lt;ref name=SFC-obit /&gt;

Temko was instrumental in the removal of the [[Embarcadero Freeway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iK4cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e3oEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3258%2C1195153 |title=Chinatown Demands Highway Repair |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=AP |date={{date|1990-04-17|dmy}} |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |accessdate={{date|2015-02-06|dmy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and memorably described the 1971 [[Vaillancourt Fountain]] on the Embarcadero as a thing "deposited by a concrete dog with square intestines."&lt;ref name=SFC-obit /&gt;

He described the [[City Center Building]] in [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] in the early 1970s, calling it a "toaster", due to its slightly elongated rectangular shape, which strongly influenced public opinion of the building.

Temko, who met [[Jack Kerouac]] when they were both undergraduates at Columbia, appears in Kerouac's novel ''[[On the Road]]'' as the model for the character "Roland Major".&lt;ref name=SFC-obit /&gt;  Temko also appeared in Kerouac's ''[[Book of Dreams (novel)|Book of Dreams]]'' as Irving Minko and in ''[[Visions of Cody]]'' as Allen Minko.

He called for an international design competition for the [[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|eastern span replacement]] of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]], saying that both the single-tower cable-stayed scheme (favored by [[T.Y. Lin]]) and the single-masted self-anchored suspension design ultimately chosen were incapable of being "a world-famous work of engineering art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/COMMENTARY-Hold-On-We-Can-Do-Better-by-the-3002571.php |title=COMMENTARY: Hold On — We Can Do Better by the Bridge |author=Temko, Allan |date={{date|1998-06-23|dmy}} |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate={{date|2015-02-06|dmy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temko was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Criticism]] in 1990. He died of apparent congestive heart failure at the Orinda Convalescent Hospital in [[Orinda, California]], in 2006.&lt;ref name=SFC-obit&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Allan-Temko-architecture-watchdog-2542550.php |title=Allan Temko - architecture watchdog |author1=Taylor, Michael |author2=King, John |date={{date|2006-01-26|dmy}} |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate={{date|2015-02-06|dmy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Amalia''''' is a 19th-century political novel written by the exiled Argentine author [[José Marmol]]. First published serially in the Montevideo weekly, ''Amalia'' (1851) became Argentina's national novel.{{Citation needed|date = June 2016}} Along with [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]'s [[Facundo]], ''Amalia'' can be seen as an early precursor to the [[Latin American]] [[dictator novel]] through its strong criticism of caudillo [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], who ruled Argentina with a strong fist from 1829 to 1852.

Set in post-colonial Buenos Aires, ''Amalia'' was written in two parts and is a semi-autobiographical account of José Mármol that deals with living in Rosas's police state. Mármol's novel was important as it showed how the human consciousness, much like a city or even a country, could become a terrifying prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=109,151}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amalia'' also attempted to examine the problem of dictatorships as being one of structure, and therefore the problem of the state "manifested through the will of some monstrous personage violating the ordinary individual's privacy, both of home and of consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1989|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnór had strong anti-Communist views and was said to have been "extremely critical of the Icelandic Socialists" in his 1999/2000 book ''Moskvulínan: Kommúnistaflokkur Íslands og Komintern, Halldór Laxness og Sovétríkin''.&lt;ref name="Olesen2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Olesen|first=Thorsten B.|title=The Cold War and the Nordic countries: historiography at a crossroads|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pClnAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=16 July 2012|year=2004|publisher=University Press of Southern Denmark|isbn=978-87-7838-857-5|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the son of [[Hannibal Valdimarsson]], a former minister, and had several sons and one daughter, [[Thora Arnorsdottir]].

[[File:Part of the collection at the Phuthadikabo Museum, Botswana.jpg|thumb|Part of the collection at the Phuthadikabo Museum, Botswana]]
The visual '''art of Botswana''' has varied among different ethnic group and throughout history. Historically it has fallen into two main categories: that of the [[!Kung]] peoples (also known as the [[San people]] or the [[Bushmen]] tribes) and that of the [[Nguni people|Nguni]]-derived peoples such as the [[Batswana]].

== !Kung Art ==
The first is of greater antiquity in origin, and includes decoration of many of the devices and equipment the [[ǃKung people|!Kung]] needed for desert existence. Items such as [[ostrich]] shells, clay water filters, animal skins, arrows, bows and pots often received added decoration by way of incised or relief decoration, imprinted pottery decoration, beading and carving. These tribes also carved art objects that had no other function, most often of animals.

A more ancient art is that of [[San rock art]], for which the !Kung are justifiably famous: right across the South-East African region their ancestors left dynamic paintings on rock faces and cave walls, executed in unknown and highly resilient pigments that have lasted millennia. Depictions of animals, hunts, ceremonies and dances are common. The [[Tsodilo]] Hills in Botswana were recognised as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2001, containing some 4,500 rock paintings in total; not all the art covered by this designation is by San people or their ancestors.  Most paintings may be from the last 1000 or 2000 years, although much older dates are sometimes claimed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanrockart.org/rock-art-gallery/botswana/ "Rock Art of Botswana"], Trust for African Rock Art&lt;/ref&gt;  It is difficult to date most paintings; often [[radiocarbon dating]] methods can be used for materials on the floor of a shelter, but these may not relate to the dates of the art.&lt;ref&gt;Willett, 56-58&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nguni Art ==
The Nguni peoples' art is more similar to Nguni-derived peoples' art in the rest of South-Eastern Africa. Sophisticated [[carvings]] of stone and wood (usually of animals or people), sculptures and pottery; 'township' art made of disca instruments, carved walking sticks, knobkerries and many other art forms. One art that is particularly developed in Botswana is the preparation and marketing of hides and furs that have been stitched together, often combined in decorative panels using the different fur types and colours from different animals. These can have a definite use as well, being derived originally from the '[[kaross]]' or desert blanket suited to the very cold conditions of the Kalahari at night and in winter. Woollen and crocheted blankets in local patterns are also popular. [[Basket weaving]] is also carried out to a high level of skill and variation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botswana.co.za/Cultural_Issues-travel/botswana-country-guide-art-for-all.html Culture and Traditions of Botswana | Arts and Crafts], botswana.co.za&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a great deal of overlap between the two groups' artwork: for example the wire, ironwork and beads used in !Kung items would have been obtained by trade from Nguni peoples, who themselves would have obtained some of their raw art material such as skins and animal horns from the !Kung.

== Modern Art ==
[[File:Three Dikgosi Monument - March 2010.jpg|thumb|The ''Three Dikgosi Monument'' in [[Gaborone]].]]
These days the art industry thrives in the production of items for tourist consumption. The Okavango swamp, some parts of the Kalahari desert tourist trail and various game reserves all support active local art industries. The major towns also have tourist galleries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botswana.co.za/Cultural_Issues-travel/botswana-country-guide-art-for-all.html Culture and Traditions of Botswana | Arts and Crafts], botswana.co.za&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists, including white Botswana residents, paint two dimensional pictures of wildlife for the same market, which also includes various items such as T-shirts, hunting knives, shoes and hats. Leather-work is also popular, as are items made from legally cullerded or utilitarian urban objects such as bottle tops and wire; drums, beading, rattles, musical instruments such as the [[mbira]] and stringed animals such as elephant hair bracelets.

During [[Apartheid]], South African artists in exile gathered in Botswana under the name Medu Art Ensemble to produce political artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Medu Art Ensemble, Gaborone, Botswana.

[[Image:Intaglio-rollers.JPG|thumb|A variety of contemporary rollers ("brayers").]]
{{Wiktionary}}
A '''brayer''' is a hand-tool used historically in [[printing]] and [[printmaking]] to break up and "rub out" (spread) ink before it was "beaten" using [[Ink ball|inking balls]] or [[composition roller]]s. The word is derived from the verb to "bray", meaning "to break, pound, or grind small, as in a mortar".&lt;ref&gt;''The Chambers dictionary'' (Edinburgh: Chambers, 1993), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; A brayer consists of a short wooden cylinder with a handle fitted to one end; the other, flat end is used to rub the ink.&lt;ref&gt;William Savage, ''Dictionary of the art of printing'' (London: Longman etc., 1841), p. 91,&lt;/ref&gt; In the late nineteenth century the term was applied in the United States to a small hand-roller, "used for spreading ink on the inking table, and for applying it to the distributing plates or rollers connected with presses".&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Ringwalt, ''American encyclopaedia of printing'' (Philadelphia: Menamin &amp; Ringwalt, 1871), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Such small rollers were sold as "brayers" from at least 1912&lt;ref&gt;The American Type Founders specimen of this year lists both hand-rollers (large) and brayers (small).&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the century the term was applied in the U.S. to hand-rollers of all sorts and sizes. It retains its original meaning in Europe.

==Materials==
Brayers in the original sense were generally made of wood (though Southward refers to theirs being made of "wood or glass").&lt;ref&gt;John Southward, ''Practical printing'' (4th edition by Arthur Powell. London: "Printer's Register" Office, 1892), page 370.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, rollers could be made of [[Composition roller|composition]], [[Vulcanization|vulcanized rubber]], [[sponge]], [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]], [[polyurethane]] or [[leather]]. They are formed around a shaft or core and often attached to a wooden handle. Some rollers have an all-metal support, while larger examples may have two handles to allow for two-handed use (to allow the heavy roller to be controlled and in some cases to apply additional pressure).

==Process==
The printer uses an [[Spatula (disambiguation)|ink knife]] to lay out a "pad", mound or streak of ink on a smooth inking plate, originally made of polished metal or stone. The ink is then rubbed with the brayer until an area is smooth enough to beat with the ink balls or roller. In contemporary printmaking commercially available inks are often smooth and soft enough that they do not require braying before they can be rolled (and thus a more-fragile glass sheet may be used as an inking plate). The roller is passed systematically across the surface to produce an even layer of ink. The roller is then applied to the [[Forme (printing)|forme]], [[Relief printing|block]], [[Lithography|stone]] or [[Intaglio (printmaking)|plate]] so that the ink is evenly transferred to the raised or receptive areas before the next stage of transferring the ink, by moderate pressure, to the printing surface or [[Offset printing|offset]] substrate.

==Uses==
Brayers are rarely used in contemporary printing and printmaking to break up and spread ink, except in cases of historical reconstruction or when a printer has made his own ink and it is too thick to spread without the use of a brayer. Rollers are primarily used for [[relief printing]], leather rollers almost exclusively in [[lithography]] and sponge rollers are used only for [[paint]], [[scrapbooking]] and other craft applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8033">[[File:Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg|thumbnail|Christ Pantocrator from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Sinai]].]]
'''The Christ Pantocrator of St. Catherine’s Monastery at Sinai''' is one of the oldest [[Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] religious [[icon]]s, dating from the sixth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;John Galey, George Forsyth, and Kurt Weitzmann, ''Sinai and the Monastery of St. Catherine'' (Givatayim, Israel: Massada, 1980), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the earliest known version of the [[Christ Pantocrator|pantocrator style]] that still survives today, and is regarded by historians and scholars to be one of the most important and recognizable works in the study of [[Byzantine art]] as well as [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

For a time the icon was thought to have been dated from the thirteenth century, since it had been almost completely painted over at that time, but it was concluded in 1962 that it is in fact from the mid-sixth century, although the exact date of production is still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weitzmann, ''The Monastery of Saint Catherine at Mount Sinai, the Icons'' (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1976), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Saint Catherine's Monastery|Saint Catherine’s Monastery]] was founded by the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]], late in his reign, between 548 and 565,&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt; it enjoyed imperial patronage and donations from Justinian and his court, with the Christ Pantocrator icon having been one of the many possible imperial gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92; Kōnstantinos A. Manaphēs, ''Sinai: Treasures of the Monastery of Saint Catherine'' (Athens: Ekdotike Athenon, 1990), 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, it is generally believed to have been produced in the Byzantine capital of [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, Sinai, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation and meaning ==
{{see also|Christ Pantocrator}}

[[File:Composite_christ_pantocrator.png|thumb|Mirrored composites of left and right sides of image]]

Many agree that the icon represents the [[Hypostatic union|dual nature of Christ]], illustrating traits of both man and god,&lt;ref&gt;Manolis Chatzidakis and Gerry Walters, “An Encaustic Icon of Christ at Sinai,” ''The Art Bulletin'' 49, No. 3 (1967): 201; Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92; Manaphēs 93; Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps influenced by the aftermath of the [[ecumenical council|ecumenical councils]] of the previous century at [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] and [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Manaphēs, ''Sinai: Treasures'', 84; Robin Cormack, ''Oxford History of Art: Byzantine Art'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Christ’s features on the left side{{clarify |date=March 2018 |reason=Is that *his* left side, or the left side of the painting?}} are supposed to represent the qualities of his human nature, while the right side represents his divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His right hand is shown opening outward, signifying his gift of blessing, while the left hand and arm is clutching a thick [[Gospel]] book.&lt;ref&gt;Chatzidakis and Walters, “An Encaustic Icon,” 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested the icon at Sinai could have been a possible representation of the Kamouliana icon of Christ&lt;ref&gt;Cormack, ''Byzantine Art'', 78-9; Manaphēs, ''Sinai: Treasures'', 93.&lt;/ref&gt; or of the famous icon of Christ of the [[Chalke Gate]],&lt;ref&gt;Chatzidakis and Walters, “An Encaustic Icon,” 202.&lt;/ref&gt; an image which was destroyed twice during the first and second waves of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]]{{mdash}}first in 726, and again in 814{{mdash}}and thus its connection with the Christ Pantocrator is difficult to confirm.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description and production ==

With a height of 84&amp;nbsp;cm, width of 45.5&amp;nbsp;cm, and a thickness of 1.2&amp;nbsp;cm, the icon was originally taller and wider before its top and sides were cut.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise there is only one spot with major damage, a large portion of Christ’s hair on his left side, including his left ear and shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] surface has continually been preserved in excellent condition overall.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt; As with many of the early icons from Sinai, the Christ Pantocrator was created by using this technique, known as encaustic—a medium using hot wax paint—that would rarely continue to be utilized in the Byzantine world after the iconoclastic controversies of the eighth and ninth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Cormack, ''Byzantine Art'', 111-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the monastery at Sinai is the only place in the world where a substantial number of these encaustic icons, particularly those dating from as early as the sixth century, have been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Period of Byzantine [[Iconoclasm]], the production of Orthodox icons continued at Sinai, whereas they were being destroyed in Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Survival from Byzantine Iconoclasm and aftermath ==
The Muslim Arabs [[Early Muslim conquests|quickly took control]] of the entire [[Fertile Crescent]] south of the Turkish mountains, including Egypt and Sinai, cutting the monastery’s ties with Constantinople in the year 640.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, by the time the era of iconoclasm had been initiated by [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] in 726, the Monastery of Saint Catherine had already been protected under [[caliphate|Muslim rule]] for nearly a century and was able to survive the destruction of iconoclasm.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weitzmann, “The Mosaic in St. Catherine’s Monastery on Mount Sinai,” ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 110, No. 6 (Dec. 1966): 405; Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92; Manaphēs, ''Sinai: Treasures'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the location of the monastery in the rocky desert of Sinai, far away from any major trade or military route, kept the contents within St. Catherine’s safe from raiders as well as conquering armies.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, “Mosaic in St. Catherine’s,” 392; Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Even today the monastery houses more than 2,000 icons, dating from the sixth century to the modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''coat of arms of Moldova''' consists of a [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] holding a cross in its beak and a sceptre and an [[olive branch]] in its claws. According to [[Gheorghe Vrabie]], the author of the coat of arms, the eagle symbolizes the [[Ancient Rome|Latin]] origin of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{mo icon}}[http://www.moldova.md/md/simbol/2465/ Interview with plastic artist Gheorghe Vrabie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428001857/http://www.moldova.md/md/simbol/2465/ |date=2008-04-28 }} at the official website of the Republic of Moldova&lt;/ref&gt;

The chest of the eagle is protected by a shield that bears the traditional arms of [[Moldavia]]: an [[aurochs]]' head with a star between its horns. It also contains two lozenges (the ears), a five-petaled flower and a moon in a crescent phase. Everything on the shield has one of the three traditional colours: red, yellow, blue.

The coat of arms appears in the centre of the [[flag of Moldova]].

The '''coat of arms of the [[Azores]]''' is nine gold stars superimposed on a red bordure, representing the nine islands of the archipelago. The bordure surrounds a silver shield on which a blue eagle is displayed with wings elevated and with red feet, beak, and tongue. The crest is a closed helm in gold lined with red, surmounted by a wreath and mantling of silver and blue, topped by another blue eagle on which are superimposed the same nine gold stars.  

The shield is supported by two chained black bulls, above a scroll containing the motto ''Antes morrer livres que em paz sujeitos'' ({{lang-en|Rather die free than in peace be subjugated}}). The supporters each hold a flagpole. Their collars, chains, and hooves are gold, their horns silver. The flags bear Christian symbols. The flag dexter, that is, on the viewer's left, is the red cross of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Portuguese Order of Christ]] on a white field. The flag sinister, that is, on the viewer's right, is a white dove superimposed on gold rays in the shape of a cross - the emblem of the [[Holy Spirit]] - on a red field, both flags bordered in gold.

Early Portuguese visitors mistook the local variety of [[buzzard]], ''[[Common Buzzard|Buteo buteo rothschildi]]'', for [[Northern Goshawk|goshawk]]s (''Accipiter gentilis'') and the [[Portuguese (language)|Portuguese]] word for "goshawk", ''açor'' (pl. ''açores''), is the root of the islands' name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotw.us/Flags/pt-a.html#flag Azores], September 1999, Flags of the World website. Accessed May 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Goshawks also remain a common motif in Azorean [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]].

'''Nontraditional casting''', '''integrated casting''', or sometimes '''color-blind/gender-blind casting''' is the practice of [[casting (performing arts)|casting]] without considering the actor's [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[Human skin color|skin color]] and/or [[gender]]. A representative of the [[Actors' Equity Association]] has disputed the use of the term "color blind", preferring the definition "nontraditional casting". Nontraditional casting "is defined as the casting of ethnic minority actors in roles where race or ethnicity is not germane".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

"'''Don't be evil'''" is a [[motto]] used within [[Google]]'s corporate code of conduct.

Following Google's corporate restructuring under the conglomerate [[Alphabet Inc.]] in October 2015, Alphabet took "Do the right thing" as its motto, also forming the opening of its corporate code of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/10/02/alphabet-do-the-right-thing/ |title=Alphabet replaces Google's 'Don't be evil' with 'Do the right thing |last=Lawler |first=Richard |date=2 October 2015 |publisher=[[AOL]] |work=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Why Google Was Smart To Drop Its 'Don’t Be Evil' Motto |author=David Mayer |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3056389/why-google-was-smart-to-drop-its-dont-be-evil-motto |magazine=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |date=2 September 2016 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=New Google Parent Company Drops 'Don't be Evil' Motto |author=Tanya Basu |url=http://time.com/4060575/alphabet-google-dont-be-evil/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=4 October 2015 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://investor.google.com/corporate/code-of-conduct.html |title=Code of Conduct |publisher=Google|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004012914/https://investor.google.com/corporate/code-of-conduct.html|archive-date=4 October 2015 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://abc.xyz/investor/other/code-of-conduct.html |title=Alphabet Code of Conduct |date=2 October 2015 |publisher=Alphabet |accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original motto was retained in Google's code of conduct, now a subsidiary of Alphabet. In April 2018, the motto was removed from the code of conduct's preface and retained in its last sentence.&lt;ref name=SEJ&gt;{{cite journal |last=Montti |first=Roger |url=https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-dont-be-evil/254019/ |title=Google's "Don't Be Evil" No Longer Prefaces Code of Conduct |journal=Search Engine Journal |date=20 May 2018 |accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The motto was first suggested either by Google employee [[Paul Buchheit]] at a meeting about corporate values that took place in early 2000&lt;ref name="blogoscoped"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-07-16-n55.html |title=Paul Buchheit on Gmail, AdSense and More |publisher=[[Blogoscoped]] |date=25 January 2007 |accessdate=4 April 2013}} (quoting from: [[Jessica Livingston]], ''[[Founders at Work]]'', {{ISBN|978-1590597149}})&lt;/ref&gt; or in 2001&lt;ref name="gleick2011" /&gt; or, according to another account, by Google Engineer Amit Patel in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |location=AU |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/dont-be-evil/2008/04/15/1208025168177.html?page=3 |title=Don't Be Evil or don't lose value? |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buchheit, the creator of [[Gmail]], said he "wanted something that, once you put it in there, would be hard to take out", adding that the slogan was "also a bit of a jab at a lot of the other companies, especially our competitors, who at the time, in our opinion, were kind of exploiting the users to some extent".&lt;ref name="blogoscoped" /&gt; 

While the official corporate philosophy of Google&lt;ref name="GooglePhil"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ten things we know to be true |url=https://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/ |website=Google Company |publisher=Google |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; does not contain the words "Don't be evil", they were included in the [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] (on [[Form S-1]]) of Google's 2004 [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] (a letter from Google's founders, later called the "'Don't Be Evil' manifesto"): "Don't be evil.  We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served—as shareholders and in all other ways—by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/06/23/what-would-2004-google-say-about-antitrust-probe/ |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Shira |last=Ovide |title=What Would 2004 Google Say About Antitrust Probe? |date=23 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bz8paR7v?url=https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/06/23/what-would-2004-google-say-about-antitrust-probe/ |archivedate=2 October 2015 |accessdate=2 October 2015 |deadurl=no |quote="Our goal is to develop services that significantly improve the lives of as many people as possible.

This is an important aspect of our culture and is broadly shared within the company..." |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motto is sometimes incorrectly stated as ''Do no evil''.&lt;ref name="gleick2011"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/aug/18/how-google-dominates-us/?pagination=false |title=How Google Dominates Us |first=James |last=Gleick |authorlink=James Gleick |publisher=[[The New York Review of Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://gawker.com/valleywag/tech/google/dont-be-evil-factcheck-the-company-motto-153908.php |contribution=Don’t be evil. Fact-check the company motto |title=[[Valleywag]] |publisher=[[Gawker]] |author=ndouglas |date=9 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2018, the motto was still cited in the preface to Google's Code of Conduct:

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; 
"Don't be evil." Googlers generally apply those words to how we serve our users. But "Don't be evil" is much more than that...

The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put "Don't be evil" into practice...&lt;ref name=SEJ/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Between 21 April and 4 May 2018, Google removed the motto from the preface, leaving a mention in the final line: "And remember… don't be evil, and if you see something that you think isn't right – speak up!"&lt;ref name=SEJ/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gizmodo 18 May 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Conger |first1=Kate |title=Google Removes 'Don't Be Evil' Clause From Its Code of Conduct |url=https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393 |accessdate=19 May 2018 |work=Gizmodo |date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==
In their 2004 founders' letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504142742/ds1a.htm#toc59330_1 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] |location=USA |title=Letter from the founders, "an owner's manual" for Google's shareholders |date=14 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to their [[initial public offering]], [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] argued that their "Don't be evil" culture prohibited [[conflicts of interest]], and required [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]] and an absence of [[bias]]:

{{quotation|Google users trust our systems to help them with important decisions: medical, financial and many others. Our search results are the best we know how to produce. They are unbiased and objective, and we do not accept payment for them or for inclusion or more frequent updating.  We also display advertising, which we work hard to make relevant, and we label it clearly. This is similar to a well-run newspaper, where the advertisements are clear and the articles are not influenced by the advertisers’ payments. We believe it is important for everyone to have access to the best information and research, not only to the information people pay for you to see.}}

[[Chris Hoofnagle]], director of [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]], [[Berkeley Law]]'s [[information privacy]] programs, has stated that Google's original intention expressed by the "don't be evil" motto is linked to the company's separation of search results from advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume=14 |number=4–6 |date=April 2009 |journal=First Monday |first=Chris |last=Hoofnagle |url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2326/2156 |title=Beyond Google and evil: How policy makers, journalist and consumers should talk differently about Google and privacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he argues that clearly separating search results from sponsored links is required by law, thus, Google's practice is now mainstream and no longer remarkable or good.  Hoofnagle argued in 2009 that Google should abandon the motto because:

{{quotation|The evil talk is not only an [[Albatross (metaphor)|albatross]] for Google, it obscures the substantial consumer benefits from Google’s advertising model. Because we have forgotten the original context of Google’s evil representations, the company should remind the public of the company’s contribution to a revolution in search advertising, and highlight some overlooked benefits of their model.}}In a 2013 [[NPR]] interview, [[Eric Schmidt]] revealed that when Larry Page and Sergey Brin recommended the motto as a guiding principle for Google, he "thought this was the stupidest rule ever", but then changed his opinion after a meeting where an engineer successfully referred to the motto when expressing concerns about a planned advertising product, which was eventually cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytech.com/Googles+Eric+Schmidt+Dont+Be+Evil+was+Stupid/article31544.htm |publisher=[[DailyTech|DailyTech LLC]] |location=USA |title=Google's Eric Schmidt: "Don't Be Evil" was Stupid |date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists have raised questions about the actual definition of what Google considered "evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qz.com/284548/what-google-really-means-by-dont-be-evil/ |publisher=[[Atlantic Media|Quartz]] |location=USA |title=What Google really means by "Don’t be evil" |date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/what-is-evil-to-google/280573/ |publisher=[[The Atlantic Monthly Group]] |location=USA |title=What Is 'Evil' to Google? |date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the user-facing 'What We Believe' page, Google appeared to replace the original motto altogether (a carefully reworded version stood as of 10 April 2015, "''You can'' make money without doing evil",&lt;ref name="GooglePhil" /&gt; which varied significantly from the absolute [[Imperative mood|imperative]] of ''DON'T be'' evil).

==Use in criticism of Google==

[[Criticism of Google|Critics of Google]] frequently spin the motto in a negative way, such as [[InfoWorld|InfoWorld's]] 2014 article ''"Google? Evil? You have no idea"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2610434/cringely/google--evil--you-have-no-idea.html |title=Google? Evil?

On 16 May 2013, [[Margaret Hodge MP]], the chair of the [[United Kingdom]] [[Public Accounts Committee]] accused Google of being "calculated and unethical" over [[tax avoidance by Google|its use of highly contrived and artificial distinctions]] to avoid paying billions of pounds in [[Corporation tax]] owed by its UK operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/16/google-told-by-mp-you-do-do-evil |title=MP on Google tax avoidance scheme: 'I think that you do evil' |author=Simon Bowers |work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was accused by the committee, which represents the interests of all UK taxpayers, of being "evil" for not paying its "fair amount of tax". She told [[Matt Brittin]], head of Google UK, "I think that you do evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22554548 |title=Margaret Hodge labels Google tax record 'evil' |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the UK Government introduced a new law intended to penalise Google and other large [[multinational corporation|multinational]] corporations' artificial tax avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31942639 |title=Budget 2015: 'Google Tax' introduction confirmed |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Effect of Snow on Petit-Montrouge''''' (French: '''''Effet de neige à Petit-Montrouge''''') is an 1870 [[landscape painting]] by the French painter [[Édouard Manet]]. 

==History==

The oil on canvas painting shows a winter view of [[Petit-Montrouge]], an area in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris]]. Manet painted this picture while a member of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] during the 1870–71 [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. As opposed to the [[History painting|history painters]] of his time, Manet does not show a heroic view of battle, but rather the dusky ambiance of a looming battle. The image reflects Manet's loss of hope about the military situation, his profound loneliness, and the deprivation he suffered during this time. It is one of the few landscapes in Manet's oeuvre, and is one of Manet's first ''[[plein air]]'' paintings. Today it is in the collection of the [[National Museum Cardiff]]. 

==Composition==

Manet uses earthly and muted tones to illustrate an urban snow landscape; between the large peaks of white and diagonals of murky brown the Paris district of Petit-Montrouge is illustrate, overshadowed by the brown dirty snow and bleak beige sky. The buildings in the background were painted with muted colours to give an appearance of balancing precariously on a huge expanse of brown.

'''''Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad''''' is a book written by [[William Craig (author)|William Craig]] and published in 1973 by [[Reader's Digest Press]] and in 1974 by [[Penguin Publishing]]. The 2001 film ''[[Enemy at the Gates]]'' utilized the book's title and used it as one of its sources, but was not a direct adaptation of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epilog.de/Film/Dr_Dz/Texte/Duell_Enemy_at_the_Gates_USA_D_2001_Interview.htm| website=Epilog.de| title=Interview with Jean-Jacques Annaud, referenced by Constantin Film| language=German| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818113711/http://www.epilog.de/Film/Dr_Dz/Texte/Duell_Enemy_at_the_Gates_USA_D_2001_Interview.htm| archivedate=2007-08-18| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-03-16/features/0103160144_1_vassili-zaitsev-danilov-jude-law|title=`Enemy at the Gates' is right on target|website=Baltimore Sun|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The ''[[Slavic Review]]'' panned ''Enemy at the Gates'', calling it "rambling and exaggerated" and negatively comparing Craig to author [[Paul Carell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parrish|first=Michael|date=1974-01-01|title=Review of Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad|jstor=2495819|journal=Slavic Review|volume=33|issue=2|pages=363–364|doi=10.2307/2495819}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was more favorable and drew favorable comparisons to [[Cornelius Ryan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ambrose|first1=Stephen E.|title=So much for so little|work=The Washington Post|date=04/08/1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges''' ('''''Exhibition of Flemish Primitives at Bruges''''') was an art exhibition of paintings by the so-called [[Flemish Primitives]] (nowadays usually called Early Netherlandish painters) held in the [[Provinciaal Hof]] in Bruges between 15 June and 5 October 1902.

It was the largest exhibition of c 15th c Flemish art to date, consisted of 413 official catalogue entries,&lt;ref name=Bohn&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohn|first=Babette|title=A companion to Renaissance and Baroque Art|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Son|isbn=9781118391501|page=513|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjE8vLREjmYC&amp;pg=PA521 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and drew some 35,000 visitors.&lt;ref name=Krul/&gt; The exposition was highly influential, leading to at least five contemporary books as well as numerous scholarly articles, and initiated deeper study of the Flemish Primitives by a new generation of [[connoisseur]]s.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;&lt;ref name=VKC&gt;{{cite web|last=Paumen|first=Vanessa|title=De Vlaamse primitieven: What's in a name?|url=http://vlaamseprimitieven.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/nl/onderzoek/webpublicaties/de-vlaamse-primitieven-whats-in-a-name|publisher=De Vlaamse Kunstcollectie.be|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also inspired [[Johan Huizinga]] to research and write his ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stigter|first=Bianca|title=De ontsproten Picasso|year=2009|publisher=Atlas Contact|isbn=9789025430412|language=Dutch|chapter=Voor eksters geschilderd. Jan van Eyck in Brugge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in attribution of many important works (in table below) reflects progress in understanding the era by art historians since then, although it is an ongoing process.

==Exposition==
The 1902 exhibition was not the first to focus on the Flemish Primitives, although it was the first on this scale and to generate so much interest and scientific feedback. Among earlier exhibitions were the 1867 "Tableaux de l'ancienne école Néerlandaise" in Bruges, also directed by W. H. J. Weale; the 1892 "Exhibition of pictures by masters of the Netherlandish and allied schools of XV and early XVI centuries" at the [[Burlington Fine Arts Club]], with 60 pictures;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition culture in London 1878–1908|url=http://www.exhibitionculture.arts.gla.ac.uk/exhibition.php?eid=2980|publisher=Exhibition Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1899 ''Netherlandish School'' exhibition at the [[New Gallery (London)]], with 165 works.

The 1902 exposition was originally intended for Brussels, but moved to Bruges after the city refused to lend the many works it held to the exhibition if it did not take place in Bruges. It was held in the Provincial Government Palace in Bruges from 15 June until 15 September 1902, but due to popular demand was extended until 5 October 1902.

The president of the exhibition was Baron [[Henri Kervyn de Lettenhove]].

[[William Henry James Weale]] wrote the notes for the catalogue for the painting section. The often erroneous attributions were those of the owners, but the position of the paintings in the exhibition generally reflected the opinion of the organizers, including Weale and Georges Hulin de Loo (a professor at the [[University of Ghent]]), regarding their authorship.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt; The illustrated catalogue of the section showing manuscripts, [[Illuminated manuscript|miniatures]], archive texts, seals, [[Méreau (token)|mereaux]], coins and medals was written by Baron [[Albert Van Zuylen Van Nyevelt]]. A third section, covering needlework, gobelins, and the like, was catalogued by [[Isabelle Errera]].

The exhibition showed some 400 paintings attributed to the Flemish Primitives, many of which had never before been exhibited. The display of many works by major artists created the first strong opportunity to compare their styles side by side and revise earlier attributions, either from one painter to another or from "work by" to "copy of a work by".

The exhibition was opened by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]], and visited by Crown Prince [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert]] and Crown Princess Elisabeth on 3 July 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prinselijk bezoek voor de Tentoonstelling der Vlaamse Primitieven.|url=http://beeldbankbrugge.be/beeldbank/weergave/record/?id=2a5077f7-8920-4216-b08a-acd0630135d2|publisher=Beeldbank Brugge|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The exhibition showed far more of the most important remaining examples of Early Netherlandish panel painting than earlier exhibitions and sparked a lively discussion about the attributions of the paintings, started by Hulin de Loo: dissatisfied with the official catalogue, he published his own critical catalogue.&lt;ref name=Ridderbos&gt;{{cite book|last=Ridderbos|first=Bernhard|title=Early Netherlandish Paintings: Rediscovery, Reception, and Research|year=2005|publisher=Getty|isbn=9780892368167|page=481|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1Kmpi4bOygC&amp;pg=PA453 |chapter=3. From Waagen to Friedländer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition greatly improved the appreciation of Early Netherlandish art, which previously had been chiefly appreciated only by a few collectors and art historians,
&lt;ref name=Krul&gt;{{cite book|last=Krul|first=Wessel|title=Early Netherlandish Paintings: Rediscovery, Reception, and Research|year=2005|publisher=Getty|isbn=9780892368167|page=481|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1Kmpi4bOygC&amp;pg=PA453 |chapter=4. Realism, Renaissance and Nationalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also led to shifts in the status of the artists: [[Hans Memling]], who had been considered to be the major artist of the period, was surpassed by the likes of [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. This has been attributed to the abundance of works by Memling at the exhibition, which made critics notice the lack of invention and overly serialized production he often showed, compared to the other masters.&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Jenny|title=Inventing Van Eyck: The Remaking of an Artist for the Modern Age|year=2007|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781845207762|page=259|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N378atgUje0C&amp;pg=PA232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the organizers of the exhibition had a somewhat Belgian nationalistic view, art lovers in other countries sometimes reacted vehemently to the appropriation of "their" painters by the Flemish or Belgians. In France, there were calls for a similar exhibition of French Primitives, which was organised in 1904 and tried to reclaim artists, like van der Weyden and [[Robert Campin]], who were from French-speaking parts of the Netherlands; it also tried to cast Early Netherlandish painting as a derivative of Early French painting.&lt;ref name=Krul/&gt;

The Bruges exhibition directly influenced some painters, who incorporated aspects of Flemish Primitive painting into their work. Flemish [[Expressionism|expressionist]] [[Gustave Van de Woestijne]] changed his approach to portraiture, focusing more on the psychological aspects, while his colleague [[Valerius de Saedeleer]] was influenced by the landscapes he saw at the exhibition.&lt;ref name=Boyens&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyens|first=Piet|title=Sint-Martens-Latem|year=1998|publisher=Lannoo|isbn=9789020934977|page=517|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEPOYiZilNEC&amp;pg=PA52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a new exhibition documenting the 1902 exhibition and its impact was held in Bruges: "Impact 1902 Revisited. Early Flemish and Ancient Art exhibition. Bruges 15th June - 15th September 1902, Brugge, 2002.", with a catalogue by Eva Tahon, Piet Boyens e.a.&lt;ref name=VKC/&gt;

[[File:Remarque Im Westen nichts Neues 1929.jpg|thumb|Remarque's ''All Quiet on the Western Front'']]

[[World War I]] was never quite so fertile a topic as [[World War II]] for American fiction, but there were nevertheless a large number of fictional works created about it in Europe, Canada, and Australia. Many [[war novel]]s, however, have fallen out of print since their original.  Numerous scholarly studies have covered the major fictional authors and writings.&lt;ref&gt;Holger Michael Klein, ''The First World War in fiction: A collection of critical essays'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Onions, and Paula Loscocco, ''English Fiction and Drama of the Great War, 1918–39'' (Springer, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Cruickshank, ''Variations on catastrophe: some French responses to the Great War'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Christine Puissant, ''Irony and the poetry of the First World War'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine O'Brien, ''Women's fictional responses to the First World War: a comparative study of selected texts by French and German writers'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erika Quinn, "Love and loss, marriage and mourning: World War One in German home front novels."

==Genres Influenced by World War I==
Several entire genres grew out of the disillusionment and disappointment of World War I.  The [[hardboiled|hard-boiled detective novels]] of the 1920s featured bitter veteran protagonists.  The [[Cthulhu Mythos|horror stories]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]  after the war showed a new sense of nihilism and despair in the face of an uncaring, chaotic cosmos, very unlike his more conventional horror before the war.

The picture measures 65.5 × 77.3 cm. and has the accession number 1795.
In the 19th century, the painting was also known  as ''Triumph of Homeopathy.''&lt;ref name="gtg_4_1"&gt;{{cite book| author =  | chapter = | chapter-url = | format = | url =  | title = Государственная Третьяковская галерея — каталог собрания | orig-year = | agency = {{nobr|Я.

==History==
The allegorical image&lt;ref name="gtg_4_1" /&gt; ''Homeopathy Looks at the Horrors of Allopathy'' was painted by Alexander Beideman in Munich in 1857.&lt;ref name="leonov"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Верещагина, Алла Глебовна |title=Александр Егорович Бейдеман |agency=А. И. Леонов |edition=Русское искусство: очерки о жизни и творчестве художников. Середина XIX века.  |location=Москва |date=1958 |publisher=Искусство |pages = 275—286}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Homeopathy|homeopath]] [[Габрилович, Николай Евгеньевич|Nicholas Gabrilovich]] (1865-1941), the painting was commissioned by his father, Eugene Gabrilovich (1835-1918), who at that time studied in Munich. The canvas was acquired by [[Pavel Tretyakov]] before 1893. In 1923, the picture was exhibited at the Tretyakov Gallery at an exhibition dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the death of Pavel Tretyakov.
There is also an unfinished variant of the painting, which until the early 1970s was in possession of the widow of Nicholas Gabrilovich, Larisa Maslova-Gabrilovich (1894-1985), and then was sold to a private collection in Kemerovo.
In November 2015, the Engineering Building of the State Tretyakov Gallery organized an exhibition of the painting in conjunction with the conference "Art in homeopathy and homeopathy in art".&lt;ref name="homeopath"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2017-02-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The "positive extreme of the scene" is located in the right part of the painting. In the background, an allegorical depiction of Homeopathy soars in the clouds. In front of her is the god of medicine [[Aesculapius]] in a red cloak, his left hand raised in anger and indignation. Behind him is the goddess [[Athena]], who protects the sciences. At the right edge of the canvas is the German physician [[Samuel Hahnemann]] (1755-1843), the founder of homeopathy. 
All of them look with disapproval and indignation at those associated with [[allopathy]] (modern medicine) in the "negative extreme," located on the left side of the painting, where doctors mistreat a patient. One doctor saws off the leg of a patient while the patient's wife and children sob in the lower left corner, the figure of Death waiting in the doorway.&lt;ref name="elshevskaya"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture reflects the status homeopathy had in the nineteenth century, when it claimed to be more scientific than the extremely dogmatic "[[heroic medicine]]" of the period, which frequently did more harm than good, whereas, in the words of [[Ben Goldacre]], homeopathy "at least did nothing either way."&lt;ref name="Goldacre: A kind of magic"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goldacre|first1=Ben |title=A kind of magic?|author-link=Ben Goldacre|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/nov/16/sciencenews.g2 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=June 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the painting depicts conventional medicine as rogues and charlatans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3118">[[File:Idital Wall Painting.jpg|thumb|400px|"''Idital''" -a form of Soura Wall Painting of Rayagada District]]
'''Idital''' is a form of [[Saura painting]](ikons) associated with the [[Sora people|Saura tribals]] in the [[Odisha|state of Odisha]] in [[India]] and mostly found in [[Rayagada district|Rayagada]], Gajapati and Koraput districts of Orissa. The tribal deity "IDITAL" (also ''edital'') commands great religious devotion from the tribal people. Each Idital contains various symbols and signs and convey special meaning for which it is meant. Few examples of iditals are (1) Jodisum and Jananglasum, 
  
==Origin and History==

Seven out of sixty two tribes of Orissa decorate their wall with mural paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vaishalisethi.com/aboutart.html "About Soura Art"]&lt;/ref&gt; Souras are specially famous for their rich veriety of paintings based on religious and ceremonial themes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/orissareview/jan2005/englishPdf/Souras_Paintings.pdf " The Souras &amp; their Panoramic Paintings"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orissatourism.org/orissa-paintings.html "Odisha (Orissa) Paintings"]&lt;/ref&gt; They have invariably religious association for which they are called italons or ikons. Ikons were originally painted on the walls of the Saura's adobe huts. Ikons are worshipped during special religious and cultural occasions such as child-birth, harvest, marriage and the construction of a new house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110119/jsp/orissa/story_13459472.jsp "Traditional drawings of Saoras is on verge of extinction"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.importantindia.com/1633/tribal-paintings-of-orissa "Tribal Paintings of Orissa"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scstrti.in/exhibition.html "Tribal Museum"]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is generally made to appease the Gods and ancestors.

==Theme, Color and Style==

These icon’s line drawings are based on geometrical forms. The forms are very easiest to draw and the composition of themes are very simple. People, [[horses]], [[elephants]], the [[sun]] and the [[moon]] and the [[tree of life]] are recurring [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] in these ikons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://orissatribalart.wordpress.com/2010/04/25/idital-tribe-soura "IDITAL TRIBE–SOURA"]&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings' backdrop is prepared from red or [[yellow ochre]] earth which is then painted over using brushes fashioned from tender [[Bamboo Shoots|bamboo shoots]]. Ikons use natural dyes and chromes derived from ground white stone, hued earth, and [[vermilion]] and mixtures of [[tamarind]] seed, flower and leaf extracts.&lt;ref name="deccanherald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Timeless images|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/191569/timeless-images.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=Deccan Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiantribalheritage.org/?p=3983 "Centre develops Saura tribal paintings of Raygada – Odisha"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tdccorissa.org/TO_Saora.asp "TRIBES ODISHA - SAORA IDTAL PAINTINGS"]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Industrial property''' is one of two subsets of [[intellectual property]] (the other being [[copyright]]) takes a range of forms, including [[patent]]s for [[invention]]s, [[industrial design]]s (aesthetic creations related to the appearance of industrial products), [[trademark]]s, [[service mark]]s, layout-designs of [[integrated circuit]]s, [[commercial name]]s and designations, [[geographical indication]]s and protection against [[unfair competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/36/intellectual-industrial-and-commercial-property|title=Intellectual, industrial and commercial property {{!}} Fact Sheets on the European Union {{!}} European Parliament|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, aspects of an intellectual creation, although present, are less clearly defined. The object of industrial property consists of signs conveying information, in particular to consumers, regarding products and services offered on the market. Protection is directed against unauthorized use of such signs that could mislead consumers, and against misleading practices in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_909_2016.pdf|title=Understanding Copyright and Related Rights|last=|first=|publisher=WIPO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-805-2799-5|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad application of the term “industrial property” is set out in the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention,]] Industrial property legislation is part of the wider body of law known as [[intellectual property]] (IP) which refers broadly to the creations of the human mind. IP rights protect the interests of innovators and creators by giving them rights over their creations. The [[Convention establishing the world intellectual property organization|Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization]] (1967) does not seek to define [[Intellectual Property Rights|intellectual property]], but lists the following as protected by IP [[Intellectual Property Rights|rights]]:[[Literature|literary]], [[art]]istic and [[scientific works]]; [[performance]]s of [[Performing arts|performing artists]], phonograms and broadcasts; inventions in all fields of human endeavor; scientific discoveries; industrial designs; trademarks, service marks, and commercial names and designations; protection against unfair competition; “''all other rights resulting from intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary or artistic fields''”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_895_2016.pdf|title=Understanding Industrial Property|last=|first=|publisher=WIPO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-805-2588-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries generally have laws to protect IP for two main reasons:
# To  give  statutory  expression  to  the rights  of  creators  and  innovators  in their  creations  and  innovations,  balanced  against  the  public  interest  in accessing creations and innovations;
# To  promote  creativity  and  innovation, so contributing to economic and social development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The importance of protecting Industrial property was first recognized in the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]] in 1883 and the [[Berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works|Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in 1886. Both treaties are administered by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Patents for Invention ==
{{Main|Patent}}
[[Patent]]s, also referred to as patents for invention, are the most widespread means of protecting technical inventions. The patent system is designed to contribute to the promotion of [[innovation]] and the transfer and dissemination of [[technology]], to the mutual advantage of inventors, users of inventions and the [[general public]]. Once a patent is granted by a state or by a regional office acting for several states, the owner of a patent has the right to prevent anyone else from commercially exploiting the invention for a limited period, generally 20 years. The patent applicant must disclose the invention in order to obtain protection, and their rights can be enforced only within the territory in which the patent was granted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Definitions ===
Most laws dealing with the protection of [[invention]]s do not actually define what an invention is. A number of countries, however, define inventions as new solutions to technical problems. The problem may be old or new, but the solution, in order to be considered an invention, must be a new one. Merely discovering something that already exists in [[nature]] will not generally qualify as an invention; an adequate amount of human [[ingenuity]], [[creativity]] and inventiveness must be involved. But an invention need not be technically complex: the [[safety pin]] was an invention that solved a “technical” problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Exclusive rights ===
By granting an exclusive right, patents provide incentives, offering inventors recognition for their creativity and material reward for their marketable inventions. These incentives encourage innovation, which in turn contributes to continued enhancement of the quality of life. In return for the exclusive right, the inventor must adequately disclose the patented invention to the public, so that others have access to the new knowledge, leading to further innovation. The disclosure of the invention is thus an essential consideration in any patent granting procedure. The word “patent”, or “letters patent”, also denotes the document issued by the relevant government authority. In order to obtain a patent for an invention, the inventor, or often the inventor’s employer, submits an application to the national or regional patent office concerned. In the application, the applicant must describe the invention in detail and compare it with previous existing technologies in the same field in order to demonstrate that it is new.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Patentability ===
Not all inventions are patentable. Patent laws generally require that an invention fulfill the following conditions, known as the requirements or conditions of patentability:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Patentable subject matter:''' The invention must fall within the scope of patentable subject matter as defined by national law. This varies from one country to another. Many countries exclude from patentability such subject matter as scientific theories, mathematical methods, plant or animal varieties, discoveries of natural substances, methods for medical treatment (as opposed to medical products), and any invention where prevention of commercial exploitation is necessary to protect public order, morality or public health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Industrial applicability (utility):''' The invention must be of practical use, or capable of some kind of industrial application.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Novelty:''' The invention must show some new characteristic that is not known in the body of existing knowledge (referred to as prior art) in its technical field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Inventive step (non-obviousness):''' The invention must show an inventive step that could not be deduced by a person with average knowledge of the technical field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Disclosure of the invention:''' The invention must be disclosed in a clear and complete manner in the patent application to be carried out by a person skilled in the art (a person conversant in the field of technology concerned).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The conditions of novelty and inventive step must be fulfilled by a certain date, generally the date on which the application is filed. An exception to this rule, covered by an applicant’s right of priority, is regulated by the Paris Convention. The right of priority means that, having filed an application in one member country of the Paris Convention, the same applicant (or their successor in title) may, within a specified time period, apply for protection for the same invention in any of the other member countries. These subsequent applications will not be invalidated by reason of any acts occurred between the filing date of the earliest application and the subsequent applications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For example, if an inventor first files an application for patent protection in Japan, and later a second application, with respect to the same invention, in France, it is sufficient that the conditions of novelty and non-obviousness existed at the date on which the Japanese application was filed. In other words, the later, French application retains priority over any applications relating to the same invention filed by other applicants between the date of the inventor’s first and second application. This is subject to the period between the two dates not exceeding 12 months.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Products and processes ===
It is customary to distinguish between inventions that consist of products and inventions that consist of processes. The creation of a new alloy is an example of a product invention. The invention of a new method or process of making a known or new alloy is a process invention. The corresponding patents are usually referred to respectively as a product patent and a process patent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Patentees ===
The person to whom a patent is granted is known as the patentee, the owner of the patent or the patent holder. Once a patent has been granted with respect to a particular country, anyone who wishes to exploit the invention commercially in that country must obtain the patentee’s authorization. In principle, anyone who exploits a patented invention without the patentee’s authorization commits an illegal act. Protection is granted for a limited period, generally 20 years. Once a patent expires, the protection ends, and the invention enters the public domain (also known as being “off patent”). The patentee no longer holds exclusive rights to the invention, which then becomes available for commercial exploitation by others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Rights conferred by a patent ===
The rights conferred by a patent are described in the patent law of the country in which the patent is granted. The patent owner’s exclusive rights generally consist of the following: 
* in the case of a product patent, the right to prevent third parties from making, using, offering for sale or selling the product, or importing it for these purposes, without the owner’s consent; and 
* in the case of a process patent, the right to prevent third parties from using the process without the owner’s consent; and to prevent third parties from using, offering for sale or selling the products obtained directly by that process, or importing them for these purposes, without the owner’s consent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The patentee is not given a statutory right to exploit the invention, but rather a statutory right to prevent others from commercially exploiting it. Patentees may give permission, or grant a license, to other parties to use their inventions on mutually agreed terms. They may also sell their patent rights to someone else, who then becomes the new patent owner. There are certain exceptions to the principle that a patented invention cannot legally be exploited without the authorization of the patent owner. These exceptions take into account the balance between the legitimate interests of the patent holder and those of competitors, consumers and others. For example, many patent laws allow a patented invention to be exploited without the patentee’s authorization: private acts for non-commercial purposes; acts for experimental purposes or scientific research; and acts for obtaining regulatory approval for pharmaceuticals. In addition, many laws provide for various situations under which compulsory licenses may be granted and government’s use of patented inventions without the authorization of the patent owner may be allowed in the wider public interest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Utility Models ==
{{Main|Utility model}}
Although not as widespread as patents, [[utility model]]s are also used to protect inventions. The rights conferred by utility models are similar to patent rights. Utility models are found in the laws of more than 50 countries, as well as in the regional agreements of the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) and the African Intellectual Property Organization (OAPI). In addition, certain countries, such as Australia and Malaysia, provide for titles of protection called innovation patents or utility innovations which are similar to utility models. Other countries, like Ireland and Slovenia, have a short-term patent equivalent to the utility model. The expression “utility model” refers to a title of protection for certain inventions, such as inventions in the mechanical field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Utility model protection is usually sought for technically less complex inventions or for inventions that have a short commercial life. The procedure for obtaining protection for a utility model is usually simpler than that for seeking patent protection. Substantive and procedural requirements under the applicable laws vary widely among the countries and regions with a utility model system; however, utility models usually differ from patents for invention in the following main respects:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The requirements for acquiring a utility model are less stringent than for patents. While the “novelty” requirement must always be met, that of “inventive step” (or “non-obviousness”) may be much less evident or absent altogether. In practice, protection for utility models is often sought for innovations of an incremental nature that may not meet patentability criteria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The maximum term of protectio provided for by law for a utility model is generally shorter than that provided for a patent for invention, usually between 7 and 10 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The fees required for obtaining and maintaining the right are generally lower than those for patents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Industrial Designs ==
{{Main|Industrial design}}
[[Industrial design]]s are applied to a wide variety of industrial products and handicrafts. They refer to the ornamental or aesthetic aspects of an article, including compositions of lines or colors or any three-dimensional forms that give a special appearance to a product or handicraft. The design must have aesthetic appeal. Moreover, it must be able to be reproduced by industrial means; this is the essential purpose of the design and the reason the design is called “industrial”. In a legal sense, an industrial design refers to the right granted in many countries, pursuant to a registration system, to protect the original, ornamental and nonfunctional features of a product resulting from design activity.Aesthetic appeal is one of the main factors influencing consumers in their product choice. Where the technical performance of a product offered by different manufacturers is relatively similar, consumers will make their selection based on price and aesthetic appeal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Aims of industrial design protection ===
By rewarding creators for their efforts, industrial design protection also serves as an incentive to invest in design activity. One of the basic aims of industrial design protection is to stimulate the design element of production. Industrial design laws therefore usually only protect designs that can be used in industry, or that can be produced on a large scale. This condition of industrial production is a notable difference between industrial design protection and copyright, since the latter concerns only aesthetic creations. However, in some cases, industrial designs may qualify for protection under copyright, for example where the design can be categorized as a work of applied art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Originality ===
Industrial designs can generally be protected if they are new or original. Designs may not meet these criteria if they do not differ significantly from other existing designs or combinations thereof. In most industrial design laws, designs dictated solely by the article’s function are excluded from protection. If the design for an article produced by many manufacturers, such as a screw, were to be dictated purely by the function the screw was intended to perform, then protection for that design would have the effect of excluding all other manufacturers from producing items intended to perform the same function. Such exclusion is not warranted unless the design is sufficiently novel and inventive to qualify for patent protection. In other words, the legal protection offered by industrial designs concerns only the design that is applied to, or embodied in, articles or products. This protection does not prevent other manufacturers from producing or dealing in similar articles or products, as long as these do not embody or reproduce the protected design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Protections ===
Industrial design registration protects against unauthorized exploitation of the design in industrial articles. It grants the owner of the design the exclusive right to make, import, sell, hire or offer for sale articles to which the design is applied or in which the design is embodied. The term for an industrial design right varies from country to country. The usual maximum term is from 10 to 25 years, often divided into terms requiring the proprietor to renew the registration in order to obtain an extension of protection. The relatively short period of protection may be related to the association of designs with more general styles of fashion, which tend to enjoy somewhat transient acceptance or success, particularly in highly fashion-conscious areas such as clothing or footwear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Intellectual Property with Regard to Integrated Circuits ==
Although prefabricated components of [[Electrical Circuit|electrical circuitry]] have been used in the manufacture of [[electrical equipment]] (e.g [[radio]]s) for some time, large-scale integration of a multitude of electrical functions in a very small component became possible as a result of advances in [[semiconductor]] technology. Integrated circuits are manufactured in accordance with very detailed plans or layout-designs.The layout-designs of integrated circuits are creations of the [[Mind|human mind]]. They are usually the result of vast investment, in terms both of expertise and financial resources. There is a continuing need for the creation of new layout-designs that simultaneously reduce the dimensions of existing integrated circuits and increase their functions. The smaller an integrated circuit, the less material is needed for its manufacture, and the smaller the space needed to accommodate it. Integrated circuits are used in a wide range of products, including articles of everyday use such as watches, televisions, washing machine sand cars, as well as sophisticated computers and servers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although creating a new layout-design for an integrated circuit involves a major investment, it is possible to copy layout designs for a fraction of that cost. Copying may be done by photographing each layer of an integrated circuit and preparing masks for the production of the integrated circuit on the basis of those photographs. The high cost of creating layout-designs and the relative ease of copying them are the main reasons they need protection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Layout-designs of integrated circuits are not considered industrial designs in the sense described in the laws providing for the registration of industrial designs. This is because they do not determine the external appearance of integrated circuits but rather the physical location, within the integrated circuit, of each element having an electronic function. Moreover, layout-designs of integrated circuits are not normally patentable inventions, because their creation usually does not involve an inventive step – even though it requires a great deal of work by an expert. Furthermore, copyright protection may not apply if national law determines that layout-designs cannot be copyrighted. In response to the uncertainty surrounding the protection of layout-designs, the [[WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits]] was adopted on May 26, 1989. The Treaty has not entered into force; however, its substantive provisions have, to a large extent, been incorporated by reference in the [[Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property|Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS Agreement), concluded in 1994.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trademarks ==
{{Main|Trademark}}
A [[trademark]] is a sign, or a combination of signs, that distinguishes the goods or services of one [[company]] from those of another. Such signs may use [[word]]s, letters, [[Number|numerals]], [[Image|pictures]], [[shape]]s and [[color]]s, or any combination thereof. An increasing number of countries also allow for the registration of less traditional forms of trademarks, such as three-dimensional signs (like the [[Coca-Cola]] bottle or [[Toblerone]] chocolate bar), audible signs (sounds such as the roar of the [[lion]] at the beginning of films produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]), or olfactory signs (such as the smell of a particular type of [[motor oil]] or [[embroidery yarn]]). However, many countries have set limits on what may be registered as a trademark, generally allowing only signs that are visually perceptible or can be represented graphically. Trademarks are used on goods or in connection with the market - ing of goods or services. The trademark may appear not only on the goods themselves but also on the container or packaging in which the goods are marketed. When used in connection with the sale of goods or services, the sign may appear in advertisements, for example, in newspapers, on television or in shop windows.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to trademarks identifying the commercial source of goods or services, several other categories of marks exist.

===Collective marks===
Collective marks are owned by an association, such as an association representing accountants or engineers, whose members use the mark to identify them with a particular level of quality and other requirements set by the association.

===Certification marks===
[[Certification mark]]s, such as the [[Woolmark]], are given for compliance with defined standards, but are not confined to any membership of an association.

===Service Mark===
A trademark used in connection with services is called a [[service mark]]. Service marks are used, for example, by [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[airline]]s, [[Tourism agency|tourist agencies]], car-rental agencies, [[Laundry|laundries]] and [[cleaner]]s. All that has been said about trademarks also applies to service marks.

===Functions of trademarks===
Broadly speaking, trademarks perform four main functions:

* Distinguish the products or services of one company from those of other companies. Trademarks facilitate the choice to be made by consumers when buying certain products or using certain services. The trademark helps consumers to identify a product or service they are already familiar with or one that has been advertised. The distinctive character of a mark must be evaluated in relation to the goods or services to which the mark is applied. For example, the word “apple” or the image of an apple cannot distinguish apples, but it is distinctive for computers. Trademarks not only distinguish products or services as such, they also distinguish them in relation to the company offering the products or services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Refer to a particular company, not necessarily known to the consumer, that offers the products or services on the market. Trademarks therefore distinguish products or services from a given source from identical or similar products or services from other sources. This function is important in defining the scope of trademark protection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Refer to a particular quality of the product or service for which a mark is used, so that consumers can rely on the consistent quality of the goods or services offered under that mark. This function is commonly referred to as the guarantee function of trademarks. A trademark is not always used by only one company, since the trademark owner may grant licenses to use the trademark to other companies. It is accordingly essential that licensees respect the quality standards of the trademark owner. Moreover, companies often use trademarks for products they acquire from various sources in the course of business. In such cases, trademark owners are not responsible for producing the products, but instead (and this may be equally important) for selecting those that meet their quality standards and requirements. Even where trademark owners are the manufacturers of a particular product, they may use parts they have selected but not produced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Promote the marketing and sale of products, and the marketing and provision of services. Trademarks are not only used to distinguish or refer to a particular company or quality, but also to stimulate sales. A trademark used in this way must be carefully selected. It must appeal to the consumer, create interest and inspire a feeling of confidence. This is sometimes called the communication function. The owner of a registered trademark has an exclusive right in respect of the mark: the right to use the mark and to prevent unauthorized third parties from using it, or a confusingly similar mark, so as to prevent consumers and the public in general from being misled. The period of protection varies, but a trademark can be renewed indefinitely on payment of the necessary fees and on condition that the mark is used. Trademark protection is enforced by the courts which, in most systems, have the authority to block trademark infringement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trade Names ==
{{Main|Trade name}}
Another category of industrial property covers commercial names and designations. A commercial or trade name is the name or designation that identifies a company. In most countries, trade names may be registered with a government authority. However, under Article 8 of the Paris Convention, a trade name must be protected without the obligation of filing or registration, whether or not it forms part of a trademark. Protection generally means that the trade name of one company may not be used by another company, either as a trade name or a trade or service mark – and that a name or designation similar to the trade name may not be used by another company if it is likely to mislead the public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Geographical Indications ==
{{Main|Geographical indication}}
A geographical indication is a sign used on goods that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation due to that place of origin. Agricultural products typically have qualities deriving from their place of production and that are influenced by specific local factors , such as climate and soil. Whether a sign functions as an indication is a matter of national law and consumer perception. Geographical indications may be used for a wide variety of agricultural products, such as “Tuscany” for olive oil produced in a specific area of Italy, or “Roquefort” for cheese produced in a certain region of France.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use of geographical indications is not limited to agricultural products. They may also highlight particular qualities of a product that are due to human factors found in the product’s place of origin, such as specific manufacturing skills and traditions. That place of origin may be a village or town, a region or a country. An example of a country geographical indication is “Switzerland” or “Swiss” for products made in Switzerland, in particular watches.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An appellation of origin is a special kind of geographical indication used on products that have a specific quality exclusively or essentially due to the geographical environment in which the products are produced. The term geographical indication encompasses appellations of origin. Examples of appellations of origin protected in states party to the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration are “Habana”, for tobacco grown in the Havana region of Cuba, and “Tequila”, for spirits produced in particular areas of Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Protections ===
Geographical indications are protected in accordance with national laws in a wide range of ways, such as under laws against unfair competition, consumer protection laws, laws for the protection of certification marks or special laws for the protection of geographical indications or appellations of origin. In essence, unauthorized parties may not use geographical indications where that use is likely to mislead the public as to the true origin of the product. Applicable sanctions range from court injunctions preventing unauthorized use to the payment of damages and fines or, in serious cases, imprisonment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Protection against Unfair Competition ==
Article 10 bis of the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] requires member countries to provide for protection against unfair competition. According to this article, the following acts of competition are considered contrary to honest trade and industry practices: 
* All acts of such a nature as to create confusion with the establishment, the goods or the industrial or commercial activities of a competitor; 
* False allegations in the course of trade of such a nature as to discredit the establishment, the goods or the industrial or commercial activities of a competitor; and 
* Indications or allegations, the use of which in the course of trade are liable to mislead the public as to the characteristics of certain goods. 
Protection against unfair competition supplements the protection of inventions, industrial designs, trademarks and geographical indications. It is particularly important for the protection of knowledge, technology or information that is not protected by a patent but that may be required in order to make best use of a patented invention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The Role of the World Intellectual Property Organization ==
{{Main|World Intellectual Property Organization}}
The [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) is an international organization dedicated to promoting creativity and innovation by ensuring that the rights of creators and owners of IP are protected worldwide, and that inventors and authors are recognized and rewarded for their ingenuity. As a specialized agency of the United Nations, WIPO provides a forum for its member states to create and harmonize rules and practices for protecting IP rights. Most developed countries have protection systems that are centuries old, while developing countries continue to create legal and administrative frameworks to protect their patents, trademarks, designs and copyright. WIPO assists its member states in developing these new systems through treaty negotiation, legal and technical assistance, and training in various forms, including in the area of enforcement of IP rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Systems ===
WIPO also provides international registration systems for trademarks, industrial designs and appellations of origin, and an international filing system for patents. These systems greatly simplify the process of seeking IP protection simultaneously in a large number of countries. Instead of having to file separate national applications, in different languages, in each country in which protection is sought, applicants can file a single application, in one language, with a single application fee. The WIPO-administered systems include four different mechanisms of protection for specific industrial property rights:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) System, for filing patent applications in multiple countries.
* the Madrid System for the International Registration of Marks, for trade and service marks. 
* the Hague System for the International Registration of Industrial Designs. 
* the Lisbon System for the International Registration of Appellations of Origin.

Anyone applying for a patent or registering a trademark or design, whether at the national or international level, needs to determine whether their creation is new or already owned or claimed by someone else. To do this, huge amounts of information must be searched. Four WIPO treaties have created classification systems that organise information on different branches of industrial property into indexed, manageable structures for easy retrieval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They are: 
* the Strasbourg Agreement Concerning the International Patent Classification; 
* the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks; • the Vienna Agreement Establishing an International Classification of the Figurative Elements of Marks; and 
* the Locarno Agreement Establishing an International Classification for Industrial Designs.

===WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center===
The WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center provides services for the resolution of international IP disputes between private parties. Such proceedings can include contractual disputes (such as patent and software licenses, trademark coexistence agreements, and research and development agreements) and non-contractual disputes (such as patent infringement). The Center is also recognized as the leading dispute resolution service provider for disputes arising from the abusive registration and use of Internet domain names.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''M.A.N.T.I.S.''''' is an American [[science fiction]] television series that aired for one season on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] between August 26, 1994 and March 3, 1995.

The original two-hour [[television pilot|pilot]] was produced by [[Sam Raimi]] and developed by [[Sam Hamm]].

==Plot==
A wealthy, mild-mannered doctor, Miles Hawkins, is shot in the spine during a riot, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.

After losing a lawsuit against a police officer he holds responsible, he uses his company's resources to invent a [[powered exoskeleton]] that not only enables him to walk but gives him superhuman abilities in the process.

Using a vast array of technology, including a large underwater lab and a [[hovercraft]] called the ''Crysalid'' to fly around the city, he assumes the persona of the vigilante "M.A.N.T.I.S." (Mechanically Augmented Neuro Transmitter Interception System).

The pilot featured [[Gina Torres]] as pathologist Dr. Amy Ellis, [[Bobby Hosea]] as reporter Yuri Barnes, and [[Wendy Raquel Robinson]] and [[Chris M. Brown (actor)|Christopher M. Brown]] as a pair of African students studying under Hawkins.

In the series, the supporting cast was changed to John Stonebrake, Taylor Savage and Lt. Maxwell, with the plot being completely rebooted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 'M.A.N.T.I.S.' Undergoes Pilot-to-Series Changes : New Producers of TV Series About an African American Super-Hero Cite Creative Reasons; Others Claim Racism |publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1994-08-25|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-25/entertainment/ca-31151_1_series-pilot|accessdate=2011-01-14|first=Greg|last=Braxton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of the series' run depicted the M.A.N.T.I.S. operating in a vigilante role, frequently pursued by police, and battling industrialist Solomon Box ([[Brion James]] / [[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew J. Robinson]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= TV REVIEWS : 'Mantis' a Super-Hero Without a Prayer |publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1994-01-24|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-24/entertainment/ca-14729_1_mantis-ii|accessdate=2011-01-14|first=Howard|last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the series' final installment, Miles Hawkins and Lt. Maxwell are killed disposing of an invisible prehistoric dinosaur.  John Stonebrake seals off the records and technology that had created the M.A.N.T.I.S., thus averting an apocalyptic future.  While the title character's death was given a sense of finality, the story was left open in one respect: when Miles Hawkins returned to 1994 from the year 2026 (a 32-year difference), he did so precisely 32 seconds after his vehicle sent him forward in time, thus altering the computer-controlled future that his disappearance had led to. As such, Miles Hawkins, while dying in the reality that he returned to, was also sent forward in time to an unknown future, leaving his actual fate ambiguous.

* [[Martin Cummins]] – Paul Benton / ... (3 episodes, 1994)
* [[Peter Brost]] – Young Dr. Miles Hawkins (3 episodes, 1994–1995)

==Production==
The series was produced in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. Many Vancouver landmarks, such as the dome of Science World, appear. It took three years to film due to Carl Lumbly being busy filming ''[[Nightjohn (film)|Nightjohn]]''. There were a number of differences between the pilot and the series. For example, in the pilot, Hawkins wore a suit over the exo-skeleton, it lacked a skullcap, and the headpiece was larger. The setting was changed from Oceania City to Port Columbia, and all of the characters, with Hawkins being an exception, were changed.

Poor ratings led to an extensive retooling of the concept.  Midway through the show's run, minor characters were jettisoned, and more fantasy adventure elements were incorporated into the premise, including [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], [[time travel]], super-villains, and monsters.  In one particular episode, the M.A.N.T.I.S. is accidentally thrown 32 years into the future, where he finds that his own technology has been exploited to create a supercomputer that is being used to enslave the Port Columbia population.  He destroys it and sets the human population free before returning to his own time.

'''Margaret Neilson Armstrong'''  (1867–1944) was a 20th-century American designer, illustrator, and author. She is best known for her book covers in the Art Nouveau style but also wrote and illustrated the first comprehensive guide to wildflowers of the American west. She also wrote mystery novels and biographies.

==Life==
Margaret Neilson Armstrong was born on September 24, 1867, in [[New York City]], the  daughter of American diplomat and stained glass artist [[Maitland Armstrong]] and his wife Helen, who was a descendant of [[Peter Stuyvesant]] and a niece of [[Hamilton Fish]].&lt;ref name=gullans/&gt;&lt;ref name=passing&gt;Evans, Curtis. [http://thepassingtramp.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/had-i-but-known-authors-2-margaret-n.html "Had I But Known Authors #2: Margaret Armstrong, HIBK Patrician"]. The Passing Tramp (blog), January 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Her six siblings included [[Helen Maitland Armstrong]] (1869–1948), who followed in her father's footsteps to become a stained glass artist, and [[Hamilton Fish Armstrong]], a magazine editor.

She began her career as a designer in the 1880s, working initially for [[A.C. McClurg]] and later for other publishers as well.&lt;ref name=coll&gt;[http://www.rarebook.com/index.php/collections/37-catalogues-lists/collections/79-margaret-armstrong-collection "Margaret Armstrong Decorated Bindings Collection"]&lt;/ref&gt; She designed more than 270 book covers and book bindings, about half of which were for [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner’s]].&lt;ref name=ua&gt;{{cite web|title=Margaret Neilson Armstrong (1867–1944)|url=http://bindings.lib.ua.edu/designerbios/armstrong.html|publisher=The University of Alabama|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked in the [[Art Nouveau]] style and favored plant-related motifs, bold colors, gold stamping, and often slightly asymmetrical designs—an unusual combination that helped to distinguish her among her peers.&lt;ref name=gullans/&gt;&lt;ref name=coll/&gt; Authors for whom she designed several covers include [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]], [[Florence L. Barclay]], [[George Washington Cable]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Henry van Dyke]], and [[Myrtle Reed]].&lt;ref name=coll/&gt; She has been called "the most productive and accomplished American book designer of the 1890s and early 1900s", and her work is often compared to that of her contemporary [[Alice Cordelia Morse]].&lt;ref name=passing/&gt;

Her monogram appears on many covers after 1895; it is a simple 'MA' in upper case with the 'M' slightly overlapping the 'A'.&lt;ref name=ua/&gt;

Armstrong cut back on book cover design around 1913 as [[dust jacket]]s began to come into fashion and turned to writing her own books. (Her signature style was so successful, however, that publishers then hired artists specifically to imitate her look.)&lt;ref name=coll/&gt; An avid naturalist, Armstrong's passion for natural forms reflected her interest in botany and in particular, in wildflowers. During the 1911-1914 period, she traveled and camped throughout the Western United States and Canada, becoming one of the first women to reach the bottom of the Grand Canyon. She discovered there several species of flowers that had not yet been identified by botanists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/704904397|title=Margaret Armstrong and American trade bindings: with a checklist of her designed bindings and covers|last=Gullans|first=Charles B|last2=Espey|first2=John Jenkins|last3=University of California|first3=Los Angeles|last4=Library|last5=Department of Special Collections|last6=Margaret Armstrong Binding Collection (Library of Congress)|date=1991-01-01|publisher=Department of Special Collections, University Research Library, University of California|year=|isbn=|location=Los Angeles|pages=51|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; She details those and many other species in her ''Field Book of Western Wild Flowers'' (1915). With its 550 illustrations (48 of which were in color), her ''Field Book'' is considered the first comprehensive guide on the subject.&lt;ref name=gullans&gt;Gullans, Charles, and John Espey.

Los Angeles: UCLA Library Department of Special Collections, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In her sixties and seventies, she wrote three critically praised mystery novels—''Murder in Stained Glass'' (1939), ''The Man with No Face'' (1940), and ''The Blue Santo Murder Mystery'' (1941)—and two biographies, ''Fanny Kemble: A Passionate Victorian'' (1938) and ''Trelawny: A Man's Life'' (1940). She also completed her father's memoirs.

She died in New York City in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Crista.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28347">The traditions of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] '''Mesoamerican literature''' extend back to the oldest-attested forms of early [[writing]] in the [[Mesoamerica]]n region, which date from around the mid-[[1st millennium BC|1st millennium BCE]]. Many of the [[pre-Columbian]] cultures of Mesoamerica are known to have been [[literacy|literate]] societies, who produced a number of [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] of varying degrees of complexity and completeness. Mesoamerican writing systems arose independently from other [[writing systems]] in the world,  and their development represents one of the very few such origins in the [[history of writing]]. The conquistadors brought their distinctive cultural baggage, in the form of books, from Spain to the New World.

The literature and texts created by indigenous Mesoamericans are the earliest-known from [[the Americas]] for primarily two reasons: Firstly the fact that the native populations of Mesoamerica were the first to enter into intensive contact with Europeans, assuring that many samples of Mesoamerican literature have been documented in surviving and intelligible forms.  Secondly, the long tradition of Mesoamerican writing which undoubtedly contributed to the native Mesoamericans readily embracing the [[Latin alphabet]] of the Spaniards and creating many literary works written in it during the first centuries after the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]]. This article summarizes current knowledge about indigenous Mesoamerican literatures in its broadest sense and describe it categorized by its literary contents and social functions.

[[File:Codex Borbonicus, p11 trecena13.PNG|right|300px|thumb|A reproduction of the original page 13 of the [[Codex Borbonicus]], showing elements of an almanac associated with the 13th ''[[trecena]]'' of the ''[[tonalpohualli]]'', the [[Aztec]] version of the [[260-day Mesoamerican calendar]].]]

==Precolumbian literature==
When defining literature in its broadest possible sense including all products of "literacy", what becomes primarily interesting about a literate community is the manner in which literacy and literature is used.  Which topics are chosen to be written and spoken about? And why did they do it?  Which genres of literature are found in Mesoamerica?
The answer to this question is complex and is the topic of the rest of this article that will try to describe and resume what is known about the genres and functions of indigenous Mesoamerican literatures.

Three major subjects of Mesoamerican literatures can be identified:
*Religion, time and astronomy : Mesoamerican civilizations shared an interest in the recording and keeping track of time through observation of celestial bodies and religious rituals celebrating their different phases. Not surprisingly a large portion of the Mesoamerican literature that has been delivered down through time to us deals exactly with this kind of information. Particularly the true precolumbian literature such as the [[Mayan codices|Mayan]] and [[Aztec codices]]  deal with calendrical and astronomical information as well as describing the rituals connected to the passing of time.
*History, power and legacy: Another large part of the Precolumbian literature is found carved into monumental structures such as stelae, altars  and temples. This kind of literature typically documents power and heritage, memorize victories, ascension to rulership, dedications of monuments, marriages between royal lineages.
* Mythical and fictive genres. Mostly present in postconquest versions but often relying on oral or pictorial traditions the mythical and narrative literature of Mesoamerica is very rich, and we can only guess as to how much has been lost.
*Every day literature. Some texts are sort of every day literature such as descriptions of objects and their owners, graffiti inscriptions, but these only constitutes a very small part of the known literature.

===Pictorial vs. linguistic literature===

[[Geoffrey Sampson]] distinguishes between two kinds of writing. One kind of writing he calls 'semasiographical', this covers kinds of pictorial or [[ideographic]] writing that is not necessarily connected to [[phonetic]] language but can be read in different languages, this kind of writing is for example used in roadsigns which can be read in any language. The other kind of writing is phonetic writing called by Sampson 'glottographic' writing and which represents the sounds and words of languages and allows accurate linguistic readings of a text that is the same at every reading.{{sfnp|Sampson|1985}} In Mesoamerica the two types were not distinguished, and so writing, drawing, and making pictures were seen as closely related if not identical concepts. In both the [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] and [[Nahuatl languages|Aztec]] languages there is one word for writing '''and''' drawing ((''tlàcuiloa'' in Nahuatl and ''tz'iib' '' in [[Classic Maya language|Classic Maya]])) Pictures are sometimes read phonetically and texts meant to be read are sometimes very pictorial in nature. This makes it difficult for modern day scholars to distinguish between whether an inscription in a [[Mesoamerican writing systems|Mesoamerican script]] represents spoken language or is to be interpreted as a descriptive drawing. The only Mesoamerican people known without doubt to have developed a completely glottographic or phonetic script is the Maya, and even the Mayan script is largely pictorial and often shows fuzzy boundaries between images and text. Scholars disagree on the phoneticity of other Mesoamerican scripts and [[iconography|iconographic]] styles, but many show use of the [[Rebus principle]] and a highly conventionalised set of [[symbology|symbols]].

===Monumental Inscriptions===
[[File:NaranjoStela10Maler.jpg|100px|right|thumb|An Monumental inscription in Maya hieroglyphics from the site of [[Naranjo]], relating to the reign of king ''Itzamnaaj K'awil'']]
The monumental inscriptions were often historical records of the citystates:
Famous examples include:
*Hieroglyphic Stair of Copan recording the history of [[Copan]] with 7000 glyphs on its 62 steps.
*The inscriptions of [[Naj Tunich]] records the arrival of noble pilgrims to the sacred cave.
*The tomb inscriptions of [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal|Pacal]] the famous ruler of Palenque.
*The many stelae of [[Yaxchilan]], [[Quiriguá]], [[Copán]], [[Tikal]] and [[Palenque]] and countless other Mayan archaeological sites.

The function of these kinds of historical inscriptions also served to consoliate the power of the rulers who used them also as a kind of propaganda testimonies to their power. Most commonly monumental hieroglyphocal texts describe:
*Lordship: ascension and death of rulers, and the claiming of ancestry from noble lineages
*Warfare: Victories and conquest
*Alliances: Marriages between lineages.
*Dedications of monuments and buildings

The epigrapher David Stuart writes about the differences in content between the monumental hieroglyphical texts of Yaxchilan and those of Copan:   
:"The major themes of the known Yaxchilan monuments are war, dance, and bloodletting rituals, with several records of architectural dedicatory rites." Most of the records of wars and dances accompany scenes of the rulers, who are featured prominently in all of the texts. Copán's texts have a far lesser emphasis on historical narrative. The stelae of the great plaza, for example, are inscribed with dedicatory formulae that name the ruler as "owner" of the monument, but they seldom if ever record any ritual or historical activity. Birth dates at Copán are virtually nonexistent, as also are records of war and capture. The Copán rulers therefore lack some of the personalized history we read in the texts of newer centers in the western lowlands, such as Palenque, Yaxchilan, and Piedras Negras."&lt;ref&gt;David Stuart, [https://web.archive.org/web/20081216020327/http://www.peabody.harvard.edu/Copan/text.html David Stuart writes about the inscriptions of Copán]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Codices===
;: See also [[Mayan codices]] and [[Aztec codices]] for fuller descriptions of a number of codices.
Most codices date from the colonial era, with only a few surviving from the [[Precolumbian|prehispanic era]]. A number of Precolumbian codices written on ''[[amate]]'' paper with gesso coating remain today.

==Postconquest literatures written in Latin script==
[[File:The_Florentine_Codex-_Aztec_Feather_Painters_III.tif|thumb|right|Aztec feather artisans or painters. [[Florentine Codex]] (ca. 1576) with native drawings and [[Nahuatl]] text]]
The largest part of the Mesoamerican literature today known has been fixed in writing after the Spanish conquest. Both Europeans and Mayans began writing down local oral tradition using the Latin alphabet to write in indigenous languages shortly after the conquest. Many of those Europeans were [[friars]] and priests who in trying to convert the natives to Christianity. They translated Catholic catechisms and confessional manuals and acquired a good grasp of the indigenous languages and often even composed grammars and dictionaries of the indigenous languages.  These early grammars of native languages systematized the reading and writing of indigenous languages in their own time and help us understand them today.

The most widely known early grammars and dictionaries are of the Aztec language, Nahuatl. Famous examples are the works written by [[Alonso de Molina]] and [[Andrés de Olmos]]. But also Mayan and other Mesoamerican languages have early grammars and dictionaries, some of very high quality.

The introduction of the Latin alphabet and the elaboration of conventions for writing indigenous languages allowed for the subsequent creation of a wide range of texts. And indigenous writers took advantage of the new techniques to document their own history and tradition in the new writing, while monks kept on extending literacy in the indigenous population. This tradition lasted only a few centuries however and due to royal decrees about Spanish being the only language of the Spanish empire by the mid-1700s most indigenous languages were left without a living tradition for writing. Oral literature, however, kept being transmitted to this day in many indigenous languages and began to be collected by ethnologists in the beginnings of the 20th century, however without promoting native language literacy in the communities in which they worked. It is an important and extremely difficult job in the Mesoamerica of today, and what that is only beginning to be undertaken, to return native language literacy to the indigenous peoples. But during the first post-conquest centuries a large number of texts in indigenous Mesoamerican languages were generated.

===Codices of major importance===
[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 2r.jpg|thumb|left|Founding of [[Tenochtitlan]], [[Codex Mendoza]]]].
::*[[Codex Mendoza]]
::*[[Florentine Codex]]. A twelve-volume work composed under the direction of [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] and sent to Europe in 1576. Separate books deal with Aztec religion, divinatory practices; lords and rulers; elite long-distance merchants [[pochteca]]; commoners; the "earthly things" including a compendium of information on flora and fauna; rocks and soil types. Volume 12 is a history of the conquest from the Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco viewpont. It is called the "Florentine Codex" because it was found in a library in Florence, Italy.

===Historical accounts===
[[Image:NunoBeltranGuzman-1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Conquistador [[Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán]] as depicted in the annal[[Codex Telleriano Remensis]]]]
Many of the post-conquest texts are historical accounts, either in the form of annals recounting year by year the events of a people or city-state often based on pictorial documents or oral accounts of aged community members. But also sometimes personalized literary accounts of the life of a people or state and almost always incorporating both mythical material and actual history. There was no formal distinction between the two in Mesoamerica. Sometimes as in the case of the Mayan [[Chilam Balam]] books historical accounts also incorporated prophetical material, a kind of ''history in advance''.

===Administrative documents ===
{{Main|New Philology}}
The post-conquest situation of the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica also required them to learn to navigate in a complex new administrative system. In order to obtain any kinds of favorable positions pleas and petitions had to be made to the new authorities and land possessions and heritages had to be proven. This resulted in a large corpus of administrative literature in indigenous languages, because documents were often written in the native language first and later translated into Spanish. Historians of central Mexican peoples draw heavily on native-language documentation, most notably [[Charles Gibson (historian)|Charles Gibson]] in ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'' (1964)&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule''. Stanford University Press 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] in ''The Nahuas After the Conquest'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest''. Stanford University Press 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis on native-language documentation for indigenous history has been emphasized in the [[New Philology]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Restall, "A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History", ''Latin American Research Review'' - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp. 113–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'', James Lockhart, Lisa Sousa, and Stephanie Wood (eds.), Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

These administrative documents include a large number of:
[[File:Oztoticpac_Lands_Aztec_1540_milcocolli_tlahuelmantli.jpg|thumb|left|Oztoticpac Lands Map]]
*'''Testaments''' (legal wills of individual indigenous, sometimes kept together as books of testaments). Testaments have been utilized as a source of information on individuals, and where they appear as clusters, they give even fuller information about indigenous culture, kin relations, and economic practices.  Starting in 1976, testaments have been published as an example of the potential of Mesoamerican native-language documentation, part of what is currently called the [[New Philology]].  A number collections of wills have been published, including four volumes resulting from a Mexican government-funded project ''La vida cotidiana indígena y su transformación en la época colonial a través de los testamentos''.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Rojas Rabiela, et al.''Vidas y bienes olvidados: Testamentos indigenas novohispanos''. (Mexico: CIESAS/CONACYT 1999-2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some particularly rich collections of wills have been published, followed by a monograph utilizing them.  In recent years, anthologies of indigenous testaments have been published from Mesoamerica and elsewhere.
**''The Testaments of Culhuacan'', a set sixteenth-century wills bound together as a book, concentrated in the 1580s&lt;ref&gt;S.L. Cline and [[Miguel León-Portilla]], ''The Testaments of Culhuacan''. UCLA Latin American Center Publications 1984&lt;/ref&gt; and the source for a social history of the town.&lt;ref&gt;S.L. Cline, ''Colonial Culhuacan: A Social History of an Aztec Town''. University of New Mexico Press 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
**''The Ixil Testaments'', a book of Yucatec Maya native-language wills from the 1760s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Restall]], ''Life and Death in a Maya Community: The Ixil Testaments of the 1760s''. Labyrinthos 1995&lt;/ref&gt; used as a source of Yucatec Maya history.&lt;ref&gt;Mattthew Restall, ''The Maya World: Yucatec culture and society, 1550-1850'' (Stanford University Press 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Cabildo records''' (indigenous town council records), a notable example is from Tlaxcala&lt;ref&gt;''The Tlaxcalan Actas: A Compendium of the Records of the Cabildo of Tlaxcala (1545-1627)''. James Lockhart, Frances Berdan, and Arthur J.O. Anderson. 1986. University of Utah Press. {{ISBN|978-0874802535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Censuses and tribute records''' (house to house censuses give important information about kinship, residence patterns, and economic information about landholding and tribute obligations).  Important examples from the Cuernavaca region, Huexotzinco, and Texcoco.&lt;ref&gt;''Azteckischer Zensus, Zur indianischen Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft im Marquesado um 1540: Aus dem "Libro de Tributos"'' (Col.

Cline|Cline, Howard F.]], "The Oztoticpac Lands Map of Texcoco 1540." The Quarterly Journal of the Library of Congress 23, no. 2 (1966): 76-115. https://www.jstor.org/stable/29781211.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Relaciones geográficas''===
{{Main|Relaciones geográficas}}
In the late sixteenth-century the Spanish crown sought systematic information about indigenous settlements now part of the [[Spanish Empire]]. A questionnaire was drawn up and local Spanish officials gathered information from the indigenous towns under their administration, using local elites as their informants. Some reports were a few pages, such as that from [[Culhuacan (altepetl)|Culhuacan]], while some major indigenous polities, such as Tlaxcala, took the opportunity to give a detailed description of their prehispanic history and participation in the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire|Spanish conquest of central Mexico]].  Most geographical accounts include a native map of the settlement. The ''[[Relaciones geográficas]]'' were produced because colonial officials complied with royal instructions, but their content was generated by indigenous informants or authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard F. Cline]], "The Relaciones Geográficas of the Spanish Indies, 1577-1586." ''[[Hispanic American Historical Review]]'' 44, (1964) 341-374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "A Census of the Relaciones Geográficas, 1579-1612." ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]], vol. 12: 324-69. Austin: University of Texas Press 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara E. Mundy, ''The Mapping of New Spain: Indigenous Cartography and the Maps of the Relaciones Geográficas''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythological narratives===
The most extensively researched Mesoamerican indigenous literature is the literature containing mythological and legendary narratives. The styles of these books is often very poetic and appealing to modern aesthetic senses both because of the poetic language and its "mystical", exotic contents. It is also of interest to establish [[intertextuality]] between cultures. While many do include actual historic events the mythological texts can often be distinguished by focusing on claiming a mythical source to power by tracing the lineage of a people to some ancient source of power.{{sfnp|Carrasco|1998}}

*[[Popol Vuh]] (the legendary mythological history of the [[K'iche' people|Quiché people]])
*[[Codex Chimalpopoca]] (the main source of the Aztec creation myth of the [[Five Suns]])
*[[Codex Aubin]] (recounting the mythical wanderings of the Mexica from Aztlan and to Tenochtitlan)
*[[Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca]] (the Aztec myth of the legendary Toltec and Chichimec peoples)

===Poetry===
Some famous collections of Aztec poetry have been conserved. Although written in the late 16th century they are believed to be fairly representative of the actual style of poetry used in precolumbian times. Many of the poems are attributed to named Aztec rulers such as [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]]. Because the poems were transcribed at a later date, scholars dispute whether these are the actual authors. Many of the mythical and historical texts also have poetic qualities.

*''Coloquios y doctrina Christiana'' (also known as the Bancroft dialogues, describing the first dialogues between Aztecs and monks preaching Christianity)

===Collections of disparate treatises===
Not all specimens of native literature can be readily classified. A prime example of this are the Yucatec Mayan Books of [[Chilam Balam]], mentioned above for their historical content, but also containing treatises on medical lore, astrology, etc. Although clearly belonging to Maya literature, they are profoundly syncretic in nature.

This large, mid-19th century [[Morocco|Moroccan]] wall hanging, or ''haiti,'' is a highlight of the textile collection of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. Made in the cultural center of [[Fes|Fez]], it is crafted of the finest materials: [[Velvet#Fibres|silk velvet]] embroidered with [[gold]] metallic thread.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The seven panels of this wall hanging, in alternating crimson and emerald velvet, were sewn not by women, as was typical of Moroccan embroidery, but by professional male needleworkers. That is because this ''haiti'' represents the most prestigious and complicated form of textile. The men were under close supervision by the leatherworkers' guild, since the work was so complex it required custom-made leather templates. They stitched around the templates with a special technique known as [[Couching#Variants|underside couching]] that kept the precious gold thread from being wasted on the unseen underside. The interlaced ''[[mihrab]]'' motif, echoing a [[mosque]]'s arch-shaped niche, makes this wall hanging a magnificent backdrop for special occasions.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

==Historical information==
Artisans in Fez had been creating sumptuous wall hangings like this since the 16th century. Magnificent embroideries of this particular type, with their large size and architectural elements, were reserved for very grand occasions such as the week-long weddings of the very wealthy. They provided a suitable backdrop for the bride in her lavish finery.&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|year=1988|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location history==
In 2003, the IMA loaned this artwork to the [[National Museum of African Art]] as part of an exhibit entitled "The Fabric of Moroccan Art," which was sponsored by [[Mohammed VI]], king of Morocco. Of the dozens of textiles displayed, this one was lauded as "One of the most important pieces in the exhibition--and in the IMA's entire textile collection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lorenz|first=Joyce L.|title=Moroccan Rugs and Textiles|url=http://friendsofmorocco.org/Souk/FabricofMoroccanLife.htm|publisher=Friends of Morocco|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition==
This ''haiti'' was donated to the IMA by Eliza M. and Sarah L. Niblack in 1932. It became an official part of the museum's collection in 1983 per Sarah's bequest, and was given the accession number 1983.66.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=wall hanging (haiti)|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/wall-hanging-haiti|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Niblack family had acquired it when Admiral [[Albert Parker Niblack]], Eliza's brother, was stationed in [[Gibraltar]] in 1917. His discerning eye led to a collection of 2,500 Moroccan, European, and [[Indonesia]]n textiles, all of which found their way into the IMA's collection. The family's generosity means the museum holds one of the most important collections of Moroccan textiles in the United States, since most institutions focus on [[Turkey|Turkish]] and [[Persia]]n textiles.&lt;ref name=wt&gt;{{cite journal|title=Moroccan mastery with textiles|journal=[[Washington Times]]|date=18 July 2003|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/jul/18/20030718-082637-2428r/?page=all|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mother______! Mother______!''''' is a 1980 album by [[Clark Terry]] featuring [[Zoot Sims]], of a jazz symphony composed by Charles Schwartz. Terry and Sims are accompanied on the album by an octet, the Contemporary Chamber Ensemble and the soprano Joan Heller.&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=mother-!-mother-!-mw0000267776|label=Mother______!

==Reception==
{{Album ratings
|rev1 = [[Allmusic]]
|rev1score = {{Rating|3|5}}&lt;ref name="Allmusic"/&gt;
}}
Ken Dryden reviewed the album for [[Allmusic]] and wrote that "Although Terry is in great form, the music will be rather challenging for most fans of Terry's jazz recordings to enjoy, and Heller's vocals prove to be more of a distraction than a complementary factor. The front cover is unusually bland for Pablo, filled with the composer's liner notes instead of photos from the studio session. ...this record is worth picking up if found at a reasonable price by serious fans of Clark Terry, but the typical jazz listener can safely bypass this release."&lt;ref name="Allmusic"/&gt;

'''Peter Seeger''' (May 3, 1919&amp;nbsp;– January 27, 2014) was an American folk singer and [[social activist]]. A fixture on nationwide radio in the 1940s, he also had a string of hit records during the early 1950s as a member of [[the Weavers]], most notably their recording of [[Lead Belly]]'s "[[Goodnight, Irene]]", which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950. Members of the Weavers were [[blacklist]]ed during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Era]]. In the 1960s, Seeger re-emerged on the public scene as a prominent singer of [[protest song|protest music]] in support of [[nuclear disarmament|international disarmament]], [[civil rights]], [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], and [[environmentalism|environmental causes]].

A prolific songwriter, his best-known songs include "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]" (with [[Joe Hickerson]]), "[[If I Had a Hammer|If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song)]]" (with [[Lee Hays]] of the Weavers), and "[[Turn! Turn! Turn! (song)|Turn! Turn! Turn!]]", which have been recorded by many artists both in and outside the folk revival movement and are sung throughout the world. "Flowers" was a hit recording for [[the Kingston Trio]] (1962); [[Marlene Dietrich]], who recorded it in English, German and French (1962); and [[Johnny Rivers]] (1965). "If I Had a Hammer" was a hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] (1962) and [[Trini Lopez]] (1963) while [[the Byrds]] had a number one hit with "Turn! Turn! Turn!" in 1965.

Seeger was one of the folk singers responsible for popularizing the [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]] "[[We Shall Overcome]]" (also recorded by [[Joan Baez]] and many other singer-activists) that became the acknowledged anthem of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], soon after folk singer and activist [[Guy Carawan]] introduced it at the founding meeting of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) in 1960. In the [[PBS]] ''[[American Masters]]'' episode "[[Pete Seeger: The Power of Song]]", Seeger said it was he who changed the lyric from the traditional "We will overcome" to the more singable "We shall overcome".

==Family and personal life==
Seeger was born on May 3, 1919, at the [[French Hospital (Manhattan)|French Hospital]], Midtown Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-dreier/honor-pete-seeger_b_1883818.html | title=Honor Pete Seeger | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=September 14, 2013 | accessdate=July 13, 2013 | author=Clapp, E.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Yankee-Protestant{{clarify|date=June 2017 &lt;!--what exactly is a "yankee-protestant"?--&gt;}} family, which Seeger called "enormously Christian, in the [[Puritan]], [[Calvinist]] New England tradition",&lt;ref&gt;[[David King Dunaway]], ''How Can I Keep From Singing'' (New York: [Random House, 1981, 1990], revised edition, Villard Books, 2008), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; traced its genealogy back over 200 years. A paternal ancestor, Karl Ludwig Seeger, a doctor from [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]], Germany, had emigrated to America during the [[American Revolution]] and married into the old New England family of Parsons in the 1780s.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=LRP0Q7LJU_IC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=Ann+M.+Pescatello+great-grandfather+Karl+Ludwig+Seeger&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LZ5iT-uyKuLw0gGH4tCqCA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Ann M. Pescatello, ''Charles Seeger: A Life in American Music'' (University of Pittsburgh, 1992), pp. 4–5.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeger's father, the [[Harvard]]-trained composer and musicologist&lt;ref name=pc1/&gt; [[Charles Seeger|Charles Louis Seeger, Jr.]], was born in Mexico City, Mexico, to American parents. Charles established the first musicology curriculum in the U.S. at the University of California in 1913, helped found the [[American Musicological Society]], and was a key founder of the academic discipline of [[ethnomusicology]]. Pete's mother, Constance de Clyver (née Edson),{{Clarify|date=July 2016|reason=Why changed surname, but not to husband's?}} raised in [[Tunisia]] and trained at the [[Paris Conservatory of Music]], was a concert violinist and later a teacher at the [[Juilliard School]].&lt;ref name=d20&gt;Dunaway (2008), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Professor Charles Louis Seeger, his wife Constance, and their sons, 23 May 1921.jpg|400px|thumb|Peter Seeger (on father's lap) with his father and mother, Charles and Constance Seeger and brothers on a camping trip (23 May 1921).]]
In 1912, his father Charles Seeger was hired to establish the music department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], but was forced to resign in 1918 because of his outspoken [[pacifism]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Dunaway, the British-born president of the university "all but fired" Charles Seeger (''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 26).&lt;/ref&gt; Charles and Constance moved back east, making Charles' parents' estate in [[Patterson, New York]], northeast of New York City, their base of operations. When baby Pete was eighteen months old, they set out with him and his two older brothers in a homemade trailer to bring musical uplift to the working people in the American South.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Pescatello, ''Charles Seeger: A Life In Music'', 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their return, Constance taught violin and Charles taught composition at the New York [[Institute of Musical Art]] (later [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]]), whose president, family friend [[Frank Damrosch]], was Constance's adoptive "uncle". Charles also taught part-time at the [[New School for Social Research]]. Career and money tensions led to quarrels and reconciliations, but when Charles discovered Constance had opened a secret bank account in her own name, they separated, and Charles took custody of their three sons.&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 32. Frank Damrosch, siding with Constance, fired Charles from Juilliard, see Judith Tick, ''Ruth Crawford Seeger: a Composer's Search for American Music'' (Oxford University Press, 1997), pp. 224–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1936, Charles held various administrative positions in the federal government's [[Resettlement Administration|Farm Resettlement program]], the [[Works Projects Administration|WPA]]'s [[Federal Music Project]] (1938–1940) and the wartime [[Pan American Union]]. After [[World War II]], he taught [[ethnomusicology]] at the University of California and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', pp. 22, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w4&gt;Winkler (2009), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles and Constance divorced when Pete was seven and in 1932 Charles married his composition student and assistant, [[Ruth Crawford Seeger|Ruth Crawford]], now considered by many to be one of the most important [[Modernism (music)|modernist]] composers of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;See Judith Tick, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Ruth_Crawford_Seeger.html?id=xwLTDOR8LUYC' ''Ruth Crawford Seeger: a Composer's Search for American Music'' (1997).]&lt;/ref&gt; Deeply interested in folk music, Ruth had contributed musical arrangements to [[Carl Sandburg]]'s extremely influential folk song anthology [[Carl Sandburg#Folk music|the ''American Songbag'']] (1927) and later created significant original settings for eight of Sandburg's poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peggyseeger.com/ruth-crawford-seeger/ruth-crawford-seeger-biography |title=David Lewis, '&amp;#39;Ruth Crawford Seeger Biography in 600 Words'&amp;#39; on website of her daughter, Peggy Seeger |publisher=Peggyseeger.com |date=February 14, 2005 |accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete's eldest brother, Charles Seeger III, was a radio astronomer, and his next older brother, John Seeger, taught in the 1950s at the [[Dalton School]] in Manhattan and was the principal from 1960 to 1976 at [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Fieldston Lower School]] in [[the Bronx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peteseegersite.wordpress.com/2010/01/18/john-seeger-dies-at-95/|title=John Seeger Dies at 95|date=January 18, 2010|work=[[WordPress.com]]|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete's uncle, [[Alan Seeger]], a noted poet ("I Have a Rendezvous with Death"), had been one of the first American soldiers to be killed in [[World War I]]. All four of Pete's half-siblings from his father's second marriage – Margaret (Peggy), Mike, Barbara, and Penelope (Penny) – became folk singers. [[Peggy Seeger]], a well-known performer in her own right, married British folk singer and activist [[Ewan MacColl]]. [[Mike Seeger]] was a founder of the [[New Lost City Ramblers]], one of whose members, [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], married Pete's half-sister Penny – also a talented singer who died young. Barbara Seeger joined her siblings in recording folk songs for children. In 1935, Pete attended Camp Rising Sun, an international leadership camp held every summer in upstate New York that influenced his life's work. He visited it most recently in 2012.

In 1943, Pete married [[Toshi Seeger|Toshi Aline Ota]], whom he credited with being the support that helped make the rest of his life possible. The couple remained married until Toshi's death in July 2013.&lt;ref name="wife"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/arts/music/toshi-seeger-wife-of-folk-singing-legend-dies-at-91.html?_r=0 | title=Toshi Seeger, Wife of Folk-Singing Legend, Dies at 91 | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 12, 2013 | accessdate=July 12, 2013 | author=Martin, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first child, Peter Ōta Seeger, was born in 1944 and died at six months, while Pete was deployed overseas. Pete never saw him.&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to have three more children: Daniel (an accomplished photographer and filmmaker), [[Mika Seeger|Mika]] (a potter and muralist), and Tinya (a potter), as well as grandchildren [[Tao Rodríguez-Seeger]] (a musician), Cassie (an artist), Kitama Cahill-Jackson (a psychotherapist), Moraya (a marriage and family therapist married to the NFL player [[Chris DeGeare]]), Penny, Isabelle, and great-grandchildren Dio and Gabel. Tao, a folk musician in his own right, sings and plays guitar, banjo, and harmonica with [[the Mammals]]. Kitama Jackson is a documentary filmmaker who was associate producer of the [[PBS]] documentary ''[[Pete Seeger: The Power of Song]]''.

When asked by [[Beliefnet]] about his religious or spiritual beliefs, and his definition of God, Seeger replied:

{{Quote|text=Nobody knows for sure. But people undoubtedly get feelings which are not explainable and they feel they're talking to God or they're talking to their parents who are long dead. I feel most spiritual when I'm out in the woods. I feel part of nature. Or looking up at the stars. [I used to say] I was an atheist. Now I say, it's all according to your definition of God. According to my definition of God, I'm not an atheist. Because I think God is everything. Whenever I open my eyes I'm looking at God. Whenever I'm listening to something I'm listening to God. I've had preachers of the gospel, Presbyterians and Methodists, saying, "Pete, I feel that you are a very spiritual person." And maybe I am. I feel strongly that I'm trying to raise people's spirits to get together. […] I tell people I don't think God is an old white man with a long white beard and no navel; nor do I think God is an old black woman with white hair and no navel. But I think God is literally everything, because I don't believe that something can come out of nothing. And so there's always been something. Always is a long time.|&lt;ref&gt;

Seeger lived in [[Beacon, New York]]. He remained engaged politically and maintained an active lifestyle in the [[Hudson Valley]] region of New York throughout his life.

==Career==
===Early work===
[[File:Pete Seeger-1979.jpg|thumb|Seeger in 1979]]
At four, Seeger was sent away to [[boarding school]] but came home two years later when his parents learned the school had failed to inform them he had contracted [[scarlet fever]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer" (2006) p. 50 and Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended first and second grades in [[Nyack, New York]], where his mother lived, before entering boarding school in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;Alec Wilkinson, ''The Protest Singer: An Intimate Portrait of Pete Seeger'' (New York: Knopf, 2009), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being classical musicians, his parents did not press him to play an instrument. On his own, the otherwise bookish and withdrawn boy gravitated to the [[ukulele]], becoming adept at entertaining his classmates with it while laying the basis for his subsequent remarkable audience rapport. At thirteen, Seeger enrolled in the [[Avon Old Farms School]] in [[Avon, Connecticut]], from which he graduated in 1936. He was selected to attend [[Camp Rising Sun (New York)|Camp Rising Sun]], the [[George E. Jonas Foundation]]'s international summer leadership program. During the summer of 1936, while traveling with his father and stepmother, Pete heard the five-string [[banjo]] for the first time at the [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford#The Mountain Dance and Folk Festival|Mountain Dance and Folk Festival]] in western [[North Carolina]] near [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], organized by local [[folkloristics|folklorist]], lecturer, and traditional music performer [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]], whom Charles Seeger had hired for [[Resettlement Administration|Farm Resettlement]] music projects.&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival took place in a covered baseball field. There the Seegers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;watched square-dance teams from Bear Wallow, Happy Hollow, Cane Creek, Spooks Branch, Cheoah Valley, Bull Creek, and Soco Gap; heard the five-string banjo player [[Samantha Bumgarner]]; and family string bands, including a group of Indians from the Cherokee reservation who played string instruments and sang ballads. They wandered among the crowds who camped out at the edge of the field, hearing music being made there as well. As Lunsford's daughter would later recall, those country people "held the riches that Dad had discovered. They could sing, fiddle, pick the banjos, and guitars with traditional grace and style found nowhere else but deep in the mountains. I can still hear those haunting melodies drift over the ball park."&lt;ref name="Judith Tick p. 239"&gt;Judith Tick, ''Ruth Crawford Seeger'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

For the Seegers, experiencing the beauty of this music firsthand was a "conversion experience". Pete was deeply affected and, after learning basic strokes from Lunsford, spent much of the next four years trying to master the five-string banjo.&lt;ref name="Judith Tick p. 239"/&gt; The teenage Seeger also sometimes accompanied his parents to regular Saturday evening gatherings at the [[Greenwich Village]] loft of painter and art teacher [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] and his wife Rita. Benton, a lover of Americana, played [[Cindy (folk song)|"Cindy"]] and "[[Old Joe Clark]]" with his students [[Charles Pollock|Charlie]] and [[Jackson Pollock]]; friends from the [[Old-time music|"hillbilly"]] recording industry; as well as [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] composers [[Carl Ruggles]] and [[Henry Cowell]]. It was at one of Benton's parties that Pete heard "[[John Henry (folklore)#Music|John Henry]]" for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Tick, ''Ruth Crawford Seeger'', p. 235. According to John Szwed, Jackson Pollock, later famous for his "drip" paintings, played harmonica, having smashed his violin in frustration, see: ''Alan Lomax: The Man Who Recorded the World'' (Viking, 2010), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeger enrolled at [[Harvard College]] on a partial scholarship, but as he became increasingly involved with politics and folk music, his grades suffered and he lost his scholarship. He dropped out of college in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;According to Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer" (2006), p. 51, after failing one of his winter exams and losing his scholarship.&lt;/ref&gt; He dreamed of a career in journalism and took courses in art, as well. His first musical gig was leading students in folk singing at the [[Dalton School]], where his aunt was principal. He polished his performance skills during a summer stint of touring New York State with The Vagabond Puppeteers (Jerry Oberwager, 22; Mary Wallace, 22; and Harriet Holtzman, 23), a traveling [[puppet theater]] "inspired by rural education campaigns of post-revolutionary Mexico".&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', pp. 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt; One of their shows coincided with a strike by dairy farmers. The group reprised its act in October in New York City. An article in the October 2, 1939, ''[[Daily Worker]]'' reported on the Puppeteers' six-week tour this way:

{{quote|During the entire trip the group never ate once in a restaurant. They slept out at night under the stars and cooked their own meals in the open, very often they were the guests of farmers. At rural affairs and union meetings, the farm women would bring "suppers" and would vie with each other to see who could feed the troupe most, and after the affair the farmers would have earnest discussions about who would have the honor of taking them home for the night.

"They fed us too well," the girls reported. "And we could live the entire winter just by taking advantage of all the offers to spend a week on the farm.

In the farmers' homes they talked about politics and the farmers' problems, about [[antisemitism]] and Unionism, about war and peace and social security—"and always," the puppeteers report, "the farmers wanted to know what can be done to create a stronger unity between themselves and city workers. They felt the need of this more strongly than ever before, and the support of the CIO in their milk strike has given them a new understanding and a new respect for the power that lies in solidarity. One summer has convinced us that a minimum of organized effort on the part of city organizations—unions, consumers' bodies, the American Labor Party and similar groups—can not only reach the farmers but weld them into a pretty solid front with city folks that will be one of the best guarantees for progress.&lt;ref&gt;Emery, Lawrence, "Interesting Summer: Young Puppeteers in Unique Tour of Rural Areas," quoted on [https://web.archive.org/web/20060919131726/http://www.peteseeger.net/DW10021939.htm Pete Seeger website]&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

That fall Seeger took a job in Washington, D.C., assisting [[Alan Lomax]], a friend of his father's, at the [[Archive of American Folk Song]] of the [[Library of Congress]]. Seeger's job was to help Lomax sift through commercial "[[African American music|race]]" and "[[Old-time music|hillbilly]]" music and select recordings that best represented American folk music, a project funded by the music division of the Pan American Union (later the [[Organization of American States]]), of whose music division his father, Charles Seeger, was head (1938–53).&lt;ref&gt;The resultant 22-page mimeographed "List of American Folk Music on Commercial Recordings", issued in 1940 and mailed by Lomax out to academic folklore scholars, became the basis of [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith's]] celebrated ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'' on [[Folkways Records]]. Seeger also did similar work for Lomax at [[Decca Records|Decca]] in the late 1940s.&lt;/ref&gt; Lomax also encouraged Seeger's folk singing vocation, and Seeger was soon appearing as a regular performer on Alan Lomax and [[Nicholas Ray]]'s weekly [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting]] show ''Back Where I Come From'' (1940–41) alongside [[Josh White]], [[Burl Ives]], [[Lead Belly]], and [[Woody Guthrie]] (whom he had first met at [[Will Geer]]'s Grapes of Wrath benefit concert for [[migrant workers]] on March 3, 1940). ''Back Where I Come From'' was unique in having a [[Racial integration|racially integrated]] cast, which made news when it performed in March 1941 at a command performance at the [[White House]] organized by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] called "An Evening of Songs for American Soldiers,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,851095,00.html Folk Songs in the White House], ''Time'', March 3, 1941&lt;/ref&gt; before an audience that included the [[U.S. Secretary of War|Secretaries of War]], [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury]], and the [[U.S. Secretary of the Navy|Navy]], among other notables. The show was a success but was not picked up by commercial sponsors for nationwide broadcasting because of its integrated cast. During [[World War II|the war]], Seeger also performed on nationwide radio broadcasts by [[Norman Corwin]].

Mrs. Roosevelt is expected to attend at 8:30 p.m."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1949, Seeger worked as the vocal instructor for the progressive [[City and Country School]] in [[Greenwich Village]], New York.

===Early activism===
In 1936, at the age of 17, Pete Seeger joined the [[Young Communist League, USA|Young Communist League]] (YCL), then at the height of its popularity and influence. In 1942, he became a member of the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) itself but left in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;He later commented "Innocently I became a member of the Communist Party, and when they said fight for peace, I did, and when they said fight Hitler, I did. I got out in '49, though.... I should have left much earlier. It was stupid of me not to. My father had got out in '38, when he read the testimony of the trials in Moscow, and he could tell they were forced confessions. We never talked about it, though, and I didn't examine closely enough what was going on.... I thought Stalin was the brave secretary Stalin, and had no idea how cruel a leader he was." Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer" (2006), p. 52; see also ''The Protest Singer: An Intimate Portrait'' (2009), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1941, the twenty-one-year-old Seeger performed as a member of the [[Almanac Singers]] along with Millard Lampell, [[Cisco Houston]], [[Woody Guthrie]], Butch, and [[Bess Lomax Hawes]], and Lee Hays. Seeger and the Almanacs cut several albums of 78s on Keynote and other labels, ''[[Songs for John Doe]]'' (recorded in late February or March and released in May 1941), the ''[[Talking Union]]'', and an album each of sea chanteys and pioneer songs. Written by Millard Lampell, ''[[Songs for John Doe]]'' was performed by Lampell, Seeger, and Hays, joined by Josh White and Sam Gary. It contained lines such as, "It wouldn't be much thrill to die for Du Pont in Brazil," that were sharply critical of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]'s unprecedented peacetime draft (enacted in September 1940). This anti-war/anti-draft tone reflected the Communist Party line after the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which maintained the war was "phony" and a mere pretext for big American corporations to get Hitler to attack Soviet Russia. Seeger has said he believed this line of argument at the time—as did many fellow members of the Young Communist League (YCL). Though nominally members of the [[Popular Front]], which was allied with Roosevelt and more moderate liberals, the YCL's members still smarted from Roosevelt and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]'s arms embargo to Loyalist Spain (which Roosevelt later called a mistake),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTKvo-cXv3EC&amp;dq=Roosevelt+refusal+to+aid+Loyalist+Spain+mistake&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|first=Robert |last=Dallek
| title="&amp;#39;Franklin D. Roosevelt and American Foreign Policy, 1932–1945"&amp;#39;|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|page=180|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the alliance frayed in the confusing welter of events.

A June 16, 1941, review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, which under its owner, [[Henry Luce]], had become very interventionist, denounced the Almanacs' ''John Doe'', accusing it of scrupulously echoing what it called "the mendacious Moscow tune" that "Franklin Roosevelt is leading an unwilling people into a J. P. Morgan war." Eleanor Roosevelt, a fan of folk music, reportedly found the album "in bad taste," though President Roosevelt, when the album was shown to him, merely observed, correctly as it turned out, that few people would ever hear it. More alarmist was the reaction of eminent German-born Harvard Professor of Government [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]], an adviser on domestic propaganda to the United States military. In a review in the June 1941 ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', entitled "The Poison in Our System," he pronounced ''Songs for John Doe'' "...strictly subversive and illegal," "...whether Communist or Nazi financed," and "a matter for the attorney general," observing further that "mere" legal "suppression" would not be sufficient to counteract this type of populist poison,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peteseeger.net/poison.htm "The Poison in Our System" (excerpt from the ''Atlantic Monthly'') by Carl Joachim Friedrich] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603002452/http://www.peteseeger.net/poison.htm |date=June 3, 2013}}. Note: Dunaway misses the significance of military propagandist Carl Joachim Friedrich, when he mistakenly refers to him as "Karl Frederick," an error other writers who relied on Dunaway repeated.&lt;/ref&gt; the poison being folk music and the ease with which it could be spread.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich's review concluded: "The three records sell for one dollar and you are asked to 'play them in your home, play them in your union hall, take them back to your people.' Probably some of these songs fall under the criminal provisions of the Selective Service Act, and to that extent it is a matter for the Attorney-General. But you never can handle situations of this kind democratically by mere suppression. Unless civic groups and individuals will make a determined effort to counteract such appeals by equally effective methods, democratic morale will decline." Upon United States entry into the war in 1942, Friedrich became chairman of the Executive Committee of the Council for Democracy, charged with combatting isolationism, and had his [http://www.peteseeger.net/poison.htm article on the Almanacs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603002452/http://www.peteseeger.net/poison.htm |date=June 3, 2013 }} reprinted as one of several pamphlets which he sent to radio network executives.&lt;/ref&gt;

At that point, the U.S. had not yet entered the war but was energetically re-arming. African Americans were barred from working in defense plants, a situation that greatly angered both African Americans and white progressives. Civil rights leader [[A. J. Muste]] and Black union leaders [[A. Philip Randolph]] and [[Bayard Rustin]] began planning a huge march on Washington to protest racial discrimination in war industries and to urge desegregation of the armed forces. The march, which many regard as the first manifestation of the Civil Rights Movement, was canceled after President Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 8802]] (The Fair Employment Act) of June 25, 1941, barring discrimination in hiring by companies holding federal contracts for defense work. This Presidential act defused black anger considerably, although the United States Army still refused to desegregate, declining to participate in what it considered social experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;"The Army cannot change civilian ideas on the Negro. The army is not a sociological laboratory. The Army's job is to train soldiers. To address itself to racial problems would be to endanger efficiency and morale," Colonel E.R. Householder speaking to a conference of African-American editors on December 8, 1941, quoted by [[Roy Wilkins]] in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ElsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=the+army+is+not+a+sociological+laboratory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ieTtCOD_DS&amp;sig=1rvq4bu3QrPa13hZmbCK25uttrU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BhXcVKXNHcygNr_9gKAL&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20army%20is%20not%20a%20sociological%20laboratory&amp;f=false "The Old Army Game?" ''The Crisis'' (December, 1945), pp. 130–31.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt's order came three days after Hitler broke the non-aggression pact and invaded the Soviet Union, at which time the Communist Party quickly directed its members to get behind the draft and forbade participation in strikes for the duration of the war (angering some leftists). Copies of ''Songs for John Doe'' were removed from sale, and the remaining inventory destroyed, though a few copies may exist in the hands of private collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Although the Almanacs were accused – both at the time and in subsequent histories – of reversing their attitudes in response to the Communist Party's new party line, "Seeger has pointed out that virtually all progressives reversed course and supported the war. He insists that no one, Communist Party or otherwise, told the Almanacs to change their songs. (Seeger interview with [Richard A.] Reuss 4/9/68)" quoted in William G. Roy, [http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/8/1/2/pages108124/p108124-1.php "Who Shall Not Be Moved? Folk Music, Community and Race in the American The Communist Party and the Highlander School," ff p. 16]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302214224/http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/8/1/2/pages108124/p108124-1.php |date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Almanac Singers' ''Talking Union'' album, on the other hand, was reissued as an LP by [[Folkways Records|Folkways]] (FH 5285A) in 1955 and is still available. The following year, the Almanacs issued ''[[Dear Mr. President (Almanac Singers album)|Dear Mr. President]]'', an album in support of Roosevelt and the war effort. The title song, "Dear Mr. President", was a solo by Pete Seeger, and its lines expressed his lifelong credo:

{{quote|Now, Mr. President, / We haven't always agreed in the past, I know, / But that ain't at all important now. / What is important is what we got to do, / We got to lick Mr. Hitler, and until we do, / Other things can wait.//

Now, as I think of our great land . . . / I know it ain't perfect, but it will be someday, / Just give us a little time. // This is the reason that I want to fight, / Not 'cause everything's perfect, or everything's right. / No, it's just the opposite: I'm fightin' because / I want a better America, and better laws, / And better homes, and jobs, and schools, / And no more Jim Crow, and no more rules like / "You can't ride on this train 'cause you're a Negro," / "You can't live here 'cause you're a Jew,"/ "You can't work here 'cause you're a union man."//

So, Mr. President, / We got this one big job to do / That's lick Mr. Hitler and when we're through, / Let no one else ever take his place / To trample down the human race. / So what I want is you to give me a gun / So we can hurry up and get the job done.}}

Seeger's critics, however, continued to bring up the Almanacs' repudiated ''Songs for John Doe''. In 1942, a year after the ''John Doe'' album's brief appearance (and disappearance), the FBI decided that the now-pro-war Almanacs were still endangering the war effort by subverting recruitment. According to the New York ''World Telegram'' (February 14, 1942), Carl Friedrich's 1941 article "The Poison in Our System" was printed up as a pamphlet and distributed by the Council for Democracy (an organization that Friedrich and [[Henry Luce]]'s right-hand man, [[C. D. Jackson]], Vice President of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, had founded "...to combat all the nazi, fascist, communist, pacifist..." antiwar groups in the United States).&lt;ref&gt;Blanche Wiessen Cook, ''Eisenhower Declassified'' (Doubleday, 1981), page 122. "The Council was a limited affair," Cook writes, "...that served mostly to highlight Jackson's talents as a propagandist."&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeger served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific]]. He was trained as an airplane mechanic but was reassigned to entertain the American troops with music. Later, when people asked him what he did in the war, he always answered: "I strummed my banjo." After returning from service, Seeger and others established [[People's Songs]], conceived as a nationwide organization with branches on both coasts and designed to "Create, promote and distribute songs of labor and the American People"&lt;ref&gt;People's Songs Inc. People's Songs Newsletter No 1. February 1946. [[Old Town School of Folk Music]] Resource center collection.&lt;/ref&gt; With Pete Seeger as its director, People's Songs worked for the 1948 presidential campaign of Roosevelt's former Secretary of Agriculture and Vice President, [[Henry A. Wallace]], who ran as a third-party candidate on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] ticket. Despite having attracted enormous crowds nationwide, however, Wallace won only in New York City and following the election he was excoriated for accepting the help in his campaign of Communists and fellow travelers such as Seeger and singer [[Paul Robeson]].&lt;ref&gt;American Masters: "Pete Seeger: The Power of Song – [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] Broadcast 2-27-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish Civil War songs===
Seeger had been a fervent supporter of the Republican forces in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1943, with [[Tom Glazer]] and Bess and Baldwin Hawes, he recorded an album of 78s called ''[[Songs of the Lincoln Battalion]]'' on Moe Asch's Stinson label. This included such songs as "[[There's a Valley in Spain called Jarama]]" and "[[¡Ay Carmela! (song)|Viva la Quince Brigada]]". In 1960, this collection was re-issued by Moe Asch as one side of a Folkways LP called ''Songs of the Lincoln and International Brigades''. On the other side was a reissue of the legendary ''Six Songs for Democracy'' (originally recorded in Barcelona in 1938 while bombs were falling), performed by [[Ernst Busch (actor)|Ernst Busch]] and a chorus of members of the [[Thälmann Battalion]], made up of volunteers from Nazi Germany. The songs were: "Moorsoldaten" ([[Peat Bog Soldiers (song)|"Peat Bog Soldiers"]], composed by political prisoners of German concentration camps); "[[Freiheit (song)|Die Thaelmann-Kolonne]]", "Hans Beimler", "Das Lied Von Der Einheitsfront" ("Song of The United Front" by [[Hanns Eisler]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]]), "Der Internationalen Brigaden" ("Song of the International Brigades"), and "Los cuatro generales" ("The Four Generals", known in English as "The Four Insurgent Generals").

===Group recordings===
As a self-described "split tenor" (between an alto and a tenor),&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer" (2006), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Seeger was a founding member of two highly influential folk groups: the [[Almanac Singers]] and [[the Weavers]]. The Almanac Singers, which Seeger co-founded in 1941 with [[Millard Lampell]] and Arkansas singer and activist [[Lee Hays]], was a topical group, designed to function as a singing newspaper promoting the industrial unionization movement,&lt;ref&gt;See Wikipedia entry on the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]].&lt;/ref&gt; racial and religious inclusion, and other progressive causes. Its personnel included, at various times: Woody Guthrie, [[Bess Lomax Hawes]], [[Sis Cunningham]], [[Josh White]], and [[Sam Gary]]. As a controversial Almanac singer, the 21-year-old Seeger performed under the stage name "Pete Bowers" to avoid compromising his father's government career.

In 1950, the Almanacs were reconstituted as the Weavers, named after the title of an 1892 play by [[Gerhart Hauptmann]] about a workers' strike (which contained the lines, "We'll stand it no more, come what may!"). They did benefits for strikers at which they sang songs such as 'Talking Union', about the struggles for unionisation of industrial workers such as miners and auto mobile workers.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, David. "The Jukebox in the Garden: Ecocriticism and American Popular Music Since 1960." ''Humanities Source''. 2010 Vol. 7. Retrieved October 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Pete Seeger (performing under his own name), members of the Weavers included charter Almanac member Lee Hays, [[Ronnie Gilbert]], and [[Fred Hellerman]]; later [[Frank Hamilton (musician)|Frank Hamilton]], [[Erik Darling]], and [[Bernie Krause]] serially took Seeger's place. In the atmosphere of the 1950s red scare, the Weavers' repertoire had to be less overtly topical than that of the Almanacs had been, and its progressive message was couched in indirect language—arguably rendering it even more powerful. The Weavers on occasion performed in tuxedos (unlike the Almanacs, who had dressed informally) and their managers refused to let them perform at political venues. The Weavers' string of major [[Chart-topper|hit]]s began with "[[On Top of Old Smoky]]" and an arrangement of [[Lead Belly]]'s signature waltz, "[[Goodnight, Irene]]",&lt;ref name=pc1&gt;{{Pop Chronicles|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950&lt;ref&gt;Alec Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer: Pete Seeger and American folk music," in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (April 17, 2006), pp. 44–53.&lt;/ref&gt; and was covered by many other pop singers. On the flip side of "Irene" was the Israeli song "[[Tzena, Tzena, Tzena]]".&lt;ref name=pc1/&gt; Other Weaver hits included [[Woody Guthrie discography#1940, RCA Victor Sessions, Dust Bowl Ballads|"Dusty Old Dust" ("So Long It's Been Good to Know You" by Woody Guthrie)]], "[[Kisses Sweeter than Wine (song)|Kisses Sweeter Than Wine]]" (by Hays, Seeger, and Lead Belly), and the South African Zulu song by Solomon Linda, "[[Wimoweh]]" (about [[Shaka]]), among others.

The Weavers' performing career was abruptly derailed in 1953 at the peak of their popularity when blacklisting prompted radio stations to refuse to play their records and all their bookings were canceled. They briefly returned to the stage, however, at a sold-out reunion at Carnegie Hall in 1955 and in a subsequent [[reunion tour]], which produced a hit version of [[Merle Travis]]'s "[[Sixteen Tons]]" as well as LPs of their concert performances. "[[Kumbaya]]", a [[Gullah]] black spiritual dating from slavery days, was also introduced to wide audiences by Pete Seeger and the Weavers (in 1959), becoming a staple of Boy and Girl Scout campfires.

In the late 1950s, [[the Kingston Trio]] was formed in direct imitation of (and homage to) the Weavers, covering much of the latter's repertoire, though with a more buttoned-down, uncontroversial, and mainstream collegiate persona. The Kingston Trio produced another phenomenal succession of Billboard chart hits and in its turn spawned a legion of imitators, laying the groundwork for the 1960s commercial folk revival.

In the documentary film ''[[Pete Seeger: The Power of Song]]'' (2007), Seeger states that he resigned from the Weavers when the three other band members agreed to perform a [[jingle]] for a [[Tobacco advertising|cigarette commercial]].

===Banjo and 12-string guitar===
In 1948, Seeger wrote the first version of his now-classic ''How to Play the Five-String Banjo'', a book that many [[banjo]] players credit with starting them off on the [[musical instrument|instrument]]. He went on to invent the ''Long Neck'' or ''Seeger'' banjo. This instrument is three frets longer than a typical banjo, is slightly longer than a bass guitar at 25 frets, and is tuned a minor third lower than the normal 5-string banjo. Hitherto strictly limited to the Appalachian region, the five-string banjo became known nationwide as the American folk instrument par excellence, largely thanks to Seeger's championing of and improvements to it. According to an unnamed musician quoted in [[David King Dunaway]]'s biography, "by nesting a resonant chord between two precise notes, a melody note and a chiming note on the fifth string", Pete Seeger "gentrified" the more percussive traditional [[Appalachia]]n "frailing" style, "with its vigorous hammering of the forearm and its percussive rapping of the fingernail on the banjo head."&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Although what Dunaway's informant describes is the age-old droned frailing style, the implication is that Seeger made this more acceptable to mass audiences by omitting some of its percussive complexities, while presumably still preserving the characteristic driving rhythmic quality associated with the style.

From the late 1950s on, Seeger also accompanied himself on the [[12-string guitar]], an instrument of Mexican origin that had been associated with [[Lead Belly]], who had styled himself "the King of the 12-String Guitar". Seeger's distinctive custom-made guitars had a triangular soundhole. He combined the long scale length (approximately 28") and [[capo|capo-to-key]] techniques that he favored on the banjo with a variant of [[Drop D tuning|drop-D (DADGBE) tuning]], tuned two whole steps down with very heavy strings, which he played with thumb and finger picks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag115/gear115.html |title=Acoustic Guitar Central |publisher=Acousticguitar.com |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913142102/http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag115/gear115.html |archivedate=September 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of the "Steel Pan" to U.S. audiences===
In 1956, then "Peter" Seeger (see film credits) and his wife, Toshi, traveled to Port of Spain, [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]], to seek out information on the [[steelpan]], steel drum or "Ping-Pong" as it was sometimes called. The two searched out a local panyard director Isaiah and proceeded to film the construction, tuning and playing of the then new, national instrument of Trinidad-Tobago. He was attempting to include the unique flavor of the steel pan into American Folk music.

===The McCarthy era===
[[File:Pete Seeger NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|1955]]In the 1950s and, indeed, consistently throughout his life, Seeger continued his support of civil and labor rights, racial equality, international understanding, and anti-militarism (all of which had characterized the Wallace campaign) and he continued to believe that songs could help people achieve these goals. With the ever-growing revelations of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s atrocities and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, however, he became increasingly disillusioned with Soviet Communism. He left the CPUSA in 1949 but remained friends with some who did not leave it, though he argued with them about it.&lt;ref name="powersong"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/seeger_p.html "Pete Seeger: The Power of Song"] – PBS American Masters, February 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/seeger_interview/index.html, Pete Seeger Interview] PBS American Masters.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 1955, Seeger was subpoenaed to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). Alone among the many witnesses after the 1950 conviction and imprisonment of the [[Hollywood Ten]] for contempt of Congress, Seeger refused to plead the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] (which would have asserted that his testimony might be self incriminating) and instead, as the Hollywood Ten had done, refused to name personal and political associations on the grounds that this would violate his [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights: "I am not going to answer any questions as to my association, my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs, or how I voted in any election, or any of these private affairs. I think these are very improper questions for any American to be asked, especially under such compulsion as this."&lt;ref&gt;Pete Seeger to the House Un-American Activities Committee, August 18, 1955. Quoted, along with some other exchanges from that hearing, in Wilkinson, "The Protest Singer" (2006), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He was convicted in a jury trial of contempt of Congress in March 1961, and sentenced to ten 1-year terms in jail (to be served simultaneously), but in May 1962, an appeals court ruled the indictment to be flawed and overturned his conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12619416914263979951 ''United States v.

In 1960, the [[San Diego]] school board told him that he could not play a scheduled concert at a high school unless he signed an oath pledging that the concert would not be used to promote a communist agenda or an overthrow of the government. Seeger refused, and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] obtained an [[injunction]] against the school district, allowing the concert to go on as scheduled. Almost 50 years later, in February 2009, the San Diego School District officially extended an apology to Seeger for the actions of their predecessors.&lt;ref name=SignOnSD&gt;{{cite web|last=Dillon|first=Raquel Maria|title=School board offers apology to singer Pete Seeger|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2009/feb/11/pete-seeger-apology-021109/?zIndex=51324|work=Sign on San Diego|accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk music revival===
To earn money during the blacklist period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, Seeger worked gigs as a music teacher in schools and summer camps, and traveled the college campus circuit. He also recorded as many as five albums a year for [[Moe Asch]]'s [[Folkways Records]] label. As the nuclear disarmament movement picked up steam in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Seeger's anti-war songs, such as, "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]" (co-written with [[Joe Hickerson]]), "[[Turn! Turn! Turn! (song)|Turn! Turn! Turn!]]",&lt;ref name=pc33&gt;{{Pop Chronicles |33}}&lt;/ref&gt; adapted from the [[Book of Ecclesiastes]], and "[[The Bells of Rhymney]]" by the Welsh poet [[Idris Davies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/caerphilly/pages/bellsofrhymney.shtml |title=BBC News – South East Wales |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1957), gained wide currency. Seeger also was closely associated with the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and in 1963 helped organize a landmark [[Carnegie Hall]] concert, featuring the youthful [[Freedom Singers]], as a benefit for the [[Highlander Folk School]] in Tennessee. This event and [[Martin Luther King]]'s [[March on Washington]] in August of that year brought the Civil Rights anthem "[[We Shall Overcome]]" to wide audiences where he sang it on the 50-mile walk from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. along with 1,000 other marchers.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, John. "Pete Seeger: Changing The World One Song At A Time." ''Waxahachie Daily Light''. May 30, 2013. Rutherford Institute. Accessed on October 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
By this time, Seeger was a senior figure in the 1960s folk revival centered in [[Greenwich Village]], as a longtime columnist in ''[[Sing Out!]]'', the successor to the People's Songs ''Bulletin'', and as a founder of the topical [[Broadside Magazine|''Broadside'']] magazine. To describe the new crop of politically committed folk singers, he coined the phrase "Woody's children", alluding to his associate and traveling companion, Woody Guthrie, who by this time had become a legendary figure. This urban folk-revival movement, a continuation of the activist tradition of the 1930s and 1940s and of [[People's Songs]], used adaptations of traditional tunes and lyrics to effect social change, a practice that goes back to the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] or Wobblies' ''Little Red Song Book'', compiled by Swedish-born union organizer [[Joe Hill]] (1879–1915). (The ''Little Red Song Book'' had been a favorite of Woody Guthrie's, who was known to carry it around.){{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Seeger toured Australia in 1963. His single "[[Little Boxes]]", written by Malvina Reynolds, was number one in the nation's Top 40s. That tour sparked a folk boom throughout the country at a time when popular music tastes, post-[[Assassination of JFK|Kennedy assassination]], competed between folk, the [[Surf music|surfing craze]], and the British rock boom which gave the world [[the Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], among others. Folk clubs sprung up all over the nation, folk performers were accepted in established venues, and Australian performers singing Australian folk songs – many of their own composing – emerged in concerts and festivals, on television, and on recordings, and overseas performers were encouraged to tour Australia.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The long television blacklist of Seeger began to end in the mid-1960s, when he hosted a regionally broadcast, educational, folk-music television show, ''[[Rainbow Quest]]''. Among his guests were [[Johnny Cash]], [[June Carter]], [[Reverend Gary Davis]], [[Mississippi John Hurt]], [[Doc Watson]], [[the Stanley Brothers]], [[Elizabeth Cotten]], [[Patrick Sky]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Hedy West]], [[Donovan]], [[The Clancy Brothers]], [[Richard Fariña]] and [[Mimi Fariña]], [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Brownie McGhee]], Mamou Cajun Band, [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]], The Beers Family, [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Malvina Reynolds]], Sonia Malkine, and [[Shawn Phillips]]. Thirty-nine&lt;ref name="powersong"/&gt; hour-long programs were recorded at [[WNJU]]'s [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] studios in 1965 and 1966, produced by Seeger and his wife Toshi, with Sholom Rubinstein. The [[Smothers Brothers]] ended Seeger's national blacklisting by broadcasting him singing "[[Waist Deep in the Big Muddy]]" on their CBS variety show on February 25, 1968, after his similar performance in September 1967 was censored by CBS.&lt;ref&gt;''Dangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'', by David Bianculli, Touchstone, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1976, Seeger wrote and recorded the anti-death penalty song "Delbert Tibbs", about the [[Delbert Tibbs|eponymous death-row inmate]], who was later [[exonerated]]. Seeger wrote the music and selected the words from poems written by Tibbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peteseeger.net/songwriter_magazine.htm |title=Songwriter – Pete Seeger and Writing For Freedom |publisher=Peteseeger.net |date=July 28, 1976 |accessdate=September 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912091020/http://www.peteseeger.net/songwriter_magazine.htm |archivedate=September 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeger also supported the Jewish Camping Movement. He came to [[Surprise Lake Camp]] in [[Cold Spring, New York]], over the summer many times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turton|first=Michael|title=Surprise Lake Camp: Rich History, Big Presence|url=http://philipstown.info/2011/08/14/surprise-lake-camp-rich-history-big-presence/|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Philipstown.info|date=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sang and inspired countless campers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bank|first=Justin|title=Pete Seeger, Neil Diamond and me|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/01/28/pete-seeger-neil-diamond-and-me/?wp_login_redirect=0|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=January 28, 2014|date=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pete Seeger and Bob Dylan====
Pete Seeger was one of the earliest backers of [[Bob Dylan]] and was responsible for urging A&amp;R man [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] to produce Dylan's first LP on [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], and for inviting him to perform at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], of which Seeger was a board member.&lt;ref&gt;Fellow Newport Board member [[Bruce Jackson (scholar)|Bruce Jackson]] writes, "Pete Seeger, more than any of the other board members, had a personal connection with Bob Dylan: it was he who [in 1962] had convinced the great Columbia A and R man John Hammond, famous for his work with jazz and blues musicians, to produce Dylan's eponymous first album, ''Bob Dylan''. If anyone was responsible for Bob Dylan's presence on the Newport Stage [in 1965], it was Pete Seeger". See Bruce Jackson, ''The Story Is True: The Art and Meaning of Telling Stories'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2008), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a widely repeated story that Seeger was so upset over the extremely loud amplified sound that Dylan, backed by members of the [[Paul Butterfield|Butterfield Blues Band]], brought into the 1965 [[Newport Folk Festival]] that he threatened to disconnect the equipment. There are multiple versions of what went on, some fanciful. What is certain is that tensions had been running high between Dylan's manager [[Albert Grossman]] and Festival Board members (who besides Seeger also included [[Theodore Bikel]], [[Bruce Jackson (scholar)|Bruce Jackson]], [[Alan Lomax]], festival MC [[Peter Yarrow]], and [[George Wein]]) over the scheduling of performers and other matters. Two days earlier, there had been a scuffle and brief exchange of blows between Grossman and Alan Lomax, and the Board in an emergency session had voted to ban Grossman from the grounds but had backed off when George Wein pointed out that Grossman also managed highly popular draws [[Odetta]] and [[Peter, Paul and Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Szwed]], ''Alan Lomax, 'The Man Who Recorded the World'' (Viking, 2010), p. 354. The Butterfield Blues Band, a new, integrated Chicago-based electric band, was the closer in an afternoon blues workshop entitled "Blues: Origins and Offshoots", hosted by Lomax, that had included African-American blues greats [[Willie Dixon]], [[Son House]], [[Memphis Slim]], and a prison work group from Texas, along with bluegrass pioneer [[Bill Monroe]] and the Bluegrass Boys. Lomax, upset that Butterfield's group had been shoehorned into his workshop, reportedly complained aloud about how long they took to set up their electrical equipment and introduced them with the words, "Now, let's find out if these guys can play at all." This infuriated Grossman (who was angling to manage the new group), and he responded by attacking Lomax physically. [[Mike Bloomfield|Michael Bloomfield]] stated, "Alan Lomax, the great folklorist and musicologist, gave us some kind of introduction that I didn't even hear, but Albert found it offensive. And Albert went upside his head. The next thing we knew, right in the middle of our show, Lomax and Grossman were kicking ass on the floor in the middle of thousands of people at the Newport Folk Festival. Tearing each other's clothes off. We had to pull 'em apart. We figured 'Albert, man, now there's a manager!{{'"}} quoted in Jan Mark Wolkin, Bill Keenom, and Carlos Santana's, ''Michael Bloomfield: If You Love These Blues'' (San Francisco: Miller Freeman Books), p. 102. See also Ronald D. Cohen's introduction to "Part III, The Folk Revival (1960s)" in ''Alan Lomax: Selected Writings'', Ronald D. Cohen, ed. (London: Routledege), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeger has been portrayed as a folk "purist" who was one of the main opponents to Dylan's [[Electric Dylan controversy|"going electric"]].&lt;ref&gt;Rock critic [[Greil Marcus]] wrote: "Backstage, Peter Seeger and the great ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax attempted to cut the band's power cables with an axe." See Greil Marcus, ''Invisible Republic, the Story of the Basement Tapes'' [1998], republished in paperback as ''The Old, Weird America: The World of Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes'' (New York: Holt, 2001), p. 12. Marcus's apocryphal story was elaborated by [[Maria Muldaur]] and [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]] in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s film ''No Direction Home'' (2005),&lt;/ref&gt; but when asked in 2001 about how he recalled his "objections" to the electric style, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I couldn't understand the words. I wanted to hear the words. It was a great song, "[[Maggie's Farm]]," and the sound was distorted. I ran over to the guy at the controls and shouted, "Fix the sound so you can hear the words." He hollered back, "This is the way they want it." I said "Damn it, if I had an axe, I'd cut the cable right now." But I was at fault. I was the MC, and I could have said to the part of the crowd that booed Bob, "you didn't boo [[Howlin' Wolf]] yesterday. He was electric!" Though I still prefer to hear Dylan acoustic, some of his electric songs are absolutely great. Electric music is the vernacular of the second half of the twentieth century, to use my father's old term.&lt;ref&gt;David Kupfer, [http://www.wholeearthmag.com/ArticleBin/406.html Longtime Passing: An interview with Pete Seeger], ''Whole Earth'' magazine, Spring 2001.

===Vietnam War era and beyond===
[[File:Pete Seeger Stern Grove.jpg|thumb|Pete Seeger, Stern Grove, San Francisco CA  8/6/78]]
A longstanding opponent of the arms race and of the Vietnam War, Seeger [[satire|satirically]] attacked then-President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] with his 1966 recording, on the album ''[[Dangerous Songs!?]]'', of [[Len Chandler]]'s children's song, ''"[[Beans in My Ears]]"''. Beyond Chandler's lyrics, Seeger said that "Mrs. Jay's little son Alby" had "beans in his ears," which, as the lyrics imply,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sniff.numachi.com/pages/tiBEANEARS.html |title=Beans in My Ears |publisher=Sniff.numachi.com |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ensures that a person does not hear what is said to them. To those opposed to continuing the [[Vietnam War]], the phrase implied that "Alby Jay", a loose pronunciation of Johnson's nickname "LBJ," did not listen to anti-war protests as he too had "beans in his ears".

During 1966, Seeger and [[Malvina Reynolds]] took part in environmental activism. The album ''[[God Bless the Grass]]'' was released on January of that year and became the first album in history wholly dedicated to songs about environmental issues. Their politics were informed by the same ideologies of nationalism, populism, and criticism of big business.&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, David (2008). 'My Dirty Stream : Pete Seeger, American Folk Music, and Environmental Protest', ''Popular Music'' Vol. 31, pp22. Routeledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group. October 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeger attracted wider attention starting in 1967 with his song "[[Waist Deep in the Big Muddy]]", about a [[Captain (land)|captain]]—referred to in the lyrics as "the big fool"—who drowned while leading a platoon on maneuvers in [[Louisiana]] during World War II. With its lyrics about a platoon being led into danger by an ignorant captain, the song's anti-war message was obvious- the line "the big fool said to push on" is repeated several times.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Megan. "Songs of Peace and Protest: 6 Essential Cuts From Pete Seeger." ''Time.com'', January 28, 2014. p.1 Business Source Complete. October 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of arguments with the management of [[CBS]] about whether the song's political weight was in keeping with the usually light-hearted entertainment of the ''[[Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', the final lines were "Every time I read the paper/those old feelings come on/We are waist deep in the Big Muddy and the big fool says to push on." The lyrics could be interpreted as an allegory of Johnson as the "big fool" and the [[Vietnam War]] as the foreseeable danger. Although the performance was cut from the September 1967 show,&lt;ref&gt;''Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'', CBS, Season 2, Episode 1, September 10, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; after wide publicity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peteseeger.net/givepeacechance.htm |title=How "Waist Deep in the Big Muddy" Finally Got on Network Television in 1968 |publisher=Peteseeger.net |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805061813/http://www.peteseeger.net/givepeacechance.htm |archivedate=August 5, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was broadcast when Seeger appeared again on the Smothers' Brothers show in the following January.&lt;ref&gt;''Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'', CBS, Season 2, Episode 24, February 25, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the November 15, 1969,&lt;!-- November is correct; incorrect October date widely quoted on web -pls do not change --&gt; [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Vietnam Moratorium March]] on Washington, DC, Seeger led 500,000 protesters in singing [[John Lennon]]'s song "[[Give Peace a Chance]]" as they rallied across from the White House. Seeger's voice carried over the crowd, interspersing phrases like, "Are you listening, [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]?" between the [[refrain|chorus]]es of protesters singing, "All we are saying ... is give peace a chance".&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/vietnam/series/pt_09.html this PBS documentary] and this {{YouTube|ZUn-EGsNt58|recording}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by Woody Guthrie, whose guitar was labeled "This machine kills fascists"&lt;sup&gt;[[:Image:Woody Guthrie.jpg|photo]]&lt;/sup&gt; Seeger's banjo was emblazoned with the motto "This Machine Surrounds Hate and Forces It to Surrender."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/guano/114357902/in/photostream/ |title=Pete Seeger's banjo |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the documentary film ''The Power of Song'', Seeger mentions that he and his family visited North Vietnam in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|people=Brown, Jim (Director)|title=The Power of Song|medium=DVD|publisher=Genius Products LLC|date=2005|isbn=1-59445-156-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a supporter of progressive labor unions, Seeger had supported [[Edward Sadlowski|Ed Sadlowski]] in his bid for the presidency of the [[United Steelworkers of America]]. In 1977, Seeger appeared at a fundraiser in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]]. In 1978, Seeger joined American folk, blues, and jazz singer [[Barbara Dane]] at a rally in New York for striking coal miners.&lt;ref&gt;The Pete Seeger Reader edited by Ronald D. Cohen, James Capaldi [https://books.google.com/books?id=6QAuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=Pete+Seeger+Barbara+Dane&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Li0Jgd9y_R&amp;sig=NrG6OqLDi_nJLbceWCyEfFTe_-o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QCkBVPXkCtGNuAT_0IKwBA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Pete%20Seeger%20Barbara%20Dane&amp;f=false] Page. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Pete Seeger performed in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The performance was later released by Smithsonian Folkways as the album "Singalong Sanders Theater, 1980".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://folkways.si.edu/pete-seeger/singalong-sanders-theater-1980/american-folk-struggle-protest/music/album/smithsonian|title=Singalong Sanders Theater, 1980|website=Smithsonian Folkways Recordings|accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution of the Hudson River===
The most discussed pollution of the Hudson River is [[General Electric]]'s contamination of the river with [[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) between 1947 and 1977.&lt;ref name="epa_ge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hudson River PCBs — Background and Site Information |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |url=http://www.epa.gov/hudson/background.htm |accessdate=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who eat fish from the river or drink the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Priorities List Fact Sheets: Hudson River PCBs |publisher=EPA |url=http://www.epa.gov/Region2/superfund/npl/0202229c.pdf |accessdate=2007-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201054957/http://www.epa.gov/Region2/superfund/npl/0202229c.pdf |archivedate=December 1, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this contamination, activists protested in various ways. Musician Pete Seeger founded the [[Hudson River Sloop Clearwater]] and the [[Clearwater Festival]] to draw attention to the problem. The activism led to the site being designated as one of the [[superfund]] sites.&lt;ref name=upi.com&gt;{{cite news|first=Gerry|last=Harrington|title=Movement afoot to name bridge after Pete Seeger |url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2014/01/31/Movement-afoot-to-name-bridge-after-Pete-Seeger/UPI-15581391204873/ |work=[[United Press International]] |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reflection on support for Soviet Communism===
In 1982, Seeger performed at a benefit concert for [[August 31, 1982 demonstrations in Poland|Poland's Solidarity resistance movement]]. His biographer [[David King Dunaway|David Dunaway]] considers this the first public manifestation of Seeger's decades-long personal dislike of communism in its Soviet form.&lt;ref name="dunawayp103"&gt;David King Dunaway (2008), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s Seeger also expressed disapproval of violent revolutions, remarking to an interviewer that he was really in favor of incremental change and that "the most lasting revolutions are those that take place over a period of time."&lt;ref name="dunawayp103"/&gt; In his autobiography ''Where Have All the Flowers Gone'' (1993, 1997, reissued in 2009), Seeger wrote, "Should I apologize for all this? I think so." He went on to put his thinking in context:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How could [[Hitler]] have been stopped? [[Maxim Litvinov|Litvinov]], the Soviet delegate to the [[League of Nations]] in '36, proposed a worldwide quarantine but got no takers. For more on those times check out pacifist [[Dave Dellinger]]'s book, ''From Yale to Jail&amp;nbsp;...''&lt;ref&gt;David T. Dellinger, ''From Yale to Jail: The Life Story of a Moral Dissenter'' (New York: Pantheon Books, 1993 {{ISBN|0-679-40591-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt; At any rate, today I'll apologize for a number of things, such as thinking that Stalin was merely a "hard driver" and not a "supremely cruel misleader." I guess anyone who calls himself a Christian should be prepared to apologize for the [[Inquisition]], the burning of heretics by Protestants, the slaughter of Jews and Muslims by [[Crusades|Crusaders]]. White people in the U.S.A. ought to apologize for [[Indian removal|stealing land from Native Americans]] and [[Slavery in the United States|enslaving blacks]]. Europeans could apologize for worldwide conquests, Mongolians for [[Genghis Khan]]. And supporters of [[Franklin D.

In a 1995 interview, however, he insisted that "I still call myself a communist, because communism is no more what Russia made of it than Christianity is what the churches make of it."&lt;ref name="The Old Left"&gt;{{cite news | title = The Old Left | work = New York Times Magazine | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7D7123BF931A15752C0A963958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/S/Seeger,%20Pete | date = January 22, 1995 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years, as the aging Seeger began to garner awards and recognition for his lifelong activism, he also found himself criticized once again for his opinions and associations of the 1930s and 1940s. In 2006, [[David Boaz]]—[[Voice of America]] and [[NPR]] commentator and president of the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Cato Institute]]—wrote an opinion piece in ''[[The Guardian]]'', entitled "Stalin's Songbird" in which he excoriated ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' for lauding Seeger. He characterized Seeger as "someone with a longtime habit of following the party line" who had only "eventually" parted ways with the CPUSA. In support of this view, he quoted lines from the [[Almanac Singers]]' May 1941 ''Songs for John Doe'', contrasting them darkly with lines supporting the war from ''Dear Mr. President'', issued in 1942, after the United States and the Soviet Union had entered the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/apr/14/post33?commentpage=1|title=Stalin's songbird|accessdate=March 27, 2009|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | location=London | first=David | last=Boaz | date=April 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boaz's article is reprinted in his book, ''The Politics of Freedom'' (Washington, D.C.: The Cato Institute, 2008) pp. 283–84&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, in response to criticism from a historian [[Ronald Radosh|Ron Radosh]], a former [[Trotskyite]] who now writes for the conservative ''[[National Review]]''—Seeger wrote a song condemning Stalin, "Big Joe Blues":&lt;ref&gt;Dunaway, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'', p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm singing about old Joe, cruel Joe. / He ruled with an iron hand. /He put an end to the dreams / Of so many in every land. / He had a chance to make / A brand new start for the human race. / Instead he set it back / Right in the same nasty place. / I got the Big Joe Blues. / Keep your mouth shut or you will die fast. / I got the Big Joe Blues. / Do this job, no questions asked. / I got the Big Joe Blues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2007/09/joe-blues-folk-music-seeger Seeger turns on Uncle Joe], NewStatesMan, September 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The song was accompanied by a letter to Radosh, in which Seeger stated, "I think you're right, I should have asked to see the [[gulag]]s when I was in U.S.S.R [in 1965]."&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;Daniel J.

On March 16, 2007, Pete Seeger, his sister [[Peggy Seeger|Peggy]], his brothers [[Mike Seeger|Mike]] and John, his wife Toshi, and other family members spoke and performed at a symposium and concert sponsored by the [[American Folklife Center]] in honor of the [[Seeger family]], held at the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/folklife/Seegersymposium/ "How Can I Keep from Singing?": A Seeger Family Tribute]. 2007 symposium and concert, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress (web presentation includes program, photographs, and webcasts).&lt;/ref&gt; where Pete Seeger had been employed by the Archive of American Folk Song 67 years earlier.

In September 2008, [[Appleseed Recordings]] released ''At 89'', Seeger's first studio album in 12 years. On September 29, 2008, the 89-year-old singer-activist, once banned from commercial TV, made a rare national TV appearance on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', singing "Take It From Dr. King".

On January 18, 2009, Seeger and his grandson [[Tao Rodríguez-Seeger]] joined [[Bruce Springsteen]], and the crowd in singing the Woody Guthrie song "[[This Land Is Your Land]]" in the finale of Barack Obama's Inaugural concert in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=Tuscaloosa&gt;Tommy Stevenson, [http://www.truth-out.org/archive/item/82100:this-land-is-your-land-like-woody-wrote-it "'This Land Is Your Land' Like Woody Wrote It"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220194941/http://www.truth-out.org/archive/item/82100:this-land-is-your-land-like-woody-wrote-it |date=February 20, 2014 }}, ''Truthout'', January 19, 2009.

Over the years, he lent his fame to support numerous environmental organizations, including South Jersey's Bayshore Center, the home of New Jersey's tall ship, the oyster schooner A.J. Meerwald.

On September 19, 2009, Seeger made his first appearance at the 52nd Monterey Jazz Festival, which was particularly notable because the festival does not normally feature folk artists.

In 2010, still active at the age of 91, Seeger co-wrote and performed the song ''[[God's Counting on Me, God's Counting on You]]'' with Lorre Wyatt, commenting on the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Doyle, [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/17386/184956 Video: Pete Seeger Debuts New BP Protest Song: Songwriter talks inspiration behind "God's Counting on Me, God's Counting on You"], ''Rolling Stone'' online, July 26, 2010.

===Death===

Seeger died at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on January 27, 2014, at the age of 94.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/arts/music/pete-seeger-songwriter-and-champion-of-folk-music-dies-at-94.html?_r=0] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714022101/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/arts/music/pete-seeger-songwriter-and-champion-of-folk-music-dies-at-94.html?_r=0 |date=July 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Response and reaction to Seeger's death quickly poured in. President [[Barack Obama]] noted that Seeger had been called "America's tuning fork"&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "America's tuning fork" is usually attributed to poet [[Carl Sandburg]], for example, see Corey Sandler, ''Henry Hudson: Dreams and Obsessions'' (New York: Kensington Books, 2007), p. 203. It is unclear when and where Sandburg, who thought highly of the Weavers, said this. Studs Terkel, who introduced Seeger as "America's tuning fork" at the 1959 Newport Folk Festival (see George Wein, Nate Chinen, ''Myself Among Others: A Life in Music'' [Da Capo Press, 2009], p. 314), later wrote that he had seen the phase in ''[[Down Beat]]'' jazz magazine (see Terkel, ''Hope Dies Last: Keeping The Faith In Troubled Times'' [New York: The New Press], p. 249). The phrase was picked up in a [https://books.google.com/books?id=NEgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=Pete+Seeger+America%27s+tuning+fork&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vgNYU9ekFOTKsQS65IGoDw&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pete%20Seeger%20America's%20tuning%20fork&amp;f=false photo spread on Seeger] by [[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]] (October 9, 1964), p. 61 (see also Ronald D. Cohen, ''Rainbow Quest: The Folk Music Revival and American Society, 1940–70'' [University of Massachusetts Press, 1970], p. 223).&lt;/ref&gt; and that he believed in "the power of song" to bring social change, "Over the years, Pete used his voice and his hammer to strike blows for workers' rights and civil rights; world peace and environmental conservation, and he always invited us to sing along. For reminding us where we come from and showing us where we need to go, we will always be grateful to Pete Seeger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama memorializes Pete Seeger|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2014/01/28/obama-pete-seeger-bruce-springsteen/4958941/|work=USA Today|accessdate=January 28, 2014|date=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folksinger and fellow activist [[Billy Bragg]] wrote that: "Pete believed that music could make a difference.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3836">'''Post-romanticism''' or '''Postromanticism''' refers to a range of cultural endeavors and attitudes emerging in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, after the period of [[Romanticism]].

[[Herman Melville]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]] are post-Romantic writers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Milder, ''Exiled Royalties: Melville and the Life We Imagine'', New York: Oxford University Press US, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;41. {{ISBN|0-19-514232-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flaubert]]'s ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' is a post-Romantic novel.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Heath, ''Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary'', Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;13. {{ISBN|0-521-31483-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The period of post-romanticism in poetry is defined as the late nineteenth century, but includes the poetry of [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]&lt;ref&gt;Sybille Baumback and others, "A History of British Poetry", Trier: WVT. {{ISBN|978-3-86821-578-6}}. Section 19: Poetic Genres in the Victorian Age I: Letitia Elizabeth Landon’s and Alfred Lord Tennyson’s Post-Romantic Verse Narratives by Anne-Julia Zwierlein.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bradford, ''A Linguistic History of English Poetry'', New York: Routledge, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;134. {{ISBN|0-415-07057-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Romanticism in music ==
Post-romanticism in [[music]] referred to [[romantic music|Romantic]] composers who would use [[musical form|forms]] that were found typically in the [[Classical music|Classical]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] while still retaining aspects of the Romantic era. Among the most well known post-Romantic composers are [[Puccini|Giacomo Puccini]] and [[Sergei Rachmaninov]]. [[Arthur Berger (composer)|Arthur Berger]]&lt;!--in an interview with Virgil Thomson--&gt; describes the mysticism of [[La Jeune France]] as post-Romanticism rather than [[Neoromanticism (music)|neo-Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Virgil Thomson,. ''Virgil Thomson: A Reader: Selected Writings, 1924-1984'', edited by Richard Kostelanetz, New York: Routledge, 2002p.&amp;nbsp;268. {{ISBN|0-415-93795-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Pfitzner]] also wrote post-Romantic works such as his opera ''Palestrina''.

Quite unlike Late Romantic composers such as [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Alexander Scriabin]], the composers of the Post-Romantic created music that would use either or both traditional form and [[harmony]]. [[Béla Bartók]], for example, "in such Strauss-influenced works as ''[[Duke Bluebeard's Castle]]''," may be described as having still used "[[consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] ['such intervals as fourths and sevenths'] for purposes of post-Romantic expression, not simply [always] as an appeal to the primal art of sound"—unlike [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and Strauss himself, who both believed in "a mythology of historical progress in Western music".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright,. ''Modernism and Music: An Anthology of Sources'',  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004pp.&amp;nbsp;243-44. {{ISBN|0-226-01267-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SummaryDiagramVertical.png|frame|right|The transition of [[communication technology]]: [[oral culture]], [[manuscript culture]], print culture, and [[Information Age]]]]
'''Print culture''' embodies all forms of printed text and other printed forms of [[visual communication]]. One prominent scholar in the field is [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]], who contrasted print culture, which appeared in Europe in the centuries after the advent of the Western [[printing-press]] (and much earlier in China where [[woodblock printing]] was used from 594 AD), to ''scribal culture''. [[Walter Ong]], by contrast, has contrasted written culture, including scribal, to [[oral culture]]. Ong is generally considered one of the first scholars to define print culture in contrast to [[oral culture]].  These views are related as the printing press brought a vast rise in literacy, so that one of its effects was simply the great expansion of written culture at the expense of oral culture.  The development of [[printing]], like the development of [[writing]] itself, had profound effects on human societies and knowledge. "Print culture" refers to the cultural products of the printing transformation.

In terms of image-based communication, a similar transformation came in Europe from the fifteenth century on with the introduction of the [[old master print]] and, slightly later, [[popular prints]], both of which were actually much quicker in reaching the mass of the population than printed text.

Print culture is the conglomeration of effects on human society that is created by making printed forms of communication. Print culture encompasses many stages as it has evolved in response to technological advances. Print culture can first be studied from the period of time involving the gradual movement from oration to script as it is the basis for print culture. As the printing became commonplace, script became insufficient and printed documents were [[mass production|mass-produced]]. The era of physical print has had a lasting effect on human culture, but with the advent of digital text, some scholars believe the printed word is becoming obsolete.

The [[electronic media]], including the [[World Wide Web]], can be seen as an outgrowth of print culture.

== The development of print ==

===Prior to print===
[[Oral culture]] was all that existed. Oral culture gradually found the need to store what was said for long periods of time, and slowly developed scribal culture. Scribal culture being inaccurate and tedious at best developed into print culture. Each segment is rich with its own effects on the world. Scribal culture, defined by the written or physical conveying of ideas, is important to understand in achieving a grasp on the unfolding of print culture itself. Scholars disagree over when scribal culture developed. [[Walter Ong]] argues that scribal culture cannot exist until an alphabet is created, and a form of writing standardized. On the other hand, [[D. F. McKenzie]] argues that even communicative notches on a stick, or structure, represent “text”, and therefore scribal culture.

Ong suggests scribal culture is defined by an alphabet. McKenzie says that the key to scribal culture is non-verbal communication, which can be accomplished in more ways than using an alphabet. These two views give rise to the importance of print culture. In scribal culture, procuring documents was a difficult task, and documentation would then be limited to the rich only. Ideas are difficult to spread amongst large groups of people over large distances of land, not allowing for effective dissemination of knowledge.

Scribal culture also deals with large levels of inconsistency. It was always considered that the oldest document was the most accurate, as it had been copied the least. In the process of copying documents, many times the meaning became changed, and the words different. Reliance on the written text of the time was never exceedingly strong. Over time, a greater need for reliable, quickly reproduced, and a relatively inexpensive means of distributing written text arose. Scribal culture, transforming into print culture, was only replicated in manners of written text.

===Development of print===
[[Image:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from [[Tang Dynasty]] [[China]], 868 AD ([[British Museum]])]] 
The Chinese invention of [[paper]] and [[woodblock printing]], at some point before the first dated [[book]] in 868 (the [[Diamond Sutra]]) produced the world's first print culture.&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 1-4. {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of [[books]], on subjects ranging from [[Confucian|Confusion Classics]] to [[science]] and [[mathematics]], were printed using [[woodblock printing]].

[[Paper]] and [[woodblock printing]] were introduced into Europe in the 15th Century, and the first printed [[book]]s began appearing in Europe. Chinese movable type was spread to Korea during the [[Goryeo Dynasty]]. Around 1230, Koreans invented a metal type movable printing which was described by the French scholar Henri-Jean Martin as "extremely similar to Gutenberg's".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15-23, 61-73.&lt;/ref&gt; East metal movable type was spread to Europe between the late 14th century and early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Polenz, Peter von. |title = Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart: I.

Early printers tried to keep their printed copies of a text as faithful as possible to the original manuscript. Even so, the earliest publications were still often different from the original, for a short time, in some ways [[manuscript]]s still remaining more accurate than printed books.

Hand-copied illustrations were replaced by first [[woodcut]]s, later [[engraving]]s that could be duplicated precisely, revolutionizing technical literature (Eisenstein 155).

== Print culture, the Renaissance, and the Reformation ==
Eisenstein has described how the high costs of copying scribal works often led to their abandonment and eventual destruction.  Furthermore, the cost and time of copying led to the slow propagation of ideas. In contrast, the printing press allowed rapid propagation of ideas, resulting in knowledge and cultural movements that were far harder to destroy.

Eisenstein points to prior renaissances (rebirths) of classical learning prior to the printing press that failed.  In contrast, the Renaissance was a permanent revival of classical learning because the printing of classical works put them into a permanent and widely read form.

Similarly, Eisenstein points to a large number of prior attempts in Western Europe to assert doctrines contrary to the ruling Catholic Church.  In contrast, the [[Protestant Reformation]] spread rapidly and permanently due to the printing of non-conformist works such as the [[95 Theses]].

===Renaissance===
With the shift towards printing presses in the West, after [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a method that was cheap, fast, and filling the demand for books, the Renaissance truly came into its own.  Even though the printing press was a paradigm shifting invention, printing had many critics, who were afraid that books could spread lies and subversion or corrupt unsuspecting readers.  Also, they were afraid that the printed texts would spread heresy and sow religious discord.  The [[Gutenberg Bible]] was the first book produced with moveable type in Europe.  Martin Luther's Bible, which was published in German in 1522, started the [[Protestant Reformation]].  Latin's importance as a language started languishing with the rise of texts written in national languages.  The shift from scholarly Latin to everyday languages marked an important turning point in print culture.  The vernacular Bibles were important to other nations, as well.  The [[Authorized King James Version|King James]] Authorized Version was published in 1611, for example.  Along with the religious tracts, the scientific revolution was largely due to the printing press and the new print culture.  Scholarly books were more accessible, and the printing press provided more accurate diagrams and symbols.  Along with scientific texts, like the works of [[Copernicus]],  [[Galileo]], and [[Tycho Brahe]], atlases and cartography started taking off within the new print culture, mostly due to the exploration of different nations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn.  Books: A Living History.  Paul Getty Museum, 2011.  Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
With the rise of literacy, books and other texts became more entrenched in the culture of the West.  Along with literacy and more printed words also came censorship, especially from governments.  In France, [[Voltaire]] and [[Rousseau]] were both imprisoned for their works.  Other authors, like [[Montesquieu]] and [[Diderot]], had to publish outside France.  Censored books became a valuable commodity within this environment, and an underground network of book smugglers started operating within France.  Diderot and Jean d'Alembert created the ''[[Encyclopedie]]'', which was published in 1751 in seventeen folio volumes with eleven volumes of engravings.  This work embodied the essence of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn.  Books: A Living History.  Paul Getty Museum, 2011.  Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Print culture and the American Revolution==

===A profound impact===
Numerous eras throughout history have been defined through the use of print culture. The [[American Revolution]] was a major historical conflict fought after print culture brought the rise of literacy. Furthermore, print culture's ability to shape and guide society was a critical component before, during, and after the Revolution.

===Pre-Revolution===
Many different printed documents influenced the beginning of the revolution. The [[Magna Carta]] was originally a scribal document of 1215, recording an oral transaction restricting the power of English kings and defining rights of subjects. It was revitalized by being printed in the 16th century and widely read by the increasingly literate English and colonial population thereafter.  The Magna Carta was used as a basis for the development of English liberties by [[Sir Edward Coke]] and became a basis for writing the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].

Additionally, during the 18th century, the production of printed newspapers in the colonies greatly increased. In 1775, more copies of newspapers were issued in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] than were printed in all of New England in 1754, showing that the existence of the conflict developed a need for print culture. This onslaught of printed text was brought about by the anonymous writings of men such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], who was noted for his many contributions to the newspapers, including the [[Pennsylvania Gazette]]. This increase was primarily due to the easing of the government's tight control of the press, and without the existence of a relatively free press, the American Revolution may have never taken place. The production of so many newspapers can mostly be attributed to the fact that newspapers had a huge demand; printing presses were writing the newspapers to complain about the policies of the British government, and how the British government was taking advantage of the colonists.

In 1775, [[Thomas Paine]] wrote the pamphlet "[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]," a pamphlet that introduced many ideas of freedom to the Colonial citizens. Allegedly, half a million copies were produced during the pre-revolution era. This number of pamphlets produced is significant as there were only a few million freed men in the colonies. However, "Common Sense" was not the only manuscript that influenced people and the tide of the revolution. Among the most influential were [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]]' "Rights of the British Colonies" and  [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]]'s "Farmer's Letters". Both of these played a key role in persuading the people and igniting the revolution.

===During the Revolution===
Newspapers were printed during the revolution covering battle reports and propaganda. These reports were usually falsified by Washington in order to keep morale up among American citizens and troops. Washington was not the only one to falsify these reports, as other generals (on both sides) used this technique as well. The newspapers also covered some of the battles in great detail, especially the ones that the American forces won, in order to gain support from other countries in hopes that they would join the American forces in the fight against the British.

Before the Revolution, the British placed multiple acts upon the colonies, such as the [[stamp act]]. Many newspaper companies worried that the British would punish them for printing papers without a British seal, so they were forced to temporarily discontinue their work or simply change the title of their paper. However, some patriotic publishers, particularly those in Boston, continued their papers without any alteration of their title.

The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] is a very important written document that was drafted by the original thirteen colonies, as a form of print culture that would declare their independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain and explained the justifications for doing so.  While it was explicitly documented on July 4, 1776, it was not recognized by [[Great Britain]] until September 3, 1783, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]].

===Post-Revolution===
After the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], a cluster of free states in need of a government was created. The basis for this government was known as the [[Articles of Confederation]], which were put to effect in 1778 and formed the first governing document of the United States of America. This document, however, was found to be unsuitable to outline the structure of the government, and thus showed an ineffectual use of print culture, and since printed texts were the most respected documents of the time, this called for an alteration in the document used to govern the confederation.

It was the job of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] to reform the document, but they soon discovered that an entirely new text was needed in its place. The result was the [[United States Constitution]]. In the form of written word, the new document was used to grant more power to the central government, by expanding into branches. After it was ratified by all of the states in the union, the Constitution served as a redefinition of the modern government.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] was noted as saying, “The basis of our government being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate for a moment to prefer the latter.” This serves as an excellent example of how newspapers were highly regarded by the colonial people. In fact, much like other forms of 18th century print culture, newspapers played a very important role in the government following the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. Not only were they one of the few methods in the 18th century to voice the opinion of the people, they also allowed for the ideas to be disseminated to a wide audience, a primary goal of printed text. A famous example of the newspaper being used as a medium to convey ideas were the [[Federalist Papers]]. These were first published in New York City newspapers in 1788 and pushed for people to accept the idea of the United States Constitution by enumerating 85 different articles that justified its presence, adding to a series of texts designed to reinforce each other, and ultimately serving as a redefinition of the 18th century.

== The state of print today ==
Today, print has matured to a state where the majority of modern society has come to have certain expectations regarding the printed book:
* The knowledge contained by printed books is believed to be accurate.
* The cited author of a printed book does indeed exist and is actually the person who wrote it.
* Every copy of a printed book is identical (at least in the important aspects) to every other copy, no matter how far apart the locations are in which they are sold.

Copyright laws help to protect these standards. However, a few regions do exist in the world where literary [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] has become a standard commercial practice. In such regions, the preceding expectations are not the norm. (Johns 61)

Currently, there are still approximately 2.3 billion books still sold each year worldwide. However, this number is steadily decreasing due to the ever-growing popularity of the [[Internet]] and other forms of digital media.

== Transition to the digital era ==
As David J. Gunkel states in his article "What's the Matter with Books?", society is currently in the late age of the text; the moment of transition from print to electronic culture where it is too late for printed books and yet too early for electronic texts. Jay David Bolter, author of ''Writing Space'', also discusses our culture in what he calls "the late age of print."  The current debate going on in the literary world is whether or not the computer will replace the printed book as the repository and definition of human knowledge. There is still a very large audience committed to printed texts, who are not interested in moving to a digital representation of the repository for human knowledge. Bolter, in his own scholarship and also along with Richard Grusin in ''Remediation'', explains that despite current fears about the end of print, the format will never be erased but only remediated.  New forms of technology (new media) will be created which utilize features of old media, thus preventing old media's (aka print's) erasure.  At the same time, there are also concerns over whether obsolescence and deterioration make digital media unsuitable for long-term archival purposes. Much of the early paper used for print is highly acidic, and will ultimately destroy itself.

The way that information is transferred has also changed with this new age of digital text and the shift towards electronic media. Gunkel states that information now takes the form of immaterial bits of digital data that are circulated at the speed of light. Consequently, what the printed book states about the exciting new culture and economy of bits is abraded by the fact that this information has been delivered in the slow and outdated form of physical paper.

In the article, [http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/%7Eeleclaw/ylj5.html "The First Amendment, Print Culture, and the Electronic Environment"], the author notes that expectations will change as information becomes less tied to specific locations, and as machines become networked and linked to other machines. This means that in the future certain goods will not be associated with their origins.

The article "The First Amendment, Print Culture, and the Electronic Environment" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060619192001/http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~eleclaw/ylj4.html]) also mentions how the new electronic age will make print better. Placing information into electronic form not only liberates the information from its pages but removes the need for specialized spaces to hold particular kinds of information. People have become increasingly accustomed to acquiring information from our homes that used to be only accessible from an office or library. Once computers are all [[computer networking|networked]], all information should, at least in theory, be accessible from all places. Print itself contained a set of invisible and inherent censors, which [[electronic media]] is helping to remove from the creation of text. Points of control that are present in print space are no longer present as distribution channels multiply, as copying becomes faster and cheaper, as more information is produced, as economic incentives for working with information increase, and as barriers and boundaries that inhibited working with information are crossed.

== Changes in technology and its effect on print culture ==
There are more online publications, [[Academic journal|journals]], [[newspaper]]s, [[magazines]], and businesses than ever before. While this brings society closer, and makes publications more convenient and accessible, ordering a product online reduces contact with others. Many online articles are anonymous, making the '[[death of the author]]' even more apparent. Anyone can post articles and journals online anonymously. In effect, the individual becomes separated from the rest of society.

The advances of technology in print culture can be separated into three shifts: 
*spoken language to the written word, 
*the written word to Printing press, 
*the printing press to the computer/internet.

The written word has made history recordable and accurate.  The printing press, some may argue, is not a part of print culture, but had a substantial impact upon the development of print culture through the times. The printing press brought uniform copies and efficiency in print. It allowed a person to make a living from writing. Most importantly, it spread print throughout society.

The advances made by technology in print also impact anyone using cell phones, laptops, and personal digital organizers. From novels being delivered via a cell phone, the ability to text message and send letters via e-mail clients, to having entire libraries stored on PDAs, print is being influenced by devices.

== Non-textual forms of print culture ==

Symbols, logos and printed images are forms of printed media that do not rely on text. They are ubiquitous in modern urban life. Analyzing these cultural products is an important part of the field of [[cultural studies]].  Print has given rise to a wider distribution of pictures in society in conjunction with the printed word.  Incorporation of printed pictures in magazines, newspapers, and books gave printed material a wider mass appeal through the ease of [[visual culture|visual communication]].

== Text and Print ==

There is a common miscommunication that occurs when discussing that which is
print and that which is text. In the literary world, notable scholars such as
[[Walter Ong]] and [[D.F. McKenzie]] have disagreed on the meaning of text. The
point of the discussion at hand is to have a word that encompasses all forms
of communication - that which is printed, that which is online media, even a
building or notches on a stick.  According to Walter Ong text did not come
about until the development of the first alphabet, well after humanity existed.
According to Mckenzie primitive humans did have a form of text they used to
communicate with their cave drawings.  This is discussed in [[literary theory]]. Print, however, is a representation of that which is printed, and
does not encompass all forms of communication (e.g. a riot at a football game).

'''Radical cheerleading''' is a performative style of political activism, derived from mainstream [[cheerleading]]. Radical cheerleading combines elements of peaceful protest or [[non-violent direct action]] with theatrical elements including costuming, spectacle and choreographed dance. Radical cheerleading was created by sisters Cara, Aimee and Colleen Jennings in Miami, Florida, in 1996.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; It grew to become an international movement with squads in the United States, Canada and Europe. Radical cheerleaders create and adapt [[Cheering|cheers]] that promote [[feminism]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nyHS4WyUKEC&amp;lpg=PT158&amp;ots=h1VYipd5FH&amp;dq=radical%20cheerleaders&amp;pg=PT158#v=onepage&amp;q=radical%20cheerleaders&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society|last=Grindstaff|first=Laura Anne|publisher=SAGE|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-0916-7|location=Los Angeles|page=126|chapter=Cheerleading: The Gender Politics of Contemporary Cheerleading}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Subculture ==
Over time, radical cheerleading developed into a subculture apart from [[cheerleading]]. To understand how radical cheerleading became a culture of its own, it is important to consider the impacts of mainstream cheerleading.

Mainstream cheerleading reached new heights of popularity in the 1990s, as it transformed from a form of entertainment to being understood as an athletic sport. The first Cheerleading World Championship took place in 2001, asserting cheerleading as a competitive sport. Still, cheerleaders were (and often still are) consistently stereotyped as unintelligent, ditzy, and promiscuous, as opposed to true athletes. Regular cheerleaders are often hypersexualized and defined by an idealized female body type. Author Christine Ro writes, "the popular image of cheerleading was still very much of the minimally dressed female cheerleader on the sidelines of a male sports event. This was the image radical cheerleaders seized upon in order to subvert gender messages while serving up peppy support for social justice causes."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/hey-hey-ho-ho-where-did-radical-cheerleaders-go|title=HEY HEY! HO HO! WHERE DID RADICAL CHEERLEADERS GO?|last=Ro|first=Christine|date=August 10, 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical cheerleaders reclaimed the identity of the cheerleader and re-shaped mainstream cheerleading to include all bodies, as opposed to certain bodies. They transformed cheerleading from a sideshow into the main event. They shifted the focus of cheerleading from sexualized spectacle to the promotion of larger ideas, like civilian empowerment and political awareness. In these ways, radical cheerleading developed into a distinct culture of its own.

== Gender non-conformity ==
Mainstream cheerleading is marked by heteronormativity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} In contrast, gender non-conformity is a foundation upon which the subculture of radical cheerleading developed. Since its creation, radical cheerleading has been a movement open to all: participants may be male, female, [[transgender]], non-binary or non-gender identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncXeMQUMtPgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=usJqypZj99&amp;dq=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;f=false|title=Cheerleader!: An American Icon|last=Adams|first=Natalie Guice|last2=Bettis|first2=Pamela|publisher=Palgrave|year=2003|isbn=978-1-4039-6184-6|location=New York|pages=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, radical cheerleaders subvert gender norms through costuming and aesthetics. According to author and radical cheerleader Jeanne Vaccaro, the movement was responsible for "cultivating a queer sensibility."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The subculture’s inclusion of non-gender-conforming individuals creates a space for all bodies, which in turn creates a uniquely accepting community. This is more than just an open-door policy, but an identifying characteristic of the subculture of radical cheerleading, just as relevant to the movement as the leftist messages it asserts.

== Aesthetics ==
Radical cheerleaders reappropriate the aesthetics of cheerleading, sometimes in an ironic fashion. Radical cheerleaders dress in diverse ways. Radical cheerleading is often marked by a DIY aesthetic, with handmade costumes and props. Some radical cheerleaders make [[Pom-pom|pom-poms]] using garbage bags by folding them in half, tying off one side with a rubber band and then cutting strips from the other end. 

Every squad has a unique aesthetic of its own. The Dirty Southern Belles, from Memphis, Tennessee, wear the colors pink and black to cheer for gay pride. The Pirate Cheerleaders, a squad from Milwaukee, wear black skirts with white pleats, and shirts with pirate logos when performing at basement punk shows. The New Paltz Rads, a squad from the State University of New York at New Paltz, sport signature colors black and red.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/were-here-we-cheer-get-used-it-136589|title=We're Here!

== Notable demonstrations ==
[[File:S15 Radical Cheerleading 1.jpg|thumb]]
Radical cheerleaders often perform at political [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], festivals and other feminist events, where they lead protest chants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aR5uGYkTj5UC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;ots=HVwsoN399_&amp;dq=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;f=false|title=Alternative Media and Politics of Resistance: A Communication Perspective|last=Atkinson|first=Joshua D.|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4331-0517-3|location=New York|pages=126–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical cheerleading is used at demonstrations to promote political messages in a media-friendly, people-friendly way. Radical cheerleaders may also perform on stage at music venues, to bring political issues (as well as entertainment) to an unsuspecting crowd. Chicago's Lickity Split radical cheerleaders frequently used this tactic.

A notable radical cheerleading appearance was at the [[March for Women's Lives]] in [[Washington, DC]] on April 25, 2004. The participants' aim was to raise awareness about the lack of access low-income women have to [[abortion]] clinics.

Another remarkable demonstration took place at a Taco Bell restaurant in Auburn, Alabama in 2001, where radical cheerleaders gathered to protest for fair wages. Dubbed the "Taco Bell Protest," participants explained to police that the purpose of their demonstration was to protest the business relationship between corporate Taco Bell and the Six L's Packing Company, Inc., a firm that pays employees low wages with zero benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/gimme-an-a-6323520|title=Gimme an A!|last=Roe|first=Amy|date=August 2, 2001|work=Broward Palm Beach New Times|access-date=April 2, 2016|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taco Bell Protest serves as an encapsulating example of all that radical cheerleading stands for: peaceful (if not disruptive) demonstration, DIY construction of protest tools/props, an anti-capitalist agenda, and a demand for fair wages, a classic feminist ideal. 

Radical cheerleaders demonstrated at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Resistin' Radicatz, a radical cheerleading squad, performed at the 2004 Million Worker March.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Cheer content ==
Cheers are usually written from scratch or by rewriting the words of popular and historic songs. The first radical cheer book was published in 1997.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

An example of a radical cheer, led by creator Cara Jennings, performed at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York:

{{Quote|Sound off! I don’t wanna work anymore! What did you say? I said the system doesn’t work anymore! What did you say? I said STOMP, smash the state, Let's liberate, Acknowledge me or go to hell, another womyn to rebel, let's liberate, Stomp, smash the state, let's liberate, organize and raise some hell, act up, unite and rebel!&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;}}

An example of a cheer performed by the Radical Teen Cheer Squad: "We're teens, we're cute, we're radical to boot! We're angry, we're tough, and we have had enough!"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Media ==
While the subculture has received some attention from the media, radical cheerleading receives less media attention than mainstream cheerleading.

In ''Give Me An F: Radical Cheerleading and Feminist Performance'', radical cheerleader and Author Jeanne Vaccaro describes the process of archiving radical cheerleading through the examination of cheers, zines, photographs and personal testimony from fellow radical cheerleader Mary Xmas.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/hawksites.newpaltz.edu/dist/1/2245/files/2018/01/Vaccaro_Radical-Cheerleaders-and-Feminist-Performance-289w2x9.pdf|title=Give Me an F: Radical Cheerleading and Feminist Performance|last=Vaccaro|first=Jeanne|date=January 2018|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419120655/https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/hawksites.newpaltz.edu/dist/1/2245/files/2018/01/Vaccaro_Radical-Cheerleaders-and-Feminist-Performance-289w2x9.pdf|archive-date=April 19, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech at the National Women's Studies Association in 2004, feminist magazine director [[Lisa Jervis]] placed radical cheerleading within a tradition of playful feminist comment on popular culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In August 2004 the New York City Radical Cheerleaders completed ''Don't Let the System Get You Down—Cheer Up'', a video documentary of the Radical Cheerblock at the March for Women's Lives. The video was released in time to celebrate and honor and inspire the hundreds of radical cheerleaders who converged in New York to protest the Republican National Convention.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Responses ==
Radical cheerleading is a style of performance, and is inherently defined by the element of spectacle. Responses within the media have ranged from positive to negative. Sheila Noone, the editorial director of ''American Cheerleader'' magazine, commented that cheerleaders are involved in an "uphill battle" towards gaining respect,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; asserting that radical cheerleading makes this even more difficult. In contrast, Lauren Jack, member of Harvard University's Cheerleading squad, made the statement that cheerleading is "all about trying to get everyone else excited about your causes, so it's perfect for political activism."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==History==
The application was developed by two former [[GMW Architects|GMW Computers]] employees who had been involved with  Sonata. After Sonata had "disappeared in a mysterious, corporate black hole, somewhere in eastern Canada in 1992,"&lt;ref name=Crotty71&gt;Crotty, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Ingram and colleague Gerard Gartside then went on to develop Reflex, bought for $30 million by Parametric Technology Corporation ([[PTC (software company)|PTC]]) in July 1996.&lt;ref name=Crotty71 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Parametric+Technology+Corporation+acquires+object-oriented+software...-a018490068 Parametric Technology Corporation acquires object-oriented software technology for project modeling and management] PTC news release dated 11 July 1996 (archived at FreeLibrary.com). Retrieved: 17 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

PTC had identified the architecture, engineering and construction market as a target for its parametric modelling solutions, and bought Reflex to expand into the sector. However, the fit between Reflex and PTC's existing solutions was poor, and PTC's Pro/Reflex gained little market traction; PTC then sold the product to another US company, [[The Beck Group|Beck Construction]], in 1997,&lt;ref name=Crotty72&gt;Crotty, p.72&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Some accounts of the date of this transaction vary: Beck Technology, originally an internal group within Beck Construction, says it acquired the intellectual property rights to Reflex from PTC in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beck-technology.com/about_us.html Beck Technology: About us], Beck Technology. Accessed: 17 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}} where it formed the kernel of a parametric estimating package called DESTINI.&lt;ref name=Weisberg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilitytechzone.com/news/2006/12/19/2179097.htm BIM software integrates RSMeans for project costing], ''Mobility Techzone'', December 19, 2006. Retrieved: 17 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, several people from PTC set up a new company, Charles River Software (renamed [[Autodesk Revit|Revit]] Technology Corporation in 2000, later (2002) bought by [[Autodesk]]).&lt;ref name=Crotty72 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weisberg&gt;Weisberg, David (2008), ''The Engineering Design Revolution: The People, Companies and Computer Systems That Changed Forever the Practice of Engineering''. Chapter 16. Available [http://cadhistory.net/ online]. Retrieved: 17 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonid Raiz]] and [[Irwin Jungreis]] obtained from PTC a non-exclusive, source code development license for Reflex as part of their severance package. In the words of Jerry Laiserin: "While Autodesk Revit may not contain genomic snippets of Reflex code, Revit clearly is spiritual heir to a lineage of BIM 'begats' — RUCAPS begat Sonata, Sonata begat Reflex, and Reflex begat Revit."&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2003) "[http://laiserin.com/features/issue17/feature02.php LaiserinLetterLetters]" (see Laiserin's comment to letter from John Mullan), ''The Laiserin Letter'', January 06 2003.{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 letter to ''AEC Magazine,'' Jungreis said:
:"After receiving several hours of instruction in the software architecture of Reflex from Reflex developers, we decided not to use it as our starting point because of several important differences at the very foundations of the software. At that point, we put it aside and never looked at it again. ... Revit was not based on Reflex. No code from Reflex was used...."&lt;ref name="AECM-25May2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrating the history of BIM (In response to this article, Dr. Irwin Jungreis, one of the founders of Revit, submitted a letter to AEC Magazine, reproduced in full.)|url=http://aecmag.com/59-features/1352-celebrating-the-history-of-bim|accessdate=21 August 2017|work=AEC Magazine|date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3081">[[Image:BlakeMalkin.jpg|thumb|William Blake's frontispiece to ''A Father's Memoirs of his Child'' (1806), engraved by Cromek.]]
'''Robert Hartley Cromek''' (1770–1812) was an English engraver, editor, art dealer and entrepreneur who was most active in the early nineteenth century. He is best known for having allegedly cheated [[William Blake]] out of the potential profits of his engraving depicting Chaucer's [[Canterbury Pilgrims]].

In the early years of the nineteenth century Cromek had supported Blake, and had engraved Blake's design for [[Benjamin Heath Malkin]]'s ''A Father's Memoirs of his Child'' in 1806. Cromek later commissioned Blake to illustrate [[Robert Blair (poet)|Robert Blair]]'s poem ''The Grave''. Blake had produced the designs, but his sample engraving was considered by Cromek to be too crude to attract subscribers. Cromek then gave the lucrative job of engraving Blake's designs to a rival engraver [[Luigi Schiavonetti]].

In response, Blake proceeded to create a self-engraved illustration to Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales''. Cromek, however, had also given the idea to Blake's friend [[Thomas Stothard]]. Stothard's print became far more popular than Blake's, at least during their lifetimes. It remains unclear whether Blake or Cromek originated this project, but Blake certainly believed that the idea was stolen from him. The incident destroyed the friendship between Blake and Stothard.&lt;ref&gt;Blake v. Cromek: A Contemporary Ruling, J. B. Mertz, ''Modern Philology'', Vol. 99, No. 1 (Aug., 2001), pp. 66-77&lt;/ref&gt;

As a savagely humorous comment on these events Blake wrote epigrams attacking Cromek:&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, Geoffrey, ''Blake: Complete Writings with variant readings'', Oxford University Press, 1972, p.540&lt;/ref&gt;   
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cromek loves artists as he loves his meat:&lt;br&gt;
He loves the Art; but 'tis the art to cheat.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A petty sneaking knave I knew--&lt;br&gt;
"O! Mr. Cromek, how do ye do?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1809 Cromek published ''Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song'', a collection of Scottish ballads. The aspirant poet [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]] sent in poems of his own authorship, which Cromek included in the collection, even though he may have suspected their real authorship.

About that time Cromek also compiled "RELIQUES OF ROBERT BURNS; Consisting Chiefly of Original Letters, Poems, and Critical Observations on Scottish Songs ". The original edition of 1808 contained a 4-page work by Thomas Stothard, "The Procession of Chaucer's Pilgrims to Canterbury", which did not appear in some later editions.

His son was the artist [[Thomas Hartley Cromek]].&lt;ref name=wake&gt;{{cite news|last=Fowler|first=James|title=A Biographical Notice of Thomas Hartley Cromek, Esq.|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wakefield_Express/Thomas_Hartley_Cromek|newspaper=Wakefield Express|date=19 April 1873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sarajevo Haggadah.jpg|thumb|right|Copies of the Sarajevo Haggadah in the parliament building of Bosnia and Herzegovina.]]
The '''Sarajevo Haggadah''' is an [[illuminated manuscript]] that contains the [[Jewish ceremonial art|illustrated traditional text]] of the [[Passover]] [[Haggadah]] which accompanies the [[Passover Seder]]. It is one of the oldest [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] Haggadahs in the world, originating in [[Barcelona]] around 1350. The Haggadah is owned by the [[National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in [[Sarajevo]]. Its monetary value is undetermined, but a museum in Spain required that it be insured for $7 million before it could be transported to an exhibition there in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://haggadah.ba/?x=1 |publisher=Haggadah.ba |title = The Sarajevo Haggadah |accessdate= 31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sarajevo Haggadah is handwritten on bleached calfskin and illuminated in copper and gold. It opens with 34 pages of illustrations of key scenes in the Bible from [[Creation myth|creation]] through the death of [[Moses]]. Its pages are stained with wine, evidence that it was used at many Passover Seders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Passover Relic|last=Reff|first=Zach|newspaper=San Diego Jewish Journal|url=http://www.sdjewishjournal.com/stories/apr06_4.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522034051/http://sdjewishjournal.com/stories/apr06_4.html|archivedate=22 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sarajevo Haggadah was submitted by Bosnia and Herzegovina for inclusion in UNESCO's [[Memory of the World]] Register and was included in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Sarajevo Haggadah manuscript | website=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization | url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-sarajevo-haggadah-manuscript/ | access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Sarejevohagadah.gif|thumb|left|An illustrated page from the Sarajevo Haggadah, written in fourteenth-century Spain. Top: [[Moses]] and the [[Burning Bush]]. Bottom: [[Aaron's staff]] swallows the magicians']]
The Sarajevo Haggadah has survived many close calls with destruction. Historians believe that it was taken out of Spain by Spanish Jews who were expelled by the [[Alhambra Decree]] in 1492. Notes in the margins of the Haggadah indicate that it surfaced in [[Italy]] in the 16th century. It was sold to the National Museum in Sarajevo in 1894 by a man named Joseph Kohen.&lt;ref name="exodus"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geraldinebrooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Korkut_near-final-pages.pdf|title= The Book of Exodus: A Double Rescue in Wartime Sarajevo|date=3 December 2007|last=Brooks|first=Geraldine|format=PDF| journal=The New Yorker|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, the manuscript was hidden from the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and [[Ustashe]] by the Museum's chief librarian, Derviš Korkut, who at risk to his own life, smuggled the Haggadah out of Sarajevo. Korkut gave it to a Muslim cleric in [[Zenica]], where it was hidden under the floorboards of either a mosque or a Muslim home.  In 1957, a facsimile of the Haggadah was published by [[Sándor Scheiber]], director of the [[Budapest University of Jewish Studies|Rabbinical Seminary]] in [[Budapest]].  In 1992 during the [[Bosnian War]], the Haggadah manuscript survived a museum break-in and it was discovered on the floor during the police investigation by a local Inspector, Fahrudin Čebo, with many other items thieves believed were not valuable. It survived in an underground bank vault during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]] by Serb forces. To quell rumors that the government had sold the Haggadah in order to buy weapons, the president of Bosnia presented the manuscript at a community Seder in 1995.

Afterwards, the manuscript was restored through a special campaign financed by the United Nations and the Bosnian Jewish community in 2001, and went on permanent display at the museum in December 2002.

In 1985 a reproduction was printed in Ljubljana, with 5,000 copies made. The National Museum subsequently authorized the publication of a limited number of reproductions of the Haggadah, each of which has become a [[collectable|collector's item]]. In May 2006, the Sarajevo publishing house Rabic Ltd., announced the forthcoming publication of 613 copies of the Haggadah on handmade parchment that attempts to recreate the original appearance of the 14th century original, alluding to the [[613 Mitzvot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://haggadah.ba/?x=4 |title=The Sarajevo Haggadah|work=haggadah.ba  |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a brief mention of the manuscript in the motion picture ''[[Welcome to Sarajevo]]''. The novel ''[[People of the Book (novel)|People of the Book]]'', by [[Geraldine Brooks (writer)|Geraldine Brooks]] (2008), crafts a fictionalised history of the Haggadah from its origins in Spain to the museum in Sarajevo. The Winter, 2002, issue of the [[literary journal]] Brick published [[Ramona Koval]]'s account of the disputes surrounding the proposed [[UNESCO]]-funded display of the original [[codex]] in the context of the post-[[Dayton Agreement]] UN-supervised 1995 peace settlement.

The history of Derviš Korkut, who saved the book from the Nazis, was told in an article by Geraldine Brooks in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="exodus" /&gt; The article also sets out the story of the young Jewish girl, Mira Papo, whom Korkut and his wife hid from the Nazis as they were acting to save the Haggadah. In a twist of fate, as an elderly woman in Israel, Mira Papo secured the safety of Korkut's daughter during the Bosnian war in the 1990s.

A copy of the Sarajevo Haggadah was given to former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair by the Grand Mufti of Bosnia and Herzegovina Mustafa Ceric during the awards ceremony for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's Faith Shorts competition in December 2011. The Grand Mufti presented it as a symbol of interfaith cooperation and respect, while recounting the protection of the Jewish book by Muslims on two occasions in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/blog/entry/faith-shorts-2011-awards-ceremony1/ |accessdate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203203801/http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/blog/entry/faith-shorts-2011-awards-ceremony1 |archivedate=3 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another copy was given by the Grand Mufti Ceric to a representative of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] during the interreligious meeting "''Living Together is the Future''" organised in Sarajevo by the [[Community of Sant'Egidio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avvenire.it/Chiesa/Pagine/haggadah-sarajevo-dono.aspx Dal muftì di Bosnia il dono dell'Haggadah al gran rabbinato di Israele], Avvenire&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the Haggadah's future exhibition was left in limbo following a drought in funding for the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which shuttered its doors after going bankrupt and not paying its employees for almost a year. In 2013 the [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]] attempted to arrange for a loan of the Haggadah, but due to internal political battles within Bosnia and Herzegovina, the loan was eventually refused by Bosnia’s National Monuments Preservation Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ben Zion|first1=Ilan|title=Hostage to politics, glorious Sarajevo Haggadah languishes in crumbling museum|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/hostage-to-politics-glorious-sarajevo-haggadah-languishes-in-crumbling-museum/|date=7 October 2014|website=The Times of Israel|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Haggadah was again on display as of September 2015, following the National Museum's re-opening. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294450-d644593-Reviews-National_Museum_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina-Sarajevo_Sarajevo_Canton.html#REVIEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17561">Educational settings as place and/or subject in fiction form the theme of this catalogue of titles and authors. Organized alphabetically by the author's last name, the information is further divided by general school environments and those where the university, specifically, is the primary focal point.  The list spans centuries and geographical boundaries, featuring Charlotte Brontë, Agatha Christie and Honore de Balzac as well as contemporary writers Curtis Sittenfeld, Joyce Carol Oates, and Donna Tartt.  For those interested in learning more about the school/university in literature, references are included that provide a more academic study of the subgenre.

'''''Selected Essays, 1917-1932''''' is a collection of [[prose]] and [[literary criticism]] by [[T. S. Eliot]]. Eliot's work fundamentally changed literary thinking and ''Selected Essays'' provides both an overview and an in-depth examination of his theory.&lt;ref name=BRags&gt;[[BookRags]]: ''Selected Essays of T. S. Eliot, 1917-1932 Study Guide&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in 1932 by his employers, [[Faber &amp; Faber]], costing 12/6 (''2009: £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.625|1932|2009|r=-0}}}}'').&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 16 September 1932; ''Some New Books''&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to his poetry, by 1932, Eliot was already accepted as one of English Literature's most important critics. In this position he was instrumental in the reviving interest in the long‐neglected Jacobean playwrights.&lt;ref name=OCAT&gt;Eliot, T[homas] S[tearns]"  The Oxford Companion to American Theatre, 3rd edn., Gerald Bordman and Thomas S. Hischak, eds., Oxford University Press 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Dialogue on Dramatic Poetry'' was originally an addendum to Eliot's preface to Dryden's ''[[Essay of Dramatick Poesie]]'' (1928 reprint).&lt;ref name=Baden&gt;Richard Badenhausen ''T.S. Eliot and the art of collaboration'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 2004, {{ISBN|0-521-84123-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further essays include ''The Metaphysical Poets (1921)'' in which Eliot argued that a "[[dissociation of sensibility]]" set in...  due to the influence of ... [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[Dryden]].&lt;ref Name=ODQ&gt;"T. S. Eliot"  Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. by Elizabeth Knowles. Oxford University Press Inc. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the modern poet ‘must be difficult’... ‘to force, to dislocate if necessary, language into his meaning’.&lt;ref&gt;"Eliot, T. S."  The Oxford Companion to English Literature. Edited by Dinah Birch.

'''''Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors''''' ({{lang-uk|Тіні забутих предків}}, ''Tini zabutykh predkiv''), also called ''Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors'', ''Shadows of Our Ancestors'', or ''Wild Horses of Fire'' &amp;ndash; is a 1965&lt;ref name="SteffenXVI"&gt;{{cite book |last= Steffen |first=James |date=2013 |title= The Cinema of Sergei Parajanov |url= https://books.google.com/?id=RbDxAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=shadows+parajanov+september+1964#v=snippet&amp;q=1964%20september&amp;f=false |location=Madison |publisher= University of Wisconsin Press |isbn= 978-0-299-29653-7 |page="xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; film by the Soviet filmmaker [[Sergei Parajanov]] based on the classic book by Ukrainian writer [[Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky]]. The film was Parajanov's first major work and earned him international acclaim for its rich use of costume and color. The film also features a detailed portrayal of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Hutsul]] culture, showing not only the harsh [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] environment and brutal family rivalries, but also the various aspects of Hutsul traditions, music, costumes, and dialect.

==Plot==
In a small [[Hutsul]] village in the [[Carpathian mountains]] of [[Ukraine]], a young man, Ivan, falls in love with the daughter of the man who killed his father. Though their families share a bitter enmity, Ivan and Marichka have known each other since childhood. In preparation for their marriage, Ivan leaves the village to work and earn money for a household. While he is gone, Marichka accidentally slips into a river and drowns while trying to rescue a lost lamb.

Ivan returns and falls into despair after seeing Marichka's body. He continues to work, enduring a period of joyless toil, until he meets another woman, Palahna, while shoeing a horse. Ivan and Palahna get married in a traditional [[Hutsul]] wedding in which they are blindfolded and yoked together. The marriage quickly turns sour, however, as Ivan remains obsessed with the memory of Marichka. Estranged from her emotionally distant husband, Palahna becomes involved with a local sorcerer, while Ivan begins to experience hallucinations.

At a tavern, Ivan witnesses the sorcerer embrace Palahna and strike one of his friends. Roused into an uncharacteristic fury, Ivan snatches up his axe, only to be struck down by the sorcerer. Ivan stumbles into the nearby woods and perceives Marichka's spirit to be with him, reflected in the water and gliding amongst the trees. As reality merges into dream, the colorless shade of Marichka reaches out across a great space and touches Ivan's outstretched hand. Ivan screams and dies. The community gives him a traditional Hutsul burial while children watch through cross braced windows.

==Themes==
The film is highly symbolic, making frequent use of religious and folkloric images that include crosses, lambs, graves, and spirits. The film also uses color to represent mood. During Ivan's period of mourning, black and white film stock is used. In other scenes, colors are often muted, but provide a contrast to vivid use of red and yellow. On its release, the film's presentation contrasted with the common [[socialist realism]] style that had government approval. After refusing to change the film, Parajanov was soon blacklisted from Soviet cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parajanov.com/maestro.html Sergei Paradzhanov&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Smiling Fishergirl''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Frans Hals]], painted in the early 1630s, now in a private collection.

==Painting ==
This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1910, who wrote "114. A WOMAN SELLING HERRINGS. [[Wilhelm von Bode|B]]. 51. ; In a dune landscape, a girl seen to the knees sits facing three-quarters right. She smiles and looks to the right. On her lap she holds with her left hand a wooden tub of herrings. She holds a fish in her right hand, which rests on the edge of the tub. She wears a red bodice, a white scarf, and a black cap. In the left distance is the sea. To the right are high dunes on which are two figures standing. To the left of them is the sail of a ship. The sky is covered with grey clouds. Three birds are flying. Signed on the tub with the monogram ; canvas, 32 inches by 26 1/2 inches. An old copy was in the possession of a London dealer in 1908. Engraved by [[Eugène Gaujean|Gaujean]]. In the Oudry collection. Sale. [[Étienne-Edmond Martin baron de Beurnonville|Baron de Beurnonville]], Paris, May 9, 1881, No. 302."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn03hofsuoft#page/31/mode/1up Hofstede de Groot] on ''A Woman Selling Herrings''; catalog number 114&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hofstede de Groot noted several fisherboys by Hals along with this one (catalogue numbers 49 through to 58c). This painting was also documented by [[W.R. Valentiner]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/franshalsdesmeis00valeuoft#page/117/mode/1up ''Junge Fischverkauferin'', number 117 left]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Guthrie - Statesmen of World War I.jpg|thumb|300px| Sir [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]], ''Statesmen of World War I'', 1930, [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]

'''''Statesmen of World War I''''' is an oil on canvas painting by Sir [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]], completed in 1930, shortly before Guthrie's death.  It was commissioned by South African financier Sir [[Abraham Bailey, 1st Baronet]] to commemorate the politicians and statesmen of Britain and its allies who held office during the First World War.  It was donated to the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in 1930, shortly after it was completed.

==Background==
Bailey commissioned two other commemorative portraits, ''[[General Officers of World War I]]'' (originally entitled ''Some General Officers of the Great War'') by [[John Singer Sargent]], and ''[[Naval Officers of World War I]]'' by Sir [[Arthur Stockdale Cope]]. Bailey paid £5,000 for each of the three paintings and donated all three to the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]].  The third painting, of statesmen, was first offered to Sir [[William Orpen]], but Orpen declined as he had already been commissioned as the official British artist of the [[Versailles Peace Conference]] (see, for example, ''[[The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors]]'').  Sargent suggested Guthrie instead.

As preparatory work, Guthrie painted a study of each subject separately, considerably delaying the process.  He held sittings in the springs and early summers of 1919 to 1921.  After a delay caused by Guthrie's illness, the work was first exhibited at the [[Scottish National Gallery]] in Edinburgh in early 1930.  Guthrie died in September 1930 before he could complete the final finishing touches before it went on display in London in October 1930.  His 17 oil studies and an oil sketch of the composition were donated to [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]].  Guthrie's study of Louis Botha was used by Sargent in making his painting of general officers.

==Painting==
The work measures {{convert|156|xx|132|in|cm}}.  It is a group portrait of seventeen figures, some seated and some standing.  Unlike the companion paintings by Sargent and Cope, which adopt landscape format to accommodate the many subjects, Guthrie used a portrait format.  The subjects are depicted as if in conference around a table in a large hall, in the shadow of a sculpture based on the [[Winged Victory of Samothrace]], with Doric columns to either side and coffered vault above.

The individuals depicted are, from left to right, starting with those seated on the left side of the table:
* Sir [[Joseph Cook]], former [[Prime Minister of Australia]] (1913–14), [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)]] (1914–1916), [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for the Navy]] (1917–20) (with beard)
* [[Billy Hughes]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]] (1915–23) (head resting on hand)
* [[David Lloyd George]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (1908–1915),  [[Minister of Munitions]] (1915–1916),  [[Secretary of State for War]] (1916), [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] (1916–1922)
* [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner]], [[Secretary of State for War]] (1918–19) (leaning forward)
* [[William Massey]], [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] (1912–25) (seated facing away)
* Sir [[Winston Churchill]], [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1911–15), [[Minister of Munitions]] (1917–19) (later [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], 1940–45 and 1951–55) (illuminated)
* [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon]], [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] (1905–16) (in profile with aquiline nose)

Standing behind Lloyd George are:
* [[Ganga Singh]], [[History of Bikaner|Maharaja of Bikaner]], only "non-White" member of the [[Imperial War Cabinet]]
* [[Louis Botha]], [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa]] (1910–19)

Behind Churchill are: 
* [[George Nicoll Barnes]], leader of the [[National Democratic and Labour Party]]
* Sir [[Robert Borden]], [[Prime Minister of Canada]] (1911–20) 

To their right are:
* [[Arthur Balfour]], 1st Earl of Balfour, former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] (1902-05); [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1915–16) and [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] (1916–19) (standing [[adlocutio]] in a black suit)
* [[H. H. Asquith]], 1st Earl of Oxford and Asquith, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] (1908–16) (sitting in front)
* Sir [[Eric Campbell Geddes]], [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1917–19) (behind, cleanshaven)
* [[Bonar Law]], [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)]] (1911–15), [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] (1915–16), [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (1916–19) (later [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], 1922–23) (dark moustache)
* [[Edward Morris, 1st Baron Morris]], [[Prime Minister of Newfoundland]] (1909–17) (white moustache, in the shadows)
* [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener]], [[Secretary of State for War]] (1914–1916) (in the shadows)

Bailey decided that the painting should include British and Dominion civilian leaders in office at the beginning and the end of the First World War.  It includes Prime Ministers of Australia, Canada, Newfoundland, and New Zealand, and the Prime Ministers, Foreign Secretaries, Secretaries of War, and First Lords of the Admiralty of the United Kingdom, together with two leaders of the British Conservative and Labour parties.  The [[Maharaja of Bikaner]], a member of the [[Imperial War Cabinet]] and the Indian delegate to the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], stands to the left next to Louis Botha, both in military uniform.

[[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|General Kitchener]] stands in military uniform on the far right, away from the others with his profile in deep shadow.  Kitchener died in the sinking of [[HMS Hampshire (1903)|HMS ''Hampshire'']] in 1916, so this portrait was posthumous.

'''Studio Furniture''' is a subfield of [[Studio Craft]] centered on one-of-a-kind or limited production [[furniture]] objects designed and built by craftspeople. The work is made in a craftsperson's [[studio]] setting as opposed to being made in a high volume factory. This conception of the site of production as being a studio links studio furniture to [[studio art]] and reflects its status as an individual creative process. Studio furniture objects often embody creative and/or communicative intent, a unique design, elements of functionality (either implicit or explicit), craftsmanship, and an intimate understanding of material in their creation. Studio furniture objects, perhaps because of their close association with sculpture and other fine art, are shown as often in art galleries as they are in furniture showrooms. As is the case in the Studio Crafts at large, this contested identity is the impetus for frequent intra-field dialogue and differing intellectual positions on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fullercraft.org/made-in-massachusetts-studio-furniture-of-the-bay-state/|title=Made in Massachusetts: Studio Furniture of the Bay State - Fuller Craft Museum|date=2013-07-31|work=Fuller Craft Museum|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/gene/american-studio-craft-movement|title=American Studio Craft Movement {{!}} Artsy|website=www.artsy.net|language=en|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements of Studio Furniture ==

'''Design'''&lt;br /&gt;
Studio Furniture incorporates the design process differently than [[Industrial Design]] or [[Product Design]], but the designing of the object is an integral and important part of its creation none-the-less. Because of the requisite functionality (or implied functionality) of Studio Furniture, makers must design objects so that they fulfill their intended physical purpose.  For example, a functional chair must be able to support the weight of the human body in a sitting position.  After this requirement is met, other purposes may also be supported; the chair might also be designed with certain [[ergonomic]] considerations for user comfort or it might additionally be able to support the body while standing or reclining.  While the meeting of physical requirements links Studio Furniture to other design fields, the expression of personal creative intent links the practice to the [[Fine Arts]].  Design comes into play in the realization of this intent as well; successful Studio Furniture must be designed to simultaneously meet conceptual needs without compromising its functional goals.

The practice of design within the field of Studio Furniture, as with other Studio Crafts, follows a trajectory that is unique in terms of the process of making.  The design process begins with preliminary sketches or models, but this is not a “preconceptualization of the finished work in all its elements and details” which would then be executed by a maker (separate from the designer), as it might be in a Product Design setting.  According to Howard Risatti in “A Theory of Craft,” “instead of being separated into stages, conception and execution are integrated so that a subtle feedback system occurs when physical properties of materials encounter conceptual form and conceptual form encounters physical material”&lt;ref&gt;Risatti, Howard Anthony. ''A theory of craft: function and aesthetic expression.'' The University of North Carolina Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (p169).  The design of the object, to a great degree, happens concurrently with its creation.  The skill of the maker and his or her ability to work with the subtleties and variations of the material, allowing those variations to inform and exalt the conceptual and functional goals of the piece, is intrinsically tied into the object’s design.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3868">'''Symphony No. 1''' (Op. 7) by Soviet-Russian composer [[Gavriil Nikolayevich Popov]] is a composition that was banned from performance in the [[U.S.S.R.]] until recently. Popov had completed a sketch of the first movement by August 1929 and was preparing its last (third) movement by February 1930.  The work, still in draft form, won a prize sponsored by the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] and the newspaper ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' in September 1932.  It received its premiere by the [[Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra]] under conductor [[Fritz Stiedry]] on March 22, 1935.&lt;ref name="Fanning"&gt;Fanning, David.  'Gavril Popov: Symphony No. 1.' Liner notes for ''Popov: Symphony No. 1, Op. 7; Shostakovich: Theme &amp; Variations, Op. 3.''  Telarc CD-80642, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fay"&gt;Fay, Laurel E. '[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E5DD1139F935A35757C0A9659C8B63 Found: Shostakovich's Long-Lost Twin Brother'].  ''New York Times.''  6 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

One day after its premiere, Popov's symphony was banned by the Leningrad censorship board for reflecting 'the ideology of classes hostile to us.'  Soviet authorities lifted the ban until Popov was denounced as a 'formalist' composer through his association with [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] in 1936.  Popov's symphony was denied further performance in the U.S.S.R. and, consequently, worldwide until after his death in 1972.&lt;ref name="Fanning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fay" /&gt;

Popov's ''Symphony No. 1'' is in three movements and roughly 50 minutes long, utilizing a large symphonic orchestra.  The movements are:

#''Allegro energico'' (about 23 minutes)
#''Largo con moto e molto cantabile'' (about 16 minutes)
#''Finale: Scherzo e Coda.  Prestissimo'' (about 9 minutes)

While obscure, Popov's ''Symphony No. 1'' holds a unique place in Soviet musical history and influenced composers such as [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] and [[Alfred Schnittke]]. The symphony was written during a period of greater Soviet artistic freedom, inspired by avant-gardists such as [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Béla Bartók]], and composers from the [[Second Viennese School]]. Also of influence were the late-romantic symphonies of [[Gustav Mahler]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Bruce A.  [http://www.old-yankee.com/writings/shosta.html Thesis: 'Dmitri Shostakovich, Politics, and Modern Music']  Providence, RI: Brown University, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Alex.  '[http://www.therestisnoise.com/2004/09/the_popov_disco.html The Popov Discontinuity'].  9 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popov's symphony is a highly dynamic work that uses [[expressionism]] and freeform styles of composition that were popular in Europe at the time.  The symphony is known as a major inspiration for Shostakovich's ''[[Symphony No. 4 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No. 4]]'', a similarly themed work in three movements.  Ironically, Shostakovich withdrew his symphony from its Leningrad premiere during this stretch of artistic repression and, like Popov's, was not heard in the concert hall until decades later.&lt;ref name ="Fay" /&gt;

After the 1936 debacle, Popov's composition style changed, fearing later condemnation by the Soviet government.  While suffering from emotional conflicts and worsening alcoholism, he wrote five other symphonies that are widely viewed as conformist and devoid of his earlier originality.  ''Symphony No. 1'' has experienced a modest revival by orchestras and recording labels such as [[Telarc]], but remains more of a curiosity than a normal part of the repertoire.&lt;ref name="Fay" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horton, Andrew J.  [http://www.ce-review.org/99/1/music1_horton.html 'The Forgotten Avant Garde: Soviet Composers Crushed by Stalin'].

[[File:Card Players-Paul Cezanne.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Paul Cézanne]]: ''The Card Players'' 1894–1895, [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris]]
'''''The Card Players''''' is a series of oil paintings by the French [[Post-Impressionist]] artist [[Paul Cézanne]]. Painted during Cézanne's [[Paul Cézanne#Final period, Provence, 1890–1906|final period]] in the early 1890s, there are five paintings in the series. The versions vary in size, the number of players, and the setting in which the game takes place. Cézanne also completed numerous drawings and studies in preparation for ''The Card Players'' series.
One version of ''The Card Players'' was sold in 2011 to the [[House of Thani|Royal Family of Qatar]] for a price variously estimated at between $250 million (${{Inflation|US|250|2011|r=1}} million today) and possibly as high as $300 million (${{Inflation|US|300|2011|r=1}} million today), either price signifying a new mark for [[List of most expensive paintings|highest ever price for a painting]], not surpassed [[Salvator Mundi (Leonardo)|until November 2017]].&lt;ref name=VanityFair&gt;{{cite web |last=Peers |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/02/qatar-buys-cezanne-card-players-201202 |title=Qatar Purchases Cézanne's The Card Players for More Than $250 Million, Highest Price Ever for a Work of Art |work=Vanity Fair |date=January 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The series is considered by critics to be a cornerstone of Cézanne's art during the early-to-mid 1890s period, as well as a "prelude" to his final years, when he painted some of his most acclaimed work.&lt;ref name=Dorment&gt;{{cite news |last=Dorment |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-reviews/8086198/Paul-Cezanne-The-Card-Players-Courtauld-Gallery-review.html |title=Paul Cézanne: The Card Players, Courtauld Gallery, review |work=The Telegraph |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each painting depicts [[Provence|Provençal]] peasants immersed in
their pipes and playing cards. The subjects, all male, are displayed as studious within their card playing, eyes cast downward, intent on the game at hand. Cézanne adapted a motif from 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch]] and [[17th-century French art|French]] [[genre painting]] which often depicted card games with rowdy, drunken gamblers in taverns, replacing them instead with stone-faced tradesmen in a more simplified setting.&lt;ref name=Dorment/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenberg |first=Karen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/arts/design/11cezanne.html?_r=1 |title=Workers at Rest: Smoking and Playing Cards |work=The New York Times |date=10 February 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas previous paintings of the genre had illustrated heightened moments of drama,&lt;ref name=MurphyA&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Richard A |year=1968 |title=The World of Cézanne |location=New York |publisher=Time-Life Books |page=111 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cézanne's portraits have been noted for their lack of drama, narrative, and conventional characterization.&lt;ref name=Wadley&gt;{{cite book |last=Wadley |first=Nicholas |year=1975 |title=Cézanne and his art |location=New York |publisher=Galahad Books |page=58 |isbn=0-88365-248-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than an unused wine bottle in the two-player versions, there is an absence of drink and money, which were prominent fixtures of the 17th century genre. A painting by one of the [[Le Nain]] brothers, hung in an [[Aix-en-Provence]] museum near the artist's home, depicts card players and is widely cited as an inspiration for the works by Cézanne.&lt;ref name=Salinger&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salinger |first1=Margaretta M. |date=Summer 1968 |title=Windows Open to Nature |journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin |volume=27 |issue=1 |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/publications/bulletins/1/pdf/3258395.pdf.bannered.pdf |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gaunt&gt;{{cite book |last=Gaunt |first=William |year=1970 |title=Impressionism: A Visual History |location=New York |publisher=Praeger Publishers |page=256 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The models for the paintings were local farmhands, some of whom worked on the Cézanne family estate, the ''Jas de Bouffan.''&lt;ref name=Salinger/&gt; Each scene is depicted as one of quiet, still concentration; the men look down at their cards rather than at each other, with the cards being perhaps their sole means of communication outside of work.&lt;ref name=Barnett&gt;{{cite news |last=Barnett |first=Laura |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/nov/07/another-view-cezanne-card-players |title=Another view Cézanne's The Card Players |work=The Guardian  |date=7 November 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One critic described the scenes as "human [[still life]]",&lt;ref name=Dorment/&gt; while another speculated that the men's intense focus on their game mirrors that of the painter's absorption in his art.&lt;ref name=Schjeldahl&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schjeldahl |first1=Peter |title=Game Change: Cézanne, card players, and the birth of modernism. |issue=28 February 2011 |page=78 |work=The New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2011/02/28/110228craw_artworld_schjeldahl |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paintings==
While there are, in total, five paintings of card players by Cézanne, the final three works were similar in composition and number of players (two), causing them to sometimes be grouped together as one version.&lt;ref name=Schapiro&gt;{{cite book |last=Schapiro |first=Meyer |year=1988 |title=Cézanne |location=New York |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |page=94 |isbn=0-8109-1043-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact dates of the paintings are uncertain, but it is long believed Cézanne began with larger canvases and pared down in size with successive versions, though research in recent years has cast doubt on this assumption.&lt;ref name=MurphyB&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Richard A |year=1968 |title=The World of Cézanne |location=New York |publisher=Time-Life Books |pages=119–20 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite news |last=Tompkins Lewis |first=Mary |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704422204576130550870695710 |title=New Lessons on an Old Hand |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Cezanne Les joueurs de cartes.jpg|thumb|right|''The Card Players,'' 1890–1892, [[Barnes Foundation]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]
The largest version, painted between the years 1890–1892, is the most complex, with five figures on a 134.6 x 180.3&amp;nbsp;cm (53 × 71 in) canvas. It features three card players at the forefront, seated in a semi-circle at a table, with two spectators behind. On the right side of the painting, seated behind the second man and to the right of the third, is a boy, eyes cast downward, also a fixed spectator of the game. Further back, on the left side between the first and second player is a man standing, back to the wall, smoking a pipe and presumably awaiting his turn at the table. It has been speculated Cézanne added the standing man to provide depth to the painting, as well as to draw the eye to the upper portion of the canvas.&lt;ref name=Dorment/&gt;
As with the other versions, it displays a suppressed storytelling of peasant men in loose-fitting garments with natural poses focused entirely on their game.&lt;ref name=MurphyA/&gt; Writer Nicholas Wadley described a "tension in opposites", in which elements such as shifts of color, light and shadow, shape of hat, and crease of cloth create a story of confrontation through opposition.&lt;ref name=Wadley/&gt; Others have described an "alienation" displayed in the series to be most pronounced in this version.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg/&gt;
The painting is owned and displayed by the [[Barnes Foundation]] museum in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

A more condensed version of this painting with four figures, long thought to be the second version of ''The Card Players'', is in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York. At 65.4 x 81.9&amp;nbsp;cm (25 3/4 x 32 1/4 in), it is less than half the size of the Barnes painting. Here the composition remains virtually the same, minus the boy, with viewers' perspective slightly closer to the game, but with less space between the figures. In the previous painting, the center player as well as the boy were hatless, whereas this version has all the men hatted. Also gone are the shelf to the left with vase and lower half of a picture frame in the center of the wall, leaving only the four pipes and hanging cloth to join the smoking man behind the card players. The painting is brighter, with less focus on blue tones, than the larger version. 
[[X-ray]] and [[Infrared microscopy|infrared studies]] of this version of ''The Card Players'' have shown layers of "speculative" graphite [[underdrawing]], as well as heavy layers of worked oil paint, possibly suggesting it was the preliminary of Cézanne's two largest versions of the series, rather than the second version as historically believed.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt; The underdrawing has also led analysts to believe Cézanne had difficulty transferring the men, previously painted individually in studies, onto one canvas.&lt;ref name=Dorment/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

It has been speculated that Cézanne solved this "spatial conundrum" in the final three versions of ''The Card Players'', by eliminating spectators and other "unnecessary detail" while displaying only the "absolute essentials": two players immersed in their game.&lt;ref name=Dorment/&gt;&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{cite book |last=Howard |first=Michael |year=1990 |title=Cézanne |location=New York |publisher=Gallery Books |page=118 |isbn=0-8317-2827-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene has been described as balanced but asymmetrical,&lt;ref name=Rosenberg/&gt; as well as naturally symmetrical with the two players being each other's "partner in an agreed opposition".&lt;ref name=Schapiro/&gt; The man on the left is smoking a pipe, wearing a tophat with a downcast brim, in darker, more formal clothing, seated upright; the man to the right is pipeless, in a shorter hat with upcast brim, lighter, more loosely fit clothing, and hunched over the table.&lt;ref name=Schapiro/&gt; Even cards themselves are contrasting light and dark hues. In each of the two-player paintings, a sole wine bottle rests in the mid-part of the table, said to represent a dividing line between the two participants&lt;ref name=Rosenberg/&gt; as well as the center of the painting's "symmetrical balance".&lt;ref name=Gaunt/&gt;
Of the three versions, perhaps the best known and most often reproduced is in the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris. It is also the smallest at 47.5 x 57&amp;nbsp;cm (17 3/4 x 22 1/2 in). The Orsay painting was described by art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] as "the most monumental and also the most refined" of the versions, with the shapes being simpler but more varied in their relationships.&lt;ref name=Schapiro/&gt; It is the most sparsely painted, and generally considered the last of the ''Card Players'' series.&lt;ref name=MurphyB/&gt;
 
There is a shift of axis to the scene, in which the player to the left is more completely in the picture, chair included, with the appearance of being nearer to us.&lt;ref name=Schapiro/&gt; His partner to the right is cut off from the scene at his back, and the table is displayed at an angle to the plane.&lt;ref name=Dorment/&gt; Critics have described a "deception of restraint" in Cézanne's use of color; graduated area of thinly applied, "priming" color used for solid forms and their appearance of structure is met with lilac and green used to "liven" the canvas, as well as the bright, deep color used on the lower half for the tablecloth.&lt;ref name=Gaunt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt; This version of the series was also part of a high-profile theft of eight Cézanne paintings from a traveling show at Aix in August 1961. The most valuable of the stolen works, ''The Card Players,'' was released as a four-color [[Commemorative stamp|postage stamp]] by the [[French Government|French government]] in recognition of the loss. All of the paintings were recovered after a paid ransom several months later.&lt;ref name=MurphyB/&gt;

The other two-player paintings are in the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] in London and in a private collection. In February 2012, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' reported that the royal family of [[Qatar]] had, during 2011, purchased their version of the painting for a record price variously estimated at between $250 million and $320 million from the private collection of Greek shipping magnate [[George Embiricos]].&lt;ref name=VanityFair /&gt;&lt;ref name=ARTnews&gt;{{cite web |last=Devine Thomas |first=Kelly |url=http://www.artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=1417 |title=The Most Wanted Works of Art |work=ARTnews |date=November 2003 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928094117/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=1417 |archivedate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies and sketches==
Cézanne created a substantial number of studies and preparatory drawings for ''The Card Players'' series. While it had long been believed he began the series with the largest paintings and subsequently worked smaller, 21st century [[x-ray]]s of the paintings as well as further analysis of preparatory sketches and studies has led some scholars to believe Cézanne used both the studies and the smaller versions of ''The Card Players'' to prepare for the larger canvases.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name=ArtDaily&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=41938 |title=Exhibition at The Courtauld Gallery Focuses on Cézanne's Paintings of Card Players and Pipe Smokers |work=artdaily.org |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a dozen initial sketches and painted studies of local farmworkers were made by Cézanne in preparation for the final paintings.&lt;ref name=ArtDaily/&gt; It has been speculated his models sat for the studies rather than the finished works themselves, and the painter possibly sketched preliminary work in an Aix cafe.&lt;ref name=MurphyB/&gt;

Some of the studies have been well regarded as stand-alone works of their own volition, particularly the accompaniment piece ''Man with a Pipe'', displayed alongside ''The Card Players'' at the Courtauld Gallery in London.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt; The former, along with two similar paintings of smokers undertaken in the same period, are considered by many to be some of Cézanne's most masterful portraits.&lt;ref name=MurphyB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

==Exhibitions==
In 2010–11, a joint exhibition was curated by the Courtauld Gallery in London and Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to display ''The Card Players'' paintings, early studies and sketches of the series, and accompanying works.&lt;ref name=ArtDaily/&gt; The exhibition ran in London from 21 October 2010 to 16 January 2011 and in New York from 9 February 2011 to 8 May 2011.

It was described as the first exhibition devoted to the series as well as the largest collection of Cézanne's ''Card Players'' paintings to ever be exhibited together.&lt;ref name=Sheppard&gt;{{cite news |last=Sheppard |first=David |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/07/us-exhibition-cezanne-cardplayers-idUSTRE7165PO20110207 |title=Cezanne's Card Player paintings to be shown in NY |work=Reuters |date=7 February 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition included the paintings owned by the Courtauld, Metropolitan, and Musée d'Orsay. The versions at the Barnes Foundation and in a private collection were displayed as prints, due to the Barnes' policy of not lending and the private collector declining to release the work.&lt;ref name=Sheppard/&gt; The mini-series of men smoking pipes sometimes referred to as ''The Smokers'' was also included with over a dozen other studies and sketches, however a legal dispute also prevented the [[Hermitage Museum]]'s version of ''Man with a Pipe'' from traveling to New York.&lt;ref name=Schjeldahl/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

'''''The Cornell Farm''''' (1848) is an [[oil on canvas]] [[landscape art|landscape]] by [[Edward Hicks]]. It was acquired by the [[National Gallery of Art]] in 1964. The picture depicts the farmland and cattle of Pennsylvanian James Cornell. Hicks's inscription along the bottom of the picture reads: "An Indian summer view of the Farm &amp; Stock OF JAMES C. CORNELL of Northampton Bucks county Pennsylvania. That took the Premium in the Agricultural society, October the 12, 1848 Painted by E. Hicks in the 69th year of his age." The work has been exhibited frequently, with its first display at the [[Bucks County]] Bi-Centennial Celebration, [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]], in 1882.

The NGA writes, "Having no background in academic art, Hicks employed the direct approach of a primitive or folk painter. The horizontal band of livestock across the foreground, although childlike in its simplicity, clearly presents each prize-winning animal as an individual portrait. Hicks' delight in creating ornamental pattern is evident in the arrangement of fences, while the rich red and bright white of the house and barn symmetrically flank this central landscape. Although the stark silhouettes of figures and buildings seem naive, Hicks softly blended his paints over the orchard to give the impression of space existing well beyond what the eye can see."

'''The Real Estate Show''' was a [[Colab]] sponsored illegal occupation exhibition on the subject of landlord speculation in [[real estate]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcnorio.org/about/history/res_manifesto.html] ''The Real Estate Show Manifesto'' or ''Statement of Intent Committee for the Real Estate Show'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; held on New Year's Eve in January 1980 in a vacant city-owned building at 123 [[Delancey Street]] in the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Schumann (ed.) ''A Book about Colab (and Related Activities)'' [[Printed Matter, Inc]], 2016. pp. 100-119&lt;/ref&gt; The squatter action followed a year of long and frustrating campaigning to rent the property for an exhibition space from officials of the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD).&lt;ref&gt;Julie Ault. ''Alternative Art, New York, 1965-1985'' [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2002: p.217.&lt;/ref&gt;

On New Year's Day the show was officially opened to the public. It was to be a two-week occupation/exhibit but was closed down by the police. On the morning of January 2, the Colab artists discovered the storefront padlocked from the inside, their work locked within. Phone calls revealed it to be the doing of HPD. ''The Real Estate Show'' had been open exactly one day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo McCormick]], ''The Downtown Book: The New York Art Scene, 1974–1984'', [[Princeton University]] Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, the artists, accompanied by art dealer Ronald Feldman and German [[conceptual art]]ist [[Joseph Beuys]] assembled at the site to protest its closing in the company of reporters from the [[New York Times]], Soho News, and the [[East Village Eye]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://98bowery.com/returntothebowery/abcnorio-the-real-estate-show.php]  ''The Real Estate Show'' By Lehmann Weichselbaum, [[East Village Eye]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; There was a photograph taken of Beuys at the front door of ''The Real Estate Show'' standing with Feldman, [[Alan W. Moore]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], Cid Collins and others taken that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://98bowery.com/return-to-the-bowery/abcnorio-the-real-estate-show.php ''The Real Estate Show'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11 city workers swept into 123 Delancey, cleared out the exhibited work and trucked it to an uptown warehouse. It was not until a few days later that artists were granted entry into the warehouse to take their art back home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://98bowery.com/returntothebowery/abcnorio-the-real-estate-show.php] ''The Real Estate Show'' by Lehmann Weichselbaum, ''East Village Eye'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16 a deal was reached with the city that gave birth to [[ABC No Rio]] when, as a compromise, a city agency gave the artists control of nearby 156 [[Rivington Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://1981.nyc/formation-abc-no-rio/ The Formation of ABC NO RIO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Real Estate Show Revisited==
In early 2014, there were four concurrent art exhibitions in New York City around ''The Real Estate Show'': at James Fuentes Gallery, [[ABC No Rio]], the Lodge Gallery, and Cuchifritos Gallery/Essex Street Market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2014/03/the-real-estate-show-revisted-at-the-james-fuentes-gallery.html] ''The Real Estate Show Revisited''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bedfordandbowery.com/2014/04/a-legendary-exhibition-the-real-estate-show-has-been-revived-on-the-les/] Article on James Fuentes Gallery show "Real Estate Show, Then...And Now"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://artfcity.com/2014/04/08/the-real-estate-show-slideshow-and-commentary/] ''The Real Estate Show'' Slideshow and Commentary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperallergic.com/122204/putting-the-no-in-nostalgia/] Putting the ‘No’ in ‘Nostalgia’ by [[Robert C.

In June 2017, Becky Howland &amp; Matthias Mayer curated ''The Real Estate Show'' at Spor Klubu in Berlin, drawing from documentation of the original ''Real Estate Show'' (1980) from the Archive Collection of the extant project space [[ABC No Rio]]. Included in the show were Robert Cooney, Mitch Corber, Peter Fend, Coleen Fitzgibbon, Bobby G (Robert Goldman), Ilona Granet, Becky Howland, Christof Kohlhofer, Gregory Lehmann, Ann Messner, Peter Mönnig, Alan Moore, Joseph Nechvatal, Cara Perlman, Scott Pfaffman, Christy Rupp and Robin Winters. In conjunction with this show, another exhibition called ''The Real Estate Show Extended/Berlin: Group exhibition on the subject of [[Gentrification]], Real Estate Speculation and Selling out the City'' was presented at Kunstpunkt Berlin. This show included many Berlin artists along with four original members of the ''Real Estate Show'' (1980): Becky Howland, Peter Mönnig, Alan Moore, and Joseph Nechvatal. Howland, Mönnig, Moore and Nechvatal also participated in a panel discussion on Real Estate and Art on June 3rd, 2017 that was moderated by Howard McCalebb of Dada Post, Berlin. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunstpunkt.com/pages/ausstell_fr.htm] ''The Real Estate Show'' at Kunstpunkt Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;
