He was a psychologist who focused on SOCE, and wrote on the topic. Although raised by a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] mother and a [[Baptist]] father, Byrd converted to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and was very active in the debate within the LDS Church on issues involving [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name=NoMoreGoodbyesReview /&gt;

==Professional life==
Byrd  was a well known supporter of [[conversion therapy]], and authored more than 100 publications, including books, peer-reviewed scientific journals, law journals, book chapters, invited commentaries and opinion editorials, many of which addressed issues of human sexuality.  In 2002, he presented a paper which describes a technique called ''gender-affirmative therapy''. He stated: "The basic premise of gender-affirmative therapy is that social and emotional variables affect gender identity which, in turn, determines sexual orientation. The work of the therapist is to help people understand their gender development. Subsequently, such individuals are able to make choices that are consistent with their value system. The focus of therapy is to help clients fully develop their masculine or feminine identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

One of the largest was a survey of 882 people who were undergoing therapy, attending ex-gay groups or ex-gay conferences: 22.9% reported they had not undergone any changes, 42.7% reported some changes, and 34.3% reported much change in sexual orientation. As a group, they reported large reductions in homosexual thoughts and fantasies and improvements in their psychological, interpersonal, and spiritual well-being.&lt;ref name="Nicolosi2000"&gt;{{cite journal

Byrd received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[psychology]] from [[Brigham Young University]], a post-doctoral degree in Child and Family Psychology from [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] and [[Medical College of Virginia]], and a post-doctoral degree in [[Behavioral Medicine]] from [[Loyola University, Chicago]]. He also received both an [[Master of Public Health|M.P.H.]] from the [[University of Utah]], School of Medicine, and an [[M.B.A.]] also from the [[University of Utah]]. He was a diplomate in [[forensic medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meridianmagazine.com/familywatch/040902Born.html Meridian Magazine :Born That Way?

Byrd served as the Director of Clinical Training for [[LDS Social Services]], was a Clinical Professor at [[Brigham Young University]], and was, at the time of his death, a Clinical Professor at the [[University of Utah]], School of Medicine, with appointments in the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine and in Department of Psychiatry, with an adjunct clinical appointment in the Department of Family Studies, also at the University of Utah.

He also had training in genetics, biochemistry and neurochemistry from the [[University of California at Berkeley]].

==Within the LDS Church==
{{further|Homosexuality and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The LDS Church does not view homosexual attractions as sinful, but does teach its members to abstain from homosexual sex. It does not have an official view on the cause of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/manual/god-loveth-his-children/god-loveth-his-children|title=God Loveth His Children |accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Byrd had been prominent in defending and explaining the church's position, as well as promoting his own views. He wrote four books aimed at LDS audiences and, in 1999, published ''When a Loved One Struggles with Same-Sex Attraction'' in the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', an official magazine of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

During their development the [[Spermatogonium|spermatogonia]] proceed through [[meiosis]] to become spermatozoa. Many changes occur during this process: the DNA in nuclei becomes condensed; the [[acrosome]] develops as a structure close to the nucleus. The acrosome is derived from the [[Golgi apparatus]] and contains hydrolytic enzymes important for fusion of the spermatozoon with an [[Ovum|egg cell]]. During spermiogenesis the nucleus condenses and changes shape. Abnormal shape change is a feature of sperm in [[Infertility|male infertility]].

[[File:KunsthistorischesMuseumAmazonen.jpg|thumb|Relief now in [[Vienna]]]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Amazonomachy''' ([[English language|English translation]]: "Amazon battle"; plural, '''Amazonomachiai''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀμαζονομαχίαι}}) or '''Amazonomachies''') was one of various mythical battles between the Ancient [[Greeks]] and the [[Amazons]], a nation of all-female warriors. Many of the myths portrayed were that of [[Heracles]]' ninth labor, which was the retrieval of the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], Queen of the Amazons, and of [[Theseus]]' abduction of Hippolyta, whom he claimed as his wife. Another famous scene portrayed is that of [[Achilles]]' victorious battle against [[Penthesilea]] during the [[Trojan war]].

The subject was popular in [[ancient Greek art]] and [[Roman art]].

[[File:Amazonomachy Met 31.11.13.jpg|thumb|Detail of vase, c. 420 BC]]
Amazonomachy represents the Greek ideal of civilization. The Amazons were portrayed as a savage and barbaric race, while the Greeks were portrayed as a civilized race of human progress. 
According to [[Bruno Snell]]'s view of Amazonomachy

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the Greeks, the [[Titanomachy]] and the battle against the giants remained symbols of the victory which their own world had won over a strange universe; along with the battles against the Amazons and [[Centaur]]s they continue to signalize the Greek conquest of everything barbarous, of all monstrosity and grossness.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, Page (1982). ''Centaurs and Amazons: Women and the Pre-History of the Great Chain of Being''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Produzione greca o magnogreca, sarcofago dipinto delle amazzoni, 350-325 a.C. ca, da tarquinia 09.jpg|thumb|Detail from painted [[sarcophagus]] found in Italy, 350-325 BC]]

Amazonomachy is also seen as the rise of [[feminism]] in Greek culture. In [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]'s ''The Fall of Troy'', Penthesilea, an Amazonian queen, who joined on the side of the [[Troy|Trojan]]s during the Trojan war, was quoted at [[Troy]], saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not in strength are we inferior to men; the same our eyes, our limbs the same; one common light we see, one air we breathe; nor different is the food we eat. What then denied to us hath heaven on man bestowed?&lt;ref&gt;Quintus Smyrnaeus. "The Fall of Troy." Translated by Way. A. S. Loeb Classical Library Volume 19. London: William Heinemann, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Josine Blok]], Amazonomachy provides two different contexts in defining a Greek hero. Either the Amazons are one of the disasters from which the hero rids the country after his victory over a monster; or they are an expression of the underlying [[Attis]] motif, in which the hero shuns human sexuality in marriage and procreation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josine Blok|Blok, Josine]] (1994). ''The Early Amazons: Modern and Ancient Perspectives on a Persistent Myth''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 5th century, the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of [[Persia]] began a series of [[Greco-Persian Wars|invasions against Ancient Greece]]. Because of this, some scholars believe that on most 5th-century Greek art, the Persians were shown allegorically, through the figure of centaurs and Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, Page (1982). ''Centaurs and Amazons: Women and the Pre-History of the Great Chain of Being''&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
Warfare was a very [[Warfare in ancient Greek art|popular subject in Ancient Greek art]], represented in grand sculptural scenes on temples but also countless [[Greek vases]].  On the whole fictional and mythical battles were preferred as subjects to the many historical ones available. Along with scenes from [[Homer]] and the [[Giants_(Greek_mythology)#The_Gigantomachy|Gigantomachy]], a battle between the race of Giants and the Olympian gods, the Amazonomachy was a [[Amazons#In_art|popular choice]].

Later, in [[Roman art]], there are many depictions on the sides of later Roman [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], when it became the fashion to depict elaborate reliefs of battle scenes.  Scenes were also shown on mosaics.  A trickle of medieval depictions increased at the Renaissance, and especially in the [[Baroque]] period.

===West metopes of Parthenon===
Kalamis, a Greek sculptor, is attributed to designing the west [[metope (architecture)|metope]]s of the [[Parthenon]], a temple on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Athenian Acropolis]] dedicated to the Greek goddess [[Athena]].&lt;ref name="Neils2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jenifer Neils|title=The Parthenon: From Antiquity to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gA81kINAI9cC&amp;pg=PA67|date=5 September 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-82093-6|page=67|quote=The Parthenon (Plate 1, Fig. 17) is probably the most celebrated of all Greek temples. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HambidgeFund1924"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jay Hambidge|author2=Yale University. Rutherford Trowbridge Memorial Publication Fund|title=The Parthenon and other Greek temples: their dynamic symmetry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xH9TAAAAMAAJ|year=1924|publisher=Yale university press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The west metopes of the Parthenon depict a battle between Greeks and Amazons. Despite its mutilated state, scholars generally concur that the scene represents the Amazon invasion of [[Attica]].&lt;ref&gt;Castriota, David (1992). ''Myth, Ethos, and Actuality: Official Art in Fifth Century B.C. Athens''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shield of Athena Parthenos===
The shield of [[Athena Parthenos]], sculpted by [[Phidias]], depicts a fallen Amazon. Athena Parthenos was a massive [[chryselephantine]] sculpture of Athena, the main [[cult image]] inside the [[Parthenon]] at Athens, which is now lost, though known from descriptions and small ancient copies.&lt;ref&gt;Castriota, David (1992). ''Myth, Ethos, and Actuality: Official Art in Fifth Century B.C. Athens''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bassae Frieze in Temple of Apollo===
[[File:The Bassai sculptures, marble block from the frieze of the Temple of Apollo Epikourios at Bassae (Greece), Greeks fight Amazons, about 420-400 BC, British Museum (14073518379).jpg|thumb|left|Block from the [[Bassae Frieze]], c. 420-400 BC]]
The [[Bassae Frieze]] in the Temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Bassae]] contains a number of slabs portraying Trojan Amazonomachy and Heraclean Amazonomachy. The Trojan Amazonomachy spans three blocks, displaying the eventual death of Penthesilea at the hands of Achilles. The Heraclean Amazonomachy spans eight blocks and represents the struggle of Heracles to seize the belt of the Amazon queen Hippolyta.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Frederick (1992). ''The Temple of Apollo Bassitas: The Sculpture, Volume 2''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amazonomachy frieze from Mausoleum at Halicarnassus===
[[File:Amazon Frieze BM GR 1865.7-23.1 n01.jpg|thumb|[[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]]]]
Several sections of an Amazonomachy [[frieze]] from the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]] are now in the [[British Museum]].  One part depicts [[Heracles]] grasping an Amazon by the hair, while holding a club behind his head in a striking manner. This Amazon is believed to be the Amazon queen [[Hippolyta]]. Behind Heracles is a scene of a Greek warrior clashing shields with an Amazon warrior. Another slab displays a mounted Amazon charging at a Greek, who is defending himself with a raised shield. This Greek is believed to be [[Theseus]], who joined Heracles during his labours.

[[Micon]] painted the Amazonomachy on the [[Stoa Poikile]] of the [[Ancient Agora of Athens]], which is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Micon#ref291408 Micon-Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Phidias]] depicted Amazonomachy on the footstool of the [[chryselephantine statue of Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Woodard| first = Roger D.| title = The Cambridge Companion to Greek Mythology| url = https://books.google.gr/books?id=TQyRX6WmMUMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|date=January 2008| page = 298| isbn = 978-0521607261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, archaeologists discovered relief-decorated shoulder boards made from bronze that were part of a [[breastplate]] of a Greek warrior at a Celtic sacrificial place near the village of [[Slatina nad Bebravou]] in [[Slovakia]]. Deputy of director of Slovak Archaeological Institute said that it is the oldest original Greek art relic in the area of Slovakia. Researchers analyzed the pieces and determined they were once part of a relief that depicted the Amazonomachy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20822300/archaeologists-find-oldest-greek-relic-in-slovak-area.html Archaeologists find oldest Greek relic in Slovak area]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''angular diameter''', '''angular size''', '''apparent diameter''', or '''apparent size''' is an angular measurement describing how large a [[sphere]] or [[circle]] appears from a given point of view. In the [[vision sciences]], it is called the [[visual angle]], and in [[optics]], it is the [[angular aperture]] (of a [[lens (optics)|lens]]). The angular diameter can alternatively be thought of as the angle through which an eye or camera must rotate to look from one side of an apparent circle to the opposite side. '''Angular radius''' equals half the angular diameter.

==Formula==
[[File:Angular dia formula.JPG|thumb|400px|right|Diagram for the formula of the angular diameter]]

The angular diameter of a [[circle]] whose plane is perpendicular to the displacement vector between the point of view and the centre of said circle can be calculated using the formula&lt;ref&gt;This can be derived using the formula for the length of a cord found at {{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularSegment.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221042937/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularSegment.html |archivedate=2014-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta =  2\arctan \left(\frac{d}{2D}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
in which &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the angular diameter, and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; are the actual diameter of and the distance to the object. When &lt;math&gt;D \gg d&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\delta \approx d / D&lt;/math&gt;, and the result obtained is in [[radians]].

For a spherical object whose ''actual'' diameter equals &lt;math&gt;d_\mathrm{act},&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the ''centre'' of the sphere, the angular diameter can be found by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\delta =  2\arcsin \left(\frac{d_\mathrm{act}}{2D}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The difference is due to the fact that the apparent edges of a sphere are its tangent points, which are closer to the observer than the centre of the sphere. For practical use, the distinction is only significant for spherical objects that are relatively close, since the [[small-angle approximation]] holds for &lt;math&gt; x \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathstat.concordia.ca/faculty/rhall/mc/arctan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218190328/http://www.mathstat.concordia.ca/faculty/rhall/mc/arctan.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\arcsin x \approx \arctan x \approx x&lt;/math&gt; .

==Estimating angular diameter using the hand==
[[File:Estimating angular size with hand.gif|thumb|Approximate angles of 10°, 20°, 5°, and 1° for the hand outstretched arm's length.]]

==Use in astronomy==
[[File:Angular diameter.jpg|thumb|300px|Angular diameter: the angle subtended by an object]]

In [[astronomy]], the sizes of [[celestial object]]s are often given in terms of their angular diameter as seen from [[Earth]], rather than their actual sizes. Since these angular diameters are typically small, it is common to present them in [[arcsecond]]s (″). An arcsecond is 1/3600th of one [[degree (angle)|degree]] (1°), and a radian is 180/&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; degrees, so one radian equals 3,600*180/&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; arcseconds, which is about 206,265 arcseconds. Therefore, the angular diameter of an object with physical diameter ''d'' at a distance ''D'', expressed in arcseconds, is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stars and Galaxies |author=Michael A. Seeds |author2=Dana E. Backman |publisher=Brooks Cole |date=2010 |edition=7 |page=39 |isbn=978-0-538-73317-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; = (206,265) ''d'' / ''D'' arcseconds.

These objects have an angular diameter of 1″:
*an object of diameter 1 cm at a distance of 2.06 km
*an object of diameter 725.27&amp;nbsp;km at a distance of 1 [[astronomical unit]] (AU)
*an object of diameter 45&amp;nbsp;866&amp;nbsp;916&amp;nbsp;km at 1 [[light-year]]
*an object of diameter 1 AU (149&amp;nbsp;597&amp;nbsp;871&amp;nbsp;km) at a distance of 1 [[parsec]] (pc)

Thus, the angular diameter of [[Earth's orbit]] around the [[Sun]] as viewed from a distance of 1 pc is 2″, as 1 AU is the mean radius of Earth's orbit.

The angular diameter of the Sun, from a distance of one [[light-year]], is 0.03″, and that of [[Earth]] 0.0003″. The angular diameter 0.03″ of the Sun given above is approximately the same as that of a person at a distance of the diameter of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;hs=3cj&amp;q=arctan%286ft+%2F+12756.3+Km%29+in+arcseconds&amp;btnG=Search&lt;/ref&gt;

Alnitak is a blue star so it gives off a lot of light for its size. If it were 800 000 times further away then it would be magnitude 31.5, at the limit of what Hubble can see.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Comparison angular diameter solar system.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of angular diameter of the Sun, Moon and planets. To get a true representation of the sizes, view the image at a distance of 103 times the width of the "Moon: max." circle. For example, if this circle is 5 cm wide on your monitor, view it from 5.15 m away.]]
[[File:Jupiter.mit.Io.Ganymed.Europa.Calisto.Vollmond.10.4.2017.jpg|thumb|250px|This photo compares the apparent sizes of [[Jupiter]] and its four [[Galilean moons]] ([[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] at maximum [[elongation (astronomy)|elongation]]) with the apparent diameter of the [[full moon|full Moon]] during their [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] on 10 April 2017.]]

The table shows that the angular diameter of Sun, when seen from Earth is approximately 32′ (1920″ or 0.53°), as illustrated above.

Thus the angular diameter of the Sun is about 250,000 times that of [[Sirius]]. (Sirius has twice the diameter and its distance is 500,000 times as much; the Sun is 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; times as bright, corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, so Sirius is roughly 6 times as bright per unit [[solid angle]].)

The angular diameter of the Sun is also about 250,000 times that of [[Alpha Centauri A]] (it has about the same diameter and the distance is 250,000 times as much; the Sun is 4×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; times as bright, corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 200,000, so Alpha Centauri A is a little brighter per unit solid angle).

The angular diameter of the Sun is about the same as that of the [[Moon]]. (The Sun's diameter is 400 times as large and its distance also; the Sun is 200,000 to 500,000 times as bright as the full Moon (figures vary), corresponding to an angular diameter ratio of 450 to 700, so a celestial body with a diameter of 2.5–4″ and the same brightness per unit solid angle would have the same brightness as the full Moon.)

Even though Pluto is physically larger than Ceres, when viewed from Earth (e.g., through the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]) Ceres has a much larger apparent size.

Angular sizes measured in degrees are useful for larger patches of sky. (For example, the three stars of [[Orion's Belt|the Belt]] cover about 4.5° of angular size.) However, much finer units are needed to measure the angular sizes of galaxies, nebulae, or other objects of the [[night sky]].

Degrees, therefore, are subdivided as follows:
* 360 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s (°) in a full circle
* 60 [[arc-minute]]s (′) in one degree
* 60 [[arc-second]]s (″) in one arc-minute

To put this in perspective, the [[full moon|full Moon]] as viewed from Earth is about {{frac|1|2}°, or 30′ (or 1800″). The Moon's motion across the sky can be measured in angular size: approximately 15° every hour, or 15″ per second. A one-mile-long line painted on the face of the Moon would appear from Earth to be about 1″ in length.

In astronomy, it is typically difficult to directly measure the distance to an object, yet the object may have a known physical size (perhaps it is similar to a closer object with known distance) and a measurable angular diameter. In that case, the angular diameter formula can be inverted to yield the [[angular diameter distance]] to distant objects as 
:&lt;math&gt;d \equiv 2 D \tan \left( \frac{\delta}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

In non-Euclidean space, such as our expanding universe, the angular diameter distance is only one of several definitions of distance, so that there can be different "distances" to the same object.  See [[Distance measures (cosmology)]].

===Non-circular objects===
Many [[deep-sky object]]s such as [[galaxies]] and [[nebula]]e appear non-circular and are thus typically given two measures of diameter: major axis and minor axis. For example, the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] has a visual apparent diameter of {{DEC|5|20}} × {{DEC|3|5}}.

===Defect of illumination===
Defect of illumination is the maximum angular width of the unilluminated part of a celestial body seen by a given observer. For example, if an object is 40″ of arc across and is 75% illuminated, the defect of illumination is 10″.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1715">'''Animal symbolicum''' ("symbol-making" or "symbolizing animal") is a [[List of alternative names for the human species|definition for humans]] proposed by the German [[neo-Kantian]] [[Ernst Cassirer]]. 

The tradition since [[Aristotle]] has defined a human being as ''animal rationale'' (a [[rational animal]]). However, Cassirer claimed that man's outstanding characteristic is not in his [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or physical nature, but rather in his work. [[Human]]ity cannot be known directly, but has to be known through the analysis of the symbolic universe that man has created historically. Thus man should be defined as ''animal symbolicum'' (a symbol-making or symbolizing animal). 
On this basis, Cassirer sought to understand [[human nature]] by exploring symbolic forms in all aspects of a human being's experience. His work is represented in his three-volume ''Philosophie der Symbolischen Formen'' (1923–9, translated as ''The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms'') and is summarized in his ''An Essay on Man''. [[W. J. T. Mitchell]] used this term in his essay on "representation" to say that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"man, for many philosophers both ancient and modern, is the "representational animal,"  ''homo symbolicum'' {{sic}}, the creature whose distinctive character is the creation and manipulation of signs - things that stand for or take the place of something else." &lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, T. &amp; Lentricchia, F. (1990). Critical Terms for [[Literary criticism|Literary Study]]. Chicago: [[University of Chicago|The University of Chicago]] press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Autognostics''' is a new paradigm that describes the capacity for computer networks to be self-aware. It is considered as one of the major components of [[Autonomic Networking]].

== Introduction ==
One of the most important characteristics of today’s Internet that has contributed to its success is its basic design principle: a simple and transparent core with intelligence at the edges (the so-called "end-to-end principle"). Based on this principle, the network carries data without knowing the characteristics of that data (e.g., voice, video, etc.) - only the end-points have application-specific knowledge. If something goes wrong with the data, only the edge may be able to recognize that since it knows about the application and what the expected behavior is. The core has no information about what should happen with that data - it only forwards packets.

Although an effective and beneficial attribute, this design principle has also led to many of today’s problems, limitations, and frustrations. Currently, it is almost impossible for most end-users to know why certain network-based applications do not work well and what they need to do to make it better. Also, network operators who interact with the core in low-level terms such as router configuration have problems expressing their high-level goals into low-level actions. In high-level terms, this may be summarized as a weak coupling between the network and application layers of the overall system.

As a consequence of the Internet end-to-end principle, the network performance experienced by a particular application is difficult to attribute based on the behavior of the individual elements. At any given moment, the measure of performance between any two points is typically unknown and applications must operate blindly. As a further consequence, changes to the configuration of given element, or changes in the end-to-end path, cannot easily be validated. Optimization and provisioning cannot then be automated except against only the simplest design specifications.

There is an increasing interest in [[Autonomic Networking]] research, and a strong conviction that an evolution from the current networking status quo is necessary. Although to date there have not been any practical implementations demonstrating the benefits of an effective autonomic networking paradigm, there seems to be a consensus as to the characteristics which such implementations would need to demonstrate. These specifically include continuous monitoring, identifying, diagnosing and fixing problems based on high-level policies and objectives.

Autognostics, as a major part of the autonomic networking concept, intends to bring networks to a new level of awareness and eliminate the lack of visibility which currently exists in today's networks.

== Definition ==
Autognostics is a new paradigm that describes the capacity for computer networks to be self-aware, in part and as a whole, and dynamically adapt to the applications running on them by autonomously monitoring, identifying, diagnosing, resolving issues, subsequently verifying that any remediation was successful, and reporting the impact with respect to the application’s use (i.e., providing visibility into the changes to networks and their effects).

Although similar to the concept of ''network awareness'', i.e., the capability of network devices and applications to be aware of network characteristics (see References section below), it is noteworthy that autognostics takes that concept one step further. The main difference is the ''auto'' part of autognostics, which entails that network devices are ''self''-aware of network characteristics, and have the capability to adapt ''themselves'' as a result of continuous monitoring and diagnostics.

== Path to autognostics ==
Autognostics, or in other words ''deep self-knowledge'', can be best described as ''the ability of a network to know itself and the applications that run on it''. This knowledge is used to autonomously adapt to dynamic network and application conditions such as utilization, capacity, quality of service/application/user experience, etc.

In order to achieve autognosis, networks need a means to:
* Continuously monitor/test the network for application-specific performance
* Analyze the monitoring/test data to detect problems (e.g., performance degradation)
* Diagnose, identify and localize sources of degradation
* Automatically take actions to resolve problems via remediation/provisioning
* Verify the problems have been resolved (potentially rolling back changes if ineffective)
* Subsequently continue to monitor/test for performance

'''Biomics''' is the [[biology|biological]] study of [[biome]]s, and the processing of obtained information, such as [[ecology|ecological]] [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[Soil biology|soil organism]]s.

==Uses==
Biomics is part of [[biogeography]], [[ecosystem]]s, and [[habitat]]s research. [[Ecoregion]]s are grouped into both biomes and [[ecozone]]s.

Biomics, in [[molecular biology]], uses [[bioinformatics]] to collectively analyze diverse biome data. A biome may contain very large scale [[omics]] information, such as [[metagenome]] and [[pangenome]] where [[genomic sequence]]s are mass-produced.

Elizabeth Howell, ''Space.com''. March 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; tasked to search for [[biosignature]]s and [[biomarker]]s on Mars. The rover is planned to be launched in July 2020 and [[Mars landing|land on Mars]] in March 2021.

==Overview==
The CLUPI instrument is being developed by a Swiss–French consortium supported by the [[Swiss Space Office]] and the [[French Space Agency]] (CNES). Its [[Principal Investigator]] is Jean-Luc Josset, from the Swiss Space Office in Switzerland. Frances Westall and Beda Hofmann are Co-PIs.&lt;ref name='Josset 2017'/&gt; The science team includes scientists from Canada, Europe and Russia, especially for [[biosignature]] recognition.&lt;ref name='Josset 2017'/&gt;  Instrument field tests started in 2009 with preliminary CLUPI systems tested during several Arctic winters.&lt;ref name='Josset 2017'/&gt; 

CLUPI will be mounted on the movable rover's drill box and it will acquire high-resolution, close-up images in colour of the texture, structure and morphology of rocks and soil.&lt;ref name='CLUPI home'/&gt; The resolution will be similar to what geologists would obtain by using a hand-held magnifying lens:&lt;ref name='Josset 2017'/&gt;  at a distance of 10 cm from the target, the maximum resolution is 7 µm/pixel.&lt;ref name='CLUPI home'/&gt;  Its [[field of view]] can be changed by the use of two fixed mirrors – one flat (FOV2) and one concave (FOV3). The CLUPI visual images will complement those provided by [[PanCam]] to provide the context necessary for interpretation of mineralogy and potential visible biosignatures.&lt;ref name='Josset 2017'/&gt;

CLUPI will observe the drilling area very closely from different angles to help characterise rock structures such as embedded crystals and fractures. After the drill has been used and retracted, CLUPI will be used to image the amount and appearance of dislodged fines. From the high position, the camera will be able to observe the borehole to a depth of approximately 10 cm, depending on the local illumination conditions.&lt;ref name='CLUPI home'/&gt; Then, CLUPI will be used to image the collected core prior to delivery to the rovers' internal analytical instruments for further processing and analyses. &lt;ref name='CLUPI home'/&gt;

'''Classical physics''' refers to theories of [[physics]] that predate modern, more complete, or more widely applicable theories. If a currently accepted theory is considered to be modern, and its introduction represented a major [[paradigm shift]], then the previous theories, or new theories based on the older paradigm, will often be referred to as belonging to the realm of "classical physics".

As such, the definition of a classical theory depends on context. Classical physical concepts are often used when modern theories are unnecessarily complex for a particular situation. Most usually ''classical physics'' refers to pre-1900 physics, while ''[[modern physics]]'' refers to post-1900 physics which incorporates elements of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[theory of relativity|relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Weidner and Sells, ''Elementary Modern Physics'' Preface p.iii, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
{{Classical mechanics}}
Classical theory has at least two distinct meanings in physics. In the context of [[quantum mechanics]], classical theory refers to [[theory|theories]] of physics that do not use the [[Quantization (physics)|quantisation]] [[paradigm]], which includes [[classical mechanics]] and [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morin |first=David |title=Introduction to Classical Mechanics |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780521876223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[classical field theories]], such as [[general relativity]] and [[classical electromagnetism]], are those that do not use quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barut |first=Asim O. |title=Introduction to Classical Mechanics |year=1980| origyear=1964 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |location=New York |isbn= 9780486640389}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of general and special relativity, classical theories are those that obey [[principle of relativity|Galilean relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Einstein|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Einstein|others= Robert W. Lawson |title=Relativity|year=2004|origyear=1920|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|location=New York|isbn=9780760759219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on point of view, among the branches of theory sometimes included in classical physics are variably:

* [[Classical mechanics]]
** [[Newton's laws of motion]]
** Classical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formalisms
* [[Classical electrodynamics]] ([[Maxwell's Equations]])
* Classical [[thermodynamics]]
* [[Special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]
* Classical [[chaos theory]] and [[nonlinear dynamics]]

==Comparison with modern physics==
In contrast to classical physics, "[[modern physics]]" is a slightly looser term which may refer to just [[quantum physics]] or to [[History of physics#20th century|20th and 21st century physics]] in general.  Modern physics includes [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[theory of relativity|relativity]], when applicable.

A physical system can be described by classical physics when it satisfies conditions such that the laws of classical physics are approximately valid. In practice, physical objects ranging from those larger than [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s, to objects in the macroscopic and astronomical realm, can be well-described (understood) with [[classical mechanics]]. Beginning at the atomic level and lower, the laws of classical physics break down and generally do not provide a correct description of nature. Electromagnetic fields and forces can be described well by classical electrodynamics at length scales and field strengths large enough that quantum mechanical effects are negligible. Unlike quantum physics, classical physics is generally characterized by the principle of complete [[Scientific determinism|determinism]], although deterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics do exist.

From the point of view of classical physics as being non-relativistic physics, the predictions of general and special relativity are significantly different than those of classical theories, particularly concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Traditionally, light was reconciled with classical mechanics by assuming the existence of a stationary medium through which light propagated, the [[luminiferous aether]], which was later shown not to exist.

Mathematically, classical physics equations are those in which [[Planck's constant]] does not appear. According to the [[correspondence principle]] and [[Ehrenfest's theorem]], as a system becomes larger or more massive the classical dynamics tends to emerge, with some exceptions, such as [[superfluidity]]. This is why we can usually ignore quantum mechanics when dealing with everyday objects and the classical description will suffice. However, one of the most vigorous on-going fields of research in physics is [[Decoherence#Loss of interference and the transition from quantum to classical|classical-quantum correspondence]]. This field of research is concerned with the discovery of how the laws of quantum physics give rise to classical physics found at the limit of the large scales of the classical level.

==Computer modeling and manual calculation, modern and classic comparison== 
[[File:The two physic theories without refutation at the moment.jpg|thumb|350px|A computer model would use quantum theory and relativistic theory only]] 
Today a computer performs millions of arithmetic operations in seconds to solve a classical [[differential equation]], while Newton (one of the fathers of the differential calculus) would take hours to solve the same equation by manual calculation, even if he were the discoverer of that particular equation.

Computer modeling is essential for quantum and relativistic physics. Classic physics is considered the limit of quantum mechanics for large number of particles. On the other hand, [[classic mechanics]] is derived from [[relativistic mechanics]]. For example, in many formulations from special relativity, a correction factor (v/c)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; appears, where v is the velocity of the object and c is the speed of light. For velocities much smaller than that of light, one can neglect the terms with c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and higher that appear. These formulas then reduce to the standard definitions of Newtonian kinetic energy and momentum. This is as it should be, for special relativity must agree with Newtonian mechanics at low velocities. Computer modeling has to be as real as possible.  Classical physics would introduce an error as in the [[superfluidity]] case. In order to produce reliable models of the world, we can not use classic physics.  It is true that quantum theories consume time and computer resources, and the equations of classical physics could be resorted to provide a quick solution, but such a solution would lack reliability.

Computer modeling would use only the energy criteria to determine which theory to use: relativity or quantum theory, when attempting to describe the behavior of an object. A physicist would use a classical model to provide an approximation before more exacting models are applied and those calculations proceed.

In a computer model, there is no need to use the speed of the object if classical physics is excluded.  Low energy objects would be handled by quantum theory and high energy objects by relativity theory.&lt;ref name="zurek03"&gt;Wojciech H.

'''Cognitive deficit''' or '''cognitive impairment''' is an inclusive term to describe any characteristic that acts as a barrier to [[cognition|the cognition process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coren |first=Stanley |author2=Lawrence M. Ward |author3=James T. Enns  |title=Sensation and Perception |publisher=[[Harcourt Brace]] |year=1999 |page=9 |isbn= 0-470-00226-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term may describe
* deficits in overall [[intelligence]] (as with [[intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]]),
* specific and restricted deficits in cognitive abilities (such as in [[learning disability|learning disorders]] like [[dyslexia]]),
* [[Neuropsychological assessment|neuropsychological deficits]] (such as in [[attention]], [[working memory]] or [[Executive functions|executive function]]),
* or it may describe drug-induced impairment in cognition and memory (such as that seen with [[alcohol]], [[glucocorticoids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11461709 | volume=35 | title=Corticosteroids and cognition. | journal=J Psychiatr Res | pages=127–45 | doi=10.1016/s0022-3956(01)00018-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[benzodiazepine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Kalachnik | first1 = JE. | last2 = Hanzel | first2 = TE. | last3 = Sevenich | first3 = R. | last4 = Harder | first4 = SR. | title = Benzodiazepine behavioral side effects: review and implications for individuals with mental retardation | journal = Am J Ment Retard | volume = 107 | issue = 5 | pages = 376–410 |date=Sep 2002 | pmid = 12186578 | doi = 10.1352/0895-8017(2002)107&lt;0376:BBSERA&gt;2.0.CO;2| issn = 0895-8017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
It usually refers to a durable characteristic, as opposed to [[altered level of consciousness]], which may be acute and reversible. Cognitive deficits may be [[Congenital disorder|inborn]] or caused by environmental factors such as [[acquired brain injury|brain injuries]], [[neurological disorders]], or [[mental illness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Hockenbury, Don and Sandy | title=Discovering Psychology | publisher=Worth Publishers | year=2004 | isbn=0-7167-5704-4}}{{page needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Fried, Yehuda  |author2=Joseph Agassi, | title=Paranoia: A Study in Diagnosis| publisher=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, 50 | year=1976 | isbn=90-277-0704-9}}{{page needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Older people with cognitive impairment appear to improve somewhat with [[light therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiu|first1=HL|last2=Chan|first2=PT|last3=Chu|first3=H|last4=Hsiao|first4=SS|last5=Liu|first5=D|last6=Lin|first6=CH|last7=Chou|first7=KR|title=Effectiveness of Light Therapy in Cognitively Impaired Persons: A Metaanalysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=October 2017|volume=65|issue=10|pages=2227-2234|doi=10.1111/jgs.14990|pmid=28734045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case studies ==

{{Cleanup|section|reason=most of these examples are longitudinal studies with large samples, not case studies|date=December 2015}}

There is evidence to indicate that parallel age trends have been similar over a vast amount of time, as with Schaie’s Seattle Longitudinal Study, which contained fifty years worth of data  as well as seventy years in Wechsler tests. Studies such as these{{Example needed}} have demonstrated the different patterns in age trends have two specific patterns in cognition, a constant decrease in measures of processing abilities such as reasoning, and stability followed by a steady decline for knowledge previously acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gualtieri|first=C. Thomas|author2=Johnson, Lynda G.|title=Age-related cognitive decline in patients with mood disorders|journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry|volume=32|issue=4|pages=962–967|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2007.12.030|pmid=18243461|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A twelve-year study published in 2012 researched the effects of lifestyle activities on cognitive deficit in the hopes that a long study such as this could, to some degree, help older adults to ward off cognitive decline. The study looked at verbal speed, episodic memory, and semantic memory to be influenced by physical, social, and cognitive activities. The results of the study concluded that maintenance of cognitive functions with normal aging can be maintained by keeping an active lifestyle. The results also seemed to conclude that the correlation between lifestyle activities and cognition is not a simple one, as not all cognitive abilities were related to changes in the daily activities. Therefore, further research of longitudinal design observing the matches between activities and cognitive abilities in cognitively impaired adults could be critical.&lt;ref name="Small 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=B|author2=Dixon R|author3=McArdle J|author4=Grimm K.|title=Do changes in lifestyle engagement moderate cognitive decline in normal aging? Evidence from the Victoria Longitudinal Study|journal=Neuropsychology|date=March 2012|volume=26|issue=2|pages=144–155|doi=10.1037/a0026579|pmid=22149165|pmc=3761970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longitudinal studies using brain imaging have been done in an attempt to note early signs of cognitive decline on healthy individuals before changes noticed clinically occur. In this way the study attempted to find more biomarkers for early onset of degenerative diseases.  The results from the study concluded that there are indeed patterns of brain abnormality that can be associated with brain decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=VH|author2=Resnick SM|author3=Doshi J|author4=Beason-Held LL|author5=Zhou Y|author6=Ferrucci L|author7=Wong DF|author8=Kraut MA|author9=Davatzikos C|title=Longitudinal imaging pattern analysis (SPARE-CD index) detects early structural and functional changes before cognitive decline in healthy older adults|journal=Neurobiology of Aging|volume=33|issue=12|pages=2733–45|doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2012.01.010|pmid=22365049|pmc=4023476|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cross-sectional study, researchers investigated patients with mood disorders in comparison with a control group to see if there was a difference on the effect of aging between the groups. These patients were tested with the Central Nervous System Vital Signs, a neurocognitive battery test. The study examined subjects from ages 18 to 90, noticing a sharp decline in the patients with mood disorder compared to the normal group when subjects were ages 65 and up. These declines were observed in the cognitive areas of attention, executive function, processing speed, and memory.&lt;ref name="Small 2012" /&gt;

== Other findings ==

Although one would expect cognitive decline to have major effects on [[job performance]], it seems that there is little to no correlation of health with job performance.  With the exception of cognitive-dependent jobs such as air-traffic controller, professional athlete, or other elite jobs, age does not seem to impact one’s job performance. This obviously conflicts with cognitive tests given, so the matter has been researched further.
One possible reason for this conclusion is the rare need for a person to perform at their maximum. There is a difference between typical functioning, that is&amp;nbsp;– the normal level of functioning for daily life, and maximal functioning, that is&amp;nbsp;– what cognitive tests observe as our maximum level of functioning. As the maximum cognitive ability that we are able to achieve decreases, it may not actually affect our daily lives, which only require the normal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salthouse|first=Timothy|title=Consequences of Age-Related Cognitive Declines|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=10 January 2012|volume=63|issue=1|pages=201–226|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100328|pmc=3632788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have indicated that childhood hunger might have a protective effect on cognitive decline. One possible explanation is that the onset of age-related changes in the body can be delayed by [[calorie restriction]]. Another possible explanation is the selective survival effect, as the study participants who had a childhood with hunger tend to be the healthiest of their era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barnes |first=L.

'''Earlobe fetishism''' – [[paraphilia]] in which reaching [[sexual arousal]] occurs with partner's [[earlobe]]. Usually arousal takes place while watching, touching, caressing, nibbling, licking or gentle beating partner's earlobe.

== Earlobes as an erogenous zone ==
{{Main article|Earlobe}}
[[Love]] can be expressed throughout varied ways, but scientists find that it can be simplified into three elements – desire, attractiveness and affection. Now, researchers want to identify parts of the brain responsible of our experiences perception.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;
{{cite web |title = The truth about love: it’s all just lust and earlobes.|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-truth-about-love-its-all-just-lust-and-earlobes-1278832.html |author = Charles Arthur | publisher = independent.co.uk|accessdate= 25 May 2015 | date= February 16, 1997 |language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlobes are rich in neurons and thus for certain people are an [[erogenous zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Co go podnieca? Strefy erogenne wszystkich znaków Zodiaku. (''en. What does arouse him? Erogenous zones for each zodiac sign.'')|url = http://www.ofeminin.pl/horoskopy/strefy-erogenne-d17607.html |accessdate= 24 September 2014 | date=September 24, 2014|language = pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlobe stimulation as a theme is shown in two scenes of [[The Intouchables]], in movies by [[Humphrey Bogart]] with [[Lauren Bacall]]&lt;ref name="Mädchen, was haltet ihr vom Ohrknabbern?2"&gt;
{{cite web |title = Mädchen, was haltet ihr vom Ohrknabbern? (''en.

&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite web |title = Nibble my earloop... now (Diplomatic Immunity) |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hybDzo5nOFg |accessdate= 22 July 2015 | date= January 14, 2010 |publisher = YouTube |pages = 0:00:34-00:01:15 |language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The kissing of earlobes and its surroundings ===
A [[kiss]] on the ear is sometimes the first expression of a man's desire.&lt;ref name="9. Ohrenkuss"&gt;{{cite web |title = 9. Ohrenkuss (''en. 9.

While kissing, sexual partners usually limit themselves to the mouth and forget about ears. To create further stimuli, some may place (fast and tiny) kisses up throughout the jawbone to the place where the earlobe binds with the skin behind the jawbone.&lt;ref group="Sex"&gt;The cited source suggests focus under the earlobe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kiss the Ears!"&gt;{{cite web |title = Kiss the Ears!|url = http://www.getromantic.com/passion/better_kisser/kiss_the_ears.html | author = Kristy Yorkel |accessdate= June 10, 2015 | date= 1 January 2009 |publisher = getromantic.com |language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Moisturising the tip of tongue and tracing around the earlobe edge.
* Rapidly flicking the tongue on the outer surface of earlobe, the lower surface, and its edge.
* Holding the earlobe with lips immediately before nibbling it gently.
* Gently nibbling the earlobe with [[incisor]]s.
* Slowly pulling the earlobe downwards until it slips out from the lips or teeth.
* Gently blowing on wet skin.&lt;ref group="Sex"&gt;It triggers feelings of tingling and coolness.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Sex"&gt;Avoid directing the stream of air into the [[ear canal]]; it can cause pain.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Drawing-in air instead of blowing.&lt;ref group="Sex"&gt;It triggers a feeling of warmth.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Running the tongue throughout the inner ear edge, outer edge and between them.
* Whispering loving words.

To make the stimulation of the earlobes more intensive, one may "tickle it with tongue during embrace earlobe between incisors or make [[pelvic thrust]] when we pull earlobe with our lips {{sic|?}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = 20 sortes de baisers différents: 5.

=== Effects accompanying sexual arousal ===
It is known that numerous capillaries are crucial for erotic function of earlobes. During [[sexual arousal]] and [[sexual intercourse]] artery pressure significantly increases. Due to this, blood presses stronger on capillary walls, which increase in diameter. Summary effects of the enlarging diameter of capillaries is visible as:&lt;ref name="The Sexual Response Cycle"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Sexual Response Cycle |url= http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:nybaMSm-alMJ:ww2.justanswer.de/uploads/bernpata/2009-07-27_041027_When_Masters_and_Johnson.doc+&amp;cd=12&amp;hl=pl&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=pl |publisher= Cleveland clinic |publication-date= 2008 |access-date= 2015-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pinkness or redness of earlobes
* [[Tumescence]] of earlobes

=== Arguments against treating earlobes as an erogenous zone ===
Some people view ears only as a physiological organ that should not be connoted with the sexual sphere. Disgust to adoring earlobes or ears as a whole is linked with hygiene of this body part.&lt;ref group="Sex"&gt;[[Earwax]] occurs in the ear canal, which is close to the earlobe, and (in trace amounts) on the earlobe's surface.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also linked with partners' tendency to salivate.&lt;ref name="Mädchen, was haltet ihr vom Ohrknabbern?2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1730">The '''European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion''', briefly '''ESPON''', is a European funded programme under the objective of "European Territorial Cooperation" of the Cohesion Policy of the European Union. It is co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund - [[Interreg]]. 

The mission of the programme is to support policy development in relation to the aim of territorial cohesion and a harmonious development of the [[Europe]]an territory. Firstly it provides comparable information, evidence, analyses and scenarios on territorial dynamics and secondly it reveals territorial capital and potentials for the development of regions and larger territories thus contributing to European competitiveness, territorial cooperation and a sustainable and balanced development.

The current ESPON 2020 Programme is carried through by 28 [[European Union]] Member States as well as [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]] and the [[European Commission]].

A '''film''', also called a '''movie''', '''motion picture''', '''moving picture''', '''theatrical film''', or '''photoplay''', is a series of still images that, when shown on a [[Projection screen|screen]], create the illusion of moving images. (See the [[glossary of motion picture terms]].)

This [[optical illusion]] causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed in rapid succession. The process of [[filmmaking]] is both an [[art film|art]] and an [[film industry|industry]]. A film is created by [[photography|photographing]] actual scenes with a [[movie camera|motion-picture camera]], by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional [[animation]] techniques, by means of [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and [[computer animation]], or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other [[visual effects]].

The word "'''cinema'''", short for [[cinematography]], is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art of filmmaking itself. The contemporary definition of cinema is the art of simulating experiences to communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along with other sensory stimulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribecafilm.com/future-of-film/future-of-the-movie-theater-is-in-your-mind|title=The Movie Theater of the Future Will Be In Your Mind|last=Severny|first=Andrei|date=2013-09-05|work=[[Tribeca Film Festival|Tribeca]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907214603/http://tribecafilm.com/future-of-film/future-of-the-movie-theater-is-in-your-mind|archivedate=September 7, 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=September 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films were originally recorded onto plastic film through a [[Photographic film|photochemical]] process and then shown through a [[movie projector]] onto a large screen. Contemporary films are now often [[Digital recording|fully digital]] through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition, while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous [[sound-on-film|optical soundtrack]] (a graphic [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] of the spoken words, music and other [[sound]]s that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and is not projected).

Films are [[cultural artifact]]s created by specific [[culture]]s. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important [[art]] form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for [[documentary film|educating]]—or [[propaganda film|indoctrinating]]—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] to [[translation|translate]] the dialog into other languages.

The individual images that make up a film are called [[Film frame|frames]]. In the projection of traditional celluloid films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame, in turn, is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as [[persistence of vision]], whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears. The perception of motion is due to a psychological effect called the [[phi phenomenon]].

The name "film" originates from the fact that [[photographic film]] (also called [[film stock]]) has historically been the [[Recording medium|medium]] for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture, including ''picture'', ''picture show'', ''moving picture'', ''photoplay'', and ''flick''. The most common term in the [[United States]] is ''movie'', while in [[Europe]] ''film'' is preferred. Common terms for the field in general include ''the big screen'', ''the silver screen'', ''the movies'', and ''cinema''; the last of these is commonly used, as an overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical essays. In early years, the word ''sheet'' was sometimes used instead of ''screen''.

== History ==
{{Main|History of film}}
[[File:LouisLePrinceFirstFilmEver RoundhayGardenScene.png|thumb|left|alt=A screenshot of Roundhay Garden Scene by the French Louis Le Prince, the world's first film|A frame from ''[[Roundhay Garden Scene]]'', the world's earliest surviving film produced using a motion picture camera, by [[Louis Le Prince]], 1888.]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1988-035-15, Berlin, Wintergarten.jpg|thumb|alt=Berlin Wintergarten theatre, vaudeville stage at the Berlin Conservatory from the 1940s|The [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre]] was the site of the first [[Movie theater|cinema]] ever, with a [[short film]] presented by the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]] on 1 November 1895. (Pictured here is a [[variety show]] at the theater in July 1940.)]]

===Preceding technologies===
Preceding film in origin by thousands of years, early [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[dances]] had elements common to film: [[Script (performing arts)|scripts]], [[Set construction|sets]], [[costumes]], [[Filmmaking#Production|production]], [[Film director|direction]], [[actors]], [[audiences]], [[storyboards]] and [[Film score|scores]]. Much terminology later used in film theory and criticism apply, such as [[mise en scène]] (roughly, the entire visual picture at any one time). Owing to the lack of any technology for doing so, the moving images and sounds could not be recorded for replaying as with film.

The [[magic lantern]], probably created by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in the 1650s, could be used to project [[animation]], which was achieved by various types of mechanical slides. Typically, two glass slides, one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that was to move, would be placed one on top of the other and projected together, then the moving slide would be hand-operated, either directly or by means of a lever or other mechanism. Chromotrope slides, which produced eye-dazzling displays of continuously cycling abstract geometrical patterns and colors, were operated by means of a small crank and pulley wheel that rotated a glass disc.&lt;ref name="Barber, Theodore X. 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barber | first1 = Theodore X | year = 1989 | title = Phantasmagorical Wonders: The Magic Lantern Ghost Show in Nineteenth-Century America | url = | journal = Film History | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 73–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century, inventions such as [[Joseph Plateau]]'s [[phenakistoscope]] and the later [[zoetrope]] demonstrated that a carefully designed sequence of drawings, showing phases of the changing appearance of objects in motion, would appear to show the objects actually moving if they were displayed one after the other at a sufficiently rapid rate. These devices relied on the phenomenon of [[persistence of vision]] to make the display appear continuous even though the observer's view was actually blocked as each drawing rotated into the location where its predecessor had just been glimpsed. Each sequence was limited to a small number of drawings, usually twelve, so it could only show endlessly repeating cyclical motions. By the late 1880s, the last major device of this type, the [[praxinoscope]], had been elaborated into a form that employed a long coiled band containing hundreds of images painted on glass and used the elements of a [[magic lantern]] to project them onto a screen.

The use of sequences of [[photography|photographs]] in such devices was initially limited to a few experiments with subjects photographed in a series of poses because the available [[photographic emulsion|emulsions]] were not sensitive enough to allow the short [[exposure (photography)|exposures]] needed to photograph subjects that were actually moving. The sensitivity was gradually improved and in the late 1870s, [[Eadweard Muybridge]] created the first animated image sequences photographed in real-time. A row of cameras was used, each, in turn, capturing one image on a [[photographic plate|photographic glass plate]], so the total number of images in each sequence was limited by the number of cameras, about two dozen at most. Muybridge used his system to analyze the movements of a wide variety of animal and human subjects. Hand-painted images based on the photographs were projected as moving images by means of his [[zoopraxiscope]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Alan Larson (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ESVZOghoi6kC&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=Eadweard%20Muybridge%20horse%20-%20english%20photographer Republic of images: a history of French filmmaking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428103430/https://books.google.com/books?id=ESVZOghoi6kC&amp;pg=PA17 |date=2016-04-28 }} Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===First motion pictures===
By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of [[celluloid]] [[photographic film]] and the invention of [[Movie camera|motion picture cameras]], which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact [[reel]] of film. Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a "peep show" device such as the [[Kinetoscope]] and the [[mutoscope]]. Others were intended for a [[movie projector|projector]], mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these "moving pictures" could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience. The first kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition was [[Blacksmith Scene]], produced by [[Edison Manufacturing Company]] in 1893. The following year the company would begin [[Edison Studios]], which became an early leader in the film industry with notable early shorts including [[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]], and would go on to produce close to 1,200 films.

The first public screenings of films at which admission was charged were made in 1895 by the American [[Woodville Latham]] and his sons, using films produced by their company, and by the – arguably better known – French brothers [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] with ten of their own productions.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Private screenings had preceded these by several months, with Latham's slightly predating the Lumière brothers'.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Another opinion is that the first public exhibition of projected motion pictures in America was at [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University|Brooklyn Institute]] in [[New York City]] 9 May 1893.

===Early evolution===
The earliest films were simply one static [[Shot (filming)|shot]] that showed an event or action with no [[Film editing|editing]] or other [[cinematic technique]]s. Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several [[Scene (filming)|scenes]] together to tell a story. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until [[sound film]] became commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely [[visual arts|visual art]], but these innovative [[silent film]]s had gained a hold on the public imagination. Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment, theater owners hired a [[piano|pianist]] or [[organ (music)|organist]] or, in large urban theaters, a full [[orchestra]] to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose, and complete [[film score]]s were composed for major productions.

[[File:Charlie Chaplin, the Marriage Bond.ogg|thumb|alt=A clip from the Charlie Chaplin silent film, The Bond from 1918 Motion Picture Division of the U.S. National Archives|A clip from the [[Charlie Chaplin]] silent film ''[[The Bond]]'' (1918)]]

The rise of European cinema was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War I]], while the film industry in the United States flourished with the rise of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], typified most prominently by the innovative work of [[D. W. Griffith]] in [[The Birth of a Nation]] (1915) and [[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]] (1916). However, in the 1920s, European filmmakers such as [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau|F. W. Murnau]] and [[Fritz Lang]], in many ways inspired by the meteoric wartime progress of film through Griffith, along with the contributions of [[Charles Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]] and others, quickly caught up with American film-making and continued to further advance the medium.

===Sound===
In the 1920s, the development of electronic [[sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] technologies made it practical to incorporate a [[soundtrack]] of speech, music and [[sound effects]] synchronized with the action on the screen.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The resulting [[sound film]]s were initially distinguished from the usual silent "moving pictures" or "movies" by calling them "talking pictures" or "talkies."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The revolution they wrought was swift. By 1930, silent film was practically extinct in the US and already being referred to as "the old medium."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Colour===
Another major technological development was the introduction of "[[color motion picture film|natural color]]," which meant color that was photographically recorded from nature rather than added to black-and-white prints by hand-coloring, stencil-coloring or other arbitrary procedures, although the earliest processes typically yielded colors which were far from "natural" in appearance.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} While the advent of sound films quickly made silent films and theater musicians obsolete, color replaced black-and-white much more gradually.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The pivotal innovation was the introduction of the three-strip version of the [[Technicolor]] process, first used for animated cartoons in 1932, then also for live-action [[short film]]s and isolated sequences in a few [[feature film]]s, then for an entire feature film, ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'', in 1935. The expense of the process was daunting, but favorable public response in the form of increased [[box office]] receipts usually justified the added cost. The number of films made in color slowly increased year after year.

===1950s developments===
In the early 1950s, the proliferation of black-and-white television started seriously depressing North American theater attendance.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In an attempt to lure audiences back into theaters, bigger screens were installed, [[widescreen]] processes, [[polarized 3D system|polarized 3D projection]], and [[stereophonic sound]] were introduced, and more films were made in color, which soon became the rule rather than the exception. Some important mainstream Hollywood films were still being made in black-and-white as late as the mid-1960s, but they marked the end of an era. Color television receivers had been available in the US since the mid-1950s, but at first, they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in color. During the 1960s, prices gradually came down, color broadcasts became common, and sales boomed. The overwhelming public verdict in favor of color was clear. After the final flurry of black-and-white films had been released in mid-decade, all Hollywood studio productions were filmed in color, with rare exceptions reluctantly made only at the insistence of "star" directors such as [[Peter Bogdanovich]] and [[Martin Scorsese]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===1960s and later===
The decades following the decline of the [[studio system]] in the 1960s saw changes in the production and style of film. Various New Wave movements (including the [[French New Wave]], [[Parallel Cinema|Indian New Wave]], [[Japanese New Wave]], and [[New Hollywood]]) and the rise of film-school-educated independent filmmakers contributed to the changes the medium experienced in the latter half of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Digital technology has been the driving force for change throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. Digital 3D projection largely replaced earlier problem-prone 3D film systems and has become popular in the early 2010s.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Film theory==
[[File:BolexH16.jpg|right|thumb|alt=16 mm spring-wound Bolex H16 Reflex camera|This [[16 mm film|16 mm]] spring-wound [[Bolex]] "H16" Reflex camera is a popular entry level camera used in [[film school]]s.]]
"Film theory" seeks to develop concise and systematic concepts that apply to the study of film as [[art]]. The concept of film as an art-form began with [[Ricciotto Canudo]]'s ''The Birth of the Sixth Art''. [[Formalist film theory]], led by [[Rudolf Arnheim]], [[Béla Balázs]], and [[Siegfried Kracauer]], emphasized how film differed from reality and thus could be considered a valid [[fine art]]. [[André Bazin]] reacted against this theory by arguing that film's artistic essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality, not in its differences from reality, and this gave rise to realist theory. More recent analysis spurred by [[Jacques Lacan]]'s psychoanalysis and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s [[semiotics]] among other things has given rise to [[psychoanalytic film theory]], [[structuralist film theory]], [[feminist film theory]], and others. On the other hand, critics from the [[analytical philosophy]] tradition, influenced by [[Wittgenstein]], try to clarify misconceptions used in theoretical studies and produce analysis of a film's vocabulary and its link to a [[Form of life (philosophy)|form of life]].

===Language===
Film is considered to have its own [[language]]. [[James Monaco]] wrote a classic text on film theory, titled "How to ''Read'' a Film," that addresses this. Director [[Ingmar Bergman]] famously said, "[[Andrei Tarkovsky]] for me is the greatest [[Film director|director]], the one who invented a ''new language'', true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream." An example of the language is a sequence of back and forth images of one speaking actor's left profile, followed by another speaking actor's right profile, then a repetition of this, which is a language understood by the audience to indicate a conversation. This describes another theory of film, the [[180-degree rule]], as a visual story-telling device with an ability to place a viewer in a context of being psychologically present through the use of visual composition and editing. The "[[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood style]]" includes this narrative theory, due to the overwhelming practice of the rule by movie studios based in Hollywood, California, during film's classical era. Another example of cinematic language is having a shot that zooms in on the forehead of an actor with an expression of silent reflection that cuts to a shot of a younger actor who vaguely resembles the first actor, indicating that the first person is remembering a past self, an edit of compositions that causes a time transition.

===Montage===
{{Main|Montage (filmmaking)|l1=Montage}}
Montage is the technique by which separate pieces of film are selected, edited, and then pieced together to make a new section of film. A scene could show a man going into battle, with flashbacks to his youth and to his home-life and with added special effects, placed into the film after filming is complete. As these were all filmed separately, and perhaps with different actors, the final version is called a montage. Directors developed a theory of montage, beginning with [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] and the complex juxtaposition of images in his film ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]''.&lt;ref name=JNFilmtheory&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelmes|first=Jill|title=An introduction to film studies|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-26269-9|page=394|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jcCADouuE_UC&amp;pg=PA394&amp;q=montage|edition=3rd ed., Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporation of musical and visual [[counterpoint]], and scene development through [[mise en scene]], [[editing]], and effects has led to more complex techniques comparable to those used in [[opera]] and [[ballet]].

===Film criticism===
{{Main|Film criticism}}

Film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films. In general, these works can be divided into two categories: academic criticism by film scholars and journalistic film criticism that appears regularly in [[newspaper]]s and other media. Film critics working for newspapers, [[magazine]]s, and [[broadcast media]] mainly review new releases. Normally they only see any given film once and have only a day or two to formulate their opinions. Despite this, critics have an important impact on the audience response and attendance at films, especially those of certain [[film genre|genres]]. Mass marketed [[action film|action]], [[horror film|horror]], and [[comedy film]]s tend not to be greatly affected by a critic's overall judgment of a film. The plot summary and description of a film and the assessment of the director's and screenwriters' work that makes up the majority of most film reviews can still have an important impact on whether people decide to see a film. For prestige films such as most [[drama film|dramas]] and [[art film]]s, the influence of reviews is important. Poor reviews from leading critics at major papers and magazines will often reduce audience interest and attendance.

The impact of a reviewer on a given film's [[box office]] performance is a matter of debate. Some observers claim that [[movie marketing]] in the 2000s is so intense, well-coordinated and well financed that reviewers cannot prevent a poorly written or filmed [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] from attaining market success. However, the cataclysmic failure of some heavily promoted films which were harshly reviewed, as well as the unexpected success of critically praised independent films indicates that extreme critical reactions can have considerable influence. Other observers note that positive film reviews have been shown to spark interest in little-known films. Conversely, there have been several films in which film companies have so little confidence that they refuse to give reviewers an advanced viewing to avoid widespread panning of the film. However, this usually backfires, as reviewers are wise to the tactic and warn the public that the film may not be worth seeing and the films often do poorly as a result. Journalist film critics are sometimes called film reviewers. Critics who take a more academic approach to films, through publishing in film journals and writing books about films using [[film theory]] or [[film studies]] approaches, study how film and filming techniques work, and what effect they have on people. Rather than having their reviews published in newspapers or appearing on television, their articles are published in scholarly journals or up-market magazines. They also tend to be affiliated with colleges or universities as professors or instructors.

==Industry==
{{World Cinema}}
{{Main|Film industry}}
[[File:Filmstudio Babelsberg Eingang.jpg|thumb|alt=Babelsberg Studio near Berlin gate with pedestrian island|Founded in 1912, the [[Babelsberg Studio]] near [[Berlin]] was the first large-scale film studio in the world, and the forerunner to [[Hollywood]]. It still produces global blockbusters every year.]]
The making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as soon as the process was invented. Upon seeing how successful their new invention, and its product, was in their native France, the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumières]] quickly set about touring the Continent to exhibit the first films privately to royalty and publicly to the masses. In each country, they would normally add new, local scenes to their catalogue and, quickly enough, found local entrepreneurs in the various countries of Europe to buy their equipment and photograph, export, import, and screen additional product commercially. The [[Oberammergau Passion Play]] of 1898{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} was the first commercial motion picture ever produced. Other pictures soon followed, and motion pictures became a separate industry that overshadowed the vaudeville world. Dedicated [[movie theater|theaters]] and companies formed specifically to produce and distribute films, while motion picture actors became major [[celebrity|celebrities]] and commanded huge fees for their performances. By 1917 [[Charlie Chaplin]] had a contract that called for an annual salary of one million dollars. From 1931 to 1956, film was also the only image storage and playback system for [[television programming]] until the introduction of [[videotape recorder]]s.

In the United States, much of the film industry is centered around [[Hollywood, California]]. Other regional centers exist in many parts of the world, such as [[Mumbai]]-centered [[Bollywood]], the [[Cinema of India|Indian film industry's]] [[Hindi]] cinema which produces the largest number of films in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/04/07/india.sexywood/index.html Bollywood Hots Up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307024113/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/04/07/india.sexywood/index.html |date=2008-03-07 }} cnn.com. Retrieved June 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the expense involved in making films has led cinema production to concentrate under the auspices of [[movie studio]]s, recent advances in affordable film making equipment have allowed independent film productions to flourish.

Profit is a key force in the industry, due to the costly and risky nature of filmmaking; many films have large [[cost overruns]], an example being [[Kevin Costner]]'s ''[[Waterworld]]''. Yet many filmmakers strive to create works of lasting social significance. The [[Academy Awards]] (also known as "the Oscars") are the most prominent film awards in the [[United States]], providing recognition each year to films, based on their artistic merits. There is also a large industry for educational and instructional films made in lieu of or in addition to lectures and texts. Revenue in the industry is sometimes volatile due to the reliance on [[blockbuster film]]s released in [[movie theater]]s. The rise of alternative home entertainment has raised questions about the future of the cinema industry, and Hollywood employment has become less reliable, particularly for medium and low-budget films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christopherson|first=Susan|date=2013-03-01|title=Hollywood in decline?

==Associated fields==
{{Further|Film theory|Product placement|Propaganda}}
Derivative academic fields of study may both interact with and develop independently of filmmaking, as in [[film theory]] and analysis. Fields of academic study have been created that are derivative or dependent on the existence of film, such as [[film criticism]], [[film history]], divisions of [[film propaganda]] in authoritarian governments, or psychological on subliminal effects (e.g., of a flashing soda can during a screening). These fields may further create derivative fields, such as a [[movie review]] section in a newspaper or a television guide. Sub-industries can spin off from film, such as popcorn makers, and film-related toys (e.g., [[Star Wars action figures|''Star Wars'' figures]]). Sub-industries of pre-existing industries may deal specifically with film, such as [[product placement]] and other [[advertising]] within films.

==Terminology==
The terminology used for describing motion pictures varies considerably between [[British and American English]]. In British usage, the name of the medium is "film". The word "movie" is understood but seldom used.&lt;ref name="britam"&gt;{{cite web|title=British English/American English Vocabulary|url=https://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/british-american.htm|accessdate=26 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621191145/http://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/british-american.htm|archivedate=21 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sdope"&gt;{{cite web|title=British English vs. U.S. English – film vs. movie|url=http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=363802|work=Straight Dope Message Board|accessdate=26 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110091840/http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=363802|archivedate=10 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, "the pictures" (plural) is used semi-frequently to refer to the place where movies are exhibited, while in American English this may be called "the movies", but it is becoming outdated. In other countries, the place where movies are exhibited may be called a cinema or [[movie theatre]]. By contrast, in the United States, "movie" is the predominant form. Although the words "film" and "movie" are sometimes used interchangeably, "film" is more often used when considering [[artistic]], [[theoretical]], or [[technology|technical]] aspects. The term "movies" more often refers to [[entertainment]] or [[Commerce|commercial]] aspects, as where to go for fun evening on a date. For example, a book titled "How to Understand a Film" would probably be about the aesthetics or theory of film, while a book entitled "Let's Go to the Movies" would probably be about the history of entertaining movies and [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]].

Further terminology is used to distinguish various forms and media used in the film industry. "Motion pictures" and "moving pictures" are frequently used terms for film and movie productions specifically intended for theatrical exhibition, such as, for instance, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''. "[[DVD]]" and "[[videotape]]" are video formats that can reproduce a photochemical film. A reproduction based on such is called a "transfer." After the advent of theatrical film as an industry, the television industry began using videotape as a recording medium. For many decades, tape was solely an analog medium onto which moving images could be either recorded or transferred. "Film" and "filming" refer to the photochemical medium that chemically records a visual image and the act of recording respectively. However, the act of shooting images with other visual media, such as with a digital camera, is still called "filming" and the resulting works often called "films" as interchangeable to "movies," despite not being shot on film. "[[Silent films]]" need not be utterly silent, but are films and movies without an audible dialogue, including those that have a musical accompaniment. The word, "[[Talkies]]," refers to the earliest sound films created to have [[Hearing (sense)|audible]] [[dialogue]] recorded for playback along with the film, regardless of a musical accompaniment. "Cinema" either broadly encompasses both films and movies, or it is roughly synonymous with film and theatrical exhibition, and both are capitalized when referring to a category of art. The "[[silver screen]]" refers to the projection screen used to exhibit films and, by extension, is also used as a [[metonym]] for the entire film industry.

"[[Widescreen]]" refers to a larger width to height in the [[film frame|frame]], compared to earlier historic [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]s.&lt;ref name="imdbmovietermsw"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/glossary/W |title=Movie Terminology Glossary: W |work= |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722052010/http://www.imdb.com/glossary/W |archivedate=2010-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A "feature-length film", or "[[feature film]]", is of a conventional full length, usually 60 minutes or more, and can commercially stand by itself without other films in a ticketed screening.&lt;ref name="imdbmovietermsf"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/glossary/F |title=Movie Terminology Glossary: F |work= |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722051945/http://www.imdb.com/glossary/F |archivedate=2010-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A "[[short subject|short]]" is a film that is not as long as a feature-length film, often screened with other shorts, or preceding a feature-length film. An "[[Independent film|independent]]" is a film made outside the conventional film industry.

In US usage, one talks of a "[[Film screening|screening]]" or "[[Movie projector|projection]]" of a movie or video on a [[Projection screen|screen]] at a public or private "theater." In British English, a "film showing" happens at a [[movie theatre|cinema]] (never a "[[theatre]]", which is a different medium and place altogether).&lt;ref name="sdope" /&gt; A cinema usually refers to an arena designed specifically to exhibit films, where the screen is affixed to a wall, while a theater usually refers to a place where live, non-recorded action or combination thereof occurs from a podium or other type of stage, including the amphitheater. Theaters can still screen movies in them, though the theater would be retrofitted to do so. One might propose "going to the cinema" when referring to the activity, or sometimes "to the pictures" in British English, whereas the US expression is usually "going to the movies." A cinema usually shows a mass-marketed movie using a front-projection screen process with either a film projector or, more recently, with a digital projector. But, cinemas may also show theatrical movies from their home video transfers that include Blu-ray Disc, DVD, and videocassette when they possess sufficient projection quality or based upon need, such as movies that exist only in their transferred state, which may be due to the loss or deterioration of the film master and prints from which the movie originally existed. Due to the advent of [[digital cinema|digital film production and distribution]], physical film might be absent entirely. A "[[double feature]]" is a screening of two independently marketed, stand-alone feature films. A "viewing" is a watching of a film. "[[Sales]]" and "at the box office" refer to tickets sold at a theater, or more currently, rights sold for individual showings. A "[[Film release|release]]" is the distribution and often simultaneous screening of a film. A "[[preview (theatre)|preview]]" is a screening in advance of the main release.

Any film may also have a "[[sequel]]", which portrays events following those in the film. ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' is an early example. When there are more films than one with the same characters, story arcs, or subject themes, these movies become a "series," such as the [[James Bond]] series. And, existing outside a specific story timeline usually, does not exclude a film from being part of a series. A film that portrays events occurring earlier in a timeline with those in another film, but is released after that film, is sometimes called a "[[prequel]]," an example being ''[[Butch and Sundance: The Early Days]]''.

The "credits," or "end credits," is a list that gives credit to the people involved in the production of a film. Films from before the 1970s usually start a film with credits, often ending with only a title card, saying "The End" or some equivalent, often an equivalent that depends on the language of the production{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. From then onward, a film's credits usually appear at the end of most films. However, films with credits that end a film often repeat some credits at or near the start of a film and therefore appear twice, such as that film's acting leads, while less frequently some appearing near or at the beginning only appear there, not at the end, which often happens to the director's credit. The credits appearing at or near the beginning of a film are usually called "titles" or "beginning titles." A [[post-credits scene]] is a scene shown after the end of the credits. ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' has a post-credit scene in which Ferris tells the audience that the film is over and they should go home.

A film's "cast" refers to a collection of the actors and actresses who appear, or "star," in a film. A star is an actor or actress, often a popular one, and in many cases, a [[celebrity]] who plays a central character in a film. Occasionally the word can also be used to refer to the fame of other members of the crew, such as a director or other personality, such as [[Martin Scorsese]]. A "crew" is usually interpreted as the people involved in a film's physical construction outside cast participation, and it could include directors, film editors, photographers, grips, gaffers, set decorators, prop masters, and costume designers. A person can both be part of a film's cast and crew, such as [[Woody Allen]], who directed and starred in ''[[Take the Money and Run]]''.

A "film goer," "movie goer," or "film buff" is a person who likes or often attends films and movies, and any of these, though more often the latter, could also see oneself as a student to films and movies or the filmic process. Intense interest in films, film theory, and film criticism, is known as [[cinephilia]]. A film enthusiast is known as a cinephile or cineaste.

===Preview===
{{main|Test screening}}
A preview performance refers to a showing of a film to a select audience, usually for the purposes of corporate promotions, before the public film premiere itself. Previews are sometimes used to judge audience reaction, which if unexpectedly negative, may result in recutting or even refilming certain sections based on the [[audience response]]. One example of a film that was changed after a negative response from the test screening is 1982's ''[[First Blood]]''. After the test audience responded very negatively to the death of protagonist [[John Rambo]], a [[Vietnam veteran]], at the end of the film, the company wrote and re-shot a new ending in which the character survives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/bp/first-blood-turns-30-rambo-original-dark-end-174610790.html|title='First Blood' Turns 30: Rambo's original dark end|location=[[Yahoo!

===Trailer and teaser===
{{main|Film trailer}}

Trailers or previews are advertisements for films that will be shown in 1 to 3 months at a cinema. Back in the early days of cinema, with theaters that had only one or two screens, only certain trailers were shown for the films that were going to be shown there. Later, when theaters added more screens or new theaters were built with a lot of screens, all different trailers were shown even if they weren't going to play that film in that theater. Film studios realized that the more trailers that were shown (even if it wasn't going to be shown in that particular theater) the more patrons would go to a different theater to see the film when it came out. The term "trailer" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a film program. That practice did not last long because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film (or the "A film" in a [[double feature]] program) begins. Film trailers are also common on [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Trailers are created to be engaging and interesting for viewers. As a result, in the Internet era, viewers often seek out trailers to watch them. Of the ten billion videos watched online annually in 2008, film trailers ranked third, after news and user-created videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://awfj.org/2008/05/07/awfj-opinion-poll-all-about-movie-trailers/ | title = AWFJ Opinion Poll: All About Movie Trailers | publisher = AWFJ | date = 2008-05-09 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011641/http://awfj.org/2008/05/07/awfj-opinion-poll-all-about-movie-trailers/ | archivedate = 2013-12-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teasers are a much shorter preview or advertisement that lasts only 10 to 30 seconds. Teasers are used to get patrons excited about a film coming out in the next six to twelve months. Teasers may be produced even before the film production is completed.

==Education and propaganda==
{{Main|Educational film|Propaganda film}}

Film is used for a range of goals, including education and propaganda. When the purpose is primarily educational, a film is called an "[[educational film]]". Examples are recordings of academic lectures and experiments, or a film based on a classic novel. Film may be [[propaganda film|propaganda]], in whole or in part, such as the films made by [[Leni Riefenstahl]] in Nazi Germany, US war film trailers during World War II, or artistic films made under Stalin by [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]. They may also be works of political protest, as in the films of [[Andrzej Wajda]], or more subtly, the films of [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]. The same film may be considered educational by some, and propaganda by others as the categorization of a film can be subjective.

== Production ==
{{Main|Filmmaking}}

At its core, the means to produce a film depend on the content the filmmaker wishes to show, and the apparatus for displaying it: the [[zoetrope]] merely requires a series of images on a strip of paper. Film production can, therefore, take as little as one person with a camera (or even without a camera, as in [[Stan Brakhage]]'s 1963 film ''[[Mothlight]]''), or thousands of actors, extras, and crew members for a live-action, feature-length epic.

The necessary steps for almost any film can be boiled down to conception, planning, execution, revision, and distribution. The more involved the production, the more significant each of the steps becomes. In a typical [[production cycle]] of a Hollywood-style film, these main stages are defined as [[Script development|development]], [[pre-production]], [[Film production|production]], [[post-production]] and [[Film distributor|distribution]].

This production cycle usually takes three years. The first year is taken up with ''development''. The second year comprises ''preproduction'' and ''production''. The third year, ''post-production'' and ''distribution''. The bigger the production, the more resources it takes, and the more important [[Film budgeting|financing]] becomes; most [[feature film]]s are artistic works from the creators' perspective (e.g., [[film director]], [[cinematographer]], [[screenwriter]]) and for-profit business entities for the production companies.

===Crew===
{{Main|Film crew}}

A film crew is a group of people hired by a film company, employed during the "production" or "photography" phase, for the purpose of producing a film or motion picture. ''Crew'' is distinguished from ''cast'', who are the [[actor]]s who appear in front of the [[camera]] or provide voices for characters in the film. The ''crew'' interacts with but is also distinct from the ''production staff'', consisting of producers, managers, company representatives, their assistants, and those whose primary responsibility falls in pre-production or post-production phases, such as [[screenwriter]]s and [[film editor]]s. Communication between ''production'' and ''crew'' generally passes through the director and his/her staff of assistants. Medium-to-large crews are generally divided into departments with well-defined hierarchies and standards for interaction and cooperation between the departments. Other than acting, the crew handles everything in the photography phase: props and costumes, shooting, sound, electrics (i.e., lights), sets, and production special effects. [[Caterer]]s (known in the film industry as "craft services") are usually not considered part of the crew.

===Technology===
{{see also|Cinematic techniques}}
[[Film stock]] consists of transparent [[celluloid]], [[acetate]], or [[polyester]] [[film base|base]] coated with an emulsion containing light-sensitive chemicals. Cellulose nitrate was the first type of film base used to record motion pictures, but due to its flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials. Stock widths and the [[film format]] for images on the reel have had a rich history, though most large commercial films are still shot on (and distributed to theaters) as [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]] prints.
Originally moving picture film was shot and projected at various speeds using hand-cranked [[movie camera|cameras]] and [[movie projector|projectors]]; though 1000 frames per minute (16{{sfrac|2|3}} frame/s) is generally cited as a standard silent speed, research indicates most films were shot between 16 frame/s and 23 frame/s and projected from 18 frame/s on up (often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should be shown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_car_1.htm |title=Silent Film Speed |publisher=Cinemaweb.com |date=1911-12-02 |accessdate=2010-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407224839/http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_car_1.htm |archivedate=April 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[sound film]] was introduced in the late 1920s, a constant speed was required for the sound head. 24 frames per second were chosen because it was the slowest (and thus cheapest) speed which allowed for sufficient sound quality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} Improvements since the late 19th century include the mechanization of cameras&amp;nbsp;– allowing them to record at a consistent speed, quiet camera design&amp;nbsp;– allowing sound recorded on-set to be usable without requiring large "blimps" to encase the camera, the invention of more sophisticated [[film stock|filmstocks]] and [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], allowing [[Film director|directors]] to film in increasingly dim conditions, and the development of synchronized sound, allowing sound to be recorded at exactly the same speed as its corresponding action. The soundtrack can be recorded separately from shooting the film, but for live-action pictures, many parts of the soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously.

As a medium, film is not limited to motion pictures, since the technology developed as the basis for [[photography]]. It can be used to present a progressive sequence of still images in the form of a slideshow. Film has also been incorporated into [[multimedia]] presentations and often has importance as primary historical documentation. However, historic films have problems in terms of preservation and storage, and the motion picture industry is exploring many alternatives. Most films on cellulose nitrate base have been copied onto modern safety films. Some studios save color films through the use of [[separation masters]]: three B&amp;W negatives each exposed through red, green, or blue filters (essentially a reverse of the [[Technicolor]] process). Digital methods have also been used to restore films, although their continued obsolescence cycle makes them (as of 2006) a poor choice for long-term preservation. [[Film preservation]] of decaying film stock is a matter of concern to both film historians and archivists and to companies interested in preserving their existing products in order to make them available to future generations (and thereby increase revenue). Preservation is generally a higher concern for nitrate and single-strip color films, due to their high decay rates; black-and-white films on safety bases and color films preserved on Technicolor imbibition prints tend to keep up much better, assuming proper handling and storage.

Some films in recent decades have been recorded using [[analog (signal)|analog]] [[video]] technology similar to that used in [[television production]]. Modern [[Digital video|digital video cameras]] and [[digital projector]]s are gaining ground as well. These approaches are preferred by some film-makers, especially because footage shot with [[digital cinema]] can be evaluated and edited with [[non-linear editing system]]s (NLE) without waiting for the film stock to be processed. The migration was gradual, and as of 2005, most major motion pictures were still shot on film.{{update after|2015|6|3}}

===Independent===
{{Main|Independent film}}
[[File:Fratelli Lumiere.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Auguste and Louis Lumière brothers seated looking left|[[Auguste and Louis Lumière|The Lumière Brothers]], who were among the first filmmakers]]
Independent filmmaking often takes place outside Hollywood, or other major [[studio system]]s. An independent film (or indie film) is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a [[list of Hollywood movie studios|major film studio]]. Creative, business and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century. On the business side, the costs of big-budget studio films also lead to conservative choices in cast and crew. There is a trend in Hollywood towards co-financing (over two-thirds of the films put out by [[Warner Bros.]] in 2000 were joint ventures, up from 10% in 1987).&lt;ref name="VARIETY_2003"&gt;{{cite web|first=Meredith|last=Amdur|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&amp;articleid=VR1117895718&amp;categoryid=10|title=Sharing Pix is Risky Business|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2003-11-16|accessdate=June 23, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915040337/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&amp;articleid=VR1117895718&amp;categoryid=10|archivedate=September 15, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hopeful director is almost never given the opportunity to get a job on a big-budget studio film unless he or she has significant industry experience in film or television. Also, the studios rarely produce films with unknown actors, particularly in lead roles.

Before the advent of [[digital cinematography|digital]] alternatives, the cost of professional film equipment and stock was also a hurdle to being able to produce, direct, or star in a traditional studio film. But the advent of consumer [[camcorder]]s in 1985, and more importantly, the arrival of high-resolution [[digital video]] in the early 1990s, have lowered the technology barrier to film production significantly. Both production and post-production costs have been significantly lowered; in the 2000s, the hardware and software for post-production can be installed in a commodity-based [[personal computer]]. Technologies such as [[DVD]]s, [[FireWire]] connections and a wide variety of professional and consumer-grade [[video editing software]] make film-making relatively affordable.

Since the introduction of digital video [[DV]] technology, the means of production have become more democratized. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot a film with a digital video camera and edit the film, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a high-end home computer. However, while the means of production may be democratized, financing, distribution, and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system. Most independent filmmakers rely on [[film festival]]s to get their films noticed and sold for distribution. The arrival of internet-based video websites such as [[YouTube]] and [[Veoh]] has further changed the filmmaking landscape, enabling indie filmmakers to make their films available to the public.

===Open content film===
{{Main|Open content film}}

An open content film is much like an independent film, but it is produced through open collaborations; its source material is available under a [[license]] which is permissive enough to allow other parties to create [[fan fiction]] or derivative works, than a traditional copyright. Like independent filmmaking, open source filmmaking takes place outside Hollywood, or other major [[studio system]]s.

A fan film is a film or video inspired by a film, [[television program]], [[comic book]] or a similar source, created by [[fan (aficionado)|fans]] rather than by the source's copyright holders or creators. Fan filmmakers have traditionally been [[amateur]]s, but some of the most notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to rarer full-length motion pictures.

==Distribution==
{{Main|Film distribution|Film release}}

Film distribution is the process through which a film is made available for viewing by an [[audience]]. This is normally the task of a professional [[film distributor]], who would determine the marketing strategy of the film, the media by which a film is to be exhibited or made available for viewing, and may set the [[film release|release date]] and other matters. The film may be exhibited directly to the public either through a [[movie theater]] (historically the main way films were distributed) or [[television]] for [[home video|personal home viewing]] (including on [[DVD-Video]] or [[Blu-ray Disc]], [[Video on demand|video-on-demand]], online [[download]]ing, [[television program]]s through [[broadcast syndication]] etc.). Other ways of distributing a film include rental or personal purchase of the film in a variety of media and formats, such as [[VHS]] tape or [[DVD]], or [[Internet]] [[download]]ing of [[streaming media|streaming]] using a computer.

==Animation==
{{Main|Animation}}
[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|right|upright=0.9|An animated image of a horse, made using eight pictures.]]
Animation is a technique in which each frame of a film is produced individually, whether generated as a computer graphic, or by photographing a drawn image, or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit (see [[claymation]] and [[stop motion]]), and then photographing the result with a special [[animation camera]]. When the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed at a speed of 16 or more frames per second, there is an illusion of continuous movement (due to the [[phi phenomenon]]). Generating such a film is very labor-intensive and tedious, though the development of [[computer animation]] has greatly sped up the process. Because animation is very time-consuming and often very expensive to produce, the majority of animation for [[Television|TV]] and films comes from professional animation studios. However, the field of [[independent animation]] has existed at least since the 1950s, with animation being produced by independent studios (and sometimes by a single person). Several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry.

[[Limited animation]] is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using "short cuts" in the animation process. This method was pioneered by [[United Productions of America|UPA]] and popularized by [[Hanna-Barbera]] in the [[United States]], and by [[Osamu Tezuka]] in [[Japan]], and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from [[movie theater]]s to [[television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6193603.stm|title= Hanna Barbera's golden age of animation|accessdate= 2007-01-25|last= Savage|first= Mark|date= 2006-12-19|work= |publisher= BBC News|pages= |language= |deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061219211006/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6193603.stm|archivedate= 2006-12-19|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most animation studios are now using digital technologies in their productions, there is a specific style of animation that depends on film. Camera-less animation, made famous by film-makers like [[Norman McLaren]], [[Len Lye]], and [[Stan Brakhage]], is painted and drawn directly onto pieces of film, and then run through a projector.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1587">'Herkogamy''' is a common strategy employed by hermaphroditic [[angiosperms]] to reduce sexual interference between male ([[anthers]]) and female (stigma) function. Herkogamy differs from other such strategies (e.g. [[dichogamy]]) by supplying a spatial separation of the anthers and stigma.

Two forms of herkogamy are most common:

1.  '''Approach Herkogamy''' – (pin) is the presentation of the stigma above the level of the anthers.  This arrangement of sex organs causes floral visitors to first contact the stigma, before removing [[pollen]] from the anthers.  This form of herkogamy is considered to be common, and is associated with a large, diverse fauna of floral visitors/[[pollinator]]s.

2.  '''Reverse Herkogamy''' – (thrum) is displayed when the stigma is recessed below the level of the anthers.  This arrangement causes floral visitors to first contact the anthers before the stigma.  For this reason, reverse herkogamy is believed to facilitate greater pollen export than approach herkogamy.  This type of sex-organ arrangement is typically associated with [[Lepidopteran]] (moth or butterfly) pollination.

===Creation and Historical Context===

On October 10, 1946 the first national assembly of the French fourth republic is chosen and on October 13 a new French constitution is selected through a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre BRÉCHON, « QUATRIÈME RÉPUBLIQUE », Encyclopædia Universalis [en ligne], consulté le 30 janvier 2015.

==Publications==
Publications include the ''Third World collection'' and the ''Third World review''.

IEDES signed international cooperation agreements with many African and Latin American  universities and supports projects implemented by international organizations such as [[UNESCO]].The Institute is part of scientific networks involving countries with varying living standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4680">'''Leaf expansion''' is a process by which plants make efficient use of the space around them by causing their leaves to enlarge, or wither. This process enables a plant to maximize its own [[biomass]], whether it be due to increased surface area; which enables more [[sunlight]] to be absorbed by [[chloroplasts]], driving the rate of [[photosynthesis]] upward, or it enables more [[stomata]] to be created on the leaf surface, allowing the plant to increase its [[carbon dioxide]] intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Control of Leaf Expansion: A Developmental Switch from Metabolics to Hydraulics |author1=Pantin F. |author2=Simmonneau T. |author3=Rolland G. |author4=Dauzat M. |author5=Muller B. |year= 2011 |doi= 10.1104/pp.111.176289 |journal= Plant Physiology |volume=  156|pages= 803–815 |pmid=21474437 |pmc=3177277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Plant Responses to Water Stress |author= Hsiao T.C.|year= 1973 |journal= Annual Review of Plant Physiology|volume= 156 |pages= 519–570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
Initially, sensory organs, such as chloroplasts, the [[cambium]], and [[Root|roots]], detect an external stimuli, such as light. The stimulus triggers biochemical events downstream that result in the expansion of tissue in the leaf. There are two processes found by which this occurs: osmotic regulation, which has a temporary effect that causes leaves to increase size, or wall extensibility, which gradually changes the leaf over time and permanently enlarges it.&lt;ref name=PCE&gt;{{cite journal |title= Leaf Expansion - an integrating plant behaviour |author= Volkenburgh, E.V.|year=1999 |doi= 10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00514.x |journal= Plant, Cell &amp; Environment |volume= 22 |pages= 1463–1473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osmotic regulation===
Red light hits leaves and depolarizes the [[plasma membrane]] of [[plant cells]] via [[photosensitive]] calcium and chloride [[ion channels]]. Chloride leaves the cells, while calcium enters. This depolarization causes an osmotic shift in ionic concentrations in the [[apoplast]], which concurrently causes an increase in [[turgor pressure]] based on apoplastic solute potentials, forming a [[electrical gradient]] across the plasma membrane. The increase in turgor pressure causes the cells to expand, enabling the choroplasts to shift to a different area, and the collective expansion of all the cells at once causes the leaf itself to become larger and more rigid. The movement of the chloroplasts enables light that was previously unobtainable to be reached and utilized.&lt;ref name=PCE/&gt;

===Wall extensibility===
Blue light hits a plant's leaves and causes the downstream activation of [[proton pumps]]. In turn, this results in a decrease of the cell wall's [[pH]]. The decrease, in conjunction with membrane-bound proteins called [[expansins]], increases the plasticity of the apoplastic membrane. This plasticity enables more cell area to be created during [[cell division]], which expands the leaf as more standard-sized cells are added. The increase in overall [[organelles]] and cell area cause more [[stoma]]tes to form and more light to be utilized.&lt;ref name=PCE/&gt;

==In nature==
Different types of plants tend to grow at different rates. Those that grow slowly tend to prioritize having much smaller leaf areas in order to conserve energy, and will only expend them when an excess of light is close by. This is due to light being scarce, their slow growth preventing them from reaching the heights that fast-growing plants reach that provides them with plentiful amounts of light. As a contrast, the fast-growing plants have large leaves as a result of constantly being bathed in light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Is inherent variation in RGR determined by LAR at low irradiance and by NAR at high irradiance?

[[File:Logistic-curve.svg|thumb|320px|right|Standard logistic sigmoid function i.e. &lt;math&gt;L=1,k=1,x_0=0&lt;/math&gt;]]

A '''logistic function''' or '''logistic curve''' is a common "S" shape ([[sigmoid function|sigmoid curve]]), with equation:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(x-x_0)}} &lt;/math&gt;

where
*''e'' = the [[natural logarithm]] base (also known as [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]]),
*''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = the ''x''-value of the sigmoid's midpoint,
*''L'' = the curve's maximum value, and
*''k'' = the logistic growth rate or steepness of the curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= Pierre-François |last=Verhulst |year= 1838| title = Notice sur la loi que la population poursuit dans son accroissement | journal = Correspondance mathématique et physique |volume = 10| pages = 113–121
|url = https://books.google.com/?id=8GsEAAAAYAAJ
| format = PDF| accessdate = 3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For values of ''x'' in the domain of [[real number]]s from −∞ to +∞, the S-curve shown on the right is obtained, with the graph of ''f'' approaching ''L'' as ''x'' approaches +∞ and approaching zero as ''x'' approaches −∞.

The logistic function finds applications in a range of fields, including [[artificial neural network]]s, [[biology]] (especially [[ecology]]), [[biomathematics]], [[chemistry]], [[demography]], [[economics]], [[geoscience]], [[mathematical psychology]], [[probability]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[linguistics]], and [[statistics]].

[[File:Courbe_logistique,_Verhulst,_1845.png|thumb|upright|300px|Original image of a logistic curve, contrasted with a logarithmic curve.]]

Verhulst did not explain the choice of the term "logistic" ({{lang-fr|logistique}}), but it is presumably in contrast to the ''logarithmic'' curve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Math-alive! using original sources to teach mathematics in social context |journal=[[PRIMUS (journal)|PRIMUS]] |first=Bonnie |last=Shulman |pages=1–14 |issue=March |year=1998 |doi=10.1080/10511979808965879 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233238354_Math-alive_using_original_sources_to_teach_mathematics_in_social_context |quote=
The diagram clinched it for me: there two curves labeled "Logistique" and "Logarithmique" are drawn on the same axes, and one can see that there is a region where they match almost exactly, and then diverge.&lt;br&gt;I concluded that Verhulst's intention in naming the curve was indeed to suggest this comparison, and that "logistic" was meant to convey the curve's "log-like" quality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|1=Verhulst first refers to arithmetic ''progression'' and geometric ''progression'', and refers to the geometric growth curve as a ''logarithmic'' curve (confusingly, the modern term is instead ''exponential'' curve, which is the inverse).

His growth model is preceded by a discussion of [[arithmetic growth]] and [[geometric growth]] (whose curve he calls a [[logarithmic curve]], instead of the modern term [[exponential curve]]), and thus "logistic growth" is presumably named by analogy, ''logistic'' being from {{lang-grc|λογῐστῐκός|logistikós}}, a traditional division of [[Greek mathematics]].{{efn|1=In Ancient Greece, {{lang|grc|λογῐστῐκός}} referred to practical computation and accounting, in contrast to {{lang|grc|ἀριθμητική}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|arithmētikḗ}}''), the theoretical or philosophical study of numbers. Confusingly, in English, ''[[arithmetic]]'' refers to practical computation, even though it derives from {{lang|grc|ἀριθμητική}}, not {{lang|grc|λογῐστῐκός}}. See for example {{w|Louis Charles Karpinski}}, ''[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015005675411 Nicomachus of Gerasa: Introduction to Arithmetic]'' (1926) p. 3: "Arithmetic is fundamentally associated by modern readers, particularly by scientists and mathematicians, with the art of computation. For the ancient Greeks after [[Pythagoras]], however, arithmetic was primarily a philosophical study, having no necessary connection with practical affairs. Indeed the Greeks gave a separate name to the arithmetic of business, ''λογιστική'' [accounting or practical logistic] ... In general the philosophers and mathematicians of Greece undoubtedly considered it beneath their dignity to treat of this branch, which probably formed a part of the elementary instruction of children."}} The term is unrelated to the military and management term ''[[logistics]]'', which is instead from {{lang-fr|{{wikt-lang|fr|logis}}}} "lodgings", though some believe the Greek term also influenced ''logistics''; see {{slink|Logistics|Origin}} for details.

== Mathematical properties ==
&lt;!--{{move section portions from|Pierre François Verhulst|date=February 2014}} Please see next section--&gt;
The '''{{visible anchor|standard logistic function}}''' is the logistic function with parameters (''k'' = 1, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''L'' = 1) which yields

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\
     &amp;= \frac{e^x}{e^x + 1} \\
     &amp;= \tfrac12 + \tfrac12 \tanh(\tfrac{x}{2}) \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In practice, due to the nature of the [[exponential function]] ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, it is often sufficient to compute the standard logistic function for ''x'' over a small range of real numbers such as a range contained in [−6,&amp;nbsp;+6] as it quickly converges very close to its saturation values of 0 and 1.

The logistic function has the symmetry property that:

: &lt;math&gt;1-f(x) = f(-x).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto f(x) - 1/2&lt;/math&gt; is an [[odd function]].

The logistic function is an offset and scaled [[hyperbolic tangent]] function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \tfrac12 + \tfrac12 \tanh(\tfrac{x}{2})&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\tanh(x) = 2 \, f(2x) - 1&lt;/math&gt;.

This follows from
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\tanh(x) &amp; = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} = \frac{e^x \cdot \left(1 - e^{-2x}\right)}{e^x \cdot \left(1 + e^{-2x}\right)} \\[6pt]
&amp; = f(2x) - \frac{e^{-2x}}{1+e^{-2x}} = f(2x) - \frac{e^{-2x} + 1 - 1}{1+e^{-2x}} = 2f(2x)-1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Derivative ===
The standard logistic function has an easily calculated [[derivative]]:

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac 1 {1+e^{-x}}= \frac {e^{x}} {1+e^{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \frac{e^{x} \cdot (1+e^{x})-e^{x} \cdot e^{x}}{(1 + e^{x})^2} =  \frac{e^{x}}{(1 + e^{x})^2} = f(x)(1-f(x))&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative of the logistic function is an [[even function]]:

: namely, &lt;math&gt;f'(-x)=f'(x)     &lt;/math&gt;

=== Integral ===
Conversely, its [[antiderivative]] can be computed by the [[Integration by substitution|substitution]] &lt;math&gt;u = 1 + e^x&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac {e^{x}} {1+e^{x}} = \frac {u'} {u}&lt;/math&gt;, so (dropping the [[constant of integration]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac {e^{x}} {1+e^{x}}\,dx = \int \frac 1 {u}\,du = \log u = \log (1 + e^x)&lt;/math&gt;

In [[artificial neural network]]s, this is known as the ''[[softplus]]'' function, and (with scaling) is a smooth approximation of the [[ramp function]], just as the logistic function (with scaling) is a smooth approximation of the [[Heaviside step function]].

=== Logistic differential equation ===
The standard logistic function is the solution of the simple first-order non-linear [[ordinary differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = f(x)(1-f(x)) &lt;/math&gt;

with [[boundary condition]] ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2.  This equation is the continuous version of the [[logistic map]].

The qualitative behavior is easily understood in terms of the [[Phase line (mathematics)|phase line]]: the derivative is 0 when the function is 1; and the derivative is positive for ''f'' between 0 and 1, and negative for ''f'' above 1 or less than 0 (though negative populations do not generally accord with a physical model). This yields an unstable equilibrium at 0, and a stable equilibrium at 1, and thus for any function value greater than 0 and less than 1, it grows to 1.

&lt;!-- The above equation can be rewritten in the following steps:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = f(x)(1-f(x)) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = y(1-y) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = y - y^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} - y = -y^2 &lt;/math&gt; trivial algebraic manipulation--&gt;
The logistic equation is a special case of the [[Bernoulli differential equation]] and has the following solution:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{e^{x}}{e^{x}+C}&lt;/math&gt;

Choosing the constant of integration &lt;math&gt;C=1&lt;/math&gt; gives the other well-known form of the definition of the logistic curve

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{e^x}{e^x + 1} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}&lt;/math&gt;

More quantitatively, as can be seen from the analytical solution, the logistic curve shows early [[exponential growth]] for negative argument, which slows to linear growth of slope 1/4 for an argument near 0, then approaches 1 with an exponentially decaying gap.

The logistic function is the inverse of the natural [[logit]] function and so can be used to convert the logarithm of [[odds]] into a [[probability]]. In mathematical notation the logistic function is sometimes written as ''expit''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/clusterPower/docs/expit expit documentation for R's clusterPower package]&lt;/ref&gt; in the same form as ''logit''. The conversion from the [[log-likelihood ratio]] of two alternatives also takes the form of a logistic curve.

The hyperbolic tangent relationship leads to another form for the logistic function's derivative:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac d {dx} f(x) = \frac 1 4 \operatorname{sech}^2\left(\tfrac{x}{2} \right), &lt;/math&gt;

which ties the logistic function into the [[logistic distribution]].

===Rotational symmetry about (0, &amp;frac12;)===
The sum of the logistic function and its reflection about the vertical axis, ''f''&amp;thinsp;(&amp;minus;''x'') is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{1+e^{-x}} + \frac 1 {1+e^{-(-x)}} = \frac{(1+e^x)+(1+e^{-x})}{(1+e^{-x})(1+e^x)} = \frac{2+e^x+e^{-x}}{1+e^x+e^{-x}+e^{x-x}} = \frac{2+e^x+e^{-x}}{2+e^x+e^{-x}} = 1 .&lt;/math&gt;

The logistic function is thus rotationally symmetrical about the point (0,&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Neural Networks - A Systematic Introduction|author=Raul Rojas|url=http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/rojas/neural/chapter/K11.pdf|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== In ecology: modeling population growth ===
[[File:Pierre Francois Verhulst.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Pierre-François Verhulst (1804–1849)]]
A typical application of the logistic equation is a common model of [[population growth]] (see also [[population dynamics]]), originally due to [[Pierre François Verhulst|Pierre-François Verhulst]] in 1838, where the rate of reproduction is proportional to both the existing population and the amount of available resources, all else being equal. The Verhulst equation was published after Verhulst had read [[Thomas Malthus]]' ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. Verhulst derived his logistic equation to describe the self-limiting growth of a [[biology|biological]] population. The equation was rediscovered in 1911 by [[Anderson Gray McKendrick|A. G. McKendrick]] for the growth of bacteria in broth and experimentally tested using a technique for nonlinear parameter estimation.&lt;ref name="McKendric Logistic"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0370164600025426|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|volume= 31 |date= January 1912|pages= 649–653 |title=XLV.—The Rate of Multiplication of Micro-organisms: A Mathematical Study|author= A. G. McKendricka; M. Kesava Paia1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equation is also sometimes called the ''Verhulst-Pearl equation'' following its rediscovery in 1920 by [[Raymond Pearl]] (1879–1940) and [[Lowell Reed]] (1888–1966) of the [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Raymond Pearl]] and [[Lowell Reed]]|title=On the Rate of Growth of the Population of the United States|url=http://math.bu.edu/people/mak/MA565/Pearl_Reed_PNAS_1920.pdf|date=June 1920|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|pages=275|number=6|volume=6|month=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another scientist, [[Alfred J. Lotka]] derived the equation again in 1925, calling it the ''law of population growth''.

Letting ''P'' represent population size (''N'' is often used in ecology instead) and ''t'' represent time, this model is formalized by the [[differential equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=r P \cdot \left(1 - \frac{P}{K}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant ''r'' defines the [[population growth rate|growth rate]] and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]].

In the equation, the early, unimpeded growth rate is modeled by the first term +''rP''. The value of the rate ''r'' represents the proportional increase of the population ''P'' in one unit of time. Later, as the population grows, the modulus of the second term (which multiplied out is −''rP''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''/K'') becomes almost as large as the first, as some members of the population ''P'' interfere with each other by competing for some critical resource, such as food or living space. This antagonistic effect is called the ''bottleneck'', and is modeled by the value of the parameter ''K''. The competition diminishes the combined growth rate, until the value of ''P'' ceases to grow (this is called ''maturity'' of the population).
The solution to the equation (with &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; being the initial population) is

:&lt;math&gt;P(t) = \frac{K P_0 e^{rt}}{K + P_0 \left( e^{rt} - 1\right)} &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\to\infty} P(t) = K&lt;/math&gt;.

Which is to say that ''K'' is the limiting value of ''P'': the highest value that the population can reach given infinite time (or come close to reaching in finite time). It is important to stress that the carrying capacity is asymptotically reached independently of the initial value ''P''(0)&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, and also in the case that ''P''(0)&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''K''.

In [[ecology]], [[species]] are sometimes referred to as [[r/K selection theory|''r''-strategist or ''K''-strategist]] depending upon the [[Natural selection|selective]] processes that have shaped their [[Biological life cycle|life history]] strategies.
[[Dimensional analysis|Choosing the variable dimensions]] so that ''n'' measures the population in units of carrying capacity, and ''τ'' measures time in units of ''1/r'', gives the dimensionless
differential equation

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dn}{d\tau} =  n (1-n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Time-varying carrying capacity ====
Since the environmental conditions influence the carrying capacity, as a consequence it can be time-varying: ''K''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, leading to the following mathematical model:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=rP \cdot \left(1 - \frac{P}{K(t)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

A particularly important case is that of carrying capacity that varies periodically with period ''T'':

: &lt;math&gt;K(t+T) = K(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be shown that in such a case, independently from the initial value ''P''(0)&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, ''P''(''t'') will tend to a unique periodic solution ''P''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), whose period is ''T''.

A typical value of ''T'' is one year: In such case ''K''(''t'') may reflect periodical variations of weather conditions.

Another interesting generalization is to consider that the carrying capacity ''K''(''t'') is a function of the population at an earlier time, capturing a delay in the way population modifies its environment. This leads to a logistic delay equation,&lt;ref name="delay carrying"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yukalov | first1 = V. I. | last2 = Yukalova | first2 = E.

=== In statistics and machine learning ===
Logistic functions are used in several roles in [[statistics]]. For example, they are the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the [[Logistic distribution|logistic family of distributions]], and they are, a bit simplified, used to model the chance a chess player has to beat his opponent in the [[Elo rating system]]. More specific examples now follow.

==== Logistic regression ====
{{Main|Logistic regression}}

Logistic functions are used in [[logistic regression]] to model how the probability ''p'' of an event may be affected by one or more [[explanatory variables]]: an example would be to have the model

: &lt;math&gt;p=f(a + bx)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'' is the explanatory variable and ''a'' and ''b'' are model parameters to be fitted and ''f'' is the standard logistic function.

Logistic regression and other [[log-linear model]]s are also commonly used in [[machine learning]]. A generalisation of the logistic function to multiple inputs is the [[softmax activation function]], used in [[multinomial logistic regression]].

Another application of the logistic function is in the [[Rasch model]], used in [[item response theory]]. In particular, the Rasch model forms a basis for [[maximum likelihood]] estimation of the locations of objects or persons on a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]], based on collections of categorical data, for example the abilities of persons on a continuum based on responses that have been categorized as correct and incorrect.

==== Neural networks ====
Logistic functions are often used in [[neural network]]s to introduce [[nonlinearity]] in the model or to clamp signals to within a specified [[Range (mathematics)|range]].  A popular [[artificial neuron|neural net element]] computes a [[linear combination]] of its input signals, and applies a bounded logistic function to the result; this model can be seen as a "smoothed" variant of the classical [[perceptron|threshold neuron]].

&lt;!-- A reason for its popularity in neural networks is because the logistic function satisfies the differential equation

:&lt;math&gt;y' = y(1-y)&lt;/math&gt;.

The right hand side is a low-degree polynomial. Furthermore, the polynomial has factors ''y'' and 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y'', both of which are simple to compute. Given ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sig(''t'') at a particular ''t'', the derivative of the logistic function at that ''t'' can be obtained by multiplying the two factors together. --&gt;
A common choice for the activation or "squashing" functions, used to clip for large magnitudes to keep the response of the neural network bounded&lt;ref name="Gershenfeld-1999"&gt;Gershenfeld 1999, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;g(h) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-2 \beta h}}&lt;/math&gt;

which is a logistic function.
These relationships result in simplified implementations of [[artificial neural network]]s with [[artificial neuron]]s. Practitioners caution that sigmoidal functions which are [[Odd functions|antisymmetric]] about the origin (e.g. the [[hyperbolic tangent]]) lead to faster convergence when training networks with [[backpropagation]].&lt;ref name="LeCun-1998"&gt;{{cite book | author1 = LeCun, Y.  | author2 = Bottou, L.  | author3 = Orr, G. | author4 = Muller, K. | editor = Orr, G. | editor2 = Muller, K. | year = 1998 | title = Efficient BackProp  | work = Neural Networks: Tricks of the trade  | isbn = 3-540-65311-2 | publisher = Springer | url = http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98b.pdf | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logistic function is itself the derivative of another proposed activation function, the [[softplus]].

=== In medicine: modeling of growth of tumors ===
{{See also|Gompertz curve#Growth of tumors}}
Another application of logistic curve is in medicine, where the logistic differential equation is used to model the growth of tumors. This application can be considered an extension of the above-mentioned use in the framework of ecology (see also the [[Generalized logistic curve]], allowing for more parameters). Denoting with ''X''(''t'') the size of the tumor at time ''t'', its dynamics are governed by:

: &lt;math&gt;X'=r\left(1 - \frac X K \right)X&lt;/math&gt;

which is of the type:

:&lt;math&gt;X'=F(X)X, \qquad F'(X) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''(''X'') is the proliferation rate of the tumor.

If a chemotherapy is started with a log-kill effect, the equation may be revised to be

:&lt;math&gt;X'=r\left(1 - \frac X K \right)X - c(t)X,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c''(''t'') is the therapy-induced death rate. In the idealized case of very long therapy, ''c''(''t'') can be modeled as a periodic function (of period ''T'') or (in case of continuous infusion therapy) as a constant function, and one has that

:&lt;math&gt; \frac 1 T \int_0^T c(t)\, dt &gt; r \to \lim_{t \to +\infty} x(t) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. if the average therapy-induced death rate is greater than the baseline proliferation rate then there is the eradication of the disease. Of course, this is an oversimplified model of both the growth and the therapy (e.g. it does not take into account the phenomenon of clonal resistance).

=== In chemistry: reaction models ===
The concentration of reactants and products in [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic reactions]] follow the logistic function.
The degradation of PGM-free ORR catalyst in fuel cell cathode follows the logistic decay function &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yin |first1=Xi |last2=Zelenay |first2=Piotr |title=Kinetic Models for the Degradation Mechanisms of PGM-Free ORR Catalysts |journal=ECS Transactions |date=13 July 2018 |volume=85 |issue=13 |pages=1239–1250 |doi=10.1149/08513.1239ecst}}&lt;/ref&gt;, suggesting an autocatalytic degradation mechanism.

=== In physics: Fermi distribution ===
The logistic function determines the statistical distribution of fermions over the energy states of a system in thermal equilibrium. In particular, it is the distribution of the probabilities that each possible energy level is occupied by a fermion, according to [[Fermi function|Fermi–Dirac statistics]].

=== In material science: Phase diagrams ===
[[Diffusion bonding]].

=== In linguistics: language change ===
In linguistics, the logistic function can be used to model [[language change]]:&lt;ref name="probabilistic linguistics"&gt;Bod, Hay, Jennedy (eds.) 2003, pp. 147–156&lt;/ref&gt; an innovation that is at first marginal begins to spread more quickly with time, and then more slowly as it becomes more universally adopted.

=== In agriculture: modeling crop response ===
The logistic S-curve can be used for modeling the crop response to changes in growth factors. There are two types of response functions:  ''positive''  and ''negative'' growth curves. For example, the crop yield may ''increase'' with increasing value of the growth factor up to a certain level (positive function), or it may ''decrease'' with increasing growth factor values (negative function owing to a negative growth factor), which situation requires an ''inverted'' S-curve.
{| class="wikitable"
|The logistic S-curve can be used to model the relation between crop yield and depth of the '''[[water table]]''' in the soil.&lt;ref name="calc"&gt;Calculator for crop response to changes in growth factors using [[segmented regression]], S-curves and [[Parabola|parabolas]]. On line: [https://www.waterlog.info/segreg.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;The inverted logistic S-curve can be used to model the relation between crop yield and '''[[soil salinity]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Software for fitting S-curves to data sets [https://www.waterlog.info/sigmoid.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

=== In economics and sociology: diffusion of innovations ===
The logistic function can be used to illustrate the progress of the [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion of an innovation]] through its life cycle.

In ''The Laws of Imitation'' (1890), [[Gabriel Tarde]] describes the rise and spread of new ideas through imitative chains. In particular, Tarde identifies three main stages through which innovations spread: the first one corresponds to the difficult beginnings, during which the idea has to struggle within a hostile environment full of opposing habits and beliefs; the second one corresponds to the properly exponential take-off of the idea, with &lt;math&gt;f(x)=2^x&lt;/math&gt;; finally, the third stage is logarithmic, with &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\log(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and corresponds to the time when the impulse of the idea gradually slows down while, simultaneously new opponent ideas appear. The ensuing situation halts or stabilizes the progress of the innovation, which approaches an asymptote.

In the history of economy, when new products are introduced there is an intense amount of research and development which leads to dramatic improvements in quality and reductions in cost.  This leads to a period of rapid industry growth. Some of the more famous examples are: railroads, incandescent light bulbs, [[electrification]], [[cars]] and air travel. Eventually, dramatic improvement and cost reduction opportunities are exhausted, the product or process are in widespread use with few remaining potential new customers, and markets become saturated.

Logistic analysis was used in papers by several researchers at the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis ([[IIASA]]). These papers deal with the diffusion of various innovations, infrastructures and energy source substitutions and the role of work in the economy as well as with the long economic cycle. Long economic cycles were investigated by Robert Ayres (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In [[zoology]], '''mammalogy''' is the study of [[mammal]]s – a [[class (biology)|class]] of [[vertebrate]]s with characteristics such as [[homeotherm]]ic [[metabolism]], [[fur]], four-chambered [[heart]]s, and complex [[nervous system]]s. Mammalogy has also been known as "'''mastology'''," "'''theriology'''," and "'''therology'''." There are about 4,200 different species of mammals. The major branches of mammalogy include natural history, taxonomy and systematics, anatomy and physiology, ethology, ecology, and management and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/mammalogy|title=mammalogy {{!}} zoology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approximate salary of a mammalogist varies from $20,000 to $60,000 a year, depending on their experience.  Mammalogists are typically involved in activities such as conducting research, managing personnel, and writing proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mammalogist|url=http://www.aboutbioscience.org/careers/mammalogist|work=Bioscience Careers|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammalogy branches off into other taxonomically-oriented disciplines such as [[primatology]] (study of [[primates]]), and [[cetology]] (study of [[cetaceans]]). Like other studies, mammalogy is also  a part of zoology which is also a part of biology.

== List of mammalogy journals ==

This is a list of scientific journals broadly serving mammalogists. In addition, many other more general zoology, ecology and evolution, or conservation journals also deal with mammals, and several journals are specific to only certain taxonomic groups of mammals.

'''Management science''' ('''MS'''), is the broad interdisciplinary study of problem solving and decision making in human organizations, with strong links to [[management]], [[economics]], [[business]], [[engineering]], [[management consulting]], and other [[sciences]]. It uses various scientific [[research]]-based [[principles]], [[strategies]], and [[analytical method]]s including  [[mathematical model]]ing, [[statistics]] and [[numerical algorithm]]s to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and accurate [[management]] decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems.  Management sciences help businesses to achieve goals using various scientific methods. 

The field was initially an outgrowth of [[applied mathematics]], where early challenges were problems relating to the [[optimization]] of systems which could be modeled linearly, i.e., determining the optima ([[Maxima and minima|maximum]] value of [[profit (accounting)|profit]], assembly line performance, [[crop yield]], bandwidth, etc. or [[Maxima and minima|minimum]] of loss, risk, costs, etc.) of some objective function. Today, management science encompasses any organizational activity for which the problem can be structured as a functional system so as to obtain a solution set with identifiable characteristics.

== Overview ==
Management science is concerned with a number of different areas of study: One is developing and applying [[scientific modeling|model]]s and [[concept]]s that may prove useful in helping to illuminate [[management]] issues and solve managerial problems. The models used can often be represented mathematically, but sometimes computer-based, [[visual]] or [[Speech|verbal]] representations are used as well or instead.&lt;ref name= "LS"&gt; [http://www.lums.lancs.ac.uk/departments/ManSci/DeptProfile/WhatisManSci/ What is Management Science?] Lancaster University, 2008. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Another area is designing and developing new and better models of organizational excellence. 

Management science research can be done on three levels:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/mphil_mgtscience/mgtresearch.html What is Management Science Research?] University of Cambridge 2008. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fundamental level lies in three mathematical disciplines: [[probability]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], and [[dynamical systems theory]].
* The modeling level is about building models, analyzing them mathematically, gathering and analyzing data, implementing models on computers, solving them, experimenting with them&amp;mdash;all this is part of management science research on the modeling level. This level is mainly instrumental, and driven mainly by [[statistics]] and [[econometrics]]. 
* The application level, just as in any other [[engineering]] and [[economics]] disciplines, strives to make a practical impact and be a driver for change in the real world.

The management scientist's mandate is to use rational, systematic, science-based techniques to inform and improve decisions of all kinds. The techniques of management science are not restricted to business applications but may be applied to [[military]], medical, [[public administration]], charitable groups, political groups or community groups.

== History ==
Its origins can be traced to [[operations research]], which made its debut during [[World War II]] when the Allied forces recruited scientists of various disciplines to assist with military operations. In these early applications, the scientists utilized simple mathematical models to make efficient use of limited technologies and resources. The application of these models within the corporate sector became known as management science.&lt;ref name="UTK"&gt; [http://bus.utk.edu/soms/information/whatis_msci.html What is Management Science?] The University of Tennessee, 2006. Retrieved 5 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1967 [[Stafford Beer]] characterized the field of management science as "the business use of operations research".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stafford Beer]] (1967). ''Management Science: The Business Use of Operations Research''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the fields that management science involves include:  
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
* [[Data mining]]
* [[Decision analysis]] 
* [[Engineering]]
* [[Forecasting]]

as well as many others.

== Applications ==
Applications of management science are abundant in industry as [[airlines]], manufacturing companies, [[service organization]]s, military branches, and in [[government]]. The range of problems and issues to which management science has contributed insights and solutions is vast. It includes:.&lt;ref name= "LS"/&gt;
* [[scheduling]] airlines, both planes and crew 
* deciding the appropriate place to site new facilities such as a warehouse or factory 
* managing the flow of water from reservoirs 
* identifying possible future development paths for parts of the telecommunications industry 
* establishing the information needs and appropriate systems to supply them within the health service 
* identifying and understanding the strategies adopted by companies for their [[information system]]s

Management science  is also concerned with so-called "soft-operational analysis", which concerns methods for [[strategic planning]], strategic [[decision support]], and [[problem structuring methods]] (PSM). At this level of abstraction, mathematical modeling and simulation will not suffice. Therefore, during the past 30 years, a number of non-quantified modelling methods have been developed. These include [[morphological analysis (problem-solving)|morphological analysis]] and various forms of [[influence diagram]]s.

'''Marine microorganisms''' are defined by their habitat as the [[microorganism]]s living in a [[Marine habitat|marine environment]], that is, in the [[saline water|saltwater]] of a sea or ocean or the [[brackish]] water of a coastal [[estuary]]. A microorganism (or microbe) is any [[Microscope|microscopic]] [[life|living]] [[organism]], that is, any life form too small for the naked human eye to see, needing a microscope. Microorganisms are very diverse. They can be [[unicellular organism|single-celled]]&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite book | editor1=Madigan M |editor2=Martinko J | title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition=13th | publisher=Pearson Education | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-321-73551-5 |page=1096}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] and include all [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] and most [[protozoa]], as well as some species of [[fungi]], [[algae]], and certain microscopic animals, such as [[rotifer]]s. Many [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] animals and [[plant]]s have microscopic [[juvenile (organism)|juvenile stages]].

The microorganism in the oceans include [[viruses]], [[prokaryotes]] ([[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]]), and [[protists]].

A [[virus]] is a small [[pathogen|infectious agent]] that [[Replicate (biology)|replicates]] only inside the living [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of other [[organism]]s. Viruses can infect all types of [[life forms]], from [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s to [[microorganism]]s, including [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].&lt;ref name="pmid16984643"&gt;{{vcite journal

When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles. These viral particles, also known as ''virions'', consist of two or three parts: (i) the [[genetic material]] made from either [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], long [[molecule]]s that carry genetic information; (ii) a [[protein]] coat, called the [[capsid]], which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[lipid]]s that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside a cell. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple [[helix|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others. Most virus species have virions that are too small to be seen with an [[optical microscope]]. The average virion is about one one-hundredth the size of the average [[bacterium]].

The origins of viruses in the [[evolutionary history of life]] are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of [[horizontal gene transfer]], which increases [[genetic diversity]].&lt;ref name="Canchaya" /&gt; Viruses are considered by some to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through [[natural selection]]. However, they lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as "organisms at the edge of life"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{vcite journal|author = Rybicki, EP|year = 1990|title = The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics|journal = South African Journal of Science |volume = 86|pages = 182–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as replicators.&lt;ref name="Koonin and Starokadomskyy"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Are viruses alive?

[[File:Vibrio vulnificus 01.png|thumb|right|''[[Vibrio vulnificus]]'', a virulent bacterium found in [[estuaries]] and along coastal areas]]

[[Bacteria]] constitute a large [[domain (biology)|domain]] of [[prokaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s. Typically a few [[micrometre]]s in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on [[Earth]], and are present in most of its [[habitat]]s. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, [[Hot spring|acidic hot springs]], [[radioactive waste]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fredrickson JK, Zachara JM, Balkwill DL, Kennedy D, Li SM, Kostandarithes HM, Daly MJ, Romine MF, Brockman FJ | title = Geomicrobiology of high-level nuclear waste-contaminated vadose sediments at the Hanford site, Washington state | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 70 | issue = 7 | pages = 4230–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15240306 | pmc = 444790 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.70.7.4230-4241.2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the deep portions of [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]]. Bacteria also live in [[symbiotic]] and [[parasitic]] relationships with plants and animals.

Once regarded as [[plant]]s constituting the class ''Schizomycetes'', bacteria are now classified as [[prokaryotes]]. Unlike cells of animals and other [[eukaryote]]s, bacterial cells do not contain a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and rarely harbour [[cell membrane|membrane-bound]] [[organelle]]s. Although the term ''bacteria'' traditionally included all prokaryotes, the [[scientific classification]] changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that [[evolution|evolved]] from an ancient common ancestor. These [[domain (biology)|evolutionary domains]] are called ''Bacteria'' and ''[[Archaea]]''.&lt;ref name="Woese"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woese CR, Kandler O, Wheelis ML | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | pmc = 54159 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | bibcode = 1990PNAS...87.4576W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaea were initially classified as [[bacteria]], but this classification is outdated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pace NR |title=Time for a change |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7091 |page=289 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16710401 |doi=10.1038/441289a|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..289P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains of life, [[Bacteria]] and [[Eukaryota]]. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized [[phylum|phyla]]. Classification is difficult because the majority have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their [[nucleic acid]]s in samples from their environment.

Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although a few archaea have very strange shapes, such as the flat and square-shaped cells of ''[[Haloquadratum|Haloquadratum walsbyi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stoeckenius W |title=Walsby's square bacterium: fine structure of an orthogonal procaryote |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=148 |issue=1 |pages=352–60 |date=1 October 1981|pmid=7287626 |url=http://jb.asm.org/content/148/1/352.long |pmc=216199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess [[gene]]s and several [[metabolic pathway]]s that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably the [[enzyme]]s involved in [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation (biology)|translation]]. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on [[ether lipid]]s in their [[cell membrane]]s, such as [[archaeol]]s. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from [[organic compounds]], such as sugars, to [[ammonia]], [[ion|metal ions]] or even [[hydrogen|hydrogen gas]]. Salt-tolerant archaea (the [[Haloarchaea]]) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea [[carbon fixation|fix carbon]]; however, unlike plants and [[cyanobacteria]], no known species of archaea does both. Archaea [[asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]] by [[binary fission]], [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]], or [[budding]]; unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no known species forms [[spore]]s. Unlike viruses and bacteria, no known archaea is a pathogen.

Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in [[plankton]] may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the [[carbon cycle]] and the [[nitrogen cycle]].

Marine fungi can be classified as:&lt;ref name="Sridhar2009" /&gt;
* Lower fungi - adapted to marine habitats ([[Zoospore|zoosporic]] fungi, including mastigomycetes: [[oomycete]]s and [[chytridiomycetes]])
* Higher fungi - filamentous, modified to planktonic lifestyle ([[hyphomycetes]], [[Ascomycota|ascomycetes]], [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycetes]])

Most mycoplankton species are higher fungi.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Lichen]]s are [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] associations between a fungus, usually an ascomycete, and an alga or a [[Cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]]. Several lichens are found in marine environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocean.otr.usm.edu/~w529014/index_files/Page2025.htm Species of Higher Marine Fungi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422084649/http://ocean.otr.usm.edu/~w529014/index_files/Page2025.htm |date=22 April 2013 }} University of Mississippi.

According to fossil records, fungi date back to the late [[Proterozoic]] era 900-570 million years ago.

===Marine protists===
{{see also|Protozoa}}

Of [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] groups, the [[protists]] are most commonly [[unicellular]] and microscopic. This is a highly diverse group of organisms that are not easy to classify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cavalier-Smith T |title=Kingdom protozoa and its 18 phyla |journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=953–94 |date=1 December 1993|pmid=8302218 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8302218 |pmc=372943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Corliss JO |title=Should there be a separate code of nomenclature for the protists? |journal=BioSystems |volume=28 |issue=1–3 |pages=1–14 |year=1992 |pmid=1292654 | doi=10.1016/0303-2647(92)90003-H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[algae]] species are [[multicellular]] protists, and there are marine [[slime molds]] have unique life cycles that involve switching between unicellular, colonial, and multicellular forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Devreotes P |title=''Dictyostelium discoideum'': a model system for cell-cell interactions in development |journal=Science |volume=245 |issue=4922 |pages=1054–8 |year=1989 |pmid=2672337 | doi=10.1126/science.2672337|bibcode=1989Sci...245.1054D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of species of protists is unknown, and we may have identified only a small portion.

===Marine microanimals===
{{see also|Microanimal|Ichthyoplankton}}

At least one microscopic animal group, the [[parasite|parasitic]] [[cnidaria]]n [[Myxozoa]], is unicellular in its adult form, and includes marine species. Other marine [[microanimal]]s are multicellular. Microscopic [[arthropod]]s are more commonly found inland in freshwater, but there are marine species as well. Microscopic marine [[crustacean]]s include some [[copepod]]s, [[cladocera]] and [[tardigrade|water bears]]. Some marine [[nematode]]s and [[rotifer]]s are also too small to be seen with the naked eye, as are many [[loricifera]], including the recently discovered [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] species that spend their lives in an [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Janet Fang |date=6 April 2010 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100406/full/464825b.html |title=Animals thrive without oxygen at sea bottom |journal=Nature |volume=464 |doi=10.1038/464825b |pmid=20376121 |pages=825 |issue=7290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/58154/description/Multicelled_animals_may_live_oxygen-free|title=Briny deep basin may be home to animals thriving without oxygen|work=Science News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copepods contribute more to the [[secondary productivity]] and [[carbon sink]] of the world oceans than any other group of organisms.

The '''Mesoamerican Society for Ecological Economics''' ('''SMEE''') is a regional chapter of the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] (ISEE). After its foundation in 2008 at Guatemala City, the organization has already celebrated its first International Conference in 2010 at Mexico City and will carry out the second International Conference, EcoEco Alternatives, between March 4 and 8 2014 at the main campus of the [[University of Costa Rica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecoecomesoamerica.org/page/read/3 About the SMEE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826021103/http://ecoecomesoamerica.org/page/read/3 |date=2013-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This branch of the [[International Society for Ecological Economics|ISEE]] has a unique emphasis within [[ecological economics]]. Topics like [[Social Justice|social justice]] and the human value in environmental conservation prevail in this region. As a consequence of the strong influence from [[Joan Martinez Alier|Joan Martinez Alier's]] "environmentalism of the poor or social environmentalism", major attention is given to ecological-distributive conflicts. Alier insists that in the South a struggle exists against these conflicts generated by economic growth, mainly by the North. These endeavors "attempt to preserve the access of the communities to natural resources and services." &lt;ref&gt;Martínez Alier J. (1998), Ecological economics as human economics, Fundación César Manrique, Lanzarote (Canary Islands).&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of the negative effects on the environment by economic distribution, the cultural influence is also widely debated. For instance, the anthropologist [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]] suggests that culturally-driven preferences are one of the main factors degrading the environment. For example, society naturally gives privilege to the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] model that distributes natural resources with the purposes of production and profit, instead of endorsing the [[Agroforestry|agroforestal]] ecosystem model, which is less harmful to the [[Natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;Escobar A. (1999), “An Ecology of Difference: Equality and Conflict in a Glocalized World”, in: 
Arizpe, L. (ed) World Culture Report II, Unesco, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of this alternate perception in [[Mesoamerica]], [[Ecological economics]] doesn't consider that the economic valuation of natural resources nor environmental norms are effective solutions to these social-environmental conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuhem.org/media/ecosocial/File/Boletin%20ECOS/Boletin%206/Conflictos%20ambientales_M.WALTER_mar09_final.pdf Environmental, Social-Environmental, and Ecological-distributive conflicts within the environmental context... Reflections about the approaches and definitions] Walter, Mariana (2009), CIP-ECOSOCIAL – Boletín ECOS nº6&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an alternative based on community-based conservation and the management of [[sustainability]] is more advocated upon. By adding the latter cultural perspective, the three pillars of [[sustainable development]] (the social, environmental, and economic)&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/487/63/PDF/N0548763.pdf?OpenElement Final Document of the 2005 Global Summit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725205352/http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/487/63/PDF/N0548763.pdf?OpenElement |date=2009-07-25 }} Approved Resolution of the UN General Assembly. Ratified 10/24/2005.&lt;/ref&gt; end up being addressed by these proponents.

==History==

After the second biennial meeting of the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] in 1994 at [[San José, Costa Rica]], several professionals in the region became interested in creating a branch of this organization in their own countries to respond to the increasing development and worsening of social-environmental conflicts by the [[Neoclassical economics|conventional-economics]]-based policies.

However, it wasn't until 2008 that the efforts of the [[Latin American Social Sciences Institute]] in Guatemala, the [http://www.cinpe.una.ac.cr/ International Center for Political Economy] at the National University of Costa Rica, and the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana|Metropolitan Autonomous University]] of Mexico resulted in the Ecological Economics Forum, May 26 and 27 2008 at [[Guatemala City]], with the participation of zealous youth, students, and 50 professionals of [[Mesoamerica]].

Highly-recognized experts spoke, such as [[Alejandro Nadal]], Coordinator of the working group on the Environment, Macroeconomics, Trade and Investments of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN); David Barkin and Roberto Constantino from the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana|Metropolitan Autonomous University]] of Mexico; Eduardo García Frapolli from the Center for Ecosystem Research of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]; Bernardo Aguilar of [[Prescott College]], [[Arizona|AZ]], [[United States|U.S.]] and Executive Director of the [http://www.en.neotropica.org/ Fundacion Neotropica] in [[Costa Rica]]; Miguel Martínez of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF Guatemala), and Juan Pablo Castañeda of the Institute of Agriculture, Natural Resources, and the Environment of the Rafael Landívar University in [[Guatemala]].

This meeting undertook the writing of the organization's Constitution and the election of the first Board of Directors. Under the lead of the first President, M. Sc. Iliana Monterroso of Guatemala, the consolidation of the legal inscription and statutes took place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecoecomesoamerica.org/page/read/5 Mensaje de la Presidencia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010061529/http://ecoecomesoamerica.org/page/read/5 |date=2013-10-10 }}, Bernardo Aguilar (2013), accessed: July 18th, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Forum's participants, the main objectives of the SMEE are to create an open field for discussion of the methodological and theoretical development of [[Ecological economics]], to promote interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary scientific research, and to support academic initiatives related to this thematic in the region.

In 2010, the First International (and Biennial) Conference of the SMEE was celebrated at the Ecological Park of Xochimilco, [[Mexico City]], from November 22 to the 26th. Very influential speakers such as [[Fander Falconí]]; David Barkin; Mario Pérez, and Carlos Muñóz Piña lectured about and discussed the [[Ecological economics]] platform for the advancement of [[social justice]], [[environmental justice]], and the principles of [[sustainability]].

Since then, the new Board of Directors has had to deal with a shortage of memberships and the last [[financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis]]; but despite these challenges, it has achieved important progress in creating its [http://ecoecomesoamerica.org/ website] and completing several ecological economics studies and projects with the [http://www.neotropica.org/ Fundacion Neotropica]. Furthermore, the organization foresees the inauguration of a professional Master's program on [[ecological economics]] and [[political ecology]] at the [http://www.uci.ac.cr/ University for International Cooperation] and the proceeding of the 2014 EcoEco Alternatives Biennial Conference.

{{Quotation| We agree with the premise that the methodological pluralism characteristic of ecological economics must be understood beyond the philosophy of "everything counts." It must respond to epistemology required by the necessities established by the specific context of the conflict within that region. |Bernardo Aguilar Gonzalez, President's Letter}}

==Boards of Directors==
The Board of Directors rotates every two years and is usually elected around the biennial conference. The next election will take place in March, 2014.

==EcoEco Alternatives 2014 Conference==

The Second International Conference of the Mesoamerican Society for Ecological Economics will take place at the Rodrigro Facio campus of the [[University of Costa Rica]] from March 4 to the 8th, 2014, with the support of the [http://www.biologia.ucr.ac.cr/ School of Biology] and the [http://www.neotropica.org/ Fundacion Neotropica]. Its purpose is to further the debate on [[Ecological economics]] and to sensitize more people about the importance of the ecological crisis and the solutions proposed by this school of thought.

The Conference's thematic will be "Advancing Towards Alternatives for People and [[Ecosystem]]s in [[Latin America]]". It will include multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary debates about the resolution of social-environmental conflicts, the alternatives within the ecological economics model for handling [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Service (economics)|services]], and the social conflicts related to the [[distribution of wealth]] and [[gender]].

'''Metabolomics''' is the scientific study of chemical processes involving [[metabolite]]s, the small molecule intermediates and products of metabolism. Specifically, metabolomics is the "systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind", the study of their small-molecule [[metabolite]] profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Bennett |last=Daviss |date=April 2005 |title=Growing pains for metabolomics |journal=The Scientist |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=25–28 |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/15427/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[metabolome]] represents the complete set of metabolites in a biological cell, tissue, organ or organism, which are the end products of cellular processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=Kate W.|last2=Nordenstam|first2=Johan|last3=Lauwers|first3=Gregory Y.|last4=Rothenberger|first4=David A.|last5=Alavi|first5=Karim|last6=Garwood|first6=Michael|last7=Cheng|first7=Leo L.|title=Metabolomic Characterization of Human Rectal Adenocarcinoma with Intact Tissue Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy|journal=Diseases of the Colon &amp; Rectum|volume=52|issue=3|year=2009|pages=520–525|issn=0012-3706|doi=10.1007/DCR.0b013e31819c9a2c|pmid=19333056|pmc=2720561}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mRNA]] [[gene expression]] data and [[proteomics|proteomic]] analyses reveal the set of gene products being produced in the cell, data that represents one aspect of cellular function.  Conversely, metabolic profiling can give an instantaneous snapshot of the physiology of that cell, and thus, metabolomics provides a direct "functional readout of the physiological state" of an organism.&lt;ref&gt;Metabolomics: current technologies and future trends&lt;/ref&gt; One of the challenges of [[systems biology]] and [[functional genomics]] is to integrate [[genomics]], [[transcriptomics|transcriptomic]], [[proteomics|proteomic]], and metabolomic information to provide a better understanding of cellular biology.

== History ==
The beginning of metabolomics traces back to 2000-1500 B.C. At this time, [[History of medical diagnosis#Ancient China|Ancient Chinese doctors]] used ants for the evaluation of urine of patients to detect whether the urine contained high levels of glucose, and hence detect diabetes.&lt;ref name=VDGarticle&gt;Van der greef and Smilde, J Chemomet, (2005) 19:376-386&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages, "urine charts" were used to link the colours, tastes and smells of urine to various medical conditions, which are metabolic in origin.&lt;ref name=JKNnature&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicholson JK, Lindon JC |title=Systems biology: Metabonomics |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7216 |pages=1054–6 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18948945 |doi=10.1038/4551054a |url=|bibcode = 2008Natur.455.1054N }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 300 B.C., the ancient Greeks first use body fluids (called humor at the time) to predict disease, which shows the early steps towards metabolomics. Later in 131 A.D., Galen developed a system of pathology that combined the humoral theories of Hippocrates with the Pythagorean theory. Galen’s theory was unchallenged and remained standard until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Metabolomics: Current technologies and future trends&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept that individuals might have a "metabolic profile" that could be reflected in the makeup of their biological fluids was introduced by Roger Williams in the late 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gates |first=Sweeley | year = 1978 | title =Quantitative metabolic profiling based on gas chromatography |journal = [[Clin Chem]] | volume = 24 | issue = 10| pages = 1663–73 | pmid = 359193 | last2 = Sweeley | first2 = CC }}&lt;/ref&gt; who used [[paper chromatography]] to suggest characteristic metabolic patterns in urine and saliva were associated with diseases such as [[schizophrenia]]. However, it was only through technological advancements in the 1960s and 1970s that it became feasible to quantitatively (as opposed to qualitatively) measure metabolic profiles.&lt;ref&gt;Preti, George. "Metabolomics comes of age?" ''[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]'', 19[11]:8, June 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "metabolic profile" was introduced by Horning, ''et al.'' in 1971 after they demonstrated that [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]] (GC-MS) could be used to measure compounds present in human urine and tissue extracts.&lt;ref name="VDGarticle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Novotny | year = 2008 | title =  Biochemical individuality reflected in chromatographic, electrophoretic and mass-spectrometric profiles| url = | journal = J Chromatogr B | volume = 866 | issue = | pages = 26–47 | doi = 10.1016/j.jchromb.2007.10.007 | last2 = Soini | first2 = Helena A. | last3 = Mechref | first3 = Yehia |display-authors=etal| pmc = 2603028}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Horning group, along with that of [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Arthur B. Robinson]] led the development of GC-MS methods to monitor the metabolites present in urine through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Griffiths W.J. |author2=Wang Y. | year = 2009 | title =  Mass spectrometry: From proteomics to metabolomics and lipidomics| url = | journal = Chem Soc Rev | volume = 38 | issue = 7| pages = 1882–96 | doi = 10.1039/b618553n | pmid = 19551169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrently, [[NMR spectroscopy]], which was discovered in the 1940s, was also undergoing rapid advances. In 1974, Seeley et al. demonstrated the utility of using NMR to detect metabolites in unmodified biological samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoult DI, Busby SJ, Gadian DG, Radda GK, Richards RE, Seeley PJ |title=Observation of tissue metabolites using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance |journal=Nature |volume=252 |issue=5481 | pages=285–7 |date=November 1974 |pmid=4431445 | doi=10.1038/252285a0 | bibcode=1974Natur.252..285H}}&lt;/ref&gt; This first study on muscle highlighted the value of NMR in that it was determined that 90% of cellular [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is complexed with magnesium. As sensitivity has improved with the evolution of higher magnetic field strengths and [[magic angle spinning]], NMR continues to be a leading analytical tool to investigate metabolism.&lt;ref name=VDGarticle/&gt;&lt;ref name=JKNnature/&gt; Recent{{When|date=September 2012}} efforts to utilize NMR for metabolomics have been largely driven by the laboratory of [[Jeremy K. Nicholson]] at [[Birkbeck College, University of London]] and later at [[Imperial College London]]. In 1984, Nicholson showed &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy could potentially be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus, and later pioneered the application of pattern recognition methods to NMR spectroscopic data.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes E and Antti H (2002) Analyst 127:1549-57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lenz EM, Wilson ID | year = 2007 | title =  Analytical strategies in metabonomics| url = | journal = J Proteome Res | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 443–58 | doi = 10.1021/pr0605217 | pmid = 17269702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the first metabolomics web database, [[METLIN]],&lt;ref name="Smith CA, I'Maille G, Want EJ, Qin C, Trauger SA, Brandon TR, Custodio DE, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G 2005 747–51"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith CA, I'Maille G, Want EJ, Qin C, Trauger SA, Brandon TR, Custodio DE, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G |title=METLIN: a metabolite mass spectral database |journal=Ther Drug Monit |volume=27 |issue=6| pages=747–51 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16404815 |url=http://masspec.scripps.edu/publications/public_pdf/107_art.pdf | doi=10.1097/01.ftd.0000179845.53213.39}}&lt;/ref&gt; for characterizing human metabolites was developed in the Siuzdak laboratory at [[The Scripps Research Institute]] and contained over 10,000 metabolites and tandem mass spectral data. {{As of|2015|09}}, METLIN contains over 240,000 metabolites as well as the largest repository of tandem mass spectrometry data in metabolomics.

On 23 January 2007, the [[Human Metabolome Project]], led by Dr. David Wishart of the [[University of Alberta]], Canada, completed the first draft of the human metabolome, consisting of a database of approximately 2500 metabolites, 1200 drugs and 3500 food components.&lt;ref name=Wishart2007&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wishart DS, Tzur D, Knox C, etal |title=HMDB: the Human Metabolome Database |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=35 |issue=Database issue |pages=D521–6 |date=January 2007 |pmid=17202168 |pmc=1899095 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkl923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wishart DS, Knox C, Guo AC, Eisner R, Young N, Gautam B, Hau DD, Psychogios N, Dong E, Bouatra S, Mandal R, Sinelnikov I, Xia J, Jia L, Cruz JA, Lim E, Sobsey CA, Shrivastava S, Huang P, Liu P, Fang L, Peng J, Fradette R, Cheng D, Tzur D, Clements M, Lewis A, De Souza A, Zuniga A, Dawe M, Xiong Y, Clive D, Greiner R, Nazyrova A, Shaykhutdinov R, Li L, Vogel HJ, Forsythe I |title=HMDB: a knowledgebase for the human metabolome |journal=[[Nucleic Acids Research]] |year= 2009 |pmid=18953024 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkn810 |url= |volume=37 |pages=D603–10 |issue=Database issue |pmc=2686599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar projects have been underway in several plant species, most notably ''[[Medicago truncatula]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1104/pp.107.108431| title = Metabolomics Reveals Novel Pathways and Differential Mechanistic and Elicitor-Specific Responses in Phenylpropanoid and Isoflavonoid Biosynthesis in Medicago truncatula Cell Cultures| journal = Plant Physiology| volume = 146| issue = 2| pages = 387–402| year = 2007| last1 = Farag | first1 = M.

==Metabolome==

{{see also|Metabolome|Human Metabolome Database}}
Metabolome refers to the complete set of small-molecule metabolites (such as metabolic intermediates, hormones and other signaling molecules, and secondary metabolites) to be found within a biological sample, such as a single organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oliver SG, Winson MK, Kell DB, Baganz F |title=Systematic functional analysis of the yeast genome |journal=Trends in Biotechnology |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=373–8 |date=September 1998 |pmid=9744112 |doi=10.1016/S0167-7799(98)01214-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Griffin JL, Vidal-Puig A |title=Current challenges in metabolomics for diabetes research: a vital functional genomic tool or just a ploy for gaining funding? |journal=Physiol.

Although the metabolome can be defined readily enough, it is not currently possible to analyse the entire range of metabolites by a single analytical method. The first metabolite database(called [[METLIN]]) for searching m/z values from mass spectrometry data was developed by scientists at [[The Scripps Research Institute]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="Smith CA, I'Maille G, Want EJ, Qin C, Trauger SA, Brandon TR, Custodio DE, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G 2005 747–51"/&gt; In January 2007, scientists at the [[University of Alberta]] and the [[University of Calgary]] completed the first draft of the human metabolome. The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) is perhaps the most extensive public metabolomic spectral database to date.&lt;ref&gt;HMDB 3.0 – the human metabolome database in 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The HMDB stores more than 40,000 different metabolite entries. They catalogued approximately 2500 [[metabolite]]s, 1200 [[drug]]s and 3500 food components that can be found in the human body, as reported in the literature.&lt;ref name=Wishart2007 /&gt; This information, available at the [[Human Metabolome Database]] (www.hmdb.ca) and based on analysis of information available in the current scientific literature, is far from complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pearson H |title=Meet the human metabolome |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue=7131 |page=8 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17330009 |doi=10.1038/446008a |url=|bibcode = 2007Natur.446....8P }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, much more is known about the metabolomes of other organisms. For example, over 50,000 metabolites have been characterized from the plant kingdom, and many thousands of metabolites have been identified and/or characterized from single plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Luca V, St Pierre B |title=The cell and developmental biology of alkaloid biosynthesis |journal=Trends Plant Sci. |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=168–73 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10740298 |doi= 10.1016/S1360-1385(00)01575-2|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Griffin JL, Shockcor JP |title=Metabolic profiles of cancer cells |journal=Nat.

Each type of cell and tissue has a unique metabolic ‘fingerprint’ that can elucidate organ or tissue-specific information, while the study of biofluids can give more generalized though less specialized information. Commonly used biofluids are urine and plasma, as they can be obtained non-invasively or relatively non-invasively, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holmes|first=E. |author2=I.D.

==Metabolites==
[[Metabolite]]s are the intermediates and products of [[metabolism]]. Within the context of metabolomics, a metabolite is usually defined as any molecule less than 1 kDa in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Samuelsson LM, Larsson DG |title=Contributions from metabolomics to fish research |journal=Mol Biosyst |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=974–9 |date=October 2008 |pmid=19082135 |doi=10.1039/b804196b |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are exceptions to this depending on the sample and detection method. For example, macromolecules such as [[lipoprotein]]s and [[albumin]] are reliably detected in NMR-based metabolomics studies of blood plasma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicholson JK, Foxall PJ, Spraul M, Farrant RD, Lindon JC |title=750 MHz 1H and 1H-13C NMR spectroscopy of human blood plasma |journal=Anal. Chem. |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=793–811 |date=March 1995 |pmid=7762816 |doi= 10.1021/ac00101a004|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In plant-based metabolomics, it is common to refer to "primary" and "secondary" metabolites. A primary metabolite is directly involved in the normal growth, development, and reproduction. A [[secondary metabolite]] is not directly involved in those processes, but usually has important [[Ecology|ecological]] function. Examples include [[antibiotics]] and [[pigment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bentley R |title=Secondary metabolite biosynthesis: the first century |journal=Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=1–40 |year=1999 |pmid=10230052 |doi=10.1080/0738-859991229189 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in human-based metabolomics, it is more common to describe metabolites as being either [[endogenous]] (produced by the host organism) or [[exogenous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nordström A, O'Maille G, Qin C, Siuzdak G |title=Nonlinear data alignment for UPLC-MS and HPLC-MS based metabolomics: quantitative analysis of endogenous and exogenous metabolites in human serum |journal=Anal.

The [[metabolome]] forms a large network of [[metabolic]] reactions, where outputs from one [[enzymatic]] [[chemical reaction]] are inputs to other chemical reactions. Such systems have been described as [[hypercycle (chemistry)|hypercycle]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Metabonomics== &lt;!-- This section is linked from redirect "[[Metabonomics]]" --&gt;
Metabonomics is defined as "the quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification". The word origin is from the Greek ''μεταβολή'' meaning change and ''nomos'' meaning a rule set or set of laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nicholson JK |title=Global systems biology, personalized medicine and molecular epidemiology |journal=Mol. Syst. Biol. |volume=2 |issue= 1|page=52 |year=2006 |pmid=17016518 |pmc=1682018 |doi=10.1038/msb4100095 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was pioneered by Jeremy Nicholson at [[Imperial College London]] and has been used in toxicology, disease diagnosis and a number of other fields.  Historically, the metabonomics approach was one of the first methods to apply the scope of systems biology to studies of metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicholson JK, Lindon JC, Holmes E |title='Metabonomics': understanding the metabolic responses of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli via multivariate statistical analysis of biological NMR spectroscopic data |journal=Xenobiotica |volume=29 |issue=11 |pages=1181–9 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10598751 |doi=10.1080/004982599238047 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicholson JK, Connelly J, Lindon JC, Holmes E |title=Metabonomics: a platform for studying drug toxicity and gene function |journal=Nat Rev Drug Discov |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=153–61 |date=February 2002 |pmid=12120097 |doi= 10.1038/nrd728|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holmes E, Wilson ID, Nicholson JK |title=Metabolic phenotyping in health and disease |journal=Cell |volume=134 |issue=5 |pages=714–7 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18775301 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.08.026 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some disagreement over the exact differences between 'metabolomics' and 'metabonomics'. The difference between the two terms is not related to choice of analytical platform: although metabonomics is more associated with [[NMR spectroscopy]] and metabolomics with [[mass spectrometry]]-based techniques, this is simply because of usages amongst different groups that have popularized the different terms. While there is still no absolute agreement, there is a growing consensus that 'metabolomics' places a greater emphasis on metabolic profiling at a cellular or organ level and is primarily concerned with normal endogenous metabolism. 'Metabonomics' extends metabolic profiling to include information about perturbations of metabolism caused by environmental factors (including diet and toxins), disease processes, and the involvement of extragenomic influences, such as [[gut microflora]]. This is not a trivial difference; metabolomic studies should, by definition, exclude metabolic contributions from extragenomic sources, because these are external to the system being studied. However, in practice, within the field of human disease research there is still a large degree of overlap in the way both terms are used, and they are often in effect synonymous.&lt;ref name = DGRref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robertson DG |title=Metabonomics in toxicology: a review |journal=Toxicol. Sci. |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=809–22 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15689416 |doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfi102 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exometabolomics==
{{main|Exometabolomics}}
Exometabolomics, or "metabolic footprinting", is the study of extracellular metabolites. It uses many techniques from other subfields of metabolomics, and has applications in [[biofuel]] development, [[bioprocessing]], determining drugs' [[mechanism of action]], and studying intercellular interactions.&lt;ref name="Silva"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Silva | first=Leslie P | last2=Northen | first2=Trent R | title=Exometabolomics and MSI | journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=34 | year=2015 | pages=209–216 | doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2015.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytical technologies==
[[File:Key_stages_of_a_metabolomics_study.png|thumb|right|Key stages of a metabolomics study]]

The typical workflow of metabolomics studies is shown in the figure. First, samples are collected from tissue, plasma, urine, saliva, cells, etc. Next, metabolites extracted often with the addition of internal standards and derivatization.&lt;ref&gt;Dettmer, K., Aronov, P. A. &amp; Hammock, B. D. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Mass Spectrom Rev 26, 51–78 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; During sample analysis, metabolites are quantified (LC or GC coupled with MS and/or NMR spectroscopy). The raw output data can be used for metabolite identification and further processed before statistical analysis (such as PCA). Many bioinformatic tools and software are available to identify associations with disease states and outcomes, determine significant correlations, and characterize metabolic signatures with existing biological knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmiena, A. A., Ng, T. W. &amp; Meikle, P. J. Metabolomics and ischaemic heart disease. Clinical Science 124, 289–306 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation methods===
Initially, analytes in a metabolomic sample comprise a highly complex mixture. This complex mixture can be simplified prior to detection by separating some analytes from others. Separation achieves various goals: analytes which cannot be resolved by the detector may be separated in this step; in MS analysis [[Ion suppression in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|ion suppression]] is reduced; the retention time of the analyte serves as information regarding its identity.  This separation step is not mandatory and is often omitted in NMR and "shotgun" based approaches such as [[shotgun lipidomics]].

[[Gas chromatography]] (GC), especially when interfaced with mass spectrometry ([[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry|GC-MS]]), is a widely used separation technique for metabolomic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ogbaga|first1=Chukwuma C.|last2=Stepien|first2=Piotr|last3=Dyson|first3=Beth C.|last4=Rattray|first4=Nicholas J. W.|last5=Ellis|first5=David I.|last6=Goodacre|first6=Royston|last7=Johnson|first7=Giles N.|title=Biochemical Analyses of Sorghum Varieties Reveal Differential Responses to Drought|journal=PLOS ONE|date=6 May 2016|volume=11|issue=5|pages=e0154423|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0154423|pmid=27153323|pmc=4859509|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1154423O}}&lt;/ref&gt; GC offers very high chromatographic resolution, and can be used in conjunction with a flame lionization detector (GC/FID) or a mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The method is especially useful for identification and quantification of small and volatile molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thermofisher.com/dk/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/mass-spectrometry-learning-center/gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry-gc-ms-information.html|title=Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) Information {{!}} Thermo Fisher Scientific - US|website=www.thermofisher.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a practical limitation of GC is the requirement of chemical derivatization for many biomolecules as only volatile chemicals can be analysed without derivatization. In cases where greater resolving power is required, two-dimentional chromatography ([[GCxGC]]) can be applied.

[[High performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC) has emerged as the most common separation technique for metabolomic analysis. With the advent of [[electrospray ionization]], HPLC was coupled to MS. In contrast with [[Gas-liquid chromatography|GC]], HPLC has lower chromatographic resolution, but requires no derivitization for polar molecules, has no MW limitations, and separates molecules in the liquid phase. Additionally HPLC has the advantage that a much wider range of analytes can be measured with a higher sensitivity than GC methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gika HG, Theodoridis GA, Wingate JE, Wilson ID |title=Within-day reproducibility of an LC-MS-based method for metabonomic analysis: application to human urine |journal=J.

[[Capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) has a higher theoretical separation efficiency than HPLC (although requiring much more time per separation), and is suitable for use with a wider range of metabolite classes than is GC. As for all electrophoretic techniques, it is most appropriate for charged analytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Soga T, Ohashi Y, Ueno Y |title=Quantitative metabolome analysis using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry |journal=J.

===Detection methods===
[[File:Comparison_of_most_common_used_metabolomics_methods.png|thumb|right|Comparison of most common used metabolomics methods]]
[[Mass spectrometry]] (MS) is used to identify and to quantify metabolites after optional separation by [[Gas chromatography|GC]], [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] ([[Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|LC-MS]]), or [[Capillary electrophoresis|CE]]. [[GC-MS]] was the first hyphenated technique to be developed. Identification leverages the distinct patterns in which analytes fragment which can be thought of as a mass spectral fingerprint; libraries exist that allow identification of a metabolite according to this [[fragmentation pattern]]. MS is both sensitive and can be very specific. There are also a number of techniques which use MS as a stand-alone technology: the sample is infused directly into the mass spectrometer with no prior separation, and the MS provides sufficient selectivity to both separate and to detect metabolites.

For analysis by mass spectrometry the analytes must be imparted with a charge and transferred to the gas phase. [[Electron ionization]] (EI) is the most common ionization technique applies to GC separations as it is amenable to low pressures.  EI also produces fragmentation of the analyte, both providing structural information while increasing the complexity of the data and possibly obscuring the molecular ion. [[Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization]] (APCI) is an atmospheric pressure technique that can be applied to all the above separation techniques.  APCI is a gas phase ionization method slightly more aggressive ionization than ESI which is suitable for less polar compounds. [[Electrospray ionization]] (ESI) is the most common ionization technique applied in LC/MS. This soft ionization is most successful for polar molecules with ionizable functional groups.

Surface-based mass analysis has seen a resurgence in the past decade, with new MS technologies focused on increasing sensitivity, minimizing background, and reducing sample preparation.  The ability to analyze metabolites directly from biofluids and tissues continues to challenge current MS technology, largely because of the limits imposed by the complexity of these samples, which contain thousands to tens of thousands of metabolites.  Among the technologies being developed to address this challenge is Nanostructure-Initiator MS (NIMS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Northen T.R |author2=Yanes O |author3=Northen M |author4=Marrinucci D |author5=Uritboonthai W |author6=Apon J |author7=Golledge S |author8=Nordstrom A |author9=Siuzdak G |title=Clathrate nanostructures for mass spectrometry |volume=449 |issue=7165 |pages=1033–6 |date=October 2007 |journal=Nature  |pmid=17960240 |doi=10.1038/nature06195 |url=|bibcode = 2007Natur.449.1033N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woo H, Northen TR, Yanes O, Siuzdak G |title=Nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry: a protocol for preparing and applying NIMS surfaces for high-sensitivity mass analysis |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=1341–9 |date=July 2008 |journal=Nature Protocols  |pmid=18714302 |doi=10.1038/NPROT.2008.110 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a desorption/ ionization approach that does not require the application of matrix and thereby facilitates small-molecule (i.e., metabolite) identification. [[MALDI]] is also used however, the application of a MALDI matrix can add significant background at &lt;1000 Da that complicates analysis of the low-mass range (i.e., metabolites). In addition, the size of the resulting matrix crystals limits the spatial resolution that can be achieved in tissue imaging. Because of these limitations, several other matrix-free desorption/ionization approaches have been applied to the analysis of biofluids and tissues.

[[Secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS) was one of the first matrix-free desorption/ionization approaches used to analyze metabolites from biological samples.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} SIMS uses a high-energy primary ion beam to desorb and generate secondary ions from a surface. The primary advantage of SIMS is its high spatial resolution (as small as 50&amp;nbsp;nm), a powerful characteristic for tissue imaging with MS. However, SIMS has yet to be readily applied to the analysis of biofluids and tissues because of its limited sensitivity at &gt;500 Da and analyte fragmentation generated by the high-energy primary ion beam. [[Desorption electrospray ionization]] (DESI) is a matrix-free technique for analyzing biological samples that uses a charged solvent spray to desorb ions from a surface. Advantages of DESI are that no special surface is required and the analysis is performed at ambient pressure with full access to the sample during acquisition.  A limitation of DESI is spatial resolution because "focusing" the charged solvent spray is difficult. However, a recent development termed [[Laser Ablation Electrospray Ionization|laser ablation ESI]] (LAESI) is a promising approach to circumvent this limitation.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) spectroscopy is the only detection technique which does not rely on separation of the analytes, and the sample can thus be recovered for further analyses. All kinds of small molecule metabolites can be measured simultaneously - in this sense, NMR is close to being a universal detector. The main advantages of NMR are high analytical reproducibility and simplicity of sample preparation. Practically, however, it is relatively insensitive compared to mass spectrometry-based techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Griffin JL |title=Metabonomics: NMR spectroscopy and pattern recognition analysis of body fluids and tissues for characterisation of xenobiotic toxicity and disease diagnosis |journal=Curr Opin Chem Biol |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=648–54 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14580571 |doi= 10.1016/j.cbpa.2003.08.008|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Beckonert O, Keun HC, Ebbels TM, etal |title=Metabolic profiling, metabolomic and metabonomic procedures for NMR spectroscopy of urine, plasma, serum and tissue extracts |journal=Nat Protoc |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=2692–703 |year=2007 |pmid=18007604 |doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.376 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparison of most common used metabolomics methods is shown in the table.

Although NMR and MS are the most widely used, modern day techniques other methods of detection that have been used. These include [[ion-mobility spectrometry]], electrochemical detection (coupled to HPLC), Raman spectroscopy and radiolabel (when combined with thin-layer chromatography).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Statistical methods==
[[File:Software_List_for_Metabolomic_Analysis.png|thumb|right|Software List for Metabolomic Analysis]]
The data generated in metabolomics usually consist of measurements performed on subjects under various conditions. These measurements may be digitized spectra, or a list of metabolite levels. In its simplest form this generates a matrix with rows corresponding to subjects and columns corresponding with metabolite levels.&lt;ref name="VDGarticle"/&gt; Several statistical programs are currently available for analysis of both NMR and [[mass spectrometry]] data.  A great number of free software packages are already available for the analysis of metabolomics data shows in the table. Some statistical tools listed in the table were designed for NMR data analyses were also useful for MS data.&lt;ref name="Sugimoto, M. 2012"&gt;Sugimoto, M., Kawakami, M., Robert, M., Soga, T. &amp; Tomita, M. Bioinformatics Tools for Mass Spectroscopy-Based Metabolomic Data Processing and Analysis. Curr Bioinform 7, 96–108 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; For mass spectrometry data, software is available that identifies molecules that vary in subject groups on the basis of mass and sometimes retention time depending on the experimental design.  The first comprehensive software to analyze global mass spectrometry-based metabolomics datasets was developed by the Siuzdak laboratory at [[The Scripps Research Institute]] in 2006.  This software, called XCMS, is freely available, has over 20,000 downloads since its inception in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith CA, Want EJ, O'Maille G, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G |title=XCMS: processing mass spectrometry data for metabolite profiling using nonlinear peak alignment, matching, and identification |journal=Anal Chem |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=779–87 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16448051 |doi=10.1021/ac051437y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the most widely cited mass spectrometry-based metabolomics software programs in scientific literature.  XCMS has now been surpassed in usage by a cloud-based version of XCMS called XCMS Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tautenhahn R, Patti GJ, Rinehart D, Siuzdak G |title=XCMS Online: a web-based platform to process untargeted metabolomic data |journal=Anal Chem |volume=84 |issue=11 |pages=5035–5039 |date=April 2012 |pmid=22533540 |doi=10.1021/ac300698c |pmc=3703953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patti GJ, Tautenhahn R, Rinehart D, Cho K, Shriver L, Manchester M, Nikolskiy I, Johnson C, Mahieu N, Siuzdak G |title=A View from Above: Cloud Plots to Visualize Global Metabolomic Data |journal=Anal Chem |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=798–804 |year=2013 |pmid= |doi=10.1021/ac3029745|pmc=3716252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available through an open source software project Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/) or METLIN metabolomics database (http://metlin.scripps.edu/download/). The software is capable of non-linear retention time alignment, peak picking, and relative quantitation and works with universal netCDF file format.
&lt;ref&gt;MASS SPECTROMETRY-BASED METABOLOMICS&lt;/ref&gt; XCMS can identify hundreds of endogenous metabolites/ biomarkers and calculated a nonlinear retention time correction profiles for each sample. The advantages of XCMS were the software incorporated new nonlinear retention time alignment, matched filtration, peak detection and matching.&lt;ref name="Sugimoto, M. 2012"/&gt; Other popular metabolomics programs for mass spectral analysis are MZmine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katajamaa M, Miettinen J, Oresic M |title=MZmine: toolbox for processing and visualization of mass spectrometry based molecular profile data |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=634–36 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16403790 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btk039 |url=http://mzmine.sourceforge.net/download.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; MetAlign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lommen A |title=MetAlign: interface-driven, versatile metabolomics tool for hyphenated full-scan mass spectrometry data processing |journal=Anal Chem |volume=81 |issue=8 |pages=3079–86 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19301908 |doi=10.1021/ac900036d |url=http://www.metalign.wur.nl/UK/Download+and+publications/}}&lt;/ref&gt; MathDAMP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baran R, Kochi H, Saito N, Suematsu M, Soga T, Nishioka T, Robert M, Tomita M |title=MathDAMP: a package for differential analysis of metabolite profiles |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=7 |page=530 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17166258 |pmc=1764210 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-7-530 |url=http://mathdamp.iab.keio.ac.jp/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also compensate for retention time deviation during sample analysis.

It combines xcms package functions and can be used to apply many statistical functions for correcting [[dead time|detector saturation]] using coates correction and creating heat plots. Metabolomics data may also be analyzed by statistical projection ([[chemometrics]]) methods such as [[principal components analysis]] and [[partial least squares regression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trygg J, Holmes E, Lundstedt T |title=Chemometrics in metabonomics |journal=J. Proteome Res. |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=469–79 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17269704 |doi=10.1021/pr060594q |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once metabolic composition is determined, data reduction techniques can be used to elucidate patterns and connections. In many studies, including those evaluating drug-toxicity and some disease models, the metabolites of interest are not known ''a priori''. This makes unsupervised methods, those with no prior assumptions of class membership, a popular first choice. The most common of these methods includes [[principal component analysis]] (PCA) which can efficiently reduce the dimensions of a dataset to a few which explain the greatest variation.&lt;ref name="Nicholson 2003 668–676"/&gt; When analyzed in the lower-dimensional PCA space, clustering of samples with similar metabolic fingerprints can be detected. PCA algorithms aim to replace all correlated variables by a much smaller number of uncorrelated variables (referred to as principal components (PCs)) and retain most of the information in the original dataset.&lt;ref&gt;Computational and statistical analysis of metabolomics data&lt;/ref&gt; This clustering can elucidate patterns and assist in the determination of disease biomarkers - metabolites that correlate most with class membership.

==Key applications==
[[Toxicity]] assessment/[[toxicology]] by metabolic profiling (especially of urine or blood plasma samples) detects the physiological changes caused by toxic insult of a chemical (or mixture of chemicals). In many cases, the observed changes can be related to specific syndromes, e.g. a specific lesion in liver or kidney. This is of particular relevance to pharmaceutical companies wanting to test the toxicity of potential [[medication|drug]] candidates: if a compound can be eliminated before it reaches [[clinical trial]]s on the grounds of adverse toxicity, it saves the enormous expense of the trials.&lt;ref name=DGRref/&gt;

For [[functional genomics]], metabolomics can be an excellent tool for determining the [[phenotype]] caused by a genetic manipulation, such as gene deletion or insertion. Sometimes this can be a sufficient goal in itself—for instance, to detect any phenotypic changes in a genetically modified plant intended for human or animal consumption. More exciting is the prospect of predicting the function of unknown [[gene]]s by comparison with the metabolic perturbations caused by deletion/insertion of known genes. Such advances are most likely to come from [[model organism]]s such as ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. The [[Benjamin Cravatt III|Cravatt laboratory]] at [[The Scripps Research Institute]] has recently applied this technology to [[mammal]]ian systems, identifying the ''N''-acyltaurines as previously uncharacterized endogenous substrates for the enzyme [[fatty acid amide hydrolase]] (FAAH) and the monoalkylglycerol ethers (MAGEs) as endogenous substrates for the uncharacterized [[hydrolase]] [[KIAA1363]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saghatelian A, Trauger SA, Want EJ, Hawkins EG, Siuzdak G, Cravatt BF |title=Assignment of endogenous substrates to enzymes by global metabolite profiling |journal=Biochemistry |volume=43 |issue=45 |pages=14332–9 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15533037 |doi=10.1021/bi0480335 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chiang KP, Niessen S, Saghatelian A, Cravatt BF |title=An enzyme that regulates ether lipid signaling pathways in cancer annotated by multidimensional profiling |journal=Chem. Biol. |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=1041–50 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17052608 |doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.08.008 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metabologenomics is a novel approach to integrate metabolomics and genomics data by correlating microbial-exported metabolites with predicted biosynthetic genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goering|first=Anthony W.|last2=McClure|first2=Ryan A.|last3=Doroghazi|first3=James R.|last4=Albright|first4=Jessica C.|last5=Haverland|first5=Nicole A.|last6=Zhang|first6=Yongbo|last7=Ju|first7=Kou-San|last8=Thomson|first8=Regan J.|last9=Metcalf|first9=William W.|date=2016-02-24|title=Metabologenomics: Correlation of Microbial Gene Clusters with Metabolites Drives Discovery of a Nonribosomal Peptide with an Unusual Amino Acid Monomer|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.5b00331|journal=ACS Central Science|volume=2|issue=2|pages=99–108|doi=10.1021/acscentsci.5b00331|issn=2374-7943}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bioinformatics-based pairing method enables natural product discovery at a larger-scale by refining non-targeted metabolomic analyses to identify small molecules with related biosynthesis and to focus on those that may not have previously well known structures.

[[Fluxomics]] is a further development of metabolomics. The disadvantage of metabolomics is that it only provides the user with steady-state level information, while fluxomics determines the reaction rates of metabolic reactions and can trace metabolites in a biological system over time. 

[[Nutrigenomics]] is a generalised term which links genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics to human nutrition. In general a metabolome in a given body fluid is influenced by endogenous factors such as age, sex, body composition and genetics as well as underlying pathologies. The large bowel microflora are also a very significant potential confounder of metabolic profiles and could be classified as either an endogenous or exogenous factor. The main exogenous factors are diet and drugs. Diet can then be broken down to nutrients and non- nutrients.  Metabolomics is one means to determine a biological endpoint, or metabolic fingerprint, which reflects the balance of all these forces on an individual's metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gibney MJ, Walsh M, Brennan L, Roche HM, German B, van Ommen B |title=Metabolomics in human nutrition: opportunities and challenges |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=497–503 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16155259 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English language [[metre (poetry)|poetic metres]] and hymn metres have different starting points but there is nevertheless much overlap. Take the opening lines of the hymn ''[[Amazing Grace]]'':
:A'''maz'''ing '''grace''', how '''sweet''' the '''sound'''
:that '''saved''' a '''wretch''' like '''me'''.
Analyzing this, a poet would see a [[couplet]] with four [[Iamb (poetry)|iambic]] [[Foot (prosody)|metrical feet]] in the first line and three in the second. A musician would more likely count eight syllables in the first line and six in the second.

Completing that verse:
:A'''maz'''ing '''grace''', how '''sweet''' the '''sound'''
:that '''saved''' a '''wretch''' like '''me'''.
:I '''once''' was '''lost''', but '''now''' am '''found''',
:was '''blind''', but '''now''' I '''see'''.
the hymnist describes it as 8.6.8.6 (or 86.86).

Conventionally most hymns in this 86.86 pattern are iambic (weak-strong syllable pairs).  By contrast most hymns in an 87.87 pattern are [[trochee|trochaic]], with strong-weak syllable pairs:
:'''Love''' di'''vine''', all '''loves''' ex'''cel'''ling,
:'''joy''' of '''heav'n''' to '''earth''' come '''down''',...

In practice many hymns conform to one of a relatively small number of metres (syllable patterns), and within the most commonly used ones there is a general convention as to whether its stress pattern is iambic or trochaic (or perhaps [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]]). It is rare to find any significant [[substitution (poetry)|metrical substitution]] in a well-written hymn; indeed, such variation usually indicates a poorly constructed text.

==Representation==
All metres can be represented numerically.  In addition, some of those most frequently encountered are named:
*'''C.M.''', or '''CM'''&amp;mdash; [[Common metre]], 8.6.8.6; a quatrain (four-line stanza) with alternating lines of iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter, which rhymes in the second and fourth lines and sometimes in the first and third.
*'''H.M.''', or '''HM'''&amp;mdash; [[Hallelujah meter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hymntime.com/tch/mid/met/HM.htm |title=HM Hallelujah Meter (66.66.88) |last= |first= |date=19 October 2018 |website= |publisher=The Cyber Hymnal |access-date=29 November 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 66.66.88;
*'''L.M.''', or '''LM'''&amp;mdash; [[Long metre]], 8.8.8.8; a quatrain in iambic tetrameter, which rhymes in the second and fourth lines and often in the first and third.
*'''S.M.''', or '''SM'''&amp;mdash; [[Meter (hymn)|Short metre]], 6.6.8.6; iambic lines in the first, second, and fourth are in trimeter, and the third in tetrameter, which rhymes in the second and fourth lines and sometimes in the first and third. "Blest Be the Tie that Binds" is an example of a hymn in short metre.
Often a longer verse will, in effect, be two short verses joined together or doubled. So:
*'''D.C.M.''' (also '''C.M.D.''', or '''CMD''')&amp;mdash;Doubled CM, 8.6.8.6.8.6.8.6.
*'''8.7.8.7.D'''&amp;mdash;equivalent to two verses of 8.7.8.7. [[Trochee|Trochaic]] or [[Iamb (poetry)|Iambic]].

Additionally, '''P.M.''', or '''PM''' is used to indicate a ''Peculiar meter'', where the regular count of syllables is not adhered to.

A large number of hymns, including many well known ones, use other metres, for example, "[[Abide With Me]]" (10.10.10.10) and "Come Down, O Love Divine" (6.6.11.D).

==Metrical index==
Hymns written in a particular meter may be sung to any tune in that same meter, as long as the [[Foot (prosody)|poetic foot]] (such as [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]], [[trochee|trochaic]]) also conforms.

Most hymnals include a metrical index of the book's tunes.

A '''''ménage à trois''''' ({{lang-en|"household of three"}}) is a domestic arrangement in which three people have [[romance (love)|romantic]] or [[sexual relations]] with each other, typically occupying the same household. A form of [[polyamory]], contemporary arrangements are sometimes identified as a '''throuple'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/throuple-meaning-what-you-do-in-a-three-person-relationship_uk_5798ba5be4b0796a0b611e7a Throuple Relationships vs Threesomes Explained: What It's Like To Be In A Three-Person Romance], ''[[HuffPost]]'', 2016 July 28.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''thruple'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/11/22/this-thruple-of-two-men-and-a-woman-want-to-adopt-kids/ A thruple of a married male couple and their girlfriend want to have kids], ''[[PinkNews]]'', 2017 November 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical instances==
&lt;!-- sorted in chronological order, where possible --&gt;

History has a number of examples of ''ménages à trois'' relationships.

Speculation exists that, in 1547–48, Queen [[Catherine Parr]], widow of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and her fourth husband [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]] were involved in a ''ménage'' with the future [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].  This is probably exaggerated, although  episodes of sexually charged horseplay involving the three were well attested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David |last=Starkey |authorlink=David Starkey |date=2000-04-27 |title=Elizabeth |isbn=0-7011-6939-7 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Linda |last=Porter |authorlink=Linda Porter (historian) |date=2010-03-19 |title=Katherine the Queen: The Remarkable Life of Katherine Parr |isbn=0-230-71039-5 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his youth, thirteen years her junior, the French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was a [[Wiktionary:protégé|protégé]] of the French noblewoman [[Françoise-Louise de Warens]], who would become his first lover. He lived with her at her estate on and off since his teenage years, and in 1732, after he reached the age of 20, she initiated a sexual relationship with him while also being open about her sexual involvement with the steward of her house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Rousseau|first=Jean-Jacques|title=Confessions|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-31500-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German intellectual [[Dorothea von Rodde-Schlözer]], her husband Mattheus Rodde and the French philosopher [[Charles de Villers]] also had a ''ménage à trois'' from 1794 until her husband's death in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Poulet|first=Anne L. |title=Jean-Antoine Houdon: Sculptor of the Enlightenment |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2003-12-12 |page=319 |chapter=Dorothea von Rodde-Schlözer (1770–1825) |isbn=0-226-67647-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EV0BgrzV-fkC&amp;pg=PA319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]] (British ambassador to Naples), his wife [[Emma Hamilton]], and her lover, the naval hero Admiral Horatio [[Lord Nelson]], were in a ''ménage à trois'' from 1799 until Nelson's death in 1805.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Constantine |first=David |authorlink=David Constantine |date=2001-03-08 |title=Fields of Fire: a life of Sir William Hamilton |page=242 et seq. |location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |isbn=1-84212-581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the age of 16, in 1813, the future author of [[Frankenstein]], [[Mary Shelley|Mary Godwin]], eloped with her to-be husband [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and engaged in a ''ménage'' with [[Claire Clairmont]], future lover of [[Lord Byron]], with whom the Shelleys would later have an extensive relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Who's who in British History: A-H|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fLeeV-mqlJMC&amp;pg=PA1115|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|date = 1998-01-01|isbn = 9781884964909|language = en|first = Geoffrey Russell Richards|last = Treasure|page = 1115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political philosopher [[Friedrich Engels]] lived in a ''ménage à trois'' with his mistress Mary Burns and her sister Lizzie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hands|first1=Gill|title=Marx: A complete introduction|date=2015|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9781473608696|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882 the Russian-born psychoanalyst and author [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]] invited the German philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Paul Rée]] to live with her, both of whom were in love with her. She kept her relationship with the two men celibate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Hollingdale |first=R. J. |author-link=R. J.

In 1913, [[psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]] began a relationship with a young patient, [[Toni Wolff]], which lasted for some decades.

The Russian and Soviet poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] lived with [[Lilya Brik]], who was considered his muse, and her husband [[Osip Brik]], an ''avant garde'' writer and critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Gray |first=du Plessix Gray |authorlink=Francine du Plessix Gray |date=2006-06-06 |title=Them: A Memoir of Parents

[[File:At the nudist beach.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A group of naturists at a [[nude beach]] in [[Crimea]], 2008]]
'''Naturism''', or '''nudism''', is a [[cultural movement|cultural]] and [[political movement]] practicing, advocating, and defending personal and social [[nudity]], most but not all of which takes place on private property. The term may also refer to a lifestyle based on personal, family, or social nudism.{{sfn|Choin|2002}} Naturism may take a number of forms. It may be practiced individually, within a family, socially, or in public. Additionally, there is also militant naturism, including campaigning, and extreme naturism is sometimes considered a separate category.{{sfn|Descamps|1987}}

== Definition and lexicology ==
The XIV Congress of the [[International Naturist Federation]] ([[Cap d'Agde|Agde]], [[France]], 1974) defined naturism as:

: ''a way of life in [[harmony]] with [[nature]] characterised by the practice of [[#Social_nudism|communal nudity]] with the intention of encouraging [[self-respect]], respect for others and for the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref name="Definition"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deschênes|first1=Stéphane|title=The Official INF-FNI Definition of Naturism|url=http://www.inf-fni.org/content/download/28259/1110928/file/Official%20INF-FNI%20Definition%20Of%20Naturism.pdf|website=INF-FNI|publisher=International Naturist Federation|accessdate=11 January 2016|format=PDF|date=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''
Several other terms ("social nudity", "[[public nudity]]", "[[skinny dipping]]", "sunning", and "clothes-free") have been proposed as alternative terms for naturism, but none has found the same widespread public acceptance as the older terms "naturism" and (in much of the United States) "nudism".

People interested in social nudity can attend [[nude beach|clothes-free beaches]] and other types of ad-hoc nudist events. At these venues, participants generally need not belong to a [[nudist club]].

Many contemporary naturists and naturist organisations feel that the practice of social nudity should be asexual. For various social, cultural, and historical reasons the lay public, the media, and many contemporary naturists and their organisations often oversimplify the relationship between naturism and sexuality. Current research has begun to explore this complex relationship.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

[[File:Zwembad op naturistenterrein.JPG|thumb|Sign at a naturist [[swimming pool]] with a warning that no clothing (including underwear) is permitted.]]

The International Naturist Federation explains:

: '' "Each country has its own kind of naturism, and even each club has its own special character, for we too, human beings, have each our own character which is reflected in our surroundings."''{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}}{{efn|The Hannover based ''Bund für freies Lebensgestaltung'' wrote "Naturism is a new lifestyle caring for the body, the soul and the spirit in society. We live the ideal of freedom, conscious of its limits, taking up our responsibility. The expression of our will is nudity, our admission of sincerity.}}

The usage and definition of these terms varies geographically and historically.{{efn|In his book, ''Cinema Au Naturel'',{{sfn|Storey|2003|p=11}} author [[Mark Storey]] states "two related terms that we will continually run across are ''nudist'' and ''naturist''. Although, the meanings of the two terms are virtually identical, they often have different connotations for those who prefer one to the other. In America people who believe that it is physically, socially, emotionally, and perhaps spiritually healthy to go about fully nude individually and in groups of mixed sex whenever weather permits and others are not offended generally refer to themselves as "nudists". In Europe such people more often than not refer to themselves as "naturists".}} Though in the United States, naturism and nudism have the same meaning,{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} in Britain there is a clear distinction.{{efn|The English version of the Agde definition was translated differently in ''Guide Mondial de Naturisme 96 97''.{{sfn|Anon|1997|p=}} ''Naturism (American "nudism") is a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of communal nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and the environment.''}}

Nudism is the ''act of being naked'', while naturism is a ''lifestyle'' which at various times embraced nature, environment, respect for others, self-respect, crafts, healthy eating, vegetarianism, teetotalism, non-smoking, yoga, physical exercise and pacifism as well as nudity.{{efn|Ray Connett, Sunny Trails, in Sunbathing for Health Sept 1947 p 8, July 1957 p 14 writes that Naturism is a weasel word that can mean anything}}{{efn|Presently, [[Mark Storey]] is authoring an article detailing historical use of the terms naturism and nudism and how they differ between different cultures, countries, and time periods in history. In a telephone interview by Daniel Johnson on 15 April 2006 with Storey he stated that "a draft of the piece was posted on the "References" page of [[The Naturist Society]] [http://naturistsociety.com/ web site] for a few weeks". At the time of its former release in October 2004 it was titled ''Naturism, Nudism, or Nameless? A History of Terms'' He is planning on publishing a revised article as soon as additional information and errors are corrected.}}

In naturist parlance, ''[[wikt:textile|textile]]'' or ''textilist'' is a non-naturist person, non-naturist behaviour or non-naturist facilities. e.g. ''the textile beach starts at the flag'', ''they are a mixed couple&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; he is naturist, she is textile''.  ''Textile'' is the predominant term used in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] ('textilist' is unknown in British naturist magazines including ''[[H&amp;E naturist]]''), although some naturists avoid it due to perceived negative or derogatory connotations.  ''Textilist'' is said to be used interchangeably, but no dictionary definition to this effect exists, nor are there any equivalent examples of use in mainstream literature such as those for ''textile''.{{sfn|Mars-Jones|1991|p=152}} ''Clothing optional'' and ''nude optional'' (US specific) describe a policy or a venue that allows or encourages nudity but tolerates the wearing of clothes. The opposite is ''clothing compulsory''; that is, prohibiting nudity. Adjectival phrases ''clothes free'' and ''clothing free'' prescribe where naturism is permitted in an otherwise textile environment, or define the preferred state of a naturist.

The social nudity movement includes a large range of variants including "naturism", "nudism", "[[Freikörperkultur]] (FKK)", the "[[nude beach|free beach]] movement" as well as generalized "public lands/[[public nudity]]" advocacy. There is a large amount of shared history and common themes, issues and philosophy, but differences between these separate movements remain contentious.

{{Main|Nudity#Private nudity}}
Many people are often nude in the privacy of their home or garden, either alone or with members of the family; naturists normally refer to them as at-home-nudists or closet-nudists. This may be occasional nudity or as a naturist lifestyle. There are differences of opinion as to whether, and if so to what extent, parents should appear naked in front of their children, and whether children should be nude within the home in the view of their family as well as visitors. This has attracted a great deal of academic study.

A United States study by [[Alfred Kinsey]] (1948&amp;ndash;1953) found that 75% of the participants stated that there was never nudity in the home when they were growing up, 5% of the participants said that there was "seldom" nudity in the home, 3% said "often", and 17% said that it was "usual". The study found that there was no significant difference between what was reported by men and by women with respect to frequency of nudity in the home.{{sfn|Bancroft|2003|p=}}

&lt;!-- Do not remove these images, Wikipedia is not censored and the current consensus is for this article to have images --&gt;
Gordon and Schroeder in 1995 reported that parental nudity varies considerably from family to family. They say that "there is nothing inherently wrong with bathing with children or otherwise appearing naked in front of them", noting that doing so may provide an opportunity for parents to provide important information. They note that by ages 5 to 6 children begin to develop a sense of modesty, and recommend to parents who wish to be sensitive to their children's wishes that they limit such activities from that age onwards.{{sfn|Gordon &amp; Schroeder|1995|p=16}}

Barbara Bonner in 1999 cautioned against nudity in the home if children exhibit sexual play of a type that is considered problematic.{{sfn|Bonner|2000|p=209-}}

In a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect.{{sfn|Okami|1995}} Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.{{sfn|Okami et al|1998}}

Smith and Sparks in their study on the effects of social nudity on children conclude that "the viewing of the unclothed body, far from being destructive to the psyche, seems to be either benign and totally harmless or to actually provide positive benefits to the individuals involved.{{sfn|Smith|Sparks|1986|p=183}}

== Social nudism ==
{{See also|Exhibitionism}}

The rhetoric of the nudism and anti-nudism movements emphasizes freedom from many of the normal constraints which regulate human interaction in nudist settings, although for different reasons. Using data from French and German beaches, this hypothesis was tested using five different indicators. Little significant variation between nudists and non-nudists within French and German settings is found in their patterns of interactional spacing, while more significant main effects for differences of cultures are found regardless of nudity status. As a subculture, nudists would appear to differ from nonnudists only in their propensity to like to sunbathe in the nude. Their nude status would appear to have none of the de-inhibiting effects often attributed to nudism. By contrast, clear cultural differences between German and French cultures are shown consistent with [[High- and low-context cultures|Hall's high-low context distinction]] and the [[Robert T. Francoeur|Francoeur]]'s hot-cool sexuality continuum.{{sfn|Smith|1980}}

=== Naturist facilities ===

At naturist organised events or venues clothing is usually optional, except by swimming pools or sunbathing lawns where complete nudity is expected, weather permitting. This rule is sometimes a source of controversy among some naturists. Staff at a naturist facility are usually required to be clothed due to health and safety regulations.{{sfn|Descamps|1987}}

Facilities for naturists are classified in various ways. A landed or members' naturist club is one that owns its own facilities, while non-landed (or travel) clubs meet at various locations, such as private residences, swimming pools, hot springs, landed clubs and resorts, and rented facilities. Landed clubs can be run by members on democratic lines or by one or more owners who make the rules. In either case, they can determine membership criteria and the obligations of members. This usually involves sharing work necessary to maintain or develop the site.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

[[File:Outdoor bathing at Jhiben Hot Spring 20121110.jpg|thumb|Families bathing nude at a hot spring in Taiwan]] &lt;!-- Can we crop this to remove triangle --&gt;

Some clubs have stricter entrance requirements than some traditional 'country clubs', including the requirement to supply references, a sponsoring member, a trial membership, committee approval or, criminal background checks. UK clubs are now required to have child-protection policies in place, and designated child-protection officers. Many clubs promote frequent social activities.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The international naturist organizations were mainly composed of representatives of landed clubs.{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}} [[Nudist colony]] is no longer a favored term, but it is used by naturists as a term of derision for landed clubs that have rigid non-inclusive membership criteria, and in meta-data on naturist websites.

A holiday centre is a facility that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. The center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most holiday centers expect visitors to hold an [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] card, that is, be a member of their national organization, but some have relaxed this restriction, relying on the carrying of a trade card. Holiday centers can be quite small, just a couple of hectares or large occupying over 300 hectares.{{efn|The three biggest centres on the [[Médoc]] are Euronat 335 ha, CHM 175 ha with a 3 km beach, and La Jenny 127 ha}} In a large holiday centre there will be swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids' clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some holiday centres allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same families will visit each year.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} Holiday centres are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}}

A naturist resort is, to a European, an essentially urban development where naturism is the norm. [[Cap d'Agde]] in France, naturist village [[Charco del Palo]] on Lanzarote, Canary Islands, [[Vera, Spain|Vera Playa]] in Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Vera Playa history article|url=http://www.veraplaya.info/history.html|accessdate=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vritomartis{{sfn|Schneider|2009|p=41}} in Greece are examples. Some residents use these resorts as a year-round home.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In US usage, a naturist resort can mean a holiday centre.&lt;ref name="PalmSprings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnyfun.com/faq.html |title=For a relaxed explanation |publisher=Sunnyfun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308025528/http://sunnyfun.com/faq.html |archivedate=2013-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freikörperkultur]] (FKK) literally translated as 'free body culture' is the name for the general movement in [[Germany]]. The abbreviation is widely recognised all over Europe and often found on informal signs indicating the direction to a remote naturist beach.

=== Nude beaches ===
[[File:Chihuahua20 01 2007 2.jpg|thumb|A sign at a nude beach in Maldonado, Uruguay]]

Clothing is optional at [[nude beach]]es (or "free beaches"). A feature of bathing on a nude beach is the anonymity it offers, with membership of a club not being required, nor detailed application processes, nor pre-booking of visits.{{Original research inline|date=September 2014}}{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Naturism and sports ===
{{see also|Nude recreation|Nudity in sport}}

Naturism encourages a healthy life style, and many naturist clubs at times organize and encourage members to take part in local and international sport events and competitions. The [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|German Association for Free Body Culture (DFK)]]  promotes recreational sports and is a member of the [[German Olympic Sport Federation]] ([[DOSB]]).

=== Festival naturism ===
[[File:People pix in the village.jpg|thumb|Naturist couple at the [[Nambassa]] festival, New Zealand, 1981]]

From [[Woodstock]] to [[Edinburgh Festival|Edinburgh]], and [[Nambassa]] in the southern hemisphere communal nudity is commonly recorded at music and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] festivals.

The series of 1970s [[Nambassa]] [[hippie]] festivals held in New Zealand is a further example of non-sexualized naturism. Of the 75,000 patrons who attended the 1979 Nambassa 3 day [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] Festival an estimated 35% of festival attendees spontaneously chose to remove their clothing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nambassa.com/johnlowe.html |title=Public nudity at Nambassa |publisher=Nambassa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferring complete or partial nudity.{{sfn|Jones &amp; Broadley|1979|p=}}'

[[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde festival]] in Denmark hosts a naked run, that has become one of the most popular events there.

===Summer naturism===
The prevalence of naturism tends to increase during the summer months especially when the temperature is higher with some regions experiencing first-time naturists and people who have transitioned to becoming a naturist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLellan | first1 = Josie | year = 2007 | title = State socialist bodies: East German nudism from ban to boom | url = | journal = The Journal of Modern History | volume = 79 | issue = 1| pages = 48–79 | doi=10.1086/517544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have observed that among some of these naturists, they are clothed during other seasons, thus making them seasonal naturists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Casler | first1 = Lawrence | year = 1964 | title = Some sociopsychological observations in a nudist camp: A preliminary study | url = | journal = The Journal of social psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 307–323 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919569}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quiddity has caught the public perception and comprehension of public nudity, and thus it is frequently equated with summer destinations such as beaches.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, Storm.

== History ==
{{Main|History of nudity|l1=Nudity in History}}
{{see also|Timeline of non-sexual social nudity}}
Nudity in social contexts has been practised in various forms by many [[culture]]s at all time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/how-it-used-to-be/ |title=nudity as a social norm |publisher=active naturists |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western society nowadays, social nudity is most frequently encountered in the contexts of [[bathing]], swimming and in [[sauna]]s, whether in single-sex groups, within the family or with mixed-sex friends, but throughout history and in many tropical cultures until now, nudity is a norm at many sports events and competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activenaturists.net/nudity-ok2/ |title=naked sport events throughout history |publisher=active naturists |date=2012-08-30 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to nominate exactly when naturism started as a movement. The word 'naturism' was used for the first time in 1778 by a French-speaking Belgian, Jean Baptiste Luc Planchon (1734–1781), and was advocated as a means of improving the ''hygiène de vie'' or healthy living.{{efn|"Le naturisme est la doctrine qui consiste à laisser agir la nature plutot que d'intervenir de manière artificielle".&lt;ref name="Planchon"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Planchon|first=Jean Baptiste Luc |title=La naturisme, ou La nature considérée dans les maladies &amp; leur traitement conforme à la doctrine &amp; à la pratique d'Hippocrate et de ses sectateurs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3ZEAAAAcAAJ|year=1778|publisher=Varlé}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The earliest known naturist club in the "western" sense of the word was established in British [[India]] in 1891. The 'Fellowship of the Naked Trust' was founded by Charles Edward Gordon Crawford, a widower, who was a [[District Courts of India|District and Sessions Judge]] for the [[Bombay]] [[Indian Civil Service|Civil Service]]. The commune was based in [[Matheran]] and had just three members at the beginning; Crawford and two sons of an [[Anglican]] missionary, Andrew and Kellogg Calderwood.{{efn|Crawford wrote a series of letters discussing his new club and its philosophy to the socialist [[Edward Carpenter]] between 1891 and 1892. In his letters to Carpenter, Crawford described his daily activities.

: "Calderwood and I were up at Matheran having two days’ holiday to spend naked from breakfast to evening [...] in June, Calderwood and I had a grand day. We went away to a bungalow in the [[Tulsi Lake]] without servants and spent from dinner time Saturday till 5 pm Sunday in nature’s garb".

The club's dress code required full nudity, with exceptions made for accessories such as rings and glasses. Members of the club had to be plainspoken about sexual related matters and all [[taboo]]s were consciously discarded. Carpenter suggested that a female branch should be added to the commune, although this was not achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/cover-story/Worlds-first-nudist-colony-was-in-Thane-and-this-man-proved-it/articleshow/16011435.cms|title=World's first nudist colony was in Thane (and this man proved it)|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The commune fell apart when Crawford was transferred to [[Ratnagiri]]; he died soon after in 1894.{{sfn|Farrar|2005}}

[[File:Koch, Max (1854-1925) - 1897 - Freilicht - vmp 01.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Max Koch]]'s ''Freilicht'', 1897]]

In 1902, a series of philosophical papers was published in [[Germany]] by Dr. [[Heinrich Pudor]], under the pseudonym Heinrich Scham, who coined the term ''Nacktkultur''. In 1906 he went on to write a three volume treatise with his new term as its title, which discussed the benefits of nudity in co-education and advocated participating in sports while being free of cumbersome clothing.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}} [[Richard Ungewitter]] (''Nacktheit'', 1906, ''Nackt'', 1908, etc.) proposed that combining physical fitness, sunlight, and fresh air bathing, and then adding the nudist philosophy, contributed to mental and psychological fitness, good health, and an improved moral-life view.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}} Major promoters of these ideas included [[Adolf Koch]] and [[Hans Suren]]. Germany published the first journal of nudism between 1902 and 1932.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=}}

The wide publication of those papers and others, contributed to an explosive worldwide growth of nudism, in which nudists participated in various social, recreational, and physical fitness activities in the nude. The first organized club for nudists on a large scale, ''Freilichtpark'' (Free-Light Park), was opened near [[Hamburg]] in 1903 by Paul Zimmerman.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}}
In 1919, German doctor [[Kurt Huldschinsky]] discovered that exposure to sunlight helped to cure [[rickets]] in many children, causing sunlight to be associated with improved health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26935867 10 inventions that owe their success to World War One]&lt;/ref&gt;

In France in the early 20th century, the brothers [[Gaston Durville|Gaston]] and [[André Durville]], both of them physicians, studied the effects of psychology, nutrition, and environment on health and healing. They became convinced of the importance of natural foods and the natural environment on human well-being and health. They named this concept {{lang-fr|naturisme}}. The profound effect of clean air and sunlight on human bodies became evident to them and so nudity became a part of their naturism.

Naturism became a more widespread phenomenon in the 1920s, in [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and other European countries and spread to the [[United States]] where it became established in the 1930s.

By 1951, the national federations united to form the [[International Naturist Federation]] or [[International Naturist Federation|INF]].{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} Some naturists preferred not to join clubs, and after 1945, pressure was put to designate beaches for naturist use.
From the middle of the 20th century, with changing leisure patterns, commercial organisations began opening holiday resorts to attract naturists who expected the same&amp;nbsp;– or better&amp;nbsp;– standards of comfort and amenity offered to non-naturists.  More recently, naturist holiday options have expanded to include cruises.{{sfn|Buchy|2005}}

== Philosophy ==
[[File:Badstuga, efter illustration i Acerbis Travels, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|right|''Finnish Sauna'' (1802)]]
Naturism had many different philosophical sources and means many things to different people.&lt;ref name="Carter2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Michael|title=J.C. Flügel and the Nude Future|journal=Fashion Theory|volume=7|issue=1|year=2003|pages=79–101|issn=1362-704X|doi=10.2752/136270403778052203}}{{subscription|via=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no one definition. In 1974, the INF defined naturism as:

:: ''a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of social nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and for the environment.&lt;ref name="Definition" /&gt;

At one end of the spectrum are the nudists who just enjoy a nude life style, and at the other are the naturists, who have deeply held beliefs and see communal nudity as just one of many important principles.

The naturist philosophy has several sources, many of which can be traced back to early 20th century health and fitness philosophies in [[Germany]] and [[England]], although the concepts of returning to nature and creating equality have much deeper roots.

&lt;!-- moved from lead- needs integrating From Germany the idea spread to the rest of Europe and [[North America]] and beyond where a network of clubs developed. The model of [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|German naturism]]  is to promote naturist family and recreational sports, with the [[DFK|German Association for Free Body Culture (DFK)]] being a member of the [[German Olympic Sport Federation]] ([[DOSB]]). [[France|French]] naturism developed on the basis of large [[vacation (travel)|holiday]] complexes. This in turn influenced [[Quebec]] and the United States. A subsequent development was [[tourism|tourist]] naturism, where nudist resorts would be built to cater for the nudist tourist, without any local base. This concept is most noticeable in the [[Caribbean]]. Nevertheless, most naturist activity takes place at local naturist clubs, especially in Western countries. --&gt;

=== Gymnosophy and religious nakedness ===
{{see also|Gymnosophist|American Gymnosophical Association}}

In the 4th century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] encountered, in India, wandering groups of naked holy men whom he dubbed the ''naked philosophers''. (''Gr ''gymnos'': naked; ''sophist'': knowledge''). The philosopher [[Onesicritus]] investigated their beliefs and lifestyle. [[Pyrrho]] the [[Sceptic]] was impressed and incorporated nudity into his philosophy. The Gymnosophists were [[Hindu]]s, but [[Jain]] and [[Ajivika]] monks [[Nudity in religion|practiced nudity as a statement]] that they had given up all worldly goods. Nudity was not a new concept to the Greeks as the [[Olympic Games]] (founded in 776 BC) were exclusively male and nude events. 

Historically, the [[Adamites]], a [[Gnostic]] sect, practiced [[Nudity in religion|religious nudism]].
A religious sect in Canada that immigrated from Russia, the [[Sons of Freedom (political group)|Sons of Freedom]], went so far in the 1900s (1903-1950s) as to publicly strip in mass public demonstrations to protest against government policies which were meant to assimilate them.&lt;ref&gt;* Jim Hamm Productions Limited ''Spirit Wrestlers'', a 2002 documentary video and DVD about the Russian Christian sect called Freedomite Doukhobors,&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Christian naturism]] contains various members associated with most [[Christian denomination|denominations]].  Although beliefs vary, a common theme is that much of Christianity has misinterpreted the events regarding the [[Garden of Eden]], and God was displeased with [[Adam and Eve]] for covering their bodies with [[fig leaf|fig leaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.figleafforum.com/resources_genesis.html |title="What Do The First Three Chapters Of Genesis Teach About Clothing?" by Ian B. Johnson, Fig Leaf Forum (note: articles such as this one are peer reviewed) |publisher=Figleafforum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first English naturists adopted the name Gymnosophy as a thinly disguised euphemism for their pastime. The [[English Gymnosophical Society]] was formed in 1922 and became the [[New Gymnosophy Society]] in 1926; they purchased land at 'Bricketts Wood' to become Britain's first [[nudist colony]]. One of the first members was [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who in 1945 established the 'Five Acres Club' nearby, ostensibly as a nudist club, but as a front for [[Wicca]]ns, as [[witchcraft]] was illegal in England until 1951.

The [[Digambar]], one of the two main divisions of the [[Jainism|Jain]] religion of India, remain [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|skyclad]], or naked, though generally it is practiced by males.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Digambar means 'clothed with the sky'. [[Wicca]]ns have adopted this wording and some practice their rituals skyclad.

=== Naturist writers ===
* [[Elton Raymond Shaw]] was a [[Methodist]] churchman and publisher who wrote on the Body Taboo.
* [[Heinrich Pudor]] wrote on methods to improve social hygiene in his book ''Nackende Menschen und Jauchzen der Zukunft'' (Naked people and the future of Mankind) and then ''[[Nacktkultur]]'' (Nude Culture). It prescribes an austere lifestyle and nudity.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Paul Zimmermann|Paul Zimmermann]] opened the Freilicht Park in Lübeck which was open to those who subscribed to Nacktkultur principles.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[Richard Ungewitter]] wrote ''Die Nacktheit'' (Nakedness) which sold 90,000 copies, prescribed a similar Utopian lifestyle, where everyone would be nude, eat only vegetables and abstain from alcohol and tobacco. In his Utopia, everyone was to be Germanic with blue eyes and blonde hair.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Adolf Koch|Adolf Koch]], a left-wing primary-school teacher, sought to use social nudity to free the people from 'authority fixated conditioning which held proletarians in deference of their masters: parental authority, paternalism of the church, the mass media and organs of law and order. He used Organic-Rhythmic exercises in Berlin schools in the 1920s. In 1932 there were about 100,000 Germans involved with Naturism, of which 70,000 were in Koch's ''Körperschülen'' schools.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}
* [[:de:Hans Suren|Hans Surén]] taught nude gymnastics to soldiers for five years, and on being forced to leave the army, he wrote in 1924, ''Mensch und die Sonne'' (Men and the Sun) which ran to 61 reprints.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}} Later, in 1936, Surén proposed physical exercise and naturism as a means of creating a pure German race and of beauty. In the early 1940s he was out of favour and arrested. By 1945, he had turned full circle and was writing religious texts. Though never a member of any FKK club he was awarded honorary membership of the [[Deutscher Verband für Freikörperkultur|DFK]] in 1952.
* [[:de:Werner Zimmermann|Werner Zimmermann]] was Swiss. He promoted [[Progressive education]], encouraging naked [[Physical education]] to eliminate body guilt and to encourage openness that would lift the repression of the human spirit, which he saw as the cause of sexual deviation. The basic position was that the human body, in and of itself, was neither sinful nor obscene. This was adopted into the emerging philosophy that created the modern Western nudist movement.

[[File:Nude people at Praia do Abricó.jpg|right|thumb|Family in Praia do Abricó, [[Brazil]]]]

Individuals have formed naturist groups for a variety of specific purposes.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} It is generally agreed by naturist organisations that [[eroticism]] and blatant sexuality have no place in naturism and are, in fact, antithetical to its ideals. Reasons that have at times been given:

* [[ecology|Ecological]] or [[environmentalist|environmental]]&amp;nbsp;— rapport with the natural world.
* [[Health]]&amp;nbsp;— bathing in the sun, fresh air and water ([[balneotherapy]], [[thalassotherapy]], [[heliotherapy]]). Sun is a form of medicine.
* [[Healthy diet|Diet]]&amp;nbsp;— Naturism has at times been associated with claims made for moderation with [[alcohol]], [[meat]], [[tobacco]], [[drug]]s; leading to a [[teetotal]], [[vegetarian]] or [[vegan]] lifestyle.
* [[Nude psychotherapy|Psychologically]] — rapport with other humans including equality and respect. Being nude in groups makes all feel more accepted&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; physically, intellectually and emotionally.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;
* [[Spirituality]]&amp;nbsp;— nudity, well being and direct contact to nature helps feel closer to the universe.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* [[Pedagogy]]&amp;nbsp;— children should be respected as equals instead of being patronised{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* [[Social equality|Equality]]&amp;nbsp;— clothes build social barriers. Social nudity leads to acceptance in spite of differences in age, body shape, fitness, and health.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Discussed in:{{Citation | last = Veltheim| first = Andrew| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Naturism: Naked Beneath Your Clothing| year = | url = http://www.parama.com/html/naturism.html| accessdate =2012-04-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408070907/http://www.parama.com/html/body_naturism.html |archivedate=2010-04-08 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Liberty]]&amp;nbsp;— no one has the right to tell others or their children that they must wear clothes.

=== Naturism and the romantics ===
[[Walt Whitman]] American writer, A Sun-bathed Nakedness:

{{quote|Never before did I get so close to Nature; never before did she come so close to me... Nature was naked, and I was also... Sweet, sane, still Nakedness in Nature! - ah if poor, sick, prurient humanity in cities might really know you once more! Is not nakedness indecent? No, not inherently. It is your thought, your sophistication, your fear, your respectability, that is indecent. There come moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear, but are themselves indecent.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Citation|title=Nakedness and Nature|url=http://www.naturistplace.com/nudity19.htm|website=Naturist Place|date=8 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Henry David Thoreau]], ''In wildness is the preservation of the world.'', [[Walking (Thoreau)|Walking]]:

{{quote|We cannot adequately appreciate this aspect of nature if we approach it with any taint of human pretense. It will elude us if we allow artifacts like clothing to intervene between ourselves and this Other. To apprehend it, we cannot be naked enough.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;}}

Naturism was part of a literary movement in the late 1800s (see the writings of [[André Gide]]) which also influenced the art movements of the time specifically [[Henri Matisse]] and other [[Fauvism|Fauve]] painters. This movement was based on the French concept of ''[[joie de vivre]]'', the idea of reveling freely in physical sensations and direct experiences and a spontaneous approach to life.{{sfn|Harrison &amp; Perry|1993|p=}}

=== Naturism for health ===
[[Sunlight]] has been shown to be beneficial in some skin conditions and enables the body to make [[vitamin D]],&lt;ref name=bupa2004&gt;{{Citation| last =BUPA's Health Information Team| first =| author-link =| last2 =| first2 =| author2-link =| title =Hot topic – Vitamin D, sunlight and cancer| date =24 March 2004| url =http://www.bupa.co.uk/health_information/html/health_news/261103vitd.html| accessdate =2007-12-02| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070203050901/http://www.bupa.co.uk/health_information/html/health_news/261103vitd.html| archivedate =3 February 2007| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with the increased awareness of [[skin cancer]], wearing of [[sunscreen]] is now part of the culture.&lt;ref name=bupa2004/&gt; Sun exposure prompts the body to produce [[nitric oxide]] that helps support the cardiovascular system and the feelgood brain-chemical [[serotonin]].&lt;ref name="LindqvistEpstein2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindqvist|first1=P.

===World Naked Bike Ride===
[[File:Naked Bike Ride - Holborn - 12 June 2016.JPG|thumb|WNBR passing [[Holborn tube station|Holborn underground station]] 11 June 2016]]
The [[World Naked Bike Ride]] (WNBR) is an international [[clothing-optional bike ride]] and exercise in [[public nudity]], that has developed outside the organised naturism movement. Participants plan, meet and ride together ''en masse'' on [[human-powered transport]] (the vast majority on [[bicycle]]s, but some on [[skateboard]]s and [[inline skates]]), to "deliver a vision of a cleaner, safer, body-positive world."&lt;ref name="WNBRwebsite"&gt;[http://worldnakedbikeride.org Official WNBR global web site] circa June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The WNBR shares some aspects of the philosophy of naturism in that it promotes a return to healthy exercise in unpolluted air at the same time promoting positive body image.

== Demographics ==
* In 1999, the [[Federation of Canadian Naturists]] commissioned a national survey on Canadian attitudes towards nudity&lt;ref name=fcnstat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/survey-on-naturism-in-canada |title=1999 National Survey on Canadian Attitudes Towards Nudity |year=1999 |work=Federation of Canadian Naturists |publisher=Federation of Canadian Naturists |location=Ontario, Canada |accessdate=2011-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003072728/http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/survey-on-naturism-in-canada |archivedate=2011-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which found that 8.9% of Canadian have visited or would visit a naturist facility. A further 11.6% have gone or would go skinny dipping in mixed company; that 39% go naked in their own homes; that naturists tend to have above average incomes; that urban dwellers are more likely to be naturist than country dwellers; and that the under 25s are the most likely to be naturists.
* In 1983, the Naturist Society in the United States sponsored a Gallup poll, which was repeated in 2000,{{sfn|Anderson |2000}} which found the following:

&lt;!-- Needs to be rewritten and sourced.
=== Croatia ===
Croatia has been an attractive naturist destination for five decades. Today there are more than 30 official naturist campsites, tourist villages, hotels, apartments, beaches and numerous more unofficial naturist bathing places.
Naturism is well accepted all along Croatian Adriatic coast. There are official naturist beaches which are sometimes within all naturist resorts and campings and sometimes there are special areas in textile resorts assigned for naturists. Often entrance is charged.
Then there are so called free beaches which are known to be naturist for many years, but not officially. Those places are mostly clothing optional.
And finally there are wild beaches where one can freely choose to be bare or to keep swimming suit on.
Naturist beaches are marked with signs saying "FKK" for "Freikörperkultur," German for Free Body Culture. Unofficial beaches are sometimes called free beaches. Croatia's naturist facilities often focus on different visitor categories, including families, adults, gays, and those where everyone is welcome. Beaches also often are sectioned into these categories.
Many naturist beaches (official or not) are within walking distance from centers of towns, villages or resorts. Many of the regular beaches have also a naturist section, usually at the end of the beach.
Croatia has long been popular for bare-all beach holidays, especially with German and Dutch nudists. Koversada, an island linked by bridge to the Istrian mainland, is the oldest among 30 official naturist resorts. All are indicated by "FKK" signs but there are also scores of unofficial strips.{{cn|date=November 2013}} --&gt;{{main|List of social nudity places in Europe}}

=== Finland ===
In [[Finnish culture]], nudism is considered to be a relatively normal way to live. It is not uncommon to see entire families spending time together naked. Families may be naked while bathing in a sauna, swimming in a pool, or playing on a beach, and it's not unusual to see children playing naked in a kindergarten or family yard for example. Nudity as a whole is considered less taboo than many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Mapes, Terri. [http://goscandinavia.about.com/od/finland/qt/nudism_finland.htm "Nudism in Finland"]. ''about travel''.

{{main|Naturism in France}}

In 1903 la ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]'' published a report on [[Freikörperkultur|German naturism]] and S. Gay created a naturist community at Bois-Fourgon. In 1907, supported by his superiors, Abbé Legrée encouraged the students at his Catholic college to bathe nude on the rocky beaches near [[Marseille]].

[[File:CapdAgde crop.jpg|thumb|right|Sign at [[Cap d'Agde]] mentioning that it is obligatory to be nude at this beach]]

Marcel Kienné de Mongeot is credited with starting naturism in France in 1920. His family had suffered from tuberculosis, and he saw naturism as a cure and a continuation of the traditions of the ancient Greeks. In 1926, he started the magazine ''Vivre intégralement'' (later called ''Vivre'') and the first French naturist club, ''Sparta Club'' at Garambouville, near [[Evreux]].  The court action that he initiated, established that nudism was legal on private property that was fenced and screened.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

[[File:Nude hiking in Gard.jpg|thumb|left|Randonue in [[Les Concluses]], [[Gard]], 2008]]

Drs. André and Gaston Durville bought a 70 hectare site on the [[Île du Levant]] where they established the village of [[Île du Levant|Héliopolis]]. The village was open to the public. In 1925 Dr François Fougerat de David de Lastours wrote a thesis on [[heliotherapy]]. and in that year opened the ''Club gymnique de France''.  In 1936, the naturist movement was officially recognised.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

Albert and Christine Lecocq were active members of many of these clubs, but after disagreements left and In 1944 Albert and Christine Lecocq founded the ''Club du Soleil'' with members in 84 cities. In 1948 they founded the [[:fr:Féderation Française de Naturisme|FFN]], in 1949 they started the magazine, ''Vie au Soleil'' and in 1950 opened the [[CHM Montalivet]], the world's first naturist holiday centre where the [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] was formed.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

The naturist village [[Leucate]] and [[Cap d'Agde]] offers a different form of social nudity. [[Euronat (naturist resort)|Euronat]] is the largest holiday centre (335ha) situated 10&amp;nbsp;km north of Montalivet. Naturism employs more than 3000 people, and is estimated to be worth 250 million Euro to the French economy.&lt;!-- ref needed --&gt; France is represented on the [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] by the [[:fr:Féderation Française de Naturisme|FFN]].

{{See also|Freikörperkultur}}
German naturism was part of the [[Lebensreform]] movement and the [[Wandervogel]] youth movement of 1896, from [[Steglitz]], [[Berlin]] which promoted ideas of fitness and vigour. At the same time doctors of the [[:de:Naturheilbewegung|Natural Healing Movement]] were using [[heliotherapy]], treating diseases such as [[Tuberculosis|TB]], [[rheumatism]] and [[scrofula]] with exposure to sunlight.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}

[[File:Naked woman in inner city 3.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[nude]] woman moves in a busy market in Germany, while other people carry on with their routine activities, 2005.]]

Nacktkultur, a term coined in 1903 by [[Heinrich Pudor]], flourished.{{sfn|Toepfer|1997|p=}}  Nacktkultur connected nudity, vegetarianism and social reform. It was practised in a network of 200 members clubs. The movement gained prominence in the 1920s as offering a health giving life-style with Utopian ideals. Germany published the first naturist journal between 1902 and 1932.{{sfn|Kennedy|2013|p=}}
It became politicised by radical socialists who believed it would lead to classlessness and a breaking down of society. It became associated with [[pacificism]].{{sfn|Hau|2003|p=}}

In 1926, [[Adolf Koch]] established a school of naturism in Berlin; encouraging a mixing of the sexes, open air exercises, and a programme of "sexual hygiene". In 1929, the Berlin school hosted the first International Congress on Nudity.{{sfn|Toepfer|1997|p=}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-0905-402, Ostsee, Sonnenbad.jpg|thumb|left|Young East German women at a naturist beach in 1988]]

During the [[Nazism|National Socialist]] ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' era, all naturist clubs had to register with the ''Reichsbund für Leibesübungen'', which meant excluding [[Judaism|Jews]] and [[Communism|Communists]]. Also, they had to keep all activities hidden in the countryside where there was little chance of being seen by others. The status as a West German ''sports federation'' member gave the clubs rights and privileges (e.g. tax exemptions) so the naturist clubs remained in the federation after the war had ended.

After the war, [[East Germany|East Germans]] were free to practice naturism, chiefly at beaches rather than clubs (private organizations being regarded as potentially subversive). Naturism became a large element in DDR politics. The ''Proletarische Freikörperkulturbewegung'' subsection of the Workers Sports Organisation had 60,000 members.{{sfn|Anderson |2000}}

=== Poland ===
First reported naturist society was established in 1897 in [[Grudziądz]]. In pre-war and post-war [[Poland]], naturism was practised in closed and secluded areas. Reported places for naturism were [[Zaleszczyki]] (in today's [[Ukraine]]) and [[Otwock]]. Under the [[communist|communism]] regime, Poland's naturism became unofficial and was practiced mostly by the artistic boheme near [[Krynica Morska]], [[Misdroy]] and Dębki.

In the early 1980s naturism became popular mostly due to increased interest in [[News media|media]]. As the [[pop music|pop]] song "Chałupy Welcome To" (about the naturist beach in Chałupy, featuring beach nudity in the clip) became the 1985 [[summer hit]] in Poland, the nude seaside locations like [[Chałupy]] or [[Rowy, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Rowy]] became known to an average Polish sunbather. Polish Naturist Society was formed and after the number of [[lawsuit]]s, naturism became tolerated in selected "unofficial" beaches and distant spots.

Naturism in Portugal had its first historical record around 1920, linked to the Portuguese Naturist Society, of which the anarcho-syndicalist José Peralta was a prominent member. Nudity was already being practiced on [[Costa da Caparica]] beaches. With the beginning of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|New State]] authoritarian regime in the 1930s, the naturist movement was limited to vegetarian and alternative medicines, since nudity was banned and associated to the crime of "indecency". Only after the end of the New State regime in 1974 (April, 25th) the activities linked to the practice of nudity were resumed.

The ''Federação Portuguesa de Naturismo'' (Portuguese Naturist Federation) or FPN was founded on the March 1st, 1977, at a meeting in Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpn.pt/sobre_nos/quem_somos_en.php|title=Home &gt; About Us &gt; Who We Are|publisher=Portuguese Naturist Federation|accessdate=2 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203081647/http://www.fpn.pt/sobre_nos/quem_somos_en.php|archivedate=3 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the present, there are seven official naturist beaches in Portugal. Besides these, there are several dozens of beaches were the practice of naturism is common. There are also several naturist campings and resorts.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Slovenia ===
Beginnings of naturism in Slovenia started in the year 1852, when a 29 year old Swiss physician [[Arnold Rikli]] visited [[Bled]] for the first time. In the following years he started to promote healthy way of living, because he considered water, air and light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zupanic-Slavec|first1=Z|last2=Toplak|first2=C|title=Water, air and light--Arnold Rikli (1823-1906)|journal=Gesnerus|date=1998|volume=55|issue=1–2|pages=58–69|pmid=9684537|doi=10.5169/seals-520867}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be the source for his healing therapy. He continued to build [[spa]] centers which included [[light therapy]] and [[hydrotherapy]] treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resonantfm.com/a-very-brief-history-of-red-light/|title=A Very Brief History of Red Light|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first visitors were most likely [[pilgrim]]s from Slovenia and [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] region who visited the church on Bled island. When the word has spread across Europe, other visitors started visiting Bled known for Rikli's healing therapy. A method used in the healing therapy process included [[sunbathing]] and visitors were often seen walking nude in public. Rikli continued to promote his healing tourism for the next 52 years, when he lived in Bled.

=== Spain ===
[[File:Nudist-Textile couple in Cabo de Gata, Spain.jpg|thumb|Nudist man and textile woman on a beach in Spain.]]
Public nudity in Spain is not illegal since there is no law banning its practice. Spanish legislation foresees felony for exhibitionism but restricts its scope to obscene exposure in front of children or mentally impaired individuals, i.e. with sexual connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1995-25444&amp;tn=1&amp;p=20150428#a185|title=BOE.es - Documento consolidado BOE-A-1995-25444|website=www.boe.es|language=es|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, people do not normally use this right to be naked to do it anywhere, and most usually perform this activity in places where nudism is a tradition.

There are however some municipalities (like [[San Pedro del Pinatar, Spain|San Pedro del Pinatar]]) where public nudity has been regulated (banned) by means of [[By-law|by-laws]]. Other municipalities (like [[Barcelona]], [[Salou]], [[Platja de Palma]] and [[Sant Antoni de Portmany]]) have also used these provisions to regulate the practice of semi-nudism, forcing people to cover their torso on the streets. Some naturist associations have appealed these by-laws on the grounds that a fundamental right ([[freedom of expression]], as they understand that nudism is a way of self-expression) cannot be regulated with this mechanism. Some judicial instances have ruled in favour of nudist associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.europapress.es/catalunya/noticia-federacion-espanola-naturismo-recurre-tsjc-prohibicion-nudismo-barcelona-20110717185055.html|title=La Federación Española de Naturismo recurre ante el TSJC la prohibición del nudismo en Barcelona|last=Press|first=Europa|date=2011-07-17|work=europapress.es|access-date=2017-12-03|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elconfidencialdigital.com/la_buena_vida/tendencias/localidades-multan-vas-camiseta-calle_0_2300169989.html|title=Cuatro localidades donde te multan si vas sin camiseta por la calle|work=El Confidencial Digital|access-date=2017-12-03|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudism in Spain is normally practised by the seaside, on beaches or small coves with a tradition on naturism. In [[Vera, Spain|Vera]] ([[Andalusia]]), there is a wide residential area formed by nudist urbanisations that constitute some kind of nudist town. Nudist organisations may organise some activities elsewhere in inner territory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naturismo.org/adn/calendario.html|title=Calendario actividades 2017. ADN: Asociación para el Desarrollo del Naturismo de la Comunidad de Madrid|website=www.naturismo.org|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (like hiking on the mountains close to Madrid), but these kind of activities are negligible. Madrid municipality enables nudist use of some of their public swimming pools one day during summer.

Textile use of traditionally nudist public spaces (like beaches or streets nearby) is allowed, mainly due to lack of regulation. Mixed groups of nudist and textile individuals are frequent in these kind of spaces. In order to chase voyeuristic persons away, nudist people will normally clap their hands.

Legal aspects regarding topless are analogue to those regarding nudism, but social tolerance towards topless is higher. This let people not cover their breasts in public swimming pools and on any beach in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20170811/43474195994/espanolas-topless.html|title=Las españolas son las que más topless y nudismo hacen|work=La Vanguardia|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the first official nudist club was established in [[Wickford]], [[Essex]] in 1924. According to Michael Farrar, writing for [[British Naturism]] the club adopted the name "Moonella Group" from the name of the owner of the ground, ''Moonella'', and called its site [[The Camp (Naturism)|The Camp]]. Moonella, who was still living in 1965 but whose identity remains to be discovered, had inherited a house with land in 1923 and made it available to certain members of the [[New Gymnosophy Society]]. This society had been founded a few years before by H.C. Booth, M.H. Sorensen and Rex Wellbye under the name of the [[English Gymnosophical Society]]. It met for discussions at the Minerva Cafe at 144 [[High Holborn]] in London, the headquarters of the [[Women's Freedom League]]. Those who were permitted to join the Moonella Group were carefully selected, and the club was run by an "aristocracy" of the original members, all of whom had "club names" to preserve their anonymity. The club closed in 1926 because of building on adjacent land.&lt;ref name=bntimeline&gt;{{Citation|last=Farrar |first=Michael |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=The history of naturism – a timeline |date= |year=2007 |url=http://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=50 |accessdate=2008-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019033149/https://british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=50 |archivedate=2010-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bnmoonella&gt;{{Citation|last=Farrar |first=Michael |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=The Moonella Group |date= |year=2007 |url=http://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=42 |accessdate=2008-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205201517/https://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=42 |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}

&lt;!-- [[File:WNBR Brighton 2014 04.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[World Naked Bike Ride]] in Brighton, 2014]]-- better image now used--&gt;
By 1943 there were a number of these so-called "sun clubs" and together they formed the [[British Sun Bathers Association]] or BSBA. In 1954 a group of clubs unhappy with the way the BSBA was being run split off to form the Federation of British Sun Clubs or FBSC. In 1961, the BSBA Annual Conference agreed that the term nudist was inappropriate and should be discarded in favour of naturist.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt; The two organisations rivalled each other before eventually coming together again in 1964 as the [[British Naturism|Central Council for British Naturism]] or [[British Naturism|CCBN]]. This organisation structure has remained much the same but it is now called [[British Naturism]] which is often abbreviated to BN.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt; BN is currently a [[company limited by guarantee]].

The first official nude beach was opened at [[Fairlight Glen]] in Covehurst Bay near [[Hastings]] in 1978 (not to be confused with [[Fairlight Cove]], which is 2&amp;nbsp;km to the east) followed later by the beaches at [[Brighton]] and [[Fraisthorpe]]. [[Bridlington]] opened in April 1980.&lt;ref name=bntimeline/&gt;

== In North America ==

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], individuals around the country became interested in nudism, skinny-dipping, and physical culture in the early part of the 20th century. After 1940 they had their own Canadian magazine, ''Sunbathing &amp; Health'', which occasionally carried local news. Canadians had scattered groups in several cities during the 1930s and 1940s, and some of these groups attracted enough interest to form clubs on private land.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} The most significant clubs were the Van Tan Club, formed in 1939, and continues today in North Vancouver, BC.,{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} and, in Ontario, the Sun Air Club.

Canadians who served in the military during the Second World War met like-minded souls from across the country, and often visited clubs while in Europe. They were a ready pool of recruits for post-war organizers. A few years later, the wave of post-war immigration brought many Europeans with their own extensive experience, and they not only swelled the ranks of membership, but often formed their own clubs, helping to expand nudism from coast to coast.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

Most of those clubs united in the Canadian Sunbathing Association, which affiliated with the American Sunbathing Association in 1954. Several disagreements between eastern and western members of the CSA resulted in the breakup of CSA into the Western Canadian Sunbathing Association (WCSA) and the Eastern Canadian Sunbathing Association (ECSA) in 1960. The ECSA endured much in-fighting over the next decade and a half, leading to its official demise in 1978. The WCSA continues today as the American Association for Nude Recreation&amp;nbsp;– Western Canadian Region (www.aanr-wc.com), a region of the [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) which itself was formerly known as the ASA.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

In 1977 the [[La Fédération Québécoise de Naturisme|Fédération québécoise de naturisme]] (FQN) was founded in Quebec, by Michel Vaïs, who had experienced European naturism at Montalivet. In 1985 the [[Federation of Canadian Naturists]] (FCN) was formed with the support of the FQN. In 1988 the FQN and FCN formed the [[FQN-FCN Union]] as the official Canadian representative in the [[International Naturist Federation]] (INF).{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

In 1925, Katherine and Herman Shoshinki were familiar with nudism from Germany from 1918 to 1923. Kurt Barthel founded the [[American League for Physical Culture]] in 1929 and organized the first nudist event. In about 1930 they organized the [[American Gymnosophical Association]]. Barthel founded America's first official [[nudist]] camp, Sky Farm in [[New Jersey]], in May, 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Ellensburg Daily Record, Aug 2, 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1932, AGA established the [[Rock Lodge Club]] as a nudist facility in [[Stockholm, New Jersey]] and [[Ilsley Boone]], a [[Dutch Reformed]] minister, formed the [[Christian naturism]] movement. Naturism began expanding nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clothesfree.com/history.html |title=The History of Social Nudism – Nudist History |publisher=Clothesfree.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/a-brief-history-of-naturism-nudism History of Naturism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002734/http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/a-brief-history-of-naturism-nudism |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lupinlodge.org/history.html |title=Body Acceptance: A Brief History of Social Nudity |publisher=Lupinlodge.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019234814/http://www.lupinlodge.org/history.html |archivedate=2012-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nef.oshkosh.net/Toni_Egbert_Library/US_District_Courts/Roberts_v__Clement/roberts_v__clement.html |title=Roberts v.

The [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) is the national naturist organization. [[Arnd Krüger]] compared nudists in Germany and the United States and came to the conclusion that in Germany the racial aspects (''Zuchtwahl'') were important for the breakthrough (e.g. the Commanding General of the Army served as patron for nudists events), while in the U.S. nudism was far more commercial and had thus more difficulties.{{sfn|Krüger|1992|p=343}} The AANR withdrew from the INF in 2010.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{clarify|date=September 2015}}&lt;!-- what's this mean to U.S. nudism? --&gt;

In 2008, a young adults group organized as Florida Young Naturists&lt;ref name="Florida Young Naturists FYN"/&gt; held their first Naked Bash which has since been repeated 3-4 times a year, growing into one of the largest young naturist gatherings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/music/top-10-reasons-to-get-totally-nude-at-the-florida-young-naturists-naked-spring-bash-nsfw-6424673|title=Top 10 Reasons to Get Totally Nude at the Florida Young Naturists' Naked Spring Bash|last=|first=|date=|website=New Times Broward-Palm Beach|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a campaign to promote Nudism in the United States occurred with an effort by AANR to record the largest simultaneous Skinny Dip at several U.S. Clubs and beaches, occurring on July 11 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wreckbeach.org/archive/AANRWorldRecordSkinnyDipFinal.pdf|title=The AANR World Record Skinny-Dip|last=|first=|date=|website=Wreck beach|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, an organization called Unconstitutional Arkansas was created to highlight the unconstitutionality of laws that prohibit or impede nudism.

== In Asia ==

Generally, public nudity in Asia is not tolerated. However, some traditional, religious or cultural nudity has survived the introduction of Western moral values against nudity, such as the Jain Digambara monks in India, hot springs in Taiwan and Japan, and some traditional tribes in Papua. Nudism and naked recreation is slowly developing in some countries, mainly Indonesia (Bali) and Thailand. Nudists meet on the internet (e.g. Bareskinasia.com) and organize activities in remote or private locations. Several nudists also have their own blogs.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Indonesia ===
In the seventies, nudity on [[Bali]]'s remote and deserted beaches was common but with the massive growth of tourism, this practice has disappeared. In 2002, nudity was declared illegal on Petitenget Beach, the last beach in [[Seminyak]] that tolerated discreet nudity. Individuals began to practice nudity in private villas and resorts. Laki Uma Villa, the first naturist facility to open, was for gay men only. Bali au Naturel, the first adult-only nudist resort for both genders, opened its doors in 2004. It subsequently expanded from 3 to 15 rooms and added from two more swimming pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unseen Bali|url=http://www.unseenbali.org|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nepal ===
Nudism is considered [[taboo]] in [[Nepal]]. Although there are no laws governing nudism, people may be detained, arrested and fined for public nudity. Nevertheless, many [[Hindu]] male sages practice nudism and they are not legally detained. Nudist sages can be seen in [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Thailand ===
Nudism was successfully introduced 10 years ago in [[Pattaya]] (Chan Resort), and six more nudist resorts have been created all over [[Thailand]]. Barefeet Resort in Bangkok, Lemon Tree in Phuket, Oriental Village in Chiangmai, Phuan Naturist Village in Huay Yai, and Family Naturist Camp in Petchaburi all belong to the Naturist Association of Thailand as well as other international naturist organizations. A gay hotel and sauna (Sansuk Hotel) located in Pattaya now also authorizes nudity in and around the swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.199.190.19/~sgt/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=27690 Nudity and naturism in Pattaya] Sawatdee Gay Thailand {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206045956/http://66.199.190.19/~sgt/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=27690 |date=2014-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues in social nudity ==
{{main|Issues in social nudity}}
[[File:Naturism.jpg|thumb|A naturist  &lt;nowiki&gt;''au naturel''&lt;/nowiki&gt; ]]
Naturism addresses, challenges and explores a myriad of sometimes [[taboo]] subjects: stereotypes and mores relating to the nude appearance of the human body, mixed [[sex]] nudity, [[personal space]], [[human sexuality]], [[gymnophobia]], [[modesty]], [[physical attractiveness]], [[vanity]], [[objectification]],  exploitation and [[consent]]. It can thus be controversial. Descamps assembled a list of criticisms of naturism: it is too cold; normal bodies look ugly—it is only for the physically beautiful; it is too embarrassing; it is against the laws of nature, against the law, or against religion; "[[nudity and sexuality|nudism makes me think of sex]]"; it is for primitive people or animals.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}

Naturism can sometimes contain aspects of eroticism, although the debate about this is often simplified and seen negatively in the media and the public mind and by many modern naturists and naturist organisations. Historically the experience and discussion of erotic feelings during naturist activities such as dance and gymnastics played an important part in early Germanic naturism and formed part of its 'positive' connection with nature. However, it was when naturism arrived in the more sexually conservative cultures of the UK and the United States that the expression and discussion of eroticism within naturism became frowned upon.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

Smith states {{quote|the main reason younger people are not becoming naturists is the inability of modern naturism to engage with the issue of sexuality. While it is true that "naturism became popular in Germany...as a healthy outdoor lifestyle", this lifestyle also included a recognition that, socially, nudity could sometimes be erotic. It was only when naturism arrived in a more sexually conservative Britain that sexual feelings were censored out to make naturism culturally acceptable.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}  }}  This statement is in response to the quote "The world of naturism is in trouble. Membership is falling, and fewer young people than ever are getting involved. Has the great nude adventure run its course? "{{sfn|Barkham|2007}}

Smith and King pose the [[Issues in social nudity#Sexual wellbeing|further points]] in their 2009 peer reviewed paper ''Naturism and Sexuality:broadening our approach to sexual wellbeing ''{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

=== Issues for the naturist community ===
Many countries and states have laws which adversely affect naturists. Oftentimes, these laws are intended to address "indecent exposure", but are so broadly written that they criminalize ordinary, non-sexual nudity. Some laws, however, specifically target naturism. For example, in [[Arkansas]] in the United States, not only is nudism illegal (even on private property), it is a crime to "promote" or "advocate" (i.e. express a favourable opinion about) nudism.&lt;ref name="UnconstitutionalArkansas.org"/&gt;

Any social group is said to go through four phases:
[[Forming-storming-norming-performing|forming, storming, norming, performing]], wrote [[Bruce Tuckman]] in 1965. In this context one can understand some of the current pressures on various aspects of naturism:

* Naturist club isolation: established clubs excluding new members and rejecting new ideas.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}
* A family movement in a time of social change: a change in needs and expectations, away from one of a permanent commitment towards one of change and choice.
* Multi-gen preferences: each generation is a specific social group which needs to have its own norms that are consistent with common rules.
* Clubs vs. holiday centres: organizations with different roots find it difficult to establish common rules. The contention between those espousing a year-round commitment to an ideal, and those who see it as summer-only recreation. Club naturism is declining, while the number of people that assume naturist facilities will be available at any holiday resort is rising. The number of users of free beaches may exceed the number of people who wish to join a club.&lt;!-- Please add a statistic --&gt;
* Paid staff and volunteers: many clubs were established as cooperatives, but the values change when a few members put in the capital or work needed.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} This became more difficult when some members were paid to act as site managers.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}}
* Infiltration by other groups: for many years clubs had strict "No singles" policies to maintain the family nature of the club.{{sfn|Descamps|1987|p=}} Many other social groups practice non-family nudism, whether it be social singles, [[Homosexuality|gay]] naturists or [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers]].
* [[Exhibitionism|Exhibitionists]] and [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]]: as unwelcome in a naturist community as in a clothed community.&lt;ref name="CCBN172"&gt;{{Citation  | last =Boura  | first =Malcolm    | title = Campaigning  | journal =British Naturism  | volume =BN 172  | issue =  | page = 31  | date =Summer 2007  | url =  | doi =  | id =  | issn = 0264-0406}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Risk of being filmed in nude without permission, such as at nude beach. Such photos and videos can then be put on internet.
* Sunburn and skin cancer.
*Large numbers of clothed people visit clothing optional and nudist beaches and make the naturists feel uncomfortable, "like they've become a spectacle".&lt;ref name="abc2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Broome nudists in battle for beach as naturism declines | last = Parke | first = Erin | work = ABC News | date = 24 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-24/is-public-nudity-on-the-wane-in-australia/7653938 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc._Getn"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Get naked or take a hike, angry nudists tell 'lookie-loos' | author =  | work = CBC News | date = 21 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/nudists-canada-overexposure-turf-war-1.3689094 | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thes_Hanl"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Hanlan’s Point nudists want beach-goers to bare all | last = Botelho-Urbanski | first = Jessica | work = Toronto Star | date = 20 July 2016 | accessdate = 2016-07-24 | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/07/20/hanlans-point-nudists-want-beach-goers-to-bare-all.html | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magazines ===
Magazines published by, for or purportedly about naturists can be grouped:

* Magazines published by an "official" national organisation, such as ''BN'' ([[British Naturism]]), ''Going Natural/Au naturel'' ([[Federation of Canadian Naturists|FCN/FQN]]), ''Nude &amp; Natural Magazine'' [[The Naturist Society|TNS]], ''gonatural'' (New Zealand Naturist Federation).
* Independent magazines published for naturists, such as ''Naturally'', ''[[H&amp;E naturist]]'' and ''TAN'' (acronym of ''The Australian Naturist'').
* Magazines that print photographs only or primarily of young female professional models, which are disapproved of by many naturists and non-naturists alike.

Magazines in the second and, occasionally, third grouping feature naturist editorial and advertising, while some naturists argue over which magazines belonged in which of these categories&amp;nbsp;– these views may change as publishers and editors change. Many clubs and groups have benefitted from magazines which, while not exclusively or even predominantly naturist in character, made naturist information available to many who would not otherwise have been aware of it.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}  (These days, the information and advertising provided online, and the wide availability of free online porn, has meant the disappearance of old-style 'skin' magazines presenting significant glamour content masquerading as or alongside naturist content.  Naturist magazines have to appeal strongly to naturists to succeed&amp;nbsp;– they cannot sit on the fence between naturism and glamour.)
Some naturists still feel that the worthwhile editorial content in some magazines is not a fair balance for the disapproved-of photographic content.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}

=== Photography, films and videos ===
Some naturist clubs have been willing to allow filming by the media on their grounds, though content that proved not to be of genuine naturism can end up being parodied by the media as the norm.&lt;ref name=telegraph &gt;{{Citation | last = Edwards| first = Adam| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =  Stark naked ambition| date = 10 May 2006 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/05/10/ftnude10.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2006/05/10/ixartright.html | accessdate = 2007-12-02 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | publisher = [[Sunday Telegraph]]}} gives a history of naturism, written in a personal style that attempts to use this type of humour.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commercial 'naturist' DVDs are dominated by imagery of naked children.  Such material can be marketed in ways that appear to appeal directly to paedophile inclinations, and ownership of these DVDs (and their earlier video cassette incarnations) has resulted in successful British prosecutions for possession of indecent images of children.&lt;ref name=crowther1&gt;{{Citation | title = Gay reverend fined over 'indecent' images of boys | url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/gay-reverend-fined-over-indecent-images-of-boys-26300917.html | accessdate = 3 April 2014 | work = Irish Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crowther2&gt;{{Citation|title=Rector found guilty over indecent images |date=29 June 2007 |url=http://www.4ie.ie/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=63004 |accessdate=4 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304193047/http://www.4ie.ie/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=63004 |archivedate= 4 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ocarroll1&gt;{{Citation | title = Paedophile campaigner walks free | work = BBC News online | date = 26 November 2002 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2516383.stm | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One case was appealed, unsuccessfully, to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=ocarroll2&gt;{{Citation | title = O'Carroll vs the United Kingdom | date = 15 May 2005 | url=http://echr.ketse.com/doc/35557.03-en-20050315/view/ | accessdate = 3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precedents set by the court cases mean that possession in Britain of any naturist image of a child is, potentially, grounds for prosecution.

Photo shoots, including major high-profile works by [[Spencer Tunick]], are done on public places including beaches.{{efn|Photography in public nude beaches

Nudists who visit public nude beaches may be photographed by [[street photography|street photographers]], [[social documentary photography|social documentary photographers]], [[photojournalism|photojournalists]] or other kinds of photographers without the nudists' knowledge and in the United States and most democratic countries the photographers have the law on their side as no individual has an [[expectation of privacy]] in a [[public place]] and photographers are not required to have the naturists' consent before photographing them or publishing and selling the pictures or videos.{{sfn|NJ|2011}} In many countries there exist private nudist areas in which photography is not allowed and naturists who wish to not be photographed can enjoy their activities there. However, naturists who wish to not be photographed in public nude beaches have found various ways to make the photographers leave the beach, such as photographing the photographer and publishing such photos.

Some nude beaches provide fences that block the view from nearby streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g147317-d155079-i25617439-Club_Ambiance-Runaway_Bay_Saint_Ann_Parish_Jamaica.html Trip Advisor]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- This paragraph needs to be developed expanded and floated as a separate page --&gt;
&lt;!-- Needs ref and maybe a naturist magazines list page --&gt;
&lt;!-- ==Terminology==
* ''Clothist'' is a term describing someone who does not practice social nudity.-- Is there a reference for this term?-- Never heard it used in Europe. Supported by Korky Day
* ''[[Gymnophobia]]'' is an irrational fear or anxiety about being seen naked, or about seeing others naked.

=== Humour ===
* A ''cottontail'' is a term describing someone whose [[buttocks]] are paler than his or her legs and back, caused by [[sun tanning]] while wearing a swimsuit. (US specific)
* In uniform, ie nude.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}
* A ''[[acomoclitism|shaved]]'' individual or ''smoothie'' is one who shaves off much of his/her body hair, including the pubic hair. This is so common now- does the word still exist? It sounds derogatory
* ''[[Topfree]]'' means bare-chested (leaving chest and breasts uncovered), or a place that allows uncovered female and male chests. The term was coined by activists to use instead of the term "topless", which has a negative connotation to some, in part because it is used by strip clubs. Naturist women felt they'd rather be "free" than "less". Topless is also used. Is this not a historical term that is no longer current? --&gt;
&lt;!-- Recent research has begun to explore this complex and historical relationship while highlighting how erotic experiences within naturism may actually enhance sexual wellbeing and be a positive force within naturism.&lt;ref name=smithking/&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- {{POV-statement|date=November 2008}} Summary of chapter 1, of Descamps which is referenced above-- this subsection is about opinions- please suggest  better wording on the talk page --&gt;
&lt;!-- See talk page for discussion of Nikki Craft- and her display of disturbing links --&gt;
&lt;!-- Those inexperienced in social nudity often say that they fear that it contributes to an imbalance of power between men and women. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} They say that women and children are more vulnerable when nude, and can be exploited.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} While that might be true in a situation of commercial nudity, such as a strip club, women advocates of social nudity assert the opposite, especially in an established nude group. The men are nude there as well, no money is changing hands, nor is anyone in any sense giving a "performance". No one pays to be nude and no one is being paid to be nude. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  Padding --&gt;
&lt;!-- Move to new page: * [[Arkansas]], which calls itself "The Natural State" on its licence plates, has made it illegal for people to advocate nudism under code 5-68-204 section C which states:
: "''It is unlawful for any:
: ''(1)  Person, club, camp, corporation, partnership, association, or organization to advocate, demonstrate, or promote nudism; or  ''
: ''(2)  Person to rent, lease, or otherwise permit his or her land, premises, or buildings to be used for the purpose of advocating, demonstrating, or promoting nudism.''" its none too easy to do in Saudi Arabia either --&gt;
&lt;!-- Some people believe that the naked human body is to be accepted, respected, cherished, and enjoyed. They believe it is not inherently shameful, corrupting, degrading, or dangerous. Many of them enjoy clothes free activities. They reject views that being naked with other people is morally wrong ([[indecent exposure|indecent]]), [[sexual]] ''per se'' ([[erotic]] or [[pornographic]]). They argue that nakedness is a healthy, [[nature|natural]] state, that being nude is to be in the purest form, since everyone was [[birth|born]] nude. They generally find that they quickly become so accustomed to being nude among nudes that it no longer seems very remarkable. It is, rather, simply one part of their [[lifestyle]].
 --&gt;
&lt;!-- Practitioners say that they are not pruriently interested in seeing others naked (which, if for sexual pleasure, is called [[voyeurism]]) or in being seen naked by others (likewise: [[exhibitionism]]). --&gt;

'''Necrofauna''' are species that were previously [[extinct]] and have been biologically revived or recreated by the process of [[de-extinction]].

Necrofauna are proxies or imitations of their former species and not identical replicas. Due to a number of technological, biological and environmental factors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/science/revive-restore-extinct-species-dna-mammoth-passenger-pigeon.html|title=We Might Soon Resurrect Extinct Species. Is It Worth the Cost?|last=Yin|first=Steph|date=2017-03-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are considered a new type organism altogether. [[De-extinction|Revive and Restore]], a nonprofit organization that supports pursuing de-extinction research with transparency to the public, describes the creation of necrofauna as a result of “transfer[ing] the [[gene]]s that define the extinct species into the [[genome]] of the related species, effectively converting it into a living version of the extinct creature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reviverestore.org/what-we-do/genetic-rescue/|title=What is Genetic Rescue? – Revive &amp; Restore|date=2013-09-27|work=Revive &amp; Restore|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the existence of necrofauna is still largely [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]], a [[Pyrenean ibex]] was the first and only animal to have undergone the de-extinction process with moderate success.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090210-bucardo-clone_2.html|title=First Extinct-Animal Clone Created|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "unextinct" or revived animal was born, but then died several minutes later due to a lung defect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piña-Aguilar|first=Raul E.|last2=Lopez-Saucedo|first2=Janet|last3=Sheffield|first3=Richard|last4=Ruiz-Galaz|first4=Lilia I.|last5=de J.

Necrofauna and the de-extinction movement are highly [[Controversy|controversial]] within [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and scientific circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minteer|first=Ben|date=2014-05-15|title=Is it right to reverse extinction?|url=https://www.nature.com/news/is-it-right-to-reverse-extinction-1.15212|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=509|issue=7500|pages=261–261|doi=10.1038/509261a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many conservationists argue that creating necrofauna could potentially distract from the urgency of saving [[endangered species]] that are still alive. Concerns have also been raised pertaining to the possible damaging impacts [[ecology]] could face in the wake of introducing a new species into an environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Alexandre|last2=Thévenin|first2=Charles|last3=Princé|first3=Karine|last4=Sarrazin|first4=François|last5=Clavel|first5=Joanne|date=2017-05-01|title=De-extinction and evolution|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12723/abstract|journal=Functional Ecology|language=en|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1031|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12723|issn=1365-2435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The term ''necrofauna'' is a [[portmanteau]] consisting of two [[morphemes]]. The first morpheme, “necro,” comes from the Greek prefix [[wikt:necro-#Prefix|''necro'']], meaning death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=necro-|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/necr-|website=Merriam Webstar|publisher=Merriam Webster Incorporated|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; “[[Fauna]],” meanwhile, refers to the animals that inhabit a particular time period or environment and is derived from the Greek name [[Fauna (deity)|''Fauna'']], the Roman goddess of earth and fertility.

[[Alex Steffen]] is referred to as the first person to coin the [[neologism]] “necrofauna” in Jason Mark’s ''[[Earth Island Institute|Earth Island Journal]]'' article titled “Back From the Dead.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mark|first1=Jason|title=Back From the Dead|journal=Earth Island Journal|date=September 3, 2013|issue=Autumn 2013|url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/back_from_the_dead/|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was used in the context of describing the phenomenon of "charismatic necrofauna," which expresses the possibility that only certain charismatic species may be chosen as candidates for de-extinction based on human preferences, or that such resurrection efforts could distract from helping less "charismatic" species that are currently endangered.

A '''nutrition scale''' is a weighing instrument that outputs precise nutritional information for foods or liquids. Most scales calculate [[calories]], [[carbohydrates]], and [[fat]]s, with more sophisticated scales calculating additional nutrients such as [[Vitamin K]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], and [[sodium]].

Scales often use [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] information on food to ensure accuracy. The products are used primarily as a weight-management tool but have found a user base with [[Diabetes|diabetics]] and [[Hypertension|hypertensive]] people.

[[File:Map showing the location of oceanic plateaus (in green) in the Australia-New Zealand region of the South Pacific.svg|thumb|Map showing the location of oceanic plateaus (in green) in the Australia-New Zealand region of the South Pacific]]
An '''oceanic''' or '''submarine plateau''' is a large, relatively flat elevation that is higher than the surrounding relief with one or more relatively steep sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|IHO|2013|p=2-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 184 oceanic plateaus covering an area of {{Convert|18,486,600|km2|abbr=on}}, or about 5.11% of the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|Macmillan-Lawler|Rupp|Baker|2014|loc=Plateaus (Supplementary Table 20), p. 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The South Pacific region around Australia and New Zealand contains the greatest number of oceanic plateaus (see map).

Oceanic plateaus produced by [[large igneous province]]s are often associated with [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]], [[mantle plume]]s, and [[volcanic island]]s&amp;nbsp;— such as Iceland, Hawaii, Cape Verde, and Kerguelen.  The three largest plateaus, the [[Caribbean large igneous province|Caribbean]], [[Ontong Java Plateau|Ontong Java]], and [[Mid-Pacific Mountains]], are located on [[Swell (geology)|thermal swells]].  Other oceanic plateaus, however, are made of rifted continental crust, for example [[Falkland Plateau]], [[Lord Howe Rise]], and parts of [[Kerguelen Plateau|Kerguelen]], [[Mascarene Plateau|Seychelles]], and Arctic ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mooney|Laske|Masters|1998|loc=Anomalous Crust: Oceanic Plateaus, Hotspots, and Rifts, pp. 754–755}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Plateaus formed by large igneous provinces were formed by the equivalent of continental [[flood basalt]]s such as the [[Deccan Traps]] in India and the [[Snake River Plain]] in the United States.

In contrast to continental flood basalts, most igneous oceanic plateaus erupt through young and thin ({{Convert|6|-|7|km|abbr=on}}) [[mafic]] or [[ultra-mafic]] crust and are therefore uncontaminated by felsic crust and representative for their mantle sources.
These plateaus often rise {{Convert|2|-|3|km|abbr=on}} above the surrounding ocean floor and are more buoyant than oceanic crust.  They therefore tend to withstand subduction, more-so when thick and when reaching subduction zones shortly after their formations.  As a consequence, they tend to "dock" to continental margins and be preserved as [[Accretion (geology)|accreted]] [[terrane]]s.  Such terranes are often better preserved than the exposed parts of continental flood basalts and are therefore a better record of large-scale volcanic eruptions throughout Earth's history.  This "docking" also means that oceanic plateaus are important contributors to the growth of continental crust.  Their formations often had a dramatic impact on global climate, such as the most recent plateaus formed, the three, large, Cretaceous oceanic plateaus in the Pacific and Indian Ocean: Ontong Java, Kerguelen, and Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kerr|2013|p=632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in crust–mantle recycling==
Geologists believe that igneous oceanic plateaus may well represent a stage in the development of [[continental crust]] as they are generally less dense than [[oceanic crust]] while still being denser than normal continental crust.

Density differences in crustal material largely arise from different ratios of various elements, especially [[silicon]]. Continental crust has the highest amount of silicon (such rock is called [[felsic]]). Oceanic crust has a smaller amount of silicon ([[mafic]] rock). Igneous oceanic plateaus have a ratio intermediate between continental and oceanic crust, although they are more mafic than felsic.

However, when a [[tectonic plate|plate]] carrying oceanic crust [[subduction|subducts]] under a plate carrying an igneous oceanic plateau, the volcanism which erupts on the plateau as the oceanic crust heats up on its descent into the mantle erupts material which is more felsic than the material which makes up the plateau.  This represents a step toward creating crust which is increasingly continental in character, being less dense and more buoyant.  If an igneous oceanic plateau is subducted underneath another one, or under existing continental crust, the eruptions produced thereby produce material that is yet more felsic, and so on through geologic time.

The '''performance gap''' is a term commonly used to denote the disparity that is found between the energy use predicted and carbon emissions in the design stage of buildings and the energy use of those buildings in operation. Research in the UK suggests that actual carbon emissions from new homes can be 2.5 times the design estimates, on average.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, J; Godoy-Shimizu, D; Tilson, A; Mawditt, I. 2016. Building Performance Evaluation Programme: Findings from domestic projects - Making reality match design. London: Innovate UK. Page 18&lt;/ref&gt; For non-domestic buildings, the gap is even higher - actual carbon emissions as much as 3.8 times the design estimates, on average.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, J; Terry, N; Armitage, P. 2016. Building Performance Evaluation Programme: Findings from non-domestic projects - Getting the best from buildings. London: Innovate UK. Page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

There are established tools for reducing the performance gap, by reviewing project objectives, outline and detailed design drawings, design calculations, implementation of designs on site, and post-occupancy evaluation. NEF's Assured Performance Process (APP) is one such tool, which is being used extensively on different sites that form part of East Hampshire's Whitehill and Bordon new town development, one of the largest regeneration projects anywhere in the UK, with high ambitions for both environmental performance and health.

==Classification of factors that contribute to the performance gap==
The performance gap is produced mainly due to uncertainties. Uncertainties are found in any “real-world” system, and buildings are no exception. As early as 1978, Gero and Dudnik wrote a paper presenting a methodology to solve the problem of designing subsystems ([[HVAC]]) subjected to uncertain demands. After that, other authors have shown an interest in the uncertainties that are present in building design; Ramallo-González classified uncertainties in building design/construction in three different groups:&lt;ref&gt;Ramallo-González, A.P. 2013. Modelling Simulation and Optimisation of Low-energy Buildings. PhD. University of Exeter.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Environmental. Uncertainty in weather prediction under changing climate; and uncertain weather data information due to the use of synthetic weather data files: (1) use of synthetic years that do not represent a real year, and (2) use of a synthetic year that has not been generated from recorded data in the exact location of the project but in the closest weather station.
# Workmanship and quality of building elements. Differences between the design and the real building: Conductivity of [[thermal bridges]], conductivity of [[insulator (electricity)|insulation]], value of infiltration or U-Values of walls and windows. There may be optimism bias by designers, where expectations about what is possible on site are unrealistic, and/or buildability fails to get adequate attention during design.
# Behavioural. All other parameters linked to human behaviour i.e. door and window opening, heating regimes&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, M; Palmer, J; Pope, P; Armitage, P. 2016. UK Housing Stock Models Using SAP: The Case for Heating Regime Change. Science Journal of Engineering 4 (2) 12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;, use of appliances, occupancy patterns or cooking habits.

===Type 1: Environmental uncertainties===
The type 1 from this grouping, have been divided here into two main groups: one concerning the uncertainty due to climate change; and the other concerning uncertainties due to the use of synthetic weather data files. Concerning the uncertainties due to climate change: buildings have long life spans, for example, in England and Wales, around 40% of the office blocks existing in 2004 were built before 1940 (30% if considered by floor area).&lt;ref&gt;ODPM, 2005. Age of Commercial and Industrial Stock: Local Authority Level 2004. London: Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.&lt;/ref&gt; and, 38.9% of English dwellings in 2007 were built before 1944.&lt;ref&gt;CLG, 2007. English House Condition Survey 2007, Annual report. Communities and Local Government&lt;/ref&gt; This long life span makes buildings likely to operate with climates that might change due to global warming. De Wilde and Coley showed how important is to design buildings that take into consideration climate change and that are able to perform well in future weathers.&lt;ref&gt;de Wilde, P. &amp; Coley, D., 2012. The implications of a changing climate for buildings. Building and Environment, 55, pp.1-7&lt;/ref&gt;
Concerning the uncertainties due to the use of synthetic weather data files: Wang et al. showed the impact that uncertainties in weather data (among others) may cause in energy demand calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, L., Mathew, P. &amp; Pang, X., 2012. Uncertainties in energy consumption introduced by building operations and weather for a medium-size office building. Energy and Buildings, 53, pp.152-158&lt;/ref&gt; The deviation in calculated energy use due to variability in the weather data were found to be different in different locations from a range of (-0.5% – 3%) in San Francisco to a range of (-4% to 6%) in Washington D.C. The ranges were calculated using TMY  as the reference. These deviations on the demand were smaller than the ones due to operational parameters. For those, the ranges were (-29% – 79%) for San Francisco and (-28% – 57%) for Washington D.C. The operation parameters were those linked with occupants’ behaviour. The conclusion of this paper is that occupants will have a larger impact in energy calculations than the variability between synthetically generated weather data files.
The spatial resolution of weather data files was the concern covered by Eames et al.&lt;ref&gt;Eames, M., Kershaw, T. &amp; Coley, D., 2011. The appropriate spatial resolution of future weather files for building simulation. Journal of Building Performance Simulation, 5, pp.1-12&lt;/ref&gt; Eames showed how a low spatial resolution of weather data files can be the cause of disparities of up to 40% in the heating demand.

===Type 2: Workmanship===
In the work of Pettersen, uncertainties of group 2 (workmanship and quality of elements) and group 3 (behaviour) of the previous grouping were considered (Pettersen, 1994).  This work shows how important occupants’ behaviour is on the calculation of the energy demand of a building. Pettersen showed that the total energy use follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation of around 7.6% when the uncertainties due to occupants are considered, and of around 4.0% when considering those generated by the properties of the building elements. 
A large study was carried out by Leeds Metropolitan at Stamford Brook. This project saw 700 dwellings built to high efficiency standards.&lt;ref&gt;Wingfield, J., Bell, M., Miles-Shenton, D., South, T. &amp; Lowe, B., 2011. Evaluating the impact of an enhanced energy performance standard on load-bearing masonry domestic construction, Understanding the gap between designed and real performance: Lessons from Stamford Brook. London: Department for Communities and Local Government&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this project show a significant gap between the energy used expected before construction and the actual energy use once the house is occupied. The workmanship is analysed in this work. The authors emphasise the importance of thermal bridges that were not considered for the calculations, and how those originated by the internal partitions that separate dwellings have the largest impact on the final energy use. The dwellings that were monitored in use in this study show a large difference between the real energy use and that estimated using SAP, with one of them giving +176% of the expected value when in use.

Hopfe has published several papers concerning uncertainties in building design that cover workmanship. A more recent publication at the time of writing &lt;ref&gt;Hopfe, C.J. &amp; Hensen, J.L.M., 2011. Uncertainty analysis in building performance simulation for design support. Energy and Buildings, 43, pp.2798-2805&lt;/ref&gt; looks into uncertainties of group 2 and 3. In this work the uncertainties are defined as normal distributions. The random parameters are sampled to generate 200 tests that are sent to the simulator (VA114), the results from which will be analysed to check the uncertainties with the largest impact on the energy calculations. This work showed that the uncertainty in the value used for infiltration is the factor that is likely to have the largest influence on cooling and heating demands. 
Another study performed by de Wilde and Wei Tian,&lt;ref&gt;de Wilde, P. &amp; Tian, W., 2009. Identification of key factors for uncertainty in the prediction of the thermal performance of an office building under climate change. Building Simulation, 2, pp.157-174&lt;/ref&gt; compared the impact of most of the uncertainties affecting building energy calculations taking into account climate change. De Wilde and Tian used a two dimensional Monte Carlo Analysis to generate a database obtained with 7280 runs of a building simulator. A sensitivity analysis was applied to this database to obtain the most significant factors on the variability of the energy demand calculations. Standardised Regression Coefficients and Standardised Rank Regression Coefficients were used to compare the impacts of the uncertainties. 

De Wilde and Tian agreed with Hopfe on the impact of uncertainties in the infiltration over energy calculations, but also introduced other factors, including uncertainties in: weather, U-Value of windows, and other variables related with occupants’ behaviour (equipment and lighting). Their paper compares many of the uncertainties with a good sized database providing a realistic comparison for the scope of the sampling of the uncertainties. 
The work of Schnieders and Hermelink &lt;ref&gt;Schnieders, J. &amp; Hermelink, A., 2006. CEPHEUS results: measurements and occupants’ satisfaction provide evidence for Passive Houses being an option for sustainable building. Energy Policy, 34, pp.151-171&lt;/ref&gt; showed a substantial variability in the energy demands of low-energy buildings designed under the same specification (Passivhaus).

===Type 3: Occupants===
The work of Schnieders and Hermelink &lt;ref&gt;Schnieders, J. &amp; Hermelink, A., 2006. CEPHEUS results: measurements and occupants’ satisfaction provide evidence for Passive Houses being an option for sustainable building. Energy Policy, 34, pp.151-171&lt;/ref&gt; showed a substantial variability in the energy demands of low-energy buildings designed under the same specification (Passivhaus). Although the passivhaus standard has a very controlled, high quality workmanship, large differences have been seen in energy demand in different houses.
 
Blight and Coley &lt;ref&gt;Blight, T.S., Coley D. A., 2012 The impact of occupant behaviour on the energy consumption of low-energy dwellings, 2nd Conference on Building Energy and Environment. Boulder, USA&lt;/ref&gt; showed that that variability can be occasioned due to variance in occupant behaviour (it should be noted that the use of windows and doors was included in this work). The work of Blight and Coley proves two things: (1) Occupants have a substantial influence on energy use; and (2) The model they used to generate occupants’ behaviour is accurate for the creation of behavioural patterns of inhabitants. 
 
The method used in the previous paper &lt;ref&gt;Blight, T.S., Coley D. A., 2012 The impact of occupant behaviour on the energy consumption of low-energy dwellings, 2nd Conference on Building Energy and Environment. Boulder, USA&lt;/ref&gt; to generate accurate profiles of occupants’ behaviour was the one developed by Richardson et al.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, I., Thomson, M. &amp; Infield, D., 2008. A high-resolution domestic building occupancy model for energy demand simulations. Energy and Buildings, 40, pp.1560-1566&lt;/ref&gt; The method was developed using the Time-Use Survey (TUS) of the United Kingdom as a reference of real behaviour of occupants, this database was elaborated after recording the activity of more than 6000 occupants in 24-hours diaries with a 10 minutes resolution . Richardson’s paper shows how the tool is able to generate behavioural patterns that correlate with the real data obtained from the TUS.
The availability of this tool allows scientist’s to model the uncertainty of occupants’ behaviour as a set of behavioural patterns that have been proven to correlate with real occupants’ behaviour. 
There have been works published to take into account occupancy in optimisation using the so called robust optimisation &lt;ref&gt;Ramallo-González, A. P., Blight, T., Coley, D. A. 2015, New optimisation methodology to uncover robust low energy designs that accounts for occupant behaviour or other unknowns, Journal of Building Engineering. 2 pp. 59-68, doi:10.1016/j.jobe.2015.05.001&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophy of psychology''' refers to the many issues at the theoretical foundations of modern [[psychology]]. 

==Overview==
Some of the issues studied by the philosophy of psychology are [[epistemological]] concerns about the [[methodology]] of psychological investigation. For example:
* What is the most appropriate methodology for psychology: [[mentalism (psychology)|mentalism]], [[behaviorism]], or a compromise?
* Are self-reports a reliable data-gathering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = R. Stewart Ellis | publisher = Kettering University | title = Research data gathering techniques | year = 2010 |url = https://paws.kettering.edu/~ellis/mycourse/ssci201/r-d-g-t-good-bad.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; method?
* What conclusions can be drawn from [[null hypothesis]] tests?
* Can first-person experiences (emotions, desires, beliefs, etc.) be measured objectively?

Other issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, [[brain]], and [[cognition]], and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of [[cognitive science]], or [[philosophy of mind]], such as:
* What is a [[cognitive module]]?
* Are humans [[rationality|rational]] creatures?
* What psychological phenomena come up to the standard required for calling it [[knowledge]]?
* What is [[innate]]ness?

Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[artificial intelligence]], for example questioning whether psychological phenomena can be explained using the methods of [[neuroscience]], [[evolutionary theory]], and computational modeling, respectively. Although these are all closely related fields, some concerns still arise about the appropriateness of importing their methods into psychology. Some such concerns are whether psychology, as the study of individuals as information processing systems (see [[Donald Broadbent]]), is autonomous from what happens in the brain (even if psychologists largely agree that the brain in some sense causes behavior (see [[supervenience]])); whether the mind is "hard-wired" enough for evolutionary investigations to be fruitful; and whether computational models can do anything more than offer possible implementations of cognitive theories that tell us nothing about the mind (Fodor &amp; Pylyshyn 1988).

Philosophy of psychology is a relatively young field because "scientific" psychology—that is, psychology that favors experimental methods over [[introspection]]—came to dominate psychological studies only in the late 19th century. One of philosophy of psychology's concerns is to evaluate the merits of the many different schools of psychology that have been and are practiced. For example, [[cognitive psychology]]'s use of internal mental states might be compared with [[behaviorism]], and the reasons for the widespread rejection of behaviorism in the mid-20th century examined.

Topics that fall within [[philosophy of mind]] go back much farther. For example, questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[monism]] have been discussed in philosophy for many centuries.

Related to philosophy of psychology are philosophical and epistemological inquiries about [[clinical psychiatry]] and [[psychopathology]]. Philosophy of psychiatry is mainly concerned with the role of values in psychiatry: derived from philosophical [[value theory]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], values-based practice is aimed at improving and humanizing clinical decision-making in the highly complex environment of mental health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Fulford KWM, Stanghellini G. |title=The Third Revolution: Philosophy into Practice in Twenty-first Century Psychiatry |journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=5–14 |year=2008 |url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/fulford.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy of psychopathology is mainly involved in the epistemological reflection about the implicit philosophical foundations of [[psychiatric]] classification and evidence-based psychiatry. Its aim is to unveil the constructive activity underlying the description of mental phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Aragona M |title=Il mito dei fatti.

The '''pileus area index''' is the technical name for the size of what is commonly known as the "[[pileus (mycology)|cap]]" of a fungal [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting body]]. It was coined by [[Asher Tarivona Mutsengi]], a  researcher at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].  It is particularly characteristic of [[agarics]], [[boletes]], and some [[polypores]], [[tooth fungi]], and [[ascocarps]].

{{Wiktionary|platitude}}
A '''platitude''' is a trite, meaningless, or prosaic statement, often used as a [[thought-terminating cliché]], aimed at quelling social, emotional, or cognitive unease.&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt;

Platitudes have been criticized as giving a false impression of wisdom, making it easy to accept falsehoods:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A platitude is even worse than a cliché. It’s a sanctimonious cliché, a statement that is not only old and overused but often moralistic and imperious. ... [P]latitudes have an aphoristic quality, they seem like timeless moral lessons. They therefore shape our view of the world, and can lull us into accepting things that are actually false and foolish.&lt;ref name="robinson"&gt;Nathan J. Robinson, "The Uses of Platitudes", ''Current Affairs'', August 23, 2017 [https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/08/the-uses-of-platitudes online]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Platitudes often take the form of [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], e.g., "it is what it is", making them appear vacuously true. But the phrase is used to mean "there is no way of changing it", which is no longer a tautology: "Structuring the sentiment as a tautology allows it to appear inescapable."&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt;

At the same time, some phrases that have become platitudes may provide useful moral guidance, such as [[Golden Rule|"do unto others as you would have them do unto you"]]. Others, though widely trivialized, may be thought-provoking, such as "Be the change you wish to see in the world".&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt;

==Examples==
* Better late than never.
* Every cloud has a silver lining.
* Forgive and forget.
* Go with the flow.
* Good things come to those who wait.
* It is what it is.
* Just be yourself.
* Money can't buy happiness.
* Nice guys finish last.
* No good deed goes unpunished.
* Nobody's perfect.
* Strength is something you choose.
* Such is life.
* This too shall pass.
* Time will tell.
* Tomorrow is another day.
* What's done is done.
* You gotta do what you gotta do.
* [[What does not kill me makes me stronger (disambiguation)|What does not kill me makes me stronger]].

==In philosophy==

In philosophy, platitudes are beliefs or assertions about a topic that are generally accepted as [[common sense]]. In some approaches to [[conceptual analysis]], they are taken as a starting point. Conjoining the platitudes on a topic may give a [[Ramsey sentence]]. Analyzing platitudes is part of the [[Canberra Plan]] of [[philosophical methodology]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Nolan, "Platitudes and metaphysics", in David Braddon-Mitchell &amp; Robert Nola (eds.), ''Conceptual Analysis and Philosophical Naturalism'', MIT Press, 2009 [https://philpapers.org/go.pl?id=NOLPAM&amp;proxyId=none&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fdanielnolanphil.googlepages.com%2FNolanPandM.pdf full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The word is a borrowing from the French compound ''platitude'', from ''plat'' 'flat' + ''-(i)tude'' '-ness', thus 'flatness'. The figurative sense is first attested in French in 1694 in the meaning 'the quality of banality' and in 1740 in the meaning 'a commonplace remark'. It is first attested in English in 1762.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/145403 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Prochlorococcus''''' is a [[genus]] of very small (0.6&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]]) [[Ocean|marine]] [[cyanobacteria]] with an unusual pigmentation ([[Chlorophyll|chlorophyll ''a2'' and ''b2'']]). These bacteria belong to the [[photosynthetic picoplankton]] and are probably the most abundant [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organism on Earth. ''Prochlorococcus'' microbes are among the major [[primary producers]] in the ocean, responsible for a large percentage of the photosynthetic production of [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name="Munn"&gt;Munn, C.

Olson of the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], and other collaborators in the [[Sargasso Sea]] using [[flow cytometry]]. The first culture of ''Prochlorococcus'' was isolated in the Sargasso Sea in 1988 ([[strain (biology)|strain]] SS120) and shortly another strain was obtained from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (strain MED).

The only species of the genus that has been described is ''Prochlorococcus marinus''.

==Morphology==
Marine cyanobacteria are to date the smallest known [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms; ''Prochlorococcus'' is the smallest at just 0.5 to 0.7 micrometres in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biller|first1=Steven J.|last2=Berube|first2=Paul M.|last3=Lindell|first3=Debbie|last4=Chisholm|first4=Sallie W.|title=Prochlorococcus: the structure and function of collective diversity|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|date=1 December 2014|volume=13|issue=1|pages=13–27|doi=10.1038/nrmicro3378|pmid=25435307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The coccoid shaped cells are non-motile and free-living.

==Pigments==
''Prochlorococcus'' is closely related to ''[[Synechococcus]],'' another abundant photosynthetic cyanobacteria, which contains the light-harvesting antennae phycobilisomes. However, ''Prochlorochoccus'' has evolved to use a unique light-harvesting complex, consisting predominantly of divinyl derivatives of chlorophyll a (Chl a2) and b (Chl b2) and lacking monovinyl chlorophylls and phycobilisomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ting CS, Rocap G, King J, Chisholm S |year=2002 |title=Cyanobacterial photosynthesis in the oceans: the origins and significance of divergent light-harvesting strategies |journal=[[Trends in Microbiology]] |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=134–142 |doi=10.1016/s0966-842x(02)02319-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prochlorococcus'' is the only known wild-type oxygenic phototroph that does not contain Chl a as a major photosynthetic pigment, and is the only known prokaryote with α-carotene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goericke R, Repeta D|lastauthoramp=yes |year=1992 |title=The pigments of Prochlorococcus marinus: the presence of divinyl chlorophyll a and b in a marine prokaryote |journal=[[Limnology and Oceanography]] |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=425–433 |doi=10.4319/lo.1992.37.2.0425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Prochlorococcus'' occupies two distinct niches, leading to the nomenclature of the low light (LL) and high light (HL) groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=N. J. West  |author2=D. J. Scanlan  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1999 |title=Niche-partitioning of ''Prochlorococcus'' in a stratified water column in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean |journal=[[Applied and Environmental Microbiology]] |volume=65 |pages=2585–2591}}&lt;/ref&gt; which vary in pigment ratios (LL has a high ratio of chlorophyll b2:a2 and HL has a low ratio of b2:a2), light requirements, nitrogen and phosphorus utilization, copper, and virus sensitivity.  These "[[ecotypes]]" can be differentiated on the basis of the sequence of their [[ribosomal RNA]] gene. High-light adapted strains inhabit depths between 25 and 100 m, while low-light adapted strains inhabit waters between 80 and 200 m.&lt;ref name="Martiny"/&gt; Recently the genomes of several strains of ''Prochlorococcus'' have been sequenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G.

==Ecology==
Despite Prochlorococcus being one of the smallest types of marine phytoplankton/bacteria in the worlds oceans, its substantial number makes it responsible for a major part of the oceans’ and world’s photosynthesis and oxygen production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The size of Prochlorococcus (i.e. around 0.5 to 0.7 micrometers in diameter)&lt;ref name="Partensky" /&gt; and the adaptations of the various ecotypes allow the organism to grow abundantly in low nutrient waters such as the waters of the tropics and the subtropics (~40N to 40S),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Partensky, Blanchot, Vaulot|title=DifferentiaI distribution and ecology of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus in oceanic waters: a review|journal=Bulletin de l'Institut océanographique. Monaco. n°|date=1999|volume=spécial 19|issue=spécial 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; however they can be found in higher latitudes as high up as 60° degrees north but at fairly minimal concentrations and the bacteria's distribution across the oceans suggest that the colder waters could be fatal to it. This wide range of latitude along with the bacteria’s ability to survive up to depths of 100 to 150 meters i.e. the average depth of the mixing layer of the surface ocean, allows it to grow to enormous numbers, up to 3 octillion individuals worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erik R.

Along with Synechococcus(another species of cyanobacteria that coexist with prochlorococcus) these cyanobacteria is responsible for approximately 50% of marine carbon fixation, making it an important carbon sink via the biological carbon pump(i.e. the transfer of organic carbon from the surface ocean to the deep via several biological, physical and chemical processes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fei-Xue Fu, Mark E.

'''Protoplast''', from [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|πρωτόπλαστος}} (''prōtóplastos'', "first-formed"), is a [[biology|biological]] term proposed by [[Johannes von Hanstein|Hanstein]] in 1880 to refer to the entire cell, excluding the cell wall,&lt;ref&gt;Hanstein, J. 1880. ''[https://archive.org/details/DasProtoplasma Das Protoplasma]''. Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, L. W. (1921). ''[https://archive.org/details/introductiontocy032473mbp Introduction To Cytology]''. New York: McGraw Hill, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; but currently has several definitions:
* a [[plant]], [[bacterium|bacterial]] or [[fungus|fungal]] cell that had its [[cell wall]] completely or partially removed using either mechanical or enzymatic means. A further differentiation can be made for bacteria:
** protoplasts: have their cell wall entirely removed and are derived from gram + ([[Gram-positive bacteria|gram-positive]])
** [[spheroplast]]s: have their cell wall only partially removed and are gram − ([[Gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]])
* more generally, a unit of biology which is composed of a cell's [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and the surrounding [[protoplasm]]ic materials.

==Enzymes for the preparation of protoplasts==
Cell walls are made of a variety of [[polysaccharide]]s.  Protoplasts can be made by degrading cell walls with a mixture of the appropriate polysaccharide-degrading [[enzyme]]s:
{|  class="wikitable" border="1" cellpadding="2"
!Type of cell
!Enzyme
|-
| [[Plant cell]]s
|[[Cellulase]], [[pectinase]], [[xylanase]]
|-
| [[Gram-positive]] bacteria 
| [[Lysozyme]] (+[[EDTA]])
|-
| [[Fungus|Fungal]] cells
| [[Chitinase]]
|}
During and subsequent to digestion of the cell wall, the protoplast becomes very sensitive to [[osmosis|osmotic]] stress.  This means cell wall digestion and protoplast storage must be done in an [[Tonicity#Isotonicity|isotonic solution]] to prevent rupture of the [[plasma membrane]].

==Uses for protoplasts==
[[File:Protoplast fusion.jpg|thumb|right|Fused protoplast (on left), containing both chloroplasts (from a leaf cell) as well as a  coloured vacuole (from a petal).]] 
Protoplasts can be used to study [[biological membrane|membrane]] biology, including the uptake of [[macromolecule]]s and  [[virus]]es . These are also used in [[somaclonal variation]].

Protoplasts are widely used for [[DNA]] [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] (for making [[genetically modified organism]]s), since the cell wall would otherwise block the passage of DNA into the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davey MR, Anthony P, Power JB, Lowe KC |title=Plant protoplasts: status and biotechnological perspectives |journal=Biotechnol. Adv. |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=131–71 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15694124 |doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2004.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of plant cells, protoplasts may be regenerated into whole plants first by growing into a group of plant cells that develops into a [[Callus (cell biology)|callus]] and then by regeneration of shoots ([[caulogenesis]]) from the callus using [[plant tissue culture]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12033-007-0031-3 |author=Thorpe TA |title=History of plant tissue culture |journal=Mol. Biotechnol. |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=169–80 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17914178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth of protoplasts into callus and regeneration of shoots requires the proper balance of plant growth regulators in the tissue culture medium that must be customized for each species of plant. Unlike protoplasts from [[vascular plant]]s, protoplasts from [[moss]]es, such as ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'', do not need [[phytohormone]]s for regeneration, nor do they form a callus during [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]]. Instead, they regenerate directly into the filamentous [[protonema]], mimicking a germinating moss spore.&lt;ref&gt;S.C. Bhatla, Justine Kiessling, [[Ralf Reski]] (2002): [http://www.springerlink.com/content/m747f7xfu9dxyprw/?p=2747894a7a9849a09e60b0e49f51afdc&amp;pi=3Observation of polarity induction by cytochemical localization of phenylalkylamine-binding receptors in regenerating protoplasts of the moss Physcomitrella patens]. Protoplasma 219, 99–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Protoplasts may also be used for [[plant breeding]], using a technique called [[protoplast fusion]].  Protoplasts from different species are induced to fuse by using an [[electric field]] or a solution of [[polyethylene glycol]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Hain and A.P. Czernilofsky et al. (1985). "Uptake, integration, expression and genetic transmission of a selectable chimaeric gene by plant protoplasts". ''Mol Gen Genet'' 199:161–168.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique may be used to generate [[somatic hybrid]]s in tissue culture.

Additionally, protoplasts of plants expressing fluorescent proteins in certain cells may be used for Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), where only cells fluorescing a selected wavelength are retained. Among other things, this technique is used to isolate specific cell types (e.g., [[guard cells]] from leaves, [[pericycle]] cells from roots) for further investigations, such as transcriptomics.

'''Roderick Frazier Nash''' is a professor emeritus of history and environmental studies at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]].  He was the first person to descend the [[Tuolumne River]] (using a raft).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

== Scholarly biography ==
Nash received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1960 and his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;http://aapra.org/pugsley-bios/roderick-frazier-nash&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the author of several books and many essays. His [[dissertation]], "Wilderness and the American Mind," done under the supervision of [[Merle Curti]], became what has come to be seen as one of the foundational texts of the field of [[environmental history]]. After teaching for two years at [[Dartmouth College]], he was called to the growing History Department at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] where he joined distinguished historians such as [[Wilbur Jacobs]], [[Robert O. Collins]], [[Frank J. Frost]], [[C. Warren Hollister]], [[Leonard Marsak]], and [[Joachim Remak]]. After witnessing a massive oil spill in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] in 1969 he and a number of other faculty members became active within the University and founded an environmental studies program there in 1970.  Since the initial 12 graduates in 1972, there have been 4,000 graduates within 300 separate majors.  Nash is a firm believer in environmental education and is also an avid [[white water rafting|white-water river rafter]].

== ''Wilderness and the American Mind'' ==

Nash's study in this book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3PJZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=20oNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4335,743719&amp;dq=roderick-nash+raft&amp;hl=en|title=Parks Subject of New Special|date=March 7, 1981|work=[[Waycross Journal-Herald]]|page=P5|accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerns the attitude of Americans' toward the idea of wilderness. He discusses the different attitudes that American's have had toward nature since colonization and the changing uses and definitions of 'wilderness'in that context. Specifically, Nash describes the evolution of American wilderness conception through Transcendentalism, Primitivism, Preservationism, to Conservationism.&lt;ref name="Wilderness and the American Mind, Nash 1973" /&gt; Nash states that if wilderness is to survive, we must, paradoxically, manage wilderness – at the very least, our behavior towards the wilderness must be managed.

== Personal Philosophy ==

Nash presents America's anthropocentric view as the main enemy to all wilderness preservation.  He argues that an ecocentric view is ideal and may work in the long run, but perhaps the preservation of nature and wilderness for the sake of holding resources out for the preservation of our own species would be more salient. Yet, even this strategy is hard for people to grasp, because it requires us to reach outside the present and look to the future. Still, Nash suggests that maybe the simple preservation of the environment for the sake of our own generation's recreation and health (oxygen sinks, etc.) could provide the impetus to slow some profiteering.

Nash also talks of how wilderness teaches us the value of humility. The problem is that humanity does not want to be humbled.  Humans are a proud species who will do anything to avoid being humbled.  To this end, we have ripped the wildness from the wilderness and removed all that causes any threat to our existence.

Nash believes that humankind has two choices in the next 1,000 years. We can "trash the planet into a wasteland" or adopt a plan to distill the world's population in 500 "islands" while allowing wilderness to flourish around us.

The '''Sea Fish Industry Authority''' (or '''Seafish''') is a [[non-departmental public body]] in the [[United Kingdom]] sponsored by the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]].  Established in 1981, and charged with working with the UK seafood industry to promote good quality, sustainable seafood. Seafish revised its mission in 2018. Its new mission is: "Seafood is the way Forward".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marcus |first1=Coleman |title=Corporate Plan |url=http://www.seafish.org/about-seafish/corporate-plan |website=Seafish |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Seafish was established in the United Kingdom under the [[Fisheries Act 1981]] through the amalgamation of the '''Herring Industry Board''' (founded in 1934)&lt;ref name="HDM"&gt;{{cite news |title=EIGHT MEN—THE HERRING INDUSTRY'S FATE IN THEIR HANDS|work=Hull Daily Mail |date=8 March 1935 |accessdate=18 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000324/19350308/200/0024| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''White Fish Authority''' (founded in 1951).&lt;ref name="AEE"&gt;{{cite news |title=White Fish Authority |work=Aberdeen Evening Express |date=13 February 1951 |accessdate=18 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000445/19510213/059/0006| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, 12 January 1981, column 824. The Minister was Mr [[Alick Buchanan-Smith (politician)|Alick Buchanan-Smith]]. [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/02/09104458/9 "Scottish Executive website"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Seafish has its administrative base in the Scottish city of [[Edinburgh]] and has its research &amp; development base in [[Grimsby]], the UK's main base for the fishing industry and [[frozen food]]. The organisation in Grimsby moved into the new Humber Seafood Institute, run by the [[Grimsby Institute of Further &amp; Higher Education|Grimsby Institute]], on July 2008. It was formerly based on [[St Andrew's Dock|St Andrews Dock]] in Hull.

Seafish carries out research and projects aimed at raising standards, improving efficiency and ensuring the sustainable development of the industry. As well as supplying training and [[Research and development|R&amp;D]], Seafish operates accreditation schemes for [[Fish and chips|fish &amp; chip shop]]s, [[Fisherman|fishermen]], [[wholesalers]] and processors. Seafish has an economics team which collects, interprets and disseminates data about various UK seafood sectors.

==Funding==
Seafish is sponsored by the fisheries departments of the [[Her Majesty's Government|four UK governments]] and is funded by a [[Tax|levy]] across all sectors of the fisheries and seafood industry. This levy is due on all first-hand purchases of sea fish, [[shellfish]], and sea fish products including [[fish meal]] landed in the United Kingdom. This includes imports, which make up more than 75% of UK seafood consumption, as well as the domestic catch landed in the UK, the majority of which is exported.

==Seafish services==

===Economics===
Seafish is a source of economic information for industry and policy makers on the fishing, supply and processing industries conducting surveys and analyses of the UK fleet and processing sectors, including trends in costs and earnings and economics impact multipliers. The Economics department also produces strategic analyses such as the 'Seafood Strategic Outlook' and fleet futures modelling.

===Research and Development===
Seafish carried out research and projects to improve efficiency and seafood quality and obtain best value for money for the UK seafood industry. The 16-strong team is based around the UK.

A number of research and development projects are funded through the Seafish Industry Project Fund. During 2006 and 2007, over £2.5 million has been invested in 47 projects which have funded research and development partnership projects, grant assistance for innovative ideas and bursaries for students.

===Seafood Information Network (SIN)===
Seafish has created SIN, an information portal for the global seafood industry. SIN is an internet-based data source for business, researchers and service providers. http://sin.seafish.org

===Seafish Responsible Fishing Scheme===
'''The Seafish Responsible Fishing Scheme''' is a BSi Publicly Available Specification (PAS 72:2006) awarded to individual vessels for vessel operations and traceability in the sea fishing industry. It specifies requirements relating to fishing practices, vessel criteria, crew competence, environmental considerations and record maintenance. It is applicable to the supply chain from the fisherman to the point of first sale. In late 2009 around 500 vessels are involved in the scheme with 325 vessels fully certified covering about 70% of UK landings by weight. The scheme is independently audited by UKAS approved auditors.

'''''The Biology of the Cell Surface''''' is a book by American biologist [[Ernest Everett Just]]. It was published by P. Blakiston’s Son &amp; Co in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/6379|accessdate=15 March 2012|title=The biology of the cell surface, by Ernest Everett Just|publisher=Biodiversity Heritage Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just began writing the book in 1934 in Naples and finished it in France, shortly before being sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. He considered the book to be his "crowning achievement". The book examined the role of the cell surface in embryology, development and evolution, and presented a critique of [[gene theory]], particularly the views of [[Jacques Loeb]]. Sapp suggests that "Just’s theorizing on the cell cortex [in this work] was unsurpassed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sapp|first=J|title="Just" in time: gene theory and the biology of the cell surface.|journal=Molecular reproduction and development|date=Oct 2009|volume=76|issue=10|pages=903–11|pmid=19396869|doi=10.1002/mrd.21044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19397">The '''X-machine''' (''XM'') is a theoretical model of [[computation]] introduced by [[Samuel Eilenberg]] in 1974.&lt;ref
  name="Eil74"&gt;S. Eilenberg (1974)
  ''Automata, Languages and Machines, Vol. A''. 
  Academic Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''X'' in "X-machine" represents the fundamental data type on which the machine operates; for example, a machine that operates on databases (objects of type ''database'') would be a ''database''-machine. The X-machine model is structurally the same as the [[finite state machine]], except that the symbols used to label the machine's transitions denote [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] of type ''X''→''X''. Crossing a transition is equivalent to applying the relation that labels it (computing a set of changes to the data type ''X''), and traversing a path in the machine corresponds to applying all the associated relations, one after the other.

==Original theory ==

Eilenberg's original X-machine was a completely general theoretical model of computation (subsuming the [[Turing machine]], for example), which admitted deterministic, non-deterministic and non-terminating computations.  His seminal work &lt;ref name="Eil74" /&gt; published many variants of the basic X-machine model, each of which generalized the [[finite state machine]] in a slightly different way.

In the most general model, an X-machine is essentially a "machine for manipulating objects of type X". Suppose that X is some [[datatype]], called the ''fundamental datatype'', and that Φ is a set of (partial) relations φ: X → X. An X-machine is a [[finite state machine]] whose arrows are labelled by relations in Φ. In any given state, one or more transitions may be ''enabled'' if the [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the associated relation φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; accepts (a subset of) the current values stored in X.  In each cycle, all enabled transitions are assumed to be taken.  Each recognised path through the machine generates a list φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of relations. We call the composition φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ... &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of these relations the ''path relation'' corresponding to that path. The ''behaviour'' of the X-machine is defined to be the union of all the behaviours computed by its path relations. In general, this is non-deterministic, since applying any relation computes a set of outcomes on X. In the formal model, all possible outcomes are considered together, in parallel.

For practical purposes, an X-machine should describe some finite computation.  An encoding function α: Y → X converts from some ''input'' data type Y into the initial state of X, and a decoding function β: X → Z, converts back from the final state(s) of X into some ''output'' data type Z.  Once the initial state of X is populated, the X-machine runs to completion, and the outputs are then observed.  In general, a machine may deadlock (be blocked), or livelock (never halt), or perform one or more complete computations.  For this reason, more recent research has focused on deterministic X-machines, whose behaviour can be controlled and observed more precisely.

=== Example ===

A compiler with a peep-hole optimizer can be thought of as a machine for optimizing program structure.  In this '''Optimizer'''-machine, the encoding function α takes source code from the input-type Y (the program source) and loads it into the memory-type X (a parse tree).  Suppose that the machine has several states, called '''FindIncrements''', '''FindSubExprs''' and '''Completed'''.  The machine starts in the initial state '''FindIncrements''', which is linked to other states via the transitions:

  '''FindIncrements''' →&lt;sup&gt;'''DoIncrement'''&lt;/sup&gt; '''FindIncrements'''
  '''FindIncrements''' →&lt;sup&gt;'''SkipIncrement'''&lt;/sup&gt; '''FindSubExprs'''
  '''FindSubExprs''' →&lt;sup&gt;'''DoSubExpr'''&lt;/sup&gt; '''FindSubExprs'''
  '''FindSubExprs''' →&lt;sup&gt;'''SkipSubExpr'''&lt;/sup&gt; '''Completed'''

The relation '''DoIncrement''' maps a parsed subtree corresponding to "x := x + 1" into the optimized subtree "++x".  The relation '''DoSubExpr''' maps a parse tree containing multiple occurrences of the same expression "x + y ... x + y" into an optimized version with a local variable to store the repeated computation "z := x + y; ... z ... z".  These relations are only enabled if X contains the domain values (subtrees) on which they operate.  The remaining relations '''SkipIncrement''' and '''SkipSubExpr''' are ''nullops'' (identity relations) enabled in the complementary cases.

So, the '''Optimizer'''-machine will run to completion, first converting trivial additions into in-place increments (while in the '''FindIncrements''' state), then it will move on to the '''FindSubExprs''' state and perform a series of common sub-expression removals, after which it will move to the final state '''Completed'''.  The decoding function β will then map from the memory-type X (the optimized parse-tree) into the output-type Z (optimized machine code).

=== Convention ===

When referring to Eilenberg's original model, "X-machine" is typically written with a lower-case "m", because the sense is "any machine for processing X".  When referring to later specific models, the convention is to use a capital "M" as part of the proper name of that variant.

==1980s==
Interest in the X-machine was revived in the late 1980s by Mike Holcombe,&lt;ref
  name="Hol88a"&gt;M. Holcombe (1988)
  'X-machines as a basis for dynamic system specification',
  ''Software Engineering Journal'' '''3'''(2), pp. 69-76.&lt;/ref&gt; who noticed that the model was ideal for software [[formal specification]] purposes, because it cleanly separates ''control flow'' from ''processing''. Provided one works at a sufficiently abstract level, the control flows in a computation can usually be represented as a finite state machine, so to complete the X-machine specification all that remains is to specify the processing associated with each of the machine's transitions. The structural simplicity of the model makes it extremely flexible; other early illustrations of the idea included Holcombe's specification of human-computer interfaces,&lt;ref
  name="Hol88b"&gt;M. Holcombe (1988)
  'Formal methods in the specification of the human-machine interface', 
  ''International J. Command and Control, Communications and Info. Systems.'' '''2''', pp. 24-34.&lt;/ref&gt;
his modelling of processes in cell biochemistry,&lt;ref
  name="Hol86"&gt;M. Holcombe (1986)
  'Mathematical models of cell biochemistry'. 
  Technical Report CS-86-4, Dept of Computer Science, Sheffield University.&lt;/ref&gt;

  'An organisational approach to decision-making in command systems.' 
  ''International J. Command and Control, Communications and Info. Systems.'' '''1''', pp. 23-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s==
X-machines have received renewed attention since the mid-1990s, when Gilbert Laycock's deterministic [[Stream X-Machine]]&lt;ref name="Lay"&gt;Gilbert Laycock (1993) ''The Theory and Practice of Specification Based Software Testing''. PhD Thesis, University of Sheffield.

==2000s==
X-machines have been applied to [[lexical semantics]] by [[Andras Kornai]],  who models word meaning by `pointed' machines that have one member of the base set X distinguished.&lt;ref name="Kornai"&gt;A.

== Major variants ==

The X-machine is rarely encountered in its original form, but underpins several subsequent models of computation.  The most influential model on theories of software testing has been the [[Stream X-Machine]].  [[NASA]] has recently discussed using a combination of [[Communicating X-Machine|Communicating Stream X-Machines]] and the process calculus WSCSS in the design and testing of ''swarm satellite'' systems.&lt;ref name="HRRT05" /&gt;

=== Analog X Machine (AXM) ===

The earliest variant, the continuous-time ''Analog X-Machine'' (''AXM''), was introduced by Mike Stannett in 1990 as a potentially "super-Turing" model of computation;&lt;ref
  name="Sta90"&gt;M. Stannett (1990) 
  'X-machines and the Halting Problem: Building a super-Turing machine'. 
  ''Formal Aspects of Computing'' '''2''', pp. 331-41.&lt;/ref&gt;
it is consequently related to work in [[hypercomputation]] theory.&lt;ref
  name="Cop02"&gt;B. J. Copeland (2002) 
  'Hypercomputation'. 
  ''Minds and Machines'' '''12''', pp. 461-502.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stream X-Machine (SXM) ===
{{main|Stream X-Machine}}
The most commonly encountered X-machine variant is Gilbert Laycock's 1993 ''[[Stream X-Machine]]'' (''[[SXM (computational model)|SXM]]'') model,&lt;ref name="Lay" /&gt;
which forms the basis for Mike Holcombe and Florentin Ipate's theory of ''complete'' software testing, which guarantees known correctness properties, once testing is over.&lt;ref name="HI98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IH98"&gt;F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (1998) 'A method for refining and testing generalised machine specifications'.
  ''Int. J. Comp. Math.'' '''68''', pp. 197-219.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Stream X-Machine differs from Eilenberg's original model, in that the fundamental data type X is of the form ''Out''* × ''Mem'' × ''In''*, where ''In''* is an input sequence, ''Out''* is an output sequence, and ''Mem'' is the (rest of the) memory.

The advantage of this model is that it allows a system to be driven, one step at a time, through its states and transitions, while observing the outputs at each step.  These are witness values, that guarantee that particular functions were executed on each step.  As a result, complex software systems may be decomposed into a hierarchy of Stream X-Machines, designed in a top-down way and tested in a bottom-up way.  This divide-and-conquer approach to design and testing is backed by Florentin Ipate's proof of correct integration,&lt;ref name="IpaHol97"&gt;F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (1997) 'An integration testing method that is proved to find all faults', ''International Journal of Computer Mathematics'' '''63''', pp. 159-178.&lt;/ref&gt; which proves how testing the layered machines independently is equivalent to testing the composed system.

=== Communicating X-Machine (CXM) ===
{{Redirect|CXM|the Angolan airport with that [[IATA]] code|Camaxilo Airport}}

The earliest proposal for connecting several X-machines in parallel is Judith Barnard's 1995 ''Communicating X-machine'' (''CXM'' or ''COMX'') model,&lt;ref
  name="BTWM95"&gt;J. Barnard, C. Theaker, J. Whitworth and M. Woodward (1995) 'Real-time communicating X-machines for the formal design of real-time systems', in ''Proceedings of DARTS '95, Universite Libre, Brussels, Belgium, 9–11 November 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
  name="Bar96"&gt;J. Barnard (1996)
  ''COMX: A methodology for the formal design of computer systems using Communicating X-machines''. 
  PhD Thesis, Staffordshire University.&lt;/ref&gt;
in which machines are connected via named communication channels (known as ''ports''); this model exists in both discrete- and real-timed variants.&lt;ref
  name="AldBarn97"&gt;A. Alderson and J. Barnard (1997)
  'On Making a Crossing Safe',
  ''Technical Report SOCTR/97/01'', School of Computing, Staffordshire University.
  [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/alderson97making.html (Citeseer)]
&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier versions of this work were not fully formal and did not show full input/output relations.

A similar Communicating X-Machine approach using buffered
channels was developed by Petros Kefalas.&lt;ref name="KEK00a"&gt;E. Kehris, G. Eleftherakis and P. Kefalas (2000) 'Using X-machines to model and test discrete event simulation programs', ''Proc. 4th World Multiconference on Circuits, Systems, Communications and Computers'', Athens.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KEK00b"&gt;P. Kefalas, G. Eleftherakis and E. Kehris (2000) 'Communicating X-machines: a practical approach for modular specification of large systems', ''Technical Report CS-09/00, Department of Computer Science'', City College, Thessaloniki.&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus of this work was on expressiveness in the composition of components.  The ability to reassign channels meant that some of the testing theorems from Stream X-Machines did not carry over.

These variants are discussed [[Communicating X-Machine|in more detail]] on a separate page.

=== Communicating Stream X-Machine (CSXM) ===

The first fully formal model of concurrent X-machine composition was proposed in 1999 by Cristina Vertan and Horia Georgescu,&lt;ref name="GeoVer00"&gt;H. Georgescu and C. Vertan (2000) 'A new approach to communicating stream X-machines', ''Journal of Universal Computer Science'' '''6''' ''(5)'', pp. 490-502.&lt;/ref&gt; based on earlier work on communicating automatata by Philip Bird and Anthony Cowling.&lt;ref
  name="BC94"&gt;P. R. Bird and A. J. Cowling (1994)
  'Modelling logic programming using a network of communicating machines', in
  ''Proc. 2nd Euromicro Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Processing, Malaga, 26–28 January 1994'', pp. 156-161.
  [http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~ajc/csxms/papers/euromic94.html Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Vertan's model, the machines communicate indirectly, via a shared ''communication matrix'' (essentially an array of pigeonholes), rather than directly via shared channels.

Bălănescu, Cowling, Georgescu, Vertan and others have studied the formal properties of this CSXM model in some detail.  Full input/output relations can be shown.  The ''communication matrix'' establishes a protocol for synchronous communication.  The advantage of this is that it decouples each machine's processing from their communication, allowing the separate testing of each behaviour.  This compositional model was proven equivalent to a standard [[Stream X-Machine]],&lt;ref name="BCHGGV99"&gt;T.Balanescu, A. J. Cowling, H. Georgescu, M. Gheorghe, M. Holcombe and C. Vertan (1999) 'Communicating X-machines systems are no more than X-machines', ''Journal of Universal Computer Science'', '''5''' ''(9)'', pp. 494-507.&lt;/ref&gt; so leveraging the earlier testing theory developed by Holcombe and Ipate.

This X-machine variant is discussed [[Communicating X-Machine|in more detail]] on a separate page.

=== Object X-Machine (OXM) ===

Kirill Bogdanov and Anthony Simons developed several variants of the X-machine to model the behaviour of objects in object-oriented systems.&lt;ref name="SBH01"&gt;A. J. H. Simons, K. E. Bogdanov and W. M. L. Holcombe (2001) 'Complete functional testing using object machines', ''Technical Report CS-01-18, Department of Computer Science'', University of Sheffield&lt;/ref&gt;  This model differs from the [[Stream X-Machine]] approach, in that the monolithic data type X is distributed over, and encapsulated by, several objects, which are serially composed; and systems are driven by method invocations and returns, rather than by inputs and outputs.  
Further work in this area concerned adapting the formal testing theory in the context of inheritance, which partitions the state-space of the superclass in extended subclass objects.&lt;ref name="Simo06"&gt;A. J. H. Simons (2006) 'A theory of regression testing for behaviourally compatible object types', ''Software Testing, Verification and Reliability'', '''16''' ''(3)'', John Wiley, pp. 133-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

A "CCS-augmented X-machine" (CCSXM) model was later developed by Simons and Stannett in 2002 to support complete behavioural testing of object-oriented systems, in the presence of asynchronous communication&lt;ref
  name="SS02"&gt;M. Stannett and A. J. H. Simons (2002)
  'CCS-Augmented X-Machines', 
  ''Technical Report CS-2002-04, Department of Computer Science'', Sheffield University, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is expected to bear some similarity with [[NASA]]'s recent proposal; but no definitive comparison of the two models has as yet been conducted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30555">{{DISPLAYTITLE:{{pi}}-calculus}}
In [[theoretical computer science]], the '''{{pi}}-calculus''' (or '''pi-calculus''') is a [[process calculus]]. The {{pi}}-calculus allows channel names to be communicated along the channels themselves, and in this way it is able to describe [[concurrent computation]]s whose network configuration may change during the computation.

The {{pi}}-calculus is simple, it has very few terms and so is a very small language {{crossreference|selfref=no|(see [[#Syntax]])}}, yet is very expressive. Functional programs can be encoded into the {{pi}}-calculus, and the encoding emphasises the dialogue nature of computation, drawing connections with [[game semantics]]. Extensions of the {{pi}}-calculus, such as the spi calculus and applied {{pi}}, have been successful in reasoning about [[cryptographic protocol]]s. Beside the original use in describing concurrent systems, the {{pi}}-calculus has also been used to reason about [[business process]]es&lt;ref name="omg"&gt;OMG Specification (2011). [http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0 "Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) Version 2.0"], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Management_Group ''Object Management Group'']. p.21&lt;/ref&gt; and [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref name="reeve" /&gt;

== Informal definition ==
The {{pi}}-calculus belongs to the family of [[process calculi]], mathematical formalisms for describing and analyzing properties of concurrent computation. In fact, the {{pi}}-calculus, like the [[lambda calculus|λ-calculus]], is so minimal that it does not contain primitives such as numbers, booleans, data structures, variables, functions, or even the usual control flow statements (such as &lt;code&gt;if-then-else&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;).

=== Process constructs ===

Central to the {{pi}}-calculus is the notion of ''name''. The simplicity of the calculus lies in the dual role that names play as ''communication channels'' and ''variables''.

The process constructs available in the calculus are the following&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/jeannette-wing/pi.pdf|title=FAQ on π-Calculus|last=Wing|first=Jeannette M.|date=27 December 2002|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a precise definition is given in the following section):

* ''concurrency'', written &lt;math&gt;P \mid Q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are two processes or threads executed concurrently.
* ''communication'', where
** ''input prefixing'' &lt;math&gt;c\left(x\right).P&lt;/math&gt; is a process waiting for a message that was sent on a communication channel named &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; before proceeding as {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;,}} binding the name received to the name {{nowrap|{{mvar|x}}.}} Typically, this models either a process expecting a communication from the network or a label &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; usable only once by a &lt;code&gt;goto c&lt;/code&gt; operation.
** ''output prefixing''  &lt;math&gt;\overline{c} \langle y \rangle.P&lt;/math&gt; describes that the name &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is emitted on channel &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; before proceeding as {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.}} Typically, this models either sending a message on the network or a &lt;code&gt;goto c&lt;/code&gt; operation.
* ''replication'', written &lt;math&gt;!\,P&lt;/math&gt;, which may be seen as a process which can always create a new copy of {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.}} Typically, this models either a network service or a label &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; waiting for any number of &lt;code&gt;goto c&lt;/code&gt; operations.
* ''creation of a new name'', written &lt;math&gt;\left(\nu x\right)P&lt;/math&gt;, which may be seen as a process allocating a new constant {{mvar|x}} within {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.}} The constants of {{nowrap|{{pi}}-calculus}} are defined by their names only and are always communication channels. Creation of a new name in a process is also called ''restriction''.
* the nil process, written &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, is a process whose execution is complete and has stopped.

Although the minimalism of the {{pi}}-calculus prevents us from writing programs in the normal sense, it is easy to extend the calculus. In particular, it is easy to define both control structures such as recursion, loops and sequential composition and datatypes such as first-order functions, [[truth value]]s, lists and integers. Moreover, extensions of the {{nowrap|{{pi}}-calculus}} have been proposed which take into account distribution or public-key cryptography. The ''applied {{nowrap|{{pi}}-calculus}}'' due to Abadi and Fournet [http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/~abadi/Papers/isss02.pdf] put these various extensions on a formal footing by extending the {{nowrap|{{pi}}-calculus}} with arbitrary datatypes.

=== A small example ===

Below is a tiny example of a process which consists of three parallel components. The channel name {{mvar|x}} is only known by the first two components.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

    &amp;  \begin{align}
                (\nu x) \; &amp; ( \; \overline{x} \langle z \rangle . \; 0 \\
                           &amp; | \; x(y). \; \overline{y}\langle x \rangle . \; x(y). \; 0 \; )
        \end{align} \\
| \; &amp; z(v) . \; \overline{v}\langle v \rangle . 0

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first two components are able to communicate on the channel {{mvar|x}}, and the name &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; becomes bound to &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. The next step in the process is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

  &amp; \begin{align}
      ( \nu x) \; ( \; &amp; 0 \\
                  | \; &amp; \overline{z} \langle x \rangle . \; x(y). \; 0 \; )
    \end{align}

  \\

| \; &amp; z(v). \; \overline{v}\langle v \rangle . \; 0

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the remaining &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not affected because it is defined in an inner scope.
The second and third parallel components can now communicate on the channel name &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, and the name &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; becomes bound to {{mvar|x}}. The next step in the process is now

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

 (\nu x)        ( \; &amp; 0 \\
                | \; &amp; x(y). \; 0  \\
                | \; &amp; \overline{x}\langle x \rangle . \; 0 \; )

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that since the local name {{mvar|x}} has been output, the scope of {{mvar|x}} is extended to cover the third component as well. Finally, the channel {{mvar|x}} can be used for sending the name {{mvar|x}}. After that all concurrently executing processes have stopped

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

 (\nu x)        ( \; &amp; 0 \\
                | \; 0  \\
                | \; 0 \; )

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Formal definition ==

=== Syntax ===

Let Χ be a set of objects called ''names''. The [[abstract syntax]] for the {{pi}}-calculus is built from the following [[BNF grammar]] (where ''x'' and ''y'' are any names from Χ):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfcs.inf.ed.ac.uk/reports/89/ECS-LFCS-89-85/ A Calculus of Mobile Processes part 1] page 10, by R. Milner, J. Parrow and D. Walker published in Information and Computation 100(1) pp.1-40, Sept 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P, Q, R ::= \, &amp; x(y).P \,\,\, \, \, &amp; \text{Receive on channel }x\text{, bind the result to }y\text{, then run }P \\
|\,\,\, &amp; \overline{x} \langle y \rangle.P \,\,\, \, \, &amp;\text{Send the value }y\text{ over channel }x\text{, then run }P \\
|\,\,\, &amp; P|Q \,\,\, \, \, \, \, \, \, &amp;\text{Run }P\text{ and }Q\text{ simultaneously} \\
|\,\,\, &amp; (\nu x)P  \,\,\, &amp;\text{Create a new channel }x\text{ and run }P \\
|\,\,\, &amp; !P \,\,\, &amp;\text{Repeatedly spawn copies of }P \\
|\,\,\, &amp; 0 &amp; \text{Terminate the process}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the concrete syntax below, the prefixes bind more tightly than the parallel composition (|), and parentheses are used to disambiguate.

Names are bound by the restriction and input prefix constructs. Formally, the set of free names of a process in {{pi}}–calculus are defined inductively by the table below. The set of bound names of a process are defined as the names of a process that are not in the set of free names.
{| class="wikitable" style="width: 100%;"
! Construct
! Free names
|-
| &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
| None
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\overline{a} \langle x \rangle.P&lt;/math&gt;
| ''a''; ''x''; all free names of ''P''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;a(x).P&lt;/math&gt;
| ''a''; free names of ''P'' except for ''x''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;P|Q&lt;/math&gt;
| All free names of ''P'' and ''Q''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;(\nu x).P&lt;/math&gt;
| Free names of ''P'' except for ''x''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;!P&lt;/math&gt;
| All free names of ''P''
|}

=== Structural congruence ===

Central to both the reduction semantics and the labelled transition semantics is the notion of '''structural congruence'''. Two processes are structurally congruent, if they are identical up to structure. In particular, parallel composition is commutative and associative.

More precisely, structural congruence is defined as the least equivalence relation preserved by the process constructs and satisfying:

''Alpha-conversion'':

:* &lt;math&gt;P \equiv Q&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by renaming one or more bound names in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

''Axioms for parallel composition'':

:* &lt;math&gt;P|Q \equiv Q|P&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt;(P|Q)|R \equiv P|(Q|R)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;P | 0 \equiv P&lt;/math&gt;

''Axioms for restriction'':

:* &lt;math&gt;(\nu x)(\nu y)P \equiv (\nu y)(\nu x)P&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt;(\nu x)0 \equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;

''Axiom for replication'':

:* &lt;math&gt;!P \equiv P|!P&lt;/math&gt;

''Axiom relating restriction and parallel'':

:* &lt;math&gt;(\nu x)(P | Q) \equiv (\nu x)P | Q &lt;/math&gt; if {{mvar|x}} is not a free name of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.

This last axiom is known as the "scope extension" axiom. This axiom is central, since it describes how a bound name {{mvar|x}} may be extruded by an output action, causing the scope of {{mvar|x}} to be extended. In cases where {{mvar|x}} is a free name of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, alpha-conversion may be used to allow extension to proceed.

=== Reduction semantics ===

We write &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow P'&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can perform a computation step, following which it is now &lt;math&gt;P'&lt;/math&gt;.
This ''reduction relation'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the least relation closed under a set of reduction rules.

The main reduction rule which captures the ability of processes to communicate through channels is the following:
* &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}\langle z \rangle.P | x(y).Q \rightarrow P | Q[z/y] &lt;/math&gt;
: where &lt;math&gt;Q[z/y]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the process &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; in which the free name &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; has been ''substituted'' for the free occurrences of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. If a free occurrence of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; occurs in a location where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; would not be free, alpha-conversion may be required.

There are three additional rules:
* If &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; then also &lt;math&gt;P|R \rightarrow Q|R&lt;/math&gt;.
: This rule says that parallel composition does not inhibit computation.
* If &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;, then also &lt;math&gt;(\nu x)P \rightarrow (\nu x)Q&lt;/math&gt;.
: This rule ensures that computation can proceed underneath a restriction.
* If &lt;math&gt;P \equiv P'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P' \rightarrow Q'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q' \equiv Q&lt;/math&gt;, then also &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;.

The latter rule states that processes that are structurally congruent have the same reductions.

=== The example revisited ===

Consider again the process

:&lt;math&gt; (\nu x)(\overline{x} \langle z \rangle.0  |  x(y).   \overline{y}\langle x \rangle . x(y).0 ) | z(v) . \overline{v}\langle v \rangle. 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Applying the definition of the reduction semantics, we get the reduction

:&lt;math&gt; (\nu x)(\overline{x} \langle z \rangle.0  |  x(y).   \overline{y}\langle x \rangle . x(y).0 ) | z(v) . \overline{v}\langle v \rangle. 0  \rightarrow (\nu x)(0|  \overline{z}\langle x \rangle . x(y). 0 ) | z(v). \overline{v}\langle v \rangle .0 &lt;/math&gt;

Note how, applying the reduction substitution axiom, free occurrences of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are now labeled as &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.

Next, we get the reduction

:&lt;math&gt; (\nu x)(0|  \overline{z}\langle x \rangle . x(y). 0 ) | z(v). \overline{v}\langle v \rangle .0 \rightarrow (\nu x)(0|  x(y). 0  | \overline{x}\langle x \rangle .0)  &lt;/math&gt;

Note that since the local name {{mvar|x}} has been output, the scope of {{mvar|x}} is extended to cover the third component as well.  This was captured using the scope extension axiom.

Next, using the reduction substitution axiom, we get

:&lt;math&gt; (\nu x)(0 | 0 | 0) &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, using the axioms for parallel composition and restriction, we get

:&lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Labelled semantics ===

Alternatively, one may give the pi-calculus a labelled transition semantics (as has been done with the [[Calculus of Communicating Systems]]). Transitions in this semantics are of the form:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
P\,\xrightarrow{\overset{}\alpha} P'
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
This [[State transition system|notation]] signifies that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; after the action &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;P'&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can be an ''input action'' &lt;math&gt;a(x)&lt;/math&gt;, an ''output action'' ''&lt;math&gt;\overline{a}\langle x \rangle&lt;/math&gt;'', or a tau-action {{mvar|&amp;tau;}} corresponding to an internal communication.

A standard result about the labelled semantics is that it agrees with the reduction semantics in the sense that 
&lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow P'&lt;/math&gt; if and only if 
&lt;math&gt;P\,\xrightarrow{\overset{}\tau} P'&lt;/math&gt; for some action &amp;tau;.

== Extensions and variants ==

The syntax given above is a minimal one. However, the syntax may be modified in various ways.

A ''nondeterministic choice operator'' &lt;math&gt;P + Q&lt;/math&gt; can be added to the syntax.

A test for ''name equality'' &lt;math&gt;[x=y]P&lt;/math&gt; can be added to the syntax. This ''match operator'' can proceed as &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if {{mvar|x}} and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are the same name.
Similarly, one may add a ''mismatch operator'' for '''name inequality'''. Practical programs which can pass names (URLs or pointers) often use such functionality: for directly modelling such functionality inside the calculus, this and related extensions are often useful.

The ''asynchronous {{pi}}-calculus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boudol|first1=G.|title=Asynchrony and the {{pi}}-calculus. Techical Report 1702, INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis| date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Honda |first1=K. | last2=Tokoro | first2=M. |title=An Object Calculus for Asynchronous Communication. ECOOP 91|publisher=Springer Verlag| date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
allows only outputs with no suffix, i.e. output atoms of the form &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}\langle y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, yielding a smaller calculus. However, any process in the original calculus can be represented by the smaller asynchronous {{pi}}-calculus using an extra channel to simulate explicit acknowledgement from the receiving process. Since a continuation-free output can model a message-in-transit, this fragment shows that the original {{pi}}-calculus, which is intuitively based on synchronous communication, has an expressive asynchronous communication model inside its syntax. However, the nondeterministic choice operator defined above cannot be expressed in this way, as an [[guard (computer science)|unguarded]] choice would be converted into a guarded one; this fact has been used to demonstrate that the asynchronous calculus is strictly less expressive than the synchronous one (with the choice operator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palamidessi|first=Catuscia|title=Comparing the expressive power of the Synchronous and the Asynchronous pi-calculus|journal=Proceedings of the 24th ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages|year=1997|pages=256–265|arxiv=cs/9809008|accessdate=|bibcode=1998cs........9008P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''polyadic {{pi}}-calculus'' allows communicating more than one name in a single action: &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}\langle z_1,...,z_n\rangle.P&lt;/math&gt; ''(polyadic output)'' and &lt;math&gt;x(z_1,...,z_n).P&lt;/math&gt; ''(polyadic input)''. This polyadic extension, which is useful especially when studying types for name passing processes,  can be encoded in the monadic calculus by passing the name of a private channel through which the multiple arguments are then passed in sequence. The encoding is defined recursively by the clauses

&lt;math&gt;\overline{x}\langle y_1,\cdots,y_n\rangle.P&lt;/math&gt; is encoded as &lt;math&gt;(\nu w) \overline{x}\langle w \rangle.\overline{w}\langle y_1\rangle.\cdots.\overline{w}\langle y_n\rangle.[P]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x(y_1,\cdots,y_n).P&lt;/math&gt; is encoded as &lt;math&gt;x(w).w(y_1).\cdots.w(y_n).[P]&lt;/math&gt;

All other process constructs are left unchanged by the encoding.

In the above, &lt;math&gt;[P]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the encoding of all prefixes in the continuation &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in the same way.

The full power of replication &lt;math&gt;!P&lt;/math&gt; is not needed. Often, one only considers ''replicated input'' &lt;math&gt;! x(y).P&lt;/math&gt;, whose structural congruence axiom is &lt;math&gt;! x(y).P \equiv x(y).P | !x(y).P&lt;/math&gt;.

Replicated input process such as &lt;math&gt; !x(y).P&lt;/math&gt; can be understood as servers, waiting on channel
{{mvar|x}} to be invoked by clients. Invocation of a server spawns a new copy of
the process &lt;math&gt;P[a/y]&lt;/math&gt;, where a is the name passed by the client to the
server, during the latter's invocation.

A ''higher order {{pi}}-calculus'' can be defined where not only names but processes are sent through channels.
The key reduction rule for the higher order case is

&lt;math&gt;\overline{x}\langle R \rangle.P | x(Y).Q \rightarrow P | Q[R/Y] &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; denotes a ''process variable'' which can be instantiated by a process term. Sangiorgi
established that the ability to pass processes does not
increase the expressivity of the {{pi}}-calculus: passing a process ''P'' can be
simulated by just passing a name that points to ''P'' instead.

== Properties ==

=== Turing completeness ===

The {{pi}}-calculus is a [[Turing complete|universal model of computation]]. This was first observed by Milner in his paper "Functions as Processes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milner|first=Robin|title=Functions as Processes|journal=Mathematical Structures in Computer Science|pages=119–141|year=1992|volume=2|doi=10.1017/s0960129500001407|url=http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/07/54/05/PDF/RR-1154.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he presents two encodings of the [[lambda-calculus]] in the {{pi}}-calculus. One encoding simulates the eager (call-by-value) [[evaluation strategy]], the other encoding simulates the normal-order (call-by-name) strategy. In both of these, the crucial insight is the modeling of environment bindings – for instance, "{{mvar|x}} is bound to term &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;" – as replicating agents that respond to requests for their bindings by sending back a connection to the term &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

The features of the {{pi}}-calculus that make these encodings possible are name-passing and replication (or, equivalently, recursively defined agents). In the absence of replication/recursion, the {{pi}}-calculus ceases to be [[Turing]]-powerful. This can be seen by the fact that [[bisimulation]] equivalence becomes decidable for the recursion-free calculus and even for the finite-control {{pi}}-calculus where the number of parallel components in any process is bounded by a constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dam|first=Mads|title=On the Decidability of Process Equivalences for the pi-Calculus|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|issue=183|pages=215–228|year=1997|volume=183|doi=10.1016/S0304-3975(96)00325-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bisimulations in the {{pi}}-calculus ==

{{See also|Bisimulation}}

As for process calculi, the {{pi}}-calculus allows for a definition of bisimulation equivalence. In the {{pi}}-calculus, the definition of bisimulation equivalence (also known as bisimilarity) may be based on either the reduction semantics or on the labelled transition semantics.

There are (at least) three different ways of defining ''labelled bisimulation equivalence'' in the {{pi}}-calculus: Early, late and open bisimilarity. This stems from the fact that the {{pi}}-calculus is a value-passing process calculus.

In the remainder of this section, we let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; denote processes and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; denote binary relations over processes.

=== Early and late bisimilarity ===

Early and late bisimilarity were both formulated by Milner, Parrow and Walker in their original paper on the {{pi}}-calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milner|first=R.|author2=J. Parrow |author3= D. Walker|title=A calculus of mobile processes|journal=Information and Computation|issue=1|pages=1–40|year=1992|doi=10.1016/0890-5401(92)90008-4|volume=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A binary relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; over processes is an ''early bisimulation'' if for every pair of processes &lt;math&gt;(p, q) \in R&lt;/math&gt;,
* whenever &lt;math&gt;
p \,\xrightarrow{a(x)}\,p'
&lt;/math&gt; then for every name &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; there exists some &lt;math&gt;q'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;
q \,\xrightarrow{a(x)}\,q'
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(p'[y/x],q'[y/x]) \in R&lt;/math&gt;;
* for any non-input action &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;{
p \xrightarrow{\overset{}{\alpha}}  p'
}  &lt;/math&gt; then there exists some &lt;math&gt;q'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;
q \xrightarrow{\overset{}{\alpha}} q'
  &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(p',q') \in R&lt;/math&gt;;
* and symmetric requirements with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; interchanged.

Processes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are said to be early bisimilar, written &lt;math&gt;p \sim_e q&lt;/math&gt; if the pair &lt;math&gt;(p,q) \in R&lt;/math&gt; for some early bisimulation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

In late bisimilarity, the transition match must be independent of the name being transmitted.
A binary relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; over processes is a ''late bisimulation'' if for every pair of processes &lt;math&gt;(p, q) \in R&lt;/math&gt;,
* whenever &lt;math&gt;
p \xrightarrow{a(x)}  p'
&lt;/math&gt; then for some &lt;math&gt;q'&lt;/math&gt; it holds that &lt;math&gt;
q \xrightarrow{a(x)} q'
&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(p'[y/x],q'[y/x]) \in R&lt;/math&gt; ''for every name y'';
*for any non-input action &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;
p \xrightarrow{\overset{}{\alpha}} p'
  &lt;/math&gt; implies that there exists some &lt;math&gt;q'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;
q \xrightarrow{\overset{}{\alpha}} q'
  &lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;(p',q') \in R&lt;/math&gt;;
* and symmetric requirements with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; interchanged.
Processes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are said to be late bisimilar, written &lt;math&gt;p \sim_l q&lt;/math&gt; if the pair &lt;math&gt;(p,q) \in R&lt;/math&gt; for some late bisimulation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

Both &lt;math&gt;\sim_e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sim_l&lt;/math&gt; suffer from the problem that they are not ''congruence relations'' in the sense that they are not preserved by all process constructs. More precisely, there exist processes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p \sim_e q&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;a(x).p \not \sim_e a(x).q&lt;/math&gt;. One may remedy this problem by considering the maximal congruence relations included in &lt;math&gt;\sim_e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sim_l&lt;/math&gt;, known as ''early congruence'' and ''late congruence'', respectively.

=== Open bisimilarity ===

Fortunately, a third definition is possible, which avoids this problem, namely that of ''open bisimilarity'', due to Sangiorgi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sangiorgi|first=D.|title=A theory of bisimulation for the π-calculus|journal=Acta Informatica|volume=33|pages=69–97|year=1996|doi=10.1007/s002360050036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A binary relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; over processes is an ''open bisimulation'' if for every pair of elements &lt;math&gt;(p, q) \in R&lt;/math&gt; and for every name substitution &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and every action &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt;
p\sigma \xrightarrow{\overset{}{\alpha}}  p'&lt;/math&gt; then there exists some &lt;math&gt;q'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;
q\sigma  \xrightarrow{\overset{}{\alpha}} q'
  &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(p',q') \in R&lt;/math&gt;.

Processes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are said to be open bisimilar, written &lt;math&gt;p \sim_o q&lt;/math&gt; if the pair &lt;math&gt;(p,q) \in R&lt;/math&gt; for some open bisimulation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Early, late and open bisimilarity are distinct ====

Early, late and open bisimilarity are distinct. The containments are proper, so &lt;math&gt;\sim_o \subsetneq \sim_l \subsetneq \sim_e&lt;/math&gt;.

In certain subcalculi such as the asynchronous pi-calculus, late, early and open bisimilarity are known to coincide. However, in this setting a more appropriate notion is that of ''asynchronous bisimilarity''.

The reader should note that, in the literature, the term ''open bisimulation'' usually refers to a more sophisticated notion, where processes and relations are indexed by distinction relations; details are in Sangiorgi's paper cited above.

=== Barbed equivalence ===

Alternatively, one may define bisimulation equivalence directly from the reduction semantics. We write &lt;math&gt;p \Downarrow a&lt;/math&gt; if process &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; immediately allows an input or an output on name &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

A binary relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; over processes is a ''barbed bisimulation'' if it is a symmetric relation which satisfies that for every pair of elements &lt;math&gt;(p, q) \in R&lt;/math&gt; we have that

:(1) &lt;math&gt;p \Downarrow a&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;q \Downarrow a&lt;/math&gt; for every name &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;

and

:(2) for every reduction &lt;math&gt; p \rightarrow p'&lt;/math&gt; there exists a reduction &lt;math&gt; q \rightarrow  q' &lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;(p',q') \in R&lt;/math&gt;.

We say that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; are ''barbed bisimilar'' if there exists a barbed bisimulation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;(p,q) \in R&lt;/math&gt;.

Defining a context as a {{pi}} term with a hole [] we say that two processes P and Q are ''barbed congruent'', written &lt;math&gt;P \sim_b Q\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, if for every context &lt;math&gt;C[] &lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt;C[P]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C[Q]&lt;/math&gt; are barbed bisimilar. It turns out that barbed congruence coincides with the congruence induced by early bisimilarity.

== Applications ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[SPI]] --&gt;

The {{pi}}-calculus has been used to describe many different kinds of concurrent systems. In fact, some of the most recent applications lie outside the realm of traditional computer science.

In 1997, [[Martin Abadi]] and Andrew Gordon proposed an extension of the {{pi}}-calculus, the [[Spi-calculus]], as a formal notation for describing and reasoning about cryptographic protocols. The spi-calculus extends the {{pi}}-calculus with primitives for encryption and decryption. In 2001, [[Martin Abadi]] and Cedric Fournet generalised the handling of cryptographic protocols to produce the applied {{pi}} calculus. There is now a large body of work devoted to variants of the applied {{pi}} calculus, including a number of experimental verification tools. One example is the tool [[ProVerif]] [http://www.proverif.ens.fr/] due to [[Bruno Blanchet]], based on a translation of the applied {{pi}}-calculus into Blanchet's logic programming framework. Another example is Cryptyc [http://www.cryptyc.org], due to Andrew Gordon and Alan Jeffrey, which uses Woo and Lam's method of correspondence assertions as the basis for type systems that can check for authentication properties of cryptographic protocols.

Around 2002, Howard Smith and [[Peter Fingar]] became interested that {{pi}}-calculus would become a description tool for modelling business processes. By July 2006, there is discussion in the community about how useful this would be. Most recently, the {{pi}}-calculus has formed the theoretical basis of [[Business Process Modeling Language]] (BPML), and of Microsoft's XLANG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpmi.org/downloads/BPML-BPEL4WS.pdf "BPML | BPEL4WS: A Convergence Path toward a Standard BPM Stack."] BPMI.org Position Paper. August 15, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{pi}}-calculus has also attracted interest in molecular biology. In 1999, [[Aviv Regev]] and [[Ehud Shapiro]] showed that one can describe a cellular signaling pathway (the so-called [[Receptor tyrosine kinase|RTK]]/[[MAPK]] cascade)  and in particular the molecular "lego" which implements these tasks of communication in an extension of the {{pi}}-calculus.&lt;ref name="reeve"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Aviv|last=Regev|authorlink=Aviv Regev|author2=William Silverman |author3= Ehud Y. Shapiro|year=2001|title=Representation and Simulation of Biochemical Processes Using the pi-Calculus Process Algebra|journal=[[Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing]]|pages=459–470}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this seminal paper, other authors described the whole metabolic network of a minimal cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Davide|last=Chiarugi|author2=Pierpaolo Degano |author3= Roberto Marangoni|year=2007|title=A computational approach to the functional screening of genomes|journal=[[PLOS Computational Biology]]|pages=1801–1806|url=http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.0030174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The {{pi}}-calculus was originally developed by [[Robin Milner]], Joachim Parrow and [[David Walker (computer scientist)|David Walker]] in 1992, based on ideas by Uffe Engberg and Mogens Nielsen. It can be seen as a continuation of Milner's work on the process calculus CCS ([[Calculus of Communicating Systems]]).  In his Turing lecture, Milner describes the development of the {{pi}}-calculus as an attempt to capture the uniformity of values and processes in actors.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Milner. 1993. Elements of interaction: Turing award lecture. Commun. ACM 36, 1 (January 1993), 78-89. DOI=10.1145/151233.151240 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/151233.151240&lt;/ref&gt;
