      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13361">[[File:Le bon conseil.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The good advice'' (original title: ''Le bon conseil''), by [[Jean-Baptiste Madou]].]]
'''Advice''' (also called '''exhortation''') is a form of relating personal or institutional [[opinion]]s, [[belief systems]], values, recommendations or guidance about certain situations relayed in some context to another person, group or party often offered as a guide to action and/or conduct. Put a little more simply, an advice message is a recommendation about what might be thought, said, or otherwise done to address a problem, make a decision, or manage a situation.

==Kinds of advice==
Advice is believed to be theoretical, and is often considered [[taboo]] as well as helpful. The kinds of advice can range from systems of [[Education|instructional]] and practical toward more [[esoteric]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]], and is often attributable toward problem solving, strategy seeking, and solution finding, either from a social standpoint or a personal one. Advice may pertain to [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], lifestyle changes, legal choices, business goals, personal goals, career goals, [[education]] goals, [[religious]] beliefs, personal growth, [[motivation]], inspiration and so on. Advice is not pertinent to any solid criteria, and may be given freely, or only given when asked upon. In some cultures advice is socially unacceptable to be released unless requested. In other cultures advice is given more openly. It may, especially if it is expert advice such as legal advice or methodological advice also be given only in exchange for payment.

Many expressions and quotations have been used to describe the status of advice, whether given, or received. One such expression is "Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didn't." ([[Erica Jong]], How to Save Your Own Life, 1977). Advice is like water, you drink it to replenish your soul. This particular quotation pertains the belief system that states that the answers to one's questions are within themselves, and do not come from any external stimuli. The accuracy of this particular belief is often disputed among theologians, philosophers, etc. However, a person who would hold such a belief, would "advise" another person to seek the answers out from within one's own esoteric and inner spiritual natures.

Advice when adhered to and followed may be beneficial, non-beneficial, damaging, non-damaging, partially beneficial and partially damaging, in reference to personal or social paradigms. In other words, not all advice is either "all good" or "all bad". Many people consider unrequested advice to be paternalistic and patronizing and are thus offended.

Therefore, some people may come to the conclusion that advice is morally better to be left out of the equation altogether, and this theory is included within the following quote (author unknown): "The best advice is this: Don't take advice and don't give advice." Yet, often in society advice has been helpful. A more day to day example would be "eat your vegetables" or "don't drink and drive." If this advice is adhered to we can see that the benefits would outweigh the consequences.

Grammatically speaking, advice is an uncountable noun, like rice or milk. Clicheing or using a cliche, refers to mainstream advice that is overused.&lt;ref&gt;Constant, David, Lee Sproull, and Sara Kiesler. "The kindness of strangers: The usefulness of electronic weak ties for technical advice." Organization science 7.2 (1996): 119-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advice-giving and advice-taking in the social sciences==

===Background information===

Advice-taking and advice-giving are of interest to researchers in the disciplines of [[psychology]], [[economics]], judgment and [[decision-making]], [[organizational behavior]] and [[human resources]], and [[human communication]], among others.&lt;ref name="organizational2006"&gt;Bonaccio, S., &amp; Dalal, R. S.  (2006). Advice taking and decision-making: An integrative literature review, and implications for the organizational sciences. ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 101,'' 127-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychology, seminal articles include Brehmer and Hagafors (1986), Hollenbeck et al. (1995), and Sniezek and Buckley (1995).&lt;ref&gt;Brehmer, B., &amp; Hagafors, R. (1986). The use of experts in complex decision-making: a paradigm for the study of staff work. ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 38,'' 181–195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hollenbeck, J. R., Ilgen, D. R., Sego, D. J., Hedlund, J., Major, D. A., &amp; Phillips, J. (1995). Multilevel theory of team decision making: decision performance in teams incorporating distributed expertise. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 80,'' 292–316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sniezek, J. A., &amp; Buckley, T. (1995). Cueing and cognitive conflict in judge–advisor decision making. ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 62,'' 159–174.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sniezek and Buckley (1995) and Hollenbeck et al. (1995) articles, in particular, introduced researchers to standardized ways of studying advice in the [[laboratory]].&lt;ref name="organizational2006"/&gt; The psychological literature on advice-giving and advice-taking was [[Literature review|reviewed]] by Bonaccio and Dalal (2006), and a portion of this literature was also reviewed by Humphrey et al. (2002).&lt;ref name="organizational2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, S. E., Hollenbeck, J. R., Meyer, C. J., &amp; Ilgen, D. R.(2002). Hierarchical team decision making. In G. R. Ferris &amp; J. J. Martocchio (Eds.). ''Research in personnel and human resources management'' (Vol. 21, pp. 175–213). Stamford, CT: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication researchers have tended to study advice as part of their research on supportive communication.&lt;ref&gt;Burleson, B. R., &amp; MacGeorge, E. L. (2002). Supportive communication. In M. L. Knapp &amp; J. A. Daly (Eds.), ''Handbook of interpersonal communication'' (3rd ed., pp. 374-424). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacGeorge, E. L., Feng, B., &amp; Thompson, E. R. (2008). "Good" and "bad" advice: How to advise more effectively. In M. T. Motley (Ed.), ''Studies in applied interpersonal communication'' (pp. 145-164). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Much research has focused on [[Sex differences in humans|gender differences]] (and similarities) in the provision and receipt of supportive communication.&lt;ref&gt;MacGeorge, E. L., Graves, A. R., Feng, B., Gillihan, S. J., &amp; Burleson, B. R. (2004). The myth of gender cultures: Similarities outweigh differences in men’s and women’s provision of and responses to supportive communication. ''Sex Roles, 50,'' 144-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

In economics, the willingness of entrepreneurs to take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e., entrepreneurial ''coachability'') has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timmons|first=Jeffry A.|last2=Bygrave|first2=William D.|date=1986-03-01|title=Venture capital's role in financing innovation for economic growth|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0883902686900121|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=1|issue=2|pages=161–176|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(86)90012-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, some economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because the entrepreneurs themselves possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of advice-taking are ''not'' actually predictive of subsequent entrepreneurial success (e.g., measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots, and firm survival).

===Social science definitions of "advice"===

In the social sciences in general, and in psychological research in particular, advice has typically been defined as a recommendation to do something.&lt;ref name="organizational2006"/&gt; For example, in response to a client's question regarding whether to invest in stocks, bonds, or T-notes, a financial planner (the advisor) might say: "I recommend going with bonds at this time." However, Dalal and Bonaccio (2010) have argued, based on a review of the research literature, that such a definition is incomplete and leaves out several important types of advice&lt;ref name="organizational1"&gt;Dalal, R. S., &amp; Bonaccio, S. (2010). What types of advice do decision-makers prefer? ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 112,'' 11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sapients.net/article/howtogiveafriendadvice/ |title=Difficult Times – How to give a friend Advice |publisher=Sapients.net |date=2011-07-25 |accessdate=2012-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321200947/http://www.sapients.net/article/howtogiveafriendadvice/ |archivedate=2012-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors have provided the following taxonomy of advice:
* Recommending a particular course of action (this is the usual form of advice that is studied)
* Recommending ''against'' a particular course of action
* Providing additional information about a particular course of action without explicitly prescribing or proscribing that course of action
* Recommending ''how'' to go about making the decision (here, too, no courses of action are explicitly prescribed or proscribed)
Of these four types of advice (and [[Social support|socio-emotional support]], which is a related form of interpersonal assistance that often accompanies advice), Dalal and Bonaccio (2010) found that decision-makers reacted most favorably to the provision of information, because this form of advice not only increased decision [[accuracy]] but also allowed the decision-maker to maintain [[autonomy]].&lt;ref name="organizational1"/&gt;

==Methodological advice==

Methodological advice concerns expert advice on [[research methodology]]. This kind of advice is, as opposed to some forms of advising mentioned above, usually initiated by the person who receives the advice, thus not unrequested. The goal of the advisor (see [[statistical consultant]]) is to guarantee the quality of research undertaken by his client, a [[researcher]], by providing sound methodological advice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adèr, H. J.]], [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|Mellenbergh G. J.]], &amp; Hand, D. J. (2008). ''Advising on research methods: A consultants companion.'' Huizen, The Netherlands: Johannes van Kessel Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The advice may take different forms. In some cases the advisor collaborates with a researcher in a more long-term process, and guides him through the more technical parts of the research (this type of advising is called longitudinal consultancy). In complex, longterm projects it is not uncommon for the advisor to help by doing part of the work him or herself (interactive consultancy). In other cases a researcher may have a specific question that can be answered in a brief conversation with a consultant (cross-sectional consultancy, or advisory consulting).&lt;ref&gt;Van Belle, G. (2008). ''Statistical rules of thumb (2nd ed.).'' New York: Wiley: Chapter 10 (pp. 217-235).&lt;/ref&gt; The advisors role can also take a didactic form, when the client is not familiar with suggested (statistical) methods. Sometimes the best advice is not statistically ideal, but is comprehensible for the client.

Depending on the function of the methodological advisor, the advice that is given may not be free. If a student conducts research commissioned by a professor, this professor will probably help this student for free, if needed. However, if a researcher contacts an independent advisor, this probably costs him/her. In this case the methodological advisor is basically being hired by the researcher. In other cases the advisor may be incorporated into research team, leading to co-authorship. It is advisable to make clear agreements about the advisors compensation on fore hand.

Researchers may seek advice on a wide range of subjects concerning their research. One of the major tasks of the methodological advisor is to help his clients think about what they really want to accomplish. This may involve helping them to (re)formulate the [[research question]] and relatedly, the research hypothesis (see [[scientific hypothesis]]). Clients may also seek advice on the construction of a measurement instrument (for instance a [[psychological test]]). Or, they may want to know how to implement an appropriate [[research design]]. Often questions arise on how to analyze the data (see [[data analysis]]), and how to interpret and report the results (see [[scientific publishing]]).

A researcher will usually know more about the field in which the study is conducted than the methodological advisor. The advisor on the other hand will know more about the method. By combining their expertise and, through dialog and cooperation, researcher and consultant may achieve better, more reliable results.&lt;ref&gt;Derr, J. (2008). Having an impact in a multi-disciplinary setting. In [[H. J. Adèr]] &amp; [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|G. J. Mellenbergh]] (Eds.), ''Proceedings of the 2007 KNAW colloquium Advising on research methods'': pp. 11-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beneficium inventarii''''' (literally '''benefit of the inventory''') is a [[legal doctrine]] introduced into [[Roman law]] by [[Justinian I]] to limit the [[legal liability|liability]] of [[Beneficiary|heirs]] resulting from an [[Insolvency|insolvent]] [[Estate (law)|estate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/b/beneficium-inventarii/ Definition at USLegal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine, which is in force today in many [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law systems]], applies to both [[Will (law)|wills]] and [[Intestacy|intestate]] successions. An heir may accept a succession under ''beneficium inventarii'' without being liable for the debts attaching to the estate or to the claims of [[Will (law)|legatees]] beyond the estate's value as previously determined by inventory.

'''Body image law''' is the  developing area of law that,  according to Dr Marilyn Bromberg of the [[University of Western Australia]] Law School and Cindy Halliwell, a law student at [[Deakin University]], "encompasses the bills, laws and government actions (such as establishing parliamentary inquiries and creating policies) that may help to improve the [[body image]] of the general public, and particularly of young people".&lt;ref name="mb/ch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bromberg|first1=Marilyn|last2=Halliwell|first2=Cindy|title=All About That Bass’ and Photoshopping a Model’s Waist: Introducing Body Image Law|journal=The University of Notre Dame Australia Law Review|date=2016|volume=18|url=http://researchonline.nd.edu.au/undalr/vol18/iss1/1/|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons for implementing law in this area is to prevent the images of unhealthily thin women causing poor body image which can, along with other factors, lead to an [[eating disorder]].&lt;ref name="mb/ch" /&gt;

== Laws ==
The [[Israeli system of government|Israeli government]] passed a body image law in 2012 which became operational the following year. The law requires models to have a minimum [[body mass index]] to work and if an image was photoshopped to make the model appear thinner, it must have a warning. The warning must state that the image was modified and it must take up at least seven percent of the image. Breaches can result in a civil lawsuit.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel: Restrictions on Depiction of Underweight Models in Commercials|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/israel-restrictions-on-depiction-of-underweight-models-in-commercials/|website=www.loc.gov|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en|date=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[French Government]]  passed a similar law in 2015 which came into effect in 2017. This law requires that models provide their employers with a "medical certificate, valid for up to two years, confirming their general physical well-being and the fact that they are not excessively underweight." &lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/fashion/france-laws-thin-models.html|title=A New Age in French — Modeling|last=Friedman|first=Vanessa|date=2017-05-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BMI of models older than 16 will also be taken into consideration, when determining their overall health.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; 

In contrast to the Israeli law, breaching it attracts criminal sanctions.&lt;ref name="vf"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedman|first1=Vanessa|title=A New Age in French — Modeling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/fashion/france-laws-thin-models.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, any photo that has been digitally altered must be labeled as such; failure to label these photos will result in a "fine of 37,500 euros, or more than $41,000," and hiring a model without the verified medical certificate and requirements "carries a fine of €75,000 and six months in jail." &lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; The law dictates that digitally altered images must be labeled "applies only to advertising, not to editorial images in magazines or newspapers." &lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;

The [[Greater London Authority]] banned advertisements that promote unhealthy body image on [[Transport for London]] public transport in 2016.&lt;ref name="ap/mo"&gt;{{cite news|title=London mayor bans Tube ads that promote unhealthy body image|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3640626/London-mayor-takes-aim-body-shaming-advertising-Tube.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[Mail Online]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Trondheim]] in Norway banned advertisements that promote unhealthy body image in public places in 2017.&lt;ref name="gs"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Samuels|first1=Gabriel|title=Norwegian city bans adverts featuring semi-nude models|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/norway-trondheim-ban-adverts-semi-naked-models-negative-body-image-a7026421.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[The Independent]]|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]]'s position in this area is that it is up to industry to solve the problem of poor body image.&lt;ref name="jw"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Jessica|title=Skinny models: Australia welcomes Paris ban|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/skinny-models-australia-welcomes-paris-ban-20150319-1m36t7.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the previous Labor Government created a non-binding Voluntary Industry Code of Conduct on Body Image.&lt;ref name="apo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voluntary industry code of conduct on body image|url=http://apo.org.au/node/21888|publisher=Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory|accessdate=5 November 2017|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Borjgali''' ({{lang-ka|ბორჯღალი}}; also '''Borjgala''' or '''Borjgalo''') is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] symbol of the [[Sun]] with seven rotating wings. 

==Etymology==
The term Borjgali is believed to derive from [[Mingrelian language|Megrelian]] word ბარჩხალი ("barchkhali"), which literally means "strong shining".
Some other scholars believe that it has different origins. In old Megrelian ''borj'' means "time" and ''gal'' means "pass" or "flow". So the whole phrase would mean "the flow of time".

==Modern usage==
[[File:Tedo Zibzibadze 2011.jpg|thumb|Georgian rugby player with Borjgali on his shorts and shirt]]
Nowadays, the symbol is used in Georgian IDs and passports, as well as on [[Georgian lari|currency]] and by the [[Georgia national rugby union team|Georgian Rugby Union]]. Georgian rugby team players are called ბორჯღალოსნები (''borjgalosnebi''), which means "Men bearing Borjgali". It was also used on the naval ensign of Georgia during the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Title: Album des pavillons nationaux et des marques distinctives / National flags and distinctive markings

'''Classical control theory''' is a branch of [[control theory]] that deals with the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s with inputs, and how their behavior is modified by [[feedback]], using the [[Laplace transform]] as a basic tool to model such systems.

The usual objective of control theory is to control a system, often called the ''[[Plant (control theory)|plant]]'', so its output follows a desired control signal, called the ''[[reference]]'', which may be a fixed or changing value.  To do this a ''[[Controller (control theory)|controller]]'' is designed, which monitors the output and compares it with the reference.  The difference between actual and desired output, called the ''error'' signal, is applied as [[feedback]] to the input of the system, to bring the actual output closer to the reference.

Classical control theory deals with [[linear time-invariant system|linear time-invariant]] [[single-input single-output]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhong|first1=Wan-Xie|title=Duality System in Applied Mechanics and Optimal Control|date=2004|publisher=Kluwer|isbn=978-1-4020-7880-4|page=283|quote=The classical controller design methodology is iterative, and is effective for single-input, single-output linear time-invariant system analysis and design.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Laplace transform of the input and output signal of such systems can be calculated. The [[transfer function]] relates the Laplace transform of the input and the output.

==Feedback==

To overcome the limitations of the [[open-loop controller]], classical control theory introduces [[feedback]]. A [[closed-loop controller]] uses feedback to control [[state (controls)|states]] or [[Negative feedback#Overview|output]]s of a [[dynamical system]]. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., [[voltage]] applied to an [[electric motor]]) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with [[sensor]]s and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is "fed back" as input to the process, closing the loop.

Closed-loop controllers have the following advantages over [[open-loop controller]]s:
* disturbance rejection (such as hills in the cruise control example above)
* guaranteed performance even with [[mathematical model|model]] uncertainties, when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact
* [[instability|unstable]] processes can be stabilized
* reduced sensitivity to parameter variations
* improved reference tracking performance

In some systems, closed-loop and open-loop control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed [[feed forward (control)|feedforward]] and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.

A common closed-loop controller architecture is the [[PID controller]].

==Classical vs modern==

A Physical system can be modeled in the "time domain", where the response of a given system is a function of the various inputs, the previous system values, and time. As time progresses, the state of the system and its response change. However, time-domain models for systems are frequently modeled using high-order differential equations which can become impossibly difficult for humans to solve and some of which can even become impossible for modern computer systems to solve efficiently.

To counteract this problem, classical control theory uses the [[Laplace transform]] to change an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the time domain into a regular algebraic polynomial in the transform domain. Once a given system has been converted into the transform domain it can be manipulated with greater ease.

[[Modern control theory]], instead of changing domains to avoid the complexities of time-domain ODE mathematics, converts the differential equations into a system of lower-order time domain equations called [[state space (control)|state equations]], which can then be manipulated using techniques from linear algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ogata|first1=Katsuhiko|title=Modern Control Systems|date=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-615673-4|page=2|edition=Fifth|quote=modern control theory, based on time-domain analysis and synthesis using state variables}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laplace transform==
{{main|Laplace transform}}

Classical control theory uses the Laplace transform to model the systems and signals. The Laplace transform is a frequency-domain approach for continuous time signals irrespective of whether the system is stable or unstable. The Laplace transform of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''(''t'')}}, defined for all [[real number]]s {{math|''t'' ≥ 0}}, is the function {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a unilateral transform defined by
: &lt;math&gt;F(s) =\int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s'' is a [[complex number]] frequency parameter
: &lt;math&gt;s = \sigma + i \omega&lt;/math&gt;, with real numbers {{math|''σ''}} and {{math|''ω''}}.

==Closed-loop transfer function==
{{details|closed-loop transfer function}}
The output of the system ''y(t)'' is fed back through a sensor measurement ''F'' to the reference value ''r(t)''. The controller ''C'' then takes the error ''e'' (difference) between the reference and the output to change the inputs ''u'' to the system under control ''P''. This is shown in the figure. This kind of controller is a closed-loop controller or feedback controller.

This is called a single-input-single-output (''SISO'') control system; ''MIMO'' (i.e., Multi-Input-Multi-Output) systems, with more than one input/output, are common. In such cases variables are represented through [[coordinate vector|vectors]] instead of simple [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values. For some [[distributed parameter systems]] the vectors may be infinite-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] (typically functions).

[[File:simple feedback control loop2.svg|center|A simple feedback control loop]]

If we assume the controller ''C'', the plant ''P'', and the sensor ''F'' are [[linear]] and [[time-invariant]] (i.e., elements of their [[transfer function]] ''C(s)'', ''P(s)'', and ''F(s)'' do not depend on time), the systems above can be analysed using the [[Laplace transform]] on the variables. This gives the following relations:

: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = P(s) U(s)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;U(s) = C(s) E(s)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;E(s) = R(s) - F(s)Y(s).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''Y''(''s'') in terms of ''R''(''s'') gives

: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = \left( \frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)} \right) R(s) = H(s)R(s).&lt;/math&gt;

The expression &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)}&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the ''closed-loop transfer function'' of the system. The numerator is the forward (open-loop) gain from ''r'' to ''y'', and the denominator is one plus the gain in going around the feedback loop, the so-called loop gain. If &lt;math&gt;|P(s)C(s)| \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., it has a large [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] with each value of ''s'', and if &lt;math&gt;|F(s)| \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;, then ''Y(s)'' is approximately equal to ''R(s)'' and the output closely tracks the reference input.

==PID controller==
{{details|PID controller}}
The [[PID controller]] is probably the most-used feedback control design. ''PID'' is an initialism for ''Proportional-Integral-Derivative'', referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal. If ''u(t)'' is the control signal sent to the system, ''y(t)'' is the measured output and ''r(t)'' is the desired output, and tracking error &lt;math&gt;e(t)=r(t)- y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, a PID controller has the general form

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) =  K_P e(t) + K_I \int e(t)\text{d}t + K_D \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}e(t).&lt;/math&gt;

The desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters &lt;math&gt; K_P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; K_I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; K_D&lt;/math&gt;, often iteratively by "tuning" and without specific knowledge of a plant model. Stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term. The integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance (often a striking specification in [[process control]]). The derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response. PID controllers are the most well established class of control systems: however, they cannot be used in several more complicated cases, especially if multiple-input multiple-output systems (MIMO) systems are considered.

Applying Laplace transformation results in the transformed PID controller equation

:&lt;math&gt;u(s) =  K_P e(s) + K_I \frac{1}{s} e(s) + K_D s e(s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u(s) =  \left(K_P + K_I \frac{1}{s} + K_D s\right) e(s)&lt;/math&gt;

with the PID controller transfer function
:&lt;math&gt;C(s) = \left(K_P + K_I \frac{1}{s} + K_D s\right).&lt;/math&gt;
There exists a nice example of the closed-loop system discussed above. If we take

PID controller transfer function in series form

:&lt;math&gt;C(s) =  K \left(1 + \frac{1}{sT_i}\right)(1 + sT_d)&lt;/math&gt;

1st order filter in feedback loop

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \frac{1}{1 + sT_f}&lt;/math&gt;

linear actuator with filtered input

:&lt;math&gt;P(s) = \frac{A}{1 + sT_p}&lt;/math&gt;,   A = const

and insert all this into expression for closed-loop transfer function H(s), then tuning is very easy: simply put

:&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{A},   T_i = T_f,   T_d = T_p&lt;/math&gt;

and get H(s) = 1 identically.

For practical PID controllers, a pure differentiator is neither physically realisable nor desirable&lt;ref&gt;Ang, K.H., Chong, G.C.Y., and Li, Y. (2005). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1453566 PID control system analysis, design, and technology, ''IEEE Trans Control Systems Tech'', 13(4), pp.559-576].&lt;/ref&gt; due to amplification of noise and resonant modes in the system. Therefore, a phase-lead compensator type approach is used instead, or a differentiator with low-pass roll-off.

==Tools==

Classical control theory uses an array of tools to analyze systems and design controllers for such systems. Tools include the [[root locus]], the [[Nyquist stability criterion]], the [[Bode plot]], the [[gain margin]] and [[phase margin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6320">{{More citations needed|date=May 2016}}
In [[computer science]], a '''composite data type''' or '''compound data type''' is any [[data type]] which can be constructed in a program using the [[programming language]]'s [[primitive data types]] and other composite types.  It is sometimes called a '''structure''' or '''aggregate data type''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howe|first1=Denis|title=The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aggregate%20type|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the latter term may also refer to [[Array data type|arrays]], [[List (abstract data type)|lists]], etc.  The act of constructing a composite type is known as [[Object composition|composition]].

==C/C++ structures and classes==
{{Split section portions|struct (C programming language)|date=July 2014}}
{{details|C++ classes}}
A &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; is [[C (programming language)|C]]'s and [[C++]]'s notion of a composite type, a datatype that composes a fixed set of labeled '''fields''' or '''members'''. It is so called because of the &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; keyword used in declaring them, which is short for ''structure'' or, more precisely, ''user-defined data structure''.{{Citation needed|reason=Please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=March 2009}}

In C++, the only difference between a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; and a [[class (computer science)|class]] is the default [[access level]], which is ''private'' for classes and ''public'' for &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s.

Note that while classes and the &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]] were completely new in C++, the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] already had a crude type of &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s. For all intents and purposes, C++ &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s form a [[superset]] of C &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s: virtually all valid C &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s are valid C++ &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s with the same semantics.

===Declaration===
A &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; declaration consists of a list of fields, each of which can have any type.  The total storage required for a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; object is the sum of the storage requirements of all the fields, plus any internal [[Data structure alignment#Data structure padding|padding]].

For example:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct Account {
   int account_number;
   char *first_name;
   char *last_name;
   float balance;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

defines a type, '''''referred''''' to as &lt;code&gt;struct Account&lt;/code&gt;. To create a new variable of this type, we can write &lt;code&gt;struct Account myAccount;&lt;/code&gt;
which has an integer component, accessed by &lt;code&gt;myAccount.account_number&lt;/code&gt;, and a floating-point component, accessed by &lt;code&gt;myAccount.balance&lt;/code&gt;, as well as the &lt;code&gt;first_name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;last_name&lt;/code&gt; components. The structure &lt;code&gt;myAccount&lt;/code&gt; contains all four values, and all four fields may be changed independently.

Since writing &lt;code&gt;struct Account&lt;/code&gt; repeatedly in code becomes cumbersome, it is not unusual to see a &lt;code&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt; statement in C code to provide a more convenient synonym for the &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;.

For example:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
typedef struct Account_ {
   int    account_number;
   char   *first_name;
   char   *last_name;
   float  balance;
} Account;
&lt;/source&gt;

In C++ code, the [[Typedef|&lt;code&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt;]] is not needed because types defined using &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; are already part of the regular namespace, so the type can be referred to as either &lt;code&gt;struct Account&lt;/code&gt; or simply &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt;.

As another example, a three-dimensional Vector composite type that uses the floating point data type could be created with:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct Vector {
  float x;
  float y;
  float z;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

A variable named &lt;code&gt;velocity&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt; composite type would be declared as &lt;code&gt;Vector velocity;&lt;/code&gt; Members of the &lt;code&gt;velocity&lt;/code&gt; would be accessed using a dot notation.  For example, &lt;code&gt;velocity.x = 5;&lt;/code&gt; would set the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; component of &lt;code&gt;velocity&lt;/code&gt; equal to 5.

Likewise, a color structure could be created using:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct Color {
  unsigned int red;
  unsigned int green;
  unsigned int blue;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

In 3D graphics, you usually must keep track of both the position and color of each vertex.  One way to do this would be to create a &lt;code&gt;Vertex&lt;/code&gt; composite type, using the previously created &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt; composite types:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct Vertex {
  Vector position;
  Color color;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

===Instantiation===
Create a variable of type &lt;code&gt;struct Vertex&lt;/code&gt; using the same format as before: &lt;code&gt;Vertex v;&lt;/code&gt;

===Member access===
Assign values to the components of &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; like so:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
v.position.x = 0.0;
v.position.y = 1.5;
v.position.z = 0.0;
v.color.red = 128;
v.color.green = 0;
v.color.blue = 255;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Primitive subtype===
The primary use of &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; is for the construction of complex datatypes, but sometimes it is used to create primitive [[Structural type system|structural]] [[subtype|subtyping]]. For example, since [[Standard C]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} requires that if two structs have the same initial fields, those fields will be represented in the same way, the code

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
struct ifoo_old_stub {
   long x, y;
};
struct ifoo_version_42 {
   long x, y, z;
   char *name;
   long a, b, c;
};
void operate_on_ifoo(struct ifoo_old_stub *);
struct ifoo_version_42 s;
. . .
operate_on_ifoo(&amp;s);
&lt;/source&gt;

will work correctly.

==Type signature==
[[Type signature]]s (or [[Function type]]s) are constructed from primitive and composite types, and can serve as types themselves when constructing composite types:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} Point;

typedef double (*Metric) (Point p1, Point p2);

typedef struct {
    Point centre;
    double radius;
    Metric metric;
} Circle;
&lt;/source&gt;

A '''countdown''' is a sequence of backward counting to indicate the time remaining before an event is scheduled to occur. [[NASA]] commonly employs the terms "L-minus" and "T-minus" &lt;ref name=L-Minus&gt;{{web cite|title=@NASA_LSP|author=NASA's Launch Services Program|url=https://twitter.com/nasa_lsp/status/561519037591846912|date=2015-01-31&lt;!-- 13:39:05 UTC--&gt;|via=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the preparation for and anticipation of a rocket launch, and even "E-minus" for events that involve spacecraft that are already in space, where the "T" could stand for "Test" or "Time", and the "E" stands for "Encounter", as with a comet or some other space object.&lt;ref name=E-Minus&gt;{{cite news|title=NASA Mission 'E-Minus' One Month to Comet Flyby|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/epoxi/epoxi20101004.html|accessdate=2013-09-13|newspaper=NASA Mission News|date=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other events for which countdowns are commonly used include the detonation of an explosive, the start of a race, the start of the [[New Year]], or any anxiously anticipated event. An early use of a countdown once signaled the start of a [[Cambridge University]] rowing race.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Everett|Everett, William]].

A countdown is a carefully devised set of procedures ending with the ignition of a rocket's engine. Depending on the type of vehicle used, countdowns can start from 72 to 96 hours before launch time.

During countdown:
* Aerospace personnel bring the rocket vehicle to the launch site and load it with payload and propellants;
* Launch-center computers communicate with sensors in the rocket, which monitor important systems on the launch vehicle and payload;
* Launch personnel monitor the weather and wait for the [[launch window]];
* Security personnel prevent unauthorized persons from entering the "keep-out" area.&lt;ref&gt;Angelo, Joseph A. ''Space Technology.'' 2003, [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]; {{ISBN|1-57356-335-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57356-335-2}}, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedures for each launch are written carefully. For the [[Space Shuttle]], a five-volume set, Shuttle Countdown (KSC S0007), often referred to as "S0007", was used. Rosie Carver, a [[technical writer]] for [[United Launch Alliance]], has created at least 15,000 procedures for more than 300 missions since the [[Solar Maximum Mission]], which launched Feb. 14, 1980. These documents are living documents, which reflect new issues and solutions as they develop. Each mission requires approximately 100 procedure books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/launchingrockets/carver.html NASA, "Launching by the Book"], April 30, 2007. [[NASA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proceeding with the countdown depends on several factors, such as the proper launch window, weather that permits a safe launch, and the rocket and payload working properly.

[[File:Countdown clock at NASAs Kennedy Space Center on 28 April 2011 (5665401600).jpg|thumb|Countdown clock at NASA's [[Kennedy Space Center]] at L-11 hours (28 April 2011) of STS-134, [[Space Shuttle Endeavour]].]]
The launch weather guidelines involving the Space Shuttle and expendable rockets are similar in many areas, but a distinction is made for the individual characteristics of each. The criteria are broadly conservative and assure avoidance of possibly adverse conditions. They are reviewed for each launch. For the Space Shuttle, weather "outlooks" provided by the U. S. Air Force Range Weather Operations Facility at Cape Canaveral began at Launch minus 5 days in coordination with the NOAA National Weather Service Spaceflight Meteorology Group at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. These include weather trends and their possible effects on launch day. A formal prelaunch weather briefing was held on Launch minus 1 day, which is a specific weather briefing for all areas of Space Shuttle launch operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kennedy Space Flight Center Release 39-99: Space Shuttle weather launch commit criteria and KSD end of mission weather landing criteria |date=May 20, 1999 |url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/release/1999/39-99.htm |publisher=Nasa.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626180630/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/release/1999/39-99.htm |archivedate=June 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch window is a precise time during which aerospace personnel launch a rocket so the payload can reach the proper orbital destination.&lt;ref name="Angelo 2003: 144"&gt;Angelo 2003: 144&lt;/ref&gt;

A hold is the suspension of the normal countdown process. This can be done to investigate a technical process that has gone wrong, or because of marginal weather at the launch pad.

Some holds are planned: they are done so the launch-support computers can run automatic checks on the rocket.

Under some circumstances, a countdown may be recycled to an earlier time. When that happens, launch personnel begin following the countdown checklist from the earlier point.&lt;ref name="Angelo 2003: 144"/&gt;

During communications for a countdown, the launch team uses acronyms to keep channels open as much as possible. All Firing Room console positions are assigned unique 'call signs' that are used by the team for quick and positive identification of who is talking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/countdown/launch-team.html |title=NASA, "The Space Shuttle launch team" |publisher=Science.ksc.nasa.gov |date=1967-11-09 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, dialogue heard during the launch of a [[Delta II]] rocket carrying the [[Kepler Space Telescope]] on March 8, 2009, included:

[[File:STS-121 Launch.jpg|thumb|Seven seconds after launch of [[STS-121]], the [[Press Site-Clock and Flag Pole|countdown clock]] at [[Launch Complex 39|LC-39]] at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] seen counting up, rather than down.]]
In the context of a rocket launch, the "L minus Time" is the physical time before launch, e.g. "L minus 3 minutes and 40 seconds". "T minus Time" is a system to mark points at which actions necessary for the launch are planned - this time stops and starts as various hold points are entered, and so doesn't show the actual time to launch. The last ten seconds are usually counted down aloud "Ten seconds to liftoff. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one." After a launch, most countdown clocks begin to show [[Mission Elapsed Time]], which is typically shown as "T plus."  The adjacent picture shows "+ 00:00:07", approximately seven seconds after liftoff.

In [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[film]] ''[[Frau im Mond]]'', after each number the phrase "seconds to go" was repeated.

When counting down to the launch of an [[explosive]], e.g. when testing a new model of gun, it is customary to omit "5" from the countdown sequence because "five" sounds too similar to 'Fire!'{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

== Film ==
[[File:Eight (film start) cropped2.jpg|thumb|Newer (1959) SMPTE countdown on the head leader of a film reel]]
At the start of films, a countdown sequence is printed on the [[Film leader|head leader]], and is used to synchronize film reel changeovers (switching between reels of film). In film (but not television) the 'Academy Leader' countdown first used in 1930 is in units of feet rather than time units; it starts at 11 and ends at 3 where it cuts to black for the last few feet. In 1959, SMPTE leader was created and measures seconds, not feet. It starts at 8 and cuts to black on the first frame of 2, which is accompanied by a 'pop.  This leader eventually displaced the older Academy and was the only leader used by the end of the optical projection era.

==New Year's Eve==
{{Main|New Year's Eve}}
In many [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations, there is a countdown during the last seconds of the old year until the beginning of the new year.

In Times Square on New Year's Eve, besides the 60-Second Countdown at 11:59 P.M., there are six 20-second hourly countdowns in which people can practice their countdown skills from 5:59 P.M. to 10:59 P.M. The aforementioned countdowns are also the countdowns to the end of each hour.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

'''Criticism of government''' may refer to criticism of particular government, or of the concept of government itself. In certain cases, such as in certain monarchies and authoritarian (or sometimes totalitarian or dictatorial) governments, criticizing the government is considered [[criminal speech]] and is punished in accord which the perceived severity of the claimed crime.
* [[Anarchism]] – according to one definition, is the concept that all government is bad, and people would do better with no government.
* [[Criticism of royalty]] – this includes criticism of the monarchy, and royal families
* [[Criticism of democracy]] – criticism of democracy comes from various points of view, including monarchical, authoritarian, totalitarian, and libertarian points of view.
* [[Criticism of communism (disambiguation)]]
* [[Criticism of socialism]]
* [[Presidential_system#Criticism_and_disadvantages|Criticism of presidential systems]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6396">In [[mathematics]], and particularly in [[axiomatic set theory]], the '''diamond principle''' {{math|◊}} is a [[combinatorial principle]] introduced by [[Ronald Jensen]] in {{harvtxt|Jensen|1972}} that holds in the [[constructible universe]] ({{math|''L''}}) and that implies the [[continuum hypothesis]]. Jensen extracted the diamond principle from his proof that the [[Axiom of constructibility]] ({{math|''V'' {{=}} ''L''}}) implies the existence of a [[Suslin tree]].

== Definitions ==
The diamond principle {{math|◊}} says that there exists a '''{{vanchor|◊-sequence}}''', in other words sets {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' ⊆ ''α''}} for {{math|''α'' &lt; ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that for any subset {{math|''A''}} of [[First uncountable ordinal|ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] the set of {{math|''α''}} with {{math|''A'' ∩ ''α'' {{=}} ''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''}}  is [[Stationary set|stationary]] in {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

There are several equivalent forms of the diamond principle. One states that there is a countable collection {{math|'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of subsets of {{math|''α''}} for each countable ordinal {{math|''α''}} such that for any subset {{math|''A''}} of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} there is a stationary subset {{math|''C''}} of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that for all {{math|''α''}} in {{math|''C''}} we have {{math|''A'' ∩ ''α'' ∈ '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''C'' ∩ ''α''  ∈ '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Another equivalent form states that there exist sets {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''α''}} for {{math|''α'' &lt; ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that for any subset {{mvar|''A''}} of {{mvar|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} there is at least one infinite {{mvar|''α''}} with {{mvar|''A'' ∩ ''α'' {{=}} ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

More generally, for a given [[cardinal number]] {{math|''κ''}} and a [[stationary set]] {{math|''S'' ⊆ ''κ''}}, the statement {{math|◊&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (sometimes written {{math|◊(''S'')}} or {{math|◊&lt;sub&gt;''κ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')}}) is the statement that there is a [[sequence]] {{math|⟨''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''α'' ∈ ''S''⟩}} such that

* each {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' ⊆ ''α''}}
* for every {{math|''A'' ⊆ ''κ''}}, {{math|{''α'' ∈ ''S'' : ''A'' ∩ ''α'' {{=}} ''A&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} is stationary in {{math|''κ''}}

The principle {{math|◊&lt;sub&gt;''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the same as {{math|◊}}.

The diamond-plus principle {{math|◊&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} says that there exists a '''{{math|◊&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}-sequence''', in other words a countable collection {{math|'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of subsets of {{math|''α''}} for each countable ordinal α such that for any subset {{math|''A''}} of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} there is a closed unbounded subset {{math|''C''}} of {{math|''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that for all {{math|''α''}} in {{math|''C''}} we have {{math|''A'' ∩ ''α'' ∈ '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''C'' ∩ ''α'' ∈ '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

== Properties and use ==

{{harvtxt|Jensen|1972}} showed that the diamond principle {{math|◊}} implies the existence of [[Suslin tree]]s. He also showed that [[V=L|{{math|''V'' {{=}} ''L''}}]] implies the diamond-plus principle, which implies the diamond principle, which implies [[continuum hypothesis|CH]]. In particular the diamond principle and the diamond-plus principle are both [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of the axioms of ZFC. Also {{math|[[clubsuit|♣]] + CH}} implies {{math|◊}}, but [[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]] gave models of {{math|♣ + ¬ CH,}} so {{math|◊}} and {{math|♣}} are not equivalent (rather, {{math|♣}} is weaker than {{math|◊}}).

The diamond principle {{math|◊}} does not imply the existence of a [[Kurepa tree]], but the stronger {{math|◊&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} principle implies both the {{math|◊}} principle and the existence of a Kurepa tree.

{{harvtxt|Akemann|Weaver|2004}} used {{math|◊}} to construct a [[C* algebra|{{math|''C''*}}-algebra]] serving as a [[counterexample]] to [[Naimark's problem]].

For all cardinals {{math|''κ''}} and [[stationary subset]]s {{math|''S'' ⊆ ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|◊&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}} holds in the [[constructible universe]]. {{harvtxt|Shelah|2010}} proved that for {{math|''κ'' &gt; ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|◊{{su|b=''κ''|p=+}}(''S'')}} follows from {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''κ''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} for stationary {{math|''S''}} that do not contain ordinals of cofinality {{math|''κ''}}.

Shelah showed that the diamond principle solves the [[Whitehead problem]] by implying that every [[Whitehead problem|Whitehead group]] is free.

An '''eco-industrial park''' ('''EIP''') is an [[industrial park]] in which [[businesses]] cooperate with each other and with the [[Local government|local community]] in an attempt to reduce waste and pollution, efficiently share resources (such as information, materials, water, [[Electric power|energy]], [[infrastructure]], and [[natural resources]]), and help achieve [[sustainable development]], with the intention of increasing [[Profit (economics)|economic gains]] and improving [[Natural environment|environmental quality]].&lt;ref&gt;AM Hein, M Jankovic, R Farel, B Yannou 2015. A Conceptual Framework For Eco-Industrial Parks. Proceedings of the ASME 2015 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences &amp; Computers and Information in Engineering Conference IDETC/CIE 2015&lt;/ref&gt; An EIP may also be planned, designed, and built in such a way that it makes it easier for businesses to co-operate, and that results in a more financially sound, environmentally friendly project for the developer.

The Eco-industrial Park Handbook&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Ernest A. 2001. Eco-industrial Park Handbook for Asian Developing Countries. A Report to Asian Development Bank, Environment Department, Indigo Development, Oakland, CA&lt;/ref&gt; states that "An Eco-Industrial Park is a community of manufacturing and service businesses located together on a common property. Members seek enhanced environmental, economic, and social performance through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues."

Based on the concepts of [[industrial ecology]], collaborative strategies not only include [[by-product synergy]] ("waste-to-feed" exchanges), but can also take the form of wastewater cascading, shared logistics and shipping &amp; receiving facilities, shared parking, green technology purchasing blocks, multi-partner [[green building]] retrofit, [[Distributed generation|district energy]] systems, and local education and resource centres. This is an application of a [[systems approach]], in which designs and processes/activities are integrated to address multiple objectives.

EIPs can be developed as [[greenfield land]] projects, where the eco-industrial intent is present throughout the planning, design and site construction phases, or developed through retrofits and new strategies in existing industrial developments.

==Examples==
[[Image:IndustrialSymbiosisWasteHeatExchange.png|250px|right|thumb|Example of Industrial Symbiosis. Waste steam from a waste incinerator (right) is piped to an ethanol plant (left) where it is used as in input to their production process.]]
"[[Industrial symbiosis]]" is a related but more limited concept in which companies in a region collaborate to utilize each other's by-products and otherwise share resources. In  [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park|Kalundborg, Denmark]] a symbiosis network links a 1500MW [[Coal-fired power station|coal-fired power plant]] with the community and other companies.  [[Waste heat|Surplus heat]] from this power plant is used to heat 3500 local homes in addition to a nearby [[fish farm]], whose [[sludge]] is then sold as a [[fertilizer]].  [[Steam]] from the power plant is sold to [[Novo Nordisk]], a [[pharmaceutical]] and [[enzyme]] manufacturer, in addition to a [[Statoil]] plant.  This reuse of [[Waste heat|heat]] reduces the amount [[thermal pollution]] discharged to a nearby [[fjord]].  Additionally, a by-product from the power plant's [[sulfur dioxide]] [[scrubber]] contains [[gypsum]], which is sold to a [[wallboard]] manufacturer.  Almost all of the manufacturer's [[gypsum]] needs are met this way, which reduces the amount of [[open-pit mining]] needed.  Furthermore, [[fly ash]] and [[clinker (waste)|clinker]] from the power plant is utilized for road building and [[cement]] production.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ehrenfeld and N. Gertler(1997), "Industrial Ecology in Practice. The Evolution of Interdependence at Kalundborg",''Journal of Industrial Ecology'', 1:1, pp 67–79&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrial symbiosis at Kalundborg was not created as a top-down initiative, but instead evolved gradually.  As environmental regulations became stricter, firms were motivated reduce the cost of compliance, and turn their by-products into economic products.

In [[Canada]], eco-industrial parks exist across the country and have enjoyed some success. The best known example is [[Burnside, Nova Scotia|Burnside Park]], in Halifax, Nova Scotia. With support from [[Dalhousie University]]’s Eco-Efficiency Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eco-efficiency.management.dal.ca/About_Us/|title=Eco‑Efficiency Centre|website=Dalhousie University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the more than 1,500 businesses have been improving their environmental performance and developing profitable partnerships. Subsequently, two greenfield industrial developments have been started in [[Alberta]]: TaigaNova Eco-Industrial Park&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taiganova.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206153958/http://www.taiganova.com/ |date=2008-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is in the heart of the [[Athabasca oil sands]], while Innovista Eco-Industrial Park&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eip.hinton.ca {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608024948/http://www.eip.hinton.ca/ |date=2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a gateway to the [[Rocky Mountains]] ~300km west of [[Edmonton]].

UNIDO Viet Nam (United Nations Industrial Development Organization) has compiled a list in 2015 of Eco-Industrial Parks (EIP) in the ASEAN Economic Community in a report titled "[https://www.unido.org/fileadmin/user_media_upgrade/Resources/Publications/UCO_Viet_Nam_Study_FINAL.pdf Economic Zones in the ASEAN]" written by Arnault Morisson.

==Other usage==
EIPs also refer to industrial parks where a "green" approach has been taken towards the infrastructure and development of the site. This can include [[green infrastructure]] related to [[Renewable Energy Systems]]; [[stormwater]], [[groundwater]] and [[wastewater]] management; road surfaces; and [[transportation demand management]]. [[Green building]] practices can also be encouraged or mandated

EIPs are often used as a stimulus for economic diversification in the community or region where they are located. Anchor tenants, such as bio-based product manufacturers or [[waste-to-energy]] facilities, etc., can attract complementary businesses as suppliers, scavengers/recyclers, service providers, downstream users and other businesses that could benefit from eco-industrial strategies.

==Suggested usage==

It is suggested that EIPs be used as a means of growing the renewable energy sector. In the case of a Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Manufacturing plant, an EIP can increase the manufacturing efficiency to make it more economical, while reducing the environmental impact of producing the solar cells. In essence, this assists the growth of the [[renewable energy industry]] and the environmental benefits that come with replacing fossil-fuels.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Pearce, Industrial Symbiosis for Very Large Scale Photovoltaic Manufacturing, Renewable Energy 33, pp. 1101-1108, 2008,[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V4S-4PJ6BJ9-1/2/f3df89a481dc23c1853d998d0d282cae]&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal strain within a metal is either [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] or [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]].  In the case of elastic strain this is observed as a distortion of the [[crystal lattice]], in the case of plastic strain this is observed by the presence of dislocations –the displacement of part of the [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]]. Such strain effects can result in unwanted cracking of the material, as is the case with residual plastic strain. In other cases deliberate introduction of plastic strain results in a strengthening of the material and other performance enhancing behaviors, for example in the manufacture of [[Semiconductor|semi-conductors]] and [[solar cell]]s.

== Fundamentals ==
As an illustration, if you hang a weight on a spring it extends in direct proportion to the load.  That is the same effect that occurs in the elastic deformation part of the standard tensile test.

This is normally written as:  applied stress = [[Young's modulus|Young’s modulus]]  *  strain

That is: σ        =           Y                 *    e

Commonly known as:  [[Hooke’s Law]].

Where stress is a force ( a vector property) divided by the cross sectional area. Strain is the displacement (also a vector quantity) per unit length and is also a vector quantity.  A vector quantity requires three numbers to define its direction.  It can be represented then by a number with one subscript, Ui, where i takes the numbers 1 to 3.  Such a quantity can be referred to as a tensor of rank 1.  The rank refers to the number of subscripts.  The strains e can be formally written as a differential or gradient.  So that, if u1 was the extension in the x direction, we would write the strain as δu1/δx.   
We also know that when we stretch something it gets thinner in the direction normal to the stretch direction.  This is the [[Poisson effect]] and the ratio extension /contraction is the [[Poisson ratio]].

== Illustration of Poisson effect ==
{{Missing information|images|date=May 2018}}

This coupling of the different strains caused in a sample by the application of a stress classifies strain as a tensor property. In fact it is a second rank tensor because it consists of a 3 x 3 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and hence each element will need two suffixes to locate any one of its components in the matrix, i.e. eij.  The physical significance of this will be apparent later.

We set up a co-ordinate system based on some reference axes in the sample.  A convenient one for the case illustrated above is included in the figure.  It is a right handed system when reading the axes in the sequence x y z.   If we start at a point on the positive x axis and rotate towards the positive y axis in a clockwise direction then positive  z axis would point in the direction of movement of a right handed screw.

To keep it as clear as possible which reference axes we are using it is conventional often to refer to these axes as 1 2 and 3.  This is to allow easy identification of the strain terms as depicted in the tenor 3x3 matrix. The directions 1 2 and 3 are synonymous with the x y and z directions.

In a sample strained in tension ([[Tension (physics)|uni-axial tension]]) as in the above figure, the z axis has been strained in the positive sense, i.e. it becomes longer.  The strain term for this deformation is e33. The applied force is acting in the z direction.  The first subscript refers to the axis that is being strained and the second to the direction it is being strained.  Thus the first subscript 3 refers to the strain is occurring along the z axis and the second subscript to the fact that the strain is in the direction of the z axis.  Likewise for the strains e11 and e 22.   The strains e 11,  e 22 and e 33 are known as tensile or normal strains.
The force along z can also be resolved onto inclined planes causing these planes to shear resulting in [[shear strain]]s. It will also cause the crystal to rotate (called a rigid body rotation).  To illustrate this I include a more general deformation, as shown next.

Illustration of tensile and shear strains plus rotation in x z plane.
x y z right handed axis system, u1 u2 u3 displacements in x y z directions.
The figure shows only deformation, that is change of length and direction, in the x z plane for clarity. The tensile strains e11 and e 33 are shown plus the two strains e 13 and e 31.  Note  the differential form of these latter strains as shown in the figure.  Let us consider for now that there is no rotation. Then e 13 and e 31 represent the shear components alone and are in fact equal. The first of the subscript in both of e 13 and e31 signifies the plane that is sheared and the second component the axis defining the direction of shear.  Hence the first shear component e13 describes the shear of the plane normal to the x axis and in the z direction whilst the second, e31 defines the shear of the plane normal to the z axis in the x direction. 
Simple (mechanical) shear versus physics
Now some of you may say, ‘surely shear of a plane distorts a crystal’ as shown in the left sketch below.

Simple shear. (Engineering) Shear  (Physics)
Well this is true and is how engineers express it.  As shown in the right hand figure, the shear strain as used in engineering is twice that used by physicists.  Engineering strain measures the total strain in the xz  plane and is often given the symbol γ.  On the other hand,  e31, which remember  =  δu3/δx and in this case where there is no rotation, is simply the average of the strains on the z and x faces i.e. ε31 = ½(e31+e13). Note I have changed the symbol from e31 to ε31.  The symbol e31 refers to the strains as measured and may contain a rotational component. The symbol ε31 refers specifically to the shear strain component included in the e31 term.   You may need to note this when involved in discussion with engineers.  For consistency the Greek symbol ε is used instead of e for the tensile strains as well.
Tensors in Strain
Tensors: Geometric entities introduced into mathematics and physics to extend the notion of scalars, (geometric) vectors, and matrices. Many physical quantities are naturally regarded not as vectors themselves, but as correspondences between one set of vectors and another.

== Techniques for measuring strain ==
There is a wide variety of strain measurement techniques, depending on the resolution and precision required.  Larger scale methods include the use of [[strain gauge]]s.  For higher precision [[Raman scattering|Raman Spectroscopy]] and recently emerging techniques such as [[EBSD]] are used.
Traditional measurement of residual strain in metals is through x-ray diffraction.  Unfortunately this has major shortcomings in today’s applications and material’s development environment:
* Probe size (width) is too large for nano-scale material structures.
* Probe size (depth) is typically too large for nano-scale material structures.
Result: Diffraction volume is too large and individual grains (crystal lattices) cannot be observed or measured accurately.

The advanced application of the alternative diffraction technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) overcomes these limitations.  Software applications such as [http://www.vantagesoftwareinc.com/wp/products/ CrossCourt3] have enabled practical measurement at the nanoscale quite possible.

== Electron backscatter diffraction ==
The technique of [[Electron backscatter diffraction|EBSD]] produces patterns from the metal’s [[crystallography]] that consist of a well-defined geometric arrangement of bright bands edged by sharp lines.  These are known as Kikuchi bands and Kikuchi lines respectively. Elastic strain changes the width of these bands, and the angles between them plus a general rotation of the entire pattern.   The total result is a distortion that involves dilation of the crystal lattice (or unit cell) as a result of tensile and compressive strains, shear strains and rotation.  A complete description of internal elastic strain requires that all these crystallographic parameters be measured.  This is a benefit of advanced or high accuracy EBSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Angus J.|last2=Britton|first2=T.

An '''experimental language''' is a [[constructed language]] designed for [[linguistics]] research, often on the relationship between [[language and thought]].

One particular assumption having received much attention in fiction is popularly known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]].  The claim is that the structure of a language somehow affects the way its speakers perceive their world, either strongly, in which case "language determines thought" ([[linguistic determinism]]), or weakly, in which case "language influences thought" ([[linguistic relativity]]). (For a list of languages that are merely mentioned, see the relevant section in [[List of constructed languages]].)

The extreme case of the strong version of the hypothesis would be the idea that words have a power inherent to themselves such that their use determines not just our thoughts, but even that which our thoughts are about, i.e. reality itself. This idea, however, is more properly treated within [[ontology]] than linguistics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Languages exploring the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis==

===Constructed languages===
* [[Láadan]] was designed by [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] in her science fiction novel [[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|''Native Tongue'']]'','' about a patriarchal society in which the overriding priority of the oppressed women is the secret development of a "feminist" language, Láadan, to aid them in throwing off their shackles.
* [[Loglan]], by [[James Cooke Brown]], was designed for linguistic research with the specific goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true. 
* [[Lojban]] is the successor of Loglan and has the same goals.
* [[Toki Pona]], by [[Sonja Elen Kisa]], is inspired by [[Taoist]] philosophy, among other things, and designed to shape the thought processes of its users in Zen-like fashion.

===Fictional languages===

====Named====
* ''[[Babel-17]]'', by [[Samuel R. Delany]], is centered on a fictional language that denies its speakers independent thought, forcing them to think purely logical thoughts. This language is used as a weapon of war, because it is supposed to convert everyone who learns it to a traitor. In the novel, the language Babel-17 is likened to computer programming languages that do not allow errors or imprecise statements.
* [[The Culture#Language|Marain]], in [[Iain M. Banks]]'s [[Culture series]]. The Culture believes (or perhaps has proved, or else actively made true) the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language affects society, and Marain was designed to exploit this effect. A related comment is made by the narrator in ''[[The Player of Games]]'' regarding gender-specific pronouns in English. Marain is also regarded as an aesthetically pleasing language.
* [[Newspeak]], by [[George Orwell]] in his dystopian novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', does not have any of the words expressing the ideas underlying a revolution with the idea that its speakers cannot revolt. All of the theory of Newspeak is aimed at eliminating such words. For example, ''bad'' has been replaced by ''ungood'', and the concept of "freedom" has been eliminated over time. According to the appendix on Newspeak, the result of the adoption of the language would be that "a heretical thought ... should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words."
* [[Pravic]] is one of the languages used in ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], that takes place partly on a world with an anarcho-communist society. Pravic contains little means for expressing possessive relationships, among other features.
* Tamarian, in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Darmok]]", is unintelligible to Starfleet's universal translators because it is too deeply rooted in local metaphor and consequently its sentences have no meaning to other civilizations.

====Unnamed====
* In ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'', by [[Ayn Rand]], the World Council attempted to enforce collectivist thinking among the populace by removing from the language all words expressing individuality.
* In ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', by [[Frank Herbert]], [[Lady Jessica]] (who has extensive linguistic training) encounters the [[Fremen]], the native people of Dune. She is shocked by the violence of their language, as she believes their word choices and language structure reflect a culture of enormous violence. Similarly, earlier in the novel, her late husband, Duke Leto, muses on how the nature of Imperial society is betrayed by "the precise delineations for treacherous death" in its language, the use of highly specific terms to describe different methods for delivering poison.
* In [[Gulf (Heinlein)|''Gulf'']], by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], the characters are taught an artificial language which allows them to think logically and concisely by removing the "false to fact" linguistic constructs of existing languages.
* ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'', by [[Jack Vance]], centers on an experiment in modeling a civilization by tweaking its language. The mastermind behind this experiment, Lord Palafox, says in chapter 9: "We must alter the mental framework of the Paonese people, which is most easily achieved by altering the language." His son, Finisterle, says in chapter 11 to a class of linguists in training: "every language impresses a certain world-view upon the mind."
* In ''Mud/Aurora'', by [[D.D. Storm]], society is divided in three classes speaking three different languages, designed to allow survival on a hostile, deserted world of a wrecked starship's crew and their descendants. The long-forgotten ship's linguist hid the true history of their world within the language spoken by the descendants of the commanding officers, the Sah.
* ''[[Snow Crash]]'', by [[Neal Stephenson]], explores the (controversial) concept of [[neuro-linguistic programming]] and presents the [[Sumerian language]] as the [[firmware]] programming language for the [[brain stem]] which is supposedly functioning as the [[BIOS]] for the human brain. According to characters in the book, the goddess [[Asherah]] is the personification of a linguistic virus similar to a computer virus. The god [[Enki]] created a counter program which he called a [[nam-shub]] that caused all of humanity to speak different languages as a protection against Asherah, supposedly giving rise to the biblical story of the [[Tower of Babel]].
* In ''[[Story of Your Life]]'', by [[Ted Chiang]], learning the written language used by alien visitors to the Earth allows the person who learns the language to think in a different way, in which the past and future are illusions of conventional thought. This allows people who understand the language to see their entire life as a single unchangeable action, from past to future.
* In ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], Valentine Michael Smith is able to do things that most other humans cannot, and is unable to explain any of this in English. However, once others learn Martian, they start to develop the ability to do these things; those concepts could be explained only in Martian.
* ''[[The Unnamable (short story)|The Unnamable]]'', by [[H.P. Lovecraft]], explores the idea of whether or not someone can conceptualize something which cannot be described by any name.
* In ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], the author discovers references in books to a universe of idealistic individuals whose languages have peculiarities that shape their idealism. For example, one of the language families lacks nouns, while another primarily uses monosyllabic adjectives to describe objects. As the story progresses the books become more and better known to the world at large, their philosophy starts influencing the real world, and Earth becomes the ideal world described in the books.

====Counterexamples====
* In ''[[The Citadel of the Autarch]]'', by [[Gene Wolfe]], one of the characters (an Ascian) speaks entirely in slogans, but is able to express deep and subtle meanings via context. The narrator, Severian, after hearing the Ascian speak, remarks that "The Ascian seemed to speak only in sentences he had learned by rote, though until he used each for the first time we had never heard them ... Second, I learned how difficult it is to eliminate the urge for expression.

{{unreferenced|date=May 2009}}
'''explodingdog''' is the name of a [[web site]] run by [[Sam Brown (artist)|Sam Brown]], pseudonym of Adam Culbert. From 2000 to 2015, viewers e-mailed Brown short phrases for inspiration and he illustrated certain ones.  The drawings are usually rendered digitally and are known for their simplistic style, and their poignant and sometimes unexpected take on the phrases on which they are based.

==History==
explodingdog was started in 2000.

Sam Brown has published limited-run print books of his explodingdog illustrations.  He also sells merchandise with explodingdog illustrations and prints of the daily drawings to help offset costs.

==Themes and Visual Motifs==
Like many artists, Sam Brown uses many recurring themes and visual motifs in his explodingdog work.

'''Food for the Hungry''' (also known as FH) is an international relief and development organization with operations in more than 20 countries. Food for the Hungry was founded in 1971 by Dr. Larry Ward.&lt;ref name="ECFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfa.org/MemberProfile.aspx?ID=5160 |title=Food for the Hungry (Accredited Organization Profile) |publisher=ECFA.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food for the Hungry's stated mission is "to walk with leaders, churches and families in overcoming all forms of human poverty by living in healthy relationship with [[God]] and His creation"&lt;ref name="Vision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/about/vision |title=About &amp;#124; Vision and Mission &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which was taken from [[Book of Psalms]] 146:7 He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. Food for the Hungry is a charter member of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]], since February 1, 1980.&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt;

== History ==
Larry Ward founded the organization in 1971, with offices in [[Southern California]]. He moved the offices to [[Arizona]] in 1974. Early projects included helping [[refugees]] in war-torn [[Bangladesh]], victims of the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake]], rescuing Vietnamese "[[boat people]]" from the [[South China Sea]], and helping hungry and needy people in [[Haiti]] and West Africa. The child sponsorship program was started in 1978. Hunger Corps, the people-sending division of Food for the Hungry, began in 1979.

Dr. Larry Ward retired as president of both the U.S. fundraising office and the international implementation arm of Food for the Hungry in 1984. He was succeeded by [[Ted Yamamori]], Ph.D. As a young child, Yamamori had his own near-starvation experience at the end of [[World War II]] in [[Japan]]. He survived, thanks to the kindness of strangers. Dr. Yamamori retired in 2001, at which point two people were hired to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/feeding-the-hungry|title=Feeding the Hungry Dr. Tetsunao Yamamori &amp; Food for the Hungry|publisher=Mission Frontiers|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Randall Hoag was appointed president of Food for the Hungry International, and Benjamin K. Homan was appointed president of Food for the Hungry/U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/food-for-the-hungry-phoenix-officials-assess-relief-programs-in-indonesia-15685/ |title=Food For The Hungry, Phoenix Officials Assess Relief Programs in Indonesia |publisher=Global.christianpost.com |date=2005-05-18 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, FH has consolidated its U.S. and international operations, led by President/CEO Gary Edmonds.

=== Evolution of FH's work ===
When Larry Ward founded FH, it was the result of his hurting heart for the 12,000 children who were then dying of hunger related causes.&lt;ref name="Policy Innovations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/innovations/data/food_hungry |title=The Food for the Hungry Story |publisher=Policyinnovations.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant relief theory of the day was that poverty was caused by a lack of resources, so providing resources was the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://askquestions.tv/category/speakers/keith-wright/ |title=Keith Wright - Redux |publisher=Askquestions.tv |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward left his position as executive vice president and overseas director at [[World Vision]] in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/world-vision-international-inc |title=World Vision International, Inc.: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and headed out to help impoverished people by taking to Haiti resources he had purchased with his personal credit card.&lt;ref name="Policy Innovations" /&gt;

FH's first official response was to help returnees of war in the newly forming nation of [[Bangladesh]] (formerly [[East Pakistan]]) in 1971. The focus on relief operations continued into the late 1970s, although many of those countries became areas where FH helped the people recover through long-term development projects.

'''Disaster Responses that became Development Areas in 1970s'''

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! Year !! Location !! Disaster
|-
| 1971 || Bangladesh || Returnees of war
|-
| 1972 || Nicaragua || Earthquake victims
|-
| 1976 || Kenya || Drought victims
|-
| 1976 || Guatemala || Earthquake victims
|-
| 1978 || Philippines || Refugees of war
|-
| 1979 || Dominican Republic || Hurricane victims
|}

Beginning in 1978, FH began to more intentionally increase its development work. This is when FH first began working in countries without first responding to a humanitarian disaster, through its [[child sponsorship]] program. The child sponsorship&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt; program was launched in 1978 in [[Bolivia]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Philippines]]. Additional fields that were added in the 1980s included [[Peru]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Uganda]].

'''Growth of Development Areas in the 1980s'''

| FH Peru || Child Development
|-
| FH Ethiopia || [[Drought]] victims
|-
| FHDR || Haiti border
|-
| FH Mozambique || Civil war victims
|-
| FH Uganda || AIDS &amp; Civil war victims
|}

Throughout the early 1990s, a greater emphasis on the community began to emerge as the focus for development. At the same time, conflicts such as [[terrorism]], [[genocide]] and communist rebel activity were on the rise. FH developed a concise set of development principles focused on transforming communities by working closely with the churches, leaders and families. Over time, new and existing areas of operation would increasingly focus on addressing the whole of the community as an essential approach to serving the most vulnerable. Several fields of operation were added in the 1990s under this principle.

'''Growth of FH Relief and Development Areas in the early 1990s'''

|-

|-

|}

The first ten years of the 21st century would prove to be challenging yet provide new opportunities to adapt to developing global realities. Challenges came through several major emergencies that were added to the ongoing issues of hunger, poverty, HIV/AIDS and war.&lt;ref name="Fex profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fex.ennonline.net/5/agencyprofile |title=Food for the Hungry &amp;#124; ENN |publisher=Fex.ennonline.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Development Areas in the 2000s'''

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-

|-
| 2001 || FH [[South Sudan]] || Post-conflict response
|-
| 2004 || FH Indonesia || Tsunami response
|-
| 2007 || FH [[Burundi]] || Emergency response
|-
| 2009 || FH Haiti || HIV and disaster response
|}

Beginning in 1997 FH began implementing the innovative model of Cascade Groups into their developmental structure and programming. They have since been considered a leader and expert in the facilitation of these groups through their diligence and successful execution.

Cascade Groups uses of the idea of [[social networking]] to work in communities. Within this model, groups of 10-15 community-based [[volunteering|volunteers]] educate their neighbors about health issues. The volunteer educators regularly meet together with FH staff for training and supervision. Each of the volunteers meets regularly with 10-15 of her neighbors to share what she has learned and to facilitate behavior change at the household level. This not only creates a multiplying effect, but it also provides the structure for a community health information system that reports on new pregnancies, births and deaths.

Since the Cascade Group model was first pioneered, it has been used by 20 (and counting) other Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) in more than 20 countries, largely through the support of the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]]. In particular, the USAID Child Survival and Health Grants Program and the USAID [[Food for Peace]] (Title II Food Security) Program have helped to fund programs using the Cascade Group model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caregroupinfo.org/blog/criteria |title=Definition &amp; Criteria |publisher=Care Group Info |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Implementation of Child-focused Community Transformation (CFCT) in the 2010s'''

FH developed the concept of CFCT between 2005 and 2011 and officially launched CFCT as a unified model for community transformation with child-focused outcomes at the center of field implementation and the organization's strategic plan. Since September 2011, CFCT has formed the base of all Food for the Hungry program models. A core component of Food for the Hungry's mission is to "focus on the most vulnerable," with children believed to be the most prominent and vulnerable members of the communities Food for the Hungry serves. Child-focused does not mean that all development activity is centered solely on children, since children are supported and cared for by their families and community leaders. Therefore, the majority of CFCT activities are focused on strengthening families, the church, and community leaders. "Transformation" encompasses the process of radical change in behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and worldviews of individuals, communities, and cultures toward living in healthy relationship with God, others, themselves, and creation (Four Key Relationships).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myers|first1=Bryant L.|title=Walking with the poor : principles and practices of transformational development|date=2011|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, N.Y.|isbn=978-1570759390}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "transformational development" refers to the work that Food for the Hungry staff and community members do to achieve mutual transformation and advance and accelerate measurable well-being improvements for the most vulnerable.

=== Organizational Structure ===
Food for the Hungry, Inc. (FH/US) was incorporated by Larry Ward in the United States in 1971 and has existed continuously since then. Ward incorporated Food for the Hungry International (FHI) in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, in 1980. FHI was part of Ward's dream to implement unified relief and development programs worldwide through an international partnership of supporting national organizations (NOs) or affiliates.

FH/US became a supporting NO for FHI, along with like NOs in Japan (established in 1981), [[Canada]] (established in 1988), [[Sweden]] (established in 1988), [[Switzerland]] (established in 1988), [[Korea]] (established in 1989), [[United Kingdom]] (established in 1989) and a second organization in the United States, Korea-American Food for the Hungry International (established in 2002).&lt;ref name="Fex profile" /&gt;

In 2006, FH restructured to align operations with NOs in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States as members of FH Association (FHA), which was registered in Switzerland in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/food-hungry-association-fh |title=Food for the Hungry Association (FH) &amp;#124; GPPlatform |publisher=Gpplatform.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan and Korea aligned as Food for the Hungry International Federation (FHF) and, though loosely affiliated as members of a larger FHI "family," operate separately from FHA.&lt;ref&gt;https://vocf.net/uploaded_project/fhifdir07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

FH is the umbrella for all FHA NOs and relief and development fields. Field work occurs primarily in Asia, Africa, Central America, South America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/work/countries |title=Work &amp;#124; Countries &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; NOs support this work by raising funds, supplying human resources and helping to design and evaluate field programs.

FH is governed by a unified Board of Directors providing direct oversight of FHA and FH/US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/about/leadership/board |title=Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is led by President/CEO Gary Edmonds.

== Biblical Holism ==

A [[Christian worldview|biblical worldview]] is both a foundation and umbrella for FH's work. Food for the Hungry's Statement of Faith&lt;ref name="Vision" /&gt; corresponds to the Statement of Faith of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] (NAE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nae.net/about-us/statement-of-faith |title=Statement of Faith |publisher=Nae.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FH functions on the belief that poverty is the result of broken relationships: (1) between humans and humans, (2) between humans and creation and (3) between humans and God,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fh.org/2012/08/biblical-worldview/ |title=Biblical Worldview: Both a Foundation and an Umbrella - Food for the Hungry Blog |publisher=Blog.fh.org |date=2012-08-17 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that restoring these relationships in a holistic way is the key to overcoming poverty.

FH is not affiliated with any specific church or denomination, and its work is available to the world's most vulnerable people, regardless of race, gender or religion. While staff do not proselytize (use religious coercion or require a beneficiary to listen to a religious message before receiving help), biblical values infuse FH programs by promoting concepts that mend the broken relationships that result in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/organizations/food-for-the-hungry |title=Food for the Hungry |publisher=Berkleycenter.georgetown.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global FH partnership is committed to transformational development. This requires walking with churches, leaders and families to help them identify and overcome the issues that lock them in poverty. One of these issues is fatalistic worldviews that steal people's hope.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130215215831/http://dinkumfiles.com/2009/07/07/eastern-university-to-host-transformational-development-conference-august-7th-9th/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many organizations acknowledge that faith can be vital in development, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/partnership-opportunities/faith-based-community-organizations/history |title=Partnership Opportunities &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2014-07-18 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Heartbeat ===
In 2014, Food for the Hungry created a revised version of their "Vision, Mission, and Values" called "The Heartbeat of FH." The heartbeat is the values and principles that guide and shape the organization and is composed of values, vision, and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fh.org/about/values-vision-purpose/|title=FH Values, Mission, and Purpose|last=|first=|date=|website=Food for the Hungry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Values'''
# We follow Jesus. ''We are ambassadors of Jesus in our thoughts, words, and deeds''.
# Our work is relational. ''We pursue reconciled relationships of grace with those with whom we work, partner, and serve.'' 
# We invest wisely and focus on results. ''We are stewards in God's kingdom and strive to invest all resources to maximize missional impact.'' 
# We serve with humility. ''We recognize the dignity of others and put their interests above our own.''
# We pursue beauty, goodness, and truth. ''We pursue beauty, goodness, and truth.'' 
'''Vision'''

''All forms of human poverty ended worldwide.''

'''Purpose'''

''Together we follow God's call responding to human suffering and graduating communities from extreme poverty.''

== Examples of International Impact ==

=== The Democratic Republic of the Congo ===
FH installed a community water pump in Kamalenge. The community uses the water pump for farming and personal use. Since installation, the water management committee in Kamalenge has managed the water pump. FH also helped families in [[Kateba]] learn about health and nutrition through songs and flipcharts. Villages that FH was able to work in are now free of malnutrition. FH also helped to build a seed multiplication station in Emilingombre so farmers would have more direct access to seeds and seedlings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.usaid.gov/2012/08/a-lasting-impact-on-food-security/ |title=A Lasting Impact on Food Security &amp;#124; USAID Impact |publisher=Blog.usaid.gov |date=2012-08-07 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, when [[Hurricane Isaac (2012)]] hit [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], FH staff helped families who lost homes, animals and crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/when-the-spotlight-on-disasters-fade-the-work-goes-on-11820/ |title=When the Spotlight on Disasters Fade, the Work Goes on &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethiopia ===
Among several other countries, Food for the Hungry offers child sponsorships to children in [[Ethiopia]]. Sponsoring children in Ethiopia provides children with food, medical care, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/bringing-hope-to-the-hard-places-11847// |title=Bringing Hope to the Hard Places &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, FH reached approximately 84,652 households in Ethiopia. In addition to their work with families, FH helped 180,456 farmers improve access to markets due to road construction and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Foodaid"&gt;[http://foodaid.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Food-for-Peace-Mozambique-DRC-Ethiopia-Food-for-the-Hungry.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722232838/http://foodaid.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Food-for-Peace-Mozambique-DRC-Ethiopia-Food-for-the-Hungry.pdf |date=July 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republic of Mozambique ===
Food for the Hungry worked in Mozambique to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality – especially among children 0–23 months of age and pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caregroupinfo.org/docs/FH_Final_Eval_Report_27Dec2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, FH helped develop 182 Farmer Field and Life Groups in Mozambique with 3,276 people receiving services. Their efforts have helped impact approximately 111,000 people.&lt;ref name="Foodaid" /&gt;
FH's Mozambique Child Survival Project was called one of the world's best examples of what can be achieved at low cost to improve the health of children in high-mortality, low-resource settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry B.

== Funding ==
FH is a charter member in good standing of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA).&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt; Their audited financial statement for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013 shows that 35 percent of funding came from the U.S. government, 62 percent from individuals, 3 percent from churches, businesses, and foundations. Of this funding, 83 percent was used on programs, 11 percent on fundraising and 6 percent on administrative costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/fh_us/docs/2011_annual_report_sm?mode=window&amp;backgroundColor=%23222222 |title=Food for the Hungry 2011 Annual Report by Food for the Hungry |publisher=ISSUU |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
In 2012, Food for the Hungry was one of hundreds of non-profits chosen by the [[IRS]] for a routine audit of their tax return for 2007. They cooperated fully with the IRS. A preliminary letter listed several issues that IRS wanted to clarify. That letter was illegally leaked to the media, launching a media controversy over unconfirmed facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/gik |title=Gifts-in-Kind &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Food for the Hungry received a letter from the IRS. The letter accepted the tax return as originally submitted, and acknowledged that Food for the Hungry had followed all laws and accepted accounting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wayback Machine|url=https://www.fh.org/images/general/docs/IRS_Audit_Closing_Release_final.pdf|website=www.fh.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505182100/https://www.fh.org/images/general/docs/IRS_Audit_Closing_Release_final.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As charter members of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]], Food for the Hungry are in compliance with their Seven Standards of Responsible Stewardship. In addition, the organization has received [https://www.guidestar.org/profile/95-2680390 GuideStar's Platinum Seal of Transparency], which is the highest level of recognition offered by Guidestar to non-profits and charities. 

There are no outstanding issues concerning Food for the Hungry's involvement in issues with the IRS.

== Accomplishments ==
Food for the Hungry's HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities previously were smaller projects compared to its food distribution and development programs. In 2005, FH was awarded an $8.3 million grant through the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) to expand its prevention programs in [[Ethiopia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mozambique]] and Haiti. This grant is part of a $100-million pool of PEPFAR abstinence funds awarded by USAID through its [[Abstinence]] and Healthy Choices for Youth program in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marina Walker Guevaraemail |url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/2006/11/30/6400/food-hungry |title=Food for the Hungry &amp;#124; Center for Public Integrity |publisher=Publicintegrity.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Davis, formerly Chief Program Officer for FH, developed the Barrier Analysis methodology earlier in his career and was a pioneer of the Care Group model, which empowers volunteer peer educators to promote life saving behaviors with mothers at the community level. In 2012, while working with FH, his work earned him the [[American Public Health Association]] Gordon-Wyon Award for Excellence in Community-Oriented Public Health, Epidemiology and Practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apha.org/membergroups/sections/aphasections/intlhealth/cbphcw/activities/Gordon+Wyon+Awards.htm |title=Gordon Wyon Awards |publisher=APHA |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[David Evans (administrator)|David Evans]], then U.S. President of Food for the Hungry spoke at the 2012 Faith Suc   vg ncv   n   mmit on AIDS in [[Washington, DC]]. They were recognized for their volunteer efforts like transporting water, washing clothes, bathing those in need, counseling, and praying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/faith-summit-on-aids-receives-accolades-11034/ |title=Faith Summit on AIDS Receives Accolades &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==

=== Sports Initiatives ===
In the 2010s, Food for the Hungry began partnering with several [[Major League Baseball]] players and cultural icons. This culminated in the creation of two sports campaigns, Striking Out Poverty in 2016, which partners with players in the [[MLB]], and FH Champions in 2017, which focuses on partnerships with players in the [[National Football League|NFL]]. Striking Out Poverty (also known as "K Poverty" or "SOP") began with a focus on ending poverty in nine communities in the [[Dominican Republic]], where baseball is the national sport and more than 500 baseball players in the MLB hail from the Dominican Republic. Food for the Hungry's Global Ambassador is [[Roberto Clemente Jr.|Roberto Clemente Jr]]., a former pro baseball player and son of [[Roberto Clemente]], the first Latin American player to compile 3,000 hits in Major League Baseball history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fh.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Roberto-Clemente-Jr-Ambassador.pdf|title=Food for the Hungry Names Roberto Clemente Jr. Global Ambassador|last=|first=|date=March 16, 2017|work=Food for the Hungry|access-date=2017-11-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other athletes who have participated in Striking Out Poverty campaigns and vision trips include [[Nick Ahmed]], [[Chase Anderson]], [[Dee Gordon]], [[Yasmani Grandal]], [[Liam Hendriks]], [[Starling Marte]], [[Gregory Polanco]], [[Rob Refsnyder]], [[Moisés Sierra]], [[Adam Wainwright]], and [[Luke Weaver (baseball)|Luke Weaver]]. NFL athletes who have worked with Food for the Hungry formerly as "Pro Player Partners" or as part of Champions by FH include [[Jarvis Jenkins]], [[Jonathan Meeks]], [[Derrick Morgan (American football)|Derrick Morgan]], [[Coty Sensabaugh]], and [[Michael Thomas (defensive back)|Michael Thomas]].

=== Artists and Influencers ===
Food for the Hungry also partners with Christian artists and influencers including [[TobyMac]], [[Lecrae]], [[Switchfoot]], [[Third Day]] and more as part of its Artists Program to promote Food for the Hungry at their concerts and events around the country. Each artists sponsors his or her own child with Food for the Hungry as part of their shared God-given mission with FH to end extreme poverty.

[[Image:Forcefeeding.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[suffragette]] is force-fed in [[Holloway (HM Prison)|HM Prison Holloway]] in the UK during [[hunger strike]]s for [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name=Pankhurst433&gt;{{cite book |last=Pankhurst |first=Emmeline |authorlink=Emmeline Pankhurst |title=The Suffragette |year=1911 |location=New York |publisher=Sturgis &amp; Walton Company |page=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Force-feeding''' is the practice of feeding a human or other animal against their will. The term "'''gavage'''" ({{IPAc-en|pron|ɡ|ə|ˈ|v|ɑː|ʒ}}) refers to supplying a nutritional substance by means of a small plastic [[feeding tube]] passed through the nose ([[nasogastric tube|nasogastric]]) or mouth (orogastric) into the stomach. In hospitals, some psychiatric patients can be restrained so sedatives can be injected into them; this happens if patients have been non-compliant with their instructions.

== Of humans ==
Soviet dissident [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] described how he was force-fed: "The feeding pipe was thick, thicker than my nostril, and would not go in. Blood came gushing out of my nose and tears down my cheeks, but they kept pushing until the cartilages cracked. I guess I would have screamed if I could, but I could not with the pipe in my throat. I could breathe neither in nor out at first; I wheezed like a drowning man &amp;mdash; my lungs felt ready to burst. The doctor also seemed ready to burst into tears, but she kept shoving the pipe farther and farther down. Only when it reached my stomach could I resume breathing, carefully. Then she poured some slop through a funnel into the pipe that would choke me if it came back up. They held me down for another half-hour so that the liquid was absorbed by my stomach and could not be vomited back, and then began to pull the pipe out bit by bit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Daily Kos]]: [http://fenwaysteve.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/12/18/19365/937 "The WaPo prints a torture story."]&lt;/ref&gt;

"The unfortunate patients had their mouth clamped shut, had a rubber tube inserted into their mouth or nostril. They keep on pressing it down until it reaches your esophagus. A china funnel is attached to the other end of the tube and a cabbage-like mixture poured down the tube and through to the stomach. This was an unhealthy practice, as the food might have gone into their lungs and caused [[pneumonia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/ |title=Guidelines for Physicians Concerning Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in Relation to Detention and Imprisonment |website=wma.net |publisher=[[World Medical Association]] |access-date=12 December 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In prisons ===
Some countries force-feed prisoners when they go on [[hunger strike]]. It has been prohibited since 1975 by the [[Declaration of Tokyo]] of the [[World Medical Association]], provided that the prisoner is "capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgment". The violation of this prohibition may be carried out in a manner that can be categorised as [[torture]], as it may be extremely painful and result in severe bleeding and spreading of various diseases via the exchanged blood and mucus, especially when conducted with dirty equipment on a prison population.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]]: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4569626.stm "UN concern at Guantanamo feeding."]&lt;/ref&gt; Large feeding pipes are traditionally used on hunger striking prisoners&lt;ref  name=BostonGlobe2005-12-30/&gt; whereas thin pipes are preferred in hospitals.

[[Image:Djuna Barnes Clipping.jpg|thumb|left|Clipping from ''World Magazine'', September 6, 1914]]

[[Suffragettes]] who had been imprisoned while campaigning for [[votes for women]] went on hunger strike and were force fed. (This lasted until the [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act]] of 1913, better known as the Cat and Mouse Act, whereby debilitated prisoners would be released, allowed to recover, and then re-arrested.) Rubber tubes were inserted through the mouth (only occasionally through the nose) and into the stomach, and food poured down; the suffragettes were held down by force while the instruments were inserted into their bodies, an experience which has been likened to [[rape]].&lt;ref&gt;Purvis, June; ''Emmeline Pankhurst'', London: Routledge, p 134, {{ISBN|0-415-23978-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a smuggled letter, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] described how the warders held her down and forced her mouth open with a steel gag. Her gums bled, and she vomited most of the liquid up afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Pugh (author)|Pugh, Martin]]; ''The Pankhursts'', UK: Penguin Books, 2001, p 259, {{ISBN|0-14-029038-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmeline Pankhurst]], founder of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]], was horrified by the screams of women being force-fed in [[Holloway (HM Prison)|HM&amp;nbsp;Prison Holloway]]. She wrote: "Holloway became a place of horror and torment. Sickening scenes of violence took place almost every hour of the day, as the doctors went from cell to cell performing their hideous office. …I shall never while I live forget the suffering I experienced during the days when those cries were ringing in my ears." When prison officials tried to enter her cell, Pankhurst, in order to avoid being force-fed, raised a clay jug over her head and announced: "If any of you dares so much as to take one step inside this cell I shall defend myself."&lt;ref name=Pankhurst252&gt;{{cite book |last=Pankhurst |first=Emmeline |authorlink=Emmeline Pankhurst |title=My Own Story |year=1914 |location=London |publisher=Virago Limited (1979) |ISBN=0-86068-057-6 |pages=251 &amp; 252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, [[Frances Parker]], another suffragette, was being force-fed by the rectum in the Perth prison: "Thursday morning, 16th July ... the three wardresses appeared again.   One of them said that if I did not resist, she would send the others away and do what she had come to do as gently and as decently as possible.   I consented.   This was another attempt to feed me by the rectum, and was done in a cruel way, causing me great pain.   She returned some time later and said she had ‘something else’ to do.   I took it to be another attempt to feed me in the same way, but it proved to be a grosser and more indecent outrage, which could have been done for no other purpose than torture.   It was followed by soreness, which lasted for several days."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Djuna Barnes]], the American journalist, agreed to submit to force-feeding for a 1914 ''[[New York World]]'' magazine article. Barnes wrote, "If I, play acting, felt my being burning with revolt at this brutal usurpation of my own functions, how they who actually suffered the ordeal in its acutest horror must have flamed at the violation of the sanctuaries of their spirits." She concluded, "I had shared the greatest experience of the bravest of my sex."&lt;ref&gt; Mills, Eleanor; with Kira Cochrane (eds.) (2005). Journalistas: 100 Years of the Best Writing and Reporting by Women Journalists. New York: Carroll &amp; Graf. {{ISBN|0-7867-1667-3}}. p 163–166.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The United Kingdom also used forcible feeding techniques against [[Irish Republicans]] during their struggle for independence. In 1917 Irish prisoner [[Thomas Ashe]] died as a result of complications from such a feeding while incarcerated at [[Dublin]]'s [[Mountjoy Prison|Mountjoy Jail]]. The outrage of Ashe's  death from the Irish public was so great that force feeding has never been used in Ireland again since.&lt;ref name=CcrHungerStrikes2002-2005&gt;

==== United Nations War Crimes Tribunal====
On December 6, 2006, the [[United Nations War Crimes Tribunal]] at [[The Hague]] approved the use of force-feeding of [[Serbia]]n politician [[Vojislav Šešelj]]. They decided it was not "torture, inhuman or degrading treatment if there is a medical necessity to do so... and if the manner in which the detainee is force-fed is not inhuman or degrading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/yugo/article/0,,1966016,00.html | title=War crimes tribunal orders force-feeding of Serbian warlord | date=December 7, 2006 | publisher=The Guardian| accessdate = 2007-09-16 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Traynor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel====
In 2015, the [[Knesset]] passed a law allowing the force-feeding of prisoners in response to a hunger strike by a Palestinian detainee who had been held for months in [[administrative detention]].  Israel doctors refused to feed Mohammad Allan against his will, and he resumed eating after the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] temporarily released him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/08/22/433587857/hunger-strike-raises-debate-about-force-feeding-in-israeli-prisons| title=Hunger Strike Raises Debate About Force-Feeding In Israeli Prisons |date=22 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other forms====
Force-feeding of pernicious substances may be used as a form of [[torture]] and/or [[physical punishment]]. While in prison in northern Bosnia in 1996, some Serbian prisoners have described being forced to eat paper and soap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/serb-prisoners-forced-to-eat-soap-during-months-of-beatings-in-solita-ry-confinement-1344790.html?printService=print |title= Serb prisoners 'forced to eat soap' during months of beatings in solitary confinement |work= [[The Independent]] |location=London |date= 30 March 1996 |first= Lynne Reid |last= Banks |authorlink= Lynne Reid Banks }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes it has been alleged that prisoners are forced to eat foods forbidden by their religion. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' has reported that Muslim prisoners in [[Abu Ghraib prison]] under the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|U.S.-led coalition]] described in sworn statements having been forced to eat pork and drink alcohol, both of which are strictly [[haraam|forbidden in Islam]] (see [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43783-2004May20.html | work=The Washington Post | title=New Details of Prison Abuse Emerge | date=2004-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Of babies===
[[File:'Gavage' method of infant feeding used in France. Wellcome L0001803.jpg|thumb|'Gavage' method of infant feeding used in France, late 19th century]]
According to ''Infant feeding by artificial means: a scientific and practical treatise on the dietetics of infancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sadler|first1=S H|title=Infant feeding by artificial means: a scientific and practical treatise on the dietetics of infancy|date=1896|location=London|page=18|edition=2nd|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', a French system of feeding newborn or premature babies who could not suckle was known as ''gavage''. Sadler dates its origin to 1874 and quotes [[Étienne Stéphane Tarnier]], a pioneer perinatologist, describing the procedure. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sadler|first1=S H|date=1896|edition=2nd|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For girls before marriage===
{{Main|Leblouh}}
Force-feeding used to be practiced in the [[North Africa]] and still is in [[Mauritania]]. Fatness was considered a marriage asset in women; culturally, [[voluptuous]] figures were perceived as indicators of wealth. In this tradition, some girls are forced by their mothers or grandmothers to overeat, often accompanied by [[physical punishment]] (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;pressing a finger between two pieces of wood) should the girl not eat. The intended result is a rapid onset of [[obesity]], and the practice may start at a young age and continue for years.  This is still the tradition in the rather undernourished [[Sahel]] country [[Mauritania]] (where it is called [[leblouh]]), where it induces major health risks in the female population; some younger men no longer insist on voluptuous brides, but traditional beauty norms remain part of the culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0711/p04s01-woaf.html "Women rethink a big size that is beautiful but brutal"] Clare Soares 11 July 2006.

===In slavery===
Slaves who tried to [[suicide|commit suicide]] by starving themselves were force fed with a contraption called the ''speculum orum''. This device forced the slave's mouth open in order to be fed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p277.html|title=Africans in America/Part 1/The Middle Passage|website=www.pbs.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Of domestic animals ==
[[File:Hyena-forcefeed.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Ancient Egyptian]] force-feeding a [[hyena]]]]  
Force-feeding has been used to prepare animals for slaughter.  In some cases, such as is the case with geese raised for [[foie gras]], it is still practiced today.

=== In farming ===
{{Main|Foie gras}}
[[Image:Mulard duck being force fed corn in order to fatten its liver for foie gras production.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Animal welfare]] groups object to force-feeding of birds. Here a [[Mulard duck]] is being force fed corn in order to fatten its liver for [[foie gras]] production.]]
Force-feeding is also known as gavage, from a French word meaning "to gorge". This term specifically refers to force-feeding of [[Domestic duck|ducks]] or [[Domestic goose|geese]] in order to fatten their livers in the production of [[foie gras]].
In modern [[Egypt]], the practice of fattening geese and male [[Muscovy duck]]s by force-feeding{{dubious|date=May 2014|reason=Are you sure tubes are inserted in their mouths?! Over-feeding is different from force-feeding.}} them various grains is present, mostly by individuals, unrelated to foie gras production, but for general consumption of those birds later. It is not widespread on commercial farms however. The term used for such a practice is called "Tazgheet" تزغيط from the verb "Zaghghat" زغَط.

Force-feeding of birds is practiced mostly on geese or male [[Mulard|Moulard ducks]], a Muscovy/Pekin hybrid.  Preparation for gavage usually begins 4–5 months before slaughter. For geese, after an initial free-range period and treatment to assist in esophagus dilation (eating grass, for example), the force-feeding commences. Gavage is performed 2–4 times a day for 2–5 weeks, depending on the size of the fowl, using a funnel attached to a slim metal or plastic feeding tube inserted into the bird's throat to deposit the food into the bird's [[crop (anatomy)|crop]] (the storage area in the esophagus). A grain mash, usually maize mixed with fats and vitamin supplements, is the feed of choice. Waterfowl are suited to the tube method due to a non-existent [[Vomiting|gag]] reflex and an extremely flexible esophagus, unlike other fowl such as [[chickens]]. These migratory waterfowl are also said to be ideal for gavage because of their natural ability to gain large amounts of weight in short periods of time before cold seasons.

[[Shen Dzu]] is a similar practice of force-feeding pigs.

===In scientific research===
Gavage is used in some scientific studies such as those involving the rate of metabolism.  It is practiced upon various [[laboratory animal]]s, such as mice. Liquids such as medicines may be administered to the animals via a tube or syringe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7122/abs/nature05414.htmlAn obesity-associated gut microbiome with increased capacity for energy harvest&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--If the artwork has a proper title, then it should be italicized here and in the title of the article above--&gt;'''''Free Basket''''' is a public artwork by the [[Cuba]]n artist group [[Los Carpinteros]], located in the [[100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park]], in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. The artwork is in the form of an international basketball court with twenty-four red or blue steel arches that travel throughout the court, mimicking the trajectory of two bouncing basketballs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art &amp; Nature Park|year=2010|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-936260-88-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the arches terminate with their own regulation size basketball hoop, netting, and backboard.

==Description==
''Free Basket'' is located outside the boundary of the 100 Acres park on city property.  The parking loop surrounding the artwork is situated just south of the Lake and west of the museum.  The artwork can be accessed by means of the IWC Canal Greenway (Central Canal Trail), W 38th Street, and the 100 Acres Park walkway.  ''Free Basket'' is a site-specific work consisting of twenty-four red- or blue-painted steel tubular arches that mimic the trajectory of two bouncing basketballs.  The arches travel throughout the court and are of varying heights and span widths.  Two of the arches (one red and one blue) are capped at midpoint, each with their own basketball backboard fashioned with: backboard, metal rim, and nylon net.  The steel arches have been mounted on a level, rectangular concrete surface that is size of an international basketball court, where they have been filled and secured with concrete cement.  The concrete court has been surfaced with Rhino Guard colored plastic and has been painted to the standards of an international basketball court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art &amp; Nature Park|year=2010|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-936260-88-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary court color is yellow, the “goal lines” are painted white, and sections of black and green flank both sides of the court, and a black border surrounds entire court.  There are also built-in lighting systems that have been sunk into the court to illuminate the sculpture.

==Historical information==
Los Carpinteros sought to portray the juxtaposition of the practical and the imaginary with ''Free Basket'', and drew on the history of sports in Indianapolis to merge art, sports, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ArtBabble: Play Art Loud|title=Los Carpinteros: In the Factory|url=http://www.artbabble.org/video/ima/los-carpinteros-factory|accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location history===
This artwork was installed at the IMA in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheets.|first=Hilarie M.|title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html|accessdate=2011-08-28|date=June 29, 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
''Free Basket'' has been acquired by the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].

==Condition==
In general, the artwork requires regular cleaning of both the steel and court components to discourage the buildup of damaging materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conserving Outdoor Sculpture: The Stark Collection at the Getty Center, Los Angeles, Getty Conservation Institute|year=2010|publisher=Getty Publications, Gregory M.

'''Frequency-dependent selection''' is an evolutionary process by which the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of a [[phenotype]] depends on its frequency relative to other phenotypes in a given [[population]].

* In '''positive''' frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a phenotype increases as it becomes more common.
* In '''negative''' frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a phenotype decreases as it becomes more common. This is an example of [[balancing selection]].

Frequency-dependent selection is usually the result of interactions between species (predation, parasitism, or competition), or between genotypes within species (usually competitive or symbiotic), and has been especially frequently discussed with relation to [[anti-predator adaptations]]. Frequency-dependent selection can lead to [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] equilibria, which result from interactions among genotypes within species, in the same way that multi-species equilibria require interactions between species in competition (e.g. where ''α''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; parameters in [[Lotka-Volterra]] competition equations are non-zero).

==Negative==
[[File:The anvil stone of a thrush - geograph.org.uk - 1751348.jpg|thumb|Anvil stone, where a thrush has broken open the shells of polymorphic [[grove snail]]s, may be a sign of frequency-dependent selection.]]

The first explicit statement of frequency-dependent selection appears to have been by [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] in 1884, on the way that predators could maintain color polymorphisms in their prey.&lt;ref&gt;Poulton, E. B. 1884. Notes upon, or suggested by, the colours, markings and protective attitudes of certain lepidopterous larvae and pupae, and of a phytophagous hymenopterous larva. Transactions of the Entomological Society of London 1884: 27–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Clarke | first2 = B.C. | year = 1984 | title = Frequency-dependent selection -- homage to Poulton, E.B | url = | journal = Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 15–18 | doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1984.tb00802.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best known early modern statement of the principle is [[Bryan Clarke]]'s 1962 paper on [[apostatic selection]] (a synonym of negative frequency-dependent selection).&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, B. 1962. Balanced polymorphism and the diversity of sympatric species. Pp. 47-70 in D. Nichols ed. Taxonomy and Geography. Systematics Association, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke discussed predator attacks on polymorphic British snails, citing [[Luuk Tinbergen]]'s classic work on [[searching image]]s as support that predators such as birds tended to specialize in common forms of palatable species.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, L. 1960. The natural control of insects in pinewoods. I. Factors influencing the intensity of predation in songbirds. Archs.Neerl.Zool. 13:265-343.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke later argued that frequency-dependent balancing selection could explain molecular polymorphisms (often in the absence of [[heterosis]]) in opposition to the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]].

Another example is [[plant self-incompatibility]] [[allele]]s. When two plants share the same incompatibility allele, they are unable to mate. Thus, a plant with a new (and therefore, rare) allele has more success at mating, and its allele spreads quickly through the population {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

In human pathogens, such as the [[flu]] virus, once a particular strain has become common, most individuals have developed an immune response to that strain. But a rare, novel strain of the flu virus is able to spread quickly to almost any individual, causing continual evolution of viral strains.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) is involved in the recognition of foreign antigens and cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Takahata | first1 = N. | last2 = Nei | first2 = M. | date = 1990 | title = Allelic genealogy under overdominant and frequency-dependent selection and polymorphism of major histocompatibility complex loci | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 124 | issue = | pages = 967–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequency-dependent selection may explain the high degree of polymorphism in the MHC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borghans | first1 = JA | last2 = Beltman | first2 = JB | last3 = De Boer | first3 = RJ. |date=Feb 2004 | title = MHC polymorphism under host-pathogen coevolution. | url = | journal = Immunogenetics | volume = 55 | issue = 11| pages = 732–9 | doi=10.1007/s00251-003-0630-5 | pmid=14722687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[behavioral ecology]], negative frequency-dependent selection often maintains multiple behavioral strategies within a species. A classic example is the Hawk-Dove model of interactions among individuals in a population. In a population with two traits A and B, being one form is better when most members are the other form.  As another example, male [[common side-blotched lizard]]s have three morphs, which either defend large territories and maintain large harems of females, defend smaller territories and keep one female, or mimic females in order to sneak matings from the other two morphs. These three morphs participate in a [[rock paper scissors]] sort of interaction such that no one morph completely outcompetes the other two.&lt;ref name="S&amp;L1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sinervo |first=B. |author2=C.M. Lively |date=1996 |title=The rock–paper–scissors game and the evolution of alternative male strategies |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6571 |pages=240–243 |doi=10.1038/380240a0|bibcode=1996Natur.380..240S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Setal2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sinervo |first=Barry |author2=Donald B.

==Positive==
[[File:Müllerian mimicry among Heliconius species.tiff|thumb|Müllerian mimetic species of ''Heliconius'' from South America]]

Positive frequency-dependent selection gives an advantage to common phenotypes. A good example is warning coloration in aposematic species.  Predators are more likely to remember a common color pattern that they have already encountered frequently than one that is rare. This means that new mutants or migrants that have color patterns other than the common type are eliminated from the population by differential predation.  Positive frequency-dependent selection provides the basis for Müllerian mimicry, as described by Fritz Müller &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Müller, F. |authorlink=Fritz Müller |year=1879 |title=Ituna and Thyridia; a remarkable case of mimicry in butterflies |journal=Proceedings of the Entomological Society of London |pages=20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;, because all species involved are aposematic and share the benefit of a common, honest signal to potential predators.

Another, rather complicated example occurs in the [[Batesian mimicry]] complex between a harmless mimic, the scarlet kingsnake (''[[Lampropeltis elapsoides]]''), and the model, the eastern coral snake (''[[Micrurus fulvius]]''), in locations where the model and mimic were in deep [[sympatry]], the [[phenotype]] of the scarlet kingsnake was quite variable due to relaxed selection. But where the pattern was rare, the predator population was not 'educated', so the pattern brought no benefit. The scarlet kingsnake was much less variable on the allopatry/sympatry border of the model and mimic, most probably due to increased selection since the eastern coral snake is rare, but present, on this border. Therefore, the coloration is only advantageous once it has become common.&lt;ref name="Harper 1955–1961"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harper |first=G. R. |author2=Pfennig, D. W. |title=Mimicry on the edge: why do mimics vary in resemblance to their model in different parts of their geographical range? |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=22 August 2007 |volume=274 |issue=1621 |pages=1955–1961 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0558 |pmid=17567563 |pmc=2275182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[engineering]], a '''function''' is interpreted as a specific [[process (engineering)|process]], action or [[Task analysis|task]] that a [[system]] is able to perform.&lt;ref&gt;R.Barker, C. Longman, Case Method: Function and Process Modelling, Addison-Wesley Professional, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In engineering design==

In the [[enterprise life cycle|lifecycle]] of engineering projects, there are usually distinguished subsequently: ''[[Requirements]]'' and ''[[Functional specification]]'' documents. The ''[[Requirement]]s'' usually specifies the most important attributes of the requested system. In the ''Design specification'' documents, physical or software processes and systems are frequently the requested functions

==In products==
For advertising and marketing of technical products, the number of functions they can perform is often counted and used for promotion. For example a [[calculator]] capable of the basic mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, would be called a "four-function" model; when other operations are added, for example for scientific, financial, or statistical calculations, advertisers speak of "57 scientific functions", etc. A wristwatch with stopwatch and timer facilities would similarly claim a specified number of functions. To maximise the claim, trivial operations which do not significantly enhance the functionality of a product may be counted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17854">'''Functional analytic psychotherapy''' ('''FAP''') is a [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] approach based on [[clinical behavior analysis]] (CBA) that focuses on the [[therapeutic relationship]] as a means to maximize client change. Specifically, FAP suggests that in-session [[Reinforcement|contingent responding]] to client target behaviors leads to significant therapeutic improvements.

FAP was first conceptualized in the 1980s by psychologists Robert Kohlenberg and Mavis Tsai who, after noticing a clinically significant association between client outcomes and the quality of the therapeutic relationship, set out to develop a theoretical model of [[behavioral psychotherapy]] based on these concepts. Behavioral principles (e.g., [[reinforcement]], generalization) form the basis of FAP.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlenberg, R. J., &amp; Tsai, M. (1991). Functional analytic psychotherapy: A guide for creating intense and curative therapeutic relationships. New York, NY: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsai&gt;Tsai, M., Kohlenberg, R. J., Kanter, J. W., Kohlenberg, B., Follette, W., &amp; Callaghan, G. (2009). A guide to functional analytic psychotherapy: Awareness, courage, love and behaviorism. New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; (See {{section link||The five rules}} below.)

FAP is an [[Nomothetic and idiographic|idiographic (as opposed to nomothetic)]] approach to psychotherapy. This means that FAP therapists focus on the ''function'' of a client's behavior instead of the ''form''. The aim is to change a broad class of behaviors that might look different on the surface but all serve the same function. It is idiographic in that the client and therapist work together to form a unique [[clinical formulation]] of the client's therapeutic goals, rather than one therapeutic target for every client who enters therapy.

==Basics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
FAP posits that client behaviors that occur in their out-of-session interpersonal relationships (i.e. in the "real world") will, if clients are given a therapeutic relationship of sufficiently high quality, occur in the therapy session as well. Based on these in-session behaviors, FAP therapists, in collaboration with their client, develop a [[case formulation]] that includes classes of behaviors (based on their function not their form) that the client wishes to increase and decrease.&lt;ref name=Tsai/&gt;

In-session occurrence of a client's problematic behavior is called ''clinically relevant behavior 1'' (CRB1). In-session occurrence of improvements is called ''clinically relevant behavior 2'' (CRB2). The goal of FAP therapy is to decrease the frequency of CRB1s and increase the frequency of CRB2s.

The FAP therapist evokes (i.e. sets the context for) CRB1s and in response gradually [[Shaping (psychology)|shapes]] CRB2s.

===The five rules===
"The five rules" operationalize the FAP therapist's behavior with respect to this goal. It is important to note that the five rules are not rules in the traditional sense of the word, but instead a set of guidelines for the FAP therapist.&lt;ref&gt;Tsai, M., Kohlenberg, R. J., Kanter, J. W., Waltz, J. (2009). Therapeutic technique: The five rules. In: M. Tsai, R. Kohlenberg, J. Kanter, B. Kohlenberg, W. Follette, G. Callaghan (Eds.) A guide to functional analytic psychotherapy: Awareness, courage, love, and behaviorism. (pp. 61–102). NY, Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Rule 1: Watch for CRBs''' – Therapists focus their attention on the occurrence of CRBs that are in-session problems (CRB1s) and improvements (CRB2s).
*'''Rule 2: Evoke CRBs''' – Therapists set a context which evoke the client's CRBs.
*'''Rule 3: Reinforce CRB2s naturally''' – Therapists reinforce the occurrence of CRB2s (in-session improvements), increasing the probability that these behaviors will occur more frequently.
*'''Rule 4: Observe therapist impact in relation to client CRBs''' – Therapists assess the degree to which they actually reinforced behavioral improvements by noting the client's behavior subsequent behavior after Rule 3. This is similar to the [[behavior analytic]] concept of performing a [[Functional analysis (psychology)|functional analysis]].
*'''Rule 5: Provide functional interpretations and generalize''' – Therapists work with the client to generalize in-session behavioral improvements to the client's out-of-session relationships. This can include, but is not limited to, providing [[Homework in psychotherapy|homework assignment]]s.

===The ACL model===
Researchers at the Center for the Science of Social Connection at the [[University of Washington]] are developing a model of social connection that they believe is relevant to FAP. This model – called the ACL model – delineates behaviors relevant to social connection based on decades of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Reis, H. T., &amp; Shaver, P. (1988). Intimacy as an interpersonal process In: S. Duck (Ed.), Handbook of personal relationships (pp. 367–389). Chichester, England: Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Awareness (A)''' behaviors include paying attention to your own and the other's needs and values within an interpersonal relationship.
*'''Courage (C)''' behaviors include experiencing emotion in the presence of another person, asking for what you need, and sharing deep, vulnerable experiences with another person in the service of improving the relationship.
*'''Love (L)''' behaviors involve responding to another's courage behaviors with attunement to what that person needs in the moment. These include providing safety and acceptance in response to a client's vulnerability.
FAP has the potential to target awareness, courage, and love behaviors as they occur in session as described by the five rules above. More research is needed to confirm the utility of the ACL model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jcbs.2014.02.001|title=Where is the love?

==Third generation behavior therapy==
FAP belongs to a group of therapies referred to as [[Behavior therapy#Third generation|third-generation behavior therapies]] (or third-wave behavior therapies) that includes [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), [[behavioral activation]] (BA), and [[integrative behavioral couples therapy]] (IBCT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = S. | last2 = Masuda | first2 = A. | last3 = Bissett | first3 = R. | last4 = Luoma | first4 = J. | last5 = Guerrero | first5 = L. | year = 2004 | title = DBT, FAR and ACT: How empirically oriented are the new behavior therapy technologies? | url = http://www.personal.kent.edu/~dfresco/CBT_Readings/ACT_FAP_%26_DBT_review.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Behavior Therapy | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 35–54 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(04)80003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{See also|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
FAP has been criticized for "being ahead of the data", i.e. having not enough empirical support to justify its widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Corrigan, P. W. (2001). "Getting ahead of the data: A threat to some behavior therapies". ''The Behavior Therapist'', 24, 189–193.&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges encountered by FAP researchers are widely discussed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Maitland, D. W. M., Gaynor, S. T.|year=2012|title=Promoting Efficacy Research on Functional Analytic Psychotherapy|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy|volume=7|issue=2–3|pages=63–71|doi=10.1037/h0100939|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bct/7/2-3/63.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Weeks, C.

There is also criticism of using the ACL model as it detracts from the idiographic nature of FAP.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{cite journal|authors=Darrow S. M., Follette W. C.|year=2014|title=Where's the beef?: Reply to Kanter, Holman, and Wilson|journal=Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science|volume=3|issue=4|pages=265–268|doi=10.1016/j.jcbs.2014.08.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12151">In [[functional programming]], a '''generalized algebraic data type''' ('''GADT''', also '''first-class phantom type''',{{sfn|Cheney|Hinze|2003}} '''guarded recursive datatype''',{{sfn|Xi|Chen|Chen|2003}} or '''equality-qualified type'''{{sfn|Sheard|Pasalic|2004}}) is a generalization of [[parametric polymorphism|parametric]] [[algebraic data type]]s.

== Overview ==
In a GADT, the product constructors (called [[data constructor]]s in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) can provide an explicit instantiation of the ADT as the type instantiation of their return value. This allows one to define functions with a more advanced type behaviour. For a data constructor of Haskell 98, the return value has the type instantiation implied by the instantiation of the ADT parameters at the constructor's application.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
-- A parametric ADT that is not a GADT
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)

integers = Cons 12 (Cons 107 Nil)       -- the type of integers is List Int
strings = Cons "boat" (Cons "dock" Nil) -- the type of strings is List String

-- A GADT
data Expr a where
    EBool  :: Bool     -&gt; Expr Bool
    EInt   :: Int      -&gt; Expr Int
    EEqual :: Expr Int -&gt; Expr Int  -&gt; Expr Bool

eval :: Expr a -&gt; a

eval e = case e of
    EBool a    -&gt; a
    EInt a     -&gt; a
    EEqual a b -&gt; (eval a) == (eval b)

expr1 = EEqual (EInt 2) (EInt 3)        -- the type of expr1 is Expr Bool
ret = eval expr1                        -- ret is False
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

They are currently implemented in the [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]] compiler as a non-standard extension, used by, among others, [[Pugs (programming)|Pugs]] and [[Darcs]]. [[OCaml]] supports GADT natively since version 4.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OCaml 4.00.1|url=https://ocaml.org/releases/4.00.1.html|website=ocaml.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GHC implementation provides support for existentially quantified type parameters and for local constraints.

== History ==
An early version of generalized algebraic data types were described by {{harvtxt|Augustsson|Petersson|1994}} and based on [[pattern matching (functional programming)|pattern matching]] in [[ALF (theorem prover)|ALF]].

Generalized algebraic data types were introduced independently by {{harvtxt|Cheney|Hinze|2003}} and prior by {{harvtxt|Xi|Chen|Chen|2003}} as extensions to [[ML (programming language)|ML]]'s and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]'s [[algebraic data type]]s.{{sfn|Cheney|Hinze|2003|p=25}} Both are essentially equivalent to each other. They are similar to the ''[[Algebraic data type|inductive families of data types]]'' (or ''inductive datatypes'') found in [[Coq]]'s [[Calculus of Inductive Constructions]] and other [[dependently typed language]]s, modulo the dependent types and except that the latter have an additional [[positivity restriction]] which is not enforced in GADTs.{{sfn|Cheney|Hinze|2003|pp=25–26}}

{{harvtxt|Sulzmann|Wazny|Stuckey|2006}} introduced ''extended algebraic data types'' which combine GADTs together with the [[existential type|existential data types]] and [[type class]] constraints introduced by {{harvtxt|Perry|1991}}, {{harvtxt|Läufer|Odersky|1994}} and {{harvtxt|Läufer|1996}}.

[[Type inference]] in the absence of any programmer supplied [[type annotation]]s is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]]{{sfn|Peyton Jones|Washburn|Weirich|2004|p=7}} and functions defined over GADTs do not admit [[principal type]]s in general.{{sfn|Schrijvers|Peyton Jones|Sulzmann|Vytiniotis|2009|p=1}} [[Type reconstruction]] requires several design trade-offs and is an area of active research ({{harvnb|Peyton Jones|Washburn|Weirich|2004}}; {{harvnb|Peyton Jones|Vytiniotis|Weirich|Washburn|2006}}; {{harvnb|Pottier|Régis-Gianas|2006}}; {{harvnb|Sulzmann|Schrijvers|Stuckey|2006}}; {{harvnb|Simonet|Pottier|2007}}; {{harvnb|Schrijvers|Peyton Jones|Sulzmann|Vytiniotis|2009}}; {{harvnb|Lin|Sheard|2010a}}; {{harvnb|Lin|Sheard|2010b}}; {{harvnb|Vytiniotis|Peyton Jones|Schrijvers|2010}}; {{harvnb|Vytiniotis|Peyton Jones|Schrijvers|Martin Sulzmann|2011}}).

== Applications ==
Applications of GADTs include [[generic programming]], modelling programming languages ([[higher-order abstract syntax]]), maintaining [[invariant (computer science)|invariant]]s in [[data structure]]s, expressing constraints in [[embedded domain-specific language]]s, and modelling objects.{{sfn|Peyton Jones|Washburn|Weirich|2004|p=3}}

=== Higher-order abstract syntax ===
{{further|Higher-order abstract syntax}}
An important application of GADTs is to embed [[higher-order abstract syntax]] in a [[type safe]] fashion. Here is an embedding of the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] with an arbitrary collection of [[base type]]s, [[tuple (computer science)|tuple]]s and a [[fixed point combinator]]:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Lam :: * -&gt; * where
  Lift :: a                     -&gt; Lam a        -- ^ lifted value
  Pair :: Lam a -&gt; Lam b        -&gt; Lam (a, b)   -- ^ product
  Lam  :: (Lam a -&gt; Lam b)      -&gt; Lam (a -&gt; b) -- ^ lambda abstraction
  App  :: Lam (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Lam a -&gt; Lam b        -- ^ function application
  Fix  :: Lam (a -&gt; a)          -&gt; Lam a        -- ^ fixed point
&lt;/source&gt;
And a type safe evaluation function:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
eval :: Lam t -&gt; t
eval (Lift v)   = v
eval (Pair l r) = (eval l, eval r)
eval (Lam f)    = \x -&gt; eval (f (Lift x))
eval (App f x)  = (eval f) (eval x)
eval (Fix f)    = (eval f) (eval (Fix f))
&lt;/source&gt;
The factorial function can now be written as:
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
fact = Fix (Lam (\f -&gt; Lam (\y -&gt; Lift (if eval y == 0 then 1 else eval y * (eval f) (eval y - 1)))))
eval(fact)(10)
&lt;/source&gt;
We would have run into problems using regular algebraic data types. Dropping the type parameter would have made the lifted base types existentially quantified, making it impossible to write the evaluator. With a type parameter we would still be restricted to a single base type. Furthermore, ill-formed expressions such as &lt;code&gt;App (Lam (\x -&gt; Lam (\y -&gt; App x y))) (Lift True)&lt;/code&gt; would have been possible to construct, while they are type incorrect using the GADT. A well-formed analogue is &lt;code&gt;App (Lam (\x -&gt; Lam (\y -&gt; App x y))) (Lift (\z -&gt; True))&lt;/code&gt;. This is because the type of &lt;code&gt;x &lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Lam (a -&gt; b)&lt;/code&gt;, inferred from the type of the &lt;code&gt;Lam&lt;/code&gt; data constructor.

==Biography==

=== Youth and formative years ===
Jacques Martin was born on 24 June 1906 in [[Sainte-Colombe, Rhône]] where his father was teaching. His grandfather was a [[methodist]] minister. From 1923 to 1927, he studied at the [[Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajpn.org/juste-Jacques-Martin-1846.html Page on Jacques Martin on the "Anonymes, Justes et Persécutés durant la période Nazie dans les communes de France" website, last accessed on 12 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; There he became friends with [[André Trocmé]], who was a few years older than him. He also met another student, [[Henri Roser]], whose militant [[pacifist]] and [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] ideas shook French protestant society of that time. Jacques Martin then became a pacifist himself, and wished to contribute personally to international reconciliation, starting with France and Germany.&lt;ref name = PC07/&gt; 
He crisscrossed Germany walking through the 1925 summer. As a member of the French branch of the [[World Student Christian Federation]] (WSCF, which is casually referred to as the “Fédé”), he took part in the 1926 German gathering of the WSCF. The same year he took charge of the editing of  “Cahiers de la Réconciliation » (at the time a simple information bulletin which would be taken over and developed by [[Henri Roser]] from November 1927 on).&lt;ref name = past/&gt;
In 1927, he took part in an "international reconciliation youth camp" in [[Vaumarcus]], Switzerland, studied one semester in [[Berlin]] in 1929, where he got in touch with German pacifist [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze]]. In 1930, he welcomed [[Gandhi]] in Paris. From 1930 to 1932 he was the secretary of the WSCF.&lt;ref name = PC07/&gt;

=== Conscientious objector ===
In spite of his pacifist convictions, Jacques Martin performed [[military service]] in 1927-1928 - out of care for his father who had just been shaken by the loss of two sons.&lt;ref name = PC07/&gt; However, in December 1930, he returned his military papers, specifying that, as a Christian, he could not bear arms. In 1932, he refused to take part in a training session of the [[military reserve force]] and he was consequently arrested, tried and condemned to 12 months in prison on 11 October 1932.
On 23 janvier 1934, Jacques Martin married Jacqueline Élié in [[Alès]].&lt;ref name = past/&gt;
In the summer of 1934, the young couple was expecting its first child when a new call-in letter arrived for a new follow-up military training, which he again refused to attend. He is arrested in the midst of the “Fédé”’s summer camp, and condemned to another 18 months in prison in February 1935. He was released in January 1936  and again briefly imprisoned in 1937, 1938 and 1939. His only companions on this harsh road of conscience objection were at this stage a protestant theology student, Philippe Vernier&lt;ref name = PC07/&gt; and a protestant primary school teacher Camille Rombault.&lt;ref name = JPC&gt;Jean-Paul Cahn, Françoise Knopper, Anne-Marie Saint-Gille, De la Guerre juste à la paix juste: Aspects confessionnels de la construction de la paix dans l'espace franco-allemand (XVIe-XXe siècle), Collection Histoire et civilisations, Presses Universitaires Septentrion, 2008, 313 pages, {{ISBN|9782757400388}}, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; His failing health ensured his definitive exemption from military service before the start of WWII.

Jacques Martin turned each of his trials into a platform to advertise for conscience objection. His defence counsel was solicitor and socialist MP [[André Philip]], who called upon leading intellectuals like [[Jean Guéhenno]] or [[Marc Sangnier]] and upon representatives of the [[Human Rights League (France)|French Human Rights League]]. As early as 1928, Martin had temporarily given up on his career in church ministry because of the staunch opposition of institutional protestantism towards his pacifist and anti-militaristic positions. In 1938, still unable to become a pastor, he accepted a position of administrative and human resources director in a silk stockings manufacturing plant in [[Ganges, Hérault]].

=== War years ===
In the wake of the first [[Vichy anti-Jewish legislation]] by [[Philippe Pétain|Marshall Pétain]]’s government on 3 October 1940,  Jacques Martin decided jointly with Ganges’ pastor Élie Gounelle to call for a regional meeting of all protestant pastors in the area, in order to pray and reflect on the new situation, including the apparent support apparently extended to the Vichy government by the church authorities – including, at that early stage, by the president of the [[Protestant Federation of France]], pastor [[Marc Boegner]]. According to Jacques Martin’s own account, the day was “dedicated to the problem of anti-Semitism or rather to anti-Semitism and the [[Bible]]”.&lt;ref name = PC07/&gt; A second such meeting, in November 1942, would be organised to respond to the new situation created by the roundups of 26 August 1942 in the southern zone of France. In both of these meetings, Jacques Martin shared a very well-informed and accurate documentation which allowed pastors to prepare themselves for resistance to the anti-Semitic policy of the Vichy regime.&lt;ref name = PC07/&gt; 
At the same time, the Martins had joined the [[CIMADE]] in close cooperation with [[Madeleine Barot]]. They intervened in several ways: supplying packages with food or warm clothes for the [[Gurs internment camp]] internees, sheltering fleeing Jews and routing them towards safe caches or appropriate underground escape routes, forging identity cards and ration tickets for the hidden Jews. They also hid Jacques’ brother-in-law, pastor [[André Trocmé]] when he had to go underground in their family house in [[Drôme]]. On 22 June 1944, Jacques Martin was reported to the police by his direct neighbour. He was arrested by the [[Milice]] and detained in [[Montpellier]]’s prison. Strangely, the local Resistance managed to negotiate his release in exchange for a flock of 1’000 sheep. He was freed three days before the liberation of his area&lt;ref name = YVF/&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref name = past/&gt; 
During the war years he became friends with historian [[Jules Isaac]] who had sought refuge in Ganges.

=== Lay and clerical ministries ===
After the war, Jacques Martin was back in touch with the « Social Christians », a mainly protestant movement seeking to join together evangelism and care for the poorer classes of society; after meeting with Élie Gounelle at “[[Musée Social]] “ (a Parisian think tank), he prepared the relaunching of the movement and of its magazine, the “Revue du Christianisme Social”. He also organised the 25th Christian Social Congress in Paris.

In 1948, he participated in the creation of the French branch of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]], called les Amitiés judéo-chrétiennes (A.J.C.  -  Jewish Christian Friendships) whose first president was catholic theologian [[Henri-Irénée Marrou]], while Jacques Martin was both the first vice-president and the AJC bulletin’s editor.
While continuing with its commitments with the CIMADE, A.J.C., and Social Christians, Jacques Martin still didn’t apply to become a pastor although the institutional opposition had then faded away. ([[Henri Roser]] was for instance now in charge of a parish.) He preferred to experience the position of a "committed layman".

From 1947 to 1950, he ran a bookshop in [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]] where he also taught Latin at the [[Collège Cévenol]], then from 1950 to 1966 he ran another bookshop in [[Lyon]].

On 29 March 1966, he welcomed [[Martin Luther King]] on his visit in Lyon.
Finally he felt the need to "bind the sheaf" and was ordained on 9 January 1966 by the [[French Reformed Church]] (after a last hesitation from the institution, as the candidate is already 60!) and took a position with the Geneva state church. He is put in charge of the creation of a new parish in a newly built area of the greater Geneva. This parish is now known as the Centre Communautaire Protestant du Lignon.&lt;ref name = past/&gt;
Having retired in 1973, he still performed pastoral tasks in Mens&lt;!--[[Mens, Isère]]?--&gt; from 1973 to 1977, and finally took full retirement in the area of [[Die, Drôme|Die]], still acting as a substitute pastor in case of vacancies).&lt;ref name = past/&gt;

He died in [[Die, Drôme|Die]] on 23 July 2001. His wife had died 5 years earlier on 30 September 1996. They had had six children: André (1934-1934), Violaine (born 1937), Daniel (born 1937), Amy-Christiane (1939-1945), Jean-Marc (born 1941) et Ariane (born 1950).&lt;ref name = past/&gt;

==Distinctions==
After WWII, he was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945 (France)|Croix de guerre]] in tribute to his fight "to help [[Service du travail obligatoire|Compulsory Work Service dodgers]], les réfractaires, les [[Maquis (World War II)|maquisards]] and all victims of enemy repression."!&lt;ref name = YVF/&gt;
On 22 June 1998, [[Yad Vashem]] awarded the recognition of « [[Righteous Among the Nations]]» both to pastor Jacques Martin and to his wife Jacqueline.&lt;ref name = YVF/&gt;

== Contribution and legacy ==

=== Clear-sightedness over Nazism and anti-Semitism ===
Probably unique among pacifists, Jacques Martin was "one of the very few" who rejected the "hopes of a nebulous French-German reconciliation" stemming from the [[Munich agreement]] and who therefore were immediately "in Resistance", according to Jacques Martin’s own words in 1938: "I remain more than ever non-violent. But I do not harbour any confusion between non-violence and non-resistance. Non-violence means placing resistance on another level than the test of military forces. This resistance is necessary… ».&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Jacques Martin to his father-in-law, 26 October 1938, Violaine Kichenin-Martin Archives, quoted by Patrick Cabanel, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;"
In a context where justifications of [[anti-Semitism]] abound, sometimes even from protestants, Jacques Martin published in August 1939 an article entitled « Pagan … and Christian anti-Semitism” (L’Antisémitisme païen… et chrétien). In its first part, the article gives a detailed list, country by country, of anti-Semitic persecutions in Europe, while the second part deals with the Christians’ attitude and sometimes responsibility. Referring to the traditional Christian accusation of [[Jewish deicide]], he asks : « Who does not reject Christ ? Does Christianity not bear the same responsibility than the Jews for the crucifixion of its Master ? Is our own so-called Christian civilisation not bearing more witness of a deeper and more serious rejection and blasphemy than the shouts of a versatile crowd or the calculations of a [[sanhedrin]] lost in its clericalism and its pride? ».&lt;ref&gt;Article by Jacques Martin in Revue du Christianisme Social, August 1939, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparation for anti-Nazi resistance===
With their two pastoral meeting held in [[Ganges]], Jacques Martin and Elie Gounelle prepared their colleagues to exert solidarity towards the persecuted Jews. « We had gathered all the pastors of this area of the Cevennes to study this question. These were necessary preliminaries. Caring for the Jews didn’t happen spontaneously, not even from the [[camisards]]’ memory ! A long preparation phase, a reflection were needed first, often in opposition with certain protestant theological concepts, where Judaism was regarded as a mere preamble to Christianity, whereas  there was a real spiritual problem, alongside a humanitarian situation from 1942 onwards ».&lt;ref&gt;Autobiographical text by Jacques Martin,  read during the Valleraugue seminar in 1984, quoted by Philippe Joutard, Jacques Poujol &amp; Patrick Cabanel (dir.), Cévennes, terre de refuge, 4e éd., 2006 [1987], pp. 239-240.&lt;/ref&gt; For these meetings, Jacques Martin had gathered very significant documentation, first on the events on the ground which he had ample information about through the Cimade network and through other pastors operating on the ground like [[Henri Manen]], then on the Vichy anti-Semitic laws through articles found in the Swiss protestant Press and in internal French protestant churches texts, like the [[:fr:Thèses de Pomeyrol Pomeyrol theses]].&lt;ref name = PC07/&gt;

=== Forerunner of conscientious objection in France ===
With a few of his fellow protestant theology students, Jacques Martin was a pionnier of [[pacifism]] in France ; in 1923, he was the first editor of the review of ''Mouvement international de la réconciliation'' (MIR), the French branch of the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]].&lt;ref name = MB88&gt;Majagira Bulangalire, Le mouvement international de la réconciliation et le problème du pacifisme dans le protestantisme français de l'entre-deux-guerres (avec un aperçu jusqu'à 1960) . In: École pratique des hautes études, Section des sciences religieuses. Annuaire. Tome 97, 1988-1989. 1988. pp. 491-493. [http://www.persee.fr/doc/ephe_0000-0002_1988_num_101_97_18313]&lt;/ref&gt; 
At his two trials, Jacques Martin was defended by sollicitor [[André Philip]], who also defended Camille Rombault and Philippe Vernier. All these trials for draft dodging made big headlines in 1932 and 1933. André Philip used them as platforms for conscientious objectors, developing his arguments further at each trial. He called upon pastors such as [[Marc Boegner]], [[Henri Nick]], [[André Trocmé]] and [[Charles Westphal]] and leading intellectuals such as [[Marc Sangnier]], [[Jean Guehenno]] and [[Julien Benda]].&lt;ref name = JPC/&gt; These trials were a wake-up call for French society and foremost for the French protestants who not only became more visible on the national scene at this occasion but whose internal opinion was also shifted at the same time.&lt;ref name = MB88/&gt; In 1948, the French Reformed Church officially adopted the position that conscientious objection was legitimate and requested the State to grant a legal status to conscientious objectors; the [[Catholic Church in France|French Catholic Church]] will wait until 1965 to take the same position.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Durand, ''La Désobéissance civile et nous; à l'école de Gandhi et Luther King''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9248">The '''Lanczos tensor''' or '''Lanczos potential''' is a [[tensor rank|rank 3 tensor]] in [[general relativity]] that generates the [[Weyl tensor]].&lt;ref name="Takeno"&gt;Hyôitirô Takeno, "On the spintensor of Lanczos", ''Tensor'', '''15''' (1964) pp. 103–119.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first introduced by [[Cornelius Lanczos]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="Lanczos1949"&gt;Cornelius Lanczos, "Lagrangian Multiplier and Riemannian Spaces", ''Rev. Mod. Phys.'', '''21''' (1949) pp. 497–502. {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.21.497}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theoretical importance of the Lanczos tensor is that it serves as the [[gauge field]] for the [[gravitational field]] in the same way that, by analogy, the [[electromagnetic four-potential]] generates the [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref name="O'DonnellPye"&gt;P. O’Donnell and H. Pye, "A Brief Historical Review of the Important Developments in Lanczos Potential Theory", ''EJTP'', '''7''' (2010) pp. 327–350. {{url|http://www.ejtp.com/articles/ejtpv7i24p327.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NovelloVelloso"&gt;M.

==Definition==
The Lanczos tensor can be defined in a few different ways.  The most common modern definition is through the Weyl–Lanczos equations, which demonstrate the generation of the Weyl tensor from the Lanczos tensor.&lt;ref name="NovelloVelloso" /&gt;  These equations, presented below, were given by Takeno in 1964.&lt;ref name="Takeno" /&gt;  The way that Lanczos introduced the tensor originally was as a [[Lagrange multiplier]]&lt;ref name="Lanczos1949" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Lanczos, "The Splitting of the Riemann Tensor", ''Rev. Mod. Phys.'', '''34''' (1962) pp. 379–389. {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.34.379}}&lt;/ref&gt; on constraint terms studied in the [[variational methods in general relativity|variational approach to general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Lanczos, "A Remarkable Property of the Riemann–Christoffel Tensor in Four Dimensions", ''Annals of Mathematics'', '''39''' (1938) pp. 842–850. {{url|https://www.jstor.org/stable/1968467}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under any definition, the Lanczos tensor ''H'' exhibits the following symmetries:
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{abc}+H_{bac}=0,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{abc}+H_{bca}+H_{cab}=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

The Lanczos tensor always exists in four dimensions&lt;ref name="BC1983"&gt;F. Bampi and G.

Massa and E. Pagani, "Is the Riemann tensor derivable from a tensor potential?", ''General Relativity and Gravitation'', '''16''' (1984) pp. 805–816. {{doi|10.1007/BF00762934}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Einstein field equations]] must provide the [[Ricci tensor]] to complete the components of the [[Ricci decomposition]].

===Weyl–Lanczos equations===

The Weyl–Lanczos equations express the Weyl tensor entirely as derivatives of the Lanczos tensor:&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"&gt;P. O’Donnell, "A Solution of the Weyl–Lanczos Equations for the Schwarzschild Space–Time", ''General Relativity and Gravitation'', '''36''' (2004) pp. 1415–1422. {{doi|10.1023/B:GERG.0000022577.11259.e0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
C_{abcd}=
H_{abc;d}+H_{cda;b}+H_{bad;c}+H_{dcb;a} 
+ (H^e{}_{(ac);e} + H_{(a|e|}{}^e{}_{;c)})g_{bd} 
+ (H^e{}_{(bd);e} + H_{(b|e|}{}^e{}_{;d)})g_{ac}
- (H^e{}_{(ad);e} + H_{(a|e|}{}^e{}_{;d)})g_{bc} 
- (H^e{}_{(bc);e} + H_{(b|e|}{}^e{}_{;c)})g_{ad}
-\frac{2}{3} H^{ef}{}_{f;e}(g_{ac}g_{bd}-g_{ad}g_{bc})
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is the Weyl tensor, the semicolon denotes the [[covariant derivative]], and the subscripted parentheses indicate [[symmetric tensor|symmetrization]].  Although the above equations can be used to define the Lanczos tensor, they also show that it is not unique but rather has [[gauge freedom]] under an [[affine group]].&lt;ref&gt;K. S. Hammon and L. K. Norris "The Affine Geometry of the Lanczos ''H''-tensor Formalism", ''General Relativity and Gravitation'','''25''' (1993) pp. 55–80. {{doi|10.1007/BF00756929}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If &lt;math&gt;\Phi^a&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary [[vector field]], then the Weyl–Lanczos equations are invariant under the gauge transformation

:&lt;math&gt;H'_{abc} = H_{abc}+\Phi_{[a} g_{b]c}&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscripted brackets indicate [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetrization]].  An often convenient choice is the Lanczos algebraic gauge, &lt;math&gt;\Phi_a=-\frac{2}{3}H_{ab}{}^b,&lt;/math&gt; which sets &lt;math&gt;H'_{ab}{}^b=0.&lt;/math&gt;  The gauge can be further restricted through the Lanczos differential gauge &lt;math&gt;H_{ab}{}^c{}_{;c}=0&lt;/math&gt;.  These gauge choices reduce the Weyl–Lanczos equations to the simpler form

:&lt;math&gt;
C_{abcd}=H_{abc;d}+H_{cda;b}+H_{bad;c}+H_{dcb;a}
+H^e{}_{ac;e}g_{bd}+H^e{}_{bd;e}g_{ac}-H^e{}_{ad;e}g_{bc}-H^e{}_{bc;e}g_{ad}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Wave equation==
The Lanczos potential tensor satisfies a wave equation&lt;ref&gt;P. Dolan and C. W. Kim  "The wave equation for the Lanczos potential", ''Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A'', '''447''' (1994) pp. 557-575. {{doi|10.1098/rspa.1994.0155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\Box H_{abc} = &amp; J_{abc}\\
&amp; {}- 2{R_c}^d H_{abd}+{R_a}^d H_{bcd}+{R_b}^d H_{acd}\\
&amp; {}+ \left( H_{dbe}g_{ac}-H_{dae}g_{bc} \right)R^{de}+\frac{1}{2}RH_{abc},\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; is the [[d'Alembert operator]] and
:&lt;math&gt;J_{abc} = R_{ca;b}-R_{cb;a}-\frac{1}{6}\left( g_{ca}R_{;b}-g_{cb}R_{;a} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
is known as the [[Cotton tensor]].  Since the Cotton tensor depends only on [[covariant derivative]]s of the [[Ricci tensor]], it can perhaps be interpreted as a kind of matter current.&lt;ref name="Roberts1996"&gt;Mark D. Roberts, "The Physical Interpretation of the Lanczos Tensor." ''Nuovo Cim.B'' '''110''' (1996) 1165-1176. {{doi|10.1007/BF02724607}} {{arXiv|gr-qc/9904006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The additional self-coupling terms have no direct electromagnetic equivalent.  These self-coupling terms, however, do not affect the [[vacuum solution (general relativity)|vacuum solutions]], where the Ricci tensor vanishes and the curvature is described entirely by the Weyl tensor.  Thus in vacuum, the [[Einstein field equations]] are equivalent to the [[homogeneous differential equation|homogeneous]] wave equation &lt;math&gt;\Box H_{abc} = 0,&lt;/math&gt; in perfect analogy to the vacuum wave equation &lt;math&gt;\Box A_{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt; of the electromagnetic four-potential.  This shows a formal similarity between [[gravitational wave]]s and [[electromagnetic wave]]s, with the Lanczos tensor well-suited for studying gravitational waves.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. López-Bonilla, G. Ovando and J. J. Peña, "A Lanczos Potential for Plane Gravitational Waves." ''Foundations of Physics Letters'' '''12''' (1999) 401-405. {{doi|10.1023/A:1021656622094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the weak field approximation where &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}=\eta_{ab}+h_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, a convenient form for the Lanczos tensor in the Lanczos gauge is&lt;ref name="Roberts1996" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;4H_{abc} \approx h_{ac,b}-h_{bc,a}-\frac{1}{6}(\eta_{ac}{h^d}_{d,b}-\eta_{bc}{h^d}_{d,a}) .&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
The most basic nontrivial case for expressing the Lanczos tensor is, of course, for the [[Schwarzschild metric]].&lt;ref name="NovelloVelloso" /&gt;  The simplest, explicit component representation in [[natural units]] for the Lanczos tensor in this case is
:&lt;math&gt;H_{trt}=\frac{GM}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
with all other components vanishing up to symmetries.  This form, however, is not in the Lanczos gauge.  The nonvanishing terms of the Lanczos tensor in the Lanczos gauge are
:&lt;math&gt;H_{trt}=\frac{2GM}{3r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{r\theta\theta}=\frac{-GM}{3(1-2GM/r)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{r\phi\phi}=\frac{-GM\sin^2 \theta}{3(1-2GM/r)}&lt;/math&gt;

It is further possible to show, even in this simple case, that the Lanczos tensor cannot in general be reduced to a linear combination of the spin coefficients of the [[Newman–Penrose formalism]], which attests to the Lanczos tensor's fundamental nature.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell" /&gt;  Similar calculations have been used to construct arbitrary [[Petrov type D]] solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Zafar Ahsan and Mohd Bilal, "A Solution of Weyl-Lanczos Equations for Arbitrary Petrov Type D Vacuum Spacetimes." ''Int J Theor Phys'' '''49''' (2010) 2713-2722. {{doi|10.1007/s10773-010-0464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''league system''' is a [[hierarchy]] of [[sports league|leagues]] in a sport. They are often called '''pyramids''', due to their tendency to split into an increasing number of regional divisions further down the system. League systems of some sort are used in many sports in many countries.

In [[association football]], [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]], league systems are usually connected by the process of [[promotion and relegation]], in which teams from a lower division who finish at the top of the standings in their league are promoted (advanced to the next level of the system) while teams who finish lowest in their division are relegated (move down to a lower division). This process can be automatic each year, or can require playoffs.

In North America, league systems in the most popular sports do not use promotion or relegation. Most [[professional sports]] are divided into [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major]] and [[minor league]]s. [[Baseball]] and association football (known as soccer in North America) have well-defined pyramid shapes to their minor league hierarchies, each managed by a governing body ([[Minor League Baseball]], an organization under the authority of the [[Commissioner of Baseball]], governs baseball leagues; the [[United States Soccer Federation]] designates the American soccer pyramid.) [[Ice hockey]]'s professional minor league system is linear, with one league at most of the four levels of the game; the ice hockey league system in North America is governed by [[collective bargaining agreement]]s and affiliation deals between the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], [[American Hockey League|AHL]] and [[ECHL]].

[[Gridiron football]] does not operate on a league system. Different professional leagues play by [[List of gridiron football rules|very different sets of rules]] in different seasons (the [[National Football League|NFL]] plays 11-a-side on a 100-yard field in autumn and early winter, the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] uses 12-a-side on a 110-yard field in summer and early fall, while [[arena football]] and the [[indoor American football|minor indoor leagues]] each play 8-a-side on a 50-yard field in the spring and early summer). There have been attempts at forming true minor leagues for the professional game (most recently with 2017's [[The Spring League]]); none so far have been able to balance the major leagues' requests with the ability to maintain financial solvency.

[[File:Cmglee London Dalston House side.jpg|thumb|''Dalston House'' from another angle]]
'''Leandro Erlich''' (born 1973 in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]) is an internationally exhibited Argentine conceptual artist. In 2001 he represented his nation at the [[Venice Biennial]] and was included in the main section of the biennial once again in 2005.&lt;ref name="skny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skny.com/artists/leandro-erlich/|title=Sean Kelly Gallery - Leandro Erlich - Artist Biography|publisher=skny.com|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist's work was also included in the 2000 [[Whitney Biennial]] and the 2001 [[Istanbul Biennial]].&lt;ref name="artnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/leandro-erlich/|title=Leandro Erlich on artnet|publisher=artnet.com|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008 Erlich created a swimming pool installation which was on display at [[MoMA PS1]] in the [[Long Island City]] section of [[Queens]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="momaps1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/207|title=MoMA PS1: Exhibitions: Leandro Erlich: Swimming Pool|publisher=momaps1.org|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2013, Erlich exhibited ''Dalston House'', an [[optical illusion]] at the Dalston Mill site in [[Dalston]], East London with a huge mirror suspended at 45° (from the horizontal) over a life-size model of the façade of a Victorian terraced townhouse placed horizontally on the ground, giving the appearance of visitors climbing or hanging off the side of the building.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/10141549/Artist-Leandro-Erlich-offers-crazy-perspective-at-his-illusion-house-in-east-London.html "Artist Leandro Erlich offers 'crazy perspective' at his illusion house in east London"], The Telegraph, 25 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Erlich's most popular works is his immersive architectural environment called ''Swimming Pool'', which has been exhibited at [[MoMA PS1]] in [[Queens, New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and is now on permanent display as part of the collection at the [[21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa|21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art]] in [[Kanazawa]], [[Japan]] .&lt;ref&gt;http://momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kanazawa21.jp/data_list.php?g=30&amp;d=7&amp;lng=e&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28407">This [[list of rampage killers]] contains those cases where only vehicles were [[Vehicle-ramming attack|used to attack people]]. Since it may be quite difficult to distinguish accidents, or cases of reckless driving from those incidents where the driver, or pilot, had the intention to harm others, only those cases are included where it is clear that the vehicle was applied as a weapon and crashed deliberately into people, other vehicles, or buildings. Also, those cases where a rampage killer used an armed vehicle, such as a tank, or a fighter aircraft, to shoot others are listed here. [[Airliner]]s are not included in this section but in [[List of rampage killers#Other incidents|other incidents]].

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

'''''Looming''''' is a term found in the study of [[perception]], as it relates directly to [[psychology]].  Looming refers to the rapid expansion in the size of any given image. As the image becomes increasingly large on the perceiver's [[retina]], i.e., when an object ''looms'', there is an automatic [[physiological]] response to [[Perception|perceive]] the object as an approaching [[object or surface]], instead of one that is [[:wikt:stationary|stationary]] or receding.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, J. J. (2014). ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception: Classic Edition''. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence indicates that looming perception is not limited to the visual modality, but can occur due to auditory or even tactile stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, R. (2011). Looming auditory collision warnings for driving. ''Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society'', 53(1), 63-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, B. D. (2014). Tactile Displays for Cueing Self-Motion and Looming: What Would Gibson Think?. ''Advances in Cognitive Engineering and Neuroergonomics'', 11, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is a different type of [[mirage]] that is also described as looming, in which distant objects appear much nearer than they actually are, is explained in the same way as the image of the ship, except that the image is not inverted; the density variations may also act as a [[magnifying glass]].

'''Master–slave morality''' is a central theme of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s works, in particular the first essay of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''. Nietzsche argued that there were two fundamental types of [[morality]]: "master morality" and "slave morality". Master morality values pride and power, while slave morality values things like kindness, empathy, and sympathy. Master morality weighs actions on good or bad consequences (i. e., classical virtues and vices, [[consequentialism]]), unlike slave morality, which weighs actions on a scale of [[Good and evil|good or evil]] intentions (e. g., Christian virtues and vices, [[Kantian ethics|Kantian deontology]]).

For Nietzsche, a particular morality is inseparable from the formation of a particular culture, meaning that a culture's language, codes and practices, narratives, and institutions are informed by the struggle between these two moral structures (see [[Value theory|valuation]]).

==Master morality==
Nietzsche defined master morality as the morality of the strong-willed. Nietzsche criticizes the view (which he identifies with contemporary British ideology) that good is everything that is helpful, and bad is everything that is harmful. He argues proponents of this view have forgotten the origins of its values and it is based merely on a non-critical acceptance of habit: what is useful has always been defined as good, therefore usefulness is goodness as a value. He continues explaining that in the prehistoric state "the value or non-value of an action was derived from its consequences"{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=62}} but ultimately "[t]here are no moral phenomena at all, only moral interpretations of phenomena."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=96}} For strong-willed men, the "good" is the noble, strong, and powerful, while the "bad" is the weak, cowardly, timid, and petty. 

The essence of master morality is ''nobility''. Other qualities that are often valued in master morality are open-mindedness, courage, truthfulness, trust, and an accurate sense of one's self-worth. Master morality begins in the "noble man", with a spontaneous idea of the good; then the idea of bad develops as what is not good. "The noble type of man experiences ''itself'' as determining values; it does not need approval; it judges, "what is harmful to me is harmful in itself"; it knows itself to be that which first accords honour to things; it is ''value-creating''."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=39}} In this sense, the master morality is the full recognition that ''oneself'' is the measure of all moral truths.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Insofar as something is helpful to the strong-willed man, it is like what he values in himself; therefore, the strong-willed man values such things as good because they aid him in a life-long process of [[self-actualization]] through the [[will to power]].

==Slave morality==

According to Nietzsche, masters are creators of morality; slaves respond to master morality with their slave morality. Unlike master morality, which is sentiment, slave morality is based on [[ressentiment|re-sentiment]]—devaluing that which the master values and the slave does not have. As master morality originates in the strong, slave morality originates in the weak. Because slave morality is a reaction to oppression, it vilifies its oppressors. Slave morality is the inverse of master morality. As such, it is characterized by pessimism and cynicism. Slave morality is created in opposition to what master morality values as "good". 

Slave morality does not aim at exerting one's will by strength, but by careful subversion. It does not seek to transcend the masters, but to make them slaves as well. The essence of slave morality is ''utility'':{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=122}} The good is what is most useful for the whole community, not just the strong. Nietzsche saw this as a contradiction. Since the powerful are few in number, compared to the masses of the weak, the weak gain power by corrupting the strong into believing that the causes of slavery (viz., the [[will to power]]) are "evil", as are the qualities the weak originally could not choose because of their weakness. By saying humility is voluntary, slave morality avoids admitting that their humility was in the beginning forced upon them by a master. [[Biblical]] principles of humility, charity, and pity are the result of universalizing the plight of the slave onto all humankind, and thus enslaving the masters as well. "The ''democratic'' movement is the heir to [[Christianity]]"{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=125}}—the political manifestation of slave morality because of its obsession with freedom and equality.

{{quote|...the Jews achieved that miracle of inversion of values thanks to which life on earth has for a couple millennia acquired a new and dangerous fascination - their prophets fused "rich", "godless", "evil", "violent", "sensual" into one, and were the first to coin the word "world" as a term of infamy. It is this inversion of values (with which is involved the employment of the word for "poor" as a synonym for "holy" and "friend") that the significance of the Jewish people resides: With ''them'', there begins the ''slave revolt in morals''.{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=118}}}}

==Society==

This struggle between master and slave moralities recurs historically. According to Nietzsche, ancient Greek and Roman societies were grounded in master morality. The [[Homer]]ic hero is the strong-willed man, and the classical roots of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' exemplified Nietzsche's master morality. He calls the heroes "men of a noble culture",{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=153}} giving a substantive example of master morality. Historically, master morality was defeated, as the slave morality of Judaism and Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire. 

The essential struggle between cultures has always been between the Roman (master, strong) and the Judean (slave, weak). Nietzsche condemns the triumph of slave morality in the West, saying that the democratic movement is the "''collective degeneration of man''".{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=127}} He claimed that the nascent democratic movement of his time was essentially slavish and weak.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Weakness conquered strength, slave conquered master, re-sentiment conquered sentiment. This [[ressentiment]] Nietzsche calls "priestly vindictiveness",{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=19}} which is based on the jealous weak seeking to enslave the strong, and thus erode the basis for power itself by pulling the powerful down. Such movements were, according to Nietzsche, inspired by "the most intelligent revenge" of the weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Genealogy of Morals: A Polemic. By Way of Clarification and Supplement to My Last Book Beyond Good and Evil|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-953708-2|location=|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche saw democracy and Christianity as the same emasculating impulse which sought to make everyone equal by making everyone a slave.{{Cn|date=January 2017}}

Nietzsche did not necessarily believe that everyone should adopt master morality as the "be-all, end-all" behavior. He thought that the [[Transvaluation of values|revaluation of morals]] would correct the inconsistencies in both master and slave moralities. But he asserted that for the individual, master morality was preferable to slave morality. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] disagrees that Nietzsche actually preferred master morality to slave morality. He certainly gives slave morality a more thorough critique, but this is partly because he thought of slave morality as society's more imminent danger.{{citation needed|reason=Sentence is vaguely worded and lacks documentation.|date=October 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2617">In [[mathematics]],  the '''matching distance'''&lt;ref name="dAFrLa06"&gt;Michele d'Amico, Patrizio Frosini, Claudia Landi, ''Using matching distance in Size Theory: a survey'', International Journal of Imaging Systems and Technology, 16(5):154–161, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dAFrLa10"&gt;Michele d'Amico, Patrizio Frosini, Claudia Landi, ''Natural pseudo-distance and optimal matching between reduced size functions'', Acta Applicandae Mathematicae, 109(2):527-554, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on the space of [[size function]]s.

[[Image:DistMatchWiki1.png|thumb|500px|Example: The matching distance between &lt;math&gt;\ell_1=r+a+b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell_2=r'+a'&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;d_\text{match}(\ell_1, \ell_2)=\max\{\delta(r,r'),\delta(b,a'),\delta(a,\Delta)\}=4&lt;/math&gt;]]

The core of the definition of matching distance is the observation that the
information contained in a size function can be combinatorially stored in a formal series of lines and points of the plane, called respectively ''[[size function|cornerlines]]''  and ''[[size function|cornerpoints]]''.

Given two size functions &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell_2&lt;/math&gt;,  let  &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;) be the multiset of
all cornerpoints and cornerlines for &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\ell_2&lt;/math&gt;) counted with their
multiplicities, augmented by adding a countable infinity of points  of the
diagonal &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y)\in \R^2: x=y\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''matching distance'' between &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell_2&lt;/math&gt; is given by
&lt;math&gt;d_\text{match}(\ell_1, \ell_2)=\min_\sigma\max_{p\in C_1}\delta (p,\sigma(p))&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; varies among all the bijections between &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;\delta\left((x,y),(x',y')\right)=\min\left\{\max \{|x-x'|,|y-y'|\}, \max\left\{\frac{y-x}{2},\frac{y'-x'}{2}\right\}\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Roughly speaking, the matching distance &lt;math&gt;d_\text{match}&lt;/math&gt;
between two size functions is the minimum, over all the matchings
between the cornerpoints of the two size functions, of the maximum
of the &lt;math&gt;L_\infty&lt;/math&gt;-distances between two matched cornerpoints. Since
two size functions can have a different number of cornerpoints,
these can be also matched to points of the diagonal &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, the definition of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; implies that matching two points of the diagonal has no cost.

'''Memetics''' (also referred to colloquially as '''memeology''') is the study of information and culture based on an analogy with [[Darwinian evolution]]. Proponents describe memetics as an approach to [[evolutionary model]]s of cultural [[information transfer]]. Critics regard memetics as a [[pseudoscience]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} Memetics describes how an idea can propagate successfully, but doesn't necessarily imply a concept is factual.&lt;ref name="Science, Imitation and Memetics"&gt;Kantorovich, Aharon (2013) [http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9912/ An Evolutionary View of Science: Imitation and Memetics.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[meme]] was coined in [[Richard Dawkins]]' 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]],'' but Dawkins later distanced himself from the resulting field of study.&lt;ref name="misunderstanding"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burman | first1 = J.

Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief is seen as an idea-replicator reproducing itself in a new host. As with genetics, particularly under a [[Gene-centered view of evolution|Dawkinsian]] interpretation, a meme's success may be due to its contribution to the effectiveness of its host.

==History==
In his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976), the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] used the term ''[[meme]]'' to describe a unit of human [[Cultural learning|cultural transmission]] analogous to the [[gene]], arguing that replication also happens in [[culture]], albeit in a different sense. Bella Hiscock outlined a similar hypothesis in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cloak | first1 = F.T. | year = 1975 | title = Is a cultural ethology possible? | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/x724552557812338 | journal = Human Ecology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 161–182 | doi=10.1007/bf01531639}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Dawkins referenced. [[Cultural evolution]] itself is a much older topic, with a history that dates back at least as far as [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s era.

Dawkins (1976) proposed that the meme is a unit of information residing in the brain and is the mutating [[self-replication|replicator]] in human [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural evolution]]. It is a pattern that can influence its surroundings – that is, it has causal agency – and can propagate. This proposal resulted in debate among sociologists, biologists, and scientists of other disciplines. Dawkins himself did not provide a sufficient explanation of how the replication of units of information in the brain controls human behaviour and ultimately culture, and the principal topic of the book was genetics. Dawkins apparently did not intend to present a comprehensive theory of ''memetics'' in ''The Selfish Gene'', but rather coined the term ''meme'' in a speculative spirit. Accordingly, different researchers came to define the term "unit of information" in different ways.

The modern memetics movement dates from the mid-1980s. A January 1983 "[[Metamagical Themas]]" column&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=o8jzWF7rD6oC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=On+viral+sentences+and+self-replicating+structures|title= Metamagical themas: questing for the ... - Google Books|publisher= Books.google.com|date= 1996-04-04| accessdate= 2010-02-18|isbn = 978-0-465-04566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in ''Scientific American'', was influential – as was his 1985 book of the same name. "Memeticist" was coined as analogous to "geneticist" – originally in ''The Selfish Gene.'' Later Arel Lucas suggested that the discipline that studies memes and their connections to human and other carriers of them be known as "memetics" by analogy with "genetics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=o8jzWF7rD6oC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=%22arel+lucas%22+memetics+themas|title= Metamagical themas: questing for the ... - Google Books|publisher = Books.google.com|date=1996-04-04|accessdate= 2010-02-18|isbn= 978-0-465-04566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins' ''The Selfish Gene'' has been a factor in attracting the attention of people of disparate intellectual backgrounds. Another stimulus was the publication in 1991 of ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' by Tufts University philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], which incorporated the meme concept into a [[theory of mind|theory of the mind]]. In his 1991 essay "[[Viruses of the Mind]]", Richard Dawkins used memetics to explain the phenomenon of religious belief and the various characteristics of organised religions. By then, memetics had also become a theme appearing in fiction (e.g. Neal Stephenson's ''[[Snow Crash]]'').

The idea of ''language as a virus'' had already been introduced by [[William S. Burroughs]] as early as 1962 in his book ''[[The Ticket That Exploded]]'', and later in ''[[The Electronic Revolution]]'', published in 1970 in ''[[The Job: Interviews with William S. Burroughs|The Job]]''. [[Douglas Rushkoff]] explored the same concept in [http://www.rushkoff.com/media-virus/ ''Media Virus: Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture''] in 1995.

However, the foundation of memetics in its full modern incarnation originated in the publication in 1996 of two books by authors outside the academic mainstream: ''Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme'' by former [[Microsoft]] executive turned motivational speaker and professional poker-player, [[Richard Brodie (programmer)|Richard Brodie]], and ''Thought Contagion: How Belief Spreads Through Society'' by [[Aaron Lynch (writer)|Aaron Lynch]], a mathematician and philosopher who worked for many years as an engineer at [[Fermilab]]. Lynch claimed to have conceived his theory totally independently of any contact with academics in the cultural evolutionary sphere, and apparently was not even aware of Dawkins' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' until his book was very close to publication.

Around the same time as the publication of the books by Lynch and Brodie the e-journal [http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/ Journal of Memetics – ''Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission''] appeared on the web. It was first hosted by the Centre for Policy Modelling at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] but later taken over by [[Francis Heylighen]] of the [[CLEA]] research institute at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]. The e-journal soon became the central point for publication and debate within the nascent memeticist community. (There had been a short-lived paper-based memetics publication starting in 1990, the ''Journal of Ideas'' edited by Elan Moritz.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1991"&gt;[http://archsix.com/omega23.com/Journal_of_Ideas/ The Journal of Ideas, {{ISSN|1049-6335}}, Contents Online]&lt;/ref&gt;) In 1999, [[Susan Blackmore]], a psychologist at the [[University of the West of England]], published ''[[The Meme Machine]]'', which more fully worked out the ideas of Dennett, Lynch, and Brodie and attempted to compare and contrast them with various approaches from the cultural evolutionary mainstream, as well as providing novel, and controversial, memetics-based theories for the evolution of language and the human sense of individual selfhood.

=== The term "meme" ===
The term "meme" derives from the [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] μιμητής (''mimētḗs''), meaning "imitator, pretender". The similar term "mneme" was used in 1904, by the German evolutionary biologist [[Richard Semon]], best known for his development of the [[engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] theory of [[memory]], in his work ''Die mnemischen Empfindungen in ihren Beziehungen zu den Originalempfindungen'', translated into English in 1921 as ''The Mneme'' {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Until [[Daniel Schacter]] published ''Forgotten Ideas, Neglected Pioneers: Richard Semon and the Story of Memory'' in 2000, Semon's work had little influence, though it was quoted extensively in [[Erwin Schrödinger]]’s prescient 1956 [[Tarner Lecture]] “[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|Mind and Matter]]”. Richard Dawkins (1976) apparently coined the word "meme" independently of Semon, writing this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"'Mimeme' comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like 'gene'. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme. If it is any consolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being related to 'memory', or to the French word même." {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Maturity===
In 2005, the ''Journal of Memetics – Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission'' ceased publication and published a set of articles on the future of memetics. The website states that although "there was to be a relaunch...after several years nothing has happened".&lt;ref name="JoMFrontpage"&gt;{{cite web|title= Journal of Memetics - Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission|url= http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/|work= Journal of Memetics|accessdate= 17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Blackmore]] has left the University of the West of England to become a freelance science-writer and now concentrates more on the field of consciousness and cognitive science. Derek Gatherer moved to work as a computer programmer in the pharmaceutical industry, although he still occasionally publishes on memetics-related matters. [[Richard Brodie (programmer)|Richard Brodie]] is now climbing the world professional poker rankings. [[Aaron Lynch (writer)|Aaron Lynch]] disowned the memetics community and the words "meme" and "memetics" (without disowning the ideas in his book), adopting the self-description "thought contagionist". He died in 2005.

[[Susan Blackmore]] (2002) re-stated the definition of meme as: whatever is copied from one person to another person, whether habits, skills, songs, stories, or any other kind of information. Further she said that memes, like genes, are replicators in the sense as defined by Dawkins.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins, R.]] (1982) [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/dawkins_replicators.html "Replicators and Vehicles"] King's College Sociobiology Group, eds., ''Current Problems in Sociobiology'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;45–64. "A replicator may be defined as any entity in the universe of which copies are made."
&lt;/ref&gt;
That is, they are information that is copied. Memes are copied by [[imitation]], teaching and other methods. The copies are not perfect: memes are copied with variation; moreover, they compete for space in our memories and for the chance to be copied again. Only some of the variants can survive. The combination of these three elements (copies; variation; competition for survival) forms precisely the condition for [[Darwinian evolution]], and so memes (and hence human cultures) evolve. Large groups of memes that are copied and passed on together are called [[co-adapted]] meme complexes, or ''[[memeplexes]]''. In Blackmore's definition, the way that a meme replicates is through imitation. This requires [[Human brain|brain]] capacity to generally imitate a model or selectively imitate the model. Since the process of social learning varies from one person to another, the imitation process cannot be said to be completely imitated. The sameness of an idea may be expressed with different memes supporting it. This is to say that the [[mutation]] rate in memetic evolution is extremely high, and mutations are even possible within each and every iteration of the imitation process. It becomes very interesting when we see that a social system composed of a complex network of microinteractions exists, but at the macro level an order emerges to create culture.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Internalists and externalists==
The memetics movement split almost immediately into two. The first group were those who wanted to stick to Dawkins' definition of a meme as "a unit of [[cultural transmission]]". Gibron Burchett, another memeticist responsible for helping to research and co-coin the term [[memetic engineering]], along with Leveious Rolando and Larry Lottman, has stated that a meme can be defined, more precisely, as "a unit of [[cultural]] [[information]] that can be copied, located in the brain". This thinking is more in line with Dawkins' second definition of the meme in his book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]''. The second group wants to redefine memes as observable [[cultural artifact]]s and behaviors. However, in contrast to those two positions, Blackmore does not reject either concept of external or internal memes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackmore|first=Susan|authorlink=Susan Blackmore |date=2003|title=Consciousness in meme machines|journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies|publisher=Imprint Academic|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two schools became known as the "internalists" and the "externalists." Prominent internalists included both Lynch and Brodie; the most vocal externalists included Derek Gatherer, a geneticist from [[Liverpool John Moores University]], and William Benzon, a writer on cultural evolution and music. The main rationale for externalism was that internal brain entities are not observable, and memetics cannot advance as a science, especially a [[quantitative research|quantitative]] science, unless it moves its emphasis onto the directly quantifiable aspects of culture. Internalists countered with various arguments: that brain states will eventually be directly observable with advanced technology, that most cultural anthropologists agree that culture is about [[belief]]s and not artifacts, or that artifacts cannot be replicators in the same sense as mental entities (or DNA) are replicators. The debate became so heated that a 1998 Symposium on Memetics, organised as part of the 15th International Conference on [[Cybernetics]], passed a motion calling for an end to definitional debates. McNamara demonstrated in 2011 that functional connectivity profiling using neuroimaging tools enables the observation of the processing of internal memes, "i-memes", in response to external "e-memes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=Adam|title=Can we Measure Memes?|journal=Frontiers in Evolutionary Neuroscience|date=2011|doi=10.3389/fnevo.2011.00001|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnevo.2011.00001/full|pmc=3118481|pmid=21720531|volume=3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advanced statement of the internalist school came in 2002 with the publication of ''The Electric Meme'', by Robert Aunger, an anthropologist from the [[University of Cambridge]]. Aunger also organised a conference in Cambridge in 1999, at which prominent sociologists and anthropologists were able to give their assessment of the progress made in memetics to that date. This resulted in the publication of ''Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science'', edited by Aunger and with a foreword by Dennett, in 2001&lt;ref&gt;Aunger, Robert. "Darwinizing culture: The status of memetics as a science." (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticism==
{{POV check|section|date=July 2018}}

This evolutionary model of cultural information transfer is based on the concept that units of information, or "memes", have an independent existence, are self-replicating, and are subject to selective evolution through environmental forces.&lt;ref name=Polichak/&gt; Starting from a proposition put forward in the writings of [[Richard Dawkins]], this model has formed the basis of a new area of study, one that looks at the self-replicating units of culture. It has been proposed that just as memes are analogous to genes, memetics is analogous to genetics.

Critics contend that some proponents' assertions are "untested, unsupported or incorrect."&lt;ref name="Polichak"&gt;James W. Polichak, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA664 "Memes as Pseudoscience"], in Michael Shermer, ''Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience''. P. 664f.&lt;/ref&gt; Luis Benitez-Bribiesca, a critic of memetics, calls it "a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[dogma]]" and "a dangerous idea that poses a threat to the serious study of [[consciousness]] and cultural evolution" among other things. As factual criticism, he refers to the lack of a ''code script'' for memes, as the DNA is for genes, and to the fact that the meme mutation mechanism (i.e., an idea going from one brain to another) is too unstable (low replication accuracy and high mutation rate), which would render the evolutionary process chaotic.&lt;ref&gt;Benitez-Bribiesca, Luis (2001): ''[http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/339/33905206.pdf Memetics: A dangerous idea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704104711/http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/339/33905206.pdf |date=2009-07-04 }}''. Interciecia 26: 29–31, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, has been demonstrated (e.g. by Daniel C. Dennett, in ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'') to not be the case, in fact, due to the existence of self-regulating correction mechanisms (vaguely resembling those of gene transcription) enabled by the redundancy and other properties of most meme expression languages, which do stabilize information transfer. (E.g. spiritual narratives—including music and dance forms—can survive in full detail across any number of generations even in cultures with oral tradition only.) Memes for which stable copying methods are available will inevitably get selected for survival more often than those which can only have unstable mutations, therefore going extinct. (Notably, Benitez-Bribiesca's claim of "no code script" is also irrelevant, considering the fact that there is nothing preventing the information contents of memes from being coded, encoded, expressed, preserved or copied in all sorts of different ways throughout their life-cycles.)

Another criticism comes from [[semiotics]], (e.g., Deacon,&lt;ref&gt;[[Terrence Deacon]], The trouble with memes (and what to do about it). ''The Semiotic Review of Books'' 10(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Kull&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kull | first1 = Kalevi | authorlink = Kalevi Kull | year = 2000 | title = Copy versus translate, meme versus sign: development of biological textuality | url = | journal = European Journal for Semiotic Studies | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 101–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) stating that the concept of meme is a primitivized concept of [[Sign (semiotics)|Sign]]. Meme is thus described in memetics as a sign without its triadic nature. In other words, meme is a degenerate sign, which includes only its ability of being copied. Accordingly, in the broadest sense, the objects of copying are memes, whereas the objects of translation and interpretation are signs.
&lt;!-- This last paragraph could be better explained. I'm fimiliar with the subject but was confused. "Tdiadic nature" "degenerate sign" the article would benefit from clarification of these terms. This may not be the proper place to put this but I don't know if there is a discussion page for this article. --&gt;

[[Mary Midgley]] criticises memetics for at least two reasons:&lt;ref&gt;Midgley, Mary. The Solitary Self: Darwin and the Selfish Gene. Acumen, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-84465-253-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "One, culture is not best understood by examining its smallest parts, as culture is pattern-like, comparable to an ocean current. Many more factors, historical and others, should be taken into account than only whatever particle culture is built from. Two, if memes are not thoughts (and thus not cognitive phenomena), as Daniel C. Dennett insists in "[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]", then their [[Ontology|ontological]] status is open to question, and memeticists (who are also [[reductionism|reductionists]]) may be challenged whether memes even exist. Questions can extend to whether the idea of "meme" is itself a meme, or is a true concept. Fundamentally, memetics is an attempt to produce knowledge through organic metaphors, which as such is a questionable research approach, as the application of metaphors has the effect of hiding that which does not fit within the realm of the metaphor. Rather than study actual reality, without preconceptions, memetics, as so many of the socio-biological explanations of society, believe that saying that the apple is like an orange is a valid analysis of the apple."&lt;ref&gt;Stepan, Nancy L. Race and Gender: The Role of Analogy in Science. In Goldberg, David Theo (ed.) The Anatomy of Racism. University of Minnesota Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Jenkins]], Joshua Green, and Sam Ford, in their book ''Spreadable Media'' (2013), criticize Dawkins' idea of the meme, writing that "while the idea of the meme is a compelling one, it may not adequately account for how content circulates through participatory culture." The three authors also criticize other interpretations of memetics, especially those which describe memes as "self-replicating", because they ignore the fact that "culture is a human product and replicates through human agency."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = New York University Press| isbn = 978-0-8147-4350-8 | last1 = Jenkins| first1 = Henry| last2 = Ford| first2 = Sam| last3 = Green| first3 = Joshua| title = Spreadable Media| location = New York ; London| series = Postmillennial pop| date = 2013|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other critics, Maria Kronfeldner has criticized memetics for being based on an allegedly inaccurate analogy with the gene; alternately, she claims it is "heuristically trivial", being a mere redescription of what is already known without offering any useful novelty.&lt;ref&gt;Kronfeldner, Maria. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Darwinian_Creativity_and_Memetics.html?id=VxZOYgEACAAJ] Darwinian Creativity and Memetics. Acumen, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New developments==
{{synthesis|date=June 2015}}
Dawkins  in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' responded that there are actually two different types of memetic processes (controversial and informative). The first is a type of cultural idea, action, or expression, which does have high variance; for instance, a student of his who had inherited some of the mannerisms of [[Wittgenstein]]. However, he also describes a self-correcting meme, highly resistant to mutation. As an example of this, he gives [[origami]] patterns in elementary schools – except in rare cases, the meme is either passed on in the exact sequence of instructions, or (in the case of a forgetful child) terminates. This type of meme tends not to evolve, and to experience profound mutations in the rare event that it does.

Another definition, given by [[Hokky Situngkir]], tried to offer a more rigorous formalism for the meme, ''memeplexes'', and the ''[[deme (biology)|deme]]'', seeing the meme as a cultural unit in a cultural [[complex system]]. It is based on the Darwinian [[genetic algorithm]] with some modifications to account for the different patterns of evolution seen in genes and memes. In the method of memetics as the way to see culture as a [[complex adaptive system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cogprints.org/4772/|title=On Selfish Memes: culture as complex adaptive system|author=Situngkir, Hokky|date=16 Mar 2006|accessdate= 2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; he describes a way to see memetics as an alternative methodology of cultural [[evolution]]. However, there are as many possible definitions that are credited to the word "meme". For example, in the sense of [[computer simulation]] the term ''[[memetic algorithm]]'' is used to define a particular computational viewpoint.

The possibility of quantitative analysis of memes using [[functional neuroimaging|neuroimaging]] tools and the suggestion that such studies have already been done was given by McNamara (2011).&lt;ref name="mcnamara"&gt;{{harvnb|McNamara|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This author proposes hyperscanning (concurrent scanning of two communicating individuals in two separate MRI machines) as a key tool in the future for investigating memetics.

Velikovsky (2013) proposed the "holon" as the structure of the meme,&lt;ref name="StoryAlity"&gt;{{cite web|title=Holonic Structure of the Meme - The Unit of Culture|url=http://storyality.wordpress.com/2013/12/12/storyality-100-the-holonic-structure-of-the-meme-the-unit-of-culture/|work=StoryAlity academic weblog, JT Velikovsky|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; synthesizing the major theories on memes of [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]], [[E.

DiCarlo ({{year needed|date=June 2015}}) has developed the idea of 'memetic equilibrium' to describe a cultural compatible state with [[Homeostasis|biological equilibrium]]. In "Problem Solving and Neurotransmission in the Upper Paleolithic" (in press{{clarify|date=June 2015}}), diCarlo argues that as human consciousness evolved and developed, so too did our ancestors' capacity to consider and attempt to solve environmental problems in more conceptually sophisticated ways. Understood in this way, problem solving amongst a particular group, when considered satisfactory, often produces a feeling of environmental control, stability, in short—memetic equilibrium. 
But the pay-off is not merely practical, providing purely functional utility—it is biochemical and it comes in the form of neurotransmitters. The relationship between a gradually emerging conscious awareness and sophisticated languages in which to formulate representations combined with the desire to maintain biological equilibrium, generated the necessity for equilibrium to fill in conceptual gaps in terms of understanding three very important aspects in the Upper Paleolithic: causality, morality, and mortality. The desire to explain phenomena in relation to maintaining survival and reproductive stasis, generated a normative stance in the minds of our ancestors—Survival/Reproductive Value (or S-R Value).

Houben (2014) has argued on several occasions that the  exceptional resilience of [[Shrauta|Vedic ritual]] and its interaction with a changing ecological and economic environment over several millennia can be profitably dealt with in a ‘cultural evolution’ perspective in which the Vedic mantra is the ‘meme’ or unit of cultural replication.&lt;ref&gt;Jan E.M.

==Applications==
Research methodologies that apply memetics go by many names: Viral marketing, cultural evolution, the history of ideas, social analytics, and more.  Many of these applications do not make reference to the literature on memes directly but are built upon the evolutionary lens of idea propagation that treats semantic units of culture as self-replicating and mutating patterns of information that are assumed to be relevant for scientific study.  For example, the field of public relations is filled with attempts to introduce new ideas and alter social discourse.  One means of doing this is to design a meme and deploy it through various media channels.  One historic example of applied memetics is the PR campaign conducted in 1991 as part of the build-up to the first Gulf War in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prwatch.org/books/tsigfy10.html PR Watch]&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of memetics to a difficult complex social system problem, environmental [[sustainability]], has recently been attempted at thwink.org&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thwink.org/sustain/general/Memetics.htm thwink.org].&lt;/ref&gt; Using meme types and memetic infection in several stock and flow simulation models, Jack Harich has demonstrated several interesting phenomena that are best, and perhaps only, explained by memes. One model, The Dueling Loops of the Political Powerplace,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thwink.org/sustain/articles/005/DuelingLoops_Paper.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the fundamental reason corruption is the norm in politics is due to an inherent structural advantage of one feedback loop pitted against another. Another model, The Memetic Evolution of Solutions to Difficult Problems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thwink.org/sustain/articles/007/MemeticEvolutionOfSolutions.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; uses memes, the [[evolutionary algorithm]], and the [[scientific method]] to show how complex solutions evolve over time and how that process can be improved. The insights gained from these models are being used to engineer memetic solution elements to the sustainability problem.

Another application of memetics in the sustainability space is the crowdfunded Climate Meme Project&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121208023214/http://www.climatememe.org/]&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by Joe Brewer and Balazs Laszlo Karafiath in the spring of 2013. This study was based on a collection of 1000 unique text-based expressions gathered from Twitter, Facebook, and structured interviews with climate activists. The major finding was that the global warming meme is not effective at spreading because it causes emotional duress in the minds of people who learn about it.  Five central tensions were revealed in the discourse about [climate change], each of which represents a resonance point through which dialogue can be engaged.  The tensions were Harmony/Disharmony (whether or not humans are part of the natural world), Survival/Extinction (envisioning the future as either apocalyptic collapse of civilization or total extinction of the human race), Cooperation/Conflict (regarding whether or not humanity can come together to solve global problems), Momentum/Hesitation (about whether or not we are making progress at the collective scale to address climate change), and Elitism/Heretic (a general sentiment that each side of the debate considers the experts of its opposition to be untrustworthy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcoexist.com/1681526/using-memes-to-improve-climate-change-communication Using Memes to Improve Climate Change Communication]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Cullen, in his book ''Contagious Ideas'',&lt;ref name="Contagious Ideas"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Cullen | first1 = Ben | title = Contagious Ideas: On evolution, culture, archaeology, and Cultural Virus Theory | publisher = [[Oxbow Books]] | date = 2000 | location =Oxford and Oakville | isbn = 1-84217-014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought the idea of the meme into the discipline of archaeology. He coined the term "Cultural Virus Theory", and used it to try to anchor archaeological theory in a neo-Darwinian paradigm. Archaeological memetics could assist the application of the meme concept to material culture in particular.

[[Francis Heylighen]] of the [[Center Leo Apostel for Interdisciplinary Studies]] has postulated what he calls "memetic selection criteria". These criteria opened the way to a specialized field of ''applied memetics'' to find out if these selection criteria could stand the test of [[quantitative research|quantitative analyses]]. In 2003 Klaas Chielens carried out these tests in a Masters thesis project on the testability of the selection criteria.

In ''Selfish Sounds and Linguistic Evolution'',&lt;ref name="Selfish Sounds"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ritt | first1 = Nikolaus | title = Selfish Sounds and Linguistic Evolution: A Darwinian Approach to Language Change | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | date = July 5, 2004 | location = New York | accessdate = | isbn = 978-0-521-82671-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian linguist Nikolaus Ritt has attempted to operationalise memetic concepts and use them for the explanation of long term sound changes and change conspiracies in early English. It is argued that a generalised Darwinian framework for handling cultural change can provide explanations where established, speaker centred approaches fail to do so. The book makes comparatively concrete suggestions about the possible material structure of memes, and provides two empirically rich case studies.

Australian academic S.J. Whitty has argued that [[project management]] is a memeplex with the language and stories of its practitioners at its core.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv.php?pid=UQ:8801&amp;dsID=sjw_ijpm_05.pdf A Memetic Paradigm of Project Management] (International Journal of Project Management, 23 (8) 575-583)&lt;/ref&gt; This radical approach sees a project and its management as an illusion; a human construct about a collection of feelings, expectations, and sensations, which are created, fashioned, and labeled by the human brain. Whitty's approach requires project managers to consider that the reasons for using project management are not consciously driven to maximize profit, and are encouraged to consider project management as naturally occurring, self-serving, evolving process which shapes organizations for its own purpose.

Swedish political scientist Mikael Sandberg argues against "[[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]]" interpretations of institutional and technological evolution and studies creative innovation of [[information technologies]] in governmental and private organizations in Sweden in the 1990s from a memetic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;"The Evolution of IT Innovations in Swedish Organizations: A Darwinian Critique of ‘Lamarckian’ Institutional Economics", '''Journal of Evolutionary Economics''', vol. 17, No. 1 (Feb 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing the effects of active ("Lamarckian") IT strategy versus user–producer interactivity (Darwinian co-evolution), evidence from Swedish organizations shows that co-evolutionary interactivity is almost four times as strong a factor behind IT creativity as the "Lamarckian" IT strategy.

==Terminology==
*'''[[Memeplex]]''' – (an abbreviation of meme-complex) is a collection or grouping of memes that have evolved into a mutually supportive or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Blackmore, Susan, 1999, The Meme Machine, Oxford University Press, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-19-850365-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, a meme-complex is a set of ideas that reinforce each other. Meme-complexes are roughly analogous to the symbiotic collection of individual [[gene]]s that make up the genetic codes of biological organisms. An example of a memeplex would be a [[religion]].
*'''[[Meme pool]]''' – a population of interbreeding memes.
*'''[[Memetic engineering]]''' – The process of deliberately creating memes, using engineering principles.
*'''[[Memetic algorithms]]''' – an approach to [[evolutionary computation]] that attempts to emulate cultural evolution in order to solve [[optimization problem]]s.
*'''Memotype''' – is the actual information-content of a meme.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Grant. ''A Memetic Lexicon''. Montreal. 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Memeoid''' – is a [[neologism]] for people who have been taken over by a meme to the extent that their own survival becomes inconsequential. Examples include [[kamikaze]]s, [[suicide bomber]]s and [[cult]] members who commit mass suicide. The term was apparently coined by H. [[Keith Henson]] in "Memes, L5 and the Religion of the Space Colonies," ''L5 News'', September 1985 pp.&amp;nbsp;5–8,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfpm.org/~majordom/memetics/2000/16177.html Two early meme papers of historical interest (1a)]&lt;/ref&gt; and referenced in the expanded second edition of [[Richard Dawkins]]' book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;330). But in the strict sense all people are essentially ''memeoid'', since no distinction can be made if one uses language, or memes use their host. In ''[[The Electronic Revolution]]'' [[William S. Burroughs]] writes: "the word has not been recognised as a virus because it has achieved a state of stable symbiosis with the host."
*'''Memetic equilibrium''' – refers to the cultural equivalent of species biological equilibrium. It is that which humans strive for in terms of personal value with respect to cultural artefacts and ideas. The term was coined by Christopher diCarlo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christopher W. diCarlo |title=How Problem Solving and Neurotransmission in the Upper Paleolithic led to The Emergence and Maintenance of Memetic Equilibrium in Contemporary World Religions |url=http://www.politicsandculture.org/2010/04/27/how-problem-solving-and-neurotransmission-in-the-upper-paleolithic-led-to-the-emergence-and-maintenance-of-memetic-equilibrium-in-contemporary-world-religions/ |journal=Politics and Culture |issue=Special Evolutionary Issue |date=April 27, 2010 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4255">In [[behavioral finance]], the '''ostrich effect''' is the attempt made by investors to avoid negative financial information. The name comes from the common (but false) legend that [[ostrich]]es bury their heads in the sand to avoid danger.

Originally the term was coined by {{harvtxt|Galai|Sade|2006}}, and was defined as "the avoidance of apparently risky financial situations by pretending they do not exist", but since {{harvtxt|Karlsson|Loewenstein|Seppi|2009}} it took the slightly broader meaning of "avoiding to expose oneself to [financial] information that one fear may cause psychological discomfort". For example, in the event of a market downturn, people may choose to avoid monitoring their investments or seeking out further financial news.

==Research==
{{harvtxt|Galai|Sade|2006}} explain differences in returns in the [[fixed income]] market by using a psychological explanation, which they name the "ostrich effect," attributing this anomalous behavior to an aversion to receiving information on potential interim losses. They also provide evidence that the entrance to a leading financial portal in Israel is positively related to the equity market. Later, research by {{harvtxt|Karlsson|Loewenstein|Seppi|2009}} determined that people in [[Scandinavia]] looked up the value of their investments 50% to 80% less often during bad markets.

{{harvtxt|Galai|Sade|2006}} also found that investors prefer financial investments where the risk is unreported over those with a similar risk-return profile and frequently reported risks, saying that investors are willing to pay a premium for "the bliss of ignorance".

==Criticism==
A study by {{harvtxt|Gherzi et al.|2014}} showed no perceivable attempt by investors to ignore or avoid negative information, but instead found that "investors increase their portfolio monitoring following both positive and daily negative market returns, behaving more like hyper-vigilant meerkats than head-in-the-sand ostriches". They dubbed this phenomenon "[[meerkat]] effect".

{{italic title}}
'''''{{lang|fr|Peine forte et dure}}''''' ([[Law French]] for "hard and forceful punishment") was a method of [[torture]] formerly used in the [[common law]] legal system, in which a [[defendant]] who refused to [[plea]]d ("stood mute") would be subjected to having heavier and heavier stones placed upon his or her chest until a plea was entered, or he/she died.

Many defendants charged with capital offences would refuse to plead in order to avoid forfeiture of property. If the defendant pleaded either guilty or not guilty and was executed, their heirs would inherit nothing, their property [[escheat]]ing to the Crown. If they refused to plead their heirs would inherit their estate, even if they died in the process.

==Legal background==
[[File:Engraving for the Malefactor's Register the punishment formerly inflicted on those who refused pleading to an indictment.jpg|left|thumb|An engraving of the ''peine forte et dure'' inflicted on a prisoner (appearing in the "[[The Newgate Calendar|Malefactor's register]]" of 1780)]]
The common law courts originally took a very limited view of their own [[jurisdiction]]. They considered themselves to lack jurisdiction over a defendant until he had voluntarily submitted to it by entering a plea seeking judgment from the court.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] and [[Frederic William Maitland]], ''[[The History of English Law]]'', v. 2, pp. 650–651 (Cambridge; 1968; {{ISBN|0-521-07062-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously, a [[criminal justice]] system that could punish only those who had volunteered for possible punishment was unworkable; a means was needed to coerce them into entering a plea.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[William Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1769), vol. 4, pp. *319-324&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, individuals were frequently tried under [[Admiralty law]], as observed by [[Henry de Bracton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae |url=http://bracton.law.harvard.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Standing Mute Act 1275", part of [[Statute of Westminster 1275|Statute of Westminster of 1275]] of [[Edward I of England]], states:
{{quote|It is provided also, That notorious Felons, which openly be of evil name, and will not put themselves in Enquests of Felonies that Men shall charge them with before the Justices at the King's suit, shall have strong and hard Imprisonment (prison forte et dure), as they which refuse to stand to the common Law of the Land : But this is not to be understood of such prisoners as be taken of light suspicion.&lt;ref name=tyburn&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/tyburntreeitshis00markuoft/tyburntreeitshis00markuoft_djvu.txt "TYBURN TREE: ITS HISTORY AND ANNALS"], Alfred Marks, 1908 ''(at archive.org)''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It appears to have initially meant imprisonment under harsh conditions:
{{quote|in the worst place in the prison, upon the bare ground continually, night and day; that they eat only bread made of barley or bran, and that they drink not the day they eat ...&lt;ref name=tyburn /&gt;}}
By the reign of [[Elizabeth I]] it took the form of "pressing" the accused with weights.&lt;ref name=tyburn /&gt; 
 
The procedure was recorded by a 15th-century witness as follows:
{{quote|he will lie upon his back, with his head covered and his feet, and one arm will be drawn to one quarter of the house with a cord, and the other arm to another quarter, and in the same manner it will be done with his legs; and let there be laid upon his body iron and stone, as much as he can bear, or more ...&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=veURAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=%22laid+in+some+low+dark+house%22#PPA218,M1 Curiosities of Cowell's "Interpreter"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Pressing to death" might take several days, and not necessarily with a continued increase in the load. The Frenchman Guy Miege, who from 1668 taught languages in London,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ed89c430-0517-4065-b717-0243fd11b368 The enterprising and tenacious Guy Miège: four dictionaries from 1677 to 1688]&lt;/ref&gt; says the following about the English practice:&lt;ref&gt;Miege, G.:"[https://books.google.no/books?id=b3gZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:Pu8Sknlj31oC&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VAMaUeXcJ8jR4QSm1YGoCg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The present state of Great-Britain and Ireland]" London 1715, p.294&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote| For such as stand Mute at their Trial, and refuse to answer Guilty, or Not Guilty, Pressing to Death is the proper Punishment. In such a Case the Prisoner is laid in a low dark Room in the Prison, all naked but his Privy Members, his Back upon the bare Ground his Arms and Legs stretched with Cords, and fastned to the several Quarters of the Room. This done, he has a great Weight of Iron and Stone laid upon him. His Diet, till he dies, is of three Morsels of Barley bread without Drink the next Day; and if he lives beyond it, he has nothing daily, but as much foul Water as he can drink three several Time, and that without any Bread: Which grievous Death some resolute Offenders have chosen, to save their Estates to their Children. But, in case of High Treason, the Criminal's Estate is forfeited to the Sovereign, as in all capital Crimes, notwithstanding his being pressed to Death.}}

''{{lang|fr|Peine forte et dure}}'' was abolished in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1772, with the last known actual use of the practice having been in 1741.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsu.edu/~crimdo/forfeiture.html Drug Control and Asset Seizures: a review of the history of forfeiture in England and colonial America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970428075512/http://www.fsu.edu/~crimdo/forfeiture.html |date=28 April 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1772 refusing to plead was deemed to be equivalent to pleading guilty, but this was changed in 1827 to being deemed a plea of not guilty &amp;ndash; which is now the case in all common law jurisdictions.

==Cases==
[[File:Giles Corey restored.jpg|thumb|[[Giles Corey]] was pressed to death during the [[Salem Witch Trials]] in the 1690s.]]
The most famous case in England was that of [[Roman Catholic]] [[martyr]] [[Margaret Clitherow|St Margaret Clitherow]], who (in order to avoid a trial in which her own children would be obliged to give evidence and could be tortured) was pressed to death on 25 March 1586, after refusing to plead to the charge of having harboured Catholic (then outlawed) [[priest]]s in her house.

Several hardened criminals, including [[William Spiggot]] (1721) and Edward Burnworth, lasted a half hour under {{convert|400|lb|kg}} before pleading to the indictment.

In America, [[Giles Corey]] was pressed to death between September 17 and September 19, 1692, during the [[Salem witch trials]], after he refused to enter a plea in the judicial proceeding. According to legend, his last words as he was being crushed were "More weight", and he was thought to have been killed as the weight was applied. This is referred to in Arthur Miller's political drama ''[[The Crucible]]'', where Giles Corey is pressed to death after refusing to plead "aye or nay" to the charge of witchcraft. In the film version of this play, the screenplay of which was also by Miller, Corey is crushed to death for refusing to reveal the name of a source of information.

[[File:Raymond Kurzweil, Stanford 2006 (square crop).jpg|thumb|Ray Kurzweil in 2006]]

American author, inventor and [[futurist]] [[Raymond Kurzweil]] has become well known for his predictions about [[artificial intelligence]] and the human species, mainly concerning the [[Technological Singularity]]. He predicts that Artificial Intelligence would outsmart the human brain in computational capabilities by mid-21st century. His first book, ''[[The Age of Intelligent Machines]]'', published in 1990, put forth his theories on the results of the increasing use of technology and predicted the explosive growth in the internet, among other predictions. Later works, 1999's ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'' and 2005's ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'' outlined other theories including the rise of clouds of nano-robots ([[nanobots]]) called [[utility fog|foglets]] and the development of Human Body 2.0 and 3.0, whereby [[nanotechnology]] is incorporated into many internal organs.

==Accuracy of predictions==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

===''The Age of Intelligent Machines''===
Kurzweil's first book, ''[[The Age of Intelligent Machines]]'', was published in 1990. It forecast the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|demise of the already crumpling Soviet Union]] due to new technologies such as cellular phones and fax machines disempowering authoritarian governments by removing state control over the flow of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Age of Intelligent Machines|date=1990|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-262-11121-7|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] told Kurzweil that emerging decentralized electronic communication "was a big factor" for fostering democracy in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Renee Blodgett |url=http://www.weblogtheworld.com/countries/northern-america/ray-kurzweil-on-gorbachev/ |title=Ray Kurzweil on Gorbachev |publisher=We Blog The World |date=April 20, 2005 |accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurzweil extrapolated the performance of chess software to predict that computers would beat the best human players "by the year 2000".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Age of Intelligent Machines|date=1990|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-262-11121-7|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1997 chess World Champion [[Garry Kasparov]] was defeated by IBM's [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] computer in a well-publicized chess tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weber|first=Bruce|title=Swift and Slashing, Computer Topples Kasparav|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/12/nyregion/swift-and-slashing-computer-topples-kasparov.html|accessdate=February 13, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 12, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps most significantly, Kurzweil foresaw the explosive growth in worldwide Internet use that began in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coffman|first=K.G|title=Growth of the Internet|date=2001|publisher=AT&amp;T Labs Research|url=http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/oft.internet.growth.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the publication of ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'', there were only 2.6 million Internet users in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_2001_Feb/ai_70910777/pg_3 | work=UNESCO Courier | title=Fleeing the dot.com era – decline in Internet usage | first=Sally | last=Wyatt | date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the medium was often unreliable outside academic, military, corporate and other heavily invested settings, difficult for non-technical users to use, and mostly lacking a broad range of content. He also stated that the Internet would explode not only in the number of users but in content as well, eventually granting users access "to international networks of libraries, data bases, and information services".{{Cite quote|date=February 2013}} Additionally, Kurzweil correctly foresaw that the preferred mode of Internet access would inevitably be through wireless systems, and he was also correct to estimate that the latter would become practical for widespread use in the early 21st century.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===''The Age of Spiritual Machines''===
In 1999, Kurzweil published a second book titled ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'', which goes into more depth explaining his futurist ideas. The third and final section of the book is devoted to elucidating the specific course of technological advancements Kurzweil believes the world will experience over the next century. Titled "To Face the Future", the section is divided into four chapters respectively named "2009", "2019", "2029", and "2099". For every chapter, Kurzweil issues predictions about what life and technology will be like in that year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Kurzweil restated his earlier prediction from ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'' regarding the advent of pocket-sized, cheap, text-to-speech converters for the blind by 2009. The [[K-NFB Reader|"Kurzweil-National Federation of the Blind Reader" (K-NFB Reader)]] was introduced in 2005 at a price of $3,495. The device was portable, but not the cheap, pocket-sized device of the prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The KNFB Reader becomes the Property of the Nation's Blind|url=https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/bm/bm15/bm1506/bm150603.htm|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, a software version for the (pocket-sized) [[Nokia N82]] smartphone was available for $1,595.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KNFB Reader Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://knfbreader.com/faq.php|archivedate=February 8, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208144803/http://knfbreader.com/faq.php|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version for [[iOS]] phones was released for $99 in 2014 and [[Android_(operating_system)|Android]] for $75 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.inclusiveandroid.com/content/award-winning-text-recognition-app-gives-blind-access-print-now-available-android&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Singularity Is Near''===
While this book focuses on the future of technology and the human race as ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'' and ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'' did, Kurzweil makes very few concrete, short-term predictions in ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'', though longer-term visions abound.

Kurzweil predicted that, in 2005, supercomputers with the ''computational capacities'' to simulate [[protein folding]] will be introduced.  In 2010, a supercomputer simulated protein folding for a very small protein at an atomic level over a period of a millisecond.  The protein folded and unfolded, with the results closely matching experimental data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heidi Ledford |title=Supercomputer sets protein-folding record |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101014/full/news.2010.541.html |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date = October 2010|accessdate=January 8, 2011 |doi=10.1038/news.2010.541}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The biyearly protein structure prediction contest [[CASP]] shows that the current algorithms for structure prediction are still impractical for determining the previously unknown structure of most proteins.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Other sources===
In an October 2002 article published on [http://www.Kurzweilai.net his website], Kurzweil stated that "[[Deep Fritz]]-like chess programs running on ordinary personal computers will routinely defeat all humans later in this decade."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0527.html?printable=1 Deep Fritz Draws: Are Humans Getting Smarter, or Are Computers Getting Stupider?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616094405/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0527.html?printable=1 |date=June 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Fritz is a computer chess program—generally considered superior to the older [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]] — that has defeated or tied a number of human chess masters and opposing chess programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/player/deep_fritz.html The chess games of Deep Fritz (Computer)].

===Ray Kurzweil's response===
According to Ray Kurzweil, 89 out of 108 predictions he made were entirely correct by the end of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nextbigfuture.com/2010/01/ray-kurzweil-responds-to-issue-of.html Ray Kurzweil Responds to the Issue of Accuracy of His Predictions], Next Big Future, January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Kurzweil later released a more detailed analysis of the accuracy of his predictions up to 2009, arguing that most were correct.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil, Ray (October 2010) [http://www.kurzweilai.net/predictions/download.php How My Predictions Are Faring].

*Personal worn computers provide monitoring of body functions, automated identity and directions for navigation.
*Many devices offer high-speed network access via wireless technology.&lt;ref name="Penguin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|title=The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence|date=1999|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780140282023|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Digital products such as books, songs, games, movies and software are typically acquired as files via a wireless network and have no physical object associated with them.&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt;
*Cables are disappearing. Computer peripherals use wireless communication.
*People can talk to their computer to give commands.
*Computer displays built into eyeglasses for [[augmented reality]] are used.
*Computers can [[face recognition|recognize their owner's face]] from a picture or video.
*[[3D integrated circuit|Three-dimensional chips]] are commonly used.
*Sound producing speakers are being replaced with very small chip-based devices that can place high resolution sound anywhere in three-dimensional space.
*A $1,000 computer can perform a trillion calculations per second.
*Supercomputers have been built that can operate at 20 petaflops (roughly the hardware-equivalent of the human brain according to Kurzweil).
*Consumer-level computers across the world can network together to form decentralized supercomputers, many of which have the computational capacity of the human brain.
*There is increasing interest in massively parallel neural nets, genetic algorithms and other forms of "chaotic" or complexity theory computing.
*Research has been initiated on reverse engineering the brain through both destructive and non-invasive scans.
*Autonomous nano-engineered machines have been demonstrated and include their own computational controls.
*Digital documents routinely display moving images and sounds.
*Artificial voices sound fully human.
*Phones can translate spoken sentences to different languages and read them back aloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|title=The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence|date=1999|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780140282023|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Telephone communication is mostly wireless.
*Cell phones display high resolution images. Users can engage in audio-video teleconferences.
*High resolution audio-visual cybersex is common, aided by falling costs of high-speed internet and computer hardware.
*At least 50% of all transactions are conducted over the internet.
*Personal artificial digital assistants are in widespread use. They can understand spoken language, look up answers to questions, set appointments, conduct transactions, tell jokes, and more.
*An increasing share of the population is working from home and while traveling.
*The typical home has over 100 computers in it, many of which are embedded in appliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|title=The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence|date=1999|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-14-028202-3|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Though not yet ubiquitous, many households have one or more robots that perform some type of housekeeping.
*People often play music alongside digital musicians. (In "How My Predictions Are Faring" written in 2010, Kurzweil cited ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and Apple's ''Magic [[GarageBand]] Jam'' as two examples.)
*Audio-visual [[virtual reality]] has entered the mass market. Users can digitally tour real locations or play in highly immersive fantasy worlds. Tactile (haptic) VR technology is still primitive however.
*Militaries rely heavily on armed unmanned airborne devices.
*Death rates for cancer and heart disease have continued to fall as a result of improvements in medical technology.
*Telemedicine is common. Devices monitor and relay health-related data of many patients and send that information to doctors remotely. Teleconferencing between doctor and patient is also popular.
*Computers and medical software are capable enough at image and pattern recognition that they are routinely used to [[computer-aided diagnosis|help diagnose diseases]] by analyzing scans of patients.
*Doctors and medical students often train in virtual reality environments, which include haptic feedback and simulated patients.

====2019====
*The computational capacity of a $4,000 computing device (in 1999 dollars) is approximately equal to the computational capability of the [[human brain]] (20 quadrillion calculations per second).
*The summed computational powers of all computers is comparable to the total brainpower of the human race.
*Computers are embedded everywhere in the environment (inside of furniture, jewelry, walls, clothing, etc.).
*People experience 3-D virtual reality through glasses and contact lenses that beam images directly to their retinas (retinal display). Coupled with an auditory source (headphones), users can remotely communicate with other people and access the Internet.
*These special glasses and contact lenses can deliver "augmented reality" and "virtual reality" in three different ways. First, they can project "[[head-up display|heads-up-displays]]" (HUDs) across the user's field of vision, superimposing images that stay in place in the environment regardless of the user's perspective or orientation. Second, virtual objects or people could be rendered in fixed locations by the glasses, so when the user's eyes look elsewhere, the objects appear to stay in their places. Third, the devices could block out the "real" world entirely and fully immerse the user in a virtual reality environment.
*People communicate with their computers [[voice user interface|via two-way speech]] and [[gesture recognition|gestures]] instead of with keyboards. Furthermore, most of this interaction occurs through computerized assistants with different personalities that the user can select or customize. Dealing with computers thus becomes more and more like dealing with a human being.
*Most business transactions or information inquiries involve dealing with a simulated person.
*Most people own more than one PC, though the concept of what a "computer" is has changed considerably: Computers are no longer limited in design to laptops or CPUs contained in a large box connected to a monitor. Instead, devices with computer capabilities come in all sorts of unexpected shapes and sizes.
*Cables connecting computers and peripherals have almost completely disappeared.
*Rotating computer hard drives are no longer used.
*Three-dimensional nanotube lattices are the dominant computing substrate.
*Massively parallel neural nets and genetic algorithms are in wide use.
*Destructive scans of the brain and noninvasive brain scans have allowed scientists to understand the brain much better. The algorithms that allow the relatively small genetic code of the brain to construct a much more complex organ are being transferred into computer neural nets.
*Pinhead-sized cameras are everywhere.
*Nanotechnology is more capable and is in use for specialized applications, yet it has not yet made it into the mainstream. "Nanoengineered machines" begin to be used in manufacturing.
*Thin, lightweight, handheld displays with very high resolutions are the preferred means for viewing documents. The aforementioned computer eyeglasses and contact lenses are also used for this same purpose, and all download the information wirelessly.
*Computers have made paper books and documents almost completely obsolete.
*Most learning is accomplished through intelligent, adaptive courseware presented by computer-simulated teachers. In the learning process, human adults fill the counselor and mentor roles instead of being academic instructors. These assistants are often not physically present, and help students remotely.
*Students still learn together and socialize, though this is often done remotely via computers.
*All students have access to computers.
*Most human workers spend the majority of their time acquiring new skills and knowledge.
*Blind people wear special glasses that interpret the real world for them through speech. Sighted people also use these glasses to amplify their own abilities.
*Retinal and neural implants also exist, but are in limited use because they are less useful.
*Deaf people use special glasses that convert speech into text or signs, and music into images or tactile sensations. Cochlear and other implants are also widely used.
*People with spinal cord injuries can walk and climb steps using computer-controlled nerve stimulation and exoskeletal robotic walkers.
*Computers are also found inside of some humans in the form of cybernetic implants. These are most commonly used by disabled people to regain normal physical faculties (e.g. Retinal implants allow the blind to see and spinal implants coupled with mechanical legs allow the paralyzed to walk).
*Language translating machines are of much higher quality, and are routinely used in conversations.
*Effective language technologies (natural language processing, [[speech recognition]], speech synthesis) exist.
*Anyone can wirelessly access the internet with wearable devices such as computerized glasses, contacts, and watches.
*Traditional computers and communication devices such as desktop PCs, laptops, and cell phones still exist, but most of their functions can be performed by wearable gadgets. Examples include reading books, listening to music, watching movies, playing games, and teleconferencing.
*Devices that deliver sensations to the skin surface of their users (e.g. tight body suits and gloves) are also sometimes used in virtual reality to complete the experience. "Virtual sex"—in which two people are able to have sex with each other through virtual reality, or in which a human can have sex with a "simulated" partner that only exists on a computer—becomes a reality.
*Just as visual- and auditory virtual reality have come of age, [[haptic technology]] has fully matured and is completely convincing, yet requires the user to enter a V.R. booth. It is commonly used for computer sex and remote medical examinations. It is the preferred sexual medium since it is safe and enhances the experience.
*Worldwide economic growth has continued. There has not been a global economic collapse.
*The vast majority of business interactions occur between humans and simulated retailers, or between a human's virtual personal assistant and a simulated retailer.
*Household robots are ubiquitous and reliable.
*Computers do most of the vehicle driving—-humans are in fact prohibited from driving on highways unassisted. Furthermore, when humans do take over the wheel, the onboard computer system constantly monitors their actions and takes control whenever the human drives recklessly. As a result, there are very few transportation accidents.
*Most roads now have automated driving systems—networks of monitoring and communication devices that allow computer-controlled automobiles to safely navigate.
*Prototype personal flying vehicles using microflaps exist. They are also primarily computer-controlled.
*Humans are beginning to have deep relationships with automated personalities, which hold some advantages over human partners. The depth of some computer personalities convinces some people that they should be accorded more rights.
*Most decisions made by humans involve consultation with machine intelligence. For example, a doctor may seek the advice of a digital assistant. A lawyer might utilize a virtual researcher. Or a shopper may receive recommendations from a software program that has learned his or her shopping habits.
*While a growing number of humans believe that their computers and the simulated personalities they interact with are intelligent to the point of human-level consciousness, experts dismiss the possibility that any could pass the Turing Test.
*Human-robot relationships begin as simulated personalities become more convincing.
*Interaction with virtual personalities becomes a primary interface.
*Public places and workplaces are ubiquitously monitored to prevent violence and all actions are recorded permanently. Personal privacy is a major political issue, and some people protect themselves with unbreakable computer codes.
*The basic needs of the underclass are met. (Not specified if this pertains only to the developed world or to all countries)
*Virtual artists—creative computers capable of making their own art and music—emerge in all fields of the arts.
*Most flying weapons are bird-sized robots. Some are as small as insects.
*Average life expectancy is over 100.
*Computerized watches, clothing, and jewelry can monitor the wearers health continuously. They can detect many types of diseases and offer recommendations for treatment.

====2029====
*A $1,000 personal computer is 1,000 times more powerful than the human brain.
*The vast majority of computation is done by computers and not by human brains.
*Further progress has been made in understanding the secrets of the human brain. Hundreds of distinct sub-regions with specialized functions have been identified. Some of the algorithms that code for development of these regions have been deciphered and incorporated into neural net computers.
*Massively parallel neural nets, which are constructed through reverse-engineering the human brain, are in common use.
*The eyeglasses and headphones that used to deliver virtual reality are now obsolete thanks to computer implants that go into the eyes and ears. The implants are either permanent or removable. They allow direct interface with computers, communications and Internet-based applications. The implants are also capable of recording what the user sees and hears.
*Computer implants designed for direct connection to the brain are also available. They are capable of augmenting natural senses and of enhancing higher brain functions like memory, learning speed and overall intelligence.
*Computers are now capable of learning and creating new knowledge entirely on their own and with no human help. By scanning the enormous content of the Internet, some computers "know" literally every single piece of public information (every scientific discovery, every book and movie, every public statement, etc.) generated by human beings.
*Direct brain implants allow users to enter full-immersion virtual reality—with complete sensory stimulation—without any external equipment. People can have their minds in a totally different place at any moment. This technology is in widespread use.
*Most communication occurs between humans and machines as opposed to human-to-human.
*The manufacturing, agricultural and transportation sectors of the economy are almost entirely automated and employ very few humans. Across the world, poverty, war and disease are almost nonexistent thanks to technology alleviating want.
*The rise of Artificial Intelligence creates a real "[[robot rights]]" movement, and there is open, public debate over what sorts of civil rights and legal protections machines should have. The existence of humans with heavy levels of cybernetic augmentation and of larger numbers of other people with less extreme cybernetic implants lead to further arguments over what constitutes a "human being."
*Although computers routinely pass the Turing Test, controversy still persists over whether machines are as intelligent as humans in all areas.
*Artificial Intelligences claim to be conscious and openly petition for recognition of the fact. Most people admit and accept this new truth.
* Reverse engineering of the human brain completed
* Non-biological intelligence combines the subtlety and pattern recognition strength of human intelligence, with the speed, memory, and knowledge sharing of machine intelligence
* Non-biological intelligence will continue to grow exponentially whereas biological intelligence is effectively fixed in its rate of growth

====2049====
*Food is commonly "assembled" by nanomachines. This food is externally indistinguishable from "natural" food, but it can be made more wholesome since production can be controlled at the molecular level. This technology decouples food production from climate conditions and the availability of natural resources.
*The distinction between virtual reality and "real" reality becomes confounded as [[Utility fog|foglets]] come into common use, allowing immediate assembly or disassembly of all sorts of physical objects.

====2072====
*[[Picoengineering]] (technology on the scale of trillionths of a meter) becomes practical.

====2099====
*The human brain has been completely reverse engineered and all aspects of its functioning are understood.
*Natural human thinking possesses no advantages over computer minds.
*Machines have attained equal legal status with humans.
*Humans and machines merge in the physical and mental realms. Cybernetic brain implants enable humans to fuse their minds with AI's.
*In consequence, clear distinctions between humans and machines no longer exist.
*Most conscious beings lack a permanent physical form.
*The vast majority of the Earth's sentient beings are AI's that exist entirely as thinking computer programs capable of instantly moving from one computer to another across the Internet (or whatever equivalent exists in 2099). These computer-based beings are capable of manifesting themselves at will in the physical world by creating or taking over robotic bodies, with individual AI's also being capable of controlling multiple bodies at once.
*Individual beings merge and separate constantly, making it impossible to determine how many “people” there are on Earth.
*This new plasticity of consciousness and ability for beings to join minds seriously alters the nature of self-identity.
*The majority of interpersonal interactions occur in virtual environments. Actually having two people physically meet in the real world to have a conversation or transact business without any technological interference is very rare.
*Organic human beings are a small minority of the intelligent life forms on Earth. Even among the remaining ''Homo sapiens'', the use of computerized implants that heavily augment normal abilities is ubiquitous and accepted as normal. The small fraction of humans who opt to remain "natural" and unmodified effectively exist on a lower and more limited plane of consciousness from everyone else, and thus find it impossible to fully interact with AI's and highly modified humans.
*"Natural" humans are protected from extermination. In spite of their shortcomings and frailties, humans are respected by AI's for giving rise to the machines.
*Since knowledge and skills can be instantly downloaded and comprehended by most intelligent beings, the process of learning is compressed into an instantaneous affair instead of the years-long struggle normal humans experience. Free from this time-consuming burden, AI's now focus their energies on making new discoveries and contributions.
*AI's are capable of dividing their attention and energies in countless directions, allowing one being to manage a multitude of endeavors simultaneously.
*Femtoengineering (engineering on the scale of one thousandth of a trillionth of a meter) might be possible.
*AI's communicate via a shared electronic language.
*Artwork and music created by machines encompasses areas of the light spectrum and frequencies of sounds that normal humans cannot perceive.
*Money has deflated in value, meaning all sorts of goods and services have become cheaper.
*Some humans at least as old as the Baby Boomers are still alive and well.
*Computer viruses are a major threat since most intelligent beings are software-based.
*AI's frequently make "backup copies" of themselves, guaranteeing a sort of immortality should the original AI be killed.
*The concept of "life expectancy" has become irrelevant to humans and machines thanks to medical immortality and advanced computers.
*The pace of technological change continues to accelerate as the 22nd century nears.

====Thousands of years from now====
*"Intelligent beings consider the fate of all the Universe."

===''The Singularity is Near'' (2005)===
{{Page numbers needed|section|date=July 2016}}

====2010====
*Supercomputers will have the same raw computing power as human brains, though the software to emulate human thinking on those computers does not yet exist. ([[IBM Sequoia]])
*Computers will start to disappear as distinct physical objects, meaning many will have nontraditional shapes or will be embedded in clothing and everyday objects.
*Full-immersion audio-visual virtual reality will exist.

====2015====
*By now, it is likely that "clean a house" will be within the capabilities of a household robot.

====2018====
*10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; bits (=10 TB) of computer memory—roughly the equivalent of the memory space in a single human brain—will cost $1000.
10 terabytes of storage (not memory) have been already reached for $535 (Seagate Barracuda 10TB) in mid 2016.

====2010s====
* The decade in which "Bridge Two", the revolution in Genetics/Biotechnology, is to reach its peak. During the 2020s, humans will have the means of changing their genes; not just "[[designer babies]]" will be feasible, but designer baby boomers through the rejuvenation of all of one's body's tissues and organs by transforming one's skin cells into youthful versions of every other cell type. People will be able to "reprogram" their own biochemistry away from disease and aging, radically extending life expectancy.
*Computers become smaller and increasingly integrated into everyday life.
*More and more computer devices will be used as miniature web servers, and more will have their resources pooled for computation.
*High-quality broadband Internet access will become available almost everywhere.
*Eyeglasses that beam images onto the users' retinas to produce virtual reality will be developed. They will also come with speakers or headphone attachments that will complete the experience with sounds.  These eyeglasses will become a new medium for [[advertising]] which will be wirelessly transmitted to them as one walks by various business establishments. This was fictionalized in [[Dennō Coil]].
*The VR glasses will also have built-in computers featuring "virtual assistant" programs that can help the user with various daily tasks. 
*Virtual assistants would be capable of multiple functions. One useful function would be real-time language translation in which words spoken in a foreign language would be translated into text that would appear as subtitles to a user wearing the glasses. 
*Cell phones will be built into clothing and will be able to project sounds directly into the ears of their users. 
*Advertisements will utilize a new technology whereby two ultrasonic beams can be targeted to intersect at a specific point, delivering a localized sound message that only a single person can hear.

====2020s====
* The decade in which "Bridge Three", the revolution in Nanotechnology, is to begin: allowing humans to vastly overcome the inherent limitations of biology, as no matter how much humanity fine-tunes its biology, they will never be as capable otherwise. This decade also marks the revolution in Robotics ([[Artificial general intelligence|Strong AI]]), as an AI is expected to pass the [[Turing test]] by the last year of the decade (2029), meaning it can pass for a human being (though the first A.I. is likely to be the equivalent of an average, educated human). What follows then will be an era of consolidation in which nonbiological intelligence will undergo exponential growth (Runaway AI), eventually leading to the extraordinary expansion contemplated by the Singularity, in which human intelligence is multiplied by billions by the mid-2040s.
*Early in this decade, humanity will have the requisite hardware to emulate human intelligence within a $1000 personal computer, followed shortly by effective software models of human intelligence toward the middle of the decade: this will be enabled through the continuing exponential growth of brain-scanning technology, which is doubling in bandwidth, temporal and spatial resolution every year, and will be greatly amplified with nanotechnology, allowing us to have a detailed understanding of all the regions of the human brain and to aid in developing human-level machine intelligence by the end of this decade.
*Computers less than 100&amp;nbsp;nm in size will be possible.
*As one of their first practical applications, [[nanomachines]] are used for medical purposes.
*Highly advanced medical [[nanobots]] will perform detailed [[Neuroimaging|brainscans]] on live patients.
*Accurate computer simulations of the entire human brain will exist due to these hyperaccurate brainscans, and the workings of the brain will be understood.
*Nanobots capable of entering the bloodstream to "feed" cells and extract waste will exist (though not necessarily be in wide use) by the end of this decade. They will make the normal mode of human food consumption obsolete.
*By the late 2020s, nanotech-based manufacturing will be in widespread use, radically altering the economy as all sorts of products can suddenly be produced for a fraction of their traditional-manufacture costs. The true cost of any product is now the amount it takes to download the design schematics.
*By the later part of this decade, virtual reality will be so high-quality that it will be indistinguishable from real reality.
*The threat posed by genetically engineered [[pathogens]] permanently dissipates by the end of this decade as medical nanobots—infinitely more durable, intelligent and capable than any microorganism—become sufficiently advanced.
*The many variations of "Human Body 2.0" (as Kurzweil calls it) are incrementally accumulated into this and the following decade, with each organ and body system having its own course of refinement and development. It ultimately consists of a nanotechnological system of nourishment and circulation, obsolescing many internal organs, brain-extension and an improved skeleton.

====2023====
*10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; calculations per second—roughly the equivalent of one human brain—will cost $1,000.

====2025====
*The most likely year for the debut of advanced nanotechnology.
*Some military [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s and land vehicles will be 100% computer-controlled.

====2030s====
*[[Mind uploading]] becomes successful and perfected by the end of this decade as humans become software-based: living out on the Web, projecting bodies whenever they want or need (whether in virtual or real reality), and living indefinitely so long as they maintain their "mind file". Eventually, all human beings (including those with [[transbiological]] 2.0 or 3.0 bodies) will migrate to this [[postbiological]] state except for those who wish to remain unenhanced: the transbiological era giving way to the postbiological era.
*Nanomachines could be directly inserted into the brain and could interact with brain cells to totally control incoming and outgoing signals. As a result, truly full-immersion virtual reality could be generated without the need for any external equipment. [[Afferent nerve fiber|Afferent nerve]] pathways could be blocked, totally cancelling out the "real" world and leaving the user with only the desired virtual experience.
*Brain nanobots could also elicit emotional responses from users.
*Using brain nanobots, recorded or real-time brain transmissions of a person's daily life known as "experience beamers" will be available for other people to remotely experience. This is very similar to how the characters in ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'' were able to enter the mind of Malkovich and see the world through his eyes.
*Recreational uses aside, nanomachines in peoples' brains will allow them to greatly expand their cognitive, memory and sensory capabilities, to directly interface with computers, and to "telepathically" communicate with other, similarly augmented humans via wireless networks.
*The same nanotechnology should also allow people to alter the neural connections within their brains, changing the underlying basis for the person's intelligence, memories and personality.
*The many variations of "Human Body 3.0" are gradually implemented during this and the following decade; It most likely lacks a fixed, corporeal form and can alter its shape and external appearance at will via foglet-like nanotechnology.

====2040s====
*People spend most of their time in full-immersion virtual reality (Kurzweil has cited ''[[The Matrix]]'' as a good example of what the advanced virtual worlds will be like, without the dystopian twist).
*[[Utility fog|Foglet]]s are in use.
*Nonbiological intelligence will be billions of times more capable than biological intelligence.

====2045: The Singularity====
*$1000 buys a computer a billion times more intelligent than every human combined. This means that average and even low-end computers are vastly smarter than even highly intelligent, unenhanced humans.
*The [[technological singularity]] occurs as artificial intelligences surpass human beings as the smartest and most capable life forms on the Earth. Technological development is taken over by the machines, who can think, act and communicate so quickly that normal humans cannot even comprehend what is going on. The machines enter into a "runaway reaction" of self-improvement cycles, with each new generation of A.I.s appearing faster and faster. From this point onwards, technological advancement is explosive, under the control of the machines, and thus cannot be accurately predicted (hence the term "Singularity").
*The Singularity is an extremely disruptive, world-altering event that forever changes the course of human history. The extermination of humanity by violent machines is unlikely (though not impossible) because sharp distinctions between man and machine will no longer exist thanks to the existence of cybernetically enhanced humans and uploaded humans.

====Post-2045: "Waking up" the Universe====
*The physical bottom limit to how small computer transistors (or other equivalent, albeit more effective components, such as [[memristors]] integrated into [[Crossbar latch]]es) can be shrunk is reached. From this moment onwards, computers can only be made more powerful if they are made larger in size.
*Because of this, A.I.s convert more and more of the Earth's matter into engineered, computational substrate capable of supporting more A.I.s. until the whole Earth is one, gigantic computer, except for a few [[nature reserves]] set aside on the planetary surface for those humans who decided to remain in their natural state. "MOSH's" (Mostly Original Substrate Human) who choose to remain purely organic would still possess virtual assistants that will act as their transcendent servants, living in the blurred real world ("foglet-reality") and being provided with environments and everything they could possibly need as they live out the rest of their normal lives unless they enhance themselves.
*At this point, the only possible way to increase the intelligence of the machines any farther is to begin converting all of the matter and energy in the universe into similar massive computers. A.I.s radiate outward from Earth, first into the [[Solar System]] and then out into [[interstellar space]], then galaxies in all directions, utilizing [[starship]]s that are [[Von Neumann probes]] with nanobot crews, breaking down whole planets, stars, moons, and meteoroids and reassembling them into computers. This, in effect, "wakes up" the universe as all the inanimate "dumb" matter (rocks, dust, gases, etc.) is converted into structured matter capable of supporting life (albeit synthetic life).
*Kurzweil predicts that machines might have the ability to make [[Jupiter Brain|planet-sized computers]] by 2099, which underscores how enormously technology will advance after the Singularity.
*The process of "waking up" the universe could be completed well before the end of the 22nd century, provided humans are not limited by the speed of light.
*With the entire universe made into a giant, highly efficient supercomputer, AI and human hybrids (so integrated that, in truth it is a new category of "life") would have both supreme intelligence and physical control over the universe. It is unknown what events will happen in a post cosmic computer mind era, but whatever it is, it will truly be incomprehensible in every sense of the word to feeble human minds. Perhaps an infinite unification of infinite saturated universes, multiverses, and omniverses, an endless vast collection of united cosmic computers possibly.
====Some indeterminate points within a few decades from now====
*Space technology becomes advanced enough to provide the Earth permanent protection from the threat of asteroid impacts.
*The antitechnology [[Luddite]] movement will grow increasingly vocal and possibly resort to violence as these people become enraged over the emergence of new technologies that threaten traditional attitudes regarding the nature of human life (radical life extension, genetic engineering, cybernetics) and the supremacy of mankind (artificial intelligence). Though the Luddites might, at best, succeed in delaying the Singularity, the march of technology is irresistible and they will inevitably fail in keeping the world frozen at a fixed level of development.
*The emergence of distributed energy grids and full-immersion virtual reality will, when combined with high bandwidth Internet, enable the ultimate in [[telecommuting]]. This, in turn, will make cities obsolete since workers will no longer need to be located near their workplaces. The decentralization of the population will make societies less vulnerable to terrorist and military attacks.

Kurzweil said in a 2006 C-SPAN2 interview that "nanotechnology-based" flying cars would be available in 20 years.&lt;ref name=booktv&gt;{{cite video |url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?194500-1/depth-ray-kurzweil |title=In Depth with Ray Kurzweil |publisher=[[Book TV]] |date=November 5, 2006 |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurzweil has said that by 2014, humanity will reach a "tipping point" where the cost-per-watt from solar energy is cheaper than from coal and oil: By capturing only 0.03 percent of the sun's energy that falls on Earth, humanity could meet virtually all of its projected energy needs up to 2030&lt;ref&gt;Human 2.0. By: Kurzweil, Ray, New Scientist, 02624079, September 24, 2005, Vol. 187, Issue 2518&lt;/ref&gt; (thirty trillion watts); this will be capable through with extremely inexpensive, lightweight, and efficient nano-engineered solar panels together with nano-fuel cells to store and distribute the captured energy. Kurzweil believes, by the end of the 2020s, humans will be able to completely replace fossil fuels.

Kurzweil has said that by the 2030s, people will be able to send nano-bots into their brains through their capillaries. The nano-bots will take up positions in close physical proximity to each interneuronal connection coming from each physical sense and cause the firing of neurons to result in full-immersion virtual reality, similar to the way psychedelic drugs alter consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/04/12/virtual-reality-will-come-from-inside-our-brain-not-goggles-says-ray-kurzweil/|title=Virtual reality via nanobot injection?

Kurzweil said the following in a November 2007 ''Computerworld'' interview:

*By the same year, practical virtual reality glasses will be in use. The devices will work by beaming images directly onto the retinas of their users, creating large, three-dimensional floating images in the person's field of view. Such devices would provide a visual experience on par with a very large television, but would be highly portable, combining the best features of a [[Portable media player|portable video player]] and a widescreen TV. The glasses will deliver full-immersion virtual reality.&lt;ref name=thegrill/&gt;
*By 2017, "augmented reality" will exist: The V.R. glasses previously mentioned will have advanced computers and sensors built into them that will be able to recognize elements within the user's environment and then provide appropriate information and assistance through visual or auditory means. If the user looks at a building or a person's face, the computer will provide information through a "heads-up-display" beamed onto the person's retinas. The devices could also be used for keeping track of schedules, navigating, and querying for general information.&lt;ref name=thegrill/&gt;
* "By 2019, we will largely overcome the major diseases that kill 95 percent of us in the developed world, and we will be dramatically slowing and reversing the dozen or so processes that underlie aging."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Derek|title=Ray Kurzweil's Future|url=http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2006/08/09/ray_kurzweils_future|website=In The Pipeline|publisher=Science|accessdate=November 21, 2015|authorlink=Derek Lowe (chemist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*By 2022, medical technology will be more than a thousand times more advanced than it is today, and the "tipping point" of human life expectancy will have been reached, with every new year of research guaranteeing at least one more year of life expectancy. Kurzweil also states that 3–4 months of life expectancy were added in 2007 due to the development of new medicines and treatments.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;
*Cell phones and PCs will be increasingly woven into a global grid of computers wirelessly connected to the Internet. Instead of each device just sending and receiving its own data, more and more of the machines will be tasked with processing foreign data, creating a huge, interconnected network with millions of nodes.
*By 2027, accurate computer simulations of all parts of the human brain will exist.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

==Criticism==
In the cover article of the December 2010 issue of ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'', [[John Rennie (editor)|John Rennie]] criticized Kurzweil's predictions: "On close examination, his clearest and most successful predictions often lack originality or profundity. And most of his predictions come with so many loopholes that they border on the unfalsifiable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Rennie |author-link=John Rennie (editor) |title=Ray Kurzweil's slippery futurism |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/ray-kurzweils-slippery-futurism |journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |date = December 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3705">The '''Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001''' (asp 14) is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]]. It was passed on 4 October 2001, receiving [[Royal Assent]] on 6 November.&lt;ref name="statutelaw introduction" /&gt;

==Background and legislation==
In January 2000, following the [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution of the Scottish Parliament]] the previous year, [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice|Justice Minister]] [[Jim Wallace, Baron Wallace of Tankerness|Jim Wallace]] announced proposals to reform [[Scots family law|family law in Scotland]], which would include new legislation on [[domestic abuse]].&lt;ref name=BBCJan00 /&gt; Plans to increase protection for victims of domestic violence were temporarily delayed&lt;ref name=BBCSep00 /&gt; but the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] was published in June 2001 and was subsequently passed by the parliament on 4 October.&lt;ref name=BBCOct01 /&gt; The act received Royal Assent on 6 November.&lt;ref name="statutelaw introduction" /&gt;

The act allows [[interdict]]s to be brought against abusers by their victims and gives the police the power to arrest and charge an individual who breaks such an interdict.&lt;ref name="statutelaw introduction" /&gt; By giving the police this new power, the act amends the [[Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981]].&lt;ref name="statutelaw amendment" /&gt; The 2001 act was intended to extend protection to victims of domestic abuse by unmarried and same-sex partners, as well as those no longer in a relationship with their abuser.&lt;ref name=evaluation /&gt;

The '''psychotherapy and social action model''' is an approach to [[psychotherapy]] characterized by concentration on past and present personal, social, and political obstacles to [[mental health]]. In particular, the goal of this therapeutic approach is to acknowledge that individual symptoms are not unique, but rather shared by people similarly oppressed and marginalized. Ultimately, the psychotherapy and social action model aims to aid clients in overcoming [[mental illness]] through personal psychotherapy, group [[Coping (psychology)|coping]], and collective social action.

==Background==
	The psychotherapy and social action model was initially proposed by Sue Holland, a [[psychotherapist]] with a background in community action. Holland developed this framework in 1980 following her experience working with women coping with psychological disorders at a housing estate in West London.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher &amp; P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; At this estate, Holland observed the psychological difficulties experienced by women, noticing that their mental health was fundamentally tied to the social and economic obstacles they encountered as females in their society. In addition, Holland took issue with the way [[Depression (mood)]] was being treated at the shelter, believing that individualized treatment, especially with the use of psychotropic medication, was not successfully addressing the root of the dysfunction for these women. Instead, Holland posited a pathway from individual treatment to sociopolitical action that empowered women to deal with their mental dysfunction both privately and socially. As such, the psychotherapy and social action model is rooted in the ideals of both traditional psychotherapy and [[Feminism|feminist]] empowerment.

	Implementation of the model began with a three-year trial run and, according to Holland (1992), achieved its three initial goals, including providing private focused psychotherapy, promoting mental health, and fostering community continuity. There was initial evidence supporting the efficacy of the model in treating individual psychological dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher &amp; P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Model==

The square model derives from the sociological theory of the four paradigms for the analysis of social theory.&lt;ref&gt;Burrell, G. &amp; Morgan, G. (1979). Sociological Paradigms and Organisational Analysis. London: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the frame of the model, the dichotomy of individual versus social approaches to personal well-being is represented. The two bottom cells of the square delineate the changing of individuals to conform to social convention while the two top cells of the square represent the changing of social structures as opposed to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Orford, J. (2008). Community Psychology: challenges, controversies and emerging consensus (Illustrated ed.). London: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

The four cells within the frame represent the four paradigms of social theory including functionalist, interpretive, radical humanist, and radical structuralist paradigms. [[Functional psychology|Functionalism]] here is rooted in regulation and objective thinking, and represents the individual, status-quo approach to mental health. The interpretive paradigm is characterized by an approach to understanding the social world through subjective experience, and represents psychoeducation within the psychotherapy framework. The radical humanist paradigm is defined by a radial approach to change with an emphasis on “transcending limitations of existing social arrangements.” (Burrell &amp; Morgan, 1979, p.&amp;nbsp;32). With respect to an approach to therapy, this stage is characterized by the adoption of a social self, such that healing occurs at a group or collective level. The radical structuralist paradigm concentrates on radical change through political or economic emancipation. This is the endpoint of therapy, at which time the client is empowered to challenge sociopolitical structures that foster the conditions perpetuating the manifestation of individual mental illness within an oppressed group.

Taken from her 1992 publication entitled, “From Social Abuse to Social Action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women,” Holland formulated her four step approach to mental health and social action for women in treatment for depression as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher &amp; P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

===I. Patient on Pills===
At this stage, patients endorse the status-quo characterization of the “individualized patient.” As such, they treat their disorder passively with psychotropic medication and accept the label associated with their illness.

===II. Person-to-Person Psychotherapy===
This stage represents the first alternative to the status-quo treatment of psychiatric disorders: [[talk therapy]]. At this stage, clients and therapists are able to explore the meaning of their psychopathology and pinpoint the potential causes through individual therapy.

===III. Talking in Groups===
At this stage, the client is able to move past the personal challenges that are acknowledged and addressed in psychotherapy and discover that the challenges are universal amongst similarly marginalized individuals. Together, clients aim to acknowledge what is best for the collective.

===IV. Taking Action===
The final stage, as the name suggests, is the point at which the collective mobilizes to change the social structures enabling their common oppression. Having changed from an individual to a collective, the clients should feel empowered to undertake social change.

Included in this framework is the assumption that only some of the clients in this therapy will traverse all three stages. In Holland’s words, “…many will be content enough with the relief from symptoms and the freedom to get on with their personal lives which the individual therapy gives them.” (Holland, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;73). Thus, this framework is fluid based on the personal inclinations of the client throughout the therapeutic process.

The '''Red Power movement''' was a social movement led by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] youth to demand self-determination for Native Americans in the United States. Organizations that were part of Red Power Movement included [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) and [[National Indian Youth Council]] (NIYC).&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/246350552|title=Red power : the Native Americans' fight for freedom|last=M.|first=Josephy, Alvin|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Univ. of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803276117|oclc=246350552}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement sought the rights for Native Americans to make policies and programs for themselves while maintaining and controlling their own land and resources.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The Red Power movement took a confrontational and civil disobedience approach to inciting change in United States to Native American affairs&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/909325616|title=Like a hurricane : the Native American movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee|last=Allen|first=Warrior, Robert|date=1996-01-01|publisher=New Press|isbn=9781565844025|oclc=909325616}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to using negotiations and settlements, which national Native American groups such as [[National Congress of American Indians]] had before.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Red Power centered around mass action, militant action, and unified action.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://redpowermedia.wordpress.com/2014/01/03/from-the-red-power-movement-to-idle-no-more/|title=From the Red Power Movement to Idle No More|last=Media|first=Red Power|last2=Staff|date=2014-01-03|website=RED POWER MEDIA|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "'''Red Power'''", attributed to the author [[Vine Deloria, Jr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Vine Deloria Jr.|date=2018-06-29|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vine_Deloria_Jr.&amp;oldid=848033644|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly expressed a growing sense of pan-Indian identity in the late 1960s among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Events that were part of the movement include the [[Occupation of Alcatraz]], the [[Trail of Broken Treaties]], the [[Wounded Knee incident|Occupation of Wounded Knee]], along with intermittent protests and occupations throughout the era.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cr.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/alca/indian.html&lt;/ref&gt; The lasting impression of the Red Power movement was the resurrection of American Indian pride, action, and awareness.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Many bills and laws were also enacted in favor of American Indians in response to the Red Power movement, one of the most important being the reversal of tribe recognition termination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Background ==
From 1953 to 1964, the United States government terminated recognition of more than 100 tribes and bands as sovereign dependent nations with the [[House concurrent resolution 108|House Concurrent Resolution 108]]. This resolution stated that the tribes would be under US law and treated as American citizens instead of having the status as wards of the US.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0614.html|title=INDIAN AFFAIRS: LAWS AND TREATIES. Vol. 6, Laws|last=Library|first=Oklahoma State University|website=digital.library.okstate.edu|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affected tribes were no longer protected by the government and stripped of their right to govern their own people.

[[Indian Relocation Act of 1956|The Relocation Act of 1956]] resulted in as many as 750,000 American Indians migrating to cities during the period from 1950-1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/indiancountry/history/relocate.html|title=Indian Country Diaries . History . 1950s Relocation Program {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act was implemented to encourage and provide support for American Indians to find jobs in cities and improve their lives from the poverty-ridden reservations. The government offered vocational training, housing, and financial support for those who chose to relocate. These promised amenities were often not provided or inadequately provided, resulting in American Indians distanced from their cultural lands and economically worse off than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walls|first=Melissa L.|last2=Whitbeck|first2=Les B.|title=The Intergenerational Effects of Relocation Policies on Indigenous Families|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0192513X12447178|journal=Journal of Family Issues|language=en|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1272–1293|doi=10.1177/0192513x12447178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Relocation and Termination era described above fueled the resistance of American Indians. The oldest recognized National American Indian group was [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI), established in 1944.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/163306494|title=Dictionary of American history / 10 Contributors, Learning Guide, and Index.|last=I.|first=Kutler, Stanley|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Scribner's Sons|isbn=0684805332|oclc=163306494}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCAI set a precedent by successfully being the first multi-tribal political organization run entirely by Indians. NCAI fought against voting discrimination, against the termination of [[Government-to-government|government to government]] relationship between the US and native tribes, and against US interference in tribal counsels. They aimed to close gaps between Indians who lived on reservations and those who had relocated to cities, elderly and Indian Youth, and different tribes from one another.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; NCAI was the main political organization that preceded the Red Power Movement.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

== Main organizations involved ==

=== [[American Indian Movement]] ===

At the forefront of the Red Power Movement was American Indian Movement(AIM), which was founded in 1968 in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].  Its members belonged to and represented mainly urban Indian communities, and its leaders were young and militant.  Like the [[Black Panthers]] and [[Brown Berets]], AIM was initially organized to work for Indian civil rights in cities.  Its members monitored law enforcement practices, and worked to highlight and prevent police harassment and brutality.  AIM soon played a major role in building a network of [[urban Indian]] centers, churches and [[philanthropic organization]]s.  It helped establish the "[[powwow circuit]]," which publicized news of protest activities across the country.  Skillful in attracting attention from the news media, AIM inspired local chapters and writing about American Indian political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aimovement.org/ggc/history.html|title=A Brief Histry of AIM|website=www.aimovement.org|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[National Indian Youth Council]] ===

The National Indian Youth Council(NIYC) was founded in 1961 by young American Indians who were college students or recent college graduates.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/national-indian-youth-council|title=National Indian Youth Council - Dictionary definition of National Indian Youth Council {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were one of the first militant Indian rights organizations following the conservative ways of the NCAI. NIYC were strong opponents of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and got involved in many of the events in the Red Power Movement.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Like AIM, the council believed in and fought for the recognition of tribes federally and reinstating tribal governance.

=== [[Women of All Red Nations]] ===

Women of All Red Nations (WARN) emerged in 1974 from the main founders, [[Lorelei DeCora Means]], [[Madonna Thunder Hawk|Madonna Thunderhawk]], [[Phyllis Young]], [[Janet McCloud]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DreCFo6MrR8C&amp;pg=PA51&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Red Power: The American Indians' Fight for Freedom|last=Josephy|first=Alvin M.|last2=Nagel|first2=Joane|last3=Johnson|first3=Troy R.|date=1999|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803225873|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; WARN acted as a branch from AIM that focused on American Indian women's and family rights. Main issues that WARN fought against were the forced sterilization of Native women and the lack of adequate health services on the reservations.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://equalityarchive.com/issues/women-of-all-red-nations/|title=Women of All Red Nations {{!}} Equality Archive|date=2015-11-03|work=Equality Archive|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; WARN took action by becoming involved in Indian custody battles, protesting mining companies who were poisoning food and water sources, and collecting data on Indian women who had been sterilized without consent.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== [[International Indian Treaty Council]] ===

The International Indian Treaty Council (IITC) was founded in 1974 in Standing Rock, South Dakota. More than 98 Indigenous tribes were represented by over 5000 people at this first gathering. IITC grew into a voice for Indians internationally—covering North, Central, and South America, the Caribbean, and the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iitc.org/about-iitc/|title=About IITC / Acerca de CITI - iitc.org|website=www.iitc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; IITC focuses on the pursuit of sovereignty and self-determination for indigenous peoples through activism, training, and unified gatherings. As the first indigenous organization to be granted Consultive Status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 1977, IITC was able to represent the concerns and fight for the acknowledgement of indigenous rights to the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aimovement.org/iitc/|title=International Indian Treaty Council &amp; AIM Speakers Bureau|website=www.aimovement.org|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
From 1969 to the [[Longest Walk of 1978]], the Red Power Movement highlighted issues through social protest.  Its goals were for the federal government to honor treaty obligations and provide financial "resources, education, housing and healthcare to alleviate poverty."&lt;ref name="Alcatraz Is Not an Island"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/itvs/alcatrazisnotanisland/activism.html "Alcatraz Is Not an Island"], ''Indian Activism'', pbs.org, accessed 10 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The RPM wanted to gain Indian participation in social institutions; it was instrumental in supporting the founding of Indian colleges, as well as the creation of [[Indian studies]] programs at existing institutions, and the establishment of museums and cultural centers to celebrate Indian contributions.

The 1960s marked the beginning of a "[[Native American Renaissance]]" in literature.  New books such as [[Vine Deloria, Jr.]]'s ''[[Custer Died for Your Sins]]'' (1969) and the classic ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]'' (1961), reprinted from the 1930s, reached millions of readers inside and outside Indian communities.  A wide variety of [[Native American writers|Indian writers]], [[Native American historians|historian]]s, and [[essayists]] gained publication following these successes and new authors were widely read.  [[N. Scott Momaday]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for one of his novels and [[Leslie Silko]] received acclaim.  Fiction and nonfiction works about Indian life and lore have continued to attract a large audience. Authors such as [[Louise Erdrich]] and [[Michael Dorris]] have earned continued recognition.  Since the late twentieth century, novels by [[Sherman Alexie]] have been adapted for film as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/223155553|title=Native American renaissance|last=Kenneth.|first=Lincoln,|date=1992-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520054578|oclc=223155553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occupation of Alcatraz  ===
The [[Occupation of Alcatraz]] began on November 20, 1969 when more than 80 young, mostly college aged American Indians, who identified themselves as [[United Indians of All Tribes|Indians of All Tribes (IAT)]]&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; boarded boats to approach and occupy [[Alcatraz Island]] overnight. The young American Indians settled with the legal backing of a [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Sioux Treaty]] that named any federal "out of use" land available for Indians. The US federal government had closed the Alcatraz federal prison and the island was no longer in use as of 1962. This treaty was used to send the message that treaties are still relevant and should be honored.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;  
[[File:Alcatraz Occupation "Welcome to Indian Land" graffiti.jpeg|thumb|352x352px|Sign in Alcatraz (1969)]]
The occupation had been planned ahead of time by [[Adam Nordwall]], a successful Indian businessman, and [[Richard Oakes (activist)|Richard Oakes]], a [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State]] student. The two agreed to and told sympathetic media outlets about their plan to take over Alcatraz at a dinner party hosted by ''San Francisco Chronicle'' reporter Tim Findley. They threatened that if there were any leaks of the story early, the plan to occupy Alcatraz would be called off.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Their first attempt, on November 9, 1969—the date the media had been told—resulted in circling the island in a boat with media coverage from all over the Bay Area. Although they did not begin the occupation that night, Oakes jumped off of the circling boat as others followed and swam to Alcatraz. After making it to Alcatraz, the young Indians were removed by Coast Guard that night but would be back in much larger numbers on November 20.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;{{Quote box

1. It is isolated from modern facilities, and without adequate means of transportation.

2. It has no fresh running water.

3. The sanitation facilities are inadequate.

4. There are no oil or mineral rights.

5. There is no industry and so unemployment is very great.

6. There are no health care facilities.

7. The soil is rocky and non-productive and the land does not support game.

8. There are no educational facilities.

9. The population has always been held as prisoners and kept dependent upon others.

}}During the occupation, IAT released a statement called the [[Alcatraz Proclamation]] which explained that the Indians had the right to Alcatraz Island due to the right to discovery. The Proclamation continued onto describing the deserted prison island as comparable to the conditions of the Indian Reservations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=ALCATRAZ_Proclamation|title=ALCATRAZ Proclamation - FoundSF|website=www.foundsf.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; IAT was also joined by National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) during the Alcatraz movement and the growing group of young, educated, and passionate American Indians made their presence known in the media.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Richard Oakes became the public figure for the occupation and participated in the press conferences for releases of documents such as the Alcatraz Proclamation and goals for the island which included building cultural centers, educational facilities, and recreational spaces for Indians to be together as Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Intelligent Channel|title=Richard Oakes delivering the Alcatraz Proclamation (1969) - from THE EDUCATION ARCHIVE|date=2013-03-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QNfUE7hBUc|accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Occupation of Alcatraz ended after a series of disorienting events on the island. The January 1970 death of Richard Oakes' 13-year-old stepdaughter due to falling from a building brought Richard and his wife Anne back to the mainland.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Some of the student occupiers went back to school when the Oakes' left. A problem of drug and alcohol abuse also became prominent on the island, which affected the occupations reputation.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; The remaining leaders were John Trudell, LaNada Means, and Stella Leach, who could not end up agreeing on a way to further develop the occupation. Electricity and water being cut off to the island by May, and a suspicious fire that burned three buildings were further factors that led to the dismantling of the occupation.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; Protestors continued to depart from the island during the downward spiral. On June 11, 1971 a large amount of police officers used force to remove the remaining few protestors.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

Although the protesters ultimately failed to achieve their specific goals, they helped catalyze  the Indian community.  With the occupation of Alcatraz, a participant said, "we got back our worth, our pride, our dignity, our humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2096434 |title=American Indian Ethnic Renewal: Politics and the Resurgence of Identity |first=Joane |last=Nagel |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |volume=60 |number=6 |date=Dec 1995 |pages=947–965 |registration=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occupation of D-Q University ===
With young, college aged students at the center of many Red Power movement protests, the pursuit of higher education, particularly for American Indians became a main initiative. In 1970, while the Alcatraz occupation was still occurring, a group of Indian youth took over US military surplus land near Davis, California. These youth had applied for the land but were denied access after [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] was granted access, regardless of UC Davis' legally incomplete application. In retaliation, the youth hopped the fences onto the property leading to the establishment and occupation of [[D–Q University|D-Q University]].&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AuOXYesYSn0C&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=DQ+university#v=onepage&amp;q=DQ%20university&amp;f=false|title=American Indian Activism: Alcatraz to the Longest Walk|last=Johnson|first=Troy R.|last2=Nagel|first2=Joane|last3=Champagne|first3=Duane|date=1997-01-01|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252066535|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; D-Q University became the first tribal university that was established in California, and the first that was not affiliated with a single reservation. A deed was granted to the student occupation in April 1971.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Since then, D-Q University became part of the [[Tribal colleges and universities|Tribal Colleges and Universities]] and received accreditation in 1977. The curriculum of D-Q University included cultural and traditional focused education in order to educate Indians about Indians.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; The university struggled to keep enrollment rates up and secure funding, which resulted in the ultimate loss of accreditation in 2005. However, the occupation that created D-Q University highlighted the importance of higher education for American Indians to the Red Power Movement.

=== Trail of Broken Treaties ===
[[File:Seal of the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs.svg|thumb|BIA seal]]
In August 1972, the Red Power movement continued under the direction of American Indian Movement(AIM) with the [[Trail of Broken Treaties|trail of broken treaties]]. The trail of broken treaties, a play on the "[[Trail of Tears]]," was the migration of seven caravans from areas across the west coast to the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.framingredpower.org/narrative/tbt/|title=Framing Red Power|last=Heppler|first=Jason A.|website=www.framingredpower.org|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BIA had become widely associated with corruption and not acting in the best interest of the American Indians.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://washingtonspark.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/native-americans-take-over-bureau-of-indian-affairs-1972/|title=Native Americans Take Over Bureau of Indian Affairs: 1972|date=2013-03-26|website=Washington Area Spark|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protestors started arriving in D.C. on November 1 with the intent of bringing a [[Twenty Points|list of twenty demands]] to the BIA.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Upon arrival, the activists and GSA security had a misunderstanding about the activists being housed in the BIA building. This resulted in the activists overpowering the security and taking over the building. The American Indians then barricaded the doors, with furniture from the BIA they had broken apart, and the occupation began on November 2, 1972.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This occupation of the BIA had started the week before the presidential election, making a D.C. occupation the center of media attention. Threats of police force were used daily against the Indians if they did not come out. Supporters from outside of the occupation would come to the BIA to create a human barricade keeping the police from entering the occupied building.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; On November 6, a judge had given an order for the occupiers to vacate the building before 6 pm that day or they would be forcibly evicted.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As the Indians braced for eviction, some exited the building to create a perimeter around it with clubs, spears and other weaponry to resist.  Others inside the building were rumored to have guns and explosives awaiting the invasion of GSA officials.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The spokesman of the occupation, [[Russell Means|Russel Means]], spoke on the front stairs of the BIA explaining that the occupation would end when their demands had been met, and no time sooner. The deadline for the Indians to leave was pushed back yet again to November 8. Before this date, Indian lawyers had discovered evidence that would essentially abolish the BIA with exposure of corruption and misuse of the program.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; On November 8, the protestors left the BIA building with paintings, artifacts, and $2 million worth of damage.

=== Wounded Knee ===
The [[Wounded Knee incident|Wounded Knee Incident]] started on February 27, 1973 and lasted 71 days. More than 200 Indians in support of the Oglala Sioux people of Pine Ridge Reservation took over the town of Wounded Knee, South Dakota. The Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO), a group of mostly full-Indian women that lived on Pine Ridge Reservation had been unsuccessful in a trial to impeach Dick Wilson, who was the chairman of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OEzAiB8U6EC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=Oglala+Sioux+Civil+Rights+Organization+(OSCRO)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rzJJ9pya80&amp;sig=T8lZELkugTlECAnYPEebKtE82EA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rOAJTsCJMsOssAKQnrSyAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Oglala%20Sioux%20Civil%20Rights%20Organization%20(OSCRO)&amp;f=false|title=Ruling Pine Ridge: Oglala Lakota Politics from the IRA to Wounded Knee|last=Reinhardt|first=Akim D.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|isbn=9780896726017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Wilson claimed he was too close to white people, too cozy with the government, and was disrespecting his Oglala Sioux culture.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/04/obituaries/richard-wilson-55-tribal-head-in-occupation-of-wounded-knee.html|title=Richard Wilson, 55, Tribal Head In Occupation of Wounded Knee|last=Foderaro|first=Lisa W.|date=1990-02-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-17|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enraged that Wilson had not been impeached, OSCRO continued to gather and brainstorm a response. They decided to ask AIM for help in reacting to what they felt was an injustice. With AIM in the picture, occupying Wounded Knee was their final decision.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Wounded Knee was chosen as a tribute to the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] of 1890, where hundreds of Lakota Indians were killed by the 7th US Cavalry Regiment in reported efforts to disarm the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.war.056|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains {{!}} WOUNDED KNEE MASSACRE|website=plainshumanities.unl.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a historical remembrance of the massacre, the town had visitor trade posts dedicated to the grave sites of the Indians that many Indians thought were disrespectful and used for commercial purposes.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; The owners of the trade posts would sell native Indian crafts for more than they had bought them and had a history of racism towards the local Indians. The occupiers attacked the trade posts first to accumulate the ammunitions and weaponry that were held there.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The occupation formed to deliver a message that American Indians would not sit around peacefully as treaties were broken, unfair trials were given, and their land was ceded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aics.org/WK/wk011.html|title=American Indian Movement Documents from MSU|last=Movement|first=Mike Wicks of American Indian|website=www.aics.org|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal agents gathered around Wounded Knee while the occupiers would host events for the media to cover in order to promote their message.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Throughout the occupation of Wounded Knee, the protestors and federal agents would often have shootouts at night. The Indians would be shooting from inside Wounded Knee and the federal agents from the outside perimeter they had formed.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/08/may-8-1973-standoff-at-wounded-knee-comes-to-an-end/comment-page-1/?_r=0|title=May 8, 1973 {{!}} Standoff at Wounded Knee Comes to an End|last=Network|first=The Learning|work=The Learning Network|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these shootouts, two Indians were killed and one federal agent was permanently paralyzed. The death of the second Indian, who was from the Pine Ridge Reservation and an Oglala Sioux, Buddy Lamont, led many Indians to seek an end to the violent occupation. On May 8, 1973 the American Indians surrendered to the surrounding federal agents after 10 weeks.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Russell Means, one of the more recognized leaders of the AIM, negotiated with U.S. forces to release the hostages on the premises that the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hold hearings on the Indian treaties that were broken by the U.S. government as well as investigations of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and its members' attention to the living conditions at Pine Ridge.

This event is not only significant because it was one of the first violent acts initiated first by the Natives, but it also led to generations of Indians getting involved in civil rights and tribal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landry|first1=Alysa|title=Wounded Knee is hailed as one of AIM's greatest successes|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/history/events/native-history-aim-occupation-of-wounded-knee-begins/|website=Indian Country Today|publisher=Indian Country Today Media Network|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nixon administration]] had earlier declared that it had wanted to end the "revolutionary Indian element", but because so many Natives took notice and began to make changes in the local governments controlling their reservations, the administration failed to end their protests and stopped trying to interfere.

Russell Means and [[Dennis Banks]], the two AIM leaders mostly in charge of Wounded Knee II, were arrested immediately after the hostages were released. However, on September 16, 1973, the charges were dropped and they were dismissed on the account that the U.S. government had unlawfully influenced witnesses and tampered with evidence. The violence of these types of protests then continued through the rest of the 1970s.

== Legacy ==
The Red Power movement had accomplished many of its goals by the time direct social activism declined in the late 1970s. "By the early 1980s, over 100 Indian studies programs had been created in the United States. Tribal museums opened."&lt;ref name="Alcatraz Is Not an Island" /&gt; Among the most prominent of the cultural centers is the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] (NMAI), which was sponsored by Hawaii's senator [[Daniel Inouye]] and authorized by the [[US Congress]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/alcatraz-occupation-four-decades-ago-led-to-many-benefits-for-american-indians/|title=Alcatraz Occupation Four Decades Ago Led to Many Benefits for American Indians - Indian Country Media Network|website=indiancountrymedianetwork.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NMAI opened on [[National Mall|the Mall]] in [[Washington, DC]] in 2004. It also has a branch at the former US Customs House, on the Bowling Green in [[Lower Manhattan]].

Many laws were passed in response to the Red Power movement, one of the most notable being the [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975|Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act]] of 1975, which reversed the termination of federal tribe recognition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This act restored the recognition and government to government status to tribes, giving them control to govern their own tribes and reservations with funding provided by the government if they followed certain guidelines. Since the termination of Indian tribe recognition was a major catalyst to start the movement,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; regaining recognition was considered a huge success for RPM.

=== Laws passed in favor of American Indians during the Red Power movement ===
The following laws were passed during the movement:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''[[Indian Education Act]] of 1972''' provided additional funds to school districts with high populations of Indian children
* '''[[Indian Health Service]] budget doubled''' from 1970 to 1975, which provided funding for Indian hospitals and clinics.
* '''[[Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission]] (NWIFC)''' was established in 1975, as a result of fish-in protests. The NWIFC consists of members from 20 tribes who are recognized as natural resources co-managers with the State of Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nwifc.org|title=Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission|website=Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''[[Indian Health Care Improvement Act]]''' of 1976 was passed by Congress to improve the health-care system for American Indians. This act includes scholarships for American Indians who are looking to pursue studies in medicine, dentistry, psychiatry, nursing and pharmacy. 
* '''[[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]]''' was passed in 1978 and terminated the outlaw of Indian religious practices such as sun dance, bear dance, and the use of sweat lodges.
* '''[[Branch of Acknowledgement and Research]] (BAR)''' was created by the BIA in 1978 to process applications from tribes for federal recognition. BAR was never federally approved, but still is in control of recognizing Indian tribes.
* '''[[Indian Child Welfare Act]]''' was passed by Congress in 1978. This act was in response to years of the BIA placing Indian children in boarding schools away from their reservations. It allows tribes to have some control over adoption and placement of Indian orphan children. 
* '''[[Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act]]'''  of 1978 authorized community colleges to exist on reservations

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">'''Reference Broadcast Time [[synchronization]]''' is a method in which the receiver uses the [[physical layer]] broadcasts for comparing the clocks. This is slightly different from traditional methods which synchronize the sender's with the receiver's clock.

RBS allows nodes to synchronize their clocks to the resolution necessary for example for wireless sensor network applications. Rather than broadcasting a time stamp in a synchronization packet as in protocols such as [[:pt:Ntp|NTP]], RBS allows the nodes receiving the synchronization packets to use the packet’s time of arrival as a reference point for clock synchronization. Because most of the non-deterministic propagation time involved in transmitting a packet over a wireless channel lies between construction of the packet and the sender’s transceiver (e.g., sender’s queue delay, MAC contention delay, etc.), RBS removes most delay uncertainty involved in typical time synchronization protocols. For single-hop networks, the RBS algorithm is very simple. First, a transmitter broadcasts some number M as reference broadcasts. Each receiver that receives these broadcasts exchanges the time that each reference broadcast was received locally with its neighbors. Nodes then calculate phase shifts relative to each other as the average of the difference of the time stamps of the node’s local clocks for the M reference broadcasts. In multihop networks, time synchronization can be performed hop by hop between two nodes as long as the nodes on each link along the path have a common node whose reference broadcasts they can synchronize to.&lt;ref&gt;J. Elson, L. Girod, and D. Estrin. "Fine-grained network time synchronization using reference broadcasts".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2556">The '''Reynolds–Sorgi Incident''' refers to an American [[college football]] in-game incident in which [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] linebacker [[Robert Reynolds (football player)|Robert Reynolds]] choked [[Wisconsin Badgers]] quarterback [[Jim Sorgi]], injuring Sorgi's [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], after the play had been whistled dead. Sorgi was unable to play for the remainder of the game, struggling to breathe and unable to speak.

==The game==
On October 11, 2003, the Buckeyes entered the game as the defending national champions, ranked #3 in the country and on a 19-game winning streak with a record of 5–0. The unranked Badgers came into the game at 5–1, having lost at home to UNLV. The Badgers were without star running back Anthony Davis, who was recovering from a fractured eye-socket caused by a late-hit. The game was played at the Badgers' home [[Camp Randall Stadium]].

Midway through the third quarter, Sorgi scrambled for an eight-yard gain before being brought down by a convergence of OSU tacklers. After the play was called dead, Reynolds grabbed Sorgi's throat with his hand as Sorgi lay on his back. Sorgi's vocal cords were bruised, he had a hard time breathing, and he was unable to speak. He would not return to the game, and though Reynolds was not whistled for a foul, the Badgers came back to win the game.

After the game, [[Big Ten]] commissioner [[James Delany]] commented, "(Reynolds' actions) have no place in our game." Buckeyes coach [[Jim Tressel]] initially claimed he didn't see the play but later said "Robert's conduct was totally unacceptable and has no place in intercollegiate athletics." Ohio State suspended Reynolds for one game and Reynolds issued a public apology.

Years later, on October 28, 2011, Robert Reynolds came forward to make another public apology, stating that he wanted to put the incident behind him and teach his four children about being accountable and moving on from their mistakes. Reynolds also said that he and Sorgi had made amends not long after the incident occurred, something for which Reynolds said he was very grateful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6970">{{Utilitarianism}}
'''Rule utilitarianism''' is a form of [[utilitarianism]] that says an action is right as it conforms to a rule that leads to the greatest good, or that "the rightness or wrongness of a particular action is a function of the correctness of the rule of which it is an instance".&lt;ref name="Garner and Rosen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garner |first=Richard T. |author2=Bernard Rosen  |title=Moral Philosophy: A Systematic Introduction to Normative Ethics and Meta-ethics |year=1967 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |location=New York |isbn=0-02-340580-5 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers [[Richard Brandt]] and [[Brad Hooker]] are major proponents of such approach.

For rule utilitarians, the correctness of a rule is determined by the amount of good it brings about when followed. In contrast, [[Act utilitarianism|act utilitarians]] judge an act in terms of the consequences of that act alone (such as stopping at a red light), rather than judging whether it faithfully adhered to the rule of which it was an instance (such as, "always stop at red lights"). Rule utilitarians argue that following rules that tend to lead to the greatest good will have better consequences overall than allowing exceptions to be made in individual instances, even if better consequences can be demonstrated in those instances.

==Mill's formulation==
In his 1863 book ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]'', [[John Stuart Mill]] defends the concept of [[rights]] in terms of utility: "To have a right, then, is, I conceive, to have something which society ought to defend me in the possession of. If the objector goes on to ask, why it ought? I can give him no other reason than general utility."&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |authorlink=John Stuart Mill |title=[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]] |year=1861 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Mill was a rule utilitarian is a matter of controversy.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism-rule/ |title=Rule Consequentialism |accessdate=2007-03-11 |date=2003-12-31 |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage from '' Utilitarianism'' seems to suggest that he was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the case of abstinences indeed—of things which people forbear to do from moral considerations, though the consequences in the particular case might be beneficial—it would be unworthy of an intelligent agent not to be consciously aware that the action is of a class which, if practiced generally, would be generally injurious, and that this is the ground of the obligation to abstain from it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But Mill also argues that it is sometimes right to violate general ethical rules:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... justice is a name for certain moral requirements, which, regarded collectively, stand higher in the scale of social utility, and are therefore of more paramount obligation, than any others; though particular cases may occur in which some other social duty is so important, as to overrule any one of the general maxims of justice. Thus, to save a life, it may not only be allowable, but a duty, to steal, or take by force, the necessary food or medicine, or to kidnap, and compel to officiate, the only qualified medical practitioner.&lt;ref name="Mill" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other  things being equal people are happier if their society follows rules so people know what types of behaviour they can expect from others in given situations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  Therefore, utilitarians can justify a system that goes, "Keep to the rules unless there is a strong reason for breaking them."

==Strong rule utilitarianism==

'''Strong rule utilitarianism''' ('''SRU''') gives a utilitarian account for the claim that moral rules should be obeyed at all places and times. SRU does not deteriorate into [[act utilitarianism]] like weak rule utilitarianism, but it shares weaknesses with similarly [[Moral absolutism|absolutist moral stances]] (notably, [[deontology|deontological]] ones). A scenario (or [[thought experiment]]) used to clarify this problem (often attributed to [[Kantian ethics#Lying|Immanuel Kant]]) posits both

# you know the location of some persons
# a murderer asks you about their location in order to go and kill them.

The moral convention is that lying is wrong, so the strong rule utilitarian says you should reveal their location. A more sophisticated SRU response is that

# the above scenario is very improbable.
# in the majority of situations, telling the truth leads to more trust and happiness.
# if applied universally (à la [[Kant]]'s [[categorical imperative]]), the rule against lying would create net utility.

Nevertheless, many disagree, claiming that (in this situation) telling the truth would result in needless death, would therefore be immoral, and that this scenario thus provides a [[counterexample]] contradicting SRU.

==Weak rule utilitarianism==

'''Weak rule utilitarianism''' ('''WRU''') attempts to handle [[#Strong rule utilitarianism|SRU]] counterexamples as legitimate exceptions. One such response is [[two-level utilitarianism]]; more systematic WRUs attempt to create sub-rules to handle the exceptions. But as [[David Lyons (philosopher)|David Lyons]]&lt;ref&gt;''Forms and Limits of Utilitarianism'', 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; and others have argued, this will necessarily tend to collapse into [[act utilitarianism]]. Rules will require as many sub-rules as there are exceptions, thus many exceptions will make the more-sophisticated rule computationally intractable. [[Rational agents]] will then [[satisfice]] that intractability by seeking outcomes that produce the maximum utility.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Habib (2008), "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/promises/ Promises]", in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''smooth maximum''' of an [[indexed family]] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of numbers is a [[smooth approximation]] to the [[maximum]] function &lt;math&gt;\max(x_1,\ldots,x_n),&lt;/math&gt; meaning a [[parametric family]] of functions &lt;math&gt;m_\alpha(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that for every {{mvar|''α''}}, the function {{tmath|m_\alpha}} is smooth, and the family converges to the maximum function {{tmath|m_\alpha \to \max}} as {{tmath|\alpha\to\infty}}. The concept of '''smooth minimum''' is similarly defined. In many cases, a single family approximates both: maximum as the parameter goes to positive infinity, minimum as the parameter goes to negative infinity; in symbols, {{tmath|m_\alpha \to \max}} as {{tmath|\alpha \to \infty}} and {{tmath|m_\alpha \to \min}} as {{tmath|\alpha \to -\infty}}. The term can also be used loosely for a specific smooth function that behaves similarly to a maximum, without necessarily being part of a parametrized family.

== Examples ==
For large positive values of the parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the following formulation is one smooth, [[differential (calculus)|differentiable]] approximation of the maximum function.  For negative values of the parameter that are large in absolute value, it approximates the minimum.

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{S}_\alpha (x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i e^{\alpha x_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^n e^{\alpha x_i}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; has the following properties:
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_\alpha\to \max&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\alpha\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[arithmetic mean]] of its inputs
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_\alpha\to \min&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\alpha\to -\infty&lt;/math&gt;

The gradient of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is closely related to [[softmax function|softmax]] and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla_{x_i}\mathcal{S}_\alpha (x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \frac{e^{\alpha x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{\alpha x_j}} [1 + \alpha(x_i - \mathcal{S}_\alpha (x_1,\ldots,x_n))].
&lt;/math&gt;

This makes the softmax function useful for optimization techniques that use [[gradient descent]].

=== LogSumExp ===
{{main|LogSumExp}}
Another smooth maximum is [[LogSumExp]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{LSE}(x_1, \ldots,  x_n) = \log( \exp(x_1) + \ldots + \exp(x_n))
&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be normalized if the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are all non-negative, yielding a function with domain &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)^n&lt;/math&gt; and range &lt;math&gt;[0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
g(x_1, \ldots,  x_n) = \log( \exp(x_1) + \ldots + \exp(x_n) - (n - 1) )
&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt; term corrects for the fact that &lt;math&gt;\exp(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; by canceling out all but one zero exponential, and &lt;math&gt;\log 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; if all &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are zero.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2658">'''Suspicion''' is a [[cognition]] of mistrust in which a person doubts the honesty of another person or believes another person to be guilty of some type of wrongdoing or crime, but without sure proof. Suspicion can also be aroused in response to objects that negatively differ from an expected idea. In the US, the courts use the term "[[reasonable suspicion]]" in connection with the right of the police to stop people on the street. The word comes from Middle-English via the Old French word "suspicion", which is a variation of the Italian word "sospetto" (a derivative of the Latin term "suspectio", which means "to watch").

==History==
English philosopher, statesman, and author [[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626) wrote an essay entitled ''Of Suspicion'', in which he stated that suspicions need to be repressed and well-guarded, because otherwise they will cloud the mind, and cause a ruler to move towards tyranny, due to the fear that his subjects are conspiring against him, and a husband to become jealous and fearful of his wife's interactions with other men. Bacon argued that the root of suspicion was a lack of knowledge; as such, the remedy to suspicion was to learn more about the issue that is troubling you. If a husband is concerned about his wife's male friends, he should ask her about the nature of these friendships, and state his concerns, rather than building up his suspicions. Bacon urged people who were harbouring suspicions to be frank with the people that they were suspecting, and clear the matter up.&lt;ref&gt;http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/mike_donnelly/lotSEVEN.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The British dramatist [[William Shakespeare]] noted that "suspicion always haunts the guilty mind". English Renaissance dramatist, poet and actor [[Ben Jonson]] (1572–1637), a contemporary of Shakespeare, described suspicion as a "black poison" that "infects the human mind like a plague". [[Samuel Johnson]] (1709–1784), an English author and essayist,
called suspicion a "useless pain" in which a person has a belief that a formidable evil lies within all of their fellow men. The Scottish poet and a lyricist [[Robert Burns]] (1759–1796) called suspicion a "heavy armour" that impedes humans more than it protects them. [[Mahatma Gandhi]], the political and spiritual leader of the non-violent Indian independence movement, warned that if suspicions arise about any of a person's motives, then all of their acts can become tainted with this mistrust and uncertainty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8558">In [[model theory]], a discipline within the field of [[mathematical logic]], a '''tame abstract elementary class''' is an [[abstract elementary class]] (AEC) which satisfies a locality property for types called tameness. Even though it appears implicitly in earlier work of [[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]], tameness as a property of AEC was first isolated by [[Rami Grossberg|Grossberg]] and VanDieren,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|VanDieren|2006a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who observed that tame AECs were much easier to handle than general AECs.

== Definition ==

Let ''K'' be an [[abstract elementary class|AEC]] with joint embedding, amalgamation, and no maximal models. Just like in first-order model theory, this implies ''K'' has a universal model-homogeneous monster model &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Working inside &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;, we can define a semantic notion of [[type (model theory)|types]] by specifying that two elements ''a'' and ''b'' have the same type over some base model &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; if there is an [[automorphism]] of the monster model sending ''a'' to ''b'' fixing &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; pointwise (note that types can be defined in a similar manner without using a monster model&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shelah|2009}}, Definition II.1.9.&lt;/ref&gt;). Such types are called '''Galois types'''.

One can ask for such types to be determined by their restriction on a small domain. This gives rise to the notion of tameness:

* An AEC &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is ''tame'' if there exists a cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; such that any two distinct Galois types are already distinct on a submodel of their domain of size &lt;math&gt;\le \kappa&lt;/math&gt;. When we want to emphasize &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-tame.

Tame AECs are usually also assumed to satisfy amalgamation.

== Discussion and motivation ==

While (without the existence of [[large cardinal]]s) there are examples of non-tame AECs,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baldwin|Shelah|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; most of the known natural examples are tame.&lt;ref&gt;See the discussion in the introduction of {{harvnb|Grossberg|VanDieren|2006a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the following sufficient conditions for a class to be tame are known:

* '''Tameness is a large cardinal axiom''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boney|2014}}, Theorem 1.3.&lt;/ref&gt; There are class-many almost [[strongly compact cardinal]]s iff any abstract elementary class is tame.
* '''Some tameness follows from categoricity''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shelah|1999}}, Main claim 2.3 (9.2 in the online version).&lt;/ref&gt; If an AEC with amalgamation is categorical in a cardinal &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of high-enough cofinality, then tameness holds for types over saturated models of size less than &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Conjecture 1.5 in &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|VanDieren|2006b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;''':   If K is categorical in some λ ≥ Hanf(K) then there exists χ &lt; Hanf(K) such that K is χ-tame.

Many results in the model theory of (general) AECs assume weak forms of the [[Generalized continuum hypothesis]] and rely on sophisticated combinatorial set-theoretic arguments.&lt;ref&gt;See for example many of the hard theorems of Shelah's book ({{harvnb|Shelah|2009}}).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the model theory of tame AECs is much easier to develop, as evidenced by the results presented below.

== Results ==

The following are some important results about tame AECs.

* '''Upward categoricity transfer''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|VanDieren|2006b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-tame AEC with amalgamation that is categorical in some [[successor cardinal|successor]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda \ge \operatorname{LS}(K)^{++} + \kappa^+&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. has exactly one model of size &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; up to isomorphism) is categorical in ''all'' &lt;math&gt;\mu \ge \lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Upward stability transfer''':&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Baldwin|Kueker|VanDieren|2006}}, Theorem 4.5 for the first result and {{harvnb|Grossberg|VanDieren|2006a}} for the second.&lt;/ref&gt; A &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-tame AEC with amalgamation that is [[stable]] in a cardinal &lt;math&gt;\lambda \ge \kappa&lt;/math&gt; is stable in &lt;math&gt;\lambda^+&lt;/math&gt; and in every infinite &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mu^\lambda = \mu&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Tameness can be seen as a topological separation principle''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lieberman|2011}}, Proposition 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; An AEC with amalgamation is tame if and only if an appropriate [[Topological space|topology]] on the set of Galois types is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]].
* '''Tameness and categoricity imply there is a forking notion''':&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Vasey|2014}} for the first result, and {{harvnb|Boney|Vasey|2014}}, Corollary 6.10.5 for the result on dimension.&lt;/ref&gt; A &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-tame AEC with amalgamation that is categorical in a cardinal &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of [[cofinality]] greater than or equal to &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; has a good frame: a forking-like notion for types of singletons (in particular, it is [[stable]] in all cardinals). This gives rise to a well-behaved notion of [[dimension]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8940">In [[computer science]], a '''type signature''' or '''type annotation''' defines the inputs and outputs for a function, [[subroutine]] or [[Method (computer programming)|method]]. A type signature includes the number of arguments, the types of arguments and the order of the arguments contained by a function. A type signature is typically used during [[Type polymorphism|overload]] resolution for choosing the correct definition of a function to be called among many overloaded forms.

==Examples==
===C/C++===
In [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], the type signature is [[Declaration (computer programming)|declared]] by what is commonly known as a [[function prototype]]. In C/C++, a function [[declaration reflects use|declaration reflects its use]]; for example, a [[function pointer]] that would be invoked as:
&lt;source lang=C&gt;
char c;
double d;
int retVal = (*fPtr)(c, d);
&lt;/source&gt;

has the signature:

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
(int) (char, double);
&lt;/source&gt;

===Erlang===
In [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]], type signatures may be optionally declared, as:
&lt;source lang=Erlang&gt;
-spec(function_name(type1(), type2(), ...) -&gt; out_type()).
&lt;/source&gt;

For example:
&lt;source lang=Erlang&gt;
-spec(is_even(number()) -&gt; boolean()).
&lt;/source&gt;

===Haskell===
A type signature in the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell programming language]] is generally written in the following format:
&lt;source lang=Haskell&gt;
functionName :: arg1Type -&gt; arg2Type -&gt; ... -&gt; argNType
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that the type of the result can be regarded as everything past the first supplied argument. This is a consequence of [[currying]], which is made possible by Haskell's support for [[first-class function]]s; this function requires two inputs where one argument supplied and the function is "curried" to produce a function for the argument not supplied. Thus calling {{Haskell|f x}}, where {{Haskell|f :: a -&gt; b -&gt; c}}, yields a new function {{Haskell|f2 :: b -&gt; c}} that can be called {{Haskell|f2 b}} to produce {{Haskell|c}}.

The actual type specifications can consist of an actual type, such as {{Haskell|Integer}}, or a general [[type variable]] that is used in [[type polymorphism|parametric polymorphic]] [[function (programming)|functions]], such as {{Haskell|a}}, or {{Haskell|b}}, or {{Haskell|anyType}}. So we can write something like:
{{Haskell|functionName :: a -&gt; a -&gt; ... -&gt; a}}

Since Haskell supports [[higher-order function]]s, functions can be passed as arguments. This is written as:
{{Haskell|functionName :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a}}

This function takes in a function with type signature {{Haskell|a -&gt; a}} and returns data of type {{Haskell|a}} out.

===Java===
In the [[Java virtual machine]], ''internal type signatures'' are used to identify methods and classes at the level of the virtual machine code.

Example: The method {{Java|String String.substring(int, int)}} is represented in [[Java bytecode|bytecode]] as {{Java|Ljava/lang/String.substring(II)Ljava/lang/String;}}. The signature of &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method looks like this:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
&lt;/source&gt;

And in the disassembled bytecode, it takes the form of {{Java|Lsome/package/Main/main:([Ljava/lang/String;)V}}

The method signature for the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method contains three modifiers:

* &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method can be called by any object.
* &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method is a class method.
* &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; method has no return value.

==Signature==
{{tone|section|date=October 2013}}
A function signature consists of the function prototype.  It specifies the general information about a function like the name, scope and parameters.  Many programming languages use [[name mangling]] in order to pass along more semantic information from the compilers to the linkers.  In addition to mangling, there is an excess of information in a function signature (stored internally to most compilers) which is not readily available, but may be accessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C++ Reference: Programming terms|url=http://www.cs.unm.edu/~storm/C++/ProgrammingTerms/FunctionSignatures.html|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding the notion of a function signature is an important concept for all computer science studies.
* Modern object orientation techniques make use of [[Java interface|interfaces]], which are essentially templates made from function signatures.
* C/C++ uses function overloading with various signatures.

The practice of [[multiple inheritance]] requires consideration of the function signatures to avoid unpredictable results.

Computer science theory, and the concept of [[Polymorphism in object-oriented programming|polymorphism]] in particular, make much use of the concept of function signature.

In the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] signature is roughly equivalent to its [[Function prototype|prototype definition]].

The term "signature" may carry other meanings in computer science. For example:
* [[File signature]]s can identify or verify the content of a file.
* Database signatures can identify or verify the schema or a version of a database.
* In the [[ML programming language|ML]] family of [[programming language]]s, "signature" is used as a keyword referring to a construct of the module system that plays the role of an [[interface (computer science)|interface]].

==Method signature==
{{See also|Function prototype}}

In [[computer programming]], especially [[object-oriented programming]], a [[Method (computer programming)|method]] is commonly identified by its unique '''method signature''', which usually includes the method name, and the number, types and order of its [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| accessdate = 2011-05-31
| author = Paul Leahy
| location = http://www.about.com/
| publisher = About.com Guide
| title = Method Signature
| quote = A method signature is part of the method declaration. It is the combination of the method name and the parameter list.
| url = http://java.about.com/od/m/g/methodsignature.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A method signature is the smallest [[datatype|type]] of a method.

==Examples==
===C/C++===
In [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]], the method signature is the method name and the number and type of its [[parameter]]s, but it is possible to have a last parameter that consists of an array of values:
&lt;source lang=C&gt;
int printf(const char*, ... );
&lt;/source&gt;

Manipulation of these parameters can be done by using the routines in the standard library header [[stdarg.h|{{C-lang|&lt;stdarg.h&gt;}}]].

===C#===
Similar to the C syntax, [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] sees as the method signature its name and the number and type of its parameters, where the last parameter may be an array of values:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;source lang=Csharp&gt;
void Add(out int sum, params int[] value);
[...]
Add(out sum, 3, 5, 7, 11, -1);  // sum == 25
&lt;/source&gt;

===Java===
In the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], a method signature is the method name and the number, type and order of its parameters. Return types and thrown exceptions are not considered to be a part of the method signature. 
&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
methodName(parameters) {...};
break;
&lt;/source&gt;

For example, the following two methods have distinct signatures:
&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
doSomething(String[] y);
doSomething(String y);
&lt;/source&gt;

The following three methods do have the same signatures and are considered the same, as only the return value differs. The name of the parameter is not part of the method signature and is ignored by the compiler for checking method uniqueness.
&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
int doSomething(int y) 
String doSomething(int x)
int doSomething(int z) throws java.lang.Exception
&lt;/source&gt;

===Objective-C===
In the [[Objective-C]] programming language, method signatures for an object are declared in the interface header file. For example,
&lt;source lang=ObjC&gt;
- (id)initWithInt:(int)value;
&lt;/source&gt;

defines a method {{ObjC|initWithInt}} that returns a general object (an {{ObjC|id}}) and takes one integer argument. Objective-C only requires a type in a signature to be explicit when the type is not {{ObjC|id}}; this signature is equivalent:
&lt;source lang=ObjC&gt;
- initWithInt:(int)value;
&lt;/source&gt;

[[image:Pernes - Mesures anciennes.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Table of the measuring units used in the 17th century at [[Pernes-les-Fontaines]] in the covered market at [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] [[Regions of France|region]] of southeastern [[France]]]]

[[France]] has a unique history of [[units of measurement]] due to radical attempts to adopt a [[metric system]] following the [[French Revolution]].

In the [[Ancien régime]], before 1795, France used a system of measures that had many of the characteristics of the modern [[Imperial System]] of units. There was widespread abuse of the king's standards to the extent that the ''lieue'' could vary from 3.268&amp;nbsp;km in [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] to 5.849&amp;nbsp;km in [[Provence]]. In the revolutionary era, France used the first version of the metric system. This system was not well received by the public. Between 1812 and 1837, the ''[[mesures usuelles]]'' was used – traditional names were restored, but were based on metric units: for example, the livre became 500&amp;nbsp;g. After 1837, the metric system was reintroduced and has remained the principal system of use to this day.

== Ancien régime (to 1795) ==
{{main|Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution}}
In the pre-revolutionary era (before 1795), France used a system of measures that had many of the characteristics of the modern [[Imperial System]] of units, but there was no unified system of measurement. Charlemagne and successive kings had tried but failed to impose a unified system of measurement in France.&lt;ref name=histmet/&gt; (In England, by contrast, the [[Magna Carta]] decreed that "there shall be one unit of measure throughout the realm.")

The names and relationships of many units of measure were adopted from Roman units of measure and many more were added – it has been estimated that there were seven or eight hundred different names for the various units of measure. In addition, the quantity associated with each unit of measure differed from town to town and even from trade to trade to such an extent that the ''lieue'' (league) could vary from 3.268&amp;nbsp;km in [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] to 5.849&amp;nbsp;km in [[Provence]]. It has been estimated that, on the eve of the Revolution, a quarter of a million different units of measure were in use in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As an example, the weights and measures used at [[Pernes-les-Fontaines]] in southeastern France differ from those catalogued later in this article as having been used in Paris. In many cases, the names are different, while the ''livre'' is shown as being 403&amp;nbsp;g, as opposed to 489&amp;nbsp;g – the value of the ''livre du roi''. (The Imperial pound is about 453.6&amp;nbsp;g.)

== Revolutionary France (1795–1812)==
[[image:Horloge-republicaine4.jpg|150px|left|thumb|A clock of the republican era showing both [[Decimal time|decimal]] and [[standard time]].]]
The [[French Revolution]] and subsequent [[Napoleonic Wars]] marked the end of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The forces of change that had been brewing manifest themselves across all of France, including the way in which units of measure should be defined. The savants of the day favoured the use of a system of units that were inter-related and which used a decimal basis.

There was also a wish that the units of measure should be for all people and for all time and therefore not dependent on an artefact owned by any one particular nation. [[Talleyrand]], at the prompting of the savant [[Condorcet]], approached the British and the Americans in the early 1790s with proposals of a joint effort to define the metre. In the end, these approaches came to nothing and France decided to "go it alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author = Adler
|pages = 88–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Decimal time]] was introduced in the decree of 5 October 1793 under which the day was divided into 10 "decimal hours", the "hour" into 100 " decimal minutes" and the "decimal minute" into 100 "decimal seconds". The "decimal hour" corresponded to 2&amp;nbsp;hr&amp;nbsp;24&amp;nbsp;min, the "decimal minute" to 1.44&amp;nbsp;min and the "decimal second" to 0.864&amp;nbsp;s. 

The implementation of decimal time proved an immense task and under the article 22 of the law of 18 Germinal, Year III (7 April 1795), the use of decimal time was no longer mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[image:Obs-Paris-meridienne.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Paris meridian, which passes through the [[Observatoire de Paris]]. The metre was defined along this meridian using a survey that stretched from [[Dunkirk]] to [[Barcelona]].]]

The metric system of measure was first given a legal basis in 1795 by the [[French Revolution]]ary government. Article 5 of the law of 18 Germinal, Year III (7 April 1795) defined five units of measure. The units and their preliminary values were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aviatechno.free.fr/unites/nouveausys.php
|title =La loi du 18 Germinal an 3 (The law of 18 Germanial year 3) " la mesure [républicaine] de superficie pour les terrains, égale à un carré de dix mètres de côté "
|publisher = Le CIV (Centre d'Instruction de Vilgénis) – Forum des Anciens
|accessdate = 2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[metre]], for length – defined as being one ten millionth of the distance between the [[North Pole]] and the [[Equator]] through [[Paris]]
*The [[Hectare|are]]&amp;nbsp;(100&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for area [of land]
*The [[stère]]&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for volume of firewood
*The [[litre]]&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for volumes of liquid
*The [[gram]], for mass – defined as being the mass of one cubic centimetre of water

Decimal multiples and submultiples of these units would be defined by Greek [[SI prefix|prefixes]] - "myria", "kilo", "hecta" (100), "deka" - and Latin prefixes - "deci", "centi" and "milli". Using [[César-François Cassini de Thury|Cassini's]] survey of 1744, a provisional value of 443.44 ''lignes'' was assigned to the metre which, in turn, defined the other units of measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author = Adler
|page = 106}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The final value of the metre had to wait until 1799, when Delambre and Mechain presented the results of their [[History of the metre|survey between Dunkirk and Barcelona]] that fixed the length of the metre at 443.296 ''lignes''. The law 19 Frimaire An VIII (10 December 1799) defined the metre in terms of this value and the kilogram as being 18,827.15 ''grains''. These definitions enabled the construction of reference copies of the kilogram and metre, which were to be used as standards for the next 90 years.

At the same time, a new decimal-based system for [[angular measurement]] was implemented. The right angle was divided into 100 [[Grad (angle)|''grads'']], which in turn was divided in 100 ''centigrads''. An arc on the earth’s surface formed by an angle of one ''centigrad'' was one kilometre.

== ''Mesures usuelles'' (1812–1839)==
{{main|Mesures usuelles}}
[[image:Napoleon Groot.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The ''Mesures usuelles'' were introduced by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] in 1812]]
The metric system was introduced into France in 1795 on a district by district basis, starting with Paris. However, by modern standards, the introduction was poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, the Agency of Weights and Measures, which oversaw the introduction, underestimated the work involved. Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, yet one month after the metre became the sole legal unit of measure, there were only 25,000 in store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Adler |page = 269}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with other excesses of the Revolution made the metric system unpopular.

Napoleon ridiculed the metric system, but as an able administrator, he recognised the value of a sound basis for a system of measurement. Under the ''décret impérial du 12 février 1812'' (imperial decree of 12 February 1812), he introduced a revised system of measure – the ''mesures uselles'' or "customary measures" for use in small retail businesses. However, all government, legal and similar works still had to use the metric system and the metric system continued to be taught at all levels of education.&lt;ref name=Fevier&gt;{{cite web

|publisher = Ministère de l'Economie, des Finances et de l'Industrie 
|accessdate = 2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of many pre-metric units were reintroduced, but were redefined in terms of metric units. Thus the ''toise'' (fathom) was defined as being two metres with six ''pied'' (feet) making up one ''toise'', twelve ''pouce'' (inches) making up one ''pied'' and twelve ''lignes'' making up one ''pouce''. Likewise, the ''livre'' (pound) was defined as being 500&amp;nbsp;g, each ''livre'' comprising sixteen ''once'' and each ''once'' eight ''gros'' and the ''aune'' as 120 centimetres.&lt;ref name=H&amp;H&gt;{{cite web

== The metric system restored (1840–1875)==
''La loi du 4 juillet 1837'' (the law of 4 July 1837) effectively revoked the use of ''mesures usuelles'' by reaffirming the laws of measurement of 1795 and 1799 to be used from 1 May 1840.&lt;ref name=histmet&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.french-metrology.com/en/history/history-mesurement.asp
|title = History of measurement
|publisher = Métrologie française
|accessdate = 2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many units of measure, such as the ''livre'', remained in colloquial use for many years and the ''livre'' still does to some extent.

When this legislation was introduced, the metric system was beginning to take hold across Europe. [[Switzerland]] and the German state of [[Baden]] had both defined their ''Fuß'' (foot) as being 300&amp;nbsp;mm and the German state of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hessen-Darmstadt]] has defined its ''Fuß'' as being 250&amp;nbsp;mm. Moreover, the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Greece]], [[Lombardy]] and [[Venice]] had all adopted the metric system, albeit with local names for the "metre", "kilogram" and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author = Adler
|pages = 349–357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metric system was given a boost when the German ''[[Zollverein]]'' (Customs Union) introduced the ''Zollpfund'' of 500&amp;nbsp;g in 1850.

The [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851 in [[London]] was followed by international exhibitions in Paris in [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|1855]] and [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|1867]]. The 1867 exhibition had a stand showing how the diverse units of measure were converging onto the metric system – a system that had been developed in France and whose standards were in the custody of the French government, but available for world use.&lt;ref name=Europa1842&gt;{{cite web

In 1870, while France was preparing to host an international conference to discuss international cooperation in the sphere of units of measurement, the [[Franco-Prussian War|war]] broke out. France was humiliated by Prussia's military action, but in 1872 France seized the diplomatic initiative and re-issued the invitations for the 1870 conference. The conference met in 1875 and concluded with the signing of the [[Treaty of the Metre]]. The principal agreements under the treaty were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.bipm.org/en/convention/
|title = The Metre Convention
|publisher = ''Bureau international des poids et mesures''/[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM)

* A three-tier organisation would be put into place to provide political ([[CGPM]]), scientific ([[CIPM]]) and secretarial ([[BIPM]]) support for coordinating calibrations of national standards against an international standard.
* One of the eighteen seats on the CIPM would always be filled by a Frenchman.
* France would provide premises for the secretariat. These premises, at the [[Pavillon de Breteuil]], near [[Paris]] would have a diplomatic status.
* New prototypes of the kilogram and metre would be manufactured. These were ultimately made in England and delivered in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Thus the French metre and kilogram passed into international control.

== International era (1875 onwards) ==
During the early part of the twentieth century, the French introduced their own units of [[power (physics)|power]] - the ''[[poncelet]]'', which was defined as being the power required to raise a mass of 100&amp;nbsp;kg against [[standard gravity]] with a velocity of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s giving a value of 980.665&amp;nbsp;W.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many other European countries defined their units of power (the ''Pferdestärke'' in Germany, the ''paardekracht'' in the Netherlands and the ''cavallo vapore'' in Italy) using 75&amp;nbsp;kg rather than 100&amp;nbsp;kg, which gave a value of 735.49875&amp;nbsp;W (about 0.985&amp;nbsp;[[horsepower|HP]]). Eventually, the ''poncelet'' was replaced with the ''cheval vapeur'', which was identical to equivalent units of measure in neighbouring countries. In 1977, these units, along with the ''stere'' and the ''livre'' (and amongst others, the German ''pfund'') were proscribed by [[European units of measurement directives|EEC Directive 71/354/EEC]]

The symbol ''&amp;rho;'' ([[rho]]) is often used instead of ''r''.]]

NOTE: This page uses common physics notation for spherical coordinates, in which &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the ''z'' axis and the radius vector connecting the origin to the point in question, while &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the projection of the radius vector onto the ''x-y'' plane and the ''x'' axis. Several other definitions are in use, and so care must be taken in comparing different sources.&lt;ref name="wolfram"&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CylindricalCoordinates.html Wolfram Mathworld, spherical coordinates]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cylindrical coordinate system ==

=== Vector fields ===

Vectors are defined in [[cylindrical coordinates]] by (''ρ'', φ, ''z''), where
* ''ρ'' is the length of the vector projected onto the ''xy''-plane,
* φ is the angle between the projection of the vector onto the ''xy''-plane (i.e. ''r'') and the positive ''x''-axis (0 ≤ φ &lt; 2π),
* ''z'' is the regular ''z''-coordinate.

(''ρ'', φ, ''z'') is given in [[cartesian coordinates]] by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} \rho \\ \phi \\ z \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\ \operatorname{arctan}(y / x) \\ z
\end{bmatrix},\ \ \ 0 \le \phi &lt; 2\pi,
&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Physics Coordinates.png|thumb]]

or inversely by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} r\cos\theta \\ r\sin\theta \\ z \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Any [[vector field]] can be written in terms of the unit vectors as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A = A_x \mathbf{\hat x} + A_y \mathbf{\hat y} + A_z \mathbf{\hat z} 
                 = A_r \mathbf{\hat r} + A_\theta \boldsymbol{\hat \theta} + A_z \mathbf{\hat z}&lt;/math&gt;
The cylindrical unit vectors are related to the cartesian unit vectors by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{\hat r} \\ \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} \\ \mathbf{\hat z}\end{bmatrix}
  = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta &amp; \sin\theta &amp; 0 \\
                   -\sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{\hat x} \\ \mathbf{\hat y} \\ \mathbf{\hat z} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
* Note: the matrix is an [[orthogonal matrix]], that is, its [[Invertible matrix|inverse]] is simply its [[transpose]].

=== Time derivative of a vector field ===

To find out how the vector field A changes in time we calculate the time derivatives.
For this purpose we use [[Newton's notation]] for the time derivative (&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{A}}&lt;/math&gt;).
In cartesian coordinates this is simply:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{A}} = \dot{A}_x \hat{\mathbf{x}} + \dot{A}_y \hat{\mathbf{y}} + \dot{A}_z \hat{\mathbf{z}}&lt;/math&gt;

However, in cylindrical coordinates this becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{A}} = \dot{A}_r \hat{\boldsymbol{r}} + A_r \dot{\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}} 
  + \dot{A}_\theta \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} + A_\theta \dot{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}}
  + \dot{A}_z \hat{\boldsymbol{z}} + A_z \dot{\hat{\boldsymbol{z}}}&lt;/math&gt;

We need the time derivatives of the unit vectors. 
They are given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \dot{\hat{\mathbf{r}}} &amp; = \dot{\theta} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \\
  \dot{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}} &amp; = - \dot\theta \hat{\mathbf{r}} \\
  \dot{\hat{\mathbf{z}}} &amp; = 0
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So the time derivative simplifies to:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{A}} = \hat{\boldsymbol{r}} (\dot{A}_r - A_\theta \dot{\theta})
  + \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} (\dot{A}_\theta + A_r \dot{\theta})
  + \hat{\mathbf{z}} \dot{A}_z&lt;/math&gt;

=== Second time derivative of a vector field ===

The second time derivative is of interest in [[physics]], as it is found in [[equations of motion]] for [[classical mechanics|classical mechanical]] systems.
The second time derivative of a vector field in cylindrical coordinates is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot A} = \mathbf{\hat r} (\ddot A_r - A_\theta \ddot\theta - 2 \dot A_\theta \dot\theta - A_r \dot\theta^2)
  + \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} (\ddot A_\theta + A_r \ddot\theta + 2 \dot A_r \dot\theta - A_\theta \dot\theta^2)
  + \mathbf{\hat z} \ddot A_z&lt;/math&gt;

To understand this expression, we substitute A = P, where p is the vector (r, θ, z).

This means that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{P} = r \mathbf{\hat r} + z \mathbf{\hat z}&lt;/math&gt;.

After substituting we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{\hat r} (\ddot r - r \dot\theta^2)
  + \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} (r \ddot\theta + 2 \dot r \dot\theta)
  + \mathbf{\hat z} \ddot z&lt;/math&gt;

In mechanics, the terms of this expression are called:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \ddot r \mathbf{\hat r}          &amp;= \mbox{central outward acceleration} \\
  -r \dot\theta^2 \mathbf{\hat r}    &amp;= \mbox{centripetal acceleration} \\
  r \ddot\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\theta}      &amp;= \mbox{angular acceleration} \\
  2  \dot r \dot\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} &amp;= \mbox{Coriolis effect} \\
  \ddot z \mathbf{\hat z}               &amp;= \mbox{z-acceleration}
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

See also: [[Centripetal force]], [[Angular acceleration]], [[Coriolis effect]].

== Spherical coordinate system ==

=== Vector fields ===

Vectors are defined in [[spherical coordinates]] by (ρ,θ,φ), where
* ρ is the length of the vector,
* θ is the angle between the positive Z-axis and the vector in question (0 ≤ θ ≤ π), and
* φ is the angle between the projection of the vector onto the X-Y-plane and the positive X-axis (0 ≤ φ &lt; 2π).

(ρ,θ,φ) is given in [[Cartesian coordinates]] by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\rho \\ \theta \\ \phi \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\  \arccos(z / \rho) \\ \arctan(y / x)
\end{bmatrix},\ \ \ 0 \le \theta \le \pi,\ \ \ 0 \le \phi &lt; 2\pi,
&lt;/math&gt;

or inversely by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} \rho\sin\theta\cos\phi \\ \rho\sin\theta\sin\phi \\ \rho\cos\theta\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Any vector field can be written in terms of the unit vectors as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A = A_x\mathbf{\hat x} + A_y\mathbf{\hat y} + A_z\mathbf{\hat z} 
                 = A_\rho\boldsymbol{\hat \rho} + A_\theta\boldsymbol{\hat \theta} + A_\phi\boldsymbol{\hat \phi}&lt;/math&gt;
The spherical unit vectors are related to the cartesian unit vectors by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{\hat\rho} \\ \boldsymbol{\hat\theta}  \\ \boldsymbol{\hat\phi} \end{bmatrix}
  = \begin{bmatrix} \sin\theta\cos\phi &amp; \sin\theta\sin\phi &amp; \cos\theta \\
                    \cos\theta\cos\phi &amp; \cos\theta\sin\phi &amp; -\sin\theta \\
                    -\sin\phi          &amp; \cos\phi           &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{\hat x} \\ \mathbf{\hat y} \\ \mathbf{\hat z} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
* Note: the matrix is an [[orthogonal matrix]], that is, its inverse is simply its [[transpose]].

So the cartesian unit vectors are related to the spherical unit vectors by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{\hat x} \\ \mathbf{\hat y}  \\ \mathbf{\hat z} \end{bmatrix}
  = \begin{bmatrix} \sin\theta\cos\phi &amp; \cos\theta\cos\phi &amp; -\sin\phi \\
                    \sin\theta\sin\phi &amp; \cos\theta\sin\phi &amp;  \cos\phi \\
                    \cos\theta         &amp; -\sin\theta        &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{\hat\rho} \\ \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} \\ \boldsymbol{\hat\phi} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Time derivative of a vector field ===

To find out how the vector field A changes in time we calculate the time derivatives.
In cartesian coordinates this is simply:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot A} = \dot A_x \mathbf{\hat x} + \dot A_y \mathbf{\hat y} + \dot A_z \mathbf{\hat z}&lt;/math&gt;

However, in spherical coordinates this becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot A} = \dot A_\rho \boldsymbol{\hat \rho} + A_\rho \boldsymbol{\dot{\hat \rho}}
  + \dot A_\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} + A_\theta \boldsymbol{\dot{\hat\theta}}
  + \dot A_\phi \boldsymbol{\hat\phi} + A_\phi \boldsymbol{\dot{\hat\phi}}&lt;/math&gt;

We need the time derivatives of the unit vectors. 
They are given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \boldsymbol{\dot{\hat \rho}} &amp;= \dot\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} + \dot\phi\sin\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\phi} \\
  \boldsymbol{\dot{\hat\theta}} &amp;= - \dot\theta \boldsymbol{\hat \rho} + \dot\phi\cos\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\phi} \\
  \boldsymbol{\dot{\hat\phi}} &amp;= - \dot\phi\sin\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\rho} - \dot\phi\cos\theta \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So the time derivative becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot A} = \boldsymbol{\hat \rho} (\dot A_\rho - A_\theta \dot\theta - A_\phi \dot\phi \sin\theta)
  + \boldsymbol{\hat\theta} (\dot A_\theta + A_\rho \dot\theta - A_\phi \dot\phi \cos\theta)
  + \boldsymbol{\hat\phi} (\dot A_\phi + A_\rho \dot\phi \sin\theta + A_\theta \dot\phi \cos\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2701">In [[Chinese philosophy]], '''xin''' can refer to one's "disposition" or "feelings" ({{zh|c=心 |p=xīn}}), or to one's confidence or trust in something or someone ({{zh|c=信 |p=xìn}}). Literally, ''xin'' (心) refers to the physical heart, though it is sometimes translated as "mind" as the ancient Chinese believed the heart was the center of human [[cognition]]. For this reason, it is also sometimes translated as "heart-mind". It has a connotation of intention, yet can be used to refer to long-term goals.&lt;ref&gt;Shun, Kwong Loi, "Mencius", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2010/entries/mencius/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]], an important early [[Confucianism|Confucian]] thinker, considered ''xin'' (心) to be cultivated during one's life, in contrast to innate qualities of ''[[Nature (philosophy)#Eastern civilization and the philosophical question of nature|xing]]'' ({{zh|c=性 |p=xìng}}), or human nature.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, Dan, "Xunzi", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/xunzi/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Daoism|Daoist]] view, specifically from the philosopher [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], understands ''xin'' (心) as being socialized, with environmental pressures influencing personal intentions, sometimes in such a way that can provoke disagreements and conflict. While a Confucian might take heart that ''xin'' (心) may be cultivated in order to develop ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'', or moral virtue, Zhuangzi considered this socialization as detrimental to one's personal nature, somewhat along the lines of the later French philosopher, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. However, unlike Rousseau, [[René Descartes]] and many other [[Age of enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era European philosophers following the classical example of [[Plato]], emotion and reason were not considered separate entities, but rather as coextensive; ''xin'' (心) itself is a concept that is as much cognitive as emotional.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad, "Taoism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/taoism/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivanhoe, P.J., &amp; Van Norden, B.W. (Eds.) (2001).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9530">A '''zone diagram''' is a certain geometric object which a variation on the notion of [[Voronoi diagram]]. It was introduced by [[Tetsuo Asano]], [[Jiří Matoušek (mathematician)|Jiri Matousek]], and [[Takeshi Tokuyama]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=AMT2007zd/&gt;

Formally, it is a fixed point of a certain function. Its existence or uniqueness are not clear in advance and have been established only in specific cases. Its computation is not obvious too.

==A particular but informative case==
Consider a group of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; different points &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,\ldots,p_n\}&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Euclidean plane]]. Each point is called a site. When we speak about the [[Voronoi diagram]] induced by these sites, we associate to the site &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{p_k}&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R_k}&lt;/math&gt; of all points in the plane whose distance to the given site &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{p_k}&lt;/math&gt; is not greater to their distance to any other site &lt;math&gt;p_j,\,j\neq k&lt;/math&gt;. The collection &lt;math&gt;(R_k)_{k=1}^n&lt;/math&gt; of these regions is the Voronoi diagram associated with these sites, and it induces a decomposition of the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] into regions: the Voronoi regions (Voronoi cells).

In a zone diagram  the region associated with the site &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; is defined a little bit differently: instead of associating it the set of all points whose distance to &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; is not greater than their distance to the other sites, we associate to &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; the set &lt;math&gt;R_k&lt;/math&gt; of all points in the plane whose distance to &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; is not greater than their distance to any other region. Formally,

:&lt;math&gt;R_k=\{x\,|\,\,d(x,p_k)\leq d(x,R_j),\,\text{for all}\, j\neq k\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Here &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{d(a,b)}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[euclidean distance]] between the points &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(x,A)=\inf\{d(x,a) \,|\, a\in A\}&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, &lt;math&gt;x=(x_1,x_2)\in \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;  since we consider the plane. The tuple &lt;math&gt;(R_k)_{k=1}^n&lt;/math&gt; is the zone diagram associated with the sites.

The problem with this definition is that it seems circular:  in order to know &lt;math&gt;R_k&lt;/math&gt; we should know &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R_j}&lt;/math&gt; for each index &lt;math&gt;j,\,j\neq k&lt;/math&gt; but each such &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R_j}&lt;/math&gt; is defined in terms of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R_k}&lt;/math&gt;. On a second thought, we see that actually the [[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(R_k)_{k=1}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a solution of the following system of equations:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
R_1=\{x\in \mathbb{R}^2\,|\,\,d(x,p_1)\leq d(x,R_j),\,\text{for all}\, j\neq 1\}\\
\vdots\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\vdots\\
R_n=\{x\in \mathbb{R}^2\,|\,\,d(x,p_n)\leq d(x,R_j),\,\text{for all}\, j\neq n\}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Rigorously, a zone diagram is any solution of this system, if such a solution exists. This definition can be extended without essentially any change to higher dimensions, to sites which are not necessarily points, to infinitely many sites, etc.

==Interpretation==
In some settings, such as the one described above, a zone diagram can be interpreted as a certain equilibrium between mutually hostile kingdoms,.&lt;ref name=AMT2007zd/&gt;&lt;ref name=RR2009/&gt; In a discrete setting it can be interpreted as a stable configuration in a certain combinatorial game.&lt;ref name=RR2009/&gt;

==Formal definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(X,d)} &lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]] and let &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{K} &lt;/math&gt; be a set of at least 2 elements (indices), possibly infinite. Given a tuple &lt;math&gt; (P_k)_{k\in K} &lt;/math&gt; of nonempty subsets of &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{X} &lt;/math&gt;, called the sites, a zone diagram  with respect to this [[tuple]] is a tuple &lt;math&gt; R=(R_k)_{k\in K} &lt;/math&gt; of subsets of &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{X} &lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt; k\in K&lt;/math&gt; the following equation is satisfied:

:&lt;math&gt;
R_k=\{x\in X\,|\,\,d(x,P_k)\leq d(x,R_j),\,\text{for all}\, j\neq k\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Zone diagram as a fixed point==
The system of equations which defines the zone diagram can be represented as a fixed point of a function defined on a product space. Indeed, for each index &lt;math&gt;k\in K&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{X_k}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all nonempty subsets of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{X}&lt;/math&gt;.
Let

:&lt;math&gt;Y=\prod_{k\in K} X_k &lt;/math&gt;

and let &lt;math&gt;\text{Dom}:Y\to Y &lt;/math&gt; be the function defined by &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\text{Dom}(R)=S}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S=(S_k)_{k\in K}&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;
S_k=\{x\in X\,|\,\,d(x,P_k)\leq d(x,R_j),\,\text{for all}\, j\neq k\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a zone diagram if and only if it is a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of '''Dom''', that is, &lt;math&gt;R=\displaystyle{\text{Dom}(R)}&lt;/math&gt;. Viewing zone diagrams as fixed points is useful since in some settings known tools or approaches from [[fixed point theory]] can be used for investigating them and
deriving relevant properties (existence,  etc.).

==Existence and uniqueness==
Following the pioneering work of Asano et al.&lt;ref name=AMT2007zd/&gt; (existence and uniqueness of the zone diagram in the euclidean plane with respect to finitely many point sites), several existence or existence and uniqueness results have been published. As of 2012, the most general results which have been published are:

* '''2 sites (existence):''' there exists at least one zone diagram for any pair of arbitrary sites in any [[metric space]]. In fact, this existence result holds in any [[m-space]] &lt;ref name=RR2009/&gt; (a generalization of [[metric space]] in which, for instance, the distance function may be negative and may not satisfy the triangle inequality).
* '''More than 2 sites (existence):''' there exists a zone diagram of finitely many [[Compact space|compact]] and disjoint sites contained in the interior of a compact and [[convex subset]] of a [[uniformly convex space]]. This result actually holds in a more general setting.&lt;ref name=KRR20123/&gt;
* '''More than 2 sites (existence and uniqueness):''' there exists a unique zone diagram with respect to any collection (possibly infinite) of closed and positively separated sites in any finite-dimensional [[euclidean space]]. Positively separated means that there exists a positive lower bound on the distance between any two sites. A similar result was formulated for the case in which the normed space is  finite-dimensional and is both uniformly convex and uniformly smooth.&lt;ref name=KMT20123/&gt;
* '''non-uniqueness''': simple examples are known even for the case of two point sites,.&lt;ref name=RR2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=KMT20123/&gt;

==Computation==
More information is needed.

==Related objects and possible applications==
In addition to [[Voronoi diagrams]], zone diagrams are closely related to other geometric objects such as [[double zone diagrams]],&lt;ref name=RR2009/&gt; [[trisectors]],&lt;ref name=AMT2007dt/&gt; [[k-sectors]],&lt;ref name=IKMRT2010/&gt; [[mollified zone diagrams]]&lt;ref name=dBKK2011/&gt; and as a result may be used for solving problems related to robot motion and VLSI design,.&lt;ref name=AMT2007dt/&gt;&lt;ref name=IKMRT2010/&gt;
