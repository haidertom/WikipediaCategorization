This particularly is in the case of surveys or questionnaires that employ [[truism]]s, such as: "It is better to give than to receive" or "Never a lender nor a borrower be".

[[Douglas N. Jackson]] demonstrated acquiescence responding on the [[California F-scale]] (a measure of authoritarianism), which contains such truisms. He created a reverse-keyed version of the California F-scale where all the items were the opposite in meaning (see the two previous examples for a pair of such contradictory statements). He administered both the original and reverse-keyed versions of the California F-scale to the same group of respondents. One would expect that the correlation between these two scales to be negative, but there was a high, positive correlation. Jackson interpreted this as evidence of acquiescence responding. Respondents were merely being agreeable to the statements, regardless of the content.

Jackson and Messick, using factor analysis, also demonstrated that the two main factors explaining the majority of response variation on the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (MMPI) were for social desirability and acquiescence responding&lt;ref name="Messick"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Messick|first1=Samuel|last2=Jackson|first2=Douglas N.|title=Acquiescence and the factorial interpretation of the MMPI.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1961|volume=58|issue=4|pages=299–304|doi=10.1037/h0043979}}&lt;/ref&gt; (this would also hold true for the revised MMPI-2).

One approach to dealing with acquiescence responding on surveys and questionnaires is to employ a balance of positively and negatively keyed items in terms of the intended content. For example, in trying to assess depression it would be a good idea to also include items assessing happiness and contentedness, etc. (reversed-keyed items), in addition to the usual depressive content.&lt;ref name=EriksonTedin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erikson|first1=Robert S.|last2=Tedin|first2=Kent L.|title=American Public Opinion: Its Origins, Content and Impact|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317350385|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLXMCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85|date= 2015|language=en}}

'''Anomie''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|ə|ˌ|m|i}}) is a "condition in which society provides little [[Morality|moral]] guidance to individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerber |first=John J. Macionis, Linda M. |title=Sociology |year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3 |pages=97 |edition=7th Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the breakdown of social bonds between an individual and the community, e.g., under unruly scenarios resulting in fragmentation of social identity and rejection of self-regulatory [[Value (ethics)|values]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/chinas-school-killings-and-social-despair/?ref=world NYtimes blogs]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} 

The term is commonly understood to mean ''normlessness'', and believed to have been popularized by French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] in his influential book ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897). However, Durkheim first introduces the concept of anomie in his 1893 work ''The Division of Labour In Society''. Durkheim never used the term ''normlessness''; rather, he described anomie as "derangement", and "an insatiable will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mestrovic |first=Stjepan |title=Emile Durkheim and The Reformation of Sociology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim used the term "the malady of the infinite" because desire without limit can never be fulfilled; it only becomes more intense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43421884|title=Emile Durkheim : law in a moral domain|last=M.),|first=Cotterrell, Roger (Roger B.|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=0804738238|location=|pages=19|oclc=43421884|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Durkheim, anomie arises more generally from a mismatch between personal or group standards and wider social standards, or from the lack of a social ethic, which produces moral deregulation and an absence of legitimate aspirations. This is a nurtured condition:
{{quote |Most sociologists associate the term with Durkheim, who used the concept to speak of the ways in which an individual's actions are matched, or integrated, with a system of social norms and practices … anomie is a mismatch, not simply the absence of norms. Thus, a society with too much rigidity and little individual discretion could also produce a kind of anomie ...&lt;ref name="quot0"&gt;Susan Leigh Star, Geoffrey C. Bowker, and Laura J. Neumann, "Transparency At Different Levels of Scale: Convergence between Information Artifacts and Social Worlds", Library and Information Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

== History ==
In 1893 Durkheim introduced the concept of ''anomie'' to describe the mismatch of collective guild labour to evolving societal needs when the guild was homogeneous in its constituency. He equated homogeneous (redundant) skills to ''mechanical solidarity'' whose inertia retarded adaptation. He contrasted this with the self-regulating behaviour of a division of labour based on differences in constituency, equated to ''organic solidarity'', whose lack of inertia made it sensitive to needed changes.

Durkheim observed that the conflict between the evolved organic division of labour and the homogeneous mechanical type was such that one could not exist in the presence of the other.&lt;ref name="quot1"&gt;The Division of Labor in Society, The MacMillan Co. 1933, Free Press edition, 1964, pp. 182-183&lt;/ref&gt;

When solidarity is organic, anomie is impossible.&lt;ref name="quot4"&gt;The Division of Labor in Society, The MacMillan Co. 1933, Free Press edition, 1964, pp. 368-369&lt;/ref&gt; Sensitivity to mutual needs promotes evolution in the division of labour. "Producers, being near consumers, can easily reckon the extent of the needs to be satisfied. Equilibrium is established without any trouble and production regulates itself."&lt;ref name="quot4"/&gt; Durkheim contrasted the condition of anomie as being the result of a malfunction of organic solidarity after the transition to mechanical solidarity: {{quote|But on the contrary, if some opaque environment is interposed ... relations [are] rare, are not repeated enough ... are too intermittent. Contact is no longer sufficient. The producer can no longer embrace the market at a glance, nor even in thought. He can no longer see its limits, since it is, so to speak limitless. Accordingly, production becomes unbridled and unregulated.&lt;ref name="quot4"/&gt;}}

Durkheim's use of the term anomie was about the phenomenon of industrialization—mass-regimentation that could not adapt due to its own inertia—its resistance to change, which causes disruptive cycles of collective behavior e.g. economics, due to the necessity of a prolonged buildup of sufficient force or momentum to overcome the inertia.

Later in 1897, in his studies of suicide, Durkheim associated anomie to the influence of a lack of norms or norms that were too rigid. But such normlessness or norm-rigidity was a ''symptom of anomie'', caused by the lack of differential adaptation that would enable norms to evolve naturally due to self-regulation, either to develop norms where none existed or to change norms that had become rigid and obsolete.

In 1938 Robert K. Merton linked anomie with [[Robert K. Merton#Theory of deviance|deviance]] and argued that the discontinuity between culture and structure have the dysfunctional consequence of leading to deviance within society. He described 5 types of deviance in terms of the acceptance or rejection of social goals and the institutionalized means of achieving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|date=1938|title=Social Structure and Anomie|jstor=2084686|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=3|issue=5|pages=672–682|doi=10.2307/2084686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{See also|Antinomianism}}
The word, "a reborrowing with French spelling of ''anomy''",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|anomie}}&lt;/ref&gt; comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνομία}} "lawlessness",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|anomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)nomi/a|ἀνομία|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; namely the [[privative alpha]] [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] (''a-'' "without"), and ''nomos'' "law". The Greeks distinguished between ''nomos'' ({{lang|grc|νόμος}}, "law"), and ''arché'' ({{lang|grc|ἀρχή}}, "starting rule, axiom, principle"). For example, a [[monarch]] is a single ruler but he or she might still be subject to, and not exempt from, the prevailing laws, i.e. ''nomos''. In the original [[city state]] [[democracy]], the [[majority rule]] was an aspect of ''arché'' because it was a rule-based, customary system, which might or might not make laws, i.e. ''nomos''. Thus, the original meaning of ''anomie'' defined anything or anyone against or outside the law, or a condition where the current laws were not applied resulting in a state of illegitimacy or lawlessness.

The contemporary English understanding of the word ''anomie'' can accept greater flexibility in the word "[[norm (sociology)|norm]]", and some have used the idea of normlessness to reflect a similar situation to the idea of [[Anarchism|anarchy]]. But, as used by Émile Durkheim and later theorists, ''anomie'' is a reaction against or a retreat from the regulatory [[social control]]s of [[society]], and is a completely separate concept from anarchy, which consists of the absence of the roles of rulers and submitted.

== Social disorder ==

The nineteenth century [[France|French]] pioneer [[sociologist]] Émile Durkheim borrowed the word from French philosopher [[Jean-Marie Guyau]] and used it in his influential book ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), outlining the social (and not individual) causes of [[suicide]], characterized by a rapid change of the standards or values of societies (often erroneously referred to as normlessness), and an associated feeling of [[Social alienation|alienation]] and purposelessness. He believed that ''anomie'' is common when the surrounding society has undergone significant changes in its economic fortunes, whether for better or for worse and, more generally, when there is a significant discrepancy between the ideological theories and values commonly professed and what was actually achievable in everyday life. This was contrary to previous theories on suicide which generally maintained that suicide was precipitated by negative events in a person's life and their subsequent [[clinical depression|depression]].

In Durkheim's view, traditional [[religion]]s often provided the basis for the shared values which the anomic individual lacks. Furthermore, he argued that the [[division of labor]] that had been prevalent in economic life since the [[Industrial Revolution]] led individuals to pursue [[egotism|egoistic]] ends rather than seeking the good of a larger community. [[Robert King Merton]] also adopted the idea of anomie to develop [[Strain theory (sociology)|strain theory]], defining it as the discrepancy between common social goals and the legitimate means to attain those goals. In other words, an individual suffering from anomie would strive to attain the common goals of a specific society yet would not be able to reach these goals legitimately because of the [[structuralism|structural]] limitations in society. As a result, the individual would exhibit [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]]. [[Friedrich Hayek]] notably uses the word ''anomie'' with this meaning.

According to one academic survey, psychometric testing confirmed a link between anomie and [[academic dishonesty]] among university students, suggesting that universities needed to foster codes of ethics among students in order to curb it.&lt;ref&gt;"The effect of anomie on academic dishonesty among university students" by Albert Caruana, B. Ramaseshan, Michael T. Ewing. ''International Journal of Educational Management'' (2000). Volume 14, issue 1. pp. 23–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, anomie was seen as a "push factor" in tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an older variant, the 1913 ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' reports use of the word ''anomie'' as meaning "disregard or violation of the law"&lt;ref&gt;"Anomie, authoritarianism, and prejudice: A replication" by A. H. Roberts, M. Rokeach, ''American Journal of Sociology'', 1956&lt;/ref&gt; but anomie as a social disorder is not to be confused with [[anarchy]]. Proponents of [[anarchism]] claim that anarchy does not necessarily lead to anomie and that hierarchical command actually increases lawlessness. Some [[anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivists]] argue that complex societies, particularly industrial and post-industrial societies, directly cause conditions such as anomie by depriving the individual of self-determination and a relatively small reference group to relate to, such as the band, clan, or tribe.

== In literature, film, and theatre ==

In [[Albert Camus]]'s [[existentialist novel]] ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', the bored, alienated protagonist Meursault struggles to construct an individual system of values as he responds to the disappearance of the old. He exists largely in a state of anomie,&lt;ref name=wilson1&gt;{{cite book|title=The Study of Lives: Essays on Personality in Honor of Henry A. Murray|year=1963|publisher=Atherton Prentice-Hall|pages=352–359|author=Robert N. Wilson|edition=First|editor=Robert W. White|chapter=15, Albert Camus: Personality as Creative Struggle}}&lt;/ref&gt; as seen from the apathy evinced in the opening lines: ''{{lang|fr|"Aujourd’hui, maman est morte. Ou peut-être hier, je ne sais pas"}}'' ("Today mother died. Or maybe yesterday, I don't know").

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] expressed a similar concern about anomie in his novel ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''. [[The Grand Inquisitor]] remarks that in the absence of God and immortal life, everything would be lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Civilization Survive Without God?

Unfortunately, these are problems of human society and the human psyche — you might say, soul — whatever attitude we take to the humanness or the transcendent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, that any act becomes thinkable, that there is no moral compass, which leads to apathy and detachment.

'''Aníbal López (A-1 53167)''', full name Aníbal Asdrúbal López Juarez (April 13, 1964 &amp;ndash; September 26, 2014) was an [[artist]] and a native of [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfacts.net/en/artist/a-1-53167-22887/profile.html Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He began his career creating [[figurative art]] influenced by [[expressionism]]. He has worked in several media, including acrylic and oil on canvas, photography, and video. In the 1990s he and other Guatemalan artists such as [[Regina José Galindo]] began creating art "actions" or [[live art]], a combination of [[street art]], [[performance art]], [[minimalism]], and [[conceptual art]]. A-1 53167 is the code name (his Guatemalan ID card number) that Aníbal López has used since 1997 to sign many of his art actions as a way to show how he questions codes of information regarding identity.The effect is to erase an ethnic-specific sense of belonging and perhaps to resist the impulse of art consumers to categorize him in preconceived categories such as indigenous, [[Maya peoples|Mayan]], or Guatemalan.

==Actions==
Aníbal López, or A-1 53167, creates street interventions that combine the rationalist detachment of [[conceptual art]] with the political bravado of Latin American guerrilla fighters. In "El Préstamo" ("The Loan"), a gun-toting A-1 53167 staged an armed robbery by attacking an unwitting passer-by. The stolen money was used to fund an exhibition at the "Contexto" art space, thus transforming the victim into an art sponsor and the spectator into an accomplice in the event.&lt;ref name="kunstaspekte.de"&gt;http://www.kunstaspekte.de/index.php?tid=9324&amp;action=termin Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gasart.it"&gt;http://www.gasart.it/gallery/en/006/opere_9.html Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 at the 49th [[Venice Biennale]], he exhibited photographs from a 2000 action in which he scattered the contents of ten large bags of coal across the main boulevard in the center of Guatemala City where a military parade was to take place.&lt;ref name="gasart.it"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/n.paradoxa/venice.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515022114/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/n.paradoxa/venice.htm |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }} Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mutualart.com/ArtistHistory/A_1_53167/6512769A884B362C?Promo=C35E0524722A8338 Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The action was intended to remind the military of the crimes and massacres it committed against the country's citizens during the 36-year civil war when more than 200 000 civilians were killed - mostly members of the indigenous Maya Indian community. The military committed human rights abuses including some acts that have been judged to be genocide, as documented by [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Rigoberta Menchú]] and others. In an interview with Biennale organizers, the artist stated, "There is a close relationship namely, between the coal, the massacres, and the military, because this material can always be found in the mass graves. In most cases, houses and corpses are burned. I knew that the coal would be cleared away before the parade. I scattered it at about two o'clock in the morning, and at seven o'clock it had already been removed. But there were still traces left. I wanted the military to walk over these traces, and to be able to take photos of the marching army. Since I work with signs that have somehow established themselves, in this case the coal that points to the massacres and the mass graves, I refer with the action to existing problems, without becoming too obvious. It wasn't my intention for the spectators to perceive these signs, but rather that the military itself should notice them."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universes-in-universe.de/car/venezia/bien49/plat1/e-a1-53167-int.htm Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

At the opening of his Berlin exhibition in 2004, he presented another action, this time aimed at the art world. He arranged for six security guards to prevent the public from any contact with the art, the objects, and other people, all under a prohibition sign that said "Do it right".&lt;ref name="kunstaspekte.de"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prometeogallery.com"&gt;http://www.prometeogallery.com/eventsdetnew.asp?lang=en&amp;num=7 Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

For "One Ton Of Books Dumped On Reform Avenue," a dump truck stopped in the middle of [[Guatemala City]]'s Avenida La Reforma, a major artery, dumped its load of used books, and drove away. Local traffic was disrupted and had to maneuver around the pile of seeming rubbish. Pedestrians joined the fracas, moving into the boulevard to pick through the abandoned books, taking anything that interested them. The action was memorialized in a video.&lt;ref name="stewarthomesociety.org"&gt;http://stewarthomesociety.org/blog/?p=1269 Retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Lopez paid smugglers to transport empty boxes into Brazil, resulting in the action, "Sculpture Composed of 500 Boxes of Contraband Transported from Paraguay to Brazil," also memorialized in a video.&lt;ref name="stewarthomesociety.org"/&gt;

In "Roll of 120m x 4m Black Plastic Hanging From The Incienso Bridge" (2003), Lopez attached a long ribbon of plastic to a bridge, where it then floated in the air above a valley.&lt;ref name="stewarthomesociety.org"/&gt;

He is represented by Prometeogallery, [[Milan]], [[Italy]], and The 9.99 Gallery, [[Guatemala City]].

{{Distinguish|Arbitration}}
In [[economics]] and [[finance]], '''arbitrage''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑːr|b|ᵻ|t|r|ɑː|ʒ}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|-|t|r|ɪ|dʒ}}) is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more [[Market (economics)|markets]]: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the [[market price]]s. When used by academics, an arbitrage is a (imagined, hypothetical, thought experiment) transaction that involves no negative [[cash flow]] at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility of a risk-free profit after transaction costs. For example, an arbitrage opportunity is present when there is the opportunity to instantaneously buy something for a low price and sell it for a higher price.

In principle and in academic use, an arbitrage is risk-free; in common use, as in [[statistical arbitrage]], it may refer to ''expected'' profit, though losses may occur, and in practice, there are always [[#Risks|risks]] in arbitrage, some minor (such as fluctuation of prices decreasing profit margins), some major (such as devaluation of a currency or derivative). In academic use, an arbitrage involves taking advantage of differences in price of a ''single'' asset or ''identical'' cash-flows; in common use, it is also used to refer to differences between ''similar'' assets ([[relative value (economics)|relative value]] or [[convergence trade]]s), as in [[merger arbitrage]].

People who engage in arbitrage are called '''arbitrageurs''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑːr|b|ᵻ|t|r|ɑː|ˈ|ʒ|ɜːr}}—such as a bank or brokerage firm. The term is mainly applied to trading in [[financial instrument]]s, such as [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], [[stock]]s, [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], [[Commodity|commodities]] and [[Currency|currencies]].

Arbitrage has the effect of causing prices of the same or very similar assets in different markets to converge.

==Etymology==
"Arbitrage" is a French word and denotes a decision by an arbitrator or arbitration tribunal. (In modern French, "{{lang|fr|arbitre}}" usually means [[referee]] or [[umpire]].) In the sense used here, it was first defined in 1704 by [[Mathieu de la Porte]] in his treatise "{{lang|fr|La science des négociants et teneurs de livres}}" as a consideration of different exchange rates to recognise the most profitable places of issuance and settlement for a bill of exchange ("{{lang|fr|L'arbitrage est une combinaison que l’on fait de plusieurs changes, pour connoitre}} [{{lang|fr|connaître}}, in modern spelling] {{lang|fr|quelle place est plus avantageuse pour tirer et remettre}}".)&lt;ref&gt;See "Arbitrage" in [http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/arbitrage Trésor de la Langue Française].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arbitrage-free==
If the market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, the prices are said to constitute an '''arbitrage equilibrium''', or an '''arbitrage-free''' market. An arbitrage equilibrium is a precondition for a [[general equilibrium|general economic equilibrium]]. The "no arbitrage" assumption is used in [[quantitative finance]] to calculate a unique [[risk neutral]] price for [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.corespreads.com/knowledge-base/arbitrage/|title=Arbitrage – Knowledge Base|website=www.corespreads.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arbitrage-free pricing approach for bonds==
This refers to the method of valuing a coupon-bearing financial instrument by discounting its future cash flows by multiple discount rates. By doing so, a more accurate price can be obtained than if the price is calculated with a present-value pricing approach. Arbitrage-free pricing is used for bond valuation and to detect arbitrage opportunities for investors.

For the purpose of valuing the price of a bond, its cash flows can each be thought of as packets of incremental cash flows with a large packet upon maturity, being the principal. Since the cash flows are dispersed throughout future periods, they must be discounted back to the present. In the present-value approach, the cash flows are discounted with one discount rate to find the price of the bond. In arbitrage-free pricing, multiple discount rates are used.

The present-value approach assumes that the yield of the bond will stay the same until maturity. This is a simplified model because interest rates may fluctuate in the future, which in turn affects the yield on the bond. The discount rate may be different for each of the cash flows for this reason. Each cash flow can be considered a zero-coupon instrument that pays one payment upon maturity. The discount rates used should be the rates of multiple zero-coupon bonds with maturity dates the same as each cash flow and similar risk as the instrument being valued. By using multiple discount rates, the arbitrage-free price is the sum of the [[discounted cash flow]]s. Arbitrage-free price refers to the price at which no price arbitrage is possible.

The ideas of using multiple discount rates obtained from zero-coupon bonds and discount a similar bonds cash flow to find its price is derived from the yield curve. The yield curve is a curve of the yields of the same bond with different maturities. This curve can be used to view trends in market expectations of how interest rates will move in the future. In arbitrage-free pricing of a bond, a yield curve of similar zero-coupon bonds with different maturities is created. If the curve were to be created with Treasury securities of different maturities, they would be stripped of their coupon payments through bootstrapping. This is to transform the bonds into zero-coupon bonds. The yield of these zero-coupon bonds would then be plotted on a diagram with time on the ''x''-axis and yield on the ''y''-axis.

Since the yield curve displays market expectations on how yields and interest rates may move, the arbitrage-free pricing approach is more realistic than using only one discount rate. Investors can use this approach to value bonds and find mismatches in prices, resulting in an arbitrage opportunity. If a bond valued with the arbitrage-free pricing approach turns out to be priced higher in the market, an investor could have such an opportunity:
#Investor goes short the bond at price at time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
#Investor goes long the zero-coupon bonds making up the related yield curve and strip and sell any coupon payments at t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
#As t&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; the price spread between the prices will decrease.
#At maturity the prices will converge and be equal. Investor exits both the long and short position, realizing a profit.

If the outcome from the valuation were the reversed case, the opposite positions would be taken in the bonds. This arbitrage opportunity comes from the assumption that the prices of bonds with the same properties will converge upon maturity. This can be explained through market efficiency, which states that arbitrage opportunities will eventually be discovered and corrected accordingly. The prices of the bonds in t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; move closer together to finally become the same at t&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Conditions for arbitrage==
Arbitrage is possible when one of three conditions is met:

#The same asset does not trade at the same price on all markets ("[[law of one price|the law of one price]]").
#Two assets with identical cash flows do not trade at the same price.
#An asset with a known price in the future does not today trade at its future price [[Discounting|discounted]] at the [[risk-free interest rate]] (or, the asset has significant costs of storage; as such, for example, this condition holds for grain but not for [[security (finance)|securities]]).

Arbitrage is not simply the act of buying a product in one market and selling it in another for a higher price at some later time. The transactions must occur ''simultaneously'' to avoid exposure to market risk, or the risk that prices may change on one market before both transactions are complete. In practical terms, this is generally possible only with securities and financial products that can be traded electronically, and even then, when each leg of the trade is executed the prices in the market may have moved. Missing one of the legs of the trade (and subsequently having to trade it soon after at a worse price) is called 'execution risk' or more specifically 'leg risk'.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As an arbitrage consists of at least two trades, the metaphor is of putting on a pair of pants, one leg (trade) at a time. The risk that one trade (leg) fails to execute is thus 'leg risk'.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest example, any good sold in one market should sell for the same price in another. [[Merchant|Traders]] may, for example, find that the price of wheat is lower in agricultural regions than in cities, purchase the good, and transport it to another region to sell at a higher price. This type of price arbitrage is the most common, but this simple example ignores the cost of transport, storage, risk, and other factors. "True" arbitrage requires that there is no market risk involved. Where securities are traded on more than one exchange, arbitrage occurs by simultaneously buying in one and selling on the other.

See [[rational pricing]], particularly [[rational pricing#Arbitrage mechanics|§ arbitrage mechanics]], for further discussion.

Mathematically it is defined as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;P(V_t \geq 0) = 1 \text{ and } P(V_t \neq 0) &gt; 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_t&lt;/math&gt; denotes the portfolio value at time&amp;nbsp;''t''.

==Price convergence==
Arbitrage has the effect of causing prices in different markets to converge. As a result of arbitrage, the currency [[exchange rate]]s, the price of [[Commodity|commodities]], and the price of securities in different markets tend to converge. The speed&lt;ref name=DamghaniCointelation&gt;{{cite journal |first=Babak |last=Mahdavi Damghani |year=2013|title= The Non-Misleading Value of Inferred Correlation: An Introduction to the Cointelation Model |journal=[[Wilmott]] |volume=2013 |issue=1 |pages=50–61 |doi= 10.1002/wilm.10252}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which they do so is a measure of market efficiency. Arbitrage tends to reduce [[price discrimination]] by encouraging people to buy an item where the price is low and resell it where the price is high (as long as the buyers are not prohibited from reselling and the transaction costs of buying, holding and reselling are small relative to the difference in prices in the different markets).

Arbitrage moves different currencies toward [[purchasing power parity]]. As an example, assume that a car purchased in the United States is cheaper than the same car in Canada. Canadians would buy their cars across the border to exploit the arbitrage condition. At the same time, Americans would buy US cars, transport them across the border, then sell them in Canada. Canadians would have to buy American dollars to buy the cars and Americans would have to sell the Canadian dollars they received in exchange. Both actions would increase demand for US dollars and supply of Canadian dollars. As a result, there would be an appreciation of the US currency. This would make US cars more expensive and Canadian cars less so until their prices were similar. On a larger scale, international arbitrage opportunities in [[commodity|commodities]], goods, [[Security (finance)|securities]] and [[currency|currencies]] tend to change [[exchange rate]]s until the [[purchasing power]] is equal.

In reality, most [[asset]]s exhibit some difference between countries. These, [[transaction cost]]s, taxes, and other costs provide an impediment to this kind of arbitrage. Similarly, arbitrage affects the difference in interest rates paid on government bonds issued by the various countries, given the expected depreciation in the currencies relative to each other (see [[interest rate parity]]).

==Risks==
Arbitrage transactions in modern securities markets involve fairly low day-to-day risks, but can face extremely high risk in rare situations,&lt;ref name=DamghaniCointelation /&gt; particularly [[Financial crisis|financial crises]], and can lead to [[bankruptcy]]. Formally, arbitrage transactions have [[negative skew]] – prices can get a small amount closer (but often no closer than 0), while they can get very far apart. The day-to-day risks are generally small because the transactions involve small differences in price, so an execution failure will generally cause a small loss (unless the trade is very big or the price moves rapidly). The rare case risks are extremely high because these small price differences are converted to large profits via [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] (borrowed money), and in the rare event of a large price move, this may yield a large loss.

The main day-to-day risk is that part of the transaction fails – execution risk. The main rare risks are counterparty risk and liquidity risk – that a counterparty to a large transaction or many transactions fails to pay, or that one is required to post [[margin (finance)|margin]] and does not have the money to do so.

In the academic literature, the idea that seemingly very low risk arbitrage trades might not be fully exploited because of these risk factors and other considerations is often referred to as [[limits to arbitrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shleifer|first1=Andrei|first2=Robert|last2=Vishny|year=1997|title=The limits of arbitrage|journal=Journal of Finance|volume=52|pages=35–55|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1997.tb03807.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.184.9959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xiong|first1=Wei|year=2001|title=Convergence trading with wealth effects|journal=Journal of Financial Economics|volume=62|issue=2|pages=247–292|doi=10.1016/s0304-405x(01)00078-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kondor|first1=Peter|year=2009|title=Risk in Dynamic Arbitrage: Price Effects of Convergence Trading|journal=Journal of Finance|volume=64|issue=2|pages=638–658|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01445.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.113.688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Execution risk===
Generally it is impossible to close two or three transactions at the same instant; therefore, there is the possibility that when one part of the deal is closed, a quick shift in prices makes it impossible to close the other at a profitable price. However, this is not necessarily the case. Many exchanges and inter-dealer brokers allow multi legged trades (e.g. basis block trades on LIFFE).

Competition in the marketplace can also create risks during arbitrage transactions. As an example, if one was trying to profit from a price discrepancy between IBM on the NYSE and IBM on the London Stock Exchange, they may purchase a large number of shares on the NYSE and find that they cannot simultaneously sell on the LSE.  This leaves the arbitrageur in an unhedged risk position.

In the 1980s, [[risk arbitrage]] was common. In this form of [[speculation]], one trades a security that is clearly undervalued or overvalued, when it is seen that the wrong valuation is about to be corrected by events. The standard example is the stock of a company, undervalued in the stock market, which is about to be the object of a takeover bid; the price of the takeover will more truly reflect the value of the company, giving a large profit to those who bought at the current price—if the merger goes through as predicted. Traditionally, arbitrage transactions in the securities markets involve high speed, high volume and low risk. At some moment a price difference exists, and the problem is to execute two or three balancing transactions while the difference persists (that is, before the other arbitrageurs act). When the transaction involves a delay of weeks or months, as above, it may entail considerable risk if borrowed money is used to magnify the reward through leverage. One way of reducing this risk is through the [[Insider trading|illegal use of inside information]], and in fact risk arbitrage with regard to [[leveraged buyout]]s was associated with some of the famous financial scandals of the 1980s such as those involving [[Michael Milken]] and [[Ivan Boesky]].

===Mismatch===
{{details|Convergence trade}}
Another risk occurs if the items being bought and sold are not identical and the arbitrage is conducted under the assumption that the prices of the items are correlated or predictable; this is more narrowly referred to as a [[convergence trade]]. In the extreme case this is merger arbitrage, described below. In comparison to the classical quick arbitrage transaction, such an operation can produce disastrous losses.

===Counterparty risk===
As arbitrages generally involve ''future'' movements of cash, they are subject to [[counterparty risk]]: if a counterparty fails to fulfill their side of a transaction. This is a serious problem if one has either a single trade or many related trades with a single counterparty, whose failure thus poses a threat, or in the event of a financial crisis when many counterparties fail. This hazard is serious because of the large quantities one must trade in order to make a profit on small price differences.

For example, if one purchases many risky bonds, then hedges them with [[Credit default swap|CDSes]], profiting from the difference between the bond spread and the CDS premium, in a financial crisis the bonds may default ''and'' the CDS writer/seller may itself fail, due to the stress of the crisis, causing the arbitrageur to face steep losses.

===Liquidity risk===
{{rquote|right|Markets can remain irrational far longer than you or I can remain solvent.|[[John Maynard Keynes]]}}
Arbitrage trades are necessarily synthetic, ''leveraged'' trades, as they involve a short position. If the assets used are not identical (so a price divergence makes the trade temporarily lose money), or the margin treatment is not identical, and the trader is accordingly required to post [[margin (finance)|margin]] (faces a [[margin call]]), the trader may run out of capital (if they run out of cash and cannot borrow more) and be forced to sell these assets at a loss even though the trades may be expected to ultimately make money. In effect, arbitrage traders synthesize a [[put option]] on their ability to finance themselves.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purearb.com/purearb/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/desco_market_insights_vol_1_no_1_20090313.pdf|format=pdf|title=The Basis Monster That Ate Wall Street|publisher=[[D. E. Shaw &amp; Co.]]|accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prices may diverge during a financial crisis, often termed a "[[flight to quality]]"; these are precisely the times when it is hardest for leveraged investors to raise capital (due to overall capital constraints), and thus they will lack capital precisely when they need it most.&lt;ref name="bm" /&gt;

==Types of arbitrage==

===Spatial arbitrage===
Also known as '''geographical arbitrage''', this is the simplest form of arbitrage. In spatial arbitrage, an arbitrageur looks for price differences between geographically separate markets. For example, there may be a bond dealer in Virginia offering a bond at 100-12/23 and a dealer in Washington bidding 100-15/23 for the same bond. For whatever reason, the two dealers have not spotted the difference in the prices, but the arbitrageur does. The arbitrageur immediately buys the bond from the Virginia dealer and sells it to the Washington dealer.

===Merger arbitrage===
Also called [[risk arbitrage]], merger arbitrage generally consists of buying/holding the stock of a company that is the target of a [[takeover]] while [[Short (finance)|shorting]] the stock of the acquiring company.

Usually the market price of the target company is less than the price offered by the acquiring company.
The spread between these two prices depends mainly on the probability and the timing of the takeover being completed as well as the prevailing level of interest rates.

The bet in a merger arbitrage is that such a spread will eventually be zero, if and when the takeover is completed.  The risk is that the deal "breaks" and the spread massively widens.

===Municipal bond arbitrage===
Also called ''municipal bond relative value arbitrage'', ''municipal arbitrage'', or just ''muni arb'', this hedge fund strategy involves one of two approaches. The term "arbitrage" is also used in the context of the Income Tax Regulations governing the investment of proceeds of municipal bonds; these regulations, aimed at the issuers or beneficiaries of tax-exempt municipal bonds, are different and, instead, attempt to remove the issuer's ability to arbitrage between the low tax-exempt rate and a taxable investment rate.

Generally, managers seek relative value opportunities by being both long and short municipal bonds with a duration-neutral book. The relative value trades may be between different issuers, different bonds issued by the same entity, or capital structure trades referencing the same asset (in the case of revenue bonds). Managers aim to capture the inefficiencies arising from the heavy participation of non-economic investors (i.e., high income "[[buy and hold]]" investors seeking tax-exempt income) as well as the "crossover buying" arising from corporations' or individuals' changing income tax situations (i.e., insurers switching their munis for corporates after a large loss as they can capture a higher after-tax yield by offsetting the taxable corporate income with underwriting losses). There are additional inefficiencies arising from the highly fragmented nature of the municipal bond market which has two million outstanding issues and 50,000 issuers, in contrast to the Treasury market which has 400 issues and a single issuer.

Second, managers construct leveraged portfolios of AAA- or AA-rated tax-exempt municipal bonds with the duration risk hedged by [[Short selling|shorting]] the appropriate ratio of taxable corporate bonds. These corporate equivalents are typically [[interest rate swap]]s referencing [[Libor#Libor-based derivatives|Libor]] or [[Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association|SIFMA]] [http://www.investinginbonds.com/story.asp?id=351] [http://www.bondmarkets.com/story.asp?id=1157]. The arbitrage manifests itself in the form of a relatively cheap longer maturity municipal bond, which is a municipal bond that yields significantly more than 65% of a corresponding taxable corporate bond. The steeper slope of the municipal [[yield curve]] allows participants to collect more after-tax income from the municipal bond portfolio than is spent on the interest rate swap; the carry is greater than the hedge expense. Positive, tax-free carry from muni arb can reach into the double digits. The bet in this municipal bond arbitrage is that, over a longer period of time, two similar instruments—municipal bonds and interest rate swaps—will correlate with each other; they are both very high quality credits, have the same maturity and are denominated in the same currency. Credit risk and duration risk are largely eliminated in this strategy. However, basis risk arises from use of an imperfect hedge, which results in significant, but range-bound principal volatility. The end goal is to limit this principal volatility, eliminating its relevance over time as the high, consistent, tax-free cash flow accumulates. Since the inefficiency is related to government tax policy, and hence is structural in nature, it has not been arbitraged away.

Note, however, that many municipal bonds are callable, and that this imposes substantial additional risks to the strategy.

===Convertible bond arbitrage===
A [[convertible bond]] is a [[bond (finance)|bond]] that an investor can return to the issuing company in exchange for a predetermined number of shares in the company.

A convertible bond can be thought of as a [[corporate bond]] with a stock [[call option]] attached to it.

The price of a convertible bond is sensitive to three major factors:

*''[[interest rate]]''. When rates move higher, the bond part of a convertible bond tends to move lower, but the call option part of a convertible bond moves higher (and the aggregate tends to move lower).
*''stock price''. When the price of the stock the bond is convertible into moves higher, the price of the bond tends to rise.
*''[[credit spread (bond)|credit spread]]''. If the creditworthiness of the issuer deteriorates (e.g. [[credit rating agency|rating]] downgrade) and its credit spread widens, the bond price tends to move lower, but, in many cases, the call option part of the convertible bond moves higher (since credit spread correlates with volatility).

Given the complexity of the calculations involved and the convoluted structure that a convertible bond can have, an arbitrageur often relies on sophisticated quantitative models in order to identify bonds that are trading cheap versus their theoretical value.

[[Convertible arbitrage]] consists of buying a convertible bond and hedging two of the three factors in order to gain exposure to the third factor at a very attractive price.

For instance an arbitrageur would first buy a convertible bond, then sell [[fixed income]] [[Security (finance)|securities]] or [[interest rate future]]s (to hedge the interest rate exposure) and buy some [[credit default swap|credit protection]] (to hedge the risk of credit deterioration).
Eventually what he'd be left with is something similar to a call option on the underlying stock, acquired at a very low price.
He could then make money either selling some of the more expensive options that are openly traded in the market or [[delta hedging]] his exposure to the underlying shares.

===Depository receipts===
A [[depositary receipt]] is a security that is offered as a "tracking stock" on another foreign market. For instance, a [[China|Chinese]] company wishing to raise more money may issue a depository receipt on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], as the amount of capital on the local exchanges is limited. These securities, known as ADRs ([[American depositary receipt]]) or GDRs ([[global depository receipt]]) depending on where they are issued, are typically considered "foreign" and therefore trade at a lower value when first released. Many ADR's are exchangeable into the original security (known as [[fungibility]]) and actually have the same value. In this case there is a spread between the perceived value and real value, which can be extracted. Other ADR's that are not exchangeable often have much larger spreads. Since the ADR is trading at a value lower than what it is worth, one can purchase the ADR and expect to make money as its value converges on the original. However, there is a chance that the original stock will fall in value too, so by shorting it one can hedge that risk.

===Cross-border arbitrage===
Cross-border arbitrage exploits different prices of the same stock in different countries:

Example: [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] is trading on [[NASDAQ]] at US$108.84. The stock is also traded on the German electronic exchange, [[Xetra (trading system)|XETRA]]. If 1 euro costs US$1.11, a cross-border trader could enter a buy order on the XETRA at €98.03 per Apple share and a sell order at €98.07 per share.

Some brokers in Germany do not offer access to the U.S. exchanges. Hence if a German retail investor wants to buy Apple stock, he needs to buy it on the XETRA. The cross-border trader would sell the Apple shares on XETRA to the investor and buy the shares in the same second on NASDAQ. Afterwards, the cross-border trader would need to transfer the shares bought on NASDAQ to the German XETRA exchange, where he is obliged to deliver the stock.

In most cases, the quotation on the local exchanges is done electronically by [[High-frequency trading|high-frequency traders]], taking into consideration the home price of the stock and the [[exchange rate]]. This kind of high-frequency trading benefits the public as it reduces the cost to the German investor and enables him to buy U.S. shares.

===Dual-listed companies===
A [[dual-listed company]] (DLC) structure involves two companies incorporated in different countries contractually agreeing to operate their businesses as if they were a single enterprise, while retaining their separate legal identity and existing stock exchange listings. In integrated and efficient financial markets, stock prices of the twin pair should move in lockstep. In practice, DLC share prices exhibit large deviations from theoretical parity. Arbitrage positions in DLCs can be set up by obtaining a long position in the relatively underpriced part of the DLC and a short position in the relatively overpriced part. Such arbitrage strategies start paying off as soon as the relative prices of the two DLC stocks converge toward theoretical parity. However, since there is no identifiable date at which DLC prices will converge, arbitrage positions sometimes have to be kept open for considerable periods of time. In the meantime, the price gap might widen. In these situations, arbitrageurs may receive [[margin call]]s, after which they would most likely be forced to liquidate part of the position at a highly unfavorable moment and suffer a loss. Arbitrage in DLCs may be profitable, but is also very risky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Jong|first1=A.|first2=L.|last2=Rosenthal|first3=M.A.|last3=van Dijk|date=June 2008|title=The Risk and Return of Arbitrage in Dual-Listed Companies|ssrn=525282|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathijsavandijk.com/dual-listed-companies/ |author=Mathijs A. van Dijk |title=Dual-listed Companies |accessdate=January 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good illustration of the risk of DLC arbitrage is the position in [[Royal Dutch Shell]]—which had a DLC structure until 2005—by the hedge fund [[Long-Term Capital Management]] (LTCM, see also the discussion below). Lowenstein (2000) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowenstein|first1=R.|year=2000|title=When genius failed: The rise and fall of Long-Term Capital Management|publisher=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes that LTCM established an arbitrage position in Royal Dutch Shell in the summer of 1997, when Royal Dutch traded at an 8 to 10 percent premium. In total, $2.3 billion was invested, half of which was long in Shell and the other half was short in Royal Dutch (Lowenstein, p.&amp;nbsp;99). In the autumn of 1998, large defaults on Russian debt created significant losses for the hedge fund and LTCM had to unwind several positions. Lowenstein reports that the premium of Royal Dutch had increased to about 22 percent and LTCM had to close the position and incur a loss. According to Lowenstein (p.&amp;nbsp;234), LTCM lost $286 million in equity [[pairs trading]] and more than half of this loss is accounted for by the [[Royal Dutch Shell]] trade.

===Private to public equities===
The market prices for privately held companies are typically viewed from a return on investment perspective (such as 25%), whilst publicly held and or exchange listed companies trade on a [[Price to earnings ratio]] (P/E) (such as a P/E of 10, which equates to a 10% [[Return on investment|ROI]]). Thus, if a publicly traded company specialises in the acquisition of privately held companies, from a per-share perspective there is a gain with every acquisition that falls within these guidelines. E.g., [[Berkshire Hathaway]] and [[Halydean Corporation]]. Private to public equities arbitrage is a term which can arguably be applied to [[investment banking]] in general.  Private markets to public markets differences may also help explain the overnight windfall gains enjoyed by principals of companies that just did an [[initial public offering]] (IPO).

===Regulatory arbitrage===
{{details|Jurisdictional arbitrage}}
Regulatory arbitrage is where a regulated institution takes advantage of the difference between its real (or economic) [[risk]] and the regulatory position. For example, if a bank, operating under the [[Basel I]] accord, has to hold 8% capital against [[default risk]], but the real risk of default is lower, it is profitable to [[Securitization|securitise]] the loan, removing the low risk loan from its portfolio. On the other hand, if the real risk is higher than the regulatory risk then it is profitable to make that loan and hold on to it, provided it is priced appropriately. Regulatory arbitrage can result in parts of entire businesses being unregulated as a result of the arbitrage.

This process can increase the overall riskiness of institutions under a risk insensitive regulatory regime, as described by [[Alan Greenspan]] in his October 1998 speech on [http://www.ny.frb.org/research/epr/98v04n3/9810gree.pdf The Role of Capital in Optimal Banking Supervision and Regulation].

The term "Regulatory Arbitrage" was used for the first time in 2005 when it was applied by Scott V. Simpson, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, to refer to a new defence tactic in hostile mergers and acquisitions where differing takeover regimes in deals involving multi-jurisdictions are exploited to the advantage of a target company under threat.

In economics, regulatory arbitrage (sometimes, tax arbitrage) may be used to refer to situations when a company can choose a nominal place of business with a regulatory, legal or tax regime with lower costs. For example, an [[insurance]] company may choose to locate in [[Bermuda]] due to preferential tax rates and policies for insurance companies. This can occur particularly where the business transaction has no obvious physical location. In the case of many financial products, it may be unclear "where" the transaction occurs.

Regulatory arbitrage can include restructuring a bank by outsourcing services such as IT. The outsourcing company takes over the installations, buying out the bank's assets and charges a periodic service fee back to the bank. This frees up cashflow usable for new lending by the bank. The bank will have higher IT costs, but counts on the multiplier effect of [[money creation]] and the interest rate spread to make it a profitable exercise.

Example:
Suppose the bank sells its IT installations for 40 million USD. With a reserve ratio of 10%, the bank can create 400 million USD in additional loans (there is a time lag, and the bank has to expect to recover the loaned money back into its books). The bank can often lend (and securitize the loan) to the IT services company to cover the acquisition cost of the IT installations. This can be at preferential rates, as the sole client using the IT installation is the bank. If the bank can generate 5% interest margin on the 400 million of new loans, the bank will increase interest revenues by 20 million. The IT services company is free to leverage their balance sheet as aggressively as they and their banker agree to. This is the reason behind the trend towards outsourcing in the financial sector. Without this money creation benefit, it is actually more expensive to outsource the IT operations as the outsourcing adds a layer of management and increases overhead.

According to PBS Frontline's 2012 four-part documentary, "Money, Power, and Wall Street," regulatory arbitrage, along with asymmetric bank lobbying in Washington and abroad, allowed investment banks in the pre- and post-2008 period to continue to skirt laws and engage in the risky proprietary trading of opaque derivatives, swaps, and other credit-based instruments invented to circumvent legal restrictions at the expense of clients, government, and publics.

Due to the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid coverage, one form of Regulatory Arbitrage can now be found when businesses engage in “Medicaid Migration”, a maneuver by which qualifying employees who would typically be enrolled in company health plans elect to enroll in Medicaid instead. These programs that have similar characteristics as insurance products to the employee, but have radically different cost structures, resulting in significant expense reductions for employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What is Medicaid migration and how does it apply to brokers?|date=June 25, 2014|url=http://www.benefitnews.com/blog/beadvised/what-is-medicaid-migration-and-how-does-it-apply-to-brokers-2742350-1.html|work=Employee Benefit News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telecom arbitrage===
{{main|International telecommunications routes}}

Telecom arbitrage companies allow phone users to make international calls for free through certain access numbers. Such services are offered in the United Kingdom; the telecommunication arbitrage companies get paid an interconnect charge by the UK mobile networks and then buy international routes at a lower cost. The calls are seen as free by the UK contract mobile phone customers since they are using up their allocated monthly minutes rather than paying for additional calls.

Such services were previously offered in the United States by companies such as FuturePhone.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2560255|accessdate=2008-12-23|title=Free International Calls! Just Dial ... Iowa|date=2006-10-13|author=Ned Potter}}&lt;/ref&gt; These services would operate in rural telephone exchanges, primarily in small towns in the state of Iowa. In these areas, the local telephone carriers are allowed to charge a high "termination fee" to the caller's carrier in order to fund the cost of providing service to the small and sparsely populated areas that they serve. However, FuturePhone (as well as other similar services) ceased operations upon legal challenges from AT&amp;T and other service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techdirt.com/articles/20070207/123022.shtml|accessdate=2008-12-23|title=Phone Call Arbitrage Is All Fun And Games (And Profit) Until AT&amp;T Hits You With A $2 Million Lawsuit|date=2007-02-07|author=Mike Masnick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical arbitrage===
{{main|Statistical arbitrage}}
[[Statistical arbitrage]] is an imbalance in expected nominal values.&lt;ref name=DamghaniCointelation /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Babak |last=Mahdavi Damghani |year=2013|title= De-arbitraging With a Weak Smile: Application to Skew Risk |journal=[[Wilmott]] |volume=2013 |issue=1 |pages=40–49 |doi= 10.1002/wilm.10201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[casino]] has a statistical arbitrage in every game of chance that it offers—referred to as the [[house advantage]], house edge, [[vigorish]] or house vigorish.

==The fall of Long-Term Capital Management==
{{main|Long-Term Capital Management}}

[[Long-Term Capital Management]] (LTCM) lost 4.6 billion U.S. dollars in [[fixed income arbitrage]] in September 1998. LTCM had attempted to make money on the price difference between different [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]. For example, it would sell [[United States Treasury security|U.S. Treasury securities]] and buy Italian bond futures. The concept was that because Italian bond futures had a less liquid market, in the short term Italian bond futures would have a higher return than U.S. bonds, but in the long term, the prices would converge. Because the difference was small, a large amount of money had to be borrowed to make the buying and selling profitable.

The downfall in this system began on August 17, 1998, when [[Russia]] defaulted on its [[Russian ruble|ruble]] debt and domestic dollar debt. Because the markets were already nervous due to the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], investors began selling non-U.S. treasury  debt and buying U.S. treasuries, which were considered a safe investment. As a result, the price on US treasuries began to increase and the return began decreasing because there were many buyers, and the return (yield) on other bonds began to increase because there were many sellers (i.e. the price of those bonds fell). This caused the difference between the prices of U.S. treasuries and other bonds to increase, rather than to decrease as LTCM was expecting. Eventually this caused LTCM to fold, and their creditors had to arrange a bail-out. More controversially, officials of the [[Federal Reserve]] assisted in the negotiations that led to this bail-out, on the grounds that so many companies and deals were intertwined with LTCM that if LTCM actually failed, they would as well, causing a collapse in confidence in the economic system. Thus LTCM failed as a fixed income arbitrage fund, although it is unclear what sort of profit was realized by the banks that bailed LTCM out.

'''Birgitta Karlström Dorph''' (born 5{{nbsp}}June 1939) is a Swedish diplomat. She is mostly known for her clandestine work in channeling funds from the Swedish government to the [[Internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid movement]] in South Africa during the 1980s.

== Early life and education ==
Märta Birgitta Karlström Dorph grew up in [[Karlstad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johansson|first1=Sven L-O|title=Karlstadstösen som blev diplomat i Afrika|trans-title=The gal from Karlstad who became diplomat in Africa|url=http://www.vf.se/nyheter/allman/karlstadstosen-som-blev-diplomat-i-afrika|website=www.vf.se|date=13 August 2013|publisher=[[Värmlands Folkblad]]|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she went to the [[Tingvallagymnasiet]]. After graduating she studied in the United States, attended the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] and worked in France. She finally entered an education at the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs]] where she remained and worked as a diplomat for 44 years.&lt;ref name=svt1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karlsson|first1=Inger|title=Hon var "Palmes hemliga agent"|trans-title=She was Palme's secret agent|url=http://www.svt.se/nyheter/regionalt/varmland/hon-var-palmes-hemliga-agent|website=www.svt.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
During twenty of Karlström Dorph's years within the diplomatic corps she worked in Africa where she was stationed in [[Addis Ababa]], Ethiopia and [[Gaborone]], Botswana, among other places. In 1982–88, she worked in [[Pretoria]], South Africa.&lt;ref name=svt1 /&gt;

== Secret mission ==
While stationed as second in command at the [[List of diplomatic missions of Sweden|Swedish legation]]{{efn|At the time the Swedish embassy in South Africa was called a "legation".&lt;ref name=NAI /&gt;}} in Pretoria and working as a diplomat,&lt;ref name=expressen1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Claes|title=Hon var Palmes hemliga agent|trans-title=She was Palme's secret agent|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/hon-var-palmes-hemliga-agent/|website=www.expressen.se|date=24 September 2015|publisher=[[Expressen]]|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; she also had a secret mission. Her job was to get in contact with the leaders of the then prohibited anti-apartheid movement in South Africa and Namibia,&lt;ref name=NAI&gt;{{cite web|title=Birgitta Karlström-Dorph|url=http://www.liberationafrica.se/intervstories/interviews/karlstrom-dorph/?by-name=1|website=www.liberationafrica.se|publisher=[[Nordic Africa Institute]]|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and find ways to transfer money from Sweden to support their cause.&lt;ref name=svt1 /&gt; The operation was initiated by [[Olof Palme]] and the Swedish government. These arrangements were clandestine and were not discussed in public in the [[Riksdag]]. A total sum of about SEK 1.6 billion ($200 million)&lt;ref name=expressen1 /&gt; were transferred to the [[African National Congress]] and other organizations.&lt;ref name=svt1 /&gt; Karlström Dorph established a contact net of recipients and ways to transfer the money. Information about the transfers were sent as [[Encryption|encrypted]] [[Telegraphy|telegrams]], by couriers or as hidden messages in gifts.&lt;ref name=expressen1 /&gt; The money came mainly from the humanitarian [[Government agencies in Sweden|government agency]] [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (SIDA) but could not be channeled directly since officially, Sweden was not giving any aid to South Africa.&lt;ref name=NAI /&gt;

A significant part of the money was used for legal help in defending black persons accused of breaking any of the [[Apartheid legislation|apartheid laws]] that were in effect at the time. This help led to a number of people escaping the death penalty, or had their jail sentences drastically reduced. Money also went to churches, newspapers, unions and women's organizations and the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]].&lt;ref name=expressen1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22457">The '''Brander–Spencer model''' is an [[economics|economic]] model in [[international trade]] originally developed by [[James Brander]] and [[Barbara Spencer]] in the early 1980s. The model illustrates a situation where, under certain assumptions, a government can subsidize domestic firms to help them in their competition against foreign producers and in doing so enhances national welfare. This conclusion stands in contrast to results from most international trade models, in which government non-interference is socially optimal.

The basic model is a variation on the [[Stackelberg competition|Stackelberg]]–[[Cournot competition|Cournot]] "leader and follower" [[duopoly]] game. Alternatively, the model can be portrayed in [[game theory|game theoretic]] terms as initially a game with multiple [[Nash equilibria]], with government having the capability of affecting the payoffs to switch to a game with just one equilibrium.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt; Although it is possible for the national government to increase a country's welfare in the model through export subsidies, the policy is of [[beggar thy neighbor]] type.&lt;ref name=chl&gt;Cohen and Lipson, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; This also means that if all governments simultaneously attempt to follow the policy prescription of the model, all countries would wind up worse off.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt;

The model was part of the "[[New Trade Theory]]" that was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which incorporated then recent developments from literature on [[industrial organization]] into theories of international trade. In particular, like in many other New Trade Theory models, [[economies of scale]] (in this case, in the form of fixed entry costs) play an important role in the Brander–Spencer model.&lt;ref name=krugman&gt;Krugman, pp. 235–236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entry game version==

A simplified version of the model was popularized by [[Paul Krugman]] in the 1990s in his book ''[[Peddling Prosperity]]''. In this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, it will make a profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt;

1D = Stay Out      |DL = 0, 50      |DR = 0, 0     |
URc =#AA4466 }}
|-
|}

The available choices of the domestic firms are given on the left, while those of the foreign firm are on top. The first number in each cell denotes the payoff to the domestic firm while the second number is the payoff to the foreign firm.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt;

The game with no government subsidy to the domestic firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both stay out of the market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two [[Nash equilibrium|Nash equilibria]] of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;If firms choose "[[Mixed strategies#Mixed strategy|mixed strategies]]" – that is, they choose a probability with which to enter or not – then both firms may end up erroneously entering the market. According to Krugman, that kind of situation occurred in the 1970s with both [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]] both simultaneously entering the market for three engine [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body jets]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt;

The game changes however if the government credibly promises to subsidize the domestic firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2. Suppose the government promises a subsidy of twenty million, regardless of whether the foreign firm also enters or not. In that case, if the foreign firm enters the domestic firm will lose ten million from entry costs but will be more than compensated by the government subsidy, ending up with a net payoff of ten million. If the foreign firm does not enter of course, it is still profitable for the domestic firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the foreign firm, the domestic firm's incentive is to enter the market. Anticipating this, the foreign firm will stay out of the market itself, since otherwise it would incur a loss.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt;

From the point of view of the domestic country, the subsidy is welfare improving. The 20 million subsidy is a transfer from the government to the firm hence it has no effect on national welfare (ignoring [[deadweight loss|costs of taxation]]; as long as these are not too large the basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.

==Stackelberg–Cournot version==

{{See also|Cournot game|Stackelberg game}}
The original Brander and Spencer paper presented the game in the framework of a Cournot competition model.

Letting x denote the output of the domestic firm and y denote the output of the foreign firm, the [[inverse demand function]] (price as a function of total quantity) is given by &lt;math&gt;p(x+y)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the profit function for the domestic firm is &lt;math&gt;\pi^h=xp(x+y)-c(x)+sx&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;xp(x+y)&lt;/math&gt; is total revenue, &lt;math&gt;c(x)&lt;/math&gt; is total cost of producing x units, and s is per unit subsidy provided by the government. The profit function for the foreign firm is similar except that it does not include a subsidy, &lt;math&gt;\pi^f=yp(x+y)-c(y)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=bns&gt;J. Brander and B. Spencer, [http://strategy.sauder.ubc.ca/spencer/1985JIE-ExportSubsidies.pdf "Export Subsidies and International Market Share Rivalry"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211101/http://strategy.sauder.ubc.ca/spencer/1985JIE-ExportSubsidies.pdf# |date=2011-07-06 }}, ''Journal of International Economics'', 18, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Each firm chooses the quantity to supply in order to maximize profits, taking the other's choice as given. The (first order) conditions for profit maximization are &lt;math&gt;xp_x+p-c_x+s=0&lt;/math&gt; for the domestic firm and &lt;math&gt;yp_{y}+p-c_{y}=0&lt;/math&gt; for the foreign firm, where subscripted variables denote [[partial derivative]]s. Solving these for y implicitly defines a [[best response function]] for each firm; &lt;math&gt;y=R1(x;s)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=R2(x)&lt;/math&gt;. These are illustrated in the figure below, with the domestic firm's output on the x axis and foreign firm's output on the y axis.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Additional mathematical assumptions on the inverse demand function and the cost functions are needed to ensure that the above conditions define a maximum and that the reaction functions slope downward (choices are "[[strategic substitutes]]") and that they cross. The graph illustrates the case of linear demand of the form &lt;math&gt;p=a-b(x+y)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bns/&gt;

[[File:Brender spencer.JPG|center]]

With no government subsidy (s=0) the resulting equilibrium will be the standard Cournot outcome, as shown in the graph by the intersection of the best response functions. A subsidy however has the effect of shifting the domestic firm's best response function to the right. Because its output is subsidized, the domestic firm increases production. This in turn means that the foreign firm's best response is to cut output, although not proportionally (hence, the market price falls). In the new equilibrium domestic firm produces more and foreign firm produces less.&lt;ref name=bns/&gt;&lt;ref name=cns&gt;Cohen and Lipson, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

In the model, domestic social welfare can be defined as the home firm's profit net of the subsidy (the model can be extended so that social welfare includes the firm's monopoly profit as well as the wages paid to the firm's workers; the results are qualitatively the same). It can be shown that the profit function evaluated at equilibrium quantity levels is concave in s and eventually negatively sloped. As a result, there is an "optimal subsidy" which maximizes the domestic firm's profits and hence domestic social welfare. As it turns out, if the government sets the subsidy exactly at the optimal level, the resulting equilibrium is the same as that of the "leader and follower" Stackelberg model. In that case one of the firms (in this case the domestic firm) has the ability to choose its output first. This creates the ability to credibly commit to a particular action, resulting in "first mover advantage". In the Brender–Spencer model, the government's subsidy creates this credible commitment even when the private firm does not have that ability.&lt;ref name=bns/&gt;

==Extensions==

===Domestic consumption of export good===

In standard models of international trade a fall in the price of a country's [[export good]] – a deterioration in its [[terms of trade]] – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party [[arbitrage]]) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether [[marginal cost]]s of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need on the part of the government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.&lt;ref name=bns/&gt;

In the more general case where the firm cannot [[price discrimination|price discriminate]] between domestic and foreign consumers the effects of a subsidy are less clear since both an expansion of exports and deterioration of terms of trade are present. However, Brender and Spencer show that starting out from the position of no subsidy, introducing a small subsidy can improve a country's welfare.&lt;ref name=bns/&gt;

===Extended government game===
The basic model can be extended to incorporate a supra-game played by the governments of the respective countries. In this case, each government chooses the level of subsidy it will provide to its firm, taking the other government's action as given, and [[backward induction|anticipating the reaction]] of the firms (in terms of quantity produced) to the subsidy. Brander and Spencer show that in the resulting Nash equilibrium the governments choose a level of subsidy that is too high and hence they do not manage to maximize social welfare. In fact, if the good produced is not consumed domestically, then the optimal level of subsidy is negative – an export tax.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Brander and Spencer assume a domestic [[utility function]] of the [[Quasilinear utility|quasilinear]] form, &lt;math&gt;u(x,m)=m+U(x)&lt;/math&gt;, where m is a competitively produced [[numéraire good]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the total quantity produced in the Cournot and the Stackelberg equilibrium is higher than the profit maximizing collusive monopoly level of output. Since both the home and foreign firm are producing for a third market, an export tax could reduce the total quantity produced down to the monopoly level, thus increasing both firms' profits. In that way the governments can effect a collusive outcome between their firms, at the expanse of the third country which imports the good.&lt;ref name=bns/&gt;

==Policy applications and applied work==

===General difficulties===

[[File:Paul Krugman-press conference Dec 07th, 2008-8.jpg|thumb|200px|Paul Krugman popularized the model, but was also critical of it being misapplied to industries which did not meet the model's criteria.]]

As pointed out by Paul Krugman, the Brander–Spencer model, due to the sensitivity of the results to its assumptions, does not establish a generally applicable policy prescription in favor of government subsidies. Rather, it provides an example for when such intervention may be justifiable and points to some conditions which may favor it.&lt;ref name=krugman241&gt;Krugman, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

A general difficulty with the application of the model, like many game theoretic models, is that it does not easily lend itself to [[econometrics|econometric]] testing and parameter estimation. As a result, the two avenues of empirical research that have been pursued in subsequent literature have been estimates of a "[[conjectural variation]]" parameter for particular industries, and calibration of the models using behavioral parameters from other studies. The former approach assumes that firms have a "conjecture" as to how the other firms will react to their own choice of output and base their decision on this belief. However, the approach is problematic, both from an analytical (it is not internally consistent) and an empirical point of view (there's no guarantee that the parameter, even if it makes conceptual sense, remains stable when a new policy – the government's subsidy – is introduced&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is the same argument as that of the [[Lucas critique]] but in a specific [[microeconomic]] setting&lt;/ref&gt;). Calibrations of models of industry structure on the other hand have generally found that most industry are neither Cournot (in which case the Brander–Spencer policy prescription would be an export subsidy) nor Bertrand (in which case the optimal policy is an export tax). As a result, it is hard to say in which industries exactly the Brander–Spencer policy prescription may apply.&lt;ref name=kns&gt;Krugman and Smith, pgs. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
Marie Thursby has used an extended version of the model to examine international trade in wheat, 60% of which is produced by the United States and Canada. Thursby includes [[marketing board]]s, possibility of a [[monopsony]], and a variety of government policies in the analysis. She finds that while there are significant economies of scale in the industry, the barriers to entry are not high and regardless of the extent of market power that US firms have in the industry, the optimal policy is actually an export tax, rather than a subsidy.&lt;ref name=baldwin&gt;Baldwin, pp. 98–101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aircraft===
In his book which presented the model to the general public, Paul Krugman used the example of the aircraft industry, with the two players being [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing]].&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt; In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft in the context of the model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on [[price elasticity of demand]]; for relatively inelastic demand the net effect of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to [[consumer surplus]] resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, pp. 45–78 and table 3.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Gernot Klepper, in an analysis similar to Krugman and Baldwin, has also used the Brander Spencer and other models to analyze the effects of entry into the transport aircraft industry. He included the effects of [[learning by doing|learning]] during the production process which depends on the scale of production. His calibrated model suggested that per unit production costs can fall by as much as 20% if total production is doubled. In that case, the entry of another firm (in this case, Airbus) into the market would decrease per firm output and reduce the learning and scale effects. In his analysis, the entry of Airbus would cause an increase in consumer surplus, but this would be smaller than the resulting loss in producer surplus.&lt;ref name=cepr&gt;CEPR, bulletin.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

In general, like with many of the New Trade Theory models, the results of the Brander Spencer model and the policy prescriptions it generates are very sensitive to the underlying assumptions on the nature of the industry in question, the information available to the national government, its ability to credibly commit to an action and the likely response of foreign governments. Some of these criticisms were already noted by Brander and Spencer in their paper, where they advised caution.&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt;&lt;ref name=bns/&gt;

Further work on the model has shown that a slight difference in assumptions can produce completely different results. For example, Eaton and Grossmann showed that if the firms compete in prices rather in quantities ([[Bertrand competition]] rather than Cournot) then the optimal policy is an export tax rather a subsidy – a policy rarely used in practice, politically unpopular and contrary to protectionist sentiment which generally touted New Trade Theory models as an argument for their favored policies.&lt;ref name=cnl53&gt;Cohen and Lipson, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kns3&gt;Krugman and Smith, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The 1985 paper "Export Subsidies and International Market Share Rivalry", which presented the original version of the model, was the most cited paper in the ''[[Journal of International Economics]]'' since the inception of the journal in 1971 (as of 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Feenstra and Andy Rose: ''Journal of International Economics at Fifty: A Retrospective''. In: ''Journal of International Economics''. vol. 50, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civil disobedience''' is the active, professed refusal of a [[citizenship|citizen]] to obey certain [[law]]s, demands, orders or commands of a [[government]] or occupying international power. Civil disobedience is sometimes defined as having to be [[nonviolent]] to be called civil disobedience. Civil disobedience is sometimes, therefore, equated with [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Violent Civil Disobedience and Willingness to Accept Punishment|volume=8|issue=2|date=June 2007|publisher=Essays in Philosophy|url=http://commons.pacificu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1277&amp;context=eip}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The justifiability of violent civil disobedience|author=John Morreall|pages=35–47|year=1976|issue=1|volume=6|journal=Canadian Journal of Philosophy|jstor=40230600}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although civil disobedience is considered to be an expression of contempt for law, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] regarded civil disobedience to be a display and practice of reverence for law; for as "Any man who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and willingly accepts the penalty by staying in jail in order to arouse the conscience of the community on the injustice of the law is at that moment expressing the very highest respect for law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=Ned|title=Meet The Press: Martin Luther King, Jr. on the Selma March|url=https://archives.nbclearn.com/portal/site/k-12/flatview?cuecard=48756|website=NBC Learn|publisher=NBCUniversal Media|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Overview==
Its earliest successful implementation was brought about during the lead up to the nonviolent [[Glorious Revolution]] in Britain, when the [[1689 Bill of Rights]] was documented, the last Catholic monarch was deposed, and male and female joint-co-monarchs were elevated.  The [[Midlands Enlightenment|English Midland Enlightenment]] had developed a manner of voicing objection to a law viewed as illegitimate and then taking the consequences of the law.  This was focused on the illegitimacy of laws claimed to be "divine" in origin, including the "divine rights of Kings" and the "divine rights of man", and the legitimacy of laws acknowledged to be made by human beings.

It later became an effective tool by various peoples who objected to British occupation, such as in [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|the 1919 Revolution]], however, this was never used with native laws that were more oppressive than the British occupation, leading to problems for these countries today.&lt;ref name="Egypt"&gt;{{Citation|title=Nonviolent Social Movements: A Geographical Perspective|author=Zunes, Stephen (1999:42)|publisher=Blackwell Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Saad Zaghloul|Zaghloul Pasha]], considered the mastermind behind this massive civil disobedience, was a native middle-class, [[Al-Azhar University|Azhar]] graduate, political activist, judge, parliamentary and ex-cabinet minister whose leadership brought Christian and Muslim communities together as well as women into the massive protests. Along with his companions of [[Wafd Party]], who started campaigning in 1914, they have achieved independence of Egypt and a first constitution in 1923.

Civil disobedience is one of the many ways people have rebelled against what they deem to be unfair laws. It has been used in many [[nonviolent resistance]] movements in [[British Raj|India]] ([[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s campaigns for [[Indian independence movement|independence]] from the [[British Empire]]), in [[Czechoslovakia]]'s [[Velvet Revolution]], in early stages of Bangladesh independence movement against Pakistani repression and in [[East Germany]] to oust their [[communist]] governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tikkun reader|author=Michael Lerner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Africa]] in the fight against [[apartheid]], in the [[American civil rights movement]], in the [[Singing Revolution]] to bring independence to the [[Baltic countries]] from the [[Soviet Union]], recently with the 2003 [[Rose Revolution]] in Georgia and the 2004 [[Orange Revolution]]&lt;ref name="The Orange Revolution"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/041206/story.html |title=The Orange Revolution |publisher=Time Magazine |date=12 December 2004 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410051430/http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/041206/story.html |archivedate=April 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Ukraine, among other various movements worldwide.

One of the oldest depictions of civil disobedience is in [[Sophocles]]' play ''[[Antigone (Sophocles play)|Antigone]]'', in which [[Antigone]], one of the daughters of former King of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]], [[Oedipus]], defies [[Creon]], the current King of Thebes, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother [[Polynices]] a proper burial.  She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law.  She is not at all afraid of the death he threatens her with (and eventually carries out), but she is afraid of how her conscience will smite her if she does not do this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31/31-h/31-h.htm#antigone Sophocle's ''Antigone''], Project Gutenberg, F. Storr translation, 1912, Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Peterloo massacre]] of 1819, the poet [[Percy Shelley]] wrote the political poem ''[[The Mask of Anarchy]]'' later that year, that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time—and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of [[social action]]. According to [[Ashton Nichols]], it is perhaps the first [[modern history|modern]] statement of the principle of nonviolent protest.&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;[http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105232938/http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf|date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version was taken up by the author [[Henry David Thoreau]] in his essay [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|''Civil Disobedience'']], and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of ''[[Satyagraha]]''.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt; Gandhi's Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Weber, ''Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley's ''Masque of Anarchy'' to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.&lt;ref name=AFP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoreau's 1849 essay ''Civil Disobedience'', originally titled "Resistance to Civil Government", has had a wide influence on many later practitioners of civil disobedience. The driving idea behind the essay is that citizens are morally responsible for their support of aggressors, even when such support is required by law. In the essay, Thoreau explained his reasons for having [[tax resistance|refused to pay taxes]] as an act of [[protest]] against [[slavery]] and against the [[Mexican–American War]]. He writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man's shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency is tolerated. I have heard some of my townsmen say, "I should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves, or to march to Mexico;—see if I would go;" and yet these very men have each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by their money, furnished a substitute.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the 1850s, a range of minority groups in the [[United States]]: Blacks, Jews, Seventh Day Baptists, Catholics, anti-prohibitionists, racial egalitarians, and others—employed civil disobedience to combat a range of legal measures and public practices that to them promoted ethnic, religious, and [[racial discrimination]]. Pro Public and typically peaceful resistance to political power would remain an integral tactic in modern American [[minority rights]] politics.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, Kyle G. (2014).

== Etymology ==
[[File:Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|thumb|[[Henry David Thoreau]]'s classic essay ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'' inspired [[Martin Luther King]] and many other [[Activism|activists]].]]

[[Henry David Thoreau]]'s 1849 essay "Resistance to Civil Government" was eventually renamed "Essay on Civil Disobedience". After his landmark lectures were published in 1866, the term began to appear in numerous sermons and lectures relating to slavery and the war in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;The Gospel Applied to the Fugitive Slave Law [1850]: A Sermon, by [[mayur]] (1851)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Higher Law", in Its Application to the Fugitive Slave Bill:... by John Newell and [[John Chase Lord]] (1851)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Limits of Civil Disobedience: A Sermon..., by [[Nathaniel Hall]] (1851)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Duty and Limitations of Civil Disobedience: A Discourse, by [[Samuel Colcord Bartlett]] (1853)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, by the time Thoreau's lectures were first published under the title "Civil Disobedience", in 1866, four years after his death, the term had achieved fairly widespread usage.

It has been argued that the term "civil disobedience" has always suffered from ambiguity and in modern times, become utterly debased. Marshall Cohen notes, "It has been used to describe everything from bringing a test-case in the federal courts to [[taking aim at a federal official]]. Indeed, for [[Vice President of the United States|[US] Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew|[Spiro] Agnew]] it has become a code-word describing the activities of muggers, arsonists, draft evaders, campaign hecklers, campus militants, anti-war demonstrators, juvenile delinquents and political assassins."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Civil Disobedience in a Constitutional Democracy|author=Marshall Cohen|publisher=The Massachusetts Review|volume=10|issue=2|date=Spring 1969|pages=211–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LeGrande writes that
{{quote|the formulation of a single all-encompassing definition of the term is extremely difficult, if not impossible. In reviewing the voluminous literature on the subject, the student of civil disobedience rapidly finds himself surrounded by a maze of [[semantic]]al problems and grammatical niceties. Like [[Alice in Wonderland]], he often finds that specific terminology has no more (or no less) meaning than the individual orator intends it to have.}}
He encourages a distinction between lawful protest demonstration, nonviolent civil disobedience, and violent civil disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Northwestern University|doi=10.2307/1141639|title=Nonviolent Civil Disobedience and Police Enforcement Policy|author=J. L. LeGrande|volume=58|issue=3|date=Sep 1967|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science|pages=393–404|jstor=1141639|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5472&amp;context=jclc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to P.&amp;nbsp;K. Rao, dated September 10, 1935, Gandhi disputes that his idea of civil disobedience was derived from the writings of Thoreau:&lt;ref&gt;Letter to P.K. Rao, Servants of India Society, September 10, 1935, Letter quoted in Louis Fischer's, ''The Life of Mahatma Gandhi,'' Part I, Chapter 11, pp. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The statement that I had derived my idea of Civil Disobedience from the writings of Thoreau is wrong. The resistance to authority in South Africa was well advanced before I got the essay&amp;nbsp;... When I saw the title of Thoreau's great essay, I began to use his phrase to explain our struggle to the English readers. But I found that even "Civil Disobedience" failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase "Civil Resistance."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Theories ==
In seeking an active form of civil disobedience, one may choose to deliberately break certain laws, such as by forming a peaceful blockade or occupying a facility illegally,&lt;ref name="Right to Protest"&gt;{{Citation|title=Your Right To Protest|author=ACLU of Oregon|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though sometimes violence has been known to occur.  Often there is an expectation to be attacked or even beaten by the authorities. Protesters often undergo training in advance on how to react to arrest or to attack.

Civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws, as distinguished from a [[constitutional impasse]], in which two public agencies, especially two equally [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[branches of government]], conflict. For instance, if the [[head of government]] of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country's highest court, it would not be civil disobedience, since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen.&lt;ref name=Rex&gt;{{citation|title=Civil Disobedience|author=Rex Martin|publisher=Ethics|volume=80|issue=2|date=Jan 1970|pages=123–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this definition is disputed by Thoreau's political philosophy pitching the conscience vs. the collective. The individual is the final judge of right and wrong. More than this, since only individuals act, only individuals can act unjustly. When the government knocks on the door, it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood. Before Thoreau's imprisonment, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay, Thoreau had advised, "Resign." If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice. But if government is "the voice of the people," as it is often called, shouldn't that voice be heeded? Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians. Even a good form of government is "liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it." Moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said. The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right. What, then, is the proper relationship between the individual and the government?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McElroy|first1=Wendy|title=Henry Thoreau and 'Civil Disobedience'|url=http://thoreau.eserver.org/wendy.html|website=thoreau.eserver.org|publisher=Future of Freedom Foundation|accessdate=5 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918080939/http://thoreau.eserver.org/wendy.html|archivedate=18 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Dworkin]] held that there are three types of civil disobedience:
* "Integrity-based" civil disobedience occurs when a citizen disobeys a law she or he feels is immoral, as in the case of abolitionists disobeying the [[fugitive slave laws]] by refusing to turn over escaped slaves to authorities.
* "Justice-based" civil disobedience occurs when a citizen disobeys laws in order to lay claim to some right denied to her or him, as when blacks illegally protested during the [[civil rights movement]].
* "Policy-based" civil disobedience occurs when a person breaks the law in order to change a policy (s)he believes is dangerously wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Dworkin in Transition|author=Ken Kress and Scott W. Anderson|publisher=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=37|issue=2|date=Spring 1989|pages=337–351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities. Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as [[trade union]]s, [[bank]]s, and [[private universities]] can be justified if it reflects "a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken". The same principle, she argues, applies to breaches of law in protest against [[international organization]]s and foreign governments.&lt;ref name=Brownlee/&gt;

It is usually recognized that lawbreaking, if it is not done publicly, at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience. But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality, we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking. If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his [[natural right]]s, he might, for instance, find that assisting in [[fabricating evidence]] or committing [[perjury]] is more effective than open disobedience. This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on [[deceit]] in such situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.2307/1122838|title=Lawyering for Justice in a Flawed Democracy|first2=David|last2=Luban|author=Stephen Ellmann|publisher=Columbia Law Review|volume=90|issue=1|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=Jan 1990|pages=116–190|jstor=1122838}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fully Informed Jury Association]]'s publication "A Primer for Prospective Jurors" notes, "Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Gestapo|secret police]] demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://fija.org/docs/BR_2010_QandA_primer.pdf|title=A Primer for Prospective Jurors|publisher=Fully Informed Jury Association|access-date=28 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825163303/http://fija.org/docs/BR_2010_QandA_primer.pdf|archive-date=25 August 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this definition, civil disobedience could be traced back to the [[Book of Exodus]], where [[Shiphrah]] and [[Puah]] refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it. (Exodus 1: 15-19)&lt;ref&gt;Magonet, Jonathan (1992) Bible Lives (London: SCM), 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violent vs. non-violent===
There have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent. [[Black's Law Dictionary]] includes non-violence in its definition of civil disobedience. Christian Bay's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires "carefully chosen and legitimate means," but holds that they do not have to be non-violent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Bay, Christian|title=Civil Disobedience|publisher=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences|volume=II|pages=473–486}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that, while both civil disobedience and [[civil rebellion]] are justified by appeal to [[constitutional defect]]s, rebellion is much more destructive; therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience, and if one cannot justify civil rebellion, then one cannot justify a civil disobedients' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest. Civil disobedients' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society's tolerance of civil disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Civil Disobedience|author=Stuart M. Brown, Jr.|publisher=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=58|issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher H.&amp;nbsp;J. McCloskey argues that "if violent, intimidatory, coercive disobedience is more effective, it is, other things being equal, more justified than less effective, nonviolent disobedience."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.2307/2106847|title=Conscientious Disobedience of the Law: Its Necessity, Justification, and Problems to Which it Gives Rise|author=H.&amp;nbsp;J. McCloskey|publisher=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=40|issue=4|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=Jun 1980|pages=536–557|jstor=2106847}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his best-selling ''Disobedience and Democracy: Nine Fallacies on Law and Order'',&lt;ref&gt;Davis D. Joyce, ''Howard Zinn: A Radical American Vision'' (Prometheus, 2003), 102-103.  Joyce notes that ''Disobedience and Democracy'' sold 75,000 copies in the late 1960s and was Zinn's best-selling book prior to ''A People's History of the United States''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Zinn]] takes a similar position; Zinn states that while the goals of civil disobedience are generally non-violent,

{{quote|in the inevitable tension accompanying the transition from a violent world to a non-violent one, the choice of means will almost never be pure, and will involve such complexities that the simple distinction between violence and non-violence does not suffice as a guide ... the very acts with which we seek to do good cannot escape the imperfections of the world we are trying to change.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, ''Disobedience and Democracy: Nine Fallacies on Law and Order'' (South End Press edition, 2002), 39-41&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Zinn rejects any "easy and righteous dismissal of violence", noting that Thoreau, the popularizer of the term civil disobedience, approved of the armed insurrection of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. He also notes that some major civil disobedience campaigns which have been classified as non-violent, such as the [[Birmingham campaign]], have actually included elements of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, ''Disobedience'', 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="press.princeton.edu"&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7719.html Howard Zinn, "Introduction" for ''The Higher Law: Thoreau on Civil Disobedience and Reform,'' Wendell Glick, ed., (Princeton University Press, 2004)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401051906/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7719.html |date=2015-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolutionary vs. non-revolutionary===
Non-revolutionary civil disobedience is a simple disobedience of laws on the grounds that they are judged "wrong" by an individual conscience, or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal, or to exert pressure to get one's political wishes on some other issue. Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government (or to change cultural traditions, social customs, religious beliefs, etc...revolution doesn't have to be political, i.e. "cultural revolution", it simply implies sweeping and widespread change to a section of the social fabric).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Toward an Ethics of Civil Disobedience|author=Harry Prosch|publisher=Ethics|volume=77|issue=3|date=Apr 1967|pages=176–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's acts have been described as revolutionary civil disobedience.&lt;ref name=Rex/&gt; It has been claimed that the [[Hungarians]] under [[Ferenc Deák]] directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the [[Austrian government]].&lt;ref name=Bedau&gt;{{citation|doi=10.2307/2023542|publisher=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=58|issue=21|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=October 12, 1961|pages=653–665|title=On Civil Disobedience|author=Hugo A. Bedau|jstor=2023542}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau also wrote of civil disobedience accomplishing "peaceable revolution."&lt;ref name=Thoreau/&gt; Howard Zinn, [[Harvey Wheeler]], and others have identified the right espoused in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|US Declaration of Independence]] to "alter or abolish" an unjust government to be a principle of civil disobedience.&lt;ref name="press.princeton.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/hwheeler/constcivdisobed.htm#N_1_|title=Harvey Wheeler: The Constitutionality of Civil Disobedience|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective vs. solitary===
The earliest recorded incidents of collective civil disobedience took place during the [[Roman Empire]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Unarmed [[Jew]]s gathered in the streets to prevent the installation of pagan images in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}{{Original research inline|date=January 2012}} In modern times, some activists who commit civil disobedience as a group collectively refuse to sign [[bail (law)|bail]] until certain demands are met, such as favourable bail conditions, or the release of all the activists. This is a form of [[jail solidarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Path of Resistance|url=http://taghier.org/books/english/path_e.pdf|author=P Herngren|publisher=The Practice of Civil Disobedience|year=1993|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728081255/http://taghier.org/books/english/path_e.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2012}} There have also been many instances of solitary civil disobedience, such as that committed by Thoreau, but these sometimes go unnoticed. Thoreau, at the time of his arrest, was not yet a well-known author, and his arrest was not covered in any newspapers in the days, weeks and months after it happened. The tax collector who arrested him rose to higher political office, and Thoreau's essay was not published until after the end of the Mexican War.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Gross, Robert A.|title=Quiet War With The State; Henry David Thoreau and Civil Disobedience.|publisher=The Yale Review|date=October 2005|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
{{further|Examples of civil disobedience}}

===Choice of specific act===
Civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts. Hugo A. Bedau writes,
{{quote|There is a whole class of acts, undertaken in the name of civil disobedience, which, even if they were widely practiced, would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance (e.g. trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation)&amp;nbsp;... Such acts are often just a harassment and, at least to the bystander, somewhat inane&amp;nbsp;... The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity.}}
Bedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward [[public policy]] goals may serve a propaganda purpose.&lt;ref name="Bedau"/&gt; Some civil disobedients, such as the proprietors of illegal [[medical cannabis dispensaries]] and Voice in the Wilderness, which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the US government, directly achieve a desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) while openly breaking the law. [[Julia Butterfly Hill]] lived in [[Luna (Redwood Tree)|Luna]], a {{convert|180|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall, 600-year-old [[California Redwood]] tree for 738 days, successfully preventing it from being cut down.

In cases where the criminalized behaviour is [[pure speech]], civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech. An example would be [[WBAI]]'s broadcasting the track "[[Filthy Words]]" from a [[George Carlin]] comedy album, which eventually led to the 1978 Supreme Court case of ''[[FCC v. Pacifica Foundation]]''. [[Threatening government officials]] is another classic way of expressing defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies. For example, Joseph Haas was arrested for allegedly sending an email to the [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]], city councillors stating, "Wise up or die."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Brown+case+e-mails+investigated&amp;articleId=083dd586-0d54-4650-a9ca-07f99d4d3914|title=Brown case e-mails investigated|date=June 21, 2007|publisher=Union-Leader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, protesters of particular [[victimless crime]]s often see fit to openly commit that crime. Laws against [[public nudity]], for instance, have been [[nudity and protest|protested by going naked in public]], and laws against cannabis consumption have been protested by openly possessing it and using it at cannabis rallies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig8/clark-d5.html |title=Civil Disobedience and the Libertarian Division of Labor |author=Clark, Dick |date=April 22, 2008 |publisher=LewRockwell.com }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some forms of civil disobedience, such as [[illegal boycott]]s, [[refusals to pay taxes]], [[draft dodging]], [[denial-of-service attack|distributed denial-of-service attack]]s, and [[sit-in]]s, make it more difficult for a system to function. In this way, they might be considered coercive.  Brownlee notes that "although civil disobedients are constrained in their use of coercion by their conscientious aim to engage in moral dialogue, nevertheless they may find it necessary to employ limited coercion in order to get their issue onto the table."&lt;ref name=Brownlee&gt;{{citation|title=The communicative aspects of civil disobedience and lawful punishment|author=Kimberley Brownlee|date=9 November 2006|journal=Criminal Law and Philosophy|volume=1|doi=10.1007/s11572-006-9015-9|issue=2|page=179|publisher=Criminal Law and Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Plowshares]] organization temporarily closed [[GCSB Waihopai]] by padlocking the gates and using sickles to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes.

[[Electronic civil disobedience]] can include [[web site defacement]]s, [[URL redirection|redirect]]s, [[denial-of-service attack]]s, [[information theft]] and [[Internet leak|data leaks]], illegal web site [[parody|parodies]], [[virtual sit-in]]s, and [[virtual sabotage]]. It is distinct from other kinds of [[hacktivism]] in that the perpetrator openly reveals his identity. Virtual actions rarely succeed in completely shutting down their targets, but they often generate significant media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1177/0002716204270338|title=The New Digital Media and Activist Networking within Anti-Corporate Globalization Movements|author=Jeffrey S.

[[Dilemma action]]s are designed to create a "response dilemma" for public authorities "by forcing them to either concede some public space to protesters or make themselves look absurd or heavy-handed by acting against the protest."&lt;ref name=Moth&gt;Laura Moth, [[Today's Zaman]], 19 June 2013, [https://archive.is/20130620053234/http://www.todayszaman.com/blogNewsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=318666 A standing dilemma in Taksim ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Police officer speaking to demonstrator during civil disobedience action.jpg|thumb|right|A police officer speaks with a demonstrator at a union picket, explaining that she will be arrested if she does not leave the street. The demonstrator was arrested moments later.]]
Some disciplines of civil disobedience hold that the protestor must submit to arrest and cooperate with the authorities. Others advocate falling limp or [[resisting arrest]], especially when it will hinder the police from effectively responding to a mass protest.

Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases. For example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a [[consent search]] of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Watts v. Indiana]]'', {{ussc|338|49|1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=The Yale Law Journal|title=A Postscript to the Miranda Project: Interrogation of Draft Protestors|author=John Griffiths and Richard E. Ayres|volume=77|issue=2|date=Dec 1967|pages=300–319|doi=10.2307/795080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote,
{{quote|My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with—for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel—and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action.&lt;ref name=Thoreau&gt;Thoreau, Henry David. ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the [[social contract]], which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established, or else suffer the penalties set out in the law. Other civil disobedients who favour the existence of government still don't believe in the legitimacy of their particular government, or don't believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted. And still other civil disobedients, being anarchists, don't believe in the legitimacy of any government, and therefore see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others.

===Choice of plea===
An important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to [[plead guilty]]. There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://freestateproject.org/news/issues/civil_disobedience.php|title=Rules for Engaging in Civil Disobedience|publisher=Free State Project|access-date=17 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613110110/http://freestateproject.org/news/issues/civil_disobedience.php|archive-date=13 June 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. [[ACT UP]]'s Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, "Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged," but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, "Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty." A plea of [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.actupny.org/documents/CDdocuments/ACTUP_CivilDisobedience.pdf|title=Civil Disobedience Training|publisher=ACT UP|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; One defendant accused of illegally protesting [[nuclear power]], when asked to enter his plea, stated, "I plead for the beauty that surrounds us";&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Hurst, John|year=1978|title=A-plant protesters being freed|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is known as a "creative plea," and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty.&lt;ref name=NLG/&gt;

When the Committee for Non-Violent Action sponsored a protest in August 1957, at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas, Nevada, 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest. At a pre-arranged announced time, one at a time they stepped across the "line" and were immediately arrested. They were put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah, Nevada, and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace, that afternoon. A well known civil rights attorney, Francis Heisler, had volunteered to defend the arrested persons, advising them to plead ''[[nolo contendere]]'', as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not-guilty. The arrested persons were found guilty nevertheless and given suspended sentences, conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Howard Zinn writes,
{{quote|There may be many times when protesters ''choose'' to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice. But that is different than the notion that they ''must'' go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience. The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail, or by evading it. To accept jail penitently as an accession to "the rules" is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the protest&amp;nbsp;... In particular, the [[neo-conservative]] insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, ''Disobedience and Disorder: Nine Fallacies on Law and Order,'' cited in {{citation|title=On Civil Disobedience in Recent American Democratic Thought|author=Paul F. Power|publisher=The American Political Science Review|volume=64|issue=1|date=Mar 1970|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sometimes the prosecution proposes a [[plea bargain]] to civil disobedients, as in the case of the [[Camden 28]], in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanour count and receive no jail time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Mirelle Cohen|title=The Camden 28 (review)|journal=Teaching Sociology|volume=35|issue=4|date=Oct 2007|pages=391–392|doi=10.1177/0092055x0703500423}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[mass arrest]] situations, the activists decide to use [[solidarity]] tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone.&lt;ref name=NLG&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nlg-la.org/index_files/cd_questions.pdf|title=Questions and Answers about Civil Disobedience and the Legal Process|author=National Lawyers Guild, LA Chapter|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727003254/http://www.nlg-la.org/index_files/cd_questions.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But some activists have opted to enter a [[blind plea]], pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place. Mahatma Gandhi pleaded guilty and told the court, "I am here to&amp;nbsp;... submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Three Principles of Civil Disobedience: Thoreau, Gandhi, and King|publisher=Lewiston Morning Tribune|date=January 15, 2006|author=Nick Gier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choice of allocution===
Some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech, or a speech explaining their actions, in [[allocution]]. In ''U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar'', a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on US Navy property argued to the court in allocution that "the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy". As a result, the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days. This action was upheld because, according to the [[US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]], her statement suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|url=http://openjurist.org/275/f3d/23/united-states-of-america-v-norma-burgos-andjar|vol=275|reporter=F.3d|opinion=23|litigants=United States of America v. Norma Burgos-Andjar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prosario-2000.0catch.com/Politics/allocution.htm|title=Allocution|website=prosario-2000.0catch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim DeChristopher]] gave an allocution statement to the court describing the US as "a place where the rule of law was created through acts of civil disobedience" and arguing, "Since those bedrock acts of civil disobedience by our founding fathers, the rule of law in this country has continued to grow closer to our shared higher moral code through the civil disobedience that drew attention to legalized injustice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grist.org/climate-energy/2011-07-27-tim-dechristophers-statement-to-the-court/|title=Tim DeChristopher's statement to the court|date=28 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal implications of civil disobedience==
[[Steven Barkan]] writes that if defendants plead not guilty, "they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine, or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience." A [[technical defence]] may enhance the chances for acquittal, but increase the possibility of additional proceedings as well as reduced press coverage. During the [[Vietnam War]] era, the [[Chicago Eight]] used a [[political defence]], while [[Benjamin Spock trial|Benjamin Spock]] used a technical defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Strategic, Tactical and Organizational Dilemmas of the Protest Movement against Nuclear Power|author=Steven E. Barkan|authorlink=Steven Barkan|publisher=Social Problems|volume=27|issue=1|date=Oct 1979|pages=19–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries such as the United States, whose laws guarantee the right to a [[jury trial]] but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek [[jury nullification]]. Over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as ''[[Sparf v. United States]]'', which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative, and ''[[United States v. Dougherty]]'', which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification.

Governments have generally not recognized the legitimacy of civil disobedience or viewed political objectives as an excuse for breaking the law. Specifically, the law usually distinguishes between [[criminal motive]] and [[intention (criminal law)|criminal intent]]; the offender's motives or purposes may be admirable and praiseworthy, but his intent may still be criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Reconstructing the Criminal Defenses: The Significance of Justification|author=Thomas Morawetz|publisher=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (1973-)|volume=77|issue=2|date=Summer 1986|pages=277–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the saying that "if there is any possible justification of civil disobedience it must come from outside the legal system."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Arthur W. Munk|title=Civil Disobedience: Conscience, Tactics, and the Law|publisher=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=397|date=Sep 1971|pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory is that, while disobedience may be helpful, any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit. Therefore, conscientious lawbreakers must be punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Legal Toleration of Civil Disobedience|author=Robert T. Hall|publisher=Ethics|volume=81|issue=2|date=Jan 1971|pages=128–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a [[test case]] as to the [[constitutionality]] of a law, and then wins his case, then that act did not constitute civil disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Justifiability of Civil Disobedience|author=Michael Bayles|publisher=The Review of Metaphysics|volume=24|issue=1|date=Sep 1970|pages=3–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification, as in the case of a [[homosexual]] or [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law, is not civil disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Justifying Political Disobedience|author=Leslie J. Macfarlane|publisher=Ethics|volume=79|issue=1|date=Oct 1968|pages=24–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution, or by denying having committed the crime, or by fleeing the jurisdiction, is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient.

Courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience: "Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|url=http://openjurist.org/939/f2d/826/united-states-v-d-schoon|litigants=U.S.  v. Schoon|vol=939|reporter=F2d|opinion=826|date= July 29, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Vietnam War]], courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the [[legality of the Vietnam War]]; the courts ruled it was a [[political question]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=43|publisher=N.Y.U. L.

Bauer and Peter J. Eckerstrom|publisher=Stanford Law Review|volume=39|issue=5|date=May 1987|pages=1173–1200}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, court cases such as ''[[United States v. Schoon]]'' have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Demise of the Political Necessity Defense: Indirect Civil Disobedience and United States v. Schoon|author=James L. Cavallaro Jr.|publisher=California Law Review|volume=81|issue=1|date=Jan 1993|pages=351–385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the [[Clamshell Alliance]]'s 1977 illegal occupation of the [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant]], the judge instructed the jury to disregard his [[competing harms]] defence, and he was found guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Beyond Vietnam: The Politics of Protest in Massachusetts, 1974-1990|author=Robert Surbrug}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fully Informed Jury Association]] activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to; according to the association, many of them have escaped prosecution because "prosecutors have reasoned (correctly) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fija.org/docs/JG_If_You_are_Facing_Charges.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820202006/http://www.fija.org/docs/JG_If_You_are_Facing_Charges.pdf |archive-date=20 August 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with giving the offender his [[Retributive justice|"just deserts"]], achieving [[crime control]] via [[incapacitation (law)|incapacitation]] and [[deterrence (law)|deterrence]] is a major goal of [[criminal punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|18|3553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ussc.gov/2009guid/1a1.htm |publisher=2009 Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual |title=3.

This means that the objector has no right not to be punished. It is a matter for the state (including the judges) to decide on [[utilitarian]] grounds whether to do so or not.".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldjudgmt/jd030320/sepet-2.htm|title=Judgments - Sepet (FC) and Another (FC) (Appellants) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent)|date=20 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman also asserted that while the "rules of the game" for protesters were to remain non-violent while breaking the law, the authorities must recognize that demonstrators are acting out of their conscience in pursuit of democracy. "When it comes to punishment, the court should take into account their personal convictions", he said.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1655502/punish-surrendering-occupy-protesters-leniently-urges-hong-kong-top&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''constructive developmental framework''' ('''CDF''') is a theoretical framework for [[epistemological]] and [[psychological assessment]] of adults. The framework is based on empirical developmental research showing that an individual's perception of reality is an actively constructed "[[Idios kosmos|world of their own]]", unique to them and which they continue to develop over their lifespan.

CDF was developed by Otto Laske based on the work of [[Robert Kegan]] and Michael Basseches, Laske's teachers at [[Harvard University]]. The CDF methodology involves three separate instruments that respectively measure a person's social–emotional stage, cognitive level of development, and psychological profile. It provides three epistemological perspectives on individual clients as well as teams.&lt;ref name="MHD1"&gt;Laske, Otto E.: Measuring hidden dimensions. The art and science of fully engaging adults. Volume 1. Interdevelopmental Institute Press, Medford, MA 2006, {{ISBN|0-9776800-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]]s are designed to probe how an individual and/or group [[Construals|constructs the real world conceptually]], and how close an individual's present thinking approaches the complexity of the real world.

==Overview==
The methodology of CDF is grounded in empirical research on [[positive adult development]] which began under [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] in the 1960s, continued by [[Robert Kegan]] (1982, 1994), Michael Basseches 1984, and Otto Laske (1998, 2006, 2009, 2015, 2018). Laske (1998, 2009) introduced concepts from [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s philosophy and the [[Frankfurt School]] into the framework, making a strict differentiation between social–emotional and cognitive development.

Kegan (1982) described five stages of development, of which the latter four are progressively attained only in adulthood. Basseches (1984) showed that adults potentially transcend formal logical thinking by way of dialectical thinking, in four phases, measurable by a fluidity index. Both Kegan's and Basseches' findings were updated and refined by Laske in 2005 and 2008 respectively. In 2008 and 2015, Laske proposed that dialectical thought forms are an instantiation of Bhaskar's ''four moments of dialectic'' (MELD; Bhaskar 1993), and that these ontological moments form a sequence M→E→L→D that underlies individual cognitive development (Laske 2015), providing a basis for a dialectical cognitive science as well as a cognitively oriented management science. Based on the concept of 'dialogical dialectic', Laske stressed the need for a dialogical, in contrast to a monological, social science.The CDF methodology involves three separate instruments that respectively measure a person's social–emotional stage ('what should I do and for whom?'), cognitive level of development ('what can I know and what therefore are my options?'), and psychological profile ('how am I doing right now?'). The first two tools (ED, CD) provide an epistemological, the third (NP) a psychological, perspective on a person or team. See the list of references below.

In CDF, social-emotional, cognitive, and psychological assessment are arrived at separately, as follows:
# A person's social-emotional profile addresses the question "What should I do and for whom?"; it is evaluated based on a semi-structured 1-hour interview in terms of "stages" (created by Kegan-Lahey in 1988, refined by Laske 2005).
# A person's cognitive profile addresses the question "What can I know and what consequently are my options?"; it is evaluated based on a semi-structured 1-hour interview in terms of "dialectical thought forms" and the fluidity of their use during the interview or in a written text (Basseches 1984; refined by Laske 2008).
# A person's psychological profile addresses the question "How am I presently doing?"; it is evaluated based on Morris Aderman's Need-Press Questionnaire (NP) grounded in [[Henry Murray]]'s theory of personality (Aderman 1970).

In CDF, each of these profiles by itself is considered a pure abstraction since it is only in their togetherness that the "hidden dimensions of a person's consciousness" can be empirically understood and made the basis of an intervention. Importantly, a CDF intervention requires dialectical thinking, in contrast to purely logical thinking as used in positivistic research. For this reason, CDF is a model of dialogical, not monological, research.

==Social–emotional development ==

=== Stages of adult development ===
According to the developmental psychologist [[Robert Kegan]],&lt;ref name="ES"&gt;Kegan, Robert: The evolving self: problem and process in human development. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA 1982, {{ISBN|0-674-27231-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; a person's self-concept evolves in a series of stages through their lifetime. Such evolution is driven alternately by two main motivations: that of being autonomous and that of belonging to a group. Human beings are "controlled" by these motivations in the sense that they do not have influence on them but are rather defined by them. Additionally, these motivations are in conflict and their relationship develops over a lifespan.&lt;ref name="MHD1"/&gt;{{rp|31}}

Kegan describes 5 stages of development, of which the latter 4 are progressively attained in adulthood, although only a small proportion of adults reach the fourth stage and beyond:
* Stage 1: Purely impulse or reflex-driven (infancy and early childhood).
* Stage 2: The person's sense of self is ruled by their needs and wishes. The needs and wishes of others are relevant only to the extent that they support those of the person. Effectively the person and others inhabit two "separate worlds" (childhood to adolescence).
* Stage 3: The person's sense of self is socially determined, based on the real or imagined expectations of others (post-adolescence).
* Stage 4: The person's sense of self is determined by a set of values that they have authored for themselves (rarely achieved, only in adulthood).
* Stage 5: The person's sense of self is no longer bound to any particular aspect of themselves or their history, and they are free to allow themselves to focus on the flow of their lives.

CDF refers to such stages as "social–emotional" in that they relate to the way a person makes meaning of their experience in the social world. CDF holds that people are rarely precisely at a single stage but more accurately are distributed over a range where they are subject to the conflicting influences of a higher and a lower stage.

=== Assessing the social–emotional profile of a person ===
The social–emotional profile of person is assessed by means of an interview, referred to as the "subject–object" interview.&lt;ref name="ES"/&gt; In the interview, the interviewer offers prompts such as "success", "change", "control", "limits", "frustration", and "risk" and invites the interviewee to describe meaningful experiences under those headings. The interviewer serves as a listener, whose role is to focus the attention of the interviewee onto their own thoughts and feelings.

The interview is scored by identifying excerpts of speech that indicate a particular stage or sub-stage. Relevant sections are chosen from the transcript of the interview and analyzed for indications of the stage of development. The most frequent sub-stage revealed by the scoring is described as the interviewee's "centre of gravity". Stages scored at below the center of gravity are described as "risk" (of regression) while stages scored above the center of gravity are described as "potential" (for development). The distribution of scores is summarized by a "risk–clarity–potential" index (RCP) that can be used to characterize the nature of the developmental challenges facing a person.

== Cognitive development ==

=== Eras of adult cognitive development ===
According to [[Jean Piaget]], thinking develops in 4 stages from childhood to young adulthood. Piaget named these stages sensory-motor, pre-operational, concrete-operational, and formal-operational. Development of formal-operational thinking is considered to continue until approximately until the 25th year of life. Subsequent researchers have concentrated on the now famous question of Kohlberg: "Is there a life after 25?" In CDF, the development of post formal-operational thinking in an adult is indicated primarily by the strength of dialectical thinking measured in thought form use fluidity.&lt;ref name="MHD2"&gt;Laske, Otto E.: Measuring hidden dimensions. Foundations of requisite organization. Volume 2. Interdevelopmental Institute Press, Medford, MA 2009, {{ISBN|978-09776800-6-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120}}

Following Bhaskar (1993), in CDF, human thinking is seen as developing in four sequential phases or 'eras', termed 'common sense', 'understanding', 'reason' and finally 'practical wisdom'.&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt;{{rp|208}}&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar, Roy: Dialectic. The pulse of freedom. Verso, London &amp; New York 1993, {{ISBN|0-86091-368-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first three phases of thinking development can be related to the different thinking systems put forward by the philosophers [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and Hegel. Each phase includes and transcends the thinking system of the previous phase. The final phase of 'practical wisdom' loops back to a higher form of 'common sense' in that it constitutes sophisticated thinking that has become second nature and is therefore effortless.&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt;{{rp|128}} In contrast to other adult development researchers such as [[Kurt W. Fischer|Fischer]] and [[Michael Commons|Commons]], Laske describes post-formal cognitive development in terms of the use and co-ordination of dialectical thought forms and thought form constellations which were described by Basseches as mental schemata.&lt;ref name="basseches"&gt;Basseches, Michael: Dialectical thinking and adult development. Ablex Publishing, Norwood, NJ 1984, {{ISBN|0-89391-017-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Four classes of dialectical thought forms ===
{{See also|DSRP}}
Dialectical thinking has its roots in Greek classical philosophy but is also found in ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophy, and relates to the search for truth through reasoned argument. It finds its foremost expression in the work of the German philosopher Georg Hegel. Essentially, [[dialectics]] is viewed as the system by which human thought attempts to capture the nature of reality. Building on [[Roy Bhaskar|Bhaskar]] and Basseches, CDF uses a framework for dialectical thinking based on the idea that everything in reality is transient and composed of contradictions, part of a larger whole, related in some way to everything else, and subject to sudden transformation. This framework therefore distinguishes dialectical thinking in terms of four classes of dialectical thought forms that can be said to define reality:&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt;{{rp|224}}

* Process (P) – constant change; emergence from absence: this class of thought forms describes how things or systems emerge, evolve and disappear;
* Context (C) – stable structures: this class of thought forms describes how things are part of the structure of a larger, stable, organized whole. The contextualization of parts within a whole gives rise to different perspectives or points of view;
* Relationship (R) – unity in diversity; totality: this class of thought forms describes how things (which are all part of a larger whole) are related and the nature of their common ground;
* Transformation (T) – balance and evolution including breakdown: this class of thought forms describes how living systems are in constant development and transformation, potentially via a collapse of the previous form of organization, and subject to the influence of human agency.

In addition, CDF distinguishes seven individual thought forms for every class, making a total of 28 thought forms, representing a re-formulation of Basseches' 24 schematas.&lt;ref name="basseches"/&gt;

=== The cognitive profile of a person ===
The cognitive profile describes the thinking tools at a person's disposal and shows the degree to which a person's thinking has developed as indicated by their use of dialectical thought forms in the four classes. The profile is derived by means of a semi-structured interview where the interviewer has the task of eliciting the interviewee's use of thought forms in a conversation about the interviewee's work and workplace. The text of the interview is subsequently analyzed and scored to give a series of mathematical indicators.

According to CDF thinking that is highly developed is represented by the following features:

* a balanced use of all four classes of dialectical thought forms (P, C, R, T)
* a high index of systemic thinking—meaning the use of transformative thought forms (T) and
* balanced use of critical and constructive thought forms (P+R) vs. (C+T)

== Link between social–emotional development and cognitive development ==
Social–emotional and cognitive development are often seen as separate lines of development&lt;ref&gt;Wilber, Ken: Integral spirituality. Shambala, Boston MA. 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-59030-346-7}}, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; but Laske (2008) proposed that they are linked by "stages of reflective judgment"&lt;ref&gt;King, Patricia M. &amp; Kitchener, Karen S.: Developing reflective judgment. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, CA 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-555-42629-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "epistemic position",&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt;{{rp|137}} described as the view taken by a person on what constitutes "knowledge" and "truth". Epistemic position defines a person's ability to deal with uncertainty and insecurity in their knowledge of the world and, together with the stage of social–emotional development, reflects the "stance" that a person takes towards the world. Whilst cognitive development provides a person with "tools" for thinking consisting of thought forms derived from both logic and dialectics,&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt; the "stance" that a person takes determines whether they apply the thinking tools at their disposal.

== Personality ==

=== Psychogenic needs and press ===
CDF employs the theory put forward by psychologist Henry Murray that much of human behavior is determined by the effort to satisfy certain psychological (or "psychogenic" needs), most of which are unconscious. Personality is thus seen as characteristic behavior emerging from the dynamic between a person's pattern of psychogenic needs and the environmental forces acting on that person—termed "press".

The need–press analysis draws on [[Sigmund Freud]]'s model of the human psyche divided into the components of Id, Ego and Super-ego. In living, a person is subject to the unconscious yearnings of the Id, whilst consciously aspiring to certain ideals imposed by the Super-ego, which itself is influenced by the social context. It is the dynamic balance between the forces of Id and Super-ego and the work environment that determines a person's capacity for work. Imbalances between the social reality of work and a person's ideals lead to frustration, and imbalances between a person's unconscious needs and their ideals lead to a waste of energy or "energy sink."&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt;{{rp|419}}

=== The personality profile of a person ===
CDF assessment methodology uses a self-report psychometric questionnaire originated by Henry Murray's student Morris Aderman, called the need–press (NP) inventory.

The questionnaire assesses psychological characteristics in terms of three categories: ''self-conduct, task focus, and interpersonal perspective,'', each of them defined by 6 variables assessed independently. The questionnaire compares a person's current needs with 1) what they would be like in an ideal (moral) world and 2) what they perceive they are offered in actuality (such as a specific cultural environment they are in tune or at odds with). Each category is composed of several categories (scales) such as: need for control, drive to achieve, affiliation etc. Comparisons and interpretation can be made between a person's scores for "Need", and their scores for ideal and actual "Press". Comparisons can also be made between a person's scores and those of the group of people with whom they are working. Finally, NP scores can be linked to developmental scores (ED &amp; CD), whether of an individual or team.

== Applications ==

=== Assessment of work capability ===
The assessment methodology employed by CDF was created to measure peoples' capability and capacity for work. The theory of work used by CDF is derived from the work of [[Elliott Jaques]]. According to Jaques,&lt;ref name="jaques"&gt;Jaques, Elliott: Requisite organization: the CEO's guide to creative structure and leadership. Cason Hall, Arlington, VA 1989, {{ISBN|0-9621070-0-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; work is defined as the application of reflective judgment in order to pursue certain goals within certain time limits. This definition stresses the importance of how decisions are made in a complex world and the time-span within which decisions are carried out. While Jaques offers a strictly cognitive definition of work, CDF views the social–emotional aspects of work as equally important, also including the person's (manager's, CEO's) NP profile.

CDF distinguishes between two kinds of work capability, applied and potential. Applied capability refers to the resources that an individual can already apply in order to carry out work. Potential capability refers to the resources that an individual may be capable of applying in the future.&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt;{{rp|57}} An individual can decide at any time not to apply their potential work capability. Equally circumstances may impede a person from applying their potential capability. Work capability is therefore not the same as the capacity to deliver work but rather defines and limits it.

In CDF work capacity is measured in terms of the need–press personality profile, whilst applied capability is measured in terms of the thinking tools shown up by the cognitive profile, and potential capability is measured in terms of the risk–clarity–potential score taken from the social–emotional profile.

=== Organizational talent management ===
For Elliot Jaques,&lt;ref name="jaques" /&gt; human organizations are structured managerially according to levels of accountability. Each level of accountability entails a higher level of complexity in the work required of the role-holder, termed "size of role". Jaques defined the notion of [[requisite organization]], where roles in an organization are hierarchically organized at specific levels of increasing complexity.

The application of CDF as an assessment methodology to measure the "size of person" in terms of their work capability and capacity provides a way forward for [[talent management system]]s to match the "size of person" to the "size of role". Progressively more complex roles require progressively higher levels of social–emotional development and cognitive development in the role-holder. In this way requisite organizations can align their human capability architecture with their managerial accountability architecture&lt;ref name="MHD2"/&gt;{{rp|84}} and design "growth assignments"&lt;ref&gt;DeVisch, Jan: The vertical dimension. 2010, {{ISBN|978-94-9069-538-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that facilitate the development of capability for more complex roles.

=== Coaching ===
CDF provides a platform for professional coaching such as in [[leadership development]] and [[management development]] in a variety of ways. Firstly it provides assessment tools from which the coach can construct an integrated model of the coachee complete with the developmental challenges of the client who is to be helped. Secondly, and in the sense used by [[Edgar Schein]]&lt;ref&gt;Schein, Edgar H.: Process consultation revisited. Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA 1999, {{ISBN|0-201-34596-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of the assessment tools and the feedback of results by the coach is an act of "process consultation" by which the client may come to understand better the assumptions, values, attitudes and behaviors that are helping or hindering their success. Thirdly, CDF provides tools for deeper and more sophisticated thinking, thereby enabling the client to explore and expand their conceptual landscape of a problem.

CDF distinguishes between behavioral and developmental coaching. The goal of behavioral coaching is to improve the client's actual performance at work, described in CDF terms as their applied capability. In contrast, the goal of developmental coaching is to illuminate and develop the client's current and emergent capabilities for work in the context of their cognitive and social–emotional development.

=== Self-organization in teams ===
As shown in the book ''Dynamic Collaboration: Strengthening Self Organization and Collaborative Intelligence in Teams'', by Jan De Visch and Otto Laske (2018), CDF can be a tool for building in organizations a ''dialogical culture'' by which distributed leadership in organizations can be realized.

'''Cristina Rodrigues''' ([[Porto]], born 1 July 1980) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] artist and [[architect]]. Her [[art work]] was the main feature and cover of 2016's January/February issue of the American magazine [[Sculpture (magazine)|SCULPTURE]], one of the world's most relevant publications on that field.

==Life and career==
The eclecticism which characterises her work can be traced back to her studies in [[Architecture]], [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] History and [[Contemporary Art]]. She graduated in Architecture (2014) and completed a [[Masters degree]] in Medieval and Renaissance History (2007) at the University of Porto, Portugal. Later she moved to [[Manchester]], [[United Kingdom]], where she lectured at university and was awarded a [[PhD]] in [[Art and Design]] at [[Manchester School of Art]] (2016).

In 2011 Cristina was awarded a research grant by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] to develop her ongoing research project ‘Design for Desertification’. She then focused her research work on the study and register of Portuguese territories with low population density. She also began to create some of her most poignant contemporary art work, and textiles became her trade mark from the outset. The recurring use of satin ribbons, industrial fabrics and lace has been a distinguishing feature in her aesthetic narrative.

Manchester, the old textile capital of [[Europe]], became her chosen home for seven years and during this time Cristina focused on the study of Contemporary Art. By combining her many interests, namely culture, [[oral traditions]] and textiles, she created ''[[The Blanket]]'', one of her most emblematic works. The original version of this contemporary art installation was made with [[Idanha-a-Nova|Idanha-a-Nova’s]] traditional instrument, the [[adufe]], cotton lace and satin ribbons.

==Themes==

Cristina Rodrigues interprets reality by analyzing mentalities and [[iconographies]] in contemporary society. The dialectics between tradition and contemporaneity is central to her work.

Her art celebrates the role of women in contemporary society. Items which are characteristic of the female universe are used in her works of art. Cotton lace, satin ribbons, glass and crystal necklaces are combined with iron and musical instruments in order to build narratives. [[Ready-made]] necklaces bought in the [[pound shop]] are combined with luxurious china, in an eclectic blend creating an analogy with contemporary society.

[[Emigration]], a theme which is particularly relevant to her generation, is addressed in some of her work, namely the sculpture ''[[Grapes of Wrath (sculpture)|Grapes of Wrath]]'', inspired by [[John Steinbeck|John Steinbeck’s]] work. Herself a migrant, for several years Cristina collected furniture that had belonged to migrants from the various communities in Manchester, United Kingdom. The contemporary art installation titled ''[[Bourgeois (art instalation)|Bourgeois]]'' comprises four chairs previously owned by an Iranian family living in Stockport, United Kingdom. Like these, several other conventional furnishing underwent an intervention by the artist, transforming them into luxury objects.

==Works==

''[[In situ]]'', Cristina’s [[art installation]]s and [[sculpture]]s adorne ordinary objects with [[baroque]] detail. She combines creative flair with everyday items. Each of her art installations is locally inspired yet universal in meaning, and it intentionally touches the lives of all those involved in its artistic production. Cristina’s practice is marked by simple aesthetics, almost always based on [[ethnographic]] research.

The patterns and stereotomies produced by the recurring satin ribbons are one of Cristina’s trademarks. However, with reference to narratives and artefacts that are familiar to her daily life, Cristina essentially uses popular materials, which relate to a woman’s condition and draws on crafting techniques usually associated to domestic crafts.

==Partnerships==

During her artistic career Cristina Rodrigues worked in partnership with different public and private entities and some of the most significant Portuguese brands. Cristina has been working closely with the Porto lace mill - [http://www.rendasportuense.pt/ Fábrica de Rendas Portuense], - since 2011. This mill still produces cotton lace using original industrial revolution machinery, acquired from a mill in Leicester, United Kingdom.
Recently, Cristina Rodrigues collaborated with other brands such as: [[Licor Beirão]], the artist produced a large scale iron sculpture titled [[The Fountain of Happiness (sculpture)|''The Fountain of Happiness'']] with Licor Beirão glass bottles; [https://www.icel.pt/index.php?id=4 ICEL], a cutlery brand and the Portuguese shoes brand [http://www.flylondon.com/ FLY London], which inspired her art installation titled ''[[Urban Dwellers (art installation)|Urban Dwellers]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1294">The '''Cry of Alcorta''' ({{lang-es|Grito de Alcorta}}) was an agrarian rebellion that took place in 1912 in [[Alcorta]], [[Argentina]]. It began at the south of the [[Santa Fe Province]], with requests of better working conditions and better contracts. These demonstrations bore no similarity to the contemporary [[Anarchism in Argentina|anarchists]]. On June 25 the workers refused to harvest before their requests were met. The protest quickly expanded to Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Entre Ríos and Santa Fe. Although the workers had discontent with the leasing system, they did not request the complete eradication but just better terms; the few workers that proposed a radical goal did not prevail. The protest achieved the desired goals, and the [[Federación Agraria Argentina]] was established on August 15.

"'''Darwin among the Machines'''" is the name of an article published in ''[[The Press]]'' newspaper on 13 June 1863 in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, which references the work of [[Charles Darwin]] in the title. Written by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] but signed ''[[Cellarius (name)|Cellarius]]'' ([[q.v.]]), the article raised the possibility that [[machines]] were a kind of "mechanical life" undergoing constant [[evolution]], and that eventually machines might supplant humans as the dominant species:
{{quote|We refer to the question: What sort of creature man’s next successor in the supremacy of the earth is likely to be. We have often heard this debated; but it appears to us that we are ourselves creating our own successors; we are daily adding to the beauty and delicacy of their physical organisation; we are daily giving them greater power and supplying by all sorts of ingenious contrivances that self-regulating, self-acting power which will be to them what intellect has been to the human race. In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race.
...

Day by day, however, the machines are gaining ground upon us; day by day we are becoming more subservient to them; more men are daily bound down as slaves to tend them, more men are daily devoting the energies of their whole lives to the development of mechanical life. The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.}}

The article ends by urging that, "War to the death should be instantly proclaimed against them. Every machine of every sort should be destroyed by the well-wisher of his species. Let there be no exceptions made, no quarter shown; let us at once go back to the primeval condition of the race."

==''Book of the Machines''==
Butler developed this and subsequent articles into ''The Book of the Machines'', three chapters of ''[[Erewhon]]'', published anonymously in 1872. The Erewhonian society Butler envisioned had long ago undergone a revolution that destroyed most mechanical inventions. The narrator of the story finds a book that details the reasons for this revolution, which he translates for the reader. In &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;
chapter xxiii: the book of the machines&lt;/span&gt;, a number of quotes from this imaginary book discuss the possibility of machine consciousness:
{{quote|"There is no security"--to quote his own words--"against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness, in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now. A mollusc has not much consciousness. Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing. The more highly organized machines are creatures not so much of yesterday, as of the last five minutes, so to speak, in comparison with past time.
...

“Either,” he proceeds, “a great deal of action that has been called purely mechanical and unconscious must be admitted to contain more elements of consciousness than has been allowed hitherto (and in this case germs of consciousness will be found in many actions of the higher machines)—Or (assuming the theory of evolution but at the same time denying the consciousness of vegetable and crystalline action) the race of man has descended from things which had no consciousness at all. In this case there is no ''à priori'' improbability in the descent of conscious (and more than conscious) machines from those which now exist, except that which is suggested by the apparent absence of anything like a reproductive system in the mechanical kingdom.}}
Later, in &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;chapter xxiv: the machines—continued&lt;/span&gt;, the imaginary book also discusses the notion that machines can "reproduce" like living organisms:
{{quote|“But the machines which reproduce machinery do not reproduce machines after their own kind. A thimble may be made by machinery, but it was not made by, neither will it ever make, a thimble. Here, again, if we turn to nature we shall find abundance of analogies which will teach us that a reproductive system may be in full force without the thing produced being of the same kind as that which produced it. Very few creatures reproduce after their own kind; they reproduce something which has the potentiality of becoming that which their parents were. Thus the butterfly lays an egg, which egg can become a caterpillar, which caterpillar can become a chrysalis, which chrysalis can become a butterfly; and though I freely grant that the machines cannot be said to have more than the germ of a true reproductive system at present, have we not just seen that they have only recently obtained the germs of a mouth and stomach?  And may not some stride be made in the direction of true reproduction which shall be as great as that which has been recently taken in the direction of true feeding?

“It is possible that the system when developed may be in many cases a vicarious thing. Certain classes of machines may be alone fertile, while the rest discharge other functions in the mechanical system, just as the great majority of ants and bees have nothing to do with the continuation of their species, but get food and store it, without thought of breeding. One cannot expect the parallel to be complete or nearly so; certainly not now, and probably never; but is there not enough analogy existing at the present moment, to make us feel seriously uneasy about the future, and to render it our duty to check the evil while we can still do so?  Machines can within certain limits beget machines of any class, no matter how different to themselves. Every class of machines will probably have its special mechanical breeders, and all the higher ones will owe their existence to a large number of parents and not to two only.

“Complex now, but how much simpler and more intelligibly organised may it not become in another hundred thousand years? or in twenty thousand?  For man at present believes that his interest lies in that direction; he spends an incalculable amount of labour and time and thought in making machines breed always better and better; he has already succeeded in effecting much that at one time appeared impossible, and there seem no limits to the results of accumulated improvements if they are allowed to descend with modification from generation to generation.}}
This notion of machine "reproduction" anticipates the later notion of [[self-replicating machine]]s, although in &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;chapter xxv: the machines—concluded&lt;/span&gt;, the imaginary book supposes that while there is a danger that humans will become subservient to machines, the machines will still need humans to assist in their reproduction and maintenance:
{{quote|“Herein lies our danger. For many seem inclined to acquiesce in so dishonourable a future. They say that although man should become to the machines what the horse and dog are to us, yet that he will continue to exist, and will probably be better off in a state of domestication under the beneficent rule of the machines than in his present wild condition. We treat our domestic animals with much kindness. We give them whatever we believe to be the best for them; and there can be no doubt that our use of meat has increased their happiness rather than detracted from it. In like manner there is reason to hope that the machines will use us kindly, for their existence will be in a great measure dependent upon ours; they will rule us with a rod of iron, but they will not eat us; they will not only require our services in the reproduction and education of their young, but also in waiting upon them as servants; in gathering food for them, and feeding them; in restoring them to health when they are sick; and in either burying their dead or working up their deceased members into new forms of mechanical existence.}}
The author of the imaginary book goes on to say that while life under [[machine rule]] might be materially comfortable for humans, the thought of the human race being superseded in the future is just as horrifying to him as the thought that his distant ancestors were anything other than fully human (apparently Butler imagines the author to be an [[Anti-evolution]]ist), so he urges that all machines which have been in use for less than 300 years be destroyed to prevent this future from coming to pass:
{{quote|“The power of custom is enormous, and so gradual will be the change, that man's sense of what is due to himself will be at no time rudely shocked; our bondage will steal upon us noiselessly and by imperceptible approaches; nor will there ever be such a clashing of desires between man and the machines as will lead to an encounter between them. Among themselves the machines will war eternally, but they will still require man as the being through whose agency the struggle will be principally conducted. In point of fact there is no occasion for anxiety about the future happiness of man so long as he continues to be in any way profitable to the machines; he may become the inferior race, but he will be infinitely better off than he is now. Is it not then both absurd and unreasonable to be envious of our benefactors?  And should we not be guilty of consummate folly if we were to reject advantages which we cannot obtain otherwise, merely because they involve a greater gain to others than to ourselves?

“With those who can argue in this way I have nothing in common. I shrink with as much horror from believing that my race can ever be superseded or surpassed, as I should do from believing that even at the remotest period my ancestors were other than human beings. Could I believe that ten hundred thousand years ago a single one of my ancestors was another kind of being to myself, I should lose all self-respect, and take no further pleasure or interest in life. I have the same feeling with regard to my descendants, and believe it to be one that will be felt so generally that the country will resolve upon putting an immediate stop to all further mechanical progress, and upon destroying all improvements that have been made for the last three hundred years. I would not urge more than this. We may trust ourselves to deal with those that remain, and though I should prefer to have seen the destruction include another two hundred years, I am aware of the necessity for compromising, and would so far sacrifice my own individual convictions as to be content with three hundred. Less than this will be insufficient.”}}
Erewhonian society came to the conclusion "...that the machines were ultimately destined to supplant the race of man, and to become instinct with a vitality as different from, and superior to, that of animals, as animal to vegetable life. So... they made a clean sweep of all machinery that had not been in use for more than two hundred and seventy-one years..." (from &lt;span style=
"font-variant:small-caps"&gt;
chapter ix: to the metropolis&lt;/span&gt;.)

Despite the initial popularity of ''Erewhon'', Butler commented in the preface to the second edition that reviewers had "in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on Machines as an attempt to reduce Mr. Darwin’s theory to an absurdity." He protested that "few things would be more distasteful to me than any attempt to laugh at Mr. Darwin", but also added "I am surprised, however, that the book at which such an example of the specious misuse of analogy would seem most naturally levelled should have occurred to no reviewer; neither shall I mention the name of the book here, though I should fancy that the hint given will suffice",&lt;ref&gt;[[Project Gutenberg]] eBook [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1906 ''Erewhon'' by Samuel Butler.]&lt;/ref&gt; which may suggest that the chapter on Machines was in fact a satire intended to illustrate the "specious misuse of analogy", even if the target was not Darwin; Butler, fearing that he had offended Darwin, wrote him a letter explaining that the actual target was [[Joseph Butler]]'s 1736 ''The Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature''. The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] scholar Herbert Sussman has suggested that although Butler's exploration of machine evolution was intended to be whimsical, he may also have been genuinely interested in the notion that living organisms are a type of mechanism and was exploring this notion with his writings on machines,&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's "the Book of the Machines" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365–383&lt;/ref&gt; while the philosopher Louis Flaccus called it "a mixture of fun, satire, and thoughtful speculation."&lt;ref&gt;Flaccus, Louis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JigdAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false University lectures delivered by members of the faculty in the free public lecture course], p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Evolution of Global Intelligence''==
[[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]] applies Butler's original [[premise]] to the [[artificial life]] and [[artificial intelligence|intelligence]] of [[Alan Turing]] in '''''Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence''''' (1998) {{ISBN|0-7382-0030-1}}, to suggest that the internet is a living, [[sentient]] [[being]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dyson's main claim is that the evolution of a conscious mind from today's technology is inevitable. It is not clear whether this will be a single mind or multiple minds, how smart that mind would be, and even if we will be able to communicate with it. He also clearly suggests that there are forms of intelligence on Earth that we are currently unable to understand.

From the book: "What mind, if any, will become apprehensive of the great coiling of ideas now under way is not a meaningless question, but it is still too early in the game to expect an answer that is meaningful to us."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tal.forum2.org/darwin Excerpted from review] by [http://tal.forum2.org/author_Tal%20Cohen Tal Cohen], 30 September 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Disjunkte Mengen.svg|thumb|Two disjoint sets.]]

In [[mathematics]], two [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] are said to be '''disjoint sets''' if they have no [[element (mathematics)|element]] in common. Equivalently, disjoint sets are sets whose [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] is the [[empty set]].&lt;ref name="halmos"&gt;{{citation|title=Naive Set Theory|series=[[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]]|first=P. R.|last=Halmos|authorlink=Paul Halmos|publisher=Springer|year=1960|isbn=9780387900926|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6cZBQ9qtgoC&amp;pg=PA15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are ''disjoint sets,'' while {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5} are not disjoint.

==Generalizations==
[[File:Disjuct-sets.svg|thumb|A pairwise disjoint family of sets]]
This definition of disjoint sets can be extended to any [[family of sets]]. A family of sets is '''pairwise disjoint''' or '''mutually disjoint''' if every two different sets in the family are disjoint.&lt;ref name="halmos"/&gt;
For example, the collection of sets {{nowrap|1={ {1}, {2}, {3}, ... } }} is pairwise disjoint.

Two sets are said to be [[almost disjoint sets]] if their intersection is small in some sense. For instance, two [[infinite set]]s whose intersection is a [[finite set]] may be said to be almost disjoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Combinatorial Set Theory: With a Gentle Introduction to Forcing|series=Springer monographs in mathematics|first=Lorenz J.|last=Halbeisen|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=9781447121732|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZVb54INnywC&amp;pg=PA184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[topology]], there are various notions of [[separated sets]] with more strict conditions than disjointness. For instance, two sets may be considered to be separated when they have disjoint [[Closure (topology)|closure]]s or disjoint [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhoods]]. Similarly, in a [[metric space]], [[positively separated sets]] are sets separated by a nonzero [[metric space|distance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Metric Spaces|volume=57|series=Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics|first=Edward Thomas|last=Copson|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1988|isbn=9780521357326|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=egc5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Example of a pairwise disjoint family of sets.svg|A pairwise disjoint family of sets
File:Example of a non pairwise disjoint family of sets.svg|A non-pairwise-disjoint family of sets
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Intersections==
Disjointness of two sets, or of a family of sets, may be expressed in terms of their [[intersection (set theory)|intersections]].

Two sets ''A'' and ''B'' are disjoint if and only if their intersection &lt;math&gt;A\cap B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[empty set]].&lt;ref name="halmos"/&gt;
It follows from this definition that every set is disjoint from the empty set,
and that the empty set is the only set that is disjoint from itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Bridge to Abstract Mathematics|series=MAA textbooks|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|first1=Ralph W.|last1=Oberste-Vorth|first2=Aristides|last2=Mouzakitis|first3=Bonita A.|last3=Lawrence|year=2012|isbn=9780883857793|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fO3tvd9qjLkC&amp;pg=PA59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A family ''F'' of sets is pairwise disjoint if, for every two sets in the family, their intersection is empty.&lt;ref name="halmos"/&gt;
If the family contains more than one set, this implies that the intersection of the whole family is also empty. However, a family of only one set is pairwise disjoint, regardless of whether that set is empty, and may have a non-empty intersection. Additionally, a family of sets may have an empty intersection without being pairwise disjoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Transition to Advanced Mathematics|first1=Douglas|last1=Smith|first2=Maurice|last2=Eggen|first3=Richard|last3=St. Andre|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|isbn=978-0-495-56202-3|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJUs0ZDOOHoC&amp;pg=PA95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the three sets {{nowrap|1={ {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {1, 3} } }} have an empty intersection but are not pairwise disjoint. In fact, there are no two disjoint sets in this collection. Also the empty family of sets is pairwise disjoint.&lt;ref&gt;See answers to the question [http://math.stackexchange.com/q/1211584/32951 ″Is the empty family of sets pairwise disjoint?″]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Helly family]] is a system of sets within which the only subfamilies with empty intersections are the ones that are pairwise disjoint. For instance, the [[closed interval]]s of the [[real number]]s form a Helly family: if a family of closed intervals has an empty intersection and is minimal (i.e. no subfamily of the family has an empty intersection), it must be pairwise disjoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Combinatorics: Set Systems, Hypergraphs, Families of Vectors, and Combinatorial Probability|first=Béla|last=Bollobás|authorlink=Béla Bollobás|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986|isbn=9780521337038|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=psqFNlngZDcC&amp;pg=PA82}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disjoint unions and partitions==
A [[partition of a set]] ''X'' is any collection of mutually disjoint non-empty sets whose [[union (set theory)|union]] is ''X''.&lt;ref name="h60-28"&gt;{{harvtxt|Halmos|1960}}, p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt; Every partition can equivalently be described by an [[equivalence relation]], a [[binary relation]] that describes whether two elements belong to the same set in the partition.&lt;ref name="h60-28"/&gt;

'''Dominance in ethology''' is an "individual's preferential access to resources over another."&lt;ref&gt;Bland J. (2002) About Gender: Dominance and Male Behaviour http://www.gender.org.uk/about/10ethol/a4_mldom.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Dominance in the context of [[biology]] and [[anthropology]] is the state of having high [[social status]] relative to one or more other individuals, who react [[submission|submissively]] to dominant individuals.  This enables the dominant individual to obtain access to resources such as food or potential mates at the expense of the submissive individual, without active aggression.  The absence or reduction of aggression means unnecessary energy expenditure and the risk of injury are reduced for both.  The opposite of dominance is [[Deference|submissiveness]].

Dominance may be a purely dyadic relationship, i.e. individual A is dominant over individual B, but this has no implications for whether either of these is dominant over a third individual C.  Alternatively, dominance may be hierarchical, with a [[transitive relation]]ship, so that if A dominates B and B dominates C, A always dominates C.  This is called a linear [[dominance hierarchy]].  Some animal societies have [[despotism|despots]], i.e. a single dominant individual with little or no hierarchical structure amongst the rest of the group. Horses use coalitions so that affiliated pairs in a herd have an accumulative dominance to displace a third horse that normally out-ranks both of them on an individual basis.&lt;ref name="Blackshaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/23945615/Ethology-Book| title=Notes on Some Topics in Applied Animal Behaviour by Judith Blackshaw.|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and maintenance==
Dominance may initially be established by fighting, or simply by threatening displays or interchanges.  Once established, however, dominance is usually maintained by agonistic (competitive) behaviours with aggression considerably reduced or sometimes absent.  In the maintenance of dominance relationships, the behaviour of the sub-dominant animal is critical.  If a dominant animal perceives its status is being threatened, it will likely threaten the sub-dominant individual.  The sub-dominant must then either escalate the intensity of the interaction to challenge the dominant, or defer.  In this way, it is often the behaviour of the sub-dominant animal that maintains the dominance relationship, rather than the dominant.

==Functions==

The ultimate function of a dominance hierarchy is to increase the [[Fitness (biology)|individual]] or [[inclusive fitness]] of the animals involved in its formation.  Fighting to acquire resources such as food and mates is expensive in terms of time, energy and the risk of injury.  By developing a dominance hierarchy, animals determine which individuals will get priority of access to resources, particularly when they are limited; there is a reduction in aggression once a pecking order has been developed.  Therefore, the proximate functions of a pecking order are to reduce the costs of time, energy and risk of injury incurred during resource acquisition and defense.

A dominant animal is one whose [[animal sexual behavior|sexual]], feeding, aggressive and other behavior patterns subsequently occur with relatively little influence of the other group members. Subordinate animals are opposite; their behavior can be relatively easily influenced or inhibited by other group members.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoon, J., Johnson, M., &amp; Koch, P. (1998). The nature and measurement of interpersonal dominance. (Volume 65 ed., Vol. Issue 4, pp. 308-335). Communication monograph. Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rcmm20.&lt;/ref&gt; For many animal societies, an individual's position in the dominance hierarchy corresponds with their opportunities to reproduce,&lt;ref&gt;Researchers from University of Washington publish findings in ethology. (2009, August 11). Science Letter, 1136. Retrieved from http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA205165916&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=utoronto_main&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&lt;/ref&gt; however, in other animal societies, the dominance hierarchy may be unrelated to (potential) opportunities to reproduce, e.g. [[naked mole-rat]], [[bees]] and many farm, laboratory, zoo and companion animals. Studies have shown there is a strong association between high testosterone levels and dominance behaviors that help enhance mating success in men.&lt;ref&gt;Slatcher, R., Mehta, P., &amp; Joseph, R. (2011). Testosterone and Self-Reported Dominance Interact to Influence Human Mating Behavior. ''Social Psychological and Personality Science'' 531-539.&lt;/ref&gt;

In hierarchical societies, dominant individuals may exert control over others.  For example, in a herd of feral goats it is a large male that is dominant and maintains discipline and coherence of the flock. He leads the group but shares leadership on a foraging expedition with an old she-goat who will normally outlast a succession of
dominant males.&lt;ref name="MacKenzie, (1980)"&gt;MacKenzie, D. 1980. Goat Husbandry. 4th Edition. Revised and edited by Jean Laing. Faber and Faber, London and Boston. p.66-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, earlier work showed that leadership orders in goats was not related to age or dominance.&lt;ref name="Stewart and Scott, (1947)"&gt;Stewart, J.C. and Scott, J.P. (1947). Lack of correlation between leadership and dominance relationships in a herd of goats. Journal Comparative Physiological Psychology, 40:255-264&lt;/ref&gt;

In sheep, position in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance, but there is no definite study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual sheep.&lt;ref name="Squires and Daws, (1975)"&gt;Squires, V.R. and Daws, G.T. (1975). Leadership and dominance relationships in Merino and Border Leicester sheep. Applied Animal Ethology, 1:263-274&lt;/ref&gt;

In birds, dominant individuals will preferentially select higher perches to put themselves in the best position to detect and avoid predators, as well as to display their dominance to con-specifics.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Portugal, S. J. |author2=Sivess, L. | author3=Martin, G. R. |author4= Butler, P. J.|author5= White, C. R.| year=2017| title=Perch height predicts dominance rank in birds| journal=Ibis| volume=159| pages=456–462 | doi=10.1111/ibi.12447 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested, however, that more commonly, decision-taking about the actions of the group is dissociated from social dominance.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, T.E. (1974).  The concept of social dominance.  ''Behavioral Biology, 11'', 131-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
The first published systematic study of dominance in animals was by [[Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe]] who described in his Ph.D. dissertation of 1921, the social behaviour and priority of access to food by [[Chicken|hens]].
&lt;ref name="Schjelderup-Ebbe, (1922)"&gt;Schjelderup-Ebbe, T. 1922. Beitrage zurSozialpsycholgie des Haushuhns. Zeitschrift Psychologie 88: 225-252. Reprinted in Benchmark Papers in Animal Behaviour/3. Ed. M.W.Schein. 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the [[colloquial]] term "[[pecking order]]"&lt;ref&gt;Porter G. Perrin (1955) 'Pecking Order' 1927-54 American Speech, 30(4):265-268&lt;/ref&gt; describing the hierarchical system of social organization in chickens, although it is sometimes loosely applied to other animals.

Dominance can be measured by the number of times that individuals defer to one another in social interactions, by the length of time that resources are preferentially accessed, by the number/intensity of threats given or other agonistic (competitive) behaviours.  The measurement of dominance is only applicable within the group it is measured since it is a function of the individual members of the group.

==Context dependency==
[[File:Vache herens.jpg|thumb|right|Eringer cattle competing for dominance.]]

Dominance and its organisation can be highly variable depending on the context or individuals involved.

In [[European badgers]], dominance relationships may vary with time as individuals age, gain or lose social status, or change their reproductive condition.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, S.E., Macdonald, D.W. and Dugdale, H.L. (2009). Context-dependent linear dominance hierarchies in social groups of European badgers, ''Meles meles''. Animal Behaviour, 77: 161-169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dominance may also vary across space in [[territory (animal)|territorial]] animals as territory owners are often dominant over all others in their own territory but submissive elsewhere, or dependent on the resource. Even with these factors held constant, perfect dominance hierarchies are rarely found in groups of any great size,&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; at least in the wild. Dominance hierarchies may be more frequently found in captivity, since hierarchies tend to be induced by focused resources such as limited supplies of food supplied in a fixed place.

Dominance hierarchies in small herds of domestic horses are generally linear hierarchies whereas in large herds the relationships are triangular.&lt;ref name="Houpt et al., (1978)"&gt;Houpt, K.A., Law, K. and Martinisi, V. (1978). Dominance hierarchies in domestic horses. Applied Animal Ethology, 4:273–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominance hierarchies can be formed at a very early age. [[Domestic pig]]lets are highly [[wiktionary:precocious|precocious]] and within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, will attempt to suckle.  The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the [[anterior]] teats produce a greater quantity of milk. Once established, this [[Domestic pig#Teat order|teat order]] remains stable with each piglet tending to feed from a particular teat or group of teats.&lt;ref name="CluttonBrock, (1987)"&gt;Clutton-Brock, J., (1987). A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge pp.73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominance–subordination relationships can vary markedly between breeds of the same species. Studies on [[Merino]]s and [[Border Leicester sheep|Border Leicesters]] revealed an almost linear hierarchy in the Merinos but a less rigid structure in the Border Leicesters when a competitive feeding situation was created.&lt;ref name="Squires and Daws, (1975)"/&gt;

The '''donkey''' or '''ass''' (''Equus africanus asinus'')&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Opinion2007/&gt; is a [[Domestication|domesticated]] member of the horse family, [[Equidae]]. The wild ancestor of the donkey is the [[African wild ass]], ''E. africanus''. The donkey has been used as a working animal for at least 5000 years. There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in [[underdeveloped]] countries, where they are used principally as draught or [[pack animal]]s. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels. Small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries.

A male donkey or ass is called a jack, a female a jenny or jennet;&lt;ref name=oad/&gt;&lt;ref name=ncd/&gt;&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; a young donkey is a [[foal]].&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; Jack donkeys are often used to mate with female [[horse]]s to produce [[mule]]s; the biological "reciprocal" of a mule, from a [[stallion]] and jenny as its parents instead, is called a [[hinny]].

Asses were first [[domestication of the horse|domesticated]] around 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, probably in [[Egypt]] or [[Mesopotamia]],&lt;ref name=nowak/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rossel/&gt;  and have spread around the world. They continue to fill important roles in many places today.  While domesticated species are increasing in numbers,  the African wild ass is an [[endangered species]]. As [[Working animal|beasts of burden]] and companions, asses and donkeys have worked together with humans for millennia.

==Scientific and common names==
Traditionally, the scientific name for the donkey is ''Equus asinus asinus'' based on the [[Priority (nomenclature)|principle of priority]] used for scientific names of animals. However, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] ruled in 2003 that if the domestic species and the wild species are considered subspecies of one another, the scientific name of the wild species has priority, even when that subspecies was described after the domestic subspecies.&lt;ref name=Opinion2007/&gt; This means that the proper scientific name for the donkey is ''Equus africanus asinus'' when it is considered a subspecies, and ''Equus asinus'' when it is considered a species.

At one time, the [[synonym]] ''ass'' was the more common term for the donkey. The first recorded use of ''donkey'' was in either 1784&lt;ref name=fairman/&gt; or 1785.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name=grose/&gt;&lt;ref name=diaz/&gt; While the word ''ass'' has [[cognate]]s in most other [[Indo-European languages]], ''donkey'' is an [[etymology|etymologically]] obscure word for which no credible cognate has been identified. Hypotheses on its derivation include the following:
* Perhaps from Spanish, for its [[Don (honorific)|don]]-like gravity; the donkey was also known as "the King of Spain's trumpeter"&lt;ref name=grose/&gt;
* Perhaps a diminutive of ''[[dun gene|dun]]'' (dull grayish-brown), a typical donkey colour.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name=webster/&gt;
* Perhaps from the name ''Duncan''.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD4donkey"/&gt;
* Perhaps of imitative origin.&lt;ref name="AHD4donkey" /&gt;
From the 18th century, ''donkey'' gradually replaced ''ass'', and ''jenny'' replaced ''she-ass'', which is now considered archaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Eselin |website=German-English Dictionary |url=http://www.dict.cc/german-english/Eselin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change may have come about through a tendency to avoid pejorative terms in speech, and be comparable to the substitution in North American English of ''[[rooster]]'' for ''cock'', or that of ''rabbit'' for ''coney'', which was formerly [[homophone|homophonic]] with ''[[cunny]]''. By the end of the 17th century, changes in pronunciation of both ''ass'' and ''[[buttocks|arse]]'' had caused them to become homophones. Other words used for the ass in English from this time include ''cuddy'' in Scotland, ''neddy'' in southwest England and ''dicky'' in the southeast;&lt;ref name=diaz/&gt; ''moke'' is documented in the 19th century, and may be of Welsh or Gypsy origin.

==Characteristics==
{{See also| List of donkey breeds}}
[[File:Skegness4web.jpg|thumb|upright|Classic British seaside donkeys in [[Skegness]]]]  Donkeys vary considerably in size, depending on breed and management. The height at the [[withers]] ranges from {{hands|7.3|to|15.3}}, and the weight from {{convert|80|to|480|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}. Working donkeys in the poorest countries have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years;&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt; in more prosperous countries, they may have a lifespan of 30 to 50 years.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt;

Donkeys are adapted to marginal [[desert]] lands. Unlike [[wild horse|wild]] and [[feral horse]]s, wild donkeys in dry areas are solitary and do not form [[Harem (zoology)|harems]]. Each adult donkey establishes a home range; breeding over a large area may be dominated by one jack.&lt;ref name=svend3/&gt; The loud call or bray of the donkey, which typically lasts for twenty seconds&lt;ref name=canacoo/&gt;&lt;ref name=whitehead/&gt; and can be heard for over three kilometres, may help keep in contact with other donkeys over the wide spaces of the desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2009/wells_kels/Adapation.htm|title = Adaption of Donkeys|date = |accessdate =May 4, 2015|website = BioWeb|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donkeys have large ears, which may pick up more distant sounds, and may help cool the donkey's blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mikesdonkeys.co.uk/facts.html|title = Donkey Facts|date = |accessdate = May 4, 2015|website = Mike's Donkeys|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donkeys can defend themselves by biting, striking with the front hooves or kicking with the hind legs.

===Breeding===
[[File:Equus asinus Kadzidłowo 001.jpg|thumb|left|A 3-week-old donkey]]
A jenny is normally pregnant for about 12 months, though the gestation period varies from 11 to 14 months,&lt;ref name=alberta /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sewell"&gt;[http://www.albertadonkeyandmule.com/pdfs/foaling-out-the-jennet.pdf Sewell, Sybil E.  "Foaling out the Donkey Jennet," ''Alberta Donkey and Mule.com''.  Web page accessed March 4, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and usually gives birth to a single foal. Births of twins are rare, though less so than in horses.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; About 1.7 percent of donkey pregnancies result in twins; both foals survive in about 14 percent of those.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ramshornstudio.com/donkeys.htm|title = Twins and Donkeys|accessdate = May 4, 2015 |website = Rams Horn Studio|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general jennies have a conception rate that is lower than that of horses (''i.e.'' less than the 60–65% rate for mares).&lt;ref name=alberta /&gt;

Although jennies come into heat within 9 or 10 days of giving birth, their fertility remains low, and it is likely the reproductive tract has not returned to normal.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; Thus it is usual to wait one or two further [[oestrous]] cycles before rebreeding, unlike the practice with mares. Jennies are usually very protective of their [[foal]]s, and some will not come into estrus while they have a foal at side.&lt;ref name="Rachau"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oregonvos.net/~jrachau/pregnant.htm |title=Rachau,  Jeanine A. "Gestation and Foaling of Donkeys" |access-date=2015-08-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412031614/http://www.oregonvos.net/~jrachau/pregnant.htm |archive-date=2009-04-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The time lapse involved in rebreeding, and the length of a jenny's gestation, means that a jenny will have fewer than one foal per year. Because of this and the longer gestation period, donkey breeders do not expect to obtain a foal every year, as horse breeders often do, but may plan for three foals in four years.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt;

Donkeys can interbreed with other members of the family Equidae, and are commonly interbred with horses. The [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between a jack and a [[mare]] is a [[mule]], valued as a working and riding animal in many countries. Some large donkey breeds such as the [[Asino di Martina Franca]], the [[Baudet de Poitou]] and the [[American mammoth donkey|Mammoth Jack]] are raised only for mule production. The hybrid between a [[stallion]] and a jenny is a [[hinny]], and is less common. Like other inter-species hybrids, mules and hinnies are usually sterile.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; Donkeys can also breed with [[zebra]]s in which the offspring is called a [[Zebroid|zonkey]] (among other names).

===Behaviour===
Donkeys have a notorious reputation for stubbornness, but this has been attributed to a much stronger sense of [[self-preservation]] than exhibited by horses.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Likely based on a stronger prey instinct and a weaker connection with humans, it is considerably more difficult to force or frighten a donkey into doing something it perceives to be dangerous for whatever reason. Once a person has earned their confidence they can be willing and companionable partners and very dependable in work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hartshorsemanship.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=controller.viewPageThoughtDetail&amp;thoughtUuid=BE68EBFE-4063-C7B3-5EB13796296E636C|title = Training Donkeys|date = |accessdate = May 4, 2015|website = Harts Horsemanship|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although formal studies of their [[ethology|behaviour]] and [[animal cognition|cognition]] are rather limited, donkeys appear to be quite intelligent, cautious, friendly, playful, and eager to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livestockoftheworld.com/Donkeys/AboutDonkeys.asp|title=About Donkeys {{!}} Breeds of Donkeys|last=World|first=Livestock Of The|website=www.livestockoftheworld.com|access-date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Evolution of the horse}}
[[File:Equus eisenmannae.JPG|thumb|Skull of a giant extinct horse, ''Equus eisenmannae'']]
The genus ''Equus'', which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from ''[[Dinohippus]]'', via the intermediate form ''[[Plesippus]]''. One of the oldest species is ''[[Hagerman Horse|Equus simplicidens]]'', described as zebra-like with a donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is ~3.5 million years old from Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged ''Equus livenzovensis'' documented from western Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name = "Azzaroli1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Azzaroli |first=A. |year=1992 |title=Ascent and decline of monodactyl equids: a case for prehistoric overkill |journal=Ann.

Molecular phylogenies indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus ''Equus'') lived ~5.6 (3.9–7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recalibrating ''Equus evolution'' using the genome sequence of an early Middle Pleistocene horse |last1=Orlando|first1= L.|last2=Ginolhac|first2= A.|last3=Zhang|first3= G.|last4=Froese|first4= D.|last5=Albrechtsen|first5= A.|last6=Stiller|first6= M.|last7=Schubert|first7= M.|last8=Cappellini|first8= E.|last9=Petersen|first9= B.|journal=Nature|date=4 July 2013 |doi=10.1038/nature12323 |pmid=23803765 |volume=499 |issue=7456 |pages=74–8|display-authors=etal|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/recalibrating-equus-evolution-using-the-genome-sequence-of-an-early-middle-pleistocene-horse(f4a404d6-2202-4a92-90c7-d113aee17b2d).html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus ''E.

All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] forms) belong to the subgenus ''E.

&lt;ref name=Albano/&gt; Remains of domestic donkeys dating to the fourth millennium BC have been found in [[Ma'adi]] in Lower Egypt, and it is believed that the domestication of the donkey was accomplished long after the domestication of cattle, sheep and goats in the seventh and eighth millennia BC. Donkeys were probably first domesticated by pastoral people in [[Nubia]], and they supplanted the [[ox]] as the chief pack animal of that culture. The domestication of donkeys served to increase the mobility of pastoral cultures, having the advantage over ruminants of not needing time to [[chewing the cud|chew their cud]], and were vital in the development of long-distance trade across Egypt. In the [[Dynasty IV]] era of Egypt, between 2675 and 2565 BC, wealthy members of society were known to own over 1,000 donkeys, employed in agriculture, as dairy and meat animals and as pack animals.&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt;  In 2003, the tomb of either [[Narmer|King Narmer]] or [[Hor-Aha|King Hor-Aha]] (two of the first Egyptian pharaohs) was excavated and the skeletons of ten donkeys were found buried in a manner usually used with high ranking humans. These burials show the importance of donkeys to the early Egyptian state and its ruler.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;
[[File:Wild Burros.jpg|thumb|[[Feral]] burros in [[Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area|Red Rock Canyon]]|left]]
By the end of the fourth millennium BC, the donkey had spread to Southwest Asia, and the main breeding center had shifted to [[Mesopotamia]] by 1800 BC. The breeding of large, white riding asses made [[Damascus]] famous{{Citation_needed|date=April 2016}}, while Syrian breeders developed at least three other breeds, including one preferred by women for its easy [[horse gait|gait]]. The Muscat or Yemen ass was developed in [[Arabia]]. By the second millennium BC, the donkey was brought to Europe, possibly at the same time as [[viticulture]] was introduced, as the donkey is associated with the Syrian god of wine, [[Dionysus]]. Greeks spread both of these to many of their colonies, including those in what are now Italy, France and Spain; Romans dispersed them throughout their empire.&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt;

The first donkeys came to the Americas on ships of the [[Christopher Columbus#Second voyage|Second Voyage]] of [[Christopher Columbus]], and were landed at [[Hispaniola]] in 1495.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; The first to reach North America may have been two animals taken to Mexico by [[Juan de Zumárraga]], the first bishop of Mexico, who arrived there on 6 December 1528, while the first donkeys to reach what is now the United States may have crossed the [[Rio Grande]] with [[Juan de Oñate]] in April 1598.&lt;ref name=burro/&gt; From that time on they spread northward, finding use in missions and mines. Donkeys were documented as present in what today is Arizona in 1679. By the [[Gold Rush]] years of the 19th century, the burro was the [[Pack animal|beast of burden]] of choice of early [[Prospecting|prospectors]] in the western United States. With the end of the [[placer mining]] boom, many of them escaped or were abandoned, and a [[Feral organism|feral]] population established itself.

==Present status==
About 41 million donkeys were reported worldwide in 2006.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; [[China]] had the most with 11 million, followed by [[Pakistan]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Mexico]]. As of 2017, however, the Chinese population was reported to have dropped to 3 million, with African populations under pressure as well, due to increasing trade and demand for donkey products in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41524710|title=Donkeys face 'biggest ever crisis'|last=Leithead|first=Alastair|date=2017-10-07|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers believe the actual number may be somewhat higher since many donkeys go uncounted.&lt;ref name="Starkey 1997"/&gt; The number of breeds and percentage of world population for each of the FAO's world regions was in 2006:&lt;ref name=mon /&gt;

In 1997 the number of donkeys in the world was reported to be continuing to grow, as it had steadily done throughout most of history; factors cited as contributing to this were increasing human population, progress in economic development and social stability in some poorer nations, conversion of forests to farm and range land, rising prices of motor vehicles and fuel, and the popularity of donkeys as pets.&lt;ref name="Starkey 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blench 2000"/&gt;
Since then, the world population of donkeys is reported to be rapidly shrinking, falling from 43.7 million to 43.5 million between 1995 and 2000, and to only 41 million in 2006.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; The fall in population is pronounced in developed countries; in Europe, the total number of donkeys fell from 3 million in 1944 to just over 1 million in 1994.&lt;ref name=svend5/&gt;

The Domestic Animal Diversity Information System ([[DAD-IS]]) of the [[FAO]] listed 189 breeds of ass in June 2011.&lt;ref name=dad/&gt; In 2000 the number of [[List of donkey breeds|breeds of donkey]] recorded worldwide was 97, and in 1995 it was 77. The rapid increase is attributed to attention paid to identification and recognition of donkey breeds by the FAO's Animal Genetic Resources project.&lt;ref name=mon/&gt; The rate of recognition of new breeds has been particularly high in some developed countries. In France, for example, only one breed, the Baudet de Poitou, was recognised prior to the early 1990s; by 2005, a further six donkey breeds had official recognition.&lt;ref name=inra/&gt;

In prosperous countries, the welfare of donkeys both at home and abroad has become a concern, and a number of sanctuaries for retired and rescued donkeys have been set up. The largest is [[The Donkey Sanctuary]] near Sidmouth, England, which also supports donkey welfare projects in Egypt, Ethiopia, India, [[Kenya]], and Mexico.&lt;ref name="DS 2006"/&gt;

==Uses==

===Economic use===
[[File:104 Donkeys in Tayrona Park Colombia.JPG|thumb|Donkeys bring supplies through the jungle to a camp outpost in [[Tayrona National Natural Park]] in northern [[Colombia]]]] [[File:Esel auf Ydra.jpg|thumb|On [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|the island of Hydra]], because cars are outlawed, donkeys and mules form virtually the sole method of heavy goods transport.]] [[File:Carisbrooke_Castle_well_house_3.jpg|thumb|A donkey operating a water well at [[Carisbrooke Castle]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].]]
The donkey has been used as a working animal for at least 5000 years. Of the more than 40 million donkeys in the world, about 96% are in [[underdeveloped]] countries, where they are used principally as pack animals or for draught work in transport or agriculture. After human labour, the donkey is the cheapest form of agricultural power.&lt;ref name=pearson/&gt; They may also be ridden, or used for threshing, raising water, milling and other work. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels.&lt;ref name=aluja/&gt; Some cultures that prohibit women from working with [[oxen]] in agriculture do not extend this taboo to donkeys, allowing them to be used by both sexes.&lt;ref name=ifad/&gt;

In developed countries where their use as beasts of burden has disappeared, donkeys are used to sire mules, to guard [[sheep]],&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt;&lt;ref name=dohner/&gt; for [[donkey rides]] for children or tourists, and as pets. Donkeys may be pastured or stabled with horses and ponies, and are thought to have a calming effect on nervous horses. If a donkey is introduced to a [[Mare (horse)|mare]] and [[foal]], the foal may turn to the donkey for support after it has been weaned from its mother.&lt;ref name=ypte/&gt;

A few donkeys are milked or raised for meat;&lt;ref name="Starkey 1997"/&gt; in Italy, which has the highest consumption of equine meat in Europe and where donkey meat is the main ingredient of several regional dishes, about 1000 donkeys were slaughtered in 2010, yielding approximately 100 tonnes of meat.&lt;ref name=istat/&gt; [[Asses' milk]] may command good prices: the average price in Italy in 2009 was €15 per litre,&lt;ref name=latte/&gt; and a price of €6 per 100 ml was reported from Croatia in 2008; it is used for soaps and cosmetics as well as dietary purposes. The niche markets for both milk and meat are expanding.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; In the past, donkey skin was used in the production of [[parchment]].&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; In 2017, the UK based charity [[The Donkey Sanctuary]] estimated that 1.8 million skins were traded every year, but the demand could be as high as 10 million.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-41524710|title=Why are donkeys facing their 'biggest ever crisis'?|last=Leithead|first=Alastair|date=7 October 2017|website=BBC News|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, donkey meat is considered a delicacy with some restaurants specializing in such dishes, and [[Guo Li Zhuang]] restaurants offer the genitals of donkeys in dishes. [[Donkey-hide gelatin]] is produced by soaking and stewing the hide to make a traditional Chinese medicine product. [[Donkey-hide gelatin|Ejiao]], the gelatine produced by boiling donkey skins, can sell for up to $388 per kilo, at October 2017 prices.

In 2017, a drop in the number of Chinese donkeys, combined with the fact that they are slow to reproduce, meant that Chinese suppliers began to look to Africa. As a result of the increase in demand, and the price that could be charged, [[Kenya]] opened three donkey abattoirs. Concerns for donkeys' well-being, however, have resulted in a number of African countries (including [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Botswana]], [[Niger]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mali]], and [[Senegal]]) banning China from buying their donkey products.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===In warfare===
During World War I [[John Simpson Kirkpatrick]], a British stretcher bearer serving with the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]], and Richard Alexander "Dick" Henderson of the [[New Zealand Medical Corps]] used donkeys to rescue wounded soldiers from the battlefield at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]].&lt;ref name=anzac/&gt;&lt;ref name=nzh/&gt;

According to British food writer [[Matthew Fort]], donkeys were used in the [[Italian Army]]. The Mountain Fusiliers each had a donkey to [[pack animal|carry]] their gear, and in extreme circumstances the animal could be [[horsemeat|eaten]].&lt;ref name=Vespa/&gt;

Donkeys have also been used to carry explosives in conflicts that include the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]] and others.&lt;ref name=evans/&gt;&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt;

==Care==

===Shoeing===
Donkey hooves are more elastic than those of horses, and do not naturally wear down as fast. Regular clipping may be required; neglect can lead to permanent damage.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; Working donkeys may need to be shod. Donkey shoes are similar to [[horseshoe]]s, but usually smaller and without toe-clips.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Nutrition===

In their native arid and semi-arid climates, donkeys spend more than half of each day foraging and feeding, often on poor quality scrub.&lt;ref name=svend2/&gt; The donkey has a tough [[digestive system]] in which roughage is efficiently broken down by [[hind gut fermentation]], microbial action in the [[caecum]] and [[large intestine]].&lt;ref name=svend2/&gt; While there is no marked structural difference between the gastro-intestinal tract of a donkey and that of a horse, the digestion of the donkey is more efficient. It needs less food than a horse or pony of comparable height and weight,&lt;ref name=smith2008/&gt; approximately 1.5 percent of body weight per day in dry matter,&lt;ref name=Wood2005/&gt; compared to the 2–2.5 percent consumption rate possible for a horse.&lt;ref name="Penn"&gt;[http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/FreePubs/pdfs/uc099.pdf Hall, Marvin H. and Patricia M. Comerford. "Pasture and Hay for Horses - Argonomy facts 32," 1992 University of Pennsylvania, Cooperative Extension Service.]  Web site accessed February 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Donkeys are also less prone to [[colic]].&lt;ref name=svendsen/&gt; The reasons for this difference are not fully understood; the donkey may have different [[intestinal flora]] to the horse, or a longer gut retention time.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

[[File:Baudet.jpg|thumb|[[Baudet de Poitou|Poitou donkeys]].]]
Donkeys obtain most of their energy from [[Dietary fiber|structural carbohydrates]]. Some suggest that a donkey needs to be fed only [[straw]] (preferably barley straw), supplemented with controlled grazing in the summer or [[hay]] in the winter,&lt;ref name=sanct/&gt; to get all the energy, protein, fat and vitamins it requires; others recommend some grain to be fed, particularly to working animals,&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; and others advise against feeding straw.&lt;ref name=blm/&gt;   They do best when allowed to consume small amounts of food over long periods. They can meet their nutritional needs on 6 to 7 hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought. If they are worked long hours or do not have access to pasture, they require hay or a similar dried forage, with no more than a 1:4 ratio of legumes to grass.  They also require salt and mineral supplements, and access to clean, fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;Aganga, A.A., ''et al.'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928063807/http://www.cipav.org.co/lrrd/lrrd12/2/agan122.htm "Feeding donkeys"] ''Livestock Research for Rural Development'' 12 (2) 2000. Department of Animal Science and Production, Botswana College of Agriculture. Web site accessed July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In temperate climates the forage available is often too abundant and too rich; over-feeding may cause weight gain and obesity, and lead to metabolic disorders such as founder ([[laminitis]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071119104524/http://www.dengie.com/pages/feeding-horses/nutritional-advice/feeding-your-donkey.php "Feeding Your Donkey"]  Web site accessed July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[hyperlipaemia]],&lt;ref name=sanct/&gt; or to [[gastric ulcers]].&lt;ref name=Burden2009/&gt;

Throughout the world, working donkeys are associated with the very poor, with those living at or below subsistence level.&lt;ref name=aluja/&gt; Few receive adequate food, and in general donkeys throughout the [[Third World]] are under-nourished and over-worked.&lt;ref name=svend4/&gt;

==Burro==
[[File:DonkeyCartCarnHuejot2.JPG|thumb|A burro pulling a cart during the [[Carnival of Huejotzingo]]]]
In the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Americas]], a '''{{lang|es|burro}}''' is a small donkey.  The Domestic Animal Diversity Information System ([[DAD-IS]]) of the [[FAO]] lists the burro as a specific breed of ass.&lt;ref name="dadburro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dad.fao.org/cgi-bin/EfabisWeb.cgi?sid=1b9408faaf38cf3a67973ce670aa7736,reportsreport13_50000044 |title=Breeds from species: Ass |website=Domestic Animal Diversity Information System |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) |accessdate=April 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mexico]], the donkey population is estimated at three million.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;Garcia-Navarro, Lourdes (8 May 2005) [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4635078 "Celebrating the Burro in Mexico"] (transcript of radio broadcast). Accessed February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also substantial ''burro'' populations in [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Nicaragua]].

''Burro'' is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for donkey. In Spanish, burros may also be called ''{{lang|es|burro {{sic|mexicano|hide=y|reason=Adjectival forms of nationalities are not capitalized in Spanish}}}}'' ('Mexican donkey'), ''{{lang|es|burro criollo}}'' ('[[Criollo people|Criollo]] donkey'), or ''{{lang|es|burro criollo {{sic|mexicano|hide=y|reason=Adjectival forms of nationalities are not capitalized in Spanish}}}}''. In the United States, "burro" is used as a [[Loanword|loan word]] by English speakers to describe any small donkey used primarily as a pack animal, as well as to describe the [[Feral organism|feral]] donkeys that live in [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Oregon]], [[Utah]], [[Texas]] and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="blm" /&gt;

Among donkeys, burros tend to be on the small side. A study of working burros in central Mexico found a weight range of {{convert|50|–|186|kg}}, with an average weight of {{convert|122|kg|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|112|kg|abbr=on}} for females. Height at the [[withers]] varied from {{convert|87|–|120|cm|abbr=on}}, with an average of approximately {{convert|108|cm|abbr=on}}, and girth measurements ranged from {{convert|88|–|152|cm|abbr=on}}, with an average of about {{convert|120|cm|abbr=on}}. The average age of the burros in the study was 6.4 years; evaluated by their [[horse teeth|teeth]], they ranged from 1 to 17 years old.&lt;ref name="aluja" /&gt; They are gray in color. Mexican burros tend to be smaller than their counterparts in the USA, which are both larger and more robust. To strengthen their bloodstock, in May 2005, the state of [[Jalisco]] imported 11 male and female donkeys from Kentucky.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

==Feral donkeys and wild asses==
In some areas domestic donkeys have returned to the wild and established [[feral]] populations such as those of the [[Burro]] of North America and the [[Asinara donkey]] of [[Sardinia]], Italy, both of which have protected status. Feral donkeys can also cause problems, notably in environments that have evolved free of any form of [[equid]], such as Hawaii.&lt;ref name="feral"/&gt; In Australia, where there may be 5 million [[Feral donkeys in Australia|feral donkeys]],&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; they are regarded as an invasive pest and have a serious impact on the environment. They may compete with livestock and native animals for resources, spread weeds and diseases, foul or damage watering holes and cause erosion.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt;

===Wild asses, onagers, and kiangs===
Few species of ass exist in the wild. The [[African wild ass]], ''Equus africanus'', has two subspecies, the [[Equus africanus somaliensis|Somali wild ass]], ''Equus africanus somaliensis'', and the [[Equus africanus africanus|Nubian wild ass]], ''Equus africanus africanus'',&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; the principal ancestor of the domestic donkey.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; Both are critically endangered.&lt;ref name=iucn2/&gt; Extinct species include the [[European ass]], ''Equus hydruntinus'', which became extinct during the [[Neolithic]], and the [[Equus africanus atlanticus|North African wild ass]], ''Equus africanus atlanticus'', which became extinct in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt;

There are five subspecies of Asiatic wild ass or [[onager]], ''Equus hemionus'', and three subspecies of the [[kiang]], ''Equus kiang'', of the Himalayan upland.

==Donkey hybrids==
A male donkey (jack) can be crossed with a female horse to produce a [[mule]]. A male horse can be crossed with a female donkey to produce a [[hinny]].

Horse-donkey [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] are almost always [[infertility|sterile]] because horses have 64 [[chromosome]]s whereas donkeys have 62, producing offspring with 63 chromosomes. Mules are much more common than hinnies. This is believed to be caused by two factors, the first being proven in cat hybrids, that when the chromosome count of the male is the higher, fertility rates drop (as in the case of stallion x jenney). {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The lower progesterone production of the jenny may also lead to early embryonic loss. In addition, there are reasons not directly related to reproductive biology. Due to different [[mating]] behavior, jacks are often more willing to cover mares than stallions are to breed jennys. Further, mares are usually larger than jennys and thus have more room for the ensuing foal to grow in the womb, resulting in a larger animal at birth. It is commonly believed that mules are more easily handled and also physically stronger than hinnies, making them more desirable for breeders to produce.{{Citation needed|reason=to make this statement, one needs data indicating the greater prevalence of mules|date=August 2009}}

The offspring of a [[zebra]]-donkey cross is called a zonkey, [[zebroid]], zebrass, or zedonk;&lt;ref name=zorse/&gt; ''zebra mule'' is an older term, but still used in some regions today. The foregoing terms generally refer to hybrids produced by breeding a male zebra to a female donkey. ''Zebra hinny, zebret'' and ''zebrinny'' all refer to the cross of a female zebra with a male donkey. Zebrinnies are rarer than zedonkies because female zebras in captivity are most valuable when used to produce full-blooded zebras.&lt;ref name=zedonk/&gt; There are not enough female zebras breeding in captivity to spare them for hybridizing; there is no such limitation on the number of female donkeys breeding.

==Cultural references==
The long history of human donkey use has created a rich store of cultural references:

===Religion, myth and folklore===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Procession in the Streets of Jerusalem (Le cortège dans les rues de Jérusalem) - James Tissot.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Jesus]] rode on a donkey in his [[triumphal entry into Jerusalem]]]]
Due to its widespread domestication and use, the donkey is referred to in myth and folklore around the world.  In classical and ancient cultures, donkeys had a part. The donkey was the symbol of the Egyptian sun god [[Ra]] .&lt;ref name=gauding/&gt; In [[Greek myth]], [[Silenus]] is pictured in Classical Antiquity and during the Renaissance (''illustration, left'') drunken and riding a donkey, and [[Midas]] was given the ears of an ass after misjudging a musical competition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Donkeys (or asses) are mentioned many times in the [[Bible]], beginning in the first book and continuing through both [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s, so they became part of Judeo-Christian tradition. They are portrayed as work animals, used for agricultural purposes, transport and as beasts of burden, and terminology is used to differentiate age and gender. In contrast, horses were represented only in the context of war, ridden by [[cavalry]] or pulling [[chariot]]s. Owners were protected by law from loss caused by the death or injury of a donkey, showing their value in that time period. Narrative turning points in the Bible (and other stories) are often marked through the use of donkeys&amp;nbsp;— for instance, leading, saddling, or mounting/dismounting a donkey are used to show a change in focus or a decision having been made.&lt;ref name=forti/&gt; They are used as a measure of wealth in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 30:43,&lt;ref name=genesis/&gt; and in Genesis chapter 34, the prince of [[Shechem]] (the modern [[Nablus]]) is named Hamor ("donkey" in Hebrew).&lt;ref name=gen34/&gt;

[[File:Piero di Cosimo - La Découverte du miel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Silenus on a donkey, detail from ''The Discovery of Honey'' (c. 1500) by [[Piero di Cosimo]]]]
According to Old Testament prophecy, the [[Messiah]] is said to arrive on a donkey: "Behold, your King is coming to you; He is just and having salvation, Lowly and riding on a donkey, A colt, the foal of a donkey!" ([[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 9:9). According to the New Testament, this prophecy was fulfilled when [[Jesus]] entered [[Jerusalem]] riding on the animal ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 21:4-7, [[Gospel of John|John]] 12:14-15). Jesus appeared to be aware of this connection (Matthew 21:1-3, John 12:16).

In the [[Jewish]] religion, the donkey is not a [[kosher]] animal. In the [[Zohar]], it is considered ''avi avot hatuma'' or the ultimate impure animal, and doubly "[[Unclean animals|impure]]", as it is both non-ruminant and non-cloven hoofed. However, it is the only impure animal that falls under the [[mitzvah]] (commandment) of firstborn  ("[[bechor]]") consecration that also applies to humans and pure animals (See [[Petter Chamor]]). In Jewish [[Talmud|Oral Tradition]] ([[Talmud Bavli]]), the [[Messiah|son of David]] was prophesied as riding on a donkey if the [[Israelites#Biblical Israel|tribes of Israel]] are undeserving of redemption.&lt;ref name=morrison/&gt;

In contemporary [[Israel]], the term "[[The Messiah's Donkey|Messiah's Donkey]]" (Chamoro Shel Mashiach חמורו של משיח) stands at the center of a controversial religious-political doctrine, under which it was the Heavenly-imposed "task" of secular [[Zionists]] to build up a [[Jewish State]], but once the state is established they are fated to give place to [[Orthodox Jews|the Religious]] who are ordained to lead the state. The secularists in this analogy are "The Donkey" while the religious who are fated to supplant them are a collective "Messiach". A book on the subject, published in 1998 by the militant secularist Sefi Rechlevsky, aroused a major controversy in the Israeli public opinion.&lt;ref name=wurm/&gt;

With the rise of Christianity, some believers came to see the cross-shaped marking present on donkeys' backs and shoulders as a symbol of the animal's bearing Jesus into [[Jerusalem]] on [[Palm Sunday]].  During the Middle Ages, Europeans used hairs from this cross (or contact with a donkey) as [[folk remedies]] to treat illness, including [[measles]] and [[whooping cough]].&lt;ref name=oliver/&gt; Around 1400 AD, one physician listed riding backwards on a donkey as a cure for [[scorpion]] stings.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt;

[[File:Kalratri Sanghasri 2010 Arnab Dutta.JPG|thumb|upright|Goddess [[Kalaratri]] rides a donkey.]]
Donkeys are also referred to repeatedly in the writings and imagery of the [[Hinduism]], where the goddess [[Kalaratri]]'s [[vahana]] (vehicle) is a donkey.&lt;ref name=gaen/&gt; Donkeys also appear multiple times in Indian folklore as the subject of stories in both the [[Hitopadesha]]&lt;ref name=muller/&gt; and the [[Panchatantra]].&lt;ref name=purn/&gt;

In Islam, eating the meat of a domestic donkey is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=86563 Eating meat of a donkey and giraffe]," [[IslamWeb.net]], 2003-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature and film===
Donkeys hold a significant place in literature, especially in Western cultures. The original representations of donkeys in Western literature come mainly from the [[Bible]] and [[Ancient Greece]]. Donkeys were represented in a fairly negative form by the Greeks, but perceptions later changed, partially due to donkeys becoming increasingly symbolically connected to Christianity. Donkeys were found in the works of [[Homer]], [[Aesop]] and [[Apuleius]], where they were generally portrayed as stupid and stubborn, or servile at best, and generally represented the [[Proletariat|lower class]]. They were often contrasted with horses, which were seen as powerful and beautiful. Aesop's ''[[The Ass in the Lion's Skin]]'', representational of the almost 20 of his fables that portray donkeys, shows the donkey as a fool. Apuleius's ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' (160 AD), where the narrator is turned into a donkey, is also notable for its portrayal of donkeys as stubborn, foolish, wicked and lowly. This work had a large influence on the portrayal of donkeys in later cultures, including medieval and renaissance Europe. During this time, donkeys continued to be shown as stupid, clumsy and slow. [[Shakespeare]] popularized the use of the word "ass" as an insult meaning stupid or clownish in many of his plays, including Bottom's appearance in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1600). In contrast, a few years later, [[Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' shows a more positive slant on the donkey, primarily as [[Sancho Panza]]'s mount, portraying them as steady and loyal companions. This difference is possibly due to donkeys being an important aspect of many Spaniards' lives at this point in time.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt;

In contrast to Grecian works, donkeys were portrayed in Biblical works as symbols of service, suffering, peace and humility. They are also associated with the theme of wisdom in the [[Old Testament]] story of [[Balaam]]'s ass, and are seen in a positive light through the story of [[Jesus]] riding into [[Jerusalem]] on a donkey. By the 19th century, the donkey was portrayed with more positive attributes by popular authors. [[William Wordsworth]] portrayed the donkey as loyal and patient in his 1819 poem ''[[Peter Bell (Wordsworth)|Peter Bell:A Tale]]'', using the donkey as a Christian symbol. [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] in ''[[Travels with a Donkey]]'' (1879), portrays the animal as a stubborn beast of burden. Sympathetic portrayals return in [[Juan Ramon Jimenez]]'s ''[[Platero and I]].'' The melancholy [[Eeyore]] in ''[[Winnie the Pooh]]'' (first published in 1926) is arguably the most famous donkey in Western literature.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt;

Donkeys were featured in literature during the 20th century, including in [[George Orwell]]'s 1951 ''[[Animal Farm]]'', where [[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]] the donkey is portrayed as resilient and loyal.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt;  [[Puzzle (Narnia)|Puzzle]] is a well-meaning but easily manipulated donkey in [[C. S. Lewis]]'s 1956 ''[[The Last Battle]]''.&lt;ref name=mish/&gt; Brighty is the central character of the 1953 children's novel and 1967 film ''[[Brighty of the Grand Canyon]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}  Donkeys are portrayed in film including the 1940 [[Disney]] film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', where the donkey is portrayed as a [[slapstick comedy|slapstick]] character who participates in a social faux pas with [[Bacchus]] and is punished by [[Zeus]].&lt;ref name=clague/&gt; A donkey is featured as the main figure in the 1966 film ''[[Au hasard Balthazar]]'' by [[Robert Bresson]], and, is given a life path of Christian symbolism.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt; [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], voiced by [[Eddie Murphy]], is featured as a main character in the ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' franchise of the 2000s.&lt;ref name=shrek/&gt;

===Colloquialisms, proverbs and insults===
Many cultures have colloquialisms and [[proverb]]s that include donkeys or asses. British phrases include "to talk the hind legs off a donkey", used to describe someone talking excessively and generally persuasively.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; Donkeys are the animals featured most often in Greek proverbs, including such statements of fatalistic resignation as "the donkey lets the rain soak him".&lt;ref name=ehren/&gt; The French philosopher [[Jean Buridan]] constructed the paradox called [[Buridan's ass]], in which a donkey, placed exactly midway between water and food, would die of hunger and thirst because he could not find a reason to choose one of the options over the other, and so would never make a decision.&lt;ref name=phrase/&gt; Italy has several phrases regarding donkeys, including "put your money in the ass of a donkey and they'll call him sir" (meaning, if you're rich, you'll get respect) and "women, donkeys and goats all have heads" (meaning, women are as stubborn as donkeys and goats).&lt;ref name=melfi/&gt;  The United States developed its own expressions, including "better a donkey that carries me than a horse that throws me", "a donkey looks beautiful to a donkey", and "a donkey is but a donkey though laden with gold", among others.&lt;ref name=meider/&gt; From Afghanistan, we find the [[Pashto language|Pashto]] proverb, "Even if a donkey goes to [[Mecca]], he is still a donkey." In Ethiopia, there are many [[Amharic]] proverbs that demean donkeys, such as, "The heifer that spends time with a donkey learns to fart" (Bad company corrupts good morals).

The words "donkey" and "ass" (or translations thereof) have come to have derogatory or insulting meaning in several languages, and are generally used to mean someone who is obstinate, stupid or silly,&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;&lt;ref name=dict2/&gt;&lt;ref name=long/&gt;&lt;ref name=rfe/&gt; In [[football (soccer)|football]], especially in the United Kingdom, a player who is considered unskilful is often dubbed a "donkey",&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt; and the term has a similar connotation in [[poker]].&lt;ref  name=bochan/&gt; In the US, the slang terms "dumbass" and "jackass" are used to refer to someone considered stupid.&lt;ref name=dict3/&gt;&lt;ref name=dict4/&gt;

===Politics===
[[File:The W(estminster) just-asses a braying - or - the downfall of the E. O. table by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|right|Satirical use of braying in a political cartoon]]
[[File:Democraticjackass.jpg|thumb|The [[Thomas Nast]] political cartoon that introduced the donkey as the mascot of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]]]
In keeping with their widespread cultural references, donkeys feature in political systems, symbols and terminology in many areas of the world. A "[[donkey vote]]" is a vote that simply writes down preferences in the order of the candidates (1 at the top, then 2, and so on), and is most often seen in countries with [[ranked voting systems]] and [[compulsory voting]], such as Australia.&lt;ref name=abc2/&gt; The donkey is a common symbol of the [[Democratic Party of the United States]], originating in a [[cartoon]] by [[Thomas Nast]] of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=nast/&gt;

The bray of the donkey may be used as a [[simile]] for loud and foolish speech in political [[Derision|mockery]].&lt;ref name=tel/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; For example,&lt;ref name=tryon/&gt;{{quote|There are braying men in the world as well as braying asses; for what's loud and senseless talking and swearing, any other than braying|[[Roger L'Estrange|Sir Roger L'Estrange]]}}
In 1963, [[Party of Donkeys]], a frivolous political party was founded in [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milani|first1=Abbas|title=Eminent Persians: The Men and Women who Made Modern Iran, 1941-1979|volume=1|date=2008|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, N.Y.|isbn=978-0815609070|pages=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "''ruc català''" or "''burro català''" ([[Catalan donkey]]) has become a [[Catalan symbols|symbol of Catalonia]] in Spain. In 2003 some friends in Catalonia made bumper stickers featuring the ''burro català'' as a reaction against a national advertising campaign for ''Toro d'Osborne'', a brandy. The burro became popular as a nationalist symbol in Catalonia, whose residents wanted to assert their identity to resist Spanish [[centralism]]. Renewed attention to the regional burro helped start a breeding campaign for its preservation, and its numbers have increased.&lt;ref name=mont/&gt;

[[Proshka]], an ass owned by Russian populist nationalist liberal democratic politician [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]], became prominent during the [[Russian presidential election, 2012|2012 Russian presidential election]] campaign, when he was filmed in an election advertisement video. In that controversial ad, Zhirinovsky appeared sitting in a [[sleigh]] harnessed with Proshka, then claiming that the "little wretched ass" is the symbol of Russia and that if he would become [[President of Russia|President]] a "daring [[troika harness|troika]]" would return as a [[List of cultural icons of Russia|symbol of Russia]] instead of the ass; at the end, Zhirinovsky beat Proshka with a [[whip]], made the ass move and had a ride on him through the snow-covered backyard of his [[dacha]]. International organisations [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) and [[World Animal Protection]] have accused Zhirinovsky of [[cruelty to animals]]. Zhirinovsky replied to the assertions by stating that similar treatment is commonplace in the [[Arab world]] and claimed that his ass has been treated "better than many people".&lt;ref name=ass-defenders&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nr2.ru/election/371706.html|title=Страница не найдена|publisher=|access-date=March 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516165143/http://www.nr2.ru/election/371706.html|archive-date=May 16, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence demonstrates that that gun at that scene had been passed to Mark Duggan by this defendant, [[Kevin Hutchinson-Foster]], shortly before the [[minicab]] in which Mark Duggan was travelling was stopped by police in Ferry Lane in Tottenham Hale. There in Ferry Lane Mark Duggan was shot and fatally injured by the police as a result of his possession of that gun and what he was thought to be about to do with it. The firearm was a BBM Bruni Model 92 [[handgun]]. It had been modified so that it would fire 9mm bullets - a lethal firearm as you will hear.
The charge this defendant faces is the supply or transfer of that gun to Mark Duggan."

===R v Jogee===
In February 2016, Brown was interviewed by [[The Lawyer]] magazine to analyse [[R v Jogee]] that reversed previous case law on [[joint enterprise]] murder,{{Quote box|width=25%|align=left|bgcolor=#E6E6FA|quote="The appeals by these two men have been used by the Supreme Court to address the problem and change the law. Though they might well have kept the law as it was.There will now be very many cases of applications to appeal against convictions out of time. They won’t be confined to murder cases, but to all crime where there was a secondary party, so robberies, sexual crimes. That doesn’t mean every case of so-called joint enterprise will be overturned, the justices have been pretty strong on that, particularly because the Court of Appeal on accepts cases out of time when there has been a serious injustice to a party. From today it doesn’t automatically become a crime if you prove foresight by the secondary party. It’s been found too low a test to be found guilty of a serious crime, but it is still available for a jury to use in deciding whether or not the party intended to encourage or assist the other to do it."|source=— '''Edward Brown QC'''"&lt;ref name="“The Lawyer"/&gt;}} after a recent [[Supreme Court]] ruling indicating that it was not right that a person could be convicted of murder and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment if they foresaw the murder could take place but did not deliver the fatal blow.&lt;ref name="“The Lawyer"&gt;{{cite news |title=R v Jogee Ruling |url=https://l2b.thelawyer.com/kinders-casebook-landmark-ruling-reinterprets-law-of-joint-enterprise/  |accessdate=26 July 2017 |date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown commented: "It has always been the case that a person who intentionally assists another in a joint crime will be as guilty as the person who physically commits that crime. After the Chan Wing-Siu ruling in 1985, juries have since been directed that if a secondary party foresaw that the principal party might use a knife, for example, with intent to cause harm or murder, then they are guilty of murder as well."&lt;ref name="“The Lawyer"/&gt;
Brown also commented that the judgment in [[R v Jogee]] and [[Ruddock v The Queen]]  will have a significant effect on the prosecution of multi-handed crime, and in particular cases of multi-handed serious violence that sometimes results in death. It will also result in many applications for leave to appeal against conviction out of time.&lt;ref name="“Lexis Nexis"&gt;{{cite news |title=Supreme Court rules on ‘joint enterprise’|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/lexispsl/corporatecrime/document/412012/5J5P-M4H1-DYW7-W245-00000-00/Supreme_Court_rules_on__joint_enterprise_  |accessdate=26 July 2017 |date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Brown started prosecuting Hamad Mohammad and three of his associates who were accused of [[joint enterprise|joint enterprise murder]].

===Gintare Suminaite===
In January 2017 Brown prosecuted Gintare Suminaite, 29-year-old mother from [[Crawley]], [[West Sussex]], who was charged with murder of her newborn child.&lt;ref name="“Metro 1"&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Tragic’ mother who killed her baby is spared jail |url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/01/31/tragic-mother-who-killed-her-baby-is-spared-jail-6416647/ |accessdate=25 July 2017 |date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suminaite told police she "most likely" intended to kill her baby, but said she did not know why. At the trial held at the Old Bailey she pleaded guilty to a charge of infanticide.&lt;ref name="“Express 1"/&gt;
The court heard that on April 5, 2016, Suminaite left work early saying she had ‘big problems’ and gave birth in the bathroom at home, with her partner in another room.&lt;ref name="“IifeNews"&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman Who Killed Her Newborn Baby Girl Minutes After Birth Won’t Go to Prison |url=http://www.lifenews.com/2017/02/01/woman-who-killed-her-newborn-baby-girl-minutes-after-birth-wont-go-to-prison/ |accessdate=4 August 2017 |date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her partner found Suminaite lying naked in the bathroom surrounded by blood and a baby bath full of what appeared to be clothes.&lt;ref name="“The Argus"&gt;{{cite news |title=High Court judge may be called in to hear baby death case |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/14423777.High_Court_judge_may_be_called_in_to_hear_baby_death_case/ |accessdate=4 August 2017 |date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall was arrested after the victim's relative found hidden footage of killing on his [[laptop]].&lt;ref name="Metro.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Computer repairman ‘terrorised and killed by fake policeman during bondage |url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/31/computer-repairman-terrorised-and-killed-by-fake-policeman-during-bondage-6818943/ |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Fasoli, a 58-year-old [[IT]] expert,&lt;ref name="Attitude.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jason Marshall, 28, is accused of killing IT expert Peter Fasoli during a hook-up before setting his flat alight. |url=http://attitude.co.uk/nephew-found-footage-of-uncles-hook-up-app-murder-two-years-after-believing-he-died-in-fire/ |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Northolt]] was terrorised and murdered in 2013 at his own house by Marshall who posed as a policeman.&lt;ref name="London Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |title=Murder suspect caught after victim's relative finds hidden footage of killing |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/31/murder-suspect-caught-victims-relative-finds-hidden-footage/ |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the opening day of his trial at the [[Old Bailey]], Marshall was described as a "calculating and determined" killer.&lt;ref name="DailyRecord.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jason Marshall, 28, calmly stood over the body of Peter Fasoli and pronounced "in the name of the father, the son and the Holy Ghost" in Latin. |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/no-no-please-court-hears-10907646 |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecuting, Mr Brown warned jurors that they would be asked to view the video, which showed the actual killing itself.&lt;ref name="London DailyMail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Computer repairman filmed his own death as fantasist, 28, terrorised and murdered him during a bondage session while listening to Classic FM |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4746834/Fantasist-killer-caught-camera-murdering-partner.html |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court heard that during sexual roleplay, Marshall stripped the victim and arrested him for “being a spy” and hacking into a government laptop, the court heard.

"The fire, in the early hours of January 7, 2013, had been intended to hide a terrible crime. The fire was set by this defendant in an attempt to disguise what truly happened, and the defendant Jason Marshall very nearly succeeded in escaping justice. Peter Fasoli was killed, intentionally. He had been subjected to a calculated and determined attack, by this defendant whom he invited into his home. In the end he literally fought for his life but by the time Mr Fasoli fully understood the true motives of the person who had tricked his way into his home, it was too late. Desperate as his attempts were, he could do nothing - as you will all too graphically come to understand."

But two years later when Fasoli's nephew was sorting through his belongings, he was horrified to discover a computer file containing [[CCTV]] footage of the entire event.&lt;ref name="ITV News"&gt;{{cite news |title=28-year-old on trial for 2013 Northolt murder |url=http://www.itv.com/news/london/2017-07-31/28-year-old-on-trial-for-2013-northolt-murder/ |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The court heard how Marshall, who denied murder, first got in contact with Peter Fasoli in December 2012 through gay social networking site called [[Badoo]], inviting to set up a treesome and inventing the persona of a policeman.&lt;ref name="NewhamRecorder"&gt;{{cite news |title=East Ham murder accused ‘set fire to victim’s home to cover up death’, court hears |url=http://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/crime-court/east-ham-murder-accused-set-fire-to-victim-s-home-to-cover-up-death-court-hears-1-5129121 |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prosecuting, Mr Brown told jurors:
{{quote|There is a telling feature of this case - whilst the defendant sought to tempt the deceased into thinking their encounter that night was to be sexual in nature, the sexual element of the night’s events played only a short part early on and soon was superseded by physical domination and then violence.&lt;ref name="NewhamRecorder"/&gt;}}
The Old Baily heard that Marshall arrived at the Fasoli's home at around 7pm on 6 January 2012, pretending to be a police officer kitted out with a police utility belt, handcuffs and a pistol holster.&lt;ref name="London Independent"&gt;{{cite news |title=Murder victim inadvertently filmed his own death during bondage sex game |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/bondage-sex-game-murder-victim-film-death-peter-fasoli-london-northolt-fake-policeman-classic-fm-a7871291.html?amp |accessdate=1 August 2017 |date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[business model]] illustrates the functions associated with a process that are performance and the organizations that perform these functions. In software development often both [[business process model]]s and [[data model]]s are being developed as part of the process of creating application programs on the one side and [[database]]s on the other side.&lt;ref name="SS93"&gt;Paul R. Smith &amp; Richard Sarfaty (1993). [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/servlets/purl/10160331-YhIRrY/ Creating a strategic plan for configuration management using Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools.] Paper For 1993 National DOE/Contractors and Facilities CAD/CAE User's Group.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Enterprise modelling''' is the abstract representation, description and definition of the structure, processes, information and resources of an identifiable [[business]], [[government]] body, or other large organization.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius T. Leondes, Richard Henry Frymuth Jackson (1992). ''Manufacturing and Automation Systems: Techniques and Technologies''. Academic Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-12-012745-8}}, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

It deals with the process of understanding an organization and improving its performance through creation and analysis of enterprise models. This includes the modelling of the relevant business domain (usually relatively stable), [[business process modeling|business process]]es (usually more volatile), and uses of [[information technology]] within the business domain and its processes.

== Overview ==
Enterprise modelling is the process of building [[business model|model]]s of whole or part of an [[Business|enterprise]] with [[process model]]s, [[data model]]s, [[resource model]]s and or new [[ontologies]] etc. It is based on knowledge about the enterprise, previous models and/or [[reference model]]s as well as domain ontologies using model representation languages.&lt;ref name="Vern97"&gt;[[François Vernadat|F.B. Vernadat]] (1997). [http://www.mel.nist.gov/workshop/iceimt97/pap-ver3/pap-ver3.htm Enterprise Modelling Languages ICEIMT'97 Enterprise Integration - International Consensus]. EI-IC ESPRIT Project 21.859.&lt;/ref&gt; An enterprise in general is a unit of economic organization or activity. These activities are required to develop and deliver [[Product (business)|product]]s and/or [[Service (economics)|services]] to a customer. An enterprise includes a number of functions and operations such as purchasing, manufacturing, marketing, finance, engineering, and research and development. The enterprise of interest are those corporate functions and operations necessary to manufacture current and potential future variants of a product.&lt;ref name="Ostie96"&gt;James K. Ostie (1996). [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/432930-yXrz5I/webviewable/432930.PDF "An Introduction to Enterprise Modeling and Simulation"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "enterprise model" is used in industry to represent differing enterprise representations, with no real standardized definition.&lt;ref&gt;E. Aranow (1991). "Modeling Exercises Shape Up Enterprises". In: ''Software Magazine'' Vol.11, p. 36-43&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the complexity of enterprise organizations, a vast number of differing enterprise modelling approaches have been pursued across industry and academia.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Pétrie Jr. (1992). "Introduction", In: ''Enterprise Integration Modeling - Proceedings of the First International Conference'' MIT Press, p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt; Enterprise modelling constructs can focus upon manufacturing operations and/or business operations; however, a common thread in enterprise modelling is an inclusion of assessment of information technology. For example, the use of networked computers to trigger and receive replacement orders along a material supply chain is an example of how information technology is used to coordinate manufacturing operations within an enterprise.&lt;ref name="Ostie96"/&gt;

The basic idea of enterprise modelling according to [[Ulrich Frank]]&lt;ref name="FU09"&gt;[http://www.wi-inf.uni-due.de/FGFrank/index.php?lang=en&amp;&amp;groupId=1&amp;&amp;contentType=ResearchInterest&amp;&amp;topicId=14 "Enterprise modeling"] by [[Ulrich Frank]] (2009) at wi-inf.uni-due.de. Retrieved May 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is "to offer different [[View model|views]] on an enterprise, thereby providing a medium to foster dialogues between various [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] - both in academia and in practice. For this purpose they include abstractions suitable for [[strategic planning]], [[Business process reengineering|organisational (re-) design]] and [[software engineering]]. The views should complement each other and thereby foster a better understanding of [[complex system]]s by systematic abstractions. The views should be generic in the sense that they can be applied to any enterprise. At the same time they should offer abstractions that help with designing [[information systems]] which are well integrated with a company's long term strategy and its organisation. Hence, [[enterprise model]]s can be regarded as the conceptual infrastructure that support a high level of integration."&lt;ref name="FU09"/&gt;

== History ==
Enterprise modelling has its roots in [[systems modelling]] and especially information systems modelling. One of the earliest pioneering works in modelling information systems was done by Young and Kent (1958),&lt;ref&gt;Young, J. W., and Kent, H. K. (1958). "Abstract Formulation of Data Processing Problems". In: ''Journal of Industrial Engineering''. Nov-Dec 1958. 9(6), pp. 471-479&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JAB07"&gt;[[Janis A. Bubenko jr]] (2007) "From Information Algebra to Enterprise Modelling and Ontologies - a Historical Perspective on Modelling for Information Systems". In: ''Conceptual Modelling in Information Systems Engineering''. [[:w:John Krogstie|John Krogstie]] et al. eds. pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt; who argued for "a precise and abstract way of specifying the informational and time characteristics of a [[data processing]] problem". They wanted to create "a notation that should enable the [[Systems analyst|analyst]] to organize the problem around any piece of [[computer hardware|hardware]]". Their work was a first effort to create an abstract specification and invariant basis for designing different alternative implementations using different hardware components. A next step in IS modelling was taken by [[CODASYL]], an IT industry consortium formed in 1959, who essentially aimed at the same thing as Young and Kent: the development of "a proper structure for machine independent problem definition language, at the system level of data processing". This led to the development of a specific IS [[information algebra]].&lt;ref name="JAB07"/&gt;

The first methods dealing with enterprise modelling emerged in the 1970s. They were the [[Entity-relationship model|entity-relationship approach]] of [[Peter Chen]] (1976) and [[SADT]] of [[Douglas T. Ross]] (1977), the one concentrate on the [[information view]] and the other on the [[function view]] of business entities.&lt;ref name="Vern97"/&gt; These first methods have been followed end 1970s by numerous methods for [[software engineering]], such as [[SSADM]], [[Structured Design]], [[Structured Analysis]] and others. Specific methods for enterprise modelling in the context of [[Computer Integrated Manufacturing]] appeared in the early 1980s. They include the [[IDEF]] family of methods (ICAM, 1981) and the [[GRAI method]] by [[Guy Doumeingts]] in 1984&lt;ref&gt;[[Doumeingts, Guy]] (1984) ''La Méthode GRAI''. PhD. Thesis, University of Bordeaux I, Bordeaux, France. (In French).&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[GRAI/GIM]] by Doumeingts and others in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Doumeingts|Doumeingts, G.]], [[Bruno Vallespir|Vallespir, B.]], Zanettin, M. and Chen, D. (1992) ''GIM, GRAI Integrated Methodology - A methodology for Designing CIM systems, Version 1.0''. Unnumbered Report, LAP/GRAI, University of Bordeaux I, France&lt;/ref&gt;

These second generation of methods were activity-based methods which have been surpassed on the one hand by process-centred modelling methods developed in the 1990s such as [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems]] (ARIS), [[CIMOSA]] and [[Integrated Enterprise Modeling]] (IEM). And on the other hand by [[Object-Oriented Modeling|object-oriented methods]], such as [[Object-oriented analysis and design|Object-oriented analysis]] (OOA) and [[Object-modeling technique|Object-modelling technique]] (OMT).&lt;ref name="Vern97"/&gt;

== Enterprise modelling basics ==
=== Enterprise model ===
An enterprise model is a representation of the structure, activities, processes, information, resources, people, behavior, goals, and constraints of a business, government, or other enterprises.&lt;ref name="FG98"&gt;[[Mark S. Fox]] and [[Michael Gruninger]] (1998) "[http://www.eil.utoronto.ca/enterprise-modelling/papers/fox-aimag98.pdf Enterprise Modeling]". American Association for Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Naylor]] (1970) defined a (simulation) model as "an attempt to describe the interrelationships among a corporation's financial, marketing, and production activities in terms of a set of mathematical and logical relationships which are programmed into the computer."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Naylor|Naylor, T.]] (1970) Corporate simulation models and the economic theory of the firm, in Schrieber, A. (editor) "Corporate simulation models", University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1970, pp 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt; These interrelationships should according to Gershefski (1971) represent in detail all aspects of the firm including "the physical operations of the company, the accounting and financial practices followed, and the response to investment in key areas"&lt;ref&gt;Gershefski, G. (1971) "What's happening in the world of corporate models?", Interfaces, Vol 1, No 4. p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Programming the modelled relationships into the computer is not always necessary: enterprise models, under different names, have existed for centuries and were described, for example, by Adam Smith, Walter Bagehot, and many others.

According to Fox and [[Michael Gruninger|Gruninger]] (1998) from "a design perspective, an enterprise model should provide the language used to explicitly define an enterprise... From an operations perspective, the enterprise model must be able to represent what is planned, what might happen, and what has happened. It must supply the information and knowledge necessary to support the operations of the enterprise, whether they be performed by hand or machine."&lt;ref name="FG98"/&gt;

In a two-volume set entitled ''The Managerial Cybernetics of Organization'' Stafford Beer introduced a model of the enterprise, the Viable System Model (VSM). Volume 2, ''The Heart of Enterprise,''&lt;ref name="MCO2"&gt;Beer, Stafford. (1979) ''The Heart of Enterprise,'' Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the VSM as a recursive organization of five systems: System One (S1) through System Five (S5). Beer's model differs from others in that the VSM is recursive, not hierarchical: "In a recursive organizational structure, any viable system contains, and is contained in, a viable system."&lt;ref name="MCO2"/&gt;

=== Function modelling ===
[[Image:IDEF Diagram Example.jpg|thumb|320px|Example of a function model of the process of "Maintain Reparable Spares" in [[IDEF0]] notation.]]
[[Function model]]ling in systems engineering is a structured representation of the [[Function (engineering)|functions]], activities or [[Process modeling|process]]es within the modelled [[system]] or subject area.&lt;ref name= "ITL93"&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/idef02.doc FIPS Publication 183] released of IDEFØ December 1993 by the Computer Systems Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&lt;/ref&gt;

A function model, also called an [[activity diagram|activity model]] or [[process model]], is a graphical representation of an [[Business|enterprise]]'s function within a defined scope. The purpose of the function model are to describe the functions and processes, assist with discovery of information needs, help identify opportunities, and establish a basis for determining product and service costs.&lt;ref name="rmsc-1995"&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/era/pdf/rmsc-19951006-dod-rm-function-and-information-models.pdf Reader's Guide to IDEF0 Function Models]. Accessed 27 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A function model is created with a functional [[Modeling perspectives|modelling perspective]]. A functional perspectives is one or more perspectives possible in process modelling. Other perspectives possible are for example behavioural, organisational or informational.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.jyu.fi/~jpt/ME2000/Me14/sld004.htm Process perspectives]. In: ''Metamodeling and method engineering'', Minna Koskinen, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A functional modelling perspective concentrates on describing the [[dynamic system|dynamic process]]. The main concept in this modelling perspective is the process, this could be a function, transformation, activity, action, task etc. A well-known example of a modelling language employing this perspective is [[data flow diagram]]s. The perspective uses four symbols to describe a process, these being:
*Process: Illustrates transformation from input to output.
*Store:	   Data-collection or some sort of material.
*Flow:	   Movement of data or material in the process.
*External Entity: External to the modelled system, but interacts with it.
Now, with these symbols, a process can be represented as a network of these symbols. This decomposed process is a DFD, data flow diagram. In [[Dynamic Enterprise Modeling]], for example, a division is made in the [[Control model]], Function Model, [[Process model]] and [[Organizational model]].

=== Data modelling ===
[[Image:4-3 Data Modelling Today.svg|240px|thumb|left|The [[data modeling|data modelling]] process.]] 
[[Data modeling|Data modelling]] is the process of creating a [[data model]] by applying formal data model descriptions using data modelling techniques. Data modelling is a technique for defining business [[requirement]]s for a [[database]]. It is sometimes called ''database modelling'' because a [[data model]] is eventually implemented in a database.&lt;ref name= "WBD04"&gt;[[Whitten, Jeffrey L.]]; [[Lonnie D. Bentley]], [[Kevin C. Dittman]]. (2004). ''Systems Analysis and Design Methods''. 6th edition. {{ISBN|0-256-19906-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure illustrates the way data models are developed and used today. A [[conceptual data model]] is developed based on the data requirements for the application that is being developed, perhaps in the context of an [[activity diagram|activity model]]. The data model will normally consist of entity types, attributes, relationships, integrity rules, and the definitions of those objects. This is then used as the start point for interface or database design.&lt;ref name="MW99"&gt;Matthew West and Julian Fowler (1999). [http://www.matthew-west.org.uk/documents/princ03.pdf Developing High Quality Data Models] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221084613/http://www.matthew-west.org.uk/documents/princ03.pdf |date=2008-12-21 }}.

=== Business process modelling ===
[[Image:BPMN-AProcesswithNormalFlow.svg|thumb|320px|Example of [[business process modeling|business process modelling]] with [[Business Process Model and Notation]].]]

[[Business process modeling|Business process modelling]], not to be confused with the wider [[Business process management|Business Process Management]] (BPM) discipline, is the activity of [[process modeling|representing processes]] of an enterprise, so that the current ("as is") process may be analyzed and improved in future ("to be"). Business process modelling is typically performed by business analysts and managers who are seeking to improve process efficiency and quality. The process improvements identified by business process modelling may or may not require [[Information Technology]] involvement, although that is a common driver for the need to model a business process, by creating a process master.

[[Change management]] programs are typically involved to put the improved business processes into practice. With advances in technology from large platform vendors, the vision of business process modelling models becoming fully executable (and capable of simulations and round-trip engineering) is coming closer to reality every day.

=== Systems architecture ===
The [[RM-ODP]] reference model identifies enterprise modelling as providing one of the five viewpoints of an open distributed system. Note that such a system need not be a modern-day IT system: a banking clearing house in the 19th century may be used as an example (&lt;ref&gt;Haim Kilov. ''Business models - A Guide for Business and IT.'' Prentice-Hall, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Enterprise modelling techniques ==
There are several techniques for modelling the enterprise such as 
* Active Knowledge Modeling,&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lillehagen, [[John Krogstie]] (2008). ''Active Knowledge Modeling of Enterprises''. Springer, 2008. {{ISBN|3-540-79415-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Design &amp; Engineering Methodology for Organizations]] (DEMO)
* [[Dynamic Enterprise Modeling]]
* [[Enterprise Modelling Methodology/Open Distributed Processing]] (EMM/ODP)
* [[Extended Enterprise Modeling Language]]
* Multi-Perspective Enterprise Modelling (MEMO),&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulrich Frank]] (2002).

In: ''Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS-35). Los Alamitos, CA.'' Ralph H. Sprague, Jr. (eds.). IEEE Computer Society Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Process modelling such as [[Business Process Model and Notation|BPMN]], [[CIMOSA]], [[DYA framework|DYA]], [[IDEF3]], LOVEM, [[Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture|PERA]], etc.
* [[Integrated Enterprise Modeling]] (IEM), and
* Modelling the enterprise with [[multi-agent systems]].

More enterprise modelling techniques are developed into [[Enterprise Architecture framework]] such as:
* [[Architecture of Integrated Information Systems|ARIS]] - ARchitecture of Integrated Information Systems
* [[DoDAF]] - the US Department of Defense Architecture Framework
* [[RM-ODP]] - Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing
* [[TOGAF]] - The [[Open Group]] Architecture Framework
* [[Zachman Framework]] - an architecture framework, based on the work of [[John Zachman]] at IBM in the 1980s
* [[service-oriented modeling#Service-oriented modeling framework|Service-oriented modeling framework (SOMF)]], based on the work of [[Michael B.T. Bell|Michael Bell]]
And metamodelling frameworks such as:
* [[Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology]]

== Enterprise engineering ==
[[Enterprise engineering]] is the discipline concerning the design and the engineering of [[Business|enterprises]], regarding both their [[business process|business]] and [[organization]].&lt;ref name="Die06"&gt;[[Jan Dietz]] (2006). ''Enterprise Ontology - Theory and Methodology''. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory and practice two types of enterprise engineering has emerged. A more general connected to engineering and the management of enterprises, and a more specific related to software engineering, enterprise modelling and enterprise architecture.

In the field of [[engineering]] a more general enterprise engineering emerged, defined&lt;ref name="Pil08"&gt;[http://personal.rhul.ac.uk/uhtm/001/homepage.html Enterprise Engineering Research at Royal Holloway] led by Dr [[Alan Pilkington]], Ver 9.08. Accessed 4 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; as the application of [[engineering]] principals to the [[management]] of [[Company|enterprises]]. It encompasses the application of  knowledge, principles, and disciplines related to the analysis, design, implementation and operation of all elements associated with an enterprise. In essence this is an [[interdisciplinary field]] which combines [[systems engineering]] and [[strategic management]] as it seeks to engineer the entire enterprise in terms of the [[Product (business)|product]]s, [[Process modeling|process]]es and [[business operations]]. The view is one of continuous improvement and continued adaptation as firms, processes and markets develop along their [[Enterprise Life Cycle|life cycle]]s. This total systems approach encompasses the traditional areas of research and development, product design, operations and manufacturing as well as information systems and strategic management.&lt;ref name="Pil08"/&gt; This fields is related to [[engineering management]], [[operations management]], [[service management]] and systems engineering.

In the context of [[software development]] a specific field of enterprise engineering has emerged, which deals with the modelling and integration of various organizational and technical parts of [[business process]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[[François Vernadat|Vernadat, F.B]]. (1996) ''Enterprise Modeling and Integration: Principles and Applications''. Chapman &amp; Hall, London, {{ISBN|0-412-60550-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of information systems development it has been the area of activity in the organization of the [[systems analysis]], and an extension of the scope of [[Information Modelling]].&lt;ref&gt;J A Bubenko (1993). "Extending the Scope of Information Modelling". In: ''Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on the Deductive Approach to Information Systems and Databases, Costa Brava, Catalonia''. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be viewed as the extension and generalization of the [[systems analysis]] and [[systems design]] phases of the [[software development process]].&lt;ref name="GG03"&gt;Gustas, R and Gustiene, P (2003) "Towards the Enterprise engineering approach for Information system modelling across organisational and technical boundaries", in: ''Proceedings of the fifth International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems'', vol. 3, Angers, France, 2003, pp. 77-88.&lt;/ref&gt; Here Enterprise modelling can be part of the early, middle and late [[Systems Development Life Cycle|information system development life cycle]]. Explicit representation of the organizational and technical system infrastructure is being created in order to understand the orderly transformations of existing work practices.&lt;ref name="GG03"/&gt; This field is also called [[Enterprise architecture]], or defined with [[Enterprise Ontology]] as being two major parts of Enterprise architecture.&lt;ref name="Die06"/&gt;

=== Business reference modelling ===
[[Image:Government Business Reference Model.svg|thumb|320px|Example of the US [[Federal Enterprise Architecture|FEA]] Business Reference Model.&lt;ref&gt;FEA (2005) [https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/pdf/rm-profile.pdf FEA Records Management Profile, Version 1.0]. December 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Business reference model]]ling is the development of [[reference model]]s concentrating on the functional and organizational aspects of the [[core business]] of an [[Business|enterprise]], [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service organization]] or [[government agency]]. In enterprise engineering a business reference model is part of an [[enterprise architecture framework]]. This framework defines in a series of reference models, how to organize the structure and [[view model|views]] associated with an [[Enterprise Architecture]].

A [[reference model]] in general is a model of something that embodies the basic goal or idea of something and can then be looked at as a reference for various purposes. A business reference model is a means to describe the [[business operations]] of an organization, independent of the [[organizational structure]] that perform them. Other types of business reference model can also depict the relationship between the [[business process]]es, business functions, and the [[business area]]’s business reference model. These reference model can be constructed in layers, and offer a foundation for the analysis of service components, technology, data, and performance.

=== Economic modelling ===
[[Image:Islm.svg|thumb|left|A diagram of the [[IS/LM model]]]]
[[Economic model]]ling is the theoretical representation of economic processes by a set of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] and a set of [[logic]]al and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic model is a simplified framework designed to illustrate complex processes, often but not always using [[Mathematical model|mathematical techniques]]. Frequently, economic models use structural parameters. Structural parameters are underlying [[Parameter#Statistics and econometrics|parameters]] in a model or class of models.&lt;ref&gt;Moffatt, Mike. (2008) [[About.com]] ''[http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/structuralp.htm Structural Parameters]'' Economics Glossary; Terms Beginning with S. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A model may have various parameters and those parameters may change to create various properties.&lt;ref name="structure"&gt;Moffatt, Mike. (2008) [[About.com]] ''[http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/structure.htm Structure]'' Economics Glossary; Terms Beginning with S. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general terms, economic models have two functions: first as a simplification of and abstraction from observed data, and second as a means of selection of data based on a [[paradigm]] of [[econometric]] study. The simplification is particularly important for economics given the enormous [[complexity]] of economic processes.  This complexity can be attributed to the diversity of factors that determine economic activity; these factors include: individual  and [[co-operation|cooperative]] decision processes, [[Natural resource|resource]] limitations, [[natural environment|environment]]al and [[geography|geographical]] constraints, institutional and [[law|legal]] requirements and purely random fluctuations.  Economists therefore must make a reasoned choice of which variables and which relationships between these variables are relevant and which ways of analyzing and presenting this information are useful.

=== Ontology engineering ===
[[Ontology engineering]] or ''ontology building'' is a subfield of [[knowledge engineering]] that studies the methods and methodologies for building ontologies. In the domain of enterprise architecture, an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] is an outline or a schema used to structure objects, their attributes and relationships in a consistent manner.&lt;ref name="Ostie96"/&gt; As in enterprise modelling, an ontology can be composed of other ontologies. The purpose of ontologies in enterprise modelling is to formalize and establish the sharability, re-usability, assimilation and dissemination of information across all organizations and departments within an enterprise. Thus, an ontology enables integration of the various functions and processes which take place in an enterprise.&lt;ref name="FFG94"&gt;G. Fadel, M. Fox, [[M. Gruninger]] (1994). "A Generic Enterprise Resource Ontology". In: ''Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises''. p. 117-128&lt;/ref&gt;

One common language with well articulated structure and vocabulary would enable the company to be more efficient in its operations. A common ontology will allow for effective communication, understanding and thus coordination among the various divisions of an enterprise. There are various kinds of ontologies used in numerous environments. While the language example given earlier dealt with the area of information systems and design, other ontologies may be defined for processes, methods, activities, etc., within an enterprise.&lt;ref name="Ostie96"/&gt;

Using ontologies in enterprise modelling offers several advantages. Ontologies ensure clarity, consistency, and structure to a model. They promote efficient model definition and analysis. Generic [[enterprise ontologies]] allow for reusability of and automation of components. Because ontologies are schemata or outlines, the use of ontologies does not ensure proper enterprise model definition, analysis, or clarity. Ontologies are limited by how they are defined and implemented. An ontology may or may not include the potential or capability to capture all of the aspects of what is being modelled.&lt;ref name="Ostie96"/&gt;

=== Systems thinking ===
{{main|Systems thinking}}
The modelling of the enterprise and its environment could facilitate the creation of enhanced understanding of the business domain and processes of the extended enterprise, and especially of the relations—both those that "hold the enterprise together" and those that extend across the boundaries of the enterprise. Since enterprise is a system, concepts used in system thinking&lt;ref&gt;(see, for example, (Weinberg, 1982), or, more generally, works by Bunge, for example, (Bunge, 2003) and by Hayek, for example, (Hayek, 1967))&lt;/ref&gt; can be successfully reused in modelling enterprises.

This way a fast understanding can be achieved throughout the enterprise about how business functions are working and how they depend upon other functions in the organization.

{{SikhBeliefs}}
In [[Sikhism]], the '''Five Virtues''' are fundamental qualities which one should develop in order to reach [[Moksha|Mukti]], or to reunite or merge with God. The [[Sikh Gurus]] taught that these positive human qualities were [[Sat (Sikhism)|Sat]] (truth), [[Daya (Sikhism)|Daya]] (compassion), [[Santokh]] (contentment), [[Nimrata]] (humility), and [[Pyaar]] (love).

==Sat==
[[Sat (Sikhism)|Sat]] is the virtue of truthful living, which means practising "righteousness, honesty, justice, impartiality and fair play."&lt;ref name="Mansukhani"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mansukhani |first=Gobind Singh |title=Introduction to Sikhism |url=http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/mansukh/047.htm |accessdate=2007-02-10 |year=1977 |publisher=Hemkunt Press |location=[[New Delhi]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The Lord's humble servants are True — they practice Truth, and reflect upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad. The True Lord God unites them with Himself, and they keep the True Lord enshrined in their hearts. O Nanak, through the Name, I have obtained salvation and understanding; this alone is my wealth.|[[Guru Granth Sahib]], page 600}}

==Santokh==
[[Santokh]], or contentment, is freedom "from ambition, envy, greed and jealousy. Without contentment, it is impossible to acquire peace of mind."&lt;ref name="Mansukhani" /&gt;

{{Quotation|Practice truth, contentment and kindness; this is the most excellent way of life. One who is so blessed by the Formless Lord God renounces selfishness, and becomes the dust of all.|Guru Granth Sahib, ang 51}}

==Daya==

The exercise of [[Daya (Sikhism)|Daya]], or compassion, involves "considering another's difficulty or sorrow as one's own and helping to relieve it as far as possible. Compassion also includes the overlooking of imperfections and mistakes of others, for to err is human."&lt;ref name="Mansukhani" /&gt;

{{Quotation|Be kind to all beings-this is more meritorious than bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage and the giving of charity.|Guru Granth Sahib, ang 136}}

==Nimrata==
[[Nimrata]], translated as "humility", "benevolence" or "humbleness", is the fourth virtue.

{{Quotation|The God-conscious being is steeped in humility.|Guru Granth Sahib, page 273}}

==[[Pyaar]]==

[[Pyaar]] requires Sikhs to be filled with the love of God.

{{Quotation|Let the Fear of God be your feet, and let His Love be your hands; let His Understanding be your eyes.|Guru Granth Sahib,ang  139}}

'''Foot binding''' was the custom of applying tight binding to the feet of young girls to modify the shape and size of their feet. It was practised in China from the [[Song dynasty]] until the early 20th century, and bound feet were considered a status symbol as well as a mark of beauty. Foot binding limited the mobility of women, and resulted in lifelong disabilities for most of its subjects, although some women with bound feet working outdoors have also been reported. Feet altered by binding were called '''lotus feet'''.

The practice possibly originated among upper class court dancers during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] in 10th century China, then became popular among the elite during the [[Song dynasty]], eventually spreading to all social classes by the [[Qing dynasty]]. Foot binding was practiced in different forms, and the more severe form of binding may have been developed in the 16th century. It has been estimated that by the 19th century, 40–50% of all Chinese women may have had bound feet, and up to almost 100% among upper class Chinese women.&lt;ref name="lim" &gt;{{cite web |last=Lim |first=Louisa |title=Painful Memories for China's Footbinding Survivors |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=8966942 |work=Morning Edition |publisher=National Public Radio |date=19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence and practice of foot binding however varied in different parts of the country.

There had been attempts to end the practice during the Qing dynasty; Manchu [[Kangxi Emperor]] tried to ban foot binding in 1664 but failed.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In the later part of the 19th century, Chinese reformers challenged the practice but it was not until the early 20th century that foot binding began to die out as a result of anti-foot-binding campaigns.  Only a few elderly Chinese women still survive today with bound feet.&lt;ref name="lim"/&gt;

== History ==

=== Origin ===
[[File:Yaoniang binding feet.jpg|thumb|200px|18th-century illustration showing Yao Niang binding her own feet]]

There are a number of stories about the origin of foot binding before its establishment during the Song dynasty. One of these involves the story of a favorite consort of the [[Southern Qi]] emperor [[Xiao Baojuan]], [[Pan Yunu]] (died 501 AD), who had delicate feet and danced barefoot on a floor decorated with golden lotus flower design. The emperor expressed admiration and said that "lotus springs from her every step!" (步步生蓮), a reference to the Buddhist legend of Padmavati under whose feet lotus springs forth.

The general view is that the practice is likely to have originated from the time of the 10th-century [[Li Yu (Southern Tang)|Emperor Li Yu]] of the [[Southern Tang]], just before the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/ptop/alabaster/A1155872 |title=Chinese Foot Binding |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Li Yu created a six-foot tall golden lotus decorated with precious stones and pearls, and asked his concubine {{Interlanguage link multi|Yao Niang|zh|3=窅娘}} to bind her feet in white silk into the shape of the crescent moon, and perform a ballet-like dance on the points of her feet on the lotus.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Yao Niang's dance was said to be so graceful that others sought to imitate her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=qpNQ91M3BswC&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author=Dorothy Ko |pages=42 |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0-520-23284-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The binding of feet was then replicated by other upper-class women and the practice spread.&lt;ref name="pitts-taylor"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=66u24WAyO_YC&amp;pg=PA203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Body |page=203 |editor=Victoria Pitts-Taylor |publisher=Greenwood |date= 2008 |isbn=978-0-313-34145-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest possible references to foot binding appear around 1100, when a couple of poems seemed to allude to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/index.php/component/k2/item/10758-han-chinese-footbinding |title=Han Chinese Footbinding |work=Textile Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xu Ji 徐積 《詠蔡家婦》： 「但知勒四支，不知裹两足。」(translation: "knowing about arranging the four limbs, but not about binding her two feet); [[Su Shi]] 蘇軾 《菩薩蠻》：「塗香莫惜蓮承步，長愁羅襪凌波去；只見舞回風，都無行處踪。偷穿宮樣穩，並立雙趺困，纖妙說應難，須從掌上看。」&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ebrey 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xjoLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38 |title=The Inner Quarters: Marriage and the Lives of Chinese Women in the Sung Period|author= Patricia Buckley  Ebrey|pages=37–39 |isbn= 9780520913486 |publisher=University of California Press |date=1 December 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; Soon after 1148,&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; in the earliest extant discourse on the practice of foot binding, scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Zhang Bangji|zh|3=張邦基}} wrote that a bound foot should be arch-shape and small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |pages=111–115 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wenxian.fanren8.com/08/05/5/8.htm |title=墨庄漫录-宋-张邦基  8-卷八 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that "women's footbinding began in recent times; it was not mentioned in any books from previous eras."&lt;ref name="Morris2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Morris (historian)|title=Why the West Rules - For Now: The Patterns of History, and What They Reveal About the Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qNVrfoSubmIC&amp;pg=PA424 |date=2011|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|isbn=978-1-55199-581-6|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Che Ruoshui|zh|3=车若水}} wrote the first known criticism of the practice: "Little girls not yet four or five years old, who have done nothing wrong, nevertheless are made to suffer unlimited pain to bind [their feet] small.

The earliest archaeological evidence for foot binding dates to the tombs of Huang Sheng, who died in 1243 at the age of 17, and Madame Zhou, who died in 1274. Each had her feet bound with 6-foot-long gauze strips. Zhou's skeleton was well preserved and showed that her feet fit the narrow, pointed slippers that were buried with her.&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; The style of bound feet found in Song dynasty tombs, where the big toe was bent upwards, appears to be different from the norm of later eras, and the excessive smallness of the feet, the "three-inch golden lotus", may be a later development in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |pages=187–191 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJHUFRTYpA4C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |pages=21–24 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the Song dynasty, men would drink from a special shoe whose heel contained a small cup. During the [[Yuan dynasty]], some would also drink directly from the shoe itself. This practice was called "toast to the golden lotus" and lasted until the late [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref name="shoe"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=2Ifj9h4Z4YQC&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Art of the Shoe |author= Marie-Josèphe Bossan |page=164 |publisher=Parkstone Press Ltd |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-85995-803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European to mention footbinding was the Italian missionary [[Odoric of Pordenone]] in the fourteenth century during the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iL2AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History |first=Patricia|last= Ebrey |page=196|publisher=Routledge |isbn= 9781134442935 |date=2003-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no other foreign visitors to [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] China mentioned the practice, including [[Ibn Battuta]] and [[Marco Polo]] (who nevertheless noted the dainty walk of Chinese women who took very small steps), perhaps an indication that it was not a widespread or extreme practice at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSfvfr8VQSEC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Marco Polo's China: A Venetian in the Realm of Khubilai Khan |first= Stephen G. |last=Haw |pages=55–56 |publisher=Routledge| isbn=9781134275427|date=2006-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice however was encouraged by the Mongol rulers on their Chinese subjects.&lt;ref name="pitts-taylor"/&gt; The practice became increasingly common among the gentry families, later spreading to the general population, as commoners and theatre actors alike adopted footbinding.

[[File:Chaussure chinoise Saverne 02 05 2012 1.jpg|thumb|230px|A lotus shoe for bound feet. The ideal length for a bound foot was 3 Chinese inches (寸), which is around {{convert|4|in|cm|0}} in western measurement.]]

The Manchus issued a number of edicts to ban the practice, first in 1636 when the Manchu leader [[Hong Taiji]] declared the founding of the new Qing dynasty, then in 1638, and another in 1664 by the [[Kangxi Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYgQWAfHjmsC&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation|author= Li-Hsiang, Lisa Rosenlee |page=144 |publisher= State University of New York Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0-7914-6750-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, few Han Chinese complied with the edicts and Kangxi eventually abandoned the effort in 1668. 
By the 19th century, it was estimated that 40-50% of Chinese women had bound feet, and among upper class Han Chinese women, the figure was almost 100%.&lt;ref name="lim" /&gt; Bound feet became a mark of beauty and was also a prerequisite for finding a husband. It also became an avenue for poorer women to [[Hypergamy|marry into money]] in some areas; for example, in late 19th century Guangdong, it was customary to bind the feet of the eldest daughter of a lower-class family who was intended to be brought up as a lady. Her younger sisters would grow up to be bond-servants or domestic slaves and be able to work in the fields, but the eldest daughter would assume to never have the need to work. Women, their families, and their husbands took great pride in tiny feet, with the ideal length, called the "Golden Lotus", being about three [[Cun (unit)|Chinese inches]] long (around {{convert|4|in|cm|0}} in Western measurement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=8 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manning|first=Mary Ellen|title=China's "Golden Lotus Feet" - Foot-binding Practice|url=http://travel.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474976997081|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=10 May 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928031927/http://travel.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474976997081|archivedate=28 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pride was reflected in the elegantly embroidered silk slippers and wrappings girls and women wore to cover their feet. Walking on bound feet necessitated bending the knees slightly and swaying to maintain proper movement and balance, a dainty walk that was also considered erotic to some men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity |author= Janell L.

Some women with bound feet may not walk without the support of their shoes and were severely limited in their mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NieEnuWegkoC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;lpg=PA302#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Film Review - Footbinding: Search for the Three Inch Golden Lotus |journal=Anthropologica |date=2004 |volume=48|issue=2|first=Laurel |last=Bossen |pages=301–303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many women with bound feet were still able to walk and work in the fields, albeit with greater limitation than their non-bound counterparts.  In the 19th and early 20th century, dancers with bound feet were popular, as were circus performers who stood on prancing or running horses. Women with bound feet in one village in [[Yunnan]] Province even formed a regional dance troupe to perform for tourists in the late 20th century, though age has since forced the group to retire.&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt; In other areas, women in their 70s and 80s could be found providing limited assistance to the workers in the rice fields well into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="lim" /&gt;

=== Demise ===
Opposition to foot binding had been raised by some Chinese writers in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century, many of the rebel leaders of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] were of Hakka background whose womenfolk did not bind their feet, and foot binding was outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYjGN4UM1mMC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=27–29 |title=The Taiping Ideology: Its Sources, Interpretations, and Influences|author1=Vincent Yu-Chung Shih |author2=Yu-chung Shi |publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1968 |isbn=978-0-295-73957-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UBqr_MEn4m4C&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=For Our Daughters: How Outstanding Women Worldwide Have Balanced Home and Career|author= Olivia Cox-Fill|page=57|publisher=Praeger Publishers |year= 1996|isbn= 978-0-275-95199-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion however failed, and Christian missionaries, who had provided education for girls and actively discouraged what they considered a barbaric practice, then played a part in changing elite opinion on footbinding through education, [[pamphleteering]], and lobbying of the Qing court.&lt;ref name="blake 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cross-cultural Study of Women: A Comprehensive Guide|author= Mary I.

"  Besides improvements in civil engineering, progress was made in social areas as well. The traditional Chinese practice of foot binding was widespread in Taiwan's early years. Traditional Chinese society perceived women with smaller feet as being more beautiful. Women would bind their feet with long bandages to stunt growth.
Even housemaids were divided into those with bound feet and those without. The former served the daughters of the house, while the latter were assigned heavier work. This practice was later regarded as barbaric. In the early years of the Japanese colonial period, the Foot-binding Liberation Society was established to promote the idea of natural feet, but its influence was limited.
The fact that women suffered higher casualties in the 1906 Meishan quake with 551 men and 700 women dead, and 1,099 men and 1,334 women injured--very different from the situation in Japan--raised public concern. Foot binding was blamed and this gave impetus to the drive to stamp out the practice."&lt;/ref&gt; The practice however lingered on in some regions in China; in 1928, a census in rural [[Shanxi]] found that 18% of women had bound feet,&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125800116737444883  |title=Bound by History: The Last of China's 'Lotus-Feet' Ladies |author= Simon Montlake |date = November 13, 2009 |work=Wall Street Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in some remote rural areas such as [[Yunnan Province]] it continued to be practiced until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Favazza, Armando R.

Foot binding was practiced in various forms and its prevalence varied in different regions. A less severe form in Sichuan, called "cucumber foot" (''huanggua jiao'') due to its slender shape, folded the four toes under but did not distort the heel and taper the ankle.&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=7 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some working women in [[Jiangsu]] made a pretense of binding while keeping their feet natural.&lt;ref name="blake 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA327#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History |author=C Fred Blake|pages=327–329|editor= Bonnie G.

[[Manchu people|Manchu]] women, as well as Mongol and Chinese women in the [[Eight Banners]], did not bind their feet, and the most a Manchu woman might do was to wrap the feet tightly to give them a slender appearance.&lt;ref name="manchu"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last=Elliott|first=Mark C.|title=The Manchu Way: the Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0-8047-3606-0|pages=246–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Manchus, wanting to emulate the particular gait that bound feet necessitated, adapted their own form of platform shoes to cause them to walk in a similar swaying manner. These "flower bowl" (花盆鞋) or "horse-hoof" shoes (馬蹄鞋) have a platform generally made of wood two to six inches in height and fitted to the middle of the sole, or they have a small central tapered pedestal. Many Han Chinese in the Inner City of Beijing also did not bind their feet, and it was reported in the mid-1800s that around 50-60% of non-banner women had unbound feet. Bound feet nevertheless became a significant differentiating marker between Han women and Manchu or other banner women.&lt;ref name="manchu" /&gt;

}}

The process was started before the arch of the foot had a chance to develop fully, usually between the ages of 4 and 9. Binding usually started during the winter months since the feet were more likely to be numb, and therefore the pain would not be as extreme.&lt;ref name="slippers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Beverley|title=Splendid Slippers: A Thousand Years of an Erotic Tradition |publisher=Ten Speed Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-89815-957-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, each foot would be soaked in a warm mixture of herbs and animal blood; this was intended to soften the foot and aid the binding. Then, the toenails were cut back as far as possible to prevent in-growth and subsequent infections, since the toes were to be pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. Cotton bandages, 3&amp;nbsp;m long and 5&amp;nbsp;cm wide (10&amp;nbsp;ft by 2 in), were prepared by soaking them in the blood and herb mixture. To enable the size of the feet to be reduced, the toes on each foot were curled under, then pressed with great force downwards and squeezed into the sole of the foot until the toes broke.

The broken toes were held tightly against the sole of the foot while the foot was then drawn down straight with the leg and the arch of the foot was forcibly broken. The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of the foot at the instep, then carried over the toes, under the foot, and around the heel, the freshly broken toes being pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. At each pass around the foot, the binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of the foot and the heel together, causing the broken foot to fold at the arch, and pressing the toes underneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the girl could not move her toes at all and the ends of the binding cloth were then sewn so that the girl could not loosen it.
[[File:Bound feet (X-ray).jpg|thumb|An X-ray of two bound feet]]
[[File:FootBindingRxSchema2.gif|thumb|Schema of an x-ray comparison between an unbound and bound foot]]

The girl's broken feet required a great deal of care and attention, and they would be unbound regularly. Each time the feet were unbound, they were washed, the toes carefully checked for injury, and the nails carefully and meticulously trimmed. When unbound, the broken feet were also kneaded to soften them and the soles of the girl's feet were often beaten to make the joints and broken bones more flexible. The feet were also soaked in a concoction that caused any necrotic flesh to fall off.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;

Immediately after this procedure, the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The bindings were pulled even tighter each time the girl's feet were rebound. This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated as often as possible (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants two or three times a week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight.&lt;ref name=slippers /&gt;

For most the bound feet eventually became numb.  However, once a foot had been crushed and bound, attempting to reverse the process by unbinding was painful,&lt;ref name=body&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0122BsqrZwC&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Encyclopedia of Body Adornment|author= Margo DeMello |pages=116–117 |publisher=Greenwood Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0-313-33695-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the shape could not be reversed without a woman undergoing the same pain all over again.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;

=== Health issues ===
The most common problem with bound feet was infection. Despite the amount of care taken in regularly trimming the toenails, they would often in-grow, becoming infected and causing injuries to the toes. Sometimes, for this reason, the girl's toenails would be peeled back and removed altogether. The tightness of the binding meant that the circulation in the feet was faulty, and the circulation to the toes was almost cut off, so any injuries to the toes were unlikely to heal and were likely to gradually worsen and lead to infected toes and rotting flesh. The necrosis of the flesh would also initially give off a foul odor, and later the smell may come from various microorganisms that colonized the folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/21/china.gender |title= The ties that bind |first=Fraser|last= Newham|date= 21 March 2005 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the infection in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; however, this was seen as a benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ac2UAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA423#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=

At the beginning of the binding, many of the foot bones would remain broken, often for years. However, as the girl grew older, the bones would begin to heal. Even after the foot bones had healed, they were prone to re-breaking repeatedly, especially when the girl was in her teenage years and her feet were still soft. Bones in the girls' feet would often be deliberately broken again in order to further change the size or shape of the feet. This was especially the case with the toes, as small toes were especially desirable.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Older women were more likely to break hips and other bones in falls, since they could not balance securely on their feet, and were less able to rise to their feet from a sitting position.&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, S. &amp; Stone, K.

== Views and interpretations ==

===Beauty and erotic appeal===
[[File:Woman with bound feet reclining on chaise lounge, China LCCN2001705601.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Bound feet were considered by some to be highly appealing]]
Before footbinding was practiced in China, admiration for small feet already existed as demonstrated by the [[Tang dynasty]] tale of [[Ye Xian]] written around 850 by [[Duan Chengshi]]. This tale of a girl who lost her shoe and then married a king who sought the owner of the shoe as only her foot was small enough to fit the shoe contains elements of the European story of [[Cinderella]], and is thought to be one of its antecedents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jruLAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding: A Jungian Engagement with Chinese Culture and Psychology |author= Shirley See Yan Ma |pages=75&amp;ndash;78 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd |date=4 December 2009 |isbn=9781135190071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/25ii/10_25.2.pdf |title=Asian Origins of Cinderella: The Zhuang Storyteller of Guangxi |journal=Oral Tradition|volume=25|number=2 |first=Fay |last=Beauchamp |pages=447–496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many, the bound feet were an enhancement to a woman's beauty and made her movement more dainty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia Buckley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vr81YoYK0c4C&amp;pg=PA160 |title='Cambridge Illustrated History of China|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|pages=160–161|edition=2nd|isbn=9780521124331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a woman with perfect lotus feet was likely to make a more prestigious marriage. The desirability varies with the size of the feet &amp;ndash; the perfect bound feet and the most desirable (called "golden lotuses") would be around 3 Chinese inches (around 4 inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm) in Western measurement) or smaller, while those larger may be called "silver lotuses" (4 Chinese inches) or "iron lotuses" (5 Chinese inches or larger and the least desirable for marriage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbJ3DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59 |title=The Aesthetics of Dress |first= Ian |last=King |page=59 |isbn=9783319543222 |publisher=Springer|date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that footbinding made women more desirable to men is widely used as an explanation for the spread and persistence of footbinding.&lt;ref name="hill 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |page=56 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some also considered bound feet to be intensely erotic, and Qing Dynasty sex manuals listed 48 different ways of playing with women's bound feet. Some men preferred never to see a woman's bound feet, so they were always concealed within tiny "lotus shoes" and wrappings.  According to [[Robert van Gulik]], the bound feet were also considered the most intimate part of a woman's body; in erotic art of the Qing to Song periods where the genitalia may be shown, the bound feet were never depicted uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=85M3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Sexual life in ancient China:A Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from Ca. 1500 B.C.

An erotic effect of the bound feet was the lotus gait, the tiny steps and swaying walk of a woman whose feet had been bound. Women with such deformed feet avoided placing weight on the front of the foot and tended to walk predominantly on their heels. As a result, women who had undergone foot-binding would walk in a cautious and unsteady manner.&lt;ref name=slippers /&gt;  Some men found the smell of the bound feet attractive, and some also apparently believed that bound feet would cause layers of folds to develop in the vagina, and that the thighs would become sensuously heavier and the vagina tighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xmdKklZM9-kC&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Bodies under Siege: Self-mutilation, Nonsuicidal Self-injury, and Body Modification in Culture and Psychiatry|author= Armando R.

===Role of Confucianism===
[[File:A HIGH CASTE LADYS DAINTY LILY FEET.jpg|thumb|220px|A woman with her feet unwrapped]]

A common argument is that the revival of [[Confucianism]] as [[Neo-Confucianism]] during the Song dynasty resulted in the decline of the status of women, and that in addition to promoting the seclusion of women and the [[cult of widow chastity]], it also contributed to the development of footbinding.&lt;ref name="ebrey 2"/&gt; According to [[Robert van Gulik]], the prominent Song Confucian scholar [[Zhu Xi]] stressed the inferiority of women as well as the need to keep men and women strictly separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Chinese Outcasts: Discrimination and Emancipation in Late Imperial China|author= Anders Hansson|page=46 |publisher=Brill |year= 1996 |isbn= 978-9004105966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed by [[Lin Yutang]] among others, probably based on an oral tradition, that [[Zhu Xi]] also promoted footbinding in [[Fujian]] as a way of encouraging chastity among women, that by restricting their movement it would help keep men and women separate.&lt;ref name="ebrey 2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDPskRXfl5cC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History|author= Patricia Buckley Ebrey |pages=10&amp;ndash;12|publisher=Routledge |date=19 September 2002 |isbn= 978-0415288224}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian [[Patricia Buckley Ebrey|Patricia Ebrey]] suggests that this story might be fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA139|title= Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation |author= Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |date= April 2006|isbn= 978-0-7914-6749-7 |page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Confucian moralists in fact disapproved of the erotic associations of footbinding, and unbound women were also praised.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bonnie G.

It is however argued that such injunction applies less to women, rather it is meant to emphasize the sacred link between sons and their parents. Furthermore, it is argued that Confucianism institutionalized the family system in which women are called upon to sacrifice themselves for the good of the family, a system that fostered such practice.&lt;ref name="blake"/&gt; Confucian instructions on the moral behaviour of women would include examples of women who were prepared to die or suffer mutilation to show their commitment to the Confucian ethos.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;

Historian [[Dorothy Y. Ko|Dorothy Ko]] proposed that footbinding may be an expression of the Confucian ideals of civility and culture in the form of correct attire or bodily adornment, and that footbinding was seen as a necessary part of being feminine as well as being civilized.  Footbinding was often classified in Chinese encyclopedia as clothing or a form of bodily embellishment rather than mutilation; one from 1591 for example placed footbinding in a section on "Female Adornments" that included hairdos, powders, and ear-piercings.  According to Ko, the perception of footbinding as a civilised practice may be evinced from a [[Ming dynasty]] account that mentioned a proposal to "entice [the barbarians] to civilize their customs" by encouraging footbinding among their womenfolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://womenshistory.osu.edu/sites/womenshistory.osu.edu/files/The%20Body%20as%20Attire.pdf |title=The Body as Attire: The Shifting Meanings of Footbinding in Seventeenth-Century China |journal=Journal of Women's History|volume =8|number= 4 |date= 1997 |pages= 8–27 |doi= 10.1353/jowh.2010.0171 |first=Dorothy|last= Ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was also carried out only by women on girls, and it served to emphasize the distinction between male and female, an emphasis that began from an early age.&lt;ref name="steele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ko1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorothy Ko|title=Teachers of the Inner Chambers: Women and Culture in Seventeenth-century China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nNcRiE-TKsC&amp;pg=PA149|year=1994|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2359-6|pages=149–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Fred Blake argued that the practice of footbinding was a form of discipline undertaken by women themselves, and perpetuated by women on their daughters, so as to inform their daughters of their role and position in society, and to support and participate in the neo-Confucian way of being civilized.&lt;ref name="blake"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://anthropology.hawaii.edu/People/Faculty/Blake/pdfs/1994%20%20Foot-binding%20in%20Neo-Confucian%20China.pdf|title=Foot-Binding in Neo-Confucian China and the Appropriation of Female Labor | author=C.

===Feminist perspective===
{{Violence against women|sp=uk}}
Foot binding is often seen by feminists as an oppressive practice against women who were victims of a sexist culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation |authors=Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |page=139 | isbn=9780791481790|publisher= SUNY Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rophdLUYIjcC&amp;pg=PT246#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding, Feminism and Freedom: The Liberation of Women's Bodies in Modern China|author= Fan Hong|isbn=9781136303142 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also widely seen as a form of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ac2UAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA423 |title=Ordinary Violence: Everyday Assaults against Women Worldwide|edition= 2nd|author= Mary White Stewart |pages=423–437 |publisher=Praeger|date=27 January 2014|isbn= 9781440829383}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOKAMXEA_jQC&amp;pg=PA310 |title=Encyclopedia of Interpersonal Violence, Volume 1 |editors= Claire M.

She argued that women, by retaining their small bound feet, made themselves subservient as it would mean women imprisoning themselves indoors. She believed that women should emancipate themselves from oppression, that girls can ensure their independence through education, and that they should develop new mental and physical qualities fitting for the new era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cLd_h5Hh00C&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding, Feminism, and Freedom: The Liberation of Women's Bodies in Modern China|author= Hong Fan |publisher= Routledge |pages= 90–96|date=1 June 1997|isbn= 978-0714646336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qiu jin"/&gt; The ending of the practice is seen as a significant event in the process of female emancipation in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cLd_h5Hh00C&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding, Feminism, and Freedom: The Liberation of Women's Bodies in Modern China|author= Hong Fan |publisher= Routledge |date=1 June 1997|isbn= 978-0714646336 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other interpretations===

Some scholars such as Laurel Bossen and Hill Gates reject the theories that bound feet in China were considered more beautiful, or that it was a means of male control over women, a sign of class status, or a chance for women to marry well. They argued that foot binding was important in work, and can be seen as a way by mothers to tie their daughters down, train them in handwork and keep them close at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/12/unraveling-a-brutal-custom/ |title=Unraveling a brutal custom |author=Colleen Walsh |work=Harvard Gazette |date=December 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that while the practice started out as a fashion, it persisted because it became an expression of Han identity after the Mongols invaded China in 1279, and later the Manchus' conquest in 1644, as it was then practiced only by Han women.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;&lt;ref name="steele"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw1_yKwk_XkC&amp;pg=PA40 |pages=40–41 |title=China Chic: East Meets West|author1=Valerie Steele |author2=John S. Major |publisher=Yale University Press |year= 2000 |isbn=978-0-300-07931-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Qing Dynasty, attempts were made by the Manchus to ban the practice but failed, and it has been argued the attempts at banning may have in fact led to a spread of the practice among Han Chinese in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA266#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |page=266 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature, film and television ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
&lt;!-- This is not a place to list every novel that mentions footbinding, or a film or TV shows that happens to have a character with bound feet. --&gt;

The bound foot has played a prominent part in many media works, both Chinese and non-Chinese, modern and traditional. These depictions are sometimes based on observation or research and sometimes on rumors or supposition. Sometimes, as in the case of [[Pearl Buck]]'s ''[[The Good Earth]]'' (1931), the accounts are relatively neutral, implying a respect for Chinese culture and assuming that it is not the role of outsiders to promote reform. Sometimes the accounts seem intended to rouse like-minded Chinese and foreign opinion to abolish the custom, and sometimes the accounts imply [[wikt:condescension|condescension]] or [[wikt:contempt|contempt]] for China.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Ebrey, "Gender and Sinology: Shifting Western Interpretations of Footbinding, 1300–1890", ''Late Imperial China'' 20.2  (1999): 1-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''gallon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|æ|l|ə|n}}) is a [[units of measurement|unit of measurement]] for volume and [[fluid capacity]] in both the [[United States customary units|US customary units]] and the [[imperial units|British imperial]] systems of measurement. Three significantly different sizes are in current use: the imperial gallon defined as {{val|4.54609|fmt=commas}} [[litre]]s (4 imperial [[quart]]s or 8 imperial [[pint]]s), which is used in the United Kingdom, [[Canadian units|Canada]], and some [[Caribbean]] nations; the US gallon defined as 231 cubic inches (4 US liquid quarts or 8 US liquid pints) or about {{convert|231|cuin|L|3|disp=out}}, which is used in the US and some [[Latin America]]n and Caribbean countries; and the least-used US dry gallon defined as {{convert|1//8|USbsh|L|3}}.

The IEEE standard symbol for the gallon is '''gal'''.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Std 260.1-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The gallon currently has one definition in the imperial system, and two definitions (liquid and [[Dry_gallon|dry]]) in the US customary system. Historically, there were many definitions and redefinitions.

===English system gallons===
There were more than a few systems of liquid measurements in the pre-1884 United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ricketts|first1=Carl|title=CAPACITY MEASURES OF THE BRITISH ISLES|url=http://www.pewterbank.com/Measure_for_Measure...by_Carl_Ricketts....18.pdf|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial gallon===
[[File:Shell petrol station in the UK.jpg|thumb|A Shell petrol station selling 2* and 4* (leaded petrol) by the gallon in the UK {{Circa|1980}}]]
The [[Imperial units#Volume|imperial (UK) gallon]], now defined as exactly {{val|4.54609|fmt=commas}} [[litre]]s (about 277.42 cubic inches), is used in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and was originally based on the volume of 10 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] (approximately 4.54&amp;nbsp;kg) of water at {{convert|62|°F|°C|lk=on}}. The imperial fluid ounce is defined as {{sfrac|160}} of an imperial gallon; there are four quarts in a gallon, two pints in a quart, and 20 imperial [[fluid ounce]]s in an [[imperial pint]].

===US liquid gallon===
[[File:US petrol pump.jpg|thumb|A fuel station in the United States displaying fuel prices per US gallon]]
The US gallon is legally defined as 231 [[cubic inch]]es, which is exactly {{convert|231|in3|L|9|disp=out|abbr=off|comma=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/h44-12.cfm|title=NIST Handbook 44 - 2012 Edition Appendix C "General Tables of Units of Measurement"|publisher=|page=C-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Uniform Laws and Regulations in the areas of legal metrology and engine fuel quality|year=2011|publisher=US Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology|pages=9–13, 69|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/pubs/upload/HB130-11-final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A US liquid gallon of water weighs about {{convert|8.34|lb|kg|disp=or}} at {{convert|62|°F|°C|lk=off}}, making it about 16.6% lighter than the imperial gallon. There are four [[quart]]s in a gallon, two [[pint]]s in a quart and 16 US [[fluid ounce]]s in a [[US pint]], which makes the US fluid ounce equal to {{sfrac|128}} of a US gallon. In order to overcome the effects of expansion and contraction with temperature when using a gallon to specify a quantity of material for purposes of trade, it is common to define the temperature at which the material will occupy the specified volume. For example, the volume of petroleum products&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nh.gov/agric/news/documents/weights-fuel-temperature.pdf State of New Hampshire Dept of Weights and Measure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413013031/http://www.nh.gov/agric/news/documents/weights-fuel-temperature.pdf |date=13 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and alcoholic beverages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title27-vol1/pdf/CFR-2011-title27-vol1-sec5-21.pdf 27 CFR section 5.21]&lt;/ref&gt; are both referenced to {{convert|60|°F|°C|1|lk=off}} in government regulations.

===US dry gallon===
{{Main article|Dry gallon}}
This [[dry measure]] is one-eighth of a US ''[[Winchester measure|Winchester]]'' [[bushel]] of {{val|2150.42}} cubic inches; it is therefore equal to exactly 268.8025 cubic inches or about {{val|4.405|ul=L}}. The US dry gallon is not used in commerce, and is not listed in the relevant statute, which jumps from the dry quart to the [[peck]].&lt;ref name="15USC205"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=unit%20measure&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode15/usc_sec_15_00000205----000-notes.html ''Authorized tables'']'', US Code'', Title 15, ch. 6, subchapter I, sec. 205, accessed 19 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Turks &amp; Caicos Islands]], both the U.S. gallon and Imperial gallon are used, due to an increase in tax duties disguised by levying the same duty on the 3.79&amp;nbsp;L U.S. gallon as was previously levied on the 4.55&amp;nbsp;L Imperial gallon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebahamasweekly.com/publish/TCI/New_Measures_To_Improve_Tci_Finances_And_Prioritise_Spending_printer.shtml|title=thebahamasweekly.com -   New Measures to Improve TCI Finances And Prioritise Spending|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other units==

Both the US liquid and imperial gallon are divided into four [[quart]]s (''quart''er gallons), which in turn are divided into two [[pint]]s. These pints are divided into two [[cup (unit)|cups]] (though the imperial cup is rarely used now), which in turn are divided into two [[gill (unit)|gills]] (gills are also rarely used). Thus a gallon is equal to four quarts, eight pints, sixteen cups or thirty-two gills. The imperial gill is further divided into five [[fluid ounce]]s, whereas the US gill is divided into four fluid ounces. Thus an imperial fluid ounce is {{sfrac|20}} of an imperial pint or {{sfrac|160}} of an imperial gallon, while a US fluid ounce is {{sfrac|16}} of a US pint or {{sfrac|128}} of a US gallon.

The imperial gallon, quart, pint, cup and gill are approximately 20% larger than their US counterparts and are therefore not interchangeable. The imperial fluid ounce, on the other hand, is only 4% smaller than the US fluid ounce and therefore they are often used interchangeably.

In the US, liquor is often sold in "[[Fifth (unit)|fifth]]s", which are approximately one-fifth of a US gallon.&lt;ref&gt;E. Frank Henriques, ''The Signet Encyclopedia of Wine'', p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term derives most immediately from ''galun, galon'' in [[Old Northern French]], but the usage was common in several languages, for example {{lang|fro|jale}} in [[Old French]] and {{lang|ang|gęllet}} (bowl) in Old English. This suggests a common origin in [[Vulgar Latin|Romance Latin]], but the ultimate source of the word is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|edition=2|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=gallon, n.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gallon originated as the base of systems for measuring [[English wine cask units|wine]], and [[English brewery cask units|beer]] in England. The sizes of gallon used in these two systems were different from each other: the first was based on the [[wine gallon]] (equal in size to the US gallon), and the second on either the ale gallon or the larger imperial gallon.

By the end of the 18th century, three definitions of the gallon were in common use: {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
*The ''corn gallon'', or ''Winchester gallon'', of about {{nowrap|268.8 cubic inches}} {{nowrap|(≈ 4.405 L)}},
*The ''[[wine gallon]]'', or ''[[Queen Anne's gallon]]'', which was {{nowrap|231 cubic inches}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sizes.com/units/gallon_english_wine.htm|title=English wine gallon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|(≈ 3.79 L)}}, and
*The ''ale gallon'' of {{nowrap|282 cubic inches}} {{nowrap|(≈ 4.62 L)}}.

The ''corn'' or ''[[dry gallon]]'' was used in the United States until recently for grain and other dry commodities. It is one-eighth of the [[bushel|(Winchester) bushel]], originally a cylindrical measure of {{sfrac|18|1|2}} inches in diameter and 8&amp;nbsp;inches in depth. That made the dry gallon {{nowrap|({{sfrac|9|1|4}})&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × [[Pi|π]] cubic inches ≈ {{val|268.80252|u=in3}}}}. The bushel, which like dry [[quart]] and pint still sees some use, was later defined to be 2150.42&amp;nbsp;cubic inches exactly, making its gallon exactly {{val|268.8025|u=in3}} ({{val|4.40488377086|u=L}}).
In previous centuries, there had been a corn gallon of around 271 to 272 cubic inches.

The ''[[wine gallon|wine]]'', ''fluid'', or ''liquid gallon'' has been the standard US gallon since the early 19th century. The wine gallon, which some sources relate to the volume occupied by eight medieval [[English unit#Weight|merchant pounds]] of wine, was at one time defined as the volume of a cylinder 6 inches deep and 7 inches in diameter, i.e. {{nowrap|6&amp;nbsp;in × ({{sfrac|3|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;in)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × π ≈ 230.907&amp;nbsp;06 cubic inches}}. It had been redefined during the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], in 1706, as 231 cubic inches exactly, which is the result of the earlier definition with π approximated to {{sfrac|22|7}}. Although the wine gallon had been used for centuries for import duty purposes there was no legal standard of it in the [[Exchequer]] and a smaller gallon {{nowrap|(224 cu in)}} was actually in use, so this statute became necessary. It remains the US definition today.

In 1824, Britain adopted a close approximation to the ''ale gallon'' known as the ''imperial gallon'' and abolished all other gallons in favour of it. Inspired by the [[kilogram]]-litre relationship, the imperial gallon was based on the volume of 10 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] of distilled water weighed in air with brass weights with the barometer standing at 30 [[inch of mercury|inches of mercury]] and at a temperature of {{nowrap|62 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]}}. In 1963, this definition was refined as the space occupied by 10 pounds of distilled water of density {{val|0.998859|u=g/mL}} weighed in air of density {{val|0.001217|u=g/mL}} against weights of density {{nowrap|8.136 g/mL}} (the original "brass" was refined as the density of [[brass]] alloys vary depending on metallurgical composition). This works out at approximately {{val|4.5460903|u=L}} ({{val|277.41945|u=in3}}). The metric definition of exactly {{val|4.54609}} cubic decimetres (also {{val|4.54609|u=L}} after the litre was redefined in 1964, ≈&amp;nbsp;{{val|277.419433|u=in3}}) was adopted shortly afterwards in Canada, but from 1976 the conventional value of {{val|4.546092|u=L}} was used in the United Kingdom until the Canadian convention was adopted in 1985.

Historically, gallons of various sizes were used in many parts of Western Europe. In these localities, it has been replaced as the unit of capacity by the [[litre]].

'''Habitability''' is the conformance of a [[House|residence]] or [[wikt:abode|abode]] to the implied [[warranty]] of habitability. A residence that complies is said to be '''habitable'''. It is an [[implied warranty]] or contract, meaning it does not have to be an [[express contract]], [[Covenant (law)|covenant]], or [[provision (contracting)|provision]] of a [[contract]].  There was no implied warranty of habitability for tenants at [[common law]] and the [[legal doctrine]] has since developed in many jurisdictions through housing laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landlord-Tenant Law|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/landlord-tenant_law|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duties of the Landlord|url=https://lawshelf.com/courseware/entry/duties-of-the-landlord|website=LawShelf|publisher=National Paralegal College|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Habitability is synonymous with '''tenantability'''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be habitable, such housing usually:
* must provide shelter, with working locks
* must be heated in the winter months (typically between October 1 and May 31 in the [[Northeastern United States]])&lt;ref&gt;In New York, see N.Y. Multiple Dwelling Law § 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
* must not be infested with [[vermin]], roaches, termites, or [[mold]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3898/is_200406/ai_n9435714 Mold in condominium: Negligent maintenance: Breach of warranty of habitability: Settlement: Verdict | Law Reporter | Find Articles at BNET.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Violation of the warranty of habitability results in [[constructive eviction]], whereby the [[landlord]] or [[wikt:Special:Search/lessor|lessor]] has, in effect, evicted the [[leasehold estate|tenant]] or [[lessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Josephson|first1=Richard C.|title=The Implied Warranty of Habitability in Landlord-Tenant Relations|journal=William &amp; Mary Law Review|date=1971|volume=12|issue=3|page=580|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2742&amp;context=wmlr|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tenant may remedy the problem,&lt;ref&gt;See N.Y.

The Japanese noun {{nihongo|'''hotoke'''|仏}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Note that the very same ''[[kanji]]'' 仏 in modern Japanese can be also read ''futsu'', but is often used as an abbreviation for the word "furansu", or France. It is the first of three characters used to write the name of that country ({{nihongo|仏蘭西|fu-ran-su}}), in a somewhat uncommon practice called ''[[ateji]]'', in which ''kanji'' are matched to the phonetic sound of a word with little regard for the indicative meaning of the ''kanji''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a word of Buddhist origin and uncertain [[etymology]].&lt;ref name="ik"/&gt; It has several meanings, all but a few directly linked to [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]]. It can refer to: Yuki

*A person who has achieved ''[[satori]]'' (state of enlightenment) and has therefore become a "buddha".&lt;ref name="ik"&gt;Iwanami {{nihongo|[[Kōjien]]|広辞苑}} Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version&lt;/ref&gt; (In Buddhism, the term "buddha" in the lower case refers to a person who has become enlightened (i.e., awakened to the truth).)&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary 2nd edition, 2005, Oxford University Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The term is also sometimes used to represent Buddhism as a whole. For example, the expression {{nihongo|"''kami'' and ''hotoke''"|神と仏}} draws a distinction between Japanese ''[[kami]]'' and the enlightened beings of foreign Buddhism.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The historical [[Gautama Buddha]] himself&lt;ref name="ik"/&gt; 
*The statue or the name of a buddha&lt;ref name="ik"/&gt; 
*The laws of Buddhism&lt;ref name="ik"/&gt;
*Figuratively, the performing of a Buddhist memorial service. The ''[[Eiga Monogatari]]'' for example contains a sentence in which the term is used in that sense.&lt;ref name="ik"/&gt;
*In common parlance, a dead person; his or her soul&lt;ref name="ik"/&gt;
*Figuratively, a benevolent person or someone dear to one's heart&lt;ref name="ik"/&gt;
*''Hotoke'' can also be a person's name or a nickname. It is for example a [[Shirabyōshi#Gi.C5.8D_and_Hotoke|female character]] in the ''[[Heike Monogatari]]''&lt;ref name="ik"/&gt; and [[daimyō]] [[Kōriki Kiyonaga]]'s nickname.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">In computer science, '''hub labels''' or the '''hub-labelling algorithm''' is a method that consumes much fewer resources than the [[lookup table]] but is still extremely fast for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.&lt;ref&gt;Ittai Abraham, Daniel Delling, Andrew V. Goldberg, Renato F. Werneck, [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/HL-TR.pdf « A Hub-Based Labeling Algorithm for Shortest Paths on Road Networks »], Microsoft Research Silicon Valley, 1065 La Avenida, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ittai Abraham, Daniel Delling, Andrew V. Goldberg, Renato F. Werneck, [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/HL-TR.pdf « Hierarchical Hub Labelings for Shortest Paths »], Microsoft Research Silicon Valley, 1065 La Avenida, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

This method allows at the most with two SELECT statements and the analysis of two strings to compute the shortest path between two vertices of a graph.
For a graph that is oriented like a road graph, this technique requires the prior computation of two tables from structures constructed using the method of the [[contraction hierarchies]]. 
In the end, these two computed tables will have as many rows as nodes present within the graph. For each row (each node), a label will be calculated.

A label is a string containing the distance information between the current node (the node of the row) and all the other nodes that can be reached with an ascending search on the relative multi-level structure. The advantage of these distances is that they all represent the shortest paths. 

So, for future queries, the search of a shortest path will start from the source on the first table and the destination on the second table, from which it will be search within the labels for the common nodes with the associated distance information. Only the smallest sum of distances will be kept as the shortest path result.

'''Inner peace''' (or '''peace of mind''') refers to a deliberate state of psychological or spiritual calm despite the potential presence of [[Stressor|stressors]]. Being "at peace" is considered by many to be healthy ([[homeostasis]]) and the opposite of being stressed or anxious, and is considered to be a state where our mind performs at an optimal level with a positive outcome.  Peace of mind is thus generally associated with [[wiktionary:bliss|bliss]], [[happiness]] and [[contentment]].

Peace of mind, [[wiktionary:serenity|serenity]], and [[calmness]] are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress.  In some cultures, inner peace is considered a state of [[consciousness]] or [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] that may be cultivated by various forms of training, such as [[prayer]], [[meditation]], [[tai chi]] or [[yoga]], for example.  Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of [[Know thyself|knowing oneself]].  Finding inner peace (Shanti, Santhi or Shanthi, from {{lang-sa|शान्तिः}}, {{IAST|śāntiḥ}}, {{IPA-sa|ʃaːnt̪iɧ}}; √ शम śam: ‘be calm’) means peace, rest, calmness, tranquility, or bliss is often associated with traditions such as  [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Jainism]].

People have difficulties embracing their inner spirituality because everyday stressors get the best of them; finding peace and happiness in the little joys of life can seem like a lot of work, and results do not seem all that gratifying.  Achieving spirituality is a step-by-step process; there are ways through which one can become more spiritual every day.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

[[Tenzin Gyatso]], the current and 14th [[Dalai Lama]], emphasizes the importance of inner peace in the world: 
{{quote|text=The question of real, lasting world peace concerns human beings, so basic human feelings are also at its roots.  Through inner peace, genuine world peace can be achieved.  In this the importance of individual responsibility is quite clear; an atmosphere of peace must first be created within ourselves, then gradually expanded to include our families, our communities, and ultimately the whole planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <comment>Corrected title of Lacan's "The signification of the phallus" (I.e. not "the significance of the phallus") and added reference for his Écrits</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4689">In [[Jacques Lacan]]'s [[psychoanalytic]] [[philosophy]], '''lack''' ({{lang-fr|manque}}) is a concept that is always related to desire. In his seminar ''Le transfert'' (1960–61) he states that lack is what causes desire to arise.

==Types of lack==
Lacan first designated a lack of [[being]]: what is desired is being itself. "Desire is a relation to being to lack. The lack is the lack of being properly speaking. It is not the lack of this or that, but lack of being whereby the being exists." (Seminar: ''The Ego in Freud's Theory'') In "The Direction of the Treatment and the Principles of Its Power" (''Écrits'') Lacan argues that desire is the [[metonymy]] of the lack of being (''manque à être''): the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]'s lack of being is at the heart of the analytic experience and the very field in which the [[neuroticism|neurotic]]'s passion is deployed. In "Guiding Remarks for a Convention on Feminine Sexuality" Lacan contrasts the lack of being related to desire with the lack of having (''manque à avoir'') which he relates to demand.

Starting in his seminar ''La relation d'objet'', Lacan distinguishes between three kinds of lack, according to the nature of the object which is lacking. The first one is [[The Symbolic|Symbolic]] [[Castration]] and its object related is the '''[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|Imaginary]] [[Phallus#In Psyhchoanalysis|Phallus]]'''; the second one is Imaginary Frustration and its object related is the '''Real Breast'''; the third kind of lack is Real Privation and its object related is the '''Symbolic Phallus'''. The three corresponding agents are the Real Father, the Symbolic Mother, and the Imaginary Father. Of these three forms of lack, castration is the most important from the perspective of the cure.

It is in ''La relation d'objet'' that Lacan introduces the algebraic symbol for the barred [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], and lack comes to designate the lack of the signifier in the Other. Then the relation of the subject to the lack of the signifier in the Other, designates the signifier of a lack in the Other. No matter how many [[Sign (semiotics)|signifiers]] one adds to the signifying chain, the chain is always incomplete, it always lacks the signifier that could complete it. This missing signifier is then constitutive of the subject.

The symbolic version of the phallus, a phallic symbol is meant to represent male generative powers. According to Sigmund Freud's theory of psychoanalysis, while males possess a penis, no one can possess the symbolic phallus. Jacques Lacan's ''Écrits'' includes an essay titled ''The Signification of the Phallus'' which articulates the difference between "being" and "having" the phallus. Men are positioned as men insofar as they are seen to have the phallus. Women, not having the phallus, are seen to "be" the phallus. The symbolic phallus is the concept of being the ultimate man, and having this is compared to having the divine gift of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Écrits|last=Lacan|first=Jacques|publisher=Tavistock Publications|year=1977|isbn=|location=London|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gender Trouble|''Gender Trouble'' (1990)]], [[Judith Butler]] explores Freud's and Lacan's discussions of the symbolic phallus by pointing out the connection between the phallus and the penis. She writes, "The law requires conformity to its own notion of 'nature'. It gains its legitimacy through the binary and asymmetrical naturalization of bodies in which the phallus, though clearly not identical to the penis, deploys the penis as its naturalized instrument and sign" (135). In ''Bodies that Matter'', she further explores the possibilities for the phallus in her discussion of the lesbian phallus. If, as she notes, Freud enumerates a set of analogies and substitutions that rhetorically affirm the fundamental transferability of the phallus from the penis elsewhere, then any number of other things might come to stand in for the phallus (62).

==Criticism==
In ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'', [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] postulate that desire does not arise from lack, but rather is a productive force in itself.

The shrine is located just to the west of [[Toyokuni Shrine (Kyoto)|Toyokuni Shrine]], the [[Shinto]] shrine honoring Hideyoshi in Kyoto.

==History==
[[File:Mimizuka-M1773.jpg|thumb|upright|left]]
Traditionally, [[samurai|Japanese warriors]] brought back the heads of enemies slain on the battlefield as proof of their deeds.  [[Rhinotomy|Nose collection]] in lieu of heads became a feature of the second Korean invasion.&lt;ref name="Turnbull"/&gt;{{rp|p. 195}} &lt;ref name="Hawley158"/&gt; Remuneration was paid to soldiers by their ''[[daimyō]]'' commanders based on the severed heads upon submission to collection stations, where inspectors meticulously counted, recorded, salted and packed the noses bound for Japan.&lt;ref name="Hawley475"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawley494"/&gt; However, because of the number of civilians killed along with soldiers, and crowded conditions on the ships that transported troops, it was far easier to just bring back noses instead of whole heads.&lt;ref name="Hawley158"/&gt; Hideyoshi was especially insistent upon receiving noses of people his samurai had killed as proof that his men really were killing people in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592-98'', London: Osprey, 2008 p.81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese chroniclers on the second invading campaign mention that the ears hacked off the faces of the massacred were also of ordinary civilians&lt;ref name="Wakizaka"/&gt; mostly in the provinces [[Gyeongsang]], [[Jeolla]], and [[Chungcheong]].&lt;ref name="Hawley"/&gt;{{rp|pp. 475–476}}  In the second invasion [[Hideyoshi|Hideyoshi's]] orders were thus:
{{cquote|Mow down everyone universally, without discriminating between young and old, men and women, clergy and the laity—high ranking soldiers on the battlefield, that goes without saying, but also the hill folk, down to the poorest and meanest—and send the heads to Japan.&lt;ref name="Hawley465"/&gt;}}
One hundred and sixty-thousand Japanese troops had gone to Korea where they had taken 185,738 Korean heads and 29,014 Chinese ones, a grand total of 214,752.&lt;ref name="Turnbull"/&gt;{{rp|p. 230}}&lt;ref name="ZGR"/&gt;  As some might have been discarded, it is improbable to enumerate how many were killed in total during the war.&lt;ref name="kristof"/&gt;

Adopted from Turnbull (2002)&lt;ref name="Turnbull"/&gt;]] --&gt;The Mimizuka was dedicated September 28, 1597.&lt;ref name="kristof"/&gt; Though the exact reasons as to its construction are not entirely known, scholars contend that during the second Japanese invasion of Korea in 1597, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] demanded his commanders show receipts of their martial valor in the destruction, dispatching congratulatory letters to his high-ranking warriors in the field as evidence of their service.  Hideyoshi then ordered the relics entombed in a shrine on the grounds of [[Hōkō-ji (Kyoto)|Hokoji Temple]], and set Buddhist priests to work praying for the repose of the souls of the hundreds of thousands of Koreans from whose bodies they had come; an act that chief priest [[Saishō Jōtai]] (1548–1608) in a fit of toadyism would hail as a sign of Hideyoshi's "great mercy and compassion."&lt;ref name="Hawley"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Samuel |last=Hawley |title=The Imjin War: Japan's Sixteenth Century Invasion of Korea and Attempt to Conquer China |year=2005 |page=501 |isbn=89-954424-2-5 |publisher=Royal Asiatic Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shrine initially was known as {{nihongo|''hanazuka''|鼻塚}}, Mound of Noses, but several decades later this would come to be regarded as too cruel-sounding a name, and would be changed to the more euphonious but inaccurate {{nihongo|''mimizuka''|耳塚}}, Mound of Ears, the misnomer by which it is known to this day.&lt;ref name="Hawley" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Elisonas&gt;{{Cite book|first3=Jurgis |last3=Elisonas |title=The Inseparable Trinity: Japan's Relations with China and Korea, (''in'' The Cambridge History of Japan.

===Effect on modern foreign relations===
The Mimizuka is almost unknown to the Japanese public unlike to the Koreans.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt; The British historian Stephen Turnbull called the Mimizuka "...Kyoto's least mentioned and most often avoided tourist attraction".&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Stephen ''The Samurai Invasion of Korea, 1592-98'', London: Osprey, 2008 p.81.&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque, which was later removed, stood in front of the Ear Mound in the 1960s with the passage, "One cannot say that cutting off noses was so atrocious by the standard of the time."  Most guidebooks do not mention the Ear Mound, and only a few Japanese or foreign tourists visit the site.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt; The majority of visiting tourists are Korean&amp;nbsp;– Korean tour buses are often seen parked near the Ear Mound.

In 1982, not a single Japanese school [[textbook]] mentioned the Ear Mound.  As of 1997, the mound is referred to in about half of all high-school history textbooks according to Shigeo Shimoyama, an official of [[Jikkyo (publisher)|Jikkyo]], a publishing company.  The publisher released the first Japanese text book mentioning the Ear Mound in the mid-1980s.  The Education Ministry of Japan at that time opposed the description as "too vivid" and pressured the publisher to reduce the tone and also to praise Hideyoshi for religiously dedicating the Ear Mound to store the spirits of the killed people.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt;

In the 1970s under the [[Park Chung-hee]] administration, some of the officials of the South Korean government asked Japan to level the monument.&lt;ref name="kristof"/&gt; However, most Koreans said that the mound should stay in Japan as a reminder of past savagery.&lt;ref name="kristof"/&gt;
Activity since the 1990s is aptly conveyed thus:&lt;ref name="Hawley"/&gt;{{rp|pp. 585–586}}
{{cquote|In 1990 a Korean Buddhist monk named Pak Sam-jung traveled to Kyoto and, with the support of a private local organization, concluded a ceremony in front of the tomb to comfort the spirits residing there and guide them home to Korea.  Over the next six years the Japanese organization that hosted this event spearheaded a drive to get the mimizuka itself sent home, submitting a petition bearing twenty-thousand signatures to Kyoto city officials, and pledging to bear the cost of excavating the contents of the tomb and shipping them to Korea, together with the nine-meter-high earthen mound and the stone pagoda on top.  When Pak Sam-jung returned to Kyoto in 1996, the tomb's return seemed imminent. "These noses were cut off as trophies of war for Toyotomi Hideyoshi," he announced upon leaving Seoul.  "They have been there in Kyoto for four-hundred years. It is now our duty to see them returned to Korea to assuage the grief of the 126,000 people whose remains are buried there."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In the end the necessary permission to move the mimuzuka was not forthcoming from the Japanese government. It was decided that, as an officially designated national cultural asset, the tomb should stay where it was. It remains in Kyoto to this day, little known and not often visited, and not well marked for tourists. It is just west of [[Kyoto National Museum]] and [[Toyokuni Shrine (Kyoto)|Toyokuni Jinja]], the Shinto shrine dedicated to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who was deified as a [[kami]] after his death. Funding from the government is insufficient to care for the site, so the work is done by local residents, who volunteer to cut the grass and tidy up the grounds.&lt;ref name="Hawley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt;}}

On September 28, 1997, the 400th anniversary of the Mimizuka, a ceremony was held in respect for those killed, which people of all nationalities and faiths attended. The current caretaker of Mimizuka as of August 2009 is Shimizu Shirou (清水四郎).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="만행 사과하고파"..."귀무덤" 지킨 日노인|date=2009-08-14|url=http://www.donga.com/fbin/output?n=200908140228|accessdate=2009-12-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608203248/http://www.donga.com/fbin/output?n=200908140228|archivedate=2011-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The severed heads were lined up for the customary post-battle viewing, and then the noses were cut off and packed in salt for shipment back to Japan. Under normal circumstances the heads themselves would have been kept, but in the Korean campaign there were simply too many. Henceforth noses would become the generally accepted trophies of war. They were much more portable."&lt;/ref&gt;

"From the start the offensive to pacify the provinces of [[Gyeongsang]], [[Jeolla]], and [[Chungcheong]] was accompanied by the most horrific atrocities perpetrated against the region’s civilian population.  People were killed almost daily well outside the time frame of any significant battle, and their noses hacked off by the hundreds, even the thousands. We know this because the units responsible, ever mindful of recording the proof of their valor, kept meticulous records and receipts, some of which have survived to this day ."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Wakizaka"&gt;In Turnbull, Stephen (2002), p. 197. Japanese monk Keinen noted that atrocities against the civilian population was just another phase in the military operation. "From early dawn of the following morning we gave chase and hunted them in the mountains and scoured the villages for the distance of one day's travel. When they were cornered we made a wholesale slaughter of them. During a period of ten days we seized 10,000 of the enemy, but we did not cut off their heads.  We cut off their noses, which told us how many heads there were. By this time Yasuharu's total of heads was over 2,000." (''Wakizaka ki'' in Yoshino, Jingoza'emon.

The '''mirror stage''' ({{lang-fr|stade du miroir}}) is a concept in the [[psychoanalytic]] theory of [[Jacques Lacan]]. The mirror stage is based on the belief that infants recognize themselves in a [[mirror]] (literal) or other symbolic contraption which induces [[apperception]] (the turning of oneself into an object that can be viewed by the child from outside themselves) from the age of about six months.

Initially, Lacan proposed that the mirror stage was part of an infant's development from 6 to 18 months, as outlined at the Fourteenth International Psychoanalytical Congress at [[Marienbad]] in 1936. By the early 1950s, Lacan's concept of the mirror stage had evolved: he no longer considered the mirror stage as a moment in the life of the [[infant]], but as representing a permanent structure of [[subjectivity]], or as the [[paradigm]] of "[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|Imaginary order]]". This evolution in Lacan's thinking becomes clear in his later essay titled "The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire".

==History of development==
Lacan's concept of the mirror stage was strongly inspired by earlier work by psychologist [[Henri Wallon (psychologist)|Henri Wallon]], who speculated based on observations of animals and humans responding to their reflections in mirrors.&lt;ref name ="Webster"&gt;Webster, Richard. (2002) "[http://www.richardwebster.net/thecultoflacan.html The cult of Lacan: Freud, Lacan and the mirror stage.]"&lt;/ref&gt; Wallon noted that by the age of about six months, human infants and chimpanzees both ''seem'' to recognize their reflection in a mirror. While chimpanzees rapidly lose interest in the discovery, human infants typically become very interested and devote much time and effort to exploring the connections between their bodies and their images.&lt;ref name="Evans, 2005"&gt;[[Dylan Evans|Evans, Dylan]] (2005). "[http://beta.finance-on.net/upload/ver/ver4480020c6d2b2/lacan.pdf From Lacan to Darwin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502205406/http://beta.finance-on.net/upload/ver/ver4480020c6d2b2/lacan.pdf |date=2014-05-02 }}," in ''The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative'', eds. Jonathan Gottschall and David Sloan Wilson,  Evanston: Northwestern University Press, pp38-55.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1931 paper, Wallon argued that mirrors helped children develop a sense of self-identity. However, later [[mirror test]] research indicates that while toddlers are usually fascinated by mirrors, they do not actually recognize themselves in mirrors until the age of 15 months at the earliest,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael, Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, and John Jaskir. "Individual Differences in Visual Self-recognition as a Function of Mother-infant Attachment Relationship." Developmental Psychobiology 21.6 (1985) 1181-87&lt;/ref&gt; leading psychoanalytically trained critic Norman N. Holland to declare that "there is no evidence whatsoever for Lacan's notion of a mirror stage".&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Norman N. (1998) [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/nholland/lacan.htm The Trouble(s) With Lacan]".&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, physician [[Raymond Tallis]]&lt;ref&gt;Tallis, Raymond.
 (1988) ''Not Saussure: A Critique of Post-Saussurean Literary Theory'', Macmillan, 1988, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that a literal interpretation of the Lacanian mirror stage contradicts empirical observations about human identity and personality: "If epistemological maturation and the formation of a world picture were dependent upon catching sight of oneself in a mirror, then the [mirror stage] theory would predict that congenitally blind individuals would lack selfhood and be unable to enter language, society or the world at large. There is no evidence whatsoever that this implausible consequence of the theory is borne out in practice."

Wallon's ideas about mirrors in infant development were distinctly non-[[Freudian]] and little-known until revived in modified form a few years later by Lacan. As Evans&lt;ref name="Evans, 2005"/&gt; writes, "Lacan used this observation as a springboard to develop an account of the development of human subjectivity that was inherently, though often implicitly, comparative in nature." Lacan attempted to link Wallon's ideas to Freudian psychoanalysis, but was met with indifference from the larger community of Freudian psychoanalysts. Richard Webster&lt;ref name ="Webster"/&gt; explains how the "complex, and at times impenetrable paper ... appears to have made little or no lasting impression on the psychoanalysts who first heard it. It was not mentioned in [[Ernest Jones]]'s brief account of the congress and received no public discussion."

In the 1930s, Lacan attended seminars by [[Alexandre Kojève]], whose philosophy was heavily influenced by [[Hegel]]. The diachronic structure of the mirror stage theory is influenced by Kojève's interpretation of the [[Master-slave dialectic]]. Lacan continued to refine and modify the mirror stage concept through the remainder of his career; see below.

[[Dylan Evans]]&lt;ref name="Evans, 2005"/&gt; argues that Lacan's earliest versions of the mirror stage, while flawed, can be regarded as a bold pioneering in the field of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behavior) and a precursor of both [[cognitive psychology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]]. In the 1930s, zoologists were increasingly interested in the then-new field of ethology, but not until the 1960s would the larger scientific community believe that animal behavior offered any insights into human behavior.

However, Evans also notes that by the 1950s Lacan's mirror stage concept had become abstracted to the point that it no longer required a literal mirror, but could simply be the child's observation of observed behavior in the imitative gestures of another child or elder.&lt;ref name="Evans Dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Dylan|title=An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis.|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-Alienation==

The child’s initiation into what Jacques Lacan would call the "mirror stage" entails a "libidinal dynamism" caused by the young child's identification with his own image and creation of what Lacan terms the "Ideal-I" or "Ideal ego." This reflexivity inherent in fantasy is apparent in the mirror stage, since to recognize oneself as "I" is like recognizing oneself as other ("yes, that person over there is me"); this act is thus fundamentally self-alienating. Indeed, for this reason feelings towards the image are mixed, caught between hatred ("I hate that version of myself because it is so much better than me") and love ("I want to be like that image"). A type of repetition compulsion develops from this vacillation as the attempt to locate a fixed subject proves ever elusive. "The mirror stage is a drama…which manufactures for the subject, caught up in the lure of spatial identification, the succession of phantasies that extends from a fragmented body-image to a form of its totality.” This misrecognition (seeing an ideal-I where there is a fragmented, chaotic body) subsequently "characterizes the ego in all its structures."

==As phenomenon==
{{quote|The mirror stage is a phenomenon to which I assign a twofold value. In the first place, it has historical value as it marks a decisive turning-point in the mental development of the child. In the second place, it typifies an essential [[libido|libidinal]] relationship with the [[body image]]. (Lacan, ''Some reflections on the Ego'', 1953)}}

As Lacan further develops the mirror stage concept, the stress falls less on its historical value and ever more on its structural value. "Historical value" refers to the mental development of the [[child]] and "structural value" to the libidinal relationship with the body image.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Dylan. 1996. ''An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis''. {{ISBN|0-415-13523-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lacan's fourth Seminar, ''La relation d'objet'', he states that "the mirror stage is far from a mere phenomenon which occurs in the development of the child. It illustrates the conflictual nature of the dual relationship". The dual relationship (''relation duelle'') refers not only to the relation between the [[Id, ego and super-ego|Ego]] and the [[Human body|body]], which is always characterized by [[illusion]]s of similarity and reciprocity, but also to the relation between the Imaginary and [[the Real]]. The visual identity given from the mirror supplies imaginary "wholeness" to the experience of a fragmentary real. See Lacan's paper, "The Mirror Stage as formative of the function of the ''I'' as revealed in psychoanalytic experience", the first of his ''Écrits.''

The mirror stage describes the formation of the Ego via the process of identification, the Ego being the result of identifying with one's own specular image. At six months the [[baby]] still lacks [[motor coordination|coordination]] (see [[Louis Bolk]]); however, Lacan hypothesized that the baby can recognize itself in the mirror before attaining control over its bodily movements. The child sees its image as a whole, but this contrasts with the lack of coordination of the body and leads the child to perceive a fragmented body. This contrast, Lacan hypothesized, is first felt by the infant as a rivalry with its own image, because the wholeness of the image threatens it with fragmentation; thus the mirror stage gives rise to an aggressive tension between the subject and the image. To resolve this aggressive tension, the subject identifies with the image: this primary identification with the counterpart is what forms the Ego. (Evans, 1996) The moment of identification is to Lacan a moment of jubilation since it leads to an imaginary sense of mastery. (''Écrits'', "The Mirror Stage") Yet, the jubilation may also be accompanied by a depressive reaction, when the infant compares his own precarious sense of mastery with the [[omnipotence]] of the [[mother]]. (''La relation d'objet'') This identification also involves the ideal ego which functions as a promise of future wholeness sustaining the Ego in anticipation.

The mirror stage, Lacan also hypothesized, shows that the Ego is the product of misunderstanding – Lacan's term "méconnaissance" implies a false recognition. Additionally, the mirror stage is where the subject becomes [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienated]] from itself, and thus is introduced into the Imaginary order.

The Mirror Stage has also a significant [[symbol]]ic dimension. [[The Symbolic]] order is present in the figure of the adult who is carrying the infant: the moment after the subject has jubilantly assumed his image as his own, he turns his head toward this adult who represents the big [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], as if to call on him to ratify this image. (Tenth Seminar, "L'angoisse", 1962–1963)

'''Moral absolutism''' is an [[Ethics|ethical]] view that all [[action (philosophy)|actions]] are intrinsically right or wrong. Stealing, for instance, might be considered to be always [[Immorality|immoral]], even if done for the well-being of others (e.g., stealing food to feed a starving family), and even if it does in the end promote such a good. Moral absolutism stands in contrast to other categories of [[normative ethics|normative ethical theories]] such as [[consequentialism]], which holds that the [[morality]] (in the wide sense) of an act depends on the consequences or the context of the act.

Moral absolutism is not the same as [[moral universalism]]. Universalism holds merely that what is right or wrong is independent of custom or opinion (as opposed to [[moral relativism]]), but not necessarily that what is right or wrong is independent of context or consequences (as in absolutism). Moral universalism is compatible with moral absolutism, but also positions such as consequentialism. [[Louis Pojman]] gives the following definitions to distinguish the two positions of moral absolutism and universalism:&lt;ref name="PojmanDefense"&gt;Pojman, L. P. ''A Defense of Ethical Objectivism'' (p. 50).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moral absolutism: There is at least one principle that ought never to be violated.
* Moral objectivism: There is a fact of the matter as to whether any given action is morally permissible or impermissible: a fact of the matter that does not depend solely on social custom or individual acceptance.

Ethical theories which place strong emphasis on [[rights]] and [[duty]], such as the [[deontological ethics]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], are often forms of moral absolutism, as are many [[religion|religious]] moral codes.

==Religion==
Moral absolutism may be understood in a strictly secular context, as in many forms of deontological [[moral rationalism]]. However, many religions have morally absolutist positions as well, regarding their system of morality as [[divine command theory|deriving from divine commands]]. Therefore, they regard such a moral system as absolute, (usually) perfect, and unchangeable. Many secular philosophies also take a morally absolutist stance, arguing that absolute laws of morality are inherent in the nature of human beings, the nature of life in general, or the universe itself. For example, someone who believes absolutely in [[nonviolence]] considers it wrong to use violence even in self-defense.

[[Catholic philosopher]] [[Thomas Aquinas]] never explicitly addresses the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], but draws a distinction between what is good or evil in itself and what is good or evil because of God's commands,{{sfn|Aquinas|c. 1265–1274|loc=2a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3057.htm#article2 57.2]}} with unchangeable moral standards forming the bulk of [[natural law]].{{sfn|Aquinas|c. 1265–1274|loc=2a1ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2094.htm#article5 94.5]}} Thus he contends that not even God can change the [[Ten Commandments]], adding, however, that God ''can'' change what individuals deserve in particular cases, in what might look like special dispensations to murder or steal.{{sfn|Aquinas|c. 1265–1274|loc=1a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2100.htm#article8 100.8]}}

It is based on maintaining coherence across [[Scale (analytical tool)|scales]] and different dimensions (e.g. economic, demographic, energetic) of quantitative assessments generated using different metrics. It is designed to detect and analyze patterns in the societal use of resources and the impacts they create on the environment. The approach was created around 1997 by Mario Giampietro and Kozo Mayumi, and has been developed since then by the members of the IASTE (Integrated Assessment: Sociology, Technology and the Environment) group at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology of the ''Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona'' and its external collaborators. MuSIASEM strives to characterize metabolic patterns of Socio-Ecological Systems (how and why humans use resources and how this use depends on and affects the stability of the ecosystems embedding the society). This integrated approach allows for a quantitative implementation of the [[DPSIR]] framework (Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts and Responses) and application as a decision support tool. Different alternatives of the option space can be checked in terms of feasibility (compatibility with processes outside human control), viability (compatibility with processes under human control) and desirability (compatibility with normative values and institutions). The ability to integrate quantitative assessments across dimensions and scales makes MuSIASEM particularly suited for different types of sustainability analysis: (i) the nexus between food, energy, water and land uses; (ii) urban metabolism; (iii) waste metabolism; (iv) tourism metabolism; (v) rural development.

'''Mutation Sensation''' is a [[recycling]] project based on reusing discarded “[[stuffed animals]]” toys.

The concept has become an evolutionary project that reconstructs the way people think about the [[market economy]] in reference to mass production (of toys, in this case) which symbolizes the early education of abundance as pleasure.  It is also awakening an avenue that opens eyes to the possibilities of alternative equal rights relations between the producers and the consumers of the world.  With respect to the inequality of the market, the 1st Mutation Sensation session occurred during a festival under various gamey stipulations such as:  long hours, unfavourable work conditions and no pay.  It was an intense lesson as to how much work is involved in sewing toys.  The Mutations have continued to develop amongst recycling festivals and childhood ecological recycling projects.

Mutation Sensations serve an important demand for performing illusionary transformations and possible elimination of iconographic plush toys into futuristic idealism.

[[File:Onion Metaphor - Social Penetration Theory.png|thumb|An onion model used in [[social penetration theory]]]]
The '''onion model''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]-based [[diagram]] template for describing an expanding or extending relationship between several concepts. The name is a [[metaphor]] of the layered shells that become visible when you cut open an [[onion]]. The outer layers in the model typically add size or complexity incrementally to the central layers.

The [[onion diagram]] can be presented as an [[Euler diagram]] or a stacked [[Venn diagram]]. For the record, a stacked Venn contains a series of sets A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...A&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; where each set A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is a strict [[subset]] of A&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; (and by recursion, of all A&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; where m &gt; n). However, as the onion is often used as a metaphor, it doesn't necessarily make sense to interpret the contents of an onion diagram literally or mathematically. 

This diagram format is supported e.g. by [[Microsoft PowerPoint]]'s [[SmartArt]] wizard under the name of "stacked Venn".

==In computing==
The onion model in computing is used as a metaphor for the complex structure of information systems. The system is split into layers to make it easier to understand.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.slideshare.net/MdRokibulIslam2/mis-management-information-system-lecture-1&lt;/ref&gt; A simple example is to start with the program, operating system and hardware layers. Each of these layers can then be subdivided.

{{history of war}}
'''Peacekeeping''' refers to activities intended to create conditions that favour lasting peace.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/|title=United Nations Peacekeeping|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths and reduces the risk of renewed warfare.

Within the [[United Nations]] (UN) group of nation-state governments and organisations, there is a general understanding that at the international level, peacekeepers monitor and observe [[Peacebuilding|peace processes]] in post-conflict areas, and may assist ex-combatants in implementing [[peace agreement]] commitments that they have undertaken. Such assistance may come in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the [[rule of law]], and economic and social development. Accordingly, the [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN peacekeepers]] (often referred to as '''Blue Berets '''or '''Blue Helmets''' because of their light blue [[beret]]s or helmets) can include soldiers, [[United Nations Police|police]] officers, and civilian personnel.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations Peacekeeping |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/about/dpko/ |title=Department of Peacekeeping Operations(DPKO) |publisher=United Nations Peacekeeping |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations Peacekeeping |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/about/dfs/ |title=Department of Field Support(DFS) |publisher=United Nations Peacekeeping |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations is not the only organisation to implement peacekeeping missions. Non-UN peacekeeping forces include the [[Kosovo Force|NATO mission in Kosovo]] (with United Nations authorisation) and the [[Multinational Force and Observers]] on the [[Sinai Peninsula]] or the ones organised by the [[European Union]] (like [[EUFOR RCA]], with UN authorisation) and the [[African Union]] (like the [[African Union Mission in Sudan]]). The [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]] is one NGO widely considered to have expertise in general peacemaking by non-governmental volunteers or activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Home Jobs Donate Offices |url=http://www.nonviolentpeaceforce.org/ |title=Nonviolent Peaceforce |publisher=Nonviolent Peaceforce |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and types of peacekeeping operations==

=== United Nations peacekeeping missions ===

====Chapter VI and Chapter VII mission types====
There are a range of various types of operations encompassed in peacekeeping. In Page Fortna's book ''Does Peacekeeping Work?'', for instance, she distinguishes four different types of peacekeeping operations.&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 6–7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work?: Shaping Belligerents' Choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Page|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, these types of missions and how they are conducted are heavily influenced by the mandate in which they are authorized. Three of Fortna's four types are consent-based missions, i.e. so-called "[[Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VI]]" missions, with the fourth being a "[[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII]]" Mission. 
Chapter VI missions are consent based, therefore they require the consent of the belligerent factions involved in order to operate. Should they lose that consent, Peacekeepers would be compelled to withdraw. Chapter VII missions, by contrast, do not require consent, though they may have it. If consent is lost at any point, Chapter VII missions would not be required to withdraw.
# ''Observation Missions'' which consist of small contingents of military or civilian observers tasked with monitoring cease-fires, troop withdrawals, or other conditions outlined in a ceasefire agreement. They are typically unarmed and are primarily tasked with observing and reporting on what is taking place. Thus, they do not possess the capability or mandate to intervene should either side renege on the agreement. Examples of observation missions include [[United Nations Angola Verification Mission II|UNAVEM II]] in [[Angola]] in 1991 and [[United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara|MINURSO]] in the [[Western Sahara]].
# ''Interpositional Missions'', also known as traditional peacekeeping, are larger contingents of lightly armed troops meant to serve as a buffer between belligerent factions in the aftermath of a conflict. Thus, they serve as a buffer zone between the two sides and can monitor and report on the compliance of either side with regard to parameters established in a given ceasefire agreement. Examples include [[United Nations Angola Verification Mission III|UNAVEM III]] in Angola in 1994, and [[MINUGUA]] in [[Guatemala]] in 1996.
# ''Multidimensional missions'' are carried out by military and [[United Nations Police|police]] personnel in which they attempt to implement robust and comprehensive settlements. Not only do they act as observers, or in an interpositional role, but they also participate in more multidimensional tasks—such as electoral supervision, police and security forces reform, institution building, economic development and more. Examples include [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group|UNTAG]] in [[Namibia]], [[ONUCA and ONUSAL|ONUSAL]] in [[El Salvador]], and [[United Nations Operation in Mozambique|ONUMOZ]] in [[Mozambique]].
# ''Peace enforcement Missions'' are Chapter VII missions and unlike the previous Chapter VI missions, they do not require the consent of the belligerent parties. These are multidimensional operations comprising both civilian and military personnel. The military force is substantial in size and fairly well-equipped by UN Peacekeeping standards. They are mandated to use force for purposes beyond just self-defence. Examples include [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|ECOMOG]] and [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNAMSIL]] in [[West Africa]] and [[Sierra Leone]] in 1999, as well as the [[NATO]] operations in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]—[[Implementation Force|IFOR]] and [[SFOR]].&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 6–7"/&gt;

==== UN missions during and after the Cold War ====

During the [[Cold War]], peacekeeping was primarily interpositional in nature—thus being referred to as traditional peacekeeping. UN Peacekeepers were deployed in the aftermath of interstate conflict in order to serve as a buffer between belligerent factions and ensure compliance with the terms of an established peace agreement. Missions were consent-based, and more often than not observers were unarmed—such was the case with [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation|UNTSO]] in the [[Middle East]] and [[UN mediation of Kashmir|UNCIP]] in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. Others were armed—such as [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF-I]], established during the [[Suez Crisis]]. They were largely successful in this role.

In the [[Post–Cold War era|post-Cold War]] era, the United Nations has taken on a more nuanced, multidimensional approach to Peacekeeping. In 1992, in the aftermath of the Cold War, then [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] put together a report detailing his ambitious concepts for the United Nations and Peacekeeping at large. The report, titled ''[[An Agenda for Peace]]'', described a multi-faceted and interconnected set of measures he hoped would lead to effective use of the UN in its role in post-Cold War international politics. This included the use of preventative diplomacy, peace-enforcement, peace-making, peace-keeping and post-conflict reconstruction.

==== Broader aims of UN missions ====

In ''The UN Record on Peacekeeping Operations'', [[Michael W. Doyle|Michael Doyle]] and Nicolas Sambanis summarise Boutros Boutros’ report as preventative diplomacy, confidence-building measures such as fact-finding missions, observer mandates, and the potential deployment of UN mandated forces as a preventative measure in order to diminish the potential for violence or the danger of violence occurring and thus increasing the prospect for lasting peace. Their definitions are as follows:
# ''Peace-enforcement'', meant to act with or without the consent of the belligerents in order to ensure any treaty or cease-fire mandated by the United Nations Security Council is maintained. This is done primarily under the auspices of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and the forces are generally heavily armed as opposed to the unarmed, or lightly-armed personnel frequently deployed as observers.
# ''Peace-making'', meant to compel belligerents to seek a peaceful settlement for their differences via mediation and other forms of negotiation provided by the UN under the auspices of Chapter VI of the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]].
# ''Peace-keeping'', deployment of a lightly-armed United Nations presence in the field with the consent of the belligerents involved in order to build confidence and monitor any agreements between concerned parties. Additionally, diplomats would continue to work toward comprehensive and lasting peace, or for the implementation of an agreed upon peace.
# ''Post-Conflict Reconstruction,'' intended to develop economic and social cooperation meant to mend relations between the belligerents. Social, political, and economic infrastructure would ideally prevent potential violence and conflict in the future and help to contribute to a lasting and robust peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=Michael W.|last2=Sambanis|first2=Nicholas|date=2007|title=The UN Record On Peacekeeping Operations|url=|journal=International Journal|volume=63|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Union]] (AU) is working on building an African Peace and Security Architecture that fulfils the mandate to enforce peace and security on the continent. In cases of [[genocide]] or other serious human-rights violations, an AU-mission could be launched even against the wishes of the government of the country concerned, as long as it is approved by the AU General Assembly. The establishment of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) which includes the African Standby Force (ASF) is planned earliest for 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/african-peace-and-security-architecture-already-proving-useful-even-though-it-still-work |title=The African Peace and Security Architecture is already proving useful even though it is still work in progress |publisher=dandc.eu |date=27 August 2013 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unarmed Civilian Peacekeeping (UCP) are civilian personnel that carry out non-violent, non-interventionist and impartial set of tactics in order to protect civilians in conflict zones from violence in addition to supporting additional efforts to build a lasting peace. While the term UCP is not entirely ubiquitous among non-governmental agencies (NGOs) in the field: many utilize similar techniques and desire shared outcomes for peace; such as accompaniment, presence, rumour control, community security meetings, the securing of safe passage, and monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rachel|first=Julian|last2=Schweitzer|first2=Christine|date=2015|title=The Origins And Development of Unarmed Civilian Peacekeeping|url=|journal=Peace Review|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history==
{{Main|History of United Nations peacekeeping}}

===Creation and early years===

United Nations Peacekeeping started in 1948 when the [[United Nations Security Council]] authorised the deployment of UN unarmed military observers to the Middle East in order to monitor the armistice agreement that was signed between Israel and its Arab neighbours in the wake of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Arab-Israeli War]]. This operation was called the [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization]] (UNTSO) and is still in operation today.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/history.shtml|title=History of Peacekeeping|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the passage of resolution 73 (1949) by the Security Council in August 1949, UNTSO was given the task of fulfilling four Armistice Agreements between the state of Israel and the Arab states which had participated in the war. Thus, UNTSO's operations were spread through five states in the region—Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/untso/background.shtml|title=UNTSO Background|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War peacekeeping===
In the wake of independence in India and Pakistan in August 1947 and the subsequent bloodshed that followed the Security Council adopted resolution 39 (1948) in January 1948 in order to create the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), with the purpose of mediating the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir and the fighting related to it. This operation was non-interventionist in nature and was additionally tasked with supervision of a ceasefire signed by Pakistan and India in the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir|Jammu]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir|Kashmir]]. With the passage of the [[Karachi Agreement|Karachi agreement]] in July 1949, UNCIP would supervise a ceasefire line that would be mutually overseen by UN unarmed military observers and local commanders from each side in the dispute. UNCIP's mission in the region continues to this day, now under the operational title of the [[UN mediation of Kashmir|United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan]] (UNMOGIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unmogip/background.shtml|title=UNMOGIP Background|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, sixty-nine peacekeeping operations have been authorised and have deployed to various countries all over the world.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; The great majority of these operations have begun in the post-Cold War world. Between 1988 and 1998 thirty-five UN operations had been established and deployed. This signified a substantial increase when compared with the periods between 1948 and 1978; which saw the creation and deployment of only thirteen UN Peacekeeping operations and zero between 1978 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffey|first=Tamara|date=2000|title=Cultural Issues in Contemporary Peacekeeping|url=|journal=International Peacekeeping|volume=7|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed intervention first came in the form of UN involvement in the wake of the Suez Crisis in 1956. [[United Nations Emergency Force]] (UNEF-1), which existed from November 1956 to June 1967 was essentially the first ever United Nations peacekeeping force. It was given the mandate of ensuring the cessation of hostilities between [[Egypt]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Israel]] in addition to overseeing the withdrawal of French, Israeli and British troops from Egyptian territory. Upon completion of said withdrawal, UNEF would serve as a buffer force between Egyptian and Israeli forces in order to supervise conditions of the ceasefire and contribute to a lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unef1mandate.html|title=UNEF Mandate|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC), was deployed in 1960. This operation involved upwards of 20,000 military personnel at its peak, and resulted in the death of 250 UN personnel, including then Secretary-General [[Dag Hammarskjöld|Dag Hammarskjold]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/early.shtml|title=The Early Years of UN Peacekeeping|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ONUC was meant to ensure the withdrawal of [[Belgium|Belgian]] forces in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], who had reinserted themselves after Congolese independence in the wake of a revolt carried out by the [[Force Publique]] (FP), in order to protect Belgian citizens and economic interests. ONUC was also tasked with establishing and maintaining law and order (helping to end the FP revolt and ethnic violence) as well as provide technical assistance and training to Congolese security forces. An additional function was added to ONUC's mission, in which the force was tasked with maintaining the territorial integrity and political independence of the Congo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/onuc.htm|title=ONUC|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;—resulting from the secession of the mineral-rich provinces of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] and [[South Kasai]]. The UN forces there, somewhat controversially, more or less became an arm of the Congolese government at the time and helped to forcefully end the secession of both provinces.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the UN created multiple short-term missions all over the world including the Mission of the Representative of the Secretary-General in the Dominican Republic (DOMREP), the UN Security Force in West New Guinea (UNSF), the [[United Nations Yemen Observation Mission|UN Yemen Observation Mission]] (UNYOM), in conjunction with more long-term operations such as the [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus]] (UNFICYP), the UN Emergency Force II (UNEF II), the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|UN Interim Force]] in [[Lebanon]] (UNIFIL).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:UNpeacekeeping.svg|thumb|right|[[United Nations]] peacekeeping missions as of 2012]]

===Since 1991===
[[File:Evstafiev-bosnia-sarajevo-un-holds-head.jpg|thumb|[[Norway|Norwegian]] Peacekeeper during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], 1992 - 1993, photo by [[Mikhail Evstafiev]].]]Experiences of peacekeeping during the [[Yugoslav Wars]], especially failures such as the [[Srebrenica Massacre]], led, in part, to the [[United Nations Peacebuilding Commission]], which works to implement stable peace through some of the same civic functions that peacekeepers also work on, such as elections. The Commission currently works with six countries, all in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/africa/beyond-peace-deals-united-nations-experiment-peacebuilding |title=Beyond Peace Deals: The United Nations Experiment in "Peacebuilding"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[U.N. Security Council]] unanimously passed Resolution 2122, which among other things calls for stronger measures regarding women's participation in conflict and post-conflict processes such as peace talks, gender expertise in peacekeeping missions, improved information about the impact of armed conflict on women, and more direct briefing to the Council on progress in these areas.&lt;ref name="AWID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-Security-Council-Takes-a-Historic-Stand-Supporting-Abortion-Access-for-Women-Raped-in-War |title=UN Security Council Takes a Historic Stand Supporting Abortion Access for Women Raped in War / Library / Homepage |publisher=AWID |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203101025/http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-Security-Council-Takes-a-Historic-Stand-Supporting-Abortion-Access-for-Women-Raped-in-War |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013, the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), a UN women's rights committee, said in a general recommendation that states that have ratified the UN Women's Rights Convention are obliged to uphold women's rights before, during, and after conflict when they are directly involved in fighting, and/or are providing peacekeeping troops or donor assistance for conflict prevention, humanitarian aid or post-conflict reconstruction.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13885&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR -|website=www.ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Committee also stated that ratifying states should exercise due diligence in ensuring that [[non-state actor]]s, such as armed groups and private security contractors, be held accountable for crimes against women.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

One of the findings of Page Fortna about where peacekeepers go is that “peacekeeping is a matter of supply and demand” From the supply side, she observes that there is unlikely a Peacekeeping mission in civil wars on countries close to one of the members of the Security Council. From the demand side, there is diverse evidence that peacekeeping missions are deployed in the countries who need it the most, this is where the risk of a recurring war is high.&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 6–7" /&gt;

== Composition of peacekeeping forces ==

===Nations that participate in peacekeeping missions===
[[File:Irish troops UNMIL.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Irish [[UNMIL]] troops on patrol in Liberia, July 2006.]]
The [[United Nations Charter]] stipulates that to assist in maintaining peace and security around the world, all member states of the UN should make available to the Security Council necessary armed forces and facilities. Since 1948, about 130 nations have contributed military and civilian police personnel to peace operations. While detailed records of all personnel who have served in peacekeeping missions since 1948 are not available, it is estimated that up to one million soldiers, police officers and civilians have served under the UN flag in the last 56 years. As of March 2008, 113 countries were contributing a total 88,862 military observers, police, and troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/contributors/2008/mar08_1.pdf|title=Contributors to United Nations peacekeeping operations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the large number of contributors, the greatest burden continues to be borne by a core group of developing countries. The ten largest troop (including police and military experts) contributing countries to UN peacekeeping operations as of May, 2017 were [[Ethiopia]] (8229), [[India]] (7665), [[Pakistan]] (7135), [[Bangladesh]] (6958), [[Rwanda]] (6256), [[Nepal]] (5158), [[Burkina Faso]] (2969), [[Senegal]] (2847), [[Ghana]] (2751), [[Indonesia]] (2719).&lt;ref name="unpko-summary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/contributors.shtml|title=Troop and police contributors|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2008, in addition to military and police personnel, 5,187 international civilian personnel, 2,031 UN Volunteers, and 12,036 local civilian personnel worked in UN peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/bnote.htm|title=Background Note - United Nations Peacekeeping Operations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 30 June 2014, 3,243 people from over 100 countries have been killed while serving on peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/fatalities/documents/stats_2.pdf|title=United Nations peacekeeping - Fatalities By Year up to 30 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those came from [[India]] (157), [[Nigeria]] (142), [[Pakistan]] (136), [[Ghana]] (132), [[Canada]] (121), [[France]] (110) and the [[United Kingdom]] (103). Thirty percent of the fatalities in the first 55 years of UN peacekeeping occurred between 1993 and 1995.

[[Developing nations]] tend to participate in peacekeeping more than developed countries.  This may be due in part because forces from smaller countries avoid evoking thoughts of imperialism. The rate of reimbursement by the UN for troop contributing countries per peacekeeper per month include: $1,028 for pay and allowances; $303 supplementary pay for specialists; $68 for personal clothing, gear and equipment; and $5 for personal weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/faq/q10.htm|title=United Nations Peacekeepers - How are peacekeepers compensated?|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be a significant source of revenue for a developing country. By providing important training and equipment for the soldiers as well as salaries, UN peacekeeping missions allow them to maintain larger armies than they otherwise could. About 4.5% of the troops and civilian police deployed in UN peacekeeping missions come from the [[European Union]] and less than one percent from the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/overview.shtml |title=Peacekeeping Fact Sheet |publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's participation in peacekeeping===
Security Council Resolution 1325 was the first major step taken by the UN to include women as active and equal actors in “the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, peace-building, peacekeeping, humanitarian response and in post-conflict reconstruction and stresses the importance of their equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security”.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and the Advancement of Women (2013). "Landmark Resolution on Women Peace and Security", United Nations. http://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/wps/#resolution&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Security Council (October 31, 2000) "Resolution 1325", S/RES/1325, United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; A critique of this resolution is that UNSCR 1325 proposes the implementing gender mainstreaming, however the progress that has been accomplished in this area has focused on women, rather than on assessing the impacts of planned action on both men and women. In 2010, a comprehensive 10-year impact study was conducted to assess the success of this resolution and found that there was limited success with the implementation, particularly in the increasing women's participation in peace negotiations and peace agreements, and sexual and gender-based violence has continued to be prevalent, despite efforts to reduce it.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department of Field Support (2010). "Ten-year Impact Study on Implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) on Women, Peace and Security in Peacekeeping", United Nations, p. 9-10. https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/documents/10year_impact_study_1325.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ghana IntPeaceCorps 2016-05-29 B002a.jpg|thumb|Ghanaian women serve in UN Peacekeeping]]
In 2013 the [[U.N. Security Council]] unanimously passed Resolution 2122, which among other things calls for stronger measures regarding women's participation in conflict and post-conflict processes such as peace talks, gender expertise in peacekeeping missions, improved information about the impact of armed conflict on women, and more direct briefing to the Council on progress in these areas.&lt;ref name="AWID"/&gt; Also in 2013, the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), a UN women's rights committee, said in a general recommendation that states that have ratified the UN Women's Rights Convention are obliged to uphold women's rights before, during, and after conflict when they are directly involved in fighting, and/or are providing peacekeeping troops or donor assistance for conflict prevention, humanitarian aid or post-conflict reconstruction &lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt; The Committee also stated that ratifying states should exercise due diligence in ensuring that non-state actors, such as armed groups and private security contractors, be held accountable for crimes against women.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

As of July 2016, women serve in every UN peacekeeping mission either as troops, police, or civilian staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/gender.shtml|title=Gender statistics. United Nations Peacekeeping|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993, women made up 1% of deployed uniformed personnel. In 2014, out of approximately 125,000 peacekeepers, women constitute 3% of military personnel and 10% of police personnel in UN Peacekeeping missions, as well as 29% of international and 17% of national staff in peacekeeping and special political missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/issues/women/womeninpk.shtml|title=Women in Peacekeeping.

== Theoretical basis for why peacekeeping missions should keep and preserve peace ==
While much has been written about Peacekeeping and what Peacekeepers do, very little empirical research has taken place in order to identify the manner in which Peacekeepers can have an impact in a post-conflict environment. [[Columbia University]] Professor, Virginia Page Fortna attempts to lay out four causal mechanisms through which peacekeepers have the opportunity to lay the groundwork for a lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' Choices After Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia Page|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortna's four mechanisms are as follows:
# Change the incentives of recent belligerents, making peace more desirable or war more costly.
# Reduce the uncertainty and fear that drives security dilemma spirals.
# Prevent or control accidents or the actions of rogue groups that might otherwise escalate back to war.
# Prevent political abuse by one side (generally the government) that might cause actors losing the peace to take up arms anew.
Fortna argues that peacekeepers have a positive impact on the peace process, despite often being sent to places where peace is most difficult to achieve. Peacekeeping is often looked at by detractors as ineffective, or unnecessary. Peace prevails when belligerents already have a vested interest in sustaining peace and therefore it could be argued that Peacekeepers play only a minor role in creating a strong foundation for enduring peace. Yet these causal reasons illustrate the important roles that Peacekeepers play in ensuring that peace lasts, especially when contrasted against situations in which belligerents are left to their own devices. These causal reasons thus illustrate the need for Peacekeeping and lay a foundation for the manner in which Peacekeeping operations can have a substantive impact on the post-conflict environment.

In order to change the incentives for war and make peace more appealing the UN can provide a military force by way of an enforcement mandate which provides deterrence to would-be spoilers. They can monitor the situation making the potential for surprise attack by one of the belligerents less likely to occur or by making it more difficult to carry out such an attack. A lightly-armed observer mission can also serve as an early-warning force or “tripwire” for the aforementioned enforcement mission. Aid and recognition provided to the belligerents by the international community should be made conditional and based on compliance with objectives laid out in the negotiating process. And lastly, peace dividends should be provided in the forms of jobs, public works and other benefits.

To reduce uncertainty and fear the UN Peacekeeping force can monitor the aforementioned compliance, facilitate communication between belligerents in order to ease security dilemma concerns thus reassuring belligerents that the other side will not renege, and allow for belligerents to signal their legitimate intentions for peace to the other side. That is to say, provide a meaningful pathway for communication between both sides to make their intentions known and credible.

Prevention and control of potential accidents that may derail the peace process can be achieved by the peacekeeping force by deterring rogue groups. Belligerent forces are often undisciplined without a strong central source of [[command and control]], therefore while a peace is being negotiated there is potential for a rogue group on one side to renege and spoil the peace process. UN forces can serve to prevent this. Additionally, the UN force can serve as a moderator and make communication easy between both parties and bring in political moderates from either side. By providing law and order UN peacekeeping forces can temporarily replace a state's security forces and prevent a bias overreaction to an alleged violation by one side which could in turn result in escalation and a renewal in the violence.

Prevention of political abuse can be achieved through the reformation of institutions associated with the government. Training and monitoring the security forces (e.g. army or police) help to make them an unbiased protector of the people rather than a weapon of suppression for the ruling government. Hopefully this training can bring trust by the people for the security establishment. UN forces can also run and monitor elections in order to ensure a fair process. In other cases, the UN may provide a neutral interim government to administer the country during a transitional period wherein the associated government institutions are being retrained, reformed or better developed. Lastly, military groups such as armed rebels can be encouraged to put down their weapons and transformed into political organisations using appropriate non-violent means to mete out their grievances and compete in the election cycle. This is especially important as many of these groups serve as the chief opposition to a given government, but lack the means or know-how to operate effectively as political organisations.

Different peacekeeping missions take place as a result of different causal mechanisms. More military deterrence and enforcement are meant for those missions operating under the auspices of Chapter VII, while Chapter VI missions are meant to serve more as monitoring forces and interpositional operations are meant to target and prevent potential political abuse—these are primarily multidimensional missions and are heavily involved in the post-conflict political situation.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work?: Shaping Belligerents' Choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia Page|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2014 survey of the academic literature, "there is considerable evidence that [United Nations peacekeeping operations] are effective in maintaining peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoeffler|first=Anke|date=2014-03-11|title=Can international interventions secure the peace?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2233865914525380|journal=[[International Area Studies Review]]|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=75–94|doi=10.1177/2233865914525380}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fortna, there is strong evidence that the presence of peacekeepers significantly reduces the risk of renewed warfare; more peacekeeping troops contribute to fewer battlefield deaths; and more peacekeeping troops contribute to fewer civilian deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2015/09/24/enough-with-the-pessimism-about-peacekeeping/|title=Enough with the Pessimism about Peacekeeping|date=2015-09-24|website=Political Violence at a Glance|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by political scientists at [[Uppsala University]] and [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]] estimates that an ambitious UN peacekeeping policy with a doubled peacekeeping operation and strong mandates would "reduce the global incidence of armed conflict by two thirds relative to a no-PKO scenario."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hegre|first=Håvard|last2=Hultman|first2=Lisa|last3=Nygård|first3=Håvard Mokleiv|date=2018-11-28|title=Evaluating the Conflict-Reducing Effect of UN Peacekeeping Operations|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/700203|journal=The Journal of Politics|language=en|pages=000–000|doi=10.1086/700203|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fordham University political scientist Anjali Dayal, "Scholars have found that peacekeeping keeps wars from bleeding across borders. Having more peacekeepers on the ground also seems to correspond with fewer civilians targeted with violence. And peace operations at times have successfully served as transitional authorities, handing power back to local authorities, although this is decreasingly true."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/01/is-u-n-peacekeeping-under-fire-heres-what-you-need-to-know/|title=Is U.N. peacekeeping under fire? Here’s what you need to know.|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that the promise to deploy peacekeepers can help international organizations bring combatants to the negotiation table and increase the likelihood that they will agree to a cease-fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|year=2016|title=Which international organizations can settle civil wars?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-016-9253-0|journal=Review of International Organizations|volume=DOI 10.1007/s11558-016-9253-0|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By controlling for specific factors that affect where peacekeepers are deployed and what the potential chances for peace are, Page Fortna's statistical research shows that there is a statistically significant impact on lasting peace when peacekeepers are deployed. Despite the fact that peacekeepers are sent to locations where peace is least likely to succeed, Fortna finds that conservative estimates suggest that the presence of UN peacekeepers diminishes the risk for renewed violence by at least 55%-60%; with less conservatives estimates upwards of 75%-85%.&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 116"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' Choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, her analysis concludes that there is little difference in the effectiveness between Chapter VI consent-based missions and Chapter VII enforcement missions. Indeed, enforcement missions only remain effective if the UN peacekeeping force can prove and sustain their credibility in the use of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' Choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=109, 116, 125}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stresses the importance of a UN mission maintaining the consent of the peacekept. Ultimately, Fortna finds that peacekeeping is an effective tool for ensuring a lasting peace; especially compared to situations in which belligerents' are left to their own devices. Utilising the previously mentioned causal mechanisms for peacekeeping, a UN peacekeeping force can have a substantial and substantive impact on sustaining a lasting peace. Having a relative consensus of the positive impact of peacekeeping for ensuring a lasting peace, Fortna and Howard suggest that  the literature is moving towards the study of  i) the effectiveness of the types of peace-keepers, ii) the transitional administrations, iii) the links between peacekeeping and democratisation, and iv) the perspectives of the “peacekept".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.041205.103022|title=Pitfalls and Prospects in the Peacekeeping Literature*|last=Fortna|first=Virginia Page|last2=Howard|first2=Lise Morjé|date=2008-05-20|website=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.041205.103022|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.041205.103022|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doyle and Sambanis' analysis finds that lasting peace is more likely after non-ethnic wars in countries with a relatively high level of development in addition to whether or not UN peacekeeping forces and financial assistance are available. They conclude that in the short run lasting peace is more dependent on a robust UN deployment coupled with low levels of hostility between belligerents. They note that increased economic capacity can provide an incentive not to renew hostilities. In the long run, however, economic capacity matters far more whereas the degree of hostility between belligerents is less important. As successful as UN deployments can be, they have inadequately spurred independent economic development within the countries where they have intervened. Thus, the UN plays a strong, but indirect role and success in lasting peace is predicated on the development of institutions that support peace, rather than serving as a deterrent for renewed war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making War and Building Peace : United Nations Peace Operations|last=Doyle|first=Michael W.|last2=Sambanis|first2=Nicholas|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=336–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholarly analyses show varying success rates for peacekeeping missions, with estimate ranging from 31 percent to 85 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Autesserre|first1=Severine|title=Peaceland: Conflict Resolution and the Everyday Politics of International Intervention|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors that Impact Lasting Peace ===
There are many factors that can have a negative impact on lasting peace such as hidden information about the relative strength possessed by the belligerents; a rebel group's involvement in illicit financing through means such as through the export of diamonds and other minerals; participation in the trafficking of drugs, weapons and human beings; whether or not military victory was achieved by one side; the length of the war as well as how costly it was; commitment problems and security dilemma spirals experienced by both sides; whether a cease-fire or treaty signed by the belligerents; lack of transparency in the motives and actions carried out by belligerents in the immediate aftermath of the conflict; extremist spoilers; participants in the conflict that may benefit from its continuation; indivisibility and more.

Perhaps one of the most statistically significant contributors to a lasting peace is whether or not military victory was achieved by one side. According to Fortna's research, civil wars in which one side wins, resulting in a cease-fire or truce, have an approximately 85%-90% lower chance of renewed war. Moreover, peace treaties further reduce the risk by 60%-70%.&lt;ref name="Fortna 2008 116"/&gt;

If a group is funded by drugs, diamonds or other illicit trade then there is a substantial increase in the chance of renewed violence—100%-250%-- which is to say that in such circumstances war is two to three-and-a-half times more likely to begin again.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' Choice after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Fortna finds that wars which involve many factions are less likely to resume,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Doyle and Sambanis find the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making War and Building Peace : United Nations Peace Operations|last=Doyle|first=Michael W.|last2=Sambanis|first2=Nicholas|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costly wars and wars fought along identity lines both provide varied chances of the renewal of violence. While longer wars and peace established by treaty (especially those attained by military victory) can reduce the chances of another war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work?

== Impacts of peacekeeping on participating forces ==

===Military normalisation===
Some commentators have highlighted the potential to leverage peacekeeping operations as a mechanism for advancing military normalisation. Michael Edward Walsh and Jeremy Taylor have argued that [[Japan]]'s peacekeeping operations in [[South Sudan]] provide those promoting Japan's military normalisation with "a unique opportunity to further erode the country’s pacifist constitution."&lt;ref name="nbr.org"&gt;Jeremy Taylor and Michael Edward Walsh (7 January 2014), ''[http://www.nbr.org/downloads/pdfs/psa/taylor-walsh_commentary_010714.pdf UN Operations in Africa Provide a Mechanism for Japan’s Military Normalization Agenda]'', retrieved 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; "Unable to accept the full weight of modern peacekeeping operations without fundamental political, legal, and social changes," they conclude that "Japan’s peacekeepers remain ill-prepared to tackle many serious contingencies requiring use of deadly force."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Edward Walsh and Jeremy Taylor (23 December 2013), ''[http://africanarguments.org/2013/12/23/time-to-reconsider-the-japanese-peacekeeping-mission-in-south-sudan-by-michael-edward-walsh-jeremy-taylor/ Time to Reconsider the Japanese Peacekeeping Mission in South Sudan]'', retrieved 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, they suggest that Japan's continued participation in UN peacekeeping operations might force policy changes that ultimately push the country toward "a tipping point from which the normalisation of Japan’s military (will be) the only outcome."&lt;ref name="nbr.org"/&gt;

===Political impact on sending countries===
[[Diana Muir|Diana Muir Appelbaum]], has expressed concern that the creation of a military in [[Fiji]] for the purpose of serving in international peacekeeping missions, has produced a military powerful enough to stage four coups d’état (1987, 1999–2000, 2006, and 2009) and to rule Fiji as a military dictatorship for over two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Diana Muir (27 August 2012), ''[http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/4867/features/how-the-sinai-peacekeeping-force-staged-a-military-coup-in-fiji/ How the Sinai Peacekeeping Force Staged a Military Coup in Fiji]'', retrieved 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2018 study published in the Journal of Peace Research, found that countries where militaries are highly dependent on the funds they receive from UN peacekeeping were less likely to experience coups d’états than comparable countries less dependent on such funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|date=2018|title=Backdoor peacekeeping: Does participation in UN peacekeeping reduce coups at home?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343317747668|journal=Journal of Peace Research|doi=10.1177/0022343317747668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impacts on individual peacekeepers ===

Studies of peacekeeping soldiers show both positive and negative effects. A study of 951 US Army soldiers assigned to Bosnia revealed that 77% reported some positive consequences, 63% reported a negative consequence, and 47% reported both.&lt;ref&gt;Newby, John H., et al. "Positive and negative consequences of a military deployment." ''Military Medicine'' (2005) 170#10 pp: 815-819&lt;/ref&gt;  The peacekeepers are exposed to danger caused by the warring parties and often in an unfamiliar climate. This gives rise to different mental health problems, suicide, and substance abuse as shown by the percentage of former peacekeepers with those problems. Having a parent in a mission abroad for an extended period is also stressful to the peacekeepers' families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fernandes Souza | first1 = Wanderson | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Posttraumatic stress disorder in peacekeepers: a meta-analysis | url = | journal = The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 199 | issue = 5| pages = 309–312 | doi=10.1097/nmd.0b013e3182175180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another viewpoint raises the problem that the peacekeeping may soften the troops and erode their combat ability, as the mission profile of a peacekeeping contingent is totally different from the profile of a unit fighting an all-out war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926001502/http://www.usafa.af.mil/jscope/ISME2007/Papers/Prof%20Paulin%20Kaurin%20War%20Stories.doc Kaurin, P.

==Criticism==

===Peacekeeping, human trafficking, and forced prostitution===
{{Main|Peacekeeping child sexual abuse scandal}}
Since the 1990s, UN Peacekeepers have been the subject of numerous accusations of abuse ranging from [[rape]] and [[sexual assault]], to [[pedophilia]] and [[human trafficking]]. Complaints have arisen from [[Cambodia]], [[East Timor]] and [[West Africa]]. In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] prostitution associated with trafficked women skyrocketed and often operated just beyond the gates of U.N. compounds. David Lamb, a regional human rights officer in Bosnia from 2000 to 2001 claimed “The sex slave trade in Bosnia largely exists because of the U.N. peacekeeping operation. Without the peacekeeping presence, there would have been little or no forced prostitution in Bosnia.” In addition, hearing held by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 2002 found that members of SFOR were frequenting Bosnian brothels and engaging in sex with trafficked women and underage girls.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allred|first=KJ|date=2006|title=Peacekeepers And Prostitutes: How Deployed Forces Fuel the Demand for Trafficked Women and New Hope for Stopping It|url=|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|volume=33|issue=1|page=7|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporters witnessed a rapid increase in prostitution in [[Cambodia]], [[Mozambique]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], and [[Kosovo]] after UN and, in the case of the latter two, NATO peacekeeping forces moved in. In the 1996 UN study called "The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children", former first lady of Mozambique [[Graça Machel]] documented: "In 6 out of 12 country studies on sexual exploitation of children in situations of armed conflict prepared for the present report, the arrival of peacekeeping troops has been associated with a rapid rise in [[child prostitution]]".&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/graca/a51-306_en.pdf|title=The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gita Sahgal]] spoke out in 2004 with regard to the fact that prostitution and [[sex abuse]] crops up wherever [[humanitarian intervention]] efforts are set up. She observed that the "issue with the UN is that [[peacekeeping operation]]s unfortunately seem to be doing the same thing that other militaries do. Even the guardians have to be guarded".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1126/p06s02-wogi.html Sex charges haunt UN forces; In places like Congo and Kosovo, peacekeepers have been accused of abusing the people they're protecting," ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', 26 November 2004, accessed 16 February 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein]], then Permanent Representative of [[Jordan]] to the United Nations, in 2006 resulted in a comprehensive report which detailed some of this abuse in detail— particularly that which occurred in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Sexual exploitation frequently came in the form of prostitution, wherein some money (an average of $1-$3 per encounter) was exchanged for sex. In other instances food, or jobs were utilized to ply women for sex. Other young women reported of “rape disguised as prostitution”, whereabouts Peacekeepers would rape them and were then given some money or food in order to make the act seem consensual.&lt;ref&gt;al-Hussein, Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid. (2005) "A Comprehensive Strategy to Eliminate Future Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in United Nations Peacekeeping Operations." Report to the UN Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations: 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Between May and September 2004, there were seventy-two allegations of sexual exploitation—68 against military and 4 against civilian personnel. By the end of 2004 there would be a total of 105 allegations. The majority of these allegations were in regards to sex with person under the age of 18 years (45 percent) and sex with adult prostitutes (31 percent). Rape and sexual assault made up approximately 13 and 5 percent respectively, with the remaining 6 percent of allegations relating to other forms of sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;al-Hussein, Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid. (2005) "A Comprehensive Strategy to Eliminate Future Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in United Nations Peacekeeping Operations." Report to the UN Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations: 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the allegations were against peacekeepers from [[Pakistan]], [[Uruguay]], [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

[[Uruguay]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;an President [[Jose Mujica]] apologized to Haitian President [[Michel Martelly]] over the alleged rape of an 18-year-old Haitian man by Uruguayan UN peacekeeping troops. Martelly said "a collective rape carried out against a young Haitian" would not go unpunished. Four soldiers suspected of being involved in the rape have been detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/07/us-haiti-uruguay-un-idUSTRE78603I20110907|title=Uruguay apologises over alleged rape by U.N. peacekeepers|work=Reuters|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=236953|title=Uruguay to apologise over alleged rape by UN peacekeepers|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007 the United Nations [[Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] (DPKO) confined an entire contingent of 734 Moroccans in the [[Ivory Coast]] in the wake of allegations that some had sexually abused underage girls. In the following years, there were 80 investigations carried out by the UN [[United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services|Office of Internal Oversight Services]] (OIOS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simic|first=Olivera|date=2012|title=UN Peacekeeping Operations: The Emerging Problem Of Sexual Exploitation|url=|journal=Regulation of Sexual Conduct in UN Peacekeeping Operations|pages=13–38|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, allegations were levelled on personnel from [[France]], [[Gabon]], and [[Burundi]] operating in the [[Central African Republic]]. These include accusations of sexual abuse and exploitation of at least 108 from [[Kémo|Kemo Prefecture]] and that the vast majority of the cases involved minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/world/africa/un-peacekeeping-hit-by-new-allegations-of-sickening-sex-abuse.html?_r=0|title=U.N.

[[Tanzania]] and the UN opened a joint inquiry into the alleged abuse, which involved Tanzanian troops. There have been 18 reports of sexual abuse, eight of which involved minors. Sixteen Tanzanian soldiers, a [[Malawi]]an and a South African are implicated in the accusations. The UN reported in March 2016 that there was a large increase in allegations; which involved troops from twenty one countries. Most of the allegations involved troops from African countries including: [[Cameroon]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Tanzania]], [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Burundi]], [[Ghana]], [[Madagascar]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Rwanda]], [[Senegal]] and [[Togo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/probe-opens-un-troops-alleged-sex-abuse-dr-155023758.html|title=Probe Opens into UN Troops' Alleged Sex Abuse in DR Congo|last=|first=|date=2016|work=|access-date=17 April 2016|via=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cholera]] is a waterborne disease that causes diarrhoea and vomiting, and it can kill in a matter of hours if patients do not receive rehydration intervention. As of July 2012, Haiti's cholera epidemic was the worst in the world:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/haiti_cholera.htm Haiti Cholera: One Year Later, [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] 25 October 2011, accessed 30 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; about 7,500 had died and about 585,000 Haitians (about 1 in every 20 Haitians) had become ill with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mspp.gouv.ht/site/downloads/Rapport%20journalier%20MSPP%20du%2022%20juillet%202012.pdf|title=Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population Cholera Report of July 22, 2012, 22 July 2011, accessed 30 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN-appointed Independent Panel of Experts on the Cholera Outbreak in Haiti, the conditions at the Peacekeeping base were unsafe, and allowed contamination of Haiti's river systems in at least two ways: "The construction of the water pipes in the main toilet/showering area [was] haphazard, with significant potential for cross-contamination...especially from pipes that run over an open drainage ditch that runs throughout the camp and flows directly into the Meye Tributary System".&lt;ref name="UNCholeraReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/haiti/UN-cholera-report-final.pdf|title=Final Report of the Independent Panel of Experts on the Cholera Outbreak in Haiti, pages 21-22, July 2011, accessed 30 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Independent Panel reported that on a regular basis black water waste from the Mirebalais base and two other bases was deposited in an open, unfenced septic pit that was susceptible to flooding and would overflow into the Meye Tributary during rainfall.&lt;ref name="UNCholeraReport" /&gt;

In November 2011, over 5,000 victims of the cholera epidemic filed a claim with the UN's internal claims mechanism seeking redress in the form of clean water and sanitation infrastructure necessary to control the epidemic, compensation for individual losses, and an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-15648110|title=Haiti cholera demand against UN|date=9 November 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, 104 Members of the [[U.S. Congress|United States Congress]] signed a letter affirming that the "actions of the UN" had brought cholera to Haiti and that the UN should "confront and ultimately eliminate cholera".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18928405|title=Haiti cholera 'UN responsibility'|first=Mark|last=Doyle|date=20 July 2012|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the UN rejected the claim and the victims' lawyers have pledged to sue the UN in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijdh.org/cholera-litigation/ |title=Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti: Cholera Litigation |publisher=Ijdh.org |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural Concerns Related to Contemporary Peacekeeping ===
There is a notable intermingling of varied cultures when it comes to peacekeeping. From the vast number of troops, police and personnel that are brought together from various contributing countries to the oftentimes challenging ethnic regions which peacekeeping forces are often deployed. Because of these varied cultures, complicated cultural interactions take place which not only affect mission effectiveness, but can also lead to friction with the population the peacekeepers are meant to be assisting.

In most cases prior to 1988, specific countries often provided peacekeepers. At that point, only twenty six countries had sent personnel to participate in peacekeeping deployments. Today, that number has risen to more than eighty.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffey|first=Tamara|date=2000|title=Cultural Issues in Contemporary Peacekeeping|url=|journal=International Peacekeeping|volume=7|issue=1|pages=146–147|doi=10.1080/13533310008413823|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in an extremely heterogeneous group. Thus, UN Peacekeeping deployments must not only contend with language complications, but also myriad cultural and social differences that can create operational difficulties that are hard to overcome. These difference can create problems with regard to interactions (whether personal or between institutions/units), misunderstandings, inadvertent offensive behaviour and prejudices that may be associated with a particular contingent from a given country.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

In terms of operations, effectiveness can be hindered by the varying tactics, techniques and procedures employed by the military or police personnel that are a part of a given deployment. Because UN forces are cobbled together from so many different sources, there is a discrepancy in capabilities, training, equipment, standards and procedures. Moreover, substantial differences exist in the form of command and control between contributing members personnel. In addition, some nations may not wish to be subordinated to another, complicating [[unity of command]]. This can lead to deep-seated divisions between contingents  within the UN force that results in a lack of mutual support between units in the field. This can be demonstrated in the experiences of UN peacekeeping forces deployed to [[East Timor]], where the [[Australia]]ns engaged in a robust operation that maximised force protection in contrast to a pro-active heart and minds approach utilised by Great Britain's [[Gurkha|Ghurka]] personnel.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Maintaining the consent of the peacekept is an important facet of modern peacekeeping. Notably in Bosnia, [[Somalia]] and Rwanda, fundamental principles of retaining that consent was ignored on the grounds of a humanitarian intervention—reflecting the nature of an Article VII intervention. Yet in order to stress and maintain the legitimacy of an intervention it is important that the UN's forces continue to enjoy the consent of the population and government of the country to which they were deployed. This means making the peacekept feel a part of the process in addition to important cultural knowledge of the area in which peacekeepers are operating, in order to reduce friction and provide for a successful operation.

There has been little study on the interaction of cultures that exist within a peacekeeping force and the population within which they operate. However, in 1976 Galtun and Hveem studied [[Norway|Norwegian]] personnel who participated in UNEF-1 (in Gaza) and ONUC (Congo). They posited that knowledge of the culture and an understanding of the inhabitants in a given country were not only necessary, but crucial for the success of the mission. They found that personnel from the Norwegian contingent wanted greater insight into the conflict and the culture in which they operated. They also wanted more robust training with regard to working with people from other countries. Yet the study revealed the troops received very little from briefings and that the majority of the information regarding the conflict was gained through the news, reading books or speaking with other UN personnel—rather than any established UN training program.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duffey|first=Tamara|date=2000|title=Cultural Issues in Contemporary Peacekeeping|url=|journal=International Peacekeeping|volume=7|issue=1|pages=150–151|doi=10.1080/13533310008413823|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a study conducted on the relations between members of UNIFIL and local population in Lebanon, carried out by Heiberg and Holst, all but confirmed the findings. In their example, they found that the countries that were able to integrate more fully with the population and show a depth of knowledge about the local culture were more successful, while those that were ambitious, but less integrated into the local scene found themselves far removed from the individuals with which they were supposed to be engaged with, and their success, or lack thereof, illustrated this.&lt;blockquote&gt;Only the Italian contingent of some 2,200 people operated as part of the local environment and became an active element in restoring normal living conditions. Its soldiers were provided with the training required to acquaint them with the cultural, political and social situation of the people among whom they worked. Operating in a sector that contained approximately 600,000 inhabitants, mostly Shi'ites, the Italians carefully nurtured contact with the ordinary citizens and the political leaders in their area... While the Americans thought they were becoming involved in Lebanese politics, they entered into Lebanese culture and history with little or no understanding of the way things worked-- or didn't work... Most Americans did not understand the subtleties of short-term alliances, the length of memories and blood feuds, the strength of ''aln'' [kin] in Arab culture nor the nuances of religious differences.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This illustrates the importance of understanding the significance that culture plays in the conduct of successful peacekeeping operations. However, despite the existence of a UN training manual that attempts to advise peacekeepers on necessary techniques, there is no unifying doctrine, or standardised procedure among peacekeeping contingents, which will ultimately hinder the potential for success.

=== Limitations on Contemporary Intervention and Conflict Resolution ===
Throughout the duration of the Cold War external intervention and mediation in civil conflicts took on a state-centric mechanism in which sovereignty was inviolable. Rarely did the international community intervene in internal conflicts involving a state's government and domestic belligerents that opposed it. Since the end of the Cold War, however, that has changed. Today, mediation by international actors in civil conflict rest on a standardised resolution mechanism that accords broadly equal standing to all factions within a conflict, and attempts to reach a settlement accepted by all.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clapham|first=Christopher|date=1998|title=Rwanda: The Perils of Peace|url=|journal=Journal of Peace Research|publisher=|volume=35|issue=2|pages=193–210|doi=10.1177/0022343398035002003|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Cold War presented an opportunity to reshape the international system. This opportunity was afforded to the Cold War's victor's-- that is to say—the [[United States]] and other western capitalist states governed by liberal-democratic values that put a premium on [[Human rights|basic human rights]] and [[democratization]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the preceding decades the state was the only entity to receive special status. While there were exceptions, such as groups struggling against colonial powers, the state possessed the ultimate degree of legitimacy. As a result, the international community rarely meddled with the internal machinations of a given country. Sovereignty was not to be violated and this was a system which benefited both superpowers, their allies, as well as [[Third World|third world]] governments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Now, however, with legitimacy being extended to non-state actors, as well as the opportunity for a minority to secede from a given state and form a new country there has been a dramatic shift in the international status quo. Moreover, the international community's model for conflict resolution is heavily influenced by academic thought developed in western countries. This model encourages intervening in civil wars in order to stop political violence and come to a negotiated settlement which often involves democratising efforts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Critics such as Christopher Clapham and [[David Shearer]], argue that this intervention can provide mechanisms for continued conflict to the detriment of the civilian population. Clapham's argument is principally in relation to the situation in [[Rwanda]] leading up to the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; whereas Shearer focuses on the negative aspects of intervention, primarily regarding [[Sierra Leone]], which prevents total victory by one side and results in the creation of asymmetries between belligerents which opens the door for continued bloodshed.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shearer|first=David|date=1997|title=Exploring the Limits of Consent: Conflict Resolution in Sierra Leone|url=|journal=Millennium- Journal of International Studies|volume=26|issue=3|pages=845–860|doi=10.1177/03058298970260030601|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rwanda, third-party attempts at a negotiated settlement between the [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] afforded an opportunity for Hutu extremists to prepare for the killing of Hutu moderates and the genocide of the Tutsi. The international community, led by regional states from the [[Organisation of African Unity]], sought to negotiate a settlement and find a solution for the ongoing ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi via the Arusha Peace Process. This process lasted just over a year, included substantial international involvement, and incorporated many regional actors such as [[Tanzania]] (host of the process), [[Burundi]], [[Uganda]] and [[Zaire]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

While the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) was a major beneficiary of the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha accords]] and was able to redress many of its grievances, many of the gains that it made could have been achieved through military action. Arusha, according to Clapham, affected the relative power of the participants in the two following ways: a ceasefire which froze the distribution of territorial control at a particular point and secondly the importance it ascribed to the participants of the negotiations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Meaning that it froze the conflict and prevented continued territorial gains being made by the RPF, in addition to designating the degree of importance with regard to the factions within the negotiations. A faction's importance was weighted not on their relative popularity or military strength, but on artificial weight assigned by the mediators. Thus, the entire process served to undermine the RPF's position while stalling their hitherto successful military campaign, while allowing Hutu extremists to prepare for a genocide.

Shearer argues that modern strategies that rely solely on consent-based negotiations are severely limited and that victory by military means should not be ignored. He states that a shift in battlefield fortunes can often bring one belligerent to the negotiation table and will likewise moderate their demands.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Consent is of great importance when it comes to negotiation and mediation. The current international system and the conflict resolution model which the international community has utilised most since the end of the Cold War puts a premium on consent. But Shearer asks that if a belligerent uses negotiations and cease-fires as a method of delay in order to allow them to reposition military forces and continue fighting, then should consent-based strategies still be pursued, regardless of the potential for lengthening a conflict and the associated human cost?&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to the empirical analysis cited by Shearer, past civil wars with negotiated settlements have had little success. He cites a study from John Stedman that notes between 1900 and 1980 85% of civil wars were solved by one side winning outright (this excludes colonial wars). 15% percent ended as a result of negotiation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, Roy Licklider's study supports these conclusions by noting the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;"From 1945 to 1989, 58 out of a total of 93 civil conflicts, as he categorised them, were settled in some form, while the remainder continued. However, only 14 (or 24 percent) of those settled were solved by negotiation. The others (76 percent) ended with military victories. Additionally, fighting resumed in seven of the 14 conflict which were initially ended by negotiation. The overall success rate of negotiated settlements, therefore, was around 12 percent out of the internal wars that ended."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Sierra Leone the [[Revolutionary United Front]], led by [[Foday Sankoh]], fought an ongoing and bloody civil war with the government from 1991 to 1996. The conflict attracted little international attention, but managed to devastate the country and destroy its economy. Neither belligerent was willing to concede or compromise on their demands, despite multiple attempts at a negotiated settlement. It was not until the intervention of the [[Private military company|private military corporation]] [[Executive Outcomes]] and a reversal in the RUF's battlefield fortunes that Sankoh would come to the table.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In the aftermath the RUF was a depleted threat, civilians were able to return from refugee camps and begin rebuilding their lives. But the peace was fragile and negotiations were ongoing. The RUF was reluctant to put down their arms, concerned over potential retribution at the hands of army units and civilian militias alike. There was a planned deployment of UN peacekeepers meant to ease these concerns and help with the transition to peace, but things began to unravel. International contributors began to shy away from further peacekeeping initiatives; such as an expensive and open-ended mission in a strategically unimportant country. As a result, the UN's intervention force was slow to come to fruition and then came to a halt completely when Sankoh argued the size of the contingent of 740 UN peacekeepers was too large.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The UN refused to engage without total consent from both parties, thus preventing the deployment of a peacekeeping force. This consent-based approach, Shearer argues, illustrates the limits the UN can play in the volatile and fragile state of affairs that exist during and after civil wars. "In Sierra Leone, it meant that an important component needed to shore up the peace-building process was absent. It also meant that Sankoh was dictating terms."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This consent-based approach effectively allowed the leadership of a brutal rebel group to hinder the potential for peace.

The situation was exacerbated by the fact that the newly elected [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah|President]] of Sierra Leone terminated the Executive Outcomes contract undermining his [[hard power]] advantage. Things were further inflamed when disaffected officers of the [[Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces|army]] overthrew the government in 1997.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The war quickly renewed. A small UN force of monitors was deployed to observe the security situation. [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNOMSIL]], as it was called, was deployed between July 1998 and October 1999, but was forced to withdraw from the country when the RUF took the country's [[Freetown|capitol]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Peacekeeping Work? Shaping Belligerents' choices after Civil War|last=Fortna|first=Virginia|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNAMSIL]] was eventually formed and deployed in 1999, authorised under a Chapter VII mandate, it was meant to enforce the Lome agreements. However, violence would continue. From the outset the RUF was beyond uncooperative and once the [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|ECOMOG]] contingent withdrew, the RUF attacked UN forces, eventually taking hundreds hostage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This led to an unexpected backlash from the international community that the RUF did not anticipate. Its leadership had expected the international community to cut and run, as it had done in Somalia and earlier when UNOMSIL fled Freetown. Instead, with British support, an aggressive [[British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War|campaign]] was waged against the RUF. UNAMSIL's mandate was expanded and its manpower enlarged. By late 2000 and early 2001 the RUF's military strength had been severely depleted. Thus the [[Abuja Agreement (disambiguation)|Abuja agreements]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; were signed and UNAMSIL fulfilled its mandate in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unamsil/|title=UNAMSIL: United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Sierra Leone is at peace today and the UN's mission can be deemed a success, the way in which the situation developed illustrates Shearer's point: that a consent-based approach focused on negotiation that encompasses all belligerents' interest may not necessarily lead to success. As we see, fighting continued despite the presence of UNOMSIL. Indeed, even after UNOMSIL was replaced by a more robust force under a Chapter VII mandate in the form of UNAMSIL the violence continued. It was not until the British intervened militarily and substantially degraded the RUF's capability to sustain the conflict, as Executive Outcomes had done years prior, did the RUF finally come to the negotiating table and allow for the establishment of peace.

Some authors question the idea of international interventions at all. In a 2005 working paper for the Center for Global Development, [[Jeremy Weinstein]] of [[Stanford University]] provides a theory of “autonomous recovery,” in which states can achieve sustainable peace without international intervention. Using case studies of [[Uganda]], [[Eritrea]], and [[Somalia]], Weinstein demonstrates how states can develop effective institutions out of warfare. This method has cost and benefits that must be weighed against the potential outcome of international intervention. External intervention can stop mass atrocities, but also stop institutional change. Autonomous recovery elevates the strongest leader, but also rewards the strongest fighters who may be less inclined to share power. Furthermore, intervention depends on external influence while autonomous recovery is based on internal factors. The conclusions of his argument could suggest intervention is not ideal policy, but Weinstein argues the international community's “[[responsibility to protect]]” doctrine has moral importance for intervention and the conditions for “autonomous recovery” are very rare. Weinstein argues the fundamental challenge is how to incentivise good governance and assistance to rebel groups without disrupting the connection of citizens to rulers in terms of revenue collection that enables accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Jeremy M. 2005.

=== Mission Creep ===
Although acknowledging a number of practical and moral reasons for peacekeeping operations, James Fearon and David Laitin assert that they have a tendency under some circumstances to become tangled with [[state-building]] efforts.  In weak states facing successful guerrilla campaigns, peacekeepers face pressures to build state institutional and administrative capacity in order to achieve lasting peace.  These pressures can lead to mission creep beyond the original purview of the peacekeeping operation; without engaging in state-building, the peacekeepers risk allowing the peacekept country to revert to violence following their exit.  Thus, Fearon and Laitin advocate for the greater integration of state-building in peacekeeping efforts through a new framework of "neotrusteeship," which would see foreign powers exercising a great deal of control over a weak state's domestic affairs in order to ensure the prevention of future violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James D|last2=Laitin|first2=David D|date=2004|title=Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States|url=|journal=International Security|volume=28|pages=5–43|doi=10.1162/0162288041588296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of Engagement with the Populace===
A growing critique of peacekeeping is the lack of engagement between the peacekeeping officials and the local populace. As [[Séverine Autesserre]] outlines in a 2015 Foreign Policy article,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/06/trouble-in-peaceland-united-nations-congo-development/|title=Trouble in Peaceland|last=Autesserre|first=Severine|date=|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; this creates an environment where the peacekeeping officials develop plans to ‘keep’ the peace, but they are disconnected from reality, having the opposite effect on the ground. Additionally, it creates a reinforcement mechanism for the peacekeeping officials, because the officials on the ground report that their plan was successfully implemented, but, in reality, it had adverse effects. If the situation on the ground turns into another outbreak of violence, the local populace will be blamed.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

This criticism is similar to the critic levelled at development in developing countries by authors such as James C. Scott,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed|last=Scott|first=James C.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Ferguson, and L. Lohman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson1 LLohmann2|first=James1 L2|date=1994|title="The anti-politics machine: ’development’ and bureaucratic power in Lesotho."|url=|journal=the Ecologist|volume=24|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although peacekeeping and development are two different things, the logic behind the criticism is the same. The third-party officials-whether they are peacekeepers or agents of development-are isolated from the general populace, believing they know what is best, and refusing to gather information from a ground level. This is not out of maliciousness or imperialism, but out of a legitimate belief that they, as educated officials with access to other experts and who are well versed in development and peacekeeping literature, know what is best.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Proposed reform==

===Brahimi analysis===
In response to criticism, particularly of the cases of sexual abuse by peacekeepers, the UN has taken steps toward reforming its operations. The [[Report of the Panel on United Nations Peacekeeping|Brahimi Report]] was the first of many steps to recap former peacekeeping missions, isolate flaws, and take steps to patch these mistakes to ensure the efficiency of future peacekeeping missions. The UN has vowed to continue to put these practices into effect when performing peacekeeping operations in the future. The technocratic aspects of the reform process have been continued and revitalised by the DPKO in its "Peace Operations 2010" reform agenda. This included an increase in personnel, the harmonisation of the conditions of service of field and headquarters staff, the development of guidelines and standard operating procedures, and improving the partnership arrangement between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), [[African Union]], and [[European Union]]. A 2008 capstone doctrine entitled "United Nations Peacekeeping Operations: Principles and Guidelines"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pbpu.unlb.org/pbps/Library/Capstone_Doctrine_ENG.pdf|title=Peacekeeping Resource Hub|website=pbpu.unlb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporates and builds on the Brahimi analysis.

One of the main issues that the Brahimi report identifies is the lack of coordination and planning of the Peacekeeping Operations. Also, the difference between the objectives of the Peacekeeping Operations and the resources destined to fund the missions. Therefore, the report asks the Security Council to make clear the goals and the resources to accomplish them.  According to Fearon and Laitin, the Brahimi Report provides a political instrument for the secretary-general to negotiate with the Security Council the goals, the troops, and the resources need it to the operations. This instrument tries to avoid the cases of underfunding presented in Missions such as in Bosnia, Somalia, and Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fearon | first1 = James D | last2 = Laitin | first2 = David D | year = 2004 | title = Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States | url = | journal = International Security | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 5–43 | doi=10.1162/0162288041588296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christine Gray analyses the issues of implementing the recommendations of the Brahimi Report. She explains the difficulty in implementing these recommendations. In particular, in reducing the gap between the mandates of Security Council and the actual resources devoted to implementing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = Christine | year = 2001 | title = Peacekeeping After the ''Brahimi Report'': Is There a Crisis of Credibility for the UN?. | url = | journal = J Conflict Security Law | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 267–288 | doi=10.1093/jcsl/6.2.267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common usage is [[Australian slang]] for a man searching around for [[casual sex]], as in "on the pirate" or the verb "to pirate".&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, Jonathon (2005). ''Cassell's Dictionary of Slang.'' Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., {{ISBN|9780304366361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been used to describe a [[pimp]] who steals a prostitute from another pimp.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;

A more recent slang usage is a fictitious sex act called "the pirate" or "the angry pirate".&lt;ref name="sanchez"&gt;Denton-Brown, Nick et al (Eds.) (2009). ''Dirty Sanchez's Guide to Buck Nasty Sex.'' Ulysses Press, {{ISBN|9781569757208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex columnist [[Dan Savage]] fielded a question from a reader who asked about the act. The reader described it as "when you’re getting a [[blowjob]] from a girl, and when you cum, you  [[ejaculate]] in her eye. Then you kick her in the shin. The result is the woman is squinting her eye and hopping up and down on one foot, holding her leg and screaming, "ARRRGH!"&lt;ref name="savage2004"&gt;{{cite news |title=No Shit? |author=Dan Savage |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=20179&amp;mode=print |newspaper=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |date=December 23–29, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage replied &lt;!--This quotation preserves the capitalization in the original source material.--&gt;"no one has ever attempted "the Pirate," just as no one has ever performed a [[Hot Karl (slang)|Hot Karl]], delivered a [[donkey punch]], or inserted an [[Icy Mike]]. They’re all fictions." &lt;ref name="savage2004" /&gt; Author Jordan Tate, commenting in ''The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms'' (2007) said this "falls into the class of theoretical euphemisms that are infrequent, impractical, and violent."&lt;ref name="Tate2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jordan Tate|title=The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aclMh6SB1ngC|accessdate=15 February 2012|date=9 January 2007|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-36298-0|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tate said these terms originated sometime after the [[sexual revolution]], when the empowerment of women was threatening the place of men in contemporary society. [...] This shift in gender paradigms left men feeling threatened, and to reassert their authority, they created and popularized these theoretical and violent euphemisms.&lt;ref name="Tate2007" /&gt;

==Compound words==

The term is also used in [[compound words]], including "tango pirate," popularized in the early 20th century to describe [[gigolo]]s who sought out wealthy women at dances.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt; The terms "butt pirate" or "ass pirate" or "poo pirate" have been used as [[sexual slur]]s for [[gay men]].&lt;ref name="Dalzell"/&gt; The term "Pamper pirate" has been used to describe a [[child molester]].&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;

'''Power harassment''' is [[harassment]] or unwelcome attention of a political nature, often occurring in the environment of a workplace including hospitals, schools and universities. It includes a range of behavior from mild irritation and annoyances to serious [[abuse]]s which can even involve forced activity beyond the boundaries of the job description. Power harassment is considered a form of illegal [[discrimination]] and is a form of political and [[psychological abuse]], and [[bullying]].

==By country==
===Japan===
Although the phenomenon power harassment is not uniquely Japanese, since it has occurred in many environments, the term is a Japanese coinage.  It has received significant attention in Japan in recent years as a workplace problem.&lt;ref&gt;''Rochelle Kopp'' (2012).[http://www.japanintercultural.com/en/news/default.aspx?newsid=167 Power Harassment], ''Japan Intercultural Consulting''&lt;/ref&gt; For many Japanese, the only kind of management style they have ever experienced is one in which subordinates are treated harshly and no complaints are tolerated.  This makes the nightmare boss seem normal, and those who have never had a different role model for management style find themselves falling back on the old methods.  And indeed, many Japanese admire authoritarian bosses, finding them to be strong and admiring their "passion" that may be expressed in angry outbursts.&lt;ref&gt;''Rochelle Kopp'' (2014). [http://www.japanintercultural.com/en/news/default.aspx?newsID=292 Power harassment – Japanese workplace bullying]. ''Japan Intercultural Consulting''&lt;/ref&gt;    The term itself was coined by Yasuko Okada in 2002&lt;ref&gt;''Yasuko Okada (岡田康子)'' [https://www.tokyo-jinken.or.jp/publication/tj_15_relay.html 職場で深刻化する「パワー・ハラスメント」]. In TOKYO JINKEN vol. 15. (Published 2002-09-20 by Tokyo Metropolitan Human Rights Promotion Center) (Available only in Japanese). &lt;/ref&gt; and is used mainly in Japan. It is analogous to "[[abuse of authority]]" or [[rankism]] in the workplace. Yuichiro Makiguchi is one of the researchers of power harassment at [[Tokoha Gakuen Junior College]] in Japan.

===South Korea===
{{main|Gabjil}}
The topic of power harassment is known in South Korea as [[Gabjil]], and it has been recently increasingly discussed in Korean media and scholarly works.

==Example==
Many workers are forced by their [[Superior (hierarchy)|superiors]] to perform tasks outside of their job description and [[working time|working hours]]. It is common for workers to be fired or suffer severe repercussions if they do not satisfy their superior's orders, despite there being no justifiable basis for such orders. 
Situations exist where employees are treated in a manner that far oversteps the bounds of what is proper between a boss and his or her workers. Someone in a position of power should never be allowed to exercise the power in a [[workplace bullying|bullying]] or discriminatory fashion. This can create an unhappy and unsafe work environment not just for those being harassed but for the entire work force. 
Typical examples of power harassment include: 
# being scolded in front of other colleagues, rebuked in a loud voice
# [[neglect]]
# false evaluation and demotion.

{{Criminology and penology |penology}}

'''Prisoner abuse''' is the mistreatment of persons while they are under arrest or incarcerated, therefore deprived of the [[right of self-defense]] against acting authorities and generally defenseless in actual fact.

Abuse falling into this category includes:
* [[Physical abuse]]: Illicit beating and hitting, unlawful [[corporal punishment]], [[stress position]]s, excessive or prolonged [[physical restraints|physical restraining]], etc.
* [[Psychological abuse]]: [[Verbal abuse]], [[sleep deprivation]], [[white noise]], pointless/absurd or [[humiliation|humiliating]] instructions, recurrent exhaustive [[inspection]]s and [[Police raid|shakedowns]], arbitrary [[strip search]]es, denuding actions, exposure, etc.
* [[Sexual abuse]]: Excessive [[body cavity search|vaginal or rectal contraband searches]] or other internal checks, forced [[sexual intercourse]], forced insertion of objects into vagina or rectum, arbitrary [[strip search]]es, denuding actions, etc. (Sexual abuse is thematically widely overlapping with psychological abuse.)
* [[Enhanced interrogation]]: methods implemented in the [[War on Terror]] purportedly needed to extract information from detainees.
* [[Torture]]: any act, whether physical or psychological, which is deliberately done to inflict excruciating and agonizing pain upon a person under the actor's custody or physical control for any reason such as extracting information or punishment.
* Other abuse: Refusal of essential medication, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Prisoner Abuse Law &amp; Legal Definition. ''USLegal''. Retrieved from http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/prisoner-abuse/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological abuse ==
===White noise===
The endless playing of random static (similar to that of unused TV frequencies) with no pattern; this can cause extreme discomfort and disorientation.

===Verbal abuse===
Prisoners may be subject to taunting, heckling, profanity, and malicious lies by prison authorities.  Guards and other authorities may use verbal abuse as a means of frightening or demoralizing prisoners to make them more compliant, or simply out of sadism.

===Enablement of sexual violence===
Prisoners are sometimes intentionally housed with inmates known to have raped other prisoners, or protection from known rapists may be purposely withheld from the prisoners. These practices create a very high incidence of [[prison rape in the United States|rape in US prisons]], which was the topic of the 2001 report No Escape from Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/|title=No Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons|author=|date=|website=www.hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plenary 2 -- Redefining Gender Violence -- Transcripts from Converge!

[[Image:Real projective line.svg|right|thumb|
The projectively extended real line can be visualized as the real number line wrapped around a circle (by some form of [[stereographic projection]]) with an additional point at infinity.]]

In [[real analysis]], the '''projectively extended real line''' (also called the [[one-point compactification]] of the [[real line]]), is the extension of the [[number line]] by a point denoted {{math|∞}}. It is thus the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of the [[real number]]s) with the standard arithmetic operations extended where possible, sometimes denoted by &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}.&lt;/math&gt; The added point is called the [[point at infinity]], because it is considered as a neighbour of both [[End (topology)|ends]] of the real line. More precisely, the point at infinity is the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of every sequence of real numbers whose absolute values are increasing and unbounded.

The projectively extended real line may be identified with the [[projective line]] over the reals in which three points have been assigned specific values (e.g. {{math|0}}, {{math|1}} and {{math|∞}}). The projectively extended real line must not be confused with the [[extended real number line]], in which {{math|+∞}} and {{math|−∞}} are distinct.

==Dividing by zero==

Unlike most mathematical models of the intuitive concept of 'number', this structure allows [[division by zero]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{0} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

for nonzero ''a''.  In particular {{math|1/0 {{=}} ∞}}, and moreover {{math|1/∞ {{=}} 0}}, making [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]], {{math|1/''x''}}, a [[total function]] in this structure.  The structure, however, is not a [[field (mathematics)|field]], and none of the binary arithmetic operations are total, as witnessed for example by {{math|0⋅∞}} being undefined despite the reciprocal being total. It has usable interpretations, however – for example, in geometry, a vertical line has ''infinite'' [[slope]].

==Extensions of the real line==

The projectively extended real line extends the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s in the same way that the [[Riemann sphere]] extends the field of [[complex number]]s, by adding a single point called conventionally &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

In contrast, the [[extended real number line]] (also called the two-point [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of the real line) distinguishes between &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

==Order==
The order relation cannot be extended to &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; in a meaningful way. Given a number &lt;math&gt;a \ne \infty&lt;/math&gt;, there is no convincing argument to define either &lt;math&gt;a &gt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; or that &lt;math&gt;a &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; can't be compared with any of the other elements, there's no point in retaining this relation on &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;. However, order on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is used in definitions in &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Geometry==

Fundamental to the idea that &amp;infin; is a point ''no different from any other'' is the way the real projective line is a [[homogeneous space]], in fact [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[circle]]. For example the [[general linear group]] of 2×2 real [[invertible]] matrices has a [[transitive action]] on it. The [[group action]] may be expressed by [[Möbius transformation]]s, (also called linear fractional transformations), with the understanding that when the denominator of the linear fractional transformation is 0, the image is &amp;infin;.

The detailed analysis of the action shows that for any three distinct points ''P'', ''Q'' and ''R'', there is a linear fractional transformation taking ''P'' to 0, ''Q'' to 1, and ''R''  to &amp;infin; that is, the group of linear fractional transformations is triply [[transitive action|transitive]] on the real projective line. This cannot be extended to 4-tuples of points, because the [[cross-ratio]] is invariant.

The terminology [[projective line]] is appropriate, because the points are in 1-to-1 correspondence with one-dimensional [[linear subspace]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Arithmetic operations==

===Motivation for arithmetic operations===
The arithmetic operations on this space are an extension of the same operations on reals. A motivation for the new definitions is the limits of functions of real numbers.

===Arithmetic operations that are defined===
In addition to the standard operations on the subset &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, the following operations are defined for &lt;math&gt;a \in \widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, with exceptions as indicated:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a + \infty = \infty + a &amp; = \infty, &amp; a \neq \infty \\
a - \infty = \infty - a &amp; = \infty, &amp; a \neq \infty \\
a / \infty = a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a &amp; = 0, &amp; a \neq \infty \\
\infty / a &amp; = \infty, &amp; a \neq \infty \\
a / 0 = a \cdot \infty = \infty \cdot a &amp; = \infty, &amp; a \neq 0 \\
0 / a &amp; = 0, &amp; a \neq 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Arithmetic operations that are left undefined===
The following expressions cannot be motivated by considering limits of real functions, and no definition of them allows the statement of the standard algebraic properties to be retained unchanged in form for all defined cases.{{efn|An extension does however exist in which all the algebraic properties, when restricted to defined operations in &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, resolve to the standard rules: see [[Wheel theory]].}} Consequently, they are left undefined:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \infty + \infty \\
&amp; \infty - \infty \\
&amp; \infty \cdot 0 \\
&amp; 0 \cdot \infty \\
&amp; \infty / \infty \\
&amp; 0 / 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Algebraic properties==
The following equalities mean: ''Either both sides are undefined, or both sides are defined and equal.'' This is true for any &lt;math&gt;a, b, c \in \widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(a + b) + c &amp; = a + (b + c) \\
a + b &amp; = b + a \\
(a \cdot b) \cdot c &amp; = a \cdot (b \cdot c) \\
a \cdot b &amp; = b \cdot a \\
a \cdot \infty &amp; = \frac{a}{0} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The following is true whenever the right-hand side is defined, for any &lt;math&gt;a, b, c \in \widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a \cdot (b + c) &amp; = a \cdot b + a \cdot c \\
a &amp; = (\frac{a}{b}) \cdot b &amp; = \,\,&amp; \frac{(a \cdot b)}{b} \\
a &amp; = (a + b) - b &amp; = \,\,&amp; (a - b) + b
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
In general, all laws of arithmetic that are valid for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are also valid for &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; whenever all the occurring expressions are defined.

==Intervals and topology==
The concept of an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] can be extended to &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;. However, since it is an unordered set, the interval has a slightly different meaning. The definitions for closed intervals are as follows (it is assumed that 
&lt;math&gt;a, b \in \mathbb{R}, a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\left[a, b\right] &amp; = \lbrace x \mid x \in \mathbb{R}, a \leq x \leq b \rbrace  \\
\left[a, \infty\right] &amp; = \lbrace x \mid x \in \mathbb{R}, a \leq x \rbrace  \cup \lbrace \infty \rbrace  \\
\left[b, a\right] &amp; = \lbrace x \mid x \in \mathbb{R}, b \leq x \rbrace  \cup \lbrace \infty \rbrace \cup \lbrace x \mid x \in \mathbb{R}, x \leq a \rbrace  \\
\left[\infty, a\right] &amp; = \lbrace \infty \rbrace \cup \lbrace x \mid x \in \mathbb{R}, x \leq a \rbrace  \\
\left[a, a\right] &amp; = \{ a \}  \\
\left[\infty, \infty\right] &amp; = \lbrace \infty \rbrace 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

With the exception of when the end-points are equal, the corresponding open and half-open intervals are defined by removing the respective endpoints.

&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; and the empty set are each also an interval, as is &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; excluding any single point.{{efn|If consistency of complementation is required, such that &lt;math&gt;[a,b]^\complement = (b,a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a,b]^\complement = (b,a]&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a, b \in \widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; (where the interval on either side is defined), all intervals excluding &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; may be naturally represented using this notation, with &lt;math&gt;(a,a)&lt;/math&gt; being interpreted as &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}\setminus \{ a \}&lt;/math&gt;, and half-open intervals with equal endpoints, e.g. &lt;math&gt;(a,a]&lt;/math&gt;, remaining undefined.}}

The open intervals as [[base (topology)|base]] define a [[topological space|topology]] on &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;. Sufficient for a base are the finite open intervals in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and the intervals &lt;math&gt;(b, a) = \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{R}, b &lt; x\} \cup \{\infty\} \cup \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{R}, x &lt; a\}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a, b \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;.

As said, the topology is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a [[circle]]. Thus it is [[metrizable]] corresponding (for a given homeomorphism) to the ordinary metric on this circle (either measured straight or along the circle). There is no metric which is an extension of the ordinary metric on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Interval arithmetic==
[[Interval arithmetic]] extends to &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. The result of an arithmetic operation on intervals is always an interval, except when the intervals with a binary operation contain incompatible values leading to an undefined result.{{efn|For example, the ratio of intervals &lt;math&gt;[0,1]/[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; in both intervals, and since &lt;math&gt;0/0&lt;/math&gt; is undefined, the result of division of these intervals is undefined.}} In particular, we have, for every &lt;math&gt;a, b \in \widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;x \in [a, b] \iff \frac{1}{x} \in \left[ \frac{1}{b}, \frac{1}{a} \right] ,&lt;/math&gt;
irrespective of whether either interval includes &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

==Calculus==
The tools of [[calculus]] can be used to analyze functions of &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;. The definitions are motivated by the topology of this space.

===Neighbourhoods===
Let &lt;math&gt;x \in \widehat{\mathbb{R}}, A \subseteq \widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;.
*''A'' is a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of ''x'', [[if and only if]] ''A'' contains an open interval ''B'' and &lt;math&gt;x \in B&lt;/math&gt;.
*''A'' is a right-sided neighbourhood of x, if and only if there is &lt;math&gt;y \in \widehat{\mathbb{R}}\setminus \{x\}&lt;/math&gt; such that ''A'' contains &lt;math&gt;[x, y)&lt;/math&gt;.
*''A'' is a left-sided neighbourhood of x, if and only if there is &lt;math&gt;y \in \widehat{\mathbb{R}}\setminus \{x\}&lt;/math&gt; such that ''A'' contains  &lt;math&gt;(y, x]&lt;/math&gt;.
*''A'' is a (right-sided, left-sided) [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)#Punctured neighbourhood|punctured neighbourhood]] of ''x'', if and only if there is &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq \widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; such that ''B'' is a (right-sided, left-sided) neighbourhood of x, and &lt;math&gt;A = B \setminus \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Limits===

====Basic definitions of limits====
Let &lt;math&gt;f : \widehat{\mathbb{R}} \to \widehat{\mathbb{R}}, p \in \widehat{\mathbb{R}}, L \in \widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[limit of a function|limit]] of ''f(x)'' as ''x'' approaches ''p'' is ''L'', denoted
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to p}{f(x)} = L&lt;/math&gt;
if and only if for every neighbourhood ''A'' of ''L'', there is a punctured neighbourhood ''B'' of ''p'', such that &lt;math&gt;x \in B&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;f(x) \in A&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[one-sided limit]] of ''f(x)'' as ''x'' approaches ''p'' from the right (left) is ''L'', denoted
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to p^{+}}{f(x)} = L&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\left (\lim_{x \to p^{-}}{f(x)} = L\right )&lt;/math&gt;
if and only if for every neighbourhood ''A'' of ''L'', there is a right-sided (left-sided) punctured neighbourhood ''B'' of ''p'', such that &lt;math&gt;x \in B&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;f(x) \in A&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to p}{f(x)} = L&lt;/math&gt; if and only if both &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to p^{+}}{f(x)} = L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to p^{-}}{f(x)} = L&lt;/math&gt;.

====Comparison with limits in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;====
The definitions given above can be compared with the usual definitions of limits of real functions. In the following statements, &lt;math&gt;p, L \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, the first limit is as defined above, and the second limit is in the usual sense:
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to p}{f(x)} = L&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to p}{f(x)} = L&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty^{+}}{f(x)} = L&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to -\infty}{f(x)} = L&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty^{-}}{f(x)} = L&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to +\infty}{f(x)} = L&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to p}{f(x)} = \infty&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to p}{|f(x)|} = +\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty^{+}}{f(x)} = \infty&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to -\infty}{|f(x)|} = +\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty^{-}}{f(x)} = \infty&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to +\infty}{|f(x)|} = +\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

====Extended definition of limits====
Let &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''p'' is a [[limit point]] of ''A'' if and only if every neighbourhood of ''p'' includes a point &lt;math&gt;y \in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y \neq p&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;f : \widehat{\mathbb{R}} \to \widehat{\mathbb{R}}, A \subseteq \widehat{\mathbb{R}}, L \in \widehat{\mathbb{R}}, p \in \widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, ''p'' a limit point of ''A''. The limit of ''f(x)'' as ''x'' approaches ''p'' through ''A'' is ''L'', if and only if for every neighbourhood ''B'' of ''L'', there is a punctured neighbourhood ''C'' of ''p'', such that &lt;math&gt;x \in A \cap C&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;f(x) \in B&lt;/math&gt;.

This corresponds to the regular topological definition of continuity, applied to the [[subspace topology]] on &lt;math&gt;A\cup \lbrace p \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;, and the restriction of ''f'' to &lt;math&gt;A\cup \lbrace p \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;.

===Continuity===

Let

: &lt;math&gt;f : \widehat{\mathbb{R}} \to \widehat{\mathbb{R}},\quad p \in \widehat{\mathbb{R}}.&lt;/math&gt;

''f'' is [[Continuous function|continuous]] at ''p'' if and only if ''f'' is defined at ''p'' and:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to p}{f(x)} = f(p).&lt;/math&gt;

Let

: &lt;math&gt;f : \widehat{\mathbb{R}} \to \widehat{\mathbb{R}},\quad A \subseteq \widehat{\mathbb{R}}.&lt;/math&gt;

''f'' is continuous in ''A'' if and only if for every &lt;math&gt;p \in A&lt;/math&gt;, ''f'' is defined at ''p'' and the limit of ''f''(''x'') as ''x'' approaches ''p'' through ''A'' is ''f''(''p'').

An interesting feature is that every [[rational function]] ''P''(''x'')/''Q''(''x''), where ''P''(''x'') and ''Q''(''x'') have no common factor, is continuous in &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;. Also, If tan is extended so that

: &lt;math&gt;\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi\right) = \infty\text{ for }n \in \mathbb{Z},&lt;/math&gt;

then tan is continuous in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. However, many [[elementary function (differential algebra)|elementary function]]s, such as [[trigonometric functions|trigonometric]] and [[Exponential function|exponential]] functions, are discontinuous at &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. For example, sin is continuous in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; but discontinuous  at &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus 1/''x'' is continuous on  &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; but not on the [[affinely extended real number system]] &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, the function arctan can be extended continuously on &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, but not on &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==As a projective range==
{{Main|Projective range}}
When the [[real projective line]] is considered in the context of the [[real projective plane]], then the consequences of [[Desargues' theorem]] are implicit. In particular, the construction of the [[projective harmonic conjugate]] relation between points is part of the structure of the real projective line. For instance, given any pair of points, the [[point at infinity]] is the projective harmonic conjugate of their [[midpoint]].

As [[projectivity|projectivities]] preserve the harmonic relation, they form the [[automorphism]]s of the real projective line. The projectivities are described algebraically as [[homography|homographies]], since the [[real number]]s form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], according to the general construction of a [[projective line over a ring]]. Collectively they form the group [[PGL(2,R)]].

The projectivities which are their own inverses are called [[involution (mathematics)#Projective geometry|involutions]]. A '''hyperbolic involution'''  has two [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s. Two of these correspond to elementary, arithmetic operations on the real projective line: [[additive inverse|negation]] and [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocation]]. Indeed, 0 and ∞ are fixed under negation, while 1 and &amp;minus;1 are fixed under reciprocation.

[[File:Reaction wheel02.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;A momentum/reaction wheel comprising part of a high accuracy Conical Earth Sensor to maintain a satellite's precise attitude]]
A '''reaction wheel''' (RW) is a type of [[flywheel]] used primarily by [[spacecraft]] for three axis [[attitude control]], which doesn't require [[Rocket engine|rocket]]s or external applicators of torque. They provide a high pointing accuracy,&lt;ref name=smad&gt;{{cite book|title=Space Mission Analysis and Design|edition=3|author=Wiley J Larson and James R Wertz |publisher=Microcosm Press |isbn=1-881883-10-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|362}} and are particularly useful when the spacecraft must be rotated by very small amounts, such as keeping a telescope pointed at a star.

A reaction wheel is sometimes operated as (and referred to as) a '''momentum wheel''', by operating it at a constant (or near-constant) rotation speed, in order to imbue a satellite with a large amount of stored angular momentum. Doing so alters the spacecraft's rotational dynamics so that disturbance torques perpendicular to one axis of the satellite (the axis parallel to the wheel's spin axis) do not result directly in spacecraft angular motion about the same axis as the disturbance torque; instead, they result in (generally smaller) angular motion ([[precession]]) of that spacecraft axis about a perpendicular axis. This has the effect of tending to stabilize that spacecraft axis to point in a nearly-fixed direction&lt;ref name=smad/&gt;{{rp|362}}, allowing for a less-complicated attitude control system. Satellites using this "momentum-bias" stabilization approach include [[SCISAT-1]]; by orienting the momentum wheel's axis to be parallel to the orbit-normal vector, this satellite is in a "pitch momentum bias" configuration.

A [[control moment gyroscope]] (CMG) is a related but different type of attitude actuator, generally consisting of a momentum wheel mounted in a one-axis or two-axis [[gimbal]].&lt;ref name=smad/&gt;{{rp|362}} When mounted to a rigid spacecraft, applying a constant torque to the wheel using one of the gimbal motors causes the spacecraft to develop a constant angular velocity about a perpendicular axis, thus allowing control of the spacecraft's pointing direction. CMGs are generally able to produce larger sustained torques than RWs with less motor heating, and are preferentially used in larger and/or more-agile spacecraft, including [[Skylab]], [[Mir]], and the [[International Space Station]].

==Theory==
Reaction wheels are used to control the attitude of a satellite without the use of thrusters, which reduces the [[payload fraction|mass fraction]] needed for fuel. 

They work by equipping the spacecraft with an electric motor attached to a flywheel which, when its rotation speed is changed, causes the spacecraft to begin to counter-rotate proportionately through [[Angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|conservation of angular momentum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NASA |url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff1997/t3.html |title=Reaction/Momentum Wheel |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction wheels can rotate a spacecraft only around its center of mass (see [[torque]]); they are not capable of moving the spacecraft from one place to another (see [[translation (physics)|translational force]]).

== Implementation ==
For three axis control, reaction wheels must be mounted along at least three directions, with extra wheels providing additional redundancy to the attitude control system. A redundant mounting configuration could consist of four wheels along tetrahedral axes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kleinsatelliten.de/flying_laptop/systeme/lageregelung.en.html|title=Attitude Control|publisher=Universität Stuttgart Institut für Raumfahrtsysteme|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a spare wheel carried in addition to a three axis configuration.&lt;ref name=smad/&gt;{{rp|369}} Changes in speed (in either direction) are controlled electronically by computer. The strength of the materials used in a reaction wheel determine the speed at which the wheel would come apart, and therefore how much [[angular momentum]] it can store.

Since the reaction wheel is a small fraction of the spacecraft's total mass, easily controlled, temporary changes in its speed result in small changes in angle. The wheels therefore permit very precise changes in a spacecraft's [[attitude control|attitude]]. For this reason, reaction wheels are often used to aim spacecraft carrying cameras or telescopes.

Over time, reaction wheels may build up enough stored momentum to exceed the maximum speed of the wheel, called saturation, which will need to be cancelled. Designers therefore supplement reaction wheel systems with other attitude control mechanisms. In the presence of a magnetic field (as in low Earth orbit), a spacecraft can employ [[magnetorquer]]s (better known as torque rods) to transfer angular momentum to the Earth through its planetary magnetic field.&lt;ref name=smad/&gt;{{rp|368}} In the absence of a magnetic field, the most efficient practice is to use either high-efficiency attitude jets such as [[ion thruster]]s, or small, lightweight [[solar sail]]s placed in locations away from the spacecraft's center of mass, such as on solar cell arrays or projecting masts.  Most{{dubious|date=June 2018}} spacecraft, however, also need fast pointing, and cannot afford the extra mass of three attitude control systems.  Designers therefore usually use conventional [[monopropellant rocket|monopropellant]] [[vernier engine]]s for all these purposes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Failures and mission impact ==
The failure of one or more reaction wheels can cause a spacecraft to lose its ability to maintain attitude (orientation) and thus potentially cause a mission failure. Recent studies&lt;ref&gt;W. Bialke, E. Hansell "[http://esmats.eu/esmatspapers/pastpapers/pdfs/2017/bialke.pdf A Newly Discovered Branch of the Fault Tree Explaining Systemic Reaction Wheel Failures And Anomalies]", 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; conclude that these failures can be correlated with [[space weather]] effects.

;Hubble: Two servicing missions to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] have replaced a reaction wheel. In February 1997, the Second Servicing Mission ([[STS-82]]) replaced one&lt;ref name="Hubblesite, RW" &gt;{{cite web

;Hayabusa: In 2004, during the mission of the ''[[Hayabusa]]'' spacecraft, an X-axis reaction wheel failed. The Y-axis wheel failed in 2005, causing the craft to rely on chemical thrusters to maintain attitude control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/hyabusa/|title=Hayabusa|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=May 15, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601154943/http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/hyabusa/|archivedate=June 1, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Kepler:From July 2012 to May 11, 2013, two out of the four reaction wheels in the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'' telescope]] failed. This loss severely hampered ''Kepler''{{'s}} ability to maintain a sufficiently precise orientation to continue its original mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Salon des Refusés''', French for "exhibition of rejects" ({{IPA-fr|salɔ̃ de ʁəfyze}}), is generally an exhibition of works rejected by the jury of the official [[Paris Salon]], but the term is most famously used to refer to the ''Salon des Refusés'' of 1863.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k114147v Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, gravure, lithographie et architecture : refusés par le Jury de 1863 et exposés, par décision de S.M. l'Empereur au salon annexe, palais des Champs-Elysées, le 15 mai 1863], Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boime"&gt;{{cite journal

Today by extension, ''salon des refusés'' refers to any exhibition of works rejected from a juried art show.

==Background of the Salon of 1863==
The [[Paris Salon]], sponsored by the French government and the Academy of Fine Arts, took place annually, and was a showcase of the best academic art.  A medal from the Salon was assurance of a successful artistic career;  winners were given official commissions by the French government, and were sought after for portraits and private commissions.  Since the 18th century, the paintings were classified by genre, following a specific hierarchy;  history paintings were ranked first, followed by the portrait, the landscape, the "genre scene", and the still life.  The jury, headed by the Comte de Nieuwerkerke, the head of the Academy of Fine Arts, was very conservative; near-photographic but idealized realism was expected.&lt;ref&gt;Meneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial- la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire'' Éditions Armand Colin, (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Much intrigue often went on to get acceptance, and to be given a good place in the galleries.  In 1851, [[Gustave Courbet]] managed to get one painting into the Salon, ''Enterrement á Ornans'', and in 1852 his ''Baigneuses'' was accepted, scandalizing critics and the public, who expected romanticized nudes in classical settings, but in 1855 the Salon refused all of Courbet's paintings.  As early as the 1830s, Paris art galleries mounted small-scale, private exhibitions of works rejected by the Salon jurors.  Courbet was obliged to organize his own exhibit, called ''Le Realism'', at a private gallery.  Private exhibits attracted far less attention from the press and patrons, and limited the access of the artists to a small public.

In 1863 the Salon jury refused two thirds of the paintings presented, including the works of [[Gustave Courbet]],  [[Édouard Manet]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Johan Jongkind]]. The rejected artists and their friends protested, and the protests reached Emperor [[Napoleon III]]. The Emperor's tastes in art were traditional; he commissioned and bought works by artists such as [[Alexandre Cabanel]] and [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]], but he was also sensitive to public opinion. His office issued a statement: "Numerous complaints have come to the Emperor on the subject of the works of art which were refused by the jury of the Exposition.  His Majesty, wishing to let the public judge the legitimacy of these complaints, has decided that the works of art which were refused should be displayed in another part of the Palace of Industry."&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''Le Moniteur'' on 24 April 1863. Cited in Maneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial - La vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire,'' p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than a thousand visitors a day visited the Salon des Refusés. The journalist [[Émile Zola]] reported that visitors pushed  to get into the crowded galleries where the refused paintings were hung, and the rooms were full of the laughter of the spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Meneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial- la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire,'' Éditions Armand Colin, (1990). p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics and the public ridiculed the ''refusés'', which included such now-famous paintings as [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' and James McNeill Whistler's ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl]]''. But the critical attention also legitimized the emerging avant-garde in painting.

The Impressionists successfully exhibited their works outside the traditional Salon beginning in 1874. Subsequent Salons des Refusés were mounted in Paris in 1874, 1875, and 1886, by which time the popularity of the Paris Salon had declined for those who were more interested in Impressionism.

Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit ''[[Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refusés.&lt;ref name="Boime 2007 676"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boime|first=Albert|title=Art in an Age of Civil Struggle|year=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-226-06328-7|pages=676}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Déjeuner sur l'herbe'' depicts the juxtaposition of a [[female nude]] and a scantily dressed female bather in the background, on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. The painting sparked public notoriety and stirred up controversy and has remained controversial, even to this day. [[Odilon Redon]], for example, did not like it. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in [[Proust]]'s ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]''.

One interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution in the ''[[Bois de Boulogne]]'', a large park at the western outskirts of Paris, at the time. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Gartner, ''Art and Architecture: Musee D'Orsay'', 2001, p. 180. {{ISBN|0-7607-2889-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the ''Bois de Boulogne'' is to this day known as a pick-up place for prostitutes and illicit sexual activity after dark, just as it had been in the 19th century.

[[Émile Zola]] comments about ''Déjeuner sur l'herbe'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Luncheon on the Grass'' is the greatest work of Édouard Manet, one in which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape.  We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty.  There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air.  This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas.  My God!  What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men!  That has never been seen.  And this belief is a gross error, for in the [[Louvre]] there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude.  But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized.  The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience.  Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists.  Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh.  That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves.  It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Zola, ''Édouard Manet,'' 1867,  et lps 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Émile Zola]] incorporated a fictionalized account of the 1863 scandal in his novel ''[[L'Œuvre]]'' ''(The Masterpiece)'' (1886).

In 1861, after returning to Paris for a time, [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] painted his first famous work, ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl]]''. This portrait of his mistress and business manager [[Joanna Hiffernan]] was created as a simple study in white; however, others saw it differently. The critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]] thought the painting an allegory of a new bride's lost innocence. Others linked it to [[Wilkie Collins]]'s ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'', a popular novel of the time, or various other literary sources. In England, some considered it a painting in the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] manner.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson and Koval, pgs. 106, 119&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting, Hiffernan holds a lily in her left hand and stands upon a bear skin rug (interpreted by some to represent masculinity and lust) with the bear's head staring menacingly at the viewer.

Countering criticism by traditionalists, Whistler's supporters insisted that the painting was "an apparition with a spiritual content" and that it epitomized his theory that art should be concerned essentially with the arrangement of colors in harmony, not with a literal portrayal of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Whistler started working on ''The White Girl'' shortly after December 3, 1861, with the intention of submitting it to the prestigious [[Royal Academy summer exhibition|annual exhibition]] of the [[Royal Academy]]. In spite of bouts of illness, he finished the painting by April .&lt;ref name="Sp300"&gt;Spencer (1998), p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait was refused for exhibition at the conservative Royal Academy, but in 1863 it was accepted at the Salon des Refusés in Paris, an event sponsored by Emperor [[Napoleon III]] for the exhibition of works rejected from the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/whistlersite/whitegirl.htm Whistler explained his purpose in making the painting, ''Symphony in White''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905065722/http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/whistlersite/whitegirl.htm |date=2013-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[George du Maurier]] in early 1862 Whistler wrote of the painting:

{{quote|... a woman in a beautiful white cambric dress, standing against a window which filters the light through a transparent white muslin curtain – but the figure receives a strong light from the right and therefore the picture, barring the red hair, is one gorgeous mass of brilliant white.&lt;ref name="Taylor27"&gt;Taylor (1978), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Whistler submitted the painting to the Academy, but according to Joanna Hiffernan, he expected it to be rejected.&lt;ref name="Sp300"/&gt; The previous year, in 1861, another painting had caused a minor scandal. [[Edwin Henry Landseer]]'s ''The Shrew Tamed'' showed a horse with a woman resting on the ground nearby. The model was named as Ann Gilbert,&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Saturday, May 04, 1861; pg. 12; Issue 23924; col A&lt;/ref&gt; a noted equestrienne of the period,&lt;ref&gt;She offered her professional services to render ladies' horses "quiet, safe and pleasant to ride":''The Times'', Friday, Jun 20, 1856; pg. 2; Issue 22399; col A&lt;/ref&gt; however it was soon rumored that it was actually [[Catherine Walters]], the notorious London [[courtesan]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine Vol. 90 (550) Aug 1861 Page 211:'"The Shrew Tamed" - a high-bred horse of soft silken coat, dappled with play of light and shade as on velvet, subdued by a "pretty horsebreaker", is certainly unfortunate as a subject. This picture has been made the more notorious by "The Belgravian Lament", which took the well-known rider as a text whereon to point a moral. We hope it will now be felt by Sir Edwin Landseer and his friends that the intrusion of "pretty horsebreakers" on the walls of the Academy is not less to be regretted than their presence in Rotten Row.'&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler's painting was reminiscent enough of Landseer's that the judges were wary of admitting it.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer (1998), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; ''White Girl'' was submitted to the Academy along with three etchings, all three of which were accepted, while the painting was not.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson &amp; Koval (1994), pp. 129–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler exhibited it at the small Berners Street Gallery in London instead.&lt;ref name="Taylor27"/&gt; The next year, Whistler tried to have the painting exhibited at the ''Salon'' in Paris – the official art exhibition of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] – but it was rejected there as well.&lt;ref name="Craven"&gt;Craven (2003), pp. 342–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it was accepted at the alternative ''Salon des Refusés'' – the "exhibition of rejects" that opened on May 15, two weeks after the official ''Salon''.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub (1974), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although others said while Whistler's painting was widely noticed, he was upstaged by Manet's more shocking painting ''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe''.&lt;ref name="Craven"/&gt; The controversy surrounding the paintings was described in [[Émile Zola]]'s novel ''[[L'Œuvre]]'' (1886).&lt;ref name="Sp300"/&gt; The reception Whistler's painting received was mostly favourable, however, and largely vindicated him after the rejection he had experienced both in London and in Paris.&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;Newton &amp; MacDonald (1978), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was greatly admired by his colleagues and friends Manet, the painter [[Gustave Courbet]] and the poet [[Charles Baudelaire]]. The art critic [[Théophile Thoré-Bürger]] saw it in the tradition of [[Francisco Goya|Goya]] and [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]. There were, however, those who were less favourable; certain French critics saw the English Pre-Raphaelite trend as somewhat eccentric.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer (1998), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Art historian [[Albert Boime]] wrote: "The Salon des Refusés introduced the democratic concept of a multi-style system (much like a multi-party system) subject to the review of the general jury of the public."&lt;ref name="Boime"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30243">The '''self-reference effect''' is a tendency for people to encode information differently depending on the level on which they are implicated in the information. When people are asked to remember information when it is related in some way to themselves, the recall rate can be improved.&lt;ref name=Self-reference&gt;{{Citation |last=Rogers |first=Timothy B. |last2=Kuiper |first2=Nicholas A. |last3=Kirker |first3=W.S. |title=Self-Reference and the Encoding of Personal Information |year=1977 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=677–678 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.9.677 |pmid=909043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In 1955, [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] published his theory about how humans create [[personal construct]]s. This was a more general cognitive theory based on the idea that each individual's psychological processes are influenced by the way they anticipate events. This lays the groundwork for the ideas of personal constructs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Psychology of Personal Constructs |last=Kelly |first=George |year=1955 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |isbn=9780230008410}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attribution theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=E. E. |title=Attribution: Perceiving the causes of success and failure |year=1971 |publisher=General Learning Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an explanation of the way people attribute the causes of behavior and events, which also involved creating a construct of self, since people can explain things related to themselves differently from the same thing happening to someone else. Related to the attribution theory, the fundamental attribution error&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tal-Or |first1=Nurit |last2=Papirman |first2=Yael |title=The Fundamental Attribution Error in Attributing Fictional Figures' Characteristics to the Actors |journal=Media Psychology |date=2007 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=331–345 |doi=10.1080/15213260701286049}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an explanation of when an individual explains someone's given behavior in a situation through emphasis on internal characteristics (personality) rather than considering the situation's external factors. Studies such as one by Jones, Sensenig, and Haley&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jones |first=R. A. |last2=Sensenig |first2=J. |last3=Haley |first3=J. V. |title=Self-descriptions: Configurations of content and order effects |year=1974 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=36–45 |doi=10.1037/h0036674|pmid=4427215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; corroborated the idea that the self has a special construct, by simply asking experiment subjects to describe their "most significant characteristics". The results showed that the majority of responses were based on positive characteristics such as "sensitive", "intelligent", and "friendly". This ties in very well with other cognitive phenomena such as [[illusory superiority]], in that it is a well observed fact that people rate themselves differently from how they rate others. In 2012, Stanley B. Klein published an article on the self and memory and how it relates to the self-reference effect. In recent years, studies on the self-reference effect have shifted from identifying mechanisms to using the self-reference as a research tool in understanding the nature of memory. Klein discusses words encoded with respect to oneself (the self-relevance effect) are recalled more often than words that are unrelated to the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klein |first1=Stanley B. |title=Self, Memory, and the Self-Reference Effect |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |date=2012 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=283–300 |doi=10.1177/1088868311434214|pmid=22291045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, regarding memory, people who showed higher altruism tend not to exhibit self-reference effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakao|first=Takashi|last2=Tokunaga|first2=Satoko|last3=Takamura|first3=Masahiro|last4=Nashiwa|first4=Hitomi|last5=Hayashi|first5=Shunsuke|last6=Miyatani|first6=Makoto|date=January 2012|title=Altruistic people show no self-reference effect in memory|journal=The Journal of General Psychology|volume=139|issue=1|pages=29–41|doi=10.1080/00221309.2011.642027|issn=1940-0888|pmid=24836719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated brain regions==

===Cortical mid-line structures===

In recent years,{{when|date=February 2018}} there has been an increase in [[cognitive neuroscience]] studies that focus on the concept of the [[self]]. These studies were developed in hopes of determining if there are certain brain regions that can account for the [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]] advantages involved in the self-reference effect. A great deal of research has been focused on several regions of the brain collectively identified as the cortical midline region. Brain imaging studies have raised the question of whether neural activity in cortical midline regions is self-specific. A [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] [[meta-analysis]] that included 87 studies, representing 1433 participants, was conducted to discuss these questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2011|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.05.028|pmid = 21609772|title = How is our self related to midline regions and the default-mode network?|journal = NeuroImage|volume = 57|issue = 3|pages =  1221–1233|last1 = Qin|first1 = Pengmin|last2 = Northoff|first2 = Georg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[analysis]] uncovered activity within several cortical midline structures in activities in which participants performed tasks involving the concept of self. Most studies that report such midline activations use tasks that are geared towards uncovering [[Biological neural network|neural processes]] that are related to social or psychological aspects of the self, such as self-referential judgments, [[Appraisal theory|self-appraisal]], and judgments of [[Personality trait|personality]] traits. Also, in addition to their perceived role in several forms of self-representation, cortical midline structures are also involved in the processing of [[social relationships]] and recognizing personally familiar others. Studies that show midline activations during understanding of social interactions between others or ascribing social traits to others ([[impression formation]]) typically require subjects to reference the [[Cognitive psychology|mental state]] of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2007|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2007.01.001|pmid = 17300981|title = The self and social cognition: The role of cortical midline structures and mirror neurons|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume = 11|issue = 4|pages = 153–157|last1 = Uddin|first1 = Lucina Q.|last2 = Iacoboni|first2 = Marco|last3 = Lange|first3 = Claudia|last4 = Keenan|first4 = Julian Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prefrontal cortex===

There are several areas within the cortical midline structure that are believed to be associated with the self-reference effect. One of the more active regions involved in the self-reference effect appears to be the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC). The [[prefrontal cortex]] (PFC) is the area of the brain that is believed to be involved in the planning of complex [[behavior]] and the expression and regulation of personality characteristics in social situations. The implication that the prefrontal cortex is involved in the regulation of unique internal personality characteristics illustrates how it may be an important component of the self-reference effect. The medial prefrontal cortex in both [[Brain hemisphere|hemispheres]] has been proposed as a site of the "self model" which is a theoretical construct made of essential features such as feelings of continuity and unity as well as [[Sense of agency|experience of agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.131.1.76|pmid = 15631554|title = Is Self Special? A Critical Review of Evidence from Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience|journal = Psychological Bulletin|volume = 131|issue = 1|pages = 76–97|year = 2005|last1 = Gillihan|first1 = Seth J.|last2 = Farah|first2 = Martha J.|citeseerx = 10.1.1.510.8989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the self-reference effect being linked to the medial prefrontal cortex stems from several experiments attempting to locate the [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] involved in the self-referencing process. Experiments in which participants were assigned tasks that required them to reflect on, or [[Introspection|introspect]] about their own mental states showed activity in the medial prefrontal cortex. For example, activity in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] has been observed in tasks in which participants report on their own personalities or preferences, adopt a first person perspective, or reflect on their current [[Affect (psychology)|affective state]]. Similar activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is displayed in cases where participants show the memory advantage that emerges when items are encoded in a self-relevant manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1162/0898929055002418|pmid = 16197685|title = The Link between Social Cognition and Self-referential Thought in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex|journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume = 17|issue = 8|pages = 1306–1315|year = 2005|last1 = Mitchell|first1 = Jason P.|last2 = Banaji|first2 = Mahzarin R.|last3 = MacRae|first3 = C. Neil|citeseerx = 10.1.1.650.7023}}&lt;/ref&gt; During various [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) tests conducted while participants were performing self-referential tasks, there was a consistent showing of increases in [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] (BOLD) signals in the ventral medial and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name=Sajonz2010&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2010|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.01.087|pmid = 20123026|title = Delineating self-referential processing from episodic memory retrieval: Common and dissociable networks|journal = NeuroImage|volume = 50|issue = 4|pages = 1606–1617|last1 = Sajonz|first1 = Bastian|last2 = Kahnt|first2 = Thorsten|last3 = Margulies|first3 = Daniel S.|last4 = Park|first4 = Soyoung Q.|last5 = Wittmann|first5 = André|last6 = Stoy|first6 = Meline|last7 = Ströhle|first7 = Andreas|last8 = Heinz|first8 = Andreas|last9 = Northoff|first9 = Georg|last10 = Bermpohl|first10 = Felix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Measuring BOLD signals is necessary for a sound interpretation of fMRI signals, as BOLD fMRI reflects a complex monitoring of changes in [[cerebral blood flow]], cerebral [[blood volume]] and [[Hemoglobin|blood oxygenation]].&lt;ref name="Logothetis2007"/&gt;

===Parietal lobe===

In addition to areas of the prefrontal cortex, research has suggested that there are areas within the [[parietal lobe]] that also play a role in activating the self-reference effect. During fMRI given during self-referential tasks there also appeared to be increases in BOLD signals within the [[Human anatomical terms|medial and lateral]] parietal cortex&lt;ref name=Sajonz2010/&gt; To further determine whether or not the medial parietal lobe plays a role in self-referencing, participants were subjected to [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] over the region. Stimulation over this region produced a decrease in the ability of participants to [[Knowledge retrieval|retrieve]] previous judgments of mental self when compared to the retrieval of judgment of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2006|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.12.002|pmid = 16466680|title = Self-referential processing in our brain—A meta-analysis of imaging studies on the self|journal = NeuroImage|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 440–457|last1 = Northoff|first1 = Georg|last2 = Heinzel|first2 = Alexander|last3 = De Greck|first3 = Moritz|last4 = Bermpohl|first4 = Felix|last5 = Dobrowolny|first5 = Henrik|last6 = Panksepp|first6 = Jaak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development over the lifespan==

===Childhood===

The development of a sense of self and the understanding that one is separate and uniquely different from others is vital in the development of the self-reference effect advantage. As young children grow, their sense of self and understanding of the world around them is continuously increasing. Although this occurs at different stages for each child, research has shown rather early development of the self-reference advantage. Research focusing on the [[Recall (memory)|recall]] abilities of children have shown the self-referencing advantage in children as young as five years old.&lt;ref name=Sui2005&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1080/01650250500172673|title = Five-Year-Olds Can Show the Self-Reference Advantage|journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development|volume = 29|issue = 5|pages = 382–387|year = 2005|last1 = Sui|first1 = Jie|last2 = Zhu|first2 = Ying}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language development appears to play a significant role in the development and use of the self-reference effect. [[Labelling|Verbal labeling]] is among the first strategic behaviors shown by young children in order to enhance memory, and as children progress in age and language development, their performance on memory tasks involving self-referencing increases.&lt;ref name=Sui2005/&gt; A study done in 2011 on preschoolers found that observations on children as young as three years old suggests that the self-reference effect is apparent in event memory, by their ability to self-recognize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ross |first1=Josephine |last2=Anderson |first2=James R. |last3=Campbell |first3=Robin N. |title=I remember me: Implications, limitations, and applications |journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development |date=2011 |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=68–79 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5834.2011.00618.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adulthood===

Like children, the continuous development of a self-concept is related to the development of self-referencing in individuals. The relationships formed with intimate others over the lifespan appear to have an effect on self-referencing in relation to memory. The extent to which we include others in our self-concept has been a topic of particular interest for social psychologists. Theories of intimacy and personal relationships might suggest that the self-reference effect is affected by the closeness of a relationship with the other used as a target. Some researchers define closeness as an extension of self into other and suggest that one's cognitive processes about a close other develop in a way so as to include that person as part of the self. Consistent with this idea, it has been demonstrated that the memorial advantage afforded to self-referenced material can be diminished or eliminated when the comparison target is an intimate other such as a parent, friend, or spouse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1093/scan/nsl001|pmid = 18985097|pmc = 2555408|title = Medial prefrontal activity differentiates self from close others|journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume = 1|issue = 1|pages = 18–25|year = 2006|last1 = Heatherton|first1 = Todd F.|last2 = Wyland|first2 = Carrie L.|last3 = MacRae|first3 = C. Neil|last4 = Demos|first4 = Kathryn E.|last5 = Denny|first5 = Bryan T.|last6 = Kelley|first6 = William M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity for utilizing the self-reference effect remains relatively high throughout the lifespan, even well into old age. Normally functioning older adults can benefit from self-referencing. Ageing is marked by cognitive impairments in a number of domains including [[long-term memory]], but [[older adults]]' memory performance is malleable. Memory strategies and orientations that engage "deep" encoding processes benefit older adults. For example, older adults exhibit increased recall when using self-generated strategies that rely on personally relevant information (e.g., important birthdates) relative to other [[Mnemonic|mnemonic strategies]] However, research has shown that there are some differences between older adults and younger adults use of the self-reference advantage. Like young adults, older adults exhibit superior recognition for self-referenced items. But the amount of cognitive resources an individual has influence on how much older adults benefit from self referencing. Self-referencing improves older adult's memory, but its benefits are restricted regardless of the social and personally relevant nature of the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1080/09658210701701394|pmid = 18033620|title = Ageing and the self-reference effect in memory|journal = Memory|volume = 15|issue = 8|pages = 822–837|year = 2007|last1 = Gutchess|first1 = Angela H.|last2 = Kensinger|first2 = Elizabeth A.|last3 = Yoon|first3 = Carolyn|last4 = Schacter|first4 = Daniel L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A reason for this change in self referencing may be the change in brain activation that has been observed in older adults when studying self-referencing. Older adults showed more activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and along the [[cingulate gyrus]] than young adults. Because these regions often are associated with self-referential processing, these results suggest that older adults' mnemonic boost for positive information may stem from an increased tendency to process this information in relation to themselves. It has been proposed that this "positivity shift" may occur because older adults put more emphasis on emotion regulation goals than do young adults, with older adults having a greater motivation to derive emotional meaning from life and to maintain positive affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2008|doi = 10.1162/jocn.2008.20080|pmid = 18284340|title = Neural Processes Supporting Young and Older Adults' Emotional Memories|journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume = 20|issue = 7|pages = 1161–1173|last1 = Kensinger|first1 = Elizabeth A.|last2 = Schacter|first2 = Daniel L.|citeseerx = 10.1.1.537.3525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect on students ==
Students are often challenged when faced with the attempt to recall memories.  It is therefore import to understand the effects of self-reference encoding for students and beneficial ways it can increase their recall of information. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of, self-referent encoding.

Rogers, Kuiper, and Kirker (1977) performed one of the first studies examining the self-reference effect making it a foundational article.  The focus of the study was to identify the importance of the self and how it is implicated when processing personal information.  The self-reference effect has been considered a robust encoding strategy and has been effective over the past 30 years (Gutches et al., 2007).  The process behind this study was to gather students and divide them into four different task groups and they would be asked to give a yes or no answer to a trait adjective being presented to them.  The four tasks that were used were: structural, phonemic, semantic, and self-reference.  There were some different theories that support the study.  The personality theory stressed that the observer's network when looking at the trait adjectives is an essential part of how they process personal information Hastorf et al. (1970).  Another theory that supports this study is the attribution theory. It is another example where a person's organization traits fit with the self-reference effect Jones et al. (1971). The self is visualized as a schema that is involved with processing personal information, interpretation, and memories which is considered a powerful and effective process (Rogers et al., 1977).

Gutchess, Kensinger, and Schacter (2007) performed a study where they used age as a factor when looking at the self-reference effect.  The first and second experiment looks at the young and older adults and they are presented with encoded adjectives and they must decide if it describes them.  The third experiment is deciding if they found these traits desirable towards themselves.  The age difference was shown effective with the self-reference effect leaving the older adults showing superiority of recognition for self-referenced items that were relative.  Although, self-referencing the older adults did not have the same restoring level as the younger adults.  A major factor that played in this study was the availability of cognitive resources. When there was a greater availability of cognitive resources, the ability to enhance memory similarly for both young and older adults diverged from socioemotional processing (Gutches et al., 2007).

Hartlep and Forsyth (2001) performed a study using two different approaches when studying for an exam.  The first approach was the survey, question, read, reflect, recite, and review method which is called the SQR4.  The other method was the self-reference method.  The third group was a controlled group and received no special instructions on their studying process (Hartlep &amp; Forsyth, 2001).  This study is considered an applied study.  People who have a more elaborative cognitive framework, the better they will be able to retrieve a memory.  The most elaborative cognitive framework someone can have is knowledge of themselves (Hartlep &amp; Forsyth, 2001).  The self-reference effect is viable when having strict lab conditions. When students are studying, if they can see the material as an elaboration of what they already remember or can relate to personal experiences, their recall would be enhanced (Hartlep &amp; Forsyth, 2001). Although, the self-reference method can enhance recall of memory in certain instances, unfortunately for this study, there were no significant differences between the two study methods.

Serbun, Shih and Gutchess (2011) performed a study involving the effects of general and specific memory when using the self-reference effect. The study created a gap in research due to the experiments being tested.  The first experiment uses visuals details of objects where the second and third experiment use verbal memory to assess the self-reference effect.  The self-reference effect enhances both general and specific memory and can improve the accuracy and richness of a memory (Serbun et al., 2011).  We know how the self-reference effect works, but instead of using trait adjectives to assess recall, we are looking at trait adjectives.  The results from the experiments show that self-referencing does not function only through the increase in familiarity or general memory for the object, but enhances memory for details of an event.  This likely draws on more recollected processes. This information supports that self-referencing is effective of encoding a rich, detailed memory towards not only general memory, but specific memories.

(Nakao et al., 2012) performed a study to show the relation between the self-reference effect and people that are highly in altruism and low in altruism.  This all starts with the medical prefrontal cortex (MPFC).  People who are high in altruism did not show the self-reference effect compared to the participants low in altruism.  The participants who frequently chose the altruistic behavior refer to the social desirability as a backboard (Nakoa et al., 2012).  The relation the self-reference effect and altruism is the MPFC.  When using the self-reference effect, people who are low in altruism, the same part of the brain is being used.  Whereas the same is for people who are high in altruism when using social desirability. Social desirability ties into the different types of memory enhancement can vary for individual differences of past experiences. People's individual differences can show similar effects as the self-reference effect (Nakoa et al., 2012).

The self-reference effect is a rich and powerful encoding process that can be used multiple ways.  The self-reference effect shows better results over the semantic method when processing personal information.  Processing personal information can be distinguished and recalled differently with age.  The older the subject, the more rich and vivid the memory can be due to the amount of information the brain has processed.  The self-reference just as effective as the SQR4 method when study for exams, but the self-reference method is preferred.  Defining general and specific memories using objects, verbal cues, etc. can be effective when using the self-reference effect.  When using these different method, the same part of the brain is being active resulting in relation and better recall. It was expected that participants would recall the most number of words from the self-referent list rather than from the semantic or structural lists and more words from the semantic list than from the structural list.  It was also expected that for the words encoded in the self-referent condition, fewer words would be recalled by participants in the high altruism group than in the low altruism group.

'''Structural information theory''' ('''SIT''') is a theory about [[perception|human perception]] and in particular about visual perceptual organization, which is the neuro-cognitive process that enables us to perceive scenes as structured wholes consisting of objects arranged in space. It has been applied to a wide range of research topics,&lt;ref&gt;Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. &amp; van der Helm, P. A. (2013). ''Structural information theory: The simplicity of visual form''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in visual form perception but also in, for instance, visual ergonomics, [[data visualization]], and [[music perception]].

SIT began as a quantitative model of visual [[pattern classification]]. Nowadays, it includes quantitative models of [[symmetry|symmetry perception]] and [[amodal perception|amodal completion]], and is theoretically sustained by a perceptually adequate formalization of visual regularity, a quantitative account of viewpoint dependencies, and a powerful form of neurocomputation.&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A. (2014). ''Simplicity in vision: A multidisciplinary account of perceptual organization''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; SIT has been argued to be the best defined and most successful extension of [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt ideas]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S. E. (1999).  ''Vision science: Photons to phenomenology.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only Gestalt approach providing a [[calculus|formal calculus]] that generates plausible [[percept|perceptual interpretations]].

== The simplicity principle ==

Although visual stimuli are fundamentally multi-interpretable, the human visual system usually has a clear preference for only one interpretation. To explain this preference, SIT introduced a formal coding model starting from the assumption that the perceptually preferred interpretation of a stimulus is the one with the [[simplicity|simplest code]]. A simplest code is a code with minimum information load, that is, a code that enables a reconstruction of the stimulus using a minimum number of descriptive parameters. Such a code is obtained by capturing a maximum amount of visual regularity and yields a hierarchical organization of the stimulus in terms of wholes and parts.

The assumption that the visual system prefers simplest interpretations is called the simplicity principle.&lt;ref&gt;Hochberg, J. E., &amp; McAlister, E. (1953). A quantitative approach to figural "goodness". ''Journal of Experimental Psychology, 46,'' 361—364.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the simplicity principle is an information-theoretical translation of the Gestalt law of Prägnanz,&lt;ref&gt;Koffka, K. (1935). ''Principles of gestalt psychology.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; which was inspired by the natural tendency of physical systems to settle into relatively stable states defined by a minimum of free-energy. Furthermore, just as the later-proposed [[Minimum description length|minimum description length principle]] in [[algorithmic information theory]] (AIT), a.k.a. the theory of [[Kolmogorov complexity]], it can be seen as a formalization of [[Occam's Razor]], according to which the simplest interpretation of data is the best one.

== Structural versus algorithmic information theory ==

Since the 1960s, SIT (in psychology) and AIT (in computer science) evolved independently as viable alternatives for [[Claude Shannon|Shannon's]] classical [[information theory]] which had been developed in communication theory.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, C. E. (1948). A mathematical theory of communication. ''Bell System Technical Journal, 27,'' 379-423, 623—656.&lt;/ref&gt; In Shannon's approach, things are assigned codes with lengths based on their probability in terms of frequencies of occurrence (as, e.g., in the [[Morse code]]). However, in many domains, including perception, such probabilities are hardly quantifiable, if at all. Both SIT and AIT circumvent this problem by turning to descriptive complexities of individual things.

Although SIT and AIT share many starting points and objectives, there are also several relevant differences:
* SIT makes the perceptually relevant distinction between structural and metrical information, whereas AIT does not.
* SIT encodes for a restricted set of perceptually relevant kinds of regularities, whereas AIT encodes for any imaginable regularity.
* In SIT, the relevant outcome of an encoding is a hierarchical organization, whereas in AIT, it is only a complexity value.

== Simplicity versus likelihood ==

In visual perception research, the simplicity principle contrasts with the [[Helmholtz]]ian likelihood principle,&lt;ref&gt;von Helmholtz, H. L. F. (1962). ''Treatise on Physiological Optics'' (J. P. C. Southall, Trans.). New York: Dover. (Original work published 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; which assumes that the preferred interpretation of a stimulus is the one most likely to be true in this world. As shown within a [[Bayes theorem|Bayesian framework]] and using AIT findings, the simplicity principle would imply that perceptual interpretations are fairly veridical (i.e., truthful) in many worlds rather than, as assumed by the likelihood principle, highly veridical in only one world.&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A. (2000). Simplicity versus likelihood in visual perception: From surprisals to precisals. ''Psychological Bulletin, 126,'' 770—800. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0033-2909.126.5.770 doi:10.1037//0033-2909.126.5.770].&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, whereas the likelihood principle suggests that the visual system is a special-purpose system (i.e., adapted to one specific world), the simplicity principle suggests that it is a general-purpose system (i.e., adaptive to many different worlds).

Crucial to the latter finding is the distinction between, and integration of, viewpoint-independent and viewpoint-dependent factors in vision, as proposed in SIT's empirically successful model of amodal completion.&lt;ref&gt;van Lier, R. J., van der Helm, P. A., &amp; Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1994). Integrating global and local aspects of visual occlusion. ''Perception, 23,'' 883—903. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1068/p230883 doi:10.1068/p230883].&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bayesian framework, these factors correspond to prior probabilities and conditional probabilities, respectively. In SIT's model, however, both factors are quantified in terms of complexities, that is, complexities of objects and of their spatial relationships, respectively. This approach is consistent with [[cognitive neuroscience|neuroscientific]] ideas about the distinction and interaction between the ventral ("what") and dorsal ("where") streams in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Ungerleider, L. G., &amp; Mishkin, M. (1982). Two cortical visual systems. In D. J. Ingle, M. A. Goodale, &amp; R. J. W. Mansfield (Eds.), ''Analysis of Visual Behavior'' (pp. 549—586). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versus connectionism and dynamic systems theory ==

A representational theory like SIT seems opposite to [[dynamic systems theory]] (DST), while [[connectionism]] can be seen as something in between. That is, connectionism flirts with DST when it comes to the usage of [[differential equations]] and flirts with theories like SIT when it comes to the representation of information. In fact, the different operating bases of SIT, connectionism, and DST, correspond to what [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|Marr]] called the computational, the algorithmic, and the implementational levels of description, respectively. According to Marr, these levels of description are complementary rather than opposite, thus reflecting [[epistemological pluralism]].

What SIT, connectionism, and DST have in common is that they describe nonlinear system behavior, that is, a minor change in the input may yield a major change in the output. Their complementarity expresses itself in that they focus on different aspects:
* Whereas DST focuses primarily on how the state of a physical system as a whole (in this case, the [[brain]]) develops over time, both SIT and connectionism focus primarily on what a system does in terms of information processing (which, in this case, can be said to constitute [[Cognitive science|cognition]]) and both assume that this information processing relies on interactions between pieces of information in distributed representations, that is, in networks of connected pieces of information.
* Whereas connectionism focuses on concrete interaction mechanisms (i.c., activation spreading) in a prefixed network that is assumed to be suited for many inputs, SIT focuses on the nature of the outcome of interactions that are assumed to take place in transient, input-dependent, networks.

== Modeling principles ==

In SIT's formal coding model, candidate interpretations of a stimulus are represented by [[String (computer science)|symbol strings]], in which identical symbols refer to identical perceptual primitives (e.g., blobs or edges). Every substring of such a string represents a spatially contiguous part of an interpretation, so that the entire string can be read as a reconstruction recipe for the interpretation and, thereby, for the stimulus. These strings then are encoded (i.e., they are searched for visual regularities) to find the interpretation with the simplest code.

This encoding is performed by way of symbol manipulation, which, in psychology, has led to critical statements of the sort of "SIT assumes that the brain performs symbol manipulation". Such statements, however, fall in the same category as statements such as "physics assumes that nature applies formulas such as [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] ''E=mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] ''F=ma''" and "DST models assume that dynamic systems apply differential equations". That is, these statements ignore that the very concept of [[formal system|formalization]] means that potentially relevant things are represented by symbols—not as a goal in itself but as a means to capture potentially relevant relationships between these things.

== Visual regularity ==

To obtain simplest codes, SIT applies coding rules that capture the kinds of regularity called iteration, symmetry, and alternation. These have been shown to be the only regularities that satisfy the formal criteria of
(a) being holographic regularities that (b) allow for hierarchically transparent codes.&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A., &amp; Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1991). Accessibility, a criterion for regularity and hierarchy in visual pattern codes. ''Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 35,'' 151—213. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-2496%2891%2990025-O doi:10.1016/0022-2496%2891%2990025-O].&lt;/ref&gt;

A crucial difference with respect to the traditionally considered transformational formalization of visual regularity is that, holographically, mirror symmetry is composed of many relationships between symmetry pairs rather than one relationship between symmetry halves. Whereas the transformational characterization may be suited better for [[object recognition]], the holographic characterization seems more consistent with the buildup of mental representations in object perception.

The perceptual relevance of the criteria of holography and transparency has been verified in the holographic approach to visual regularity.&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A., &amp; Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1996). Goodness of visual regularities: A nontransformational approach. ''Psychological Review, 103,'' 429—456. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.429 doi:10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.429].&lt;/ref&gt; This approach provides an empirically successful model of the detectability of single and combined visual regularities, whether or not perturbed by noise. For instance, it explains that mirror symmetries and Glass pattens are about equally detectable and usually better detectable than repetitions. It also explains that the detectability of mirror symmetries and Glass pattens in the presence of noise follows a psychophysical law that improves on [[Weber–Fechner law|Weber's law]].&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A. (2010). Weber-Fechner behaviour in symmetry perception? ''Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics, 72'', 1854—1864.

[[Image:Sapta Chakra, 1899.jpg|220px|thumb|right|The subtle body in Indian mysticism, from a [[Yoga]] manuscript in Braj Bhasa language, 1899, now in the British Library.]]

A '''subtle body''' is one of a series of psycho-spiritual constituents of living beings, according to various [[esotericism|esoteric]], [[occultism|occult]], and [[mysticism|mystical]] teachings. According to such beliefs each subtle body corresponds to a subtle [[plane of existence]], in a [[hierarchy]] or [[great chain of being]] that culminates in the physical form.

According to ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', one of the most sacred texts of [[Hinduism]], the subtle body is composed of mind, intelligence and ego, which controls the gross physical body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/13/6-7|title=Bg 13.6-7|first=|last=pnd|date=15 July 2011|website=www.vedabase.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503130040/http://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/13/6-7|archivedate=3 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known in other different spiritual traditions: "the most sacred body" (''wujud al-aqdas'') and "true and genuine body" (''jism asli haqiqi'') in [[Sufism]], "the diamond body" in [[Taoism]] and [[Vajrayana]], "the light body" or "[[rainbow body]]" in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], "the body of bliss" in [[Kriya Yoga]], and "the immortal body" (''soma athanaton'') in [[Hermeticism]].&lt;ref&gt;White.&lt;/ref&gt; The various attributes of the subtle body are frequently described in terms of often obscure [[symbol]]ism: Tantra features references to the sun and moon as well as various Indian rivers and deities, while Taoist alchemy speaks of [[dantian|cauldrons]] and cinnabar fields.

==History of the term==
The expression "subtile body" appears suddenly in English literature in about 1650, appears erratically until it ceased to be used by about 1840.  At that time, the more common term "subtle body" comes into use.  The latter expression gradually gains in currency through the nineteenth century, and begins a sharp increase in usage from about 1940 until the present time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Google N-Gram|title=N-Gram Analysis, "subtile body, subtle body"|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=subtile+body%2Csubtle+body&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1500&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Csubtile%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bsubtile%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bsubtile%20Body%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Csubtle%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bsubtle%20body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bsubtle%20Body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BSubtle%20Body%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BSubtle%20body%3B%2Cc0|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research is needed to clarify the actual authors who used the phrase, and what they meant by it.  But the word may have a connection with the Sanskrit Sūkṣma (subtle, unmanifest, dormant) Śarīra (body) which is described in the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta)#Suksma sarira - subtle body]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asian religions==
[[Image:Acupuncture chart 300px.jpg|thumb|200px|''Drawing showing the circulation of Qi energy, Ming Dynasty'']]

The [[Yoga|Yogic]], [[tantra|Tantric]] and other systems of [[Hinduism]], [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]], as well as Chinese [[Taoist alchemy]] contain theories of subtle physiology having a number of focal points ([[chakra]]s, [[acupuncture points]]) connected by a series of channels ([[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]], [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]]) that convey subtle breath ([[prana]], vayu, [[Qi|ch'i, ki]], [[lung (Tibetan Buddhism)|lung]]).

These invisible channels and points are understood to determine the characteristics of the visible physical form. By understanding and mastering the subtlest levels of reality one gains mastery over the physical realm. Through practice of various breathing and visualization exercises one is able to manipulate and direct the flow of vital force, to achieve supernormal powers ''(''[[Sanskrit]]: ''[[siddhi]]s)'' and attain higher [[Altered state of consciousness|states of consciousness]], [[immortality]], or [[Moksha|liberation]].

=== Hinduism ===
[[File:SahajaSubtleSystem.svg|thumb|An illustration of a subtle body system of seven chakras commonly adopted by contemporary yoga.]]
Early mentions of subtle body ([[Sanskrit]]: ''sūkṣma śarīra'') concepts appear in the Upanishads, particularly the earliest known theory appears in the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]]'s (circa 4th or 5th centuries BCE) theory of five bodies or selves.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The Taittiriya differentiates between five increasingly subtle body/selves: &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* The ''anna-maya'' ("food body", physical body/self), 
* The ''prana-maya'' (body made of vital breath or [[prana]]), 
* The ''mano-maya'' (body made of mind), 
* The ''[[Vijñāna|vijñana]]-maya'' (body made of consciousness)
* The ''ananda-maya'' (bliss body). 
The Taittiriya also contains passages which suggests a theory of a subtle internal anatomy which includes the concept of a central channel ([[Nadi (yoga)|nadi]]).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In later Vedic texts called [[Samhita|samhitas]] and [[Brahmana|brahmanas]] one also finds a theory of five "winds" or "breaths" (''vayus, [[Prana|pranas]]''):&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Prāṇa'', associated with inhalation
* ''Apāna'', associated with exhalation
* ''Uḍāna'', associated with distribution of breath within the body
* ''Samāna'', associated with digestion
* ''Vyāna'', associated with excretion of waste
A millennium later, these concepts were adapted and refined by various spiritual traditions. The similar concept of the {{IAST|Liṅga Śarīra}} is seen as the vehicle of consciousness in later [[Samkhya]], [[Vedanta]], and [[Yoga]], and is propelled by past-life tendencies, or ''[[bhava]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gerald. ''Classical Samkhya'' p.242&lt;/ref&gt; Linga can be translated as "characteristic mark" or "impermanence" and the term [[Sarira (Vedanta)]] as "form" or "mold".&lt;ref&gt;Purucker, Gottfried. ''The Occult Glossary''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karana'' or "instrument" is a synonymous term. In the Classical Samkhya system of [[Isvarakrsna]] (ca. 4th century CE), the ''Lińga'' is the characteristic mark of the transmigrating entity. It consists of twenty-five [[tattva]]s from eternal consciousness down to the five organs of sense, five of activity (''buddindriya'' or ''jñānendriya'', and  ''karmendriya'' respectively) and the five subtle elements that are the objects of sense (''tanmatras'') The ''Samkhyakarika'' says:{{quote|The subtle body (''linga''), previously arisen, unconfined, constant, inclusive of the great one (''mahat'') etc , through the subtle elements, not having enjoyment, transmigrates, (because of) being endowed with ''bhavas'' ("conditions" or "dispositions").

As a picture (does) not (exist) without a support, or as a shadow (does) not (exist) without a post and so forth; so too the instrument (''linga'' or ''karana'') does not exist without that which is specific (i.e. a subtle body).&lt;ref&gt;Samkhyakarika, transl. Gerald Larson, vv 60-81, ''Classical Samkhya'' p.268.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The classical [[Vedanta]] tradition developed the theory of the five bodies into the theory of the [[Kosha|koshas]] "sheaths" or "coverings" which surround and obscure the self ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]). In classical Vedanta these are seen as obstacles to realization and traditions like Shankara's [[Advaita Vedanta]] had little interest in working with the subtle body.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 34, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tantra]] traditions meanwhile ([[Shaivism|Shaiva]] [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] and Buddhist yoga), the subtle body was seen in a more positive light, offering potential for yogic practices which could lead to liberation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Tantric traditions contain the most complex theories of the subtle body, with sophisticated descriptions of energy [[Nadi (yoga)|nadis]] (literally "stream or river", channels through which ''vayu'' and ''prana'' flows) and [[chakra]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (lit. "circles") which are points of focus where nadis meet.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; The main channels, shared by both Hindu and Buddhist systems, are the central (in Hindu systems: ''susumna''; in Buddhist: ''avadhuti''), left and right (in Hindu systems: ''ida'' and ''pingala''; Buddhist: ''lalana'' and ''rasana'').&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Further subsidiary channels are said to radiate outwards from the chakras, where the main channels meet. There are various chakra systems depending on the [[tantra]]; the ''Netra tantra'' describes six chakras, the ''Kaulajñana-nirnay''a describes eight, and the ''Kubjikamata Tantra'' describes seven (the most widely known set of chakras).&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Indian subtle body terminology was adopted by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] of [[Madame Blavatsky]].

The modern Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that the subtle body "is the vehicle of desires and vital forces,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''2'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 145. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He held that the subtle body is one of three bodies with which the soul must cease to identify in order to realize God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''2'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 144. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[Image:Chakras and energy channels 2 (3749594497).jpg|thumb|200px|A Tibetan illustration of the subtle body showing the central channel and two side channels as well as five chakras.]]

In [[Buddhist Tantra]], the subtle body is termed the ‘innate body’
(''nija-deha'') or the ‘uncommon means body’ (''asadhdrana-upayadeha'').&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Wayman, Alex; Yoga of the Guhyasamajatantra: The arcane lore of forty verses : a Buddhist Tantra commentary, 1977, page 65.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called ''sūkṣma śarīra'', rendered in Tibetan as ''traway-lu'' (transliterated ''phra ba’i lus''). &lt;ref&gt;Lama Willa B Miller. Reviews: Investigating the Subtle Body. {{cite web |url=https://www.lionsroar.com/reviews-investigating-the-subtle-body/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-03-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319151239/https://www.lionsroar.com/reviews-investigating-the-subtle-body/ |archivedate=19 March 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The subtle body consists of thousands of subtle energy channels ([[nadis]]), which are conduits for energies or "winds" ([[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)|lung]] or [[prana]]) and converge at [[chakras]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  
According to Dagsay Tulku Rinpoche, there are three mains channels (''nadis''), central, left and right; "their beginning point is located between a person's eyebrows. From there, they run upward to the crown chakra. The passage then parallels the spine, running through all seven chakras - the centers of subtle energy - and ending about two inches below the belly button."&lt;ref&gt;Dagsay Tulku Rinpoche, The Practice of Tibetan Meditation: Exercises, Visualizations, and Mantras for Health and Well-being. Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co, 2002, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; 

Buddhist tantras generally describe four or five chakras in the shape of a lotus with varying petals. For example, the [[Hevajra Tantra]] (8th century) states:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Center [i.e. cakra] of Creation [at the sexual organ] a sixty-four petal lotus. In the Center of Essential Nature [at the heart] an eight petal lotus. In the Center of Enjoyment [at the throat] a sixteen petal lotus. In the Center of Great Bliss [at the top of the head] a thirty-two petal lotus.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In contrast, the historically later [[Kalachakra|Kalachakra tantra]] describes six chakras.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, liberation is achieved through subtle body processes during [[Deity yoga|Completion Stage]] practices such as the [[Six Yogas of Naropa|Six yogas of Naropa]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel, Jay Johnston (editors). Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body, Routledge,  2013, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Western esotericism ==
=== Theosophy ===

[[H. P. Blavatsky]]'s [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] teaching represented the convergence of 19th century Western occultism, Eastern philosophy, religion, science, and mysticism. ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', and ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'' combined the [[vedanta|Vedantic]] concept of five [[kosha]]s with Western esoteric traditions (particularly [[Neoplatonism]]).  She refers to three subtle bodies:

* ''[[Linga sarira|Linga Sharira]]'' - the Double or [[Astral body]]
* ''Mayavi-rupa'' - the "Illusion-body"
* ''Causal Body'' - the vehicle of the higher Mind

The ''Linga Sharira'' is the invisible double of the human body, elsewhere referred to as the [[etheric body]], [[doppelgänger]] or bioplasmic body and serves as a model or matrix of the physical body, which conforms to the shape, appearance and condition of his "double". The linga sarira can be separated or projected a limited distance from the body. When separated from the body it can be wounded by sharp objects. When it returns to the physical frame, the wound will be reflected in the physical counterpart, a phenomenon called "repercussion". At death, it is discarded together with the physical body and eventually disintegrates or decomposes.

The mayavi-rupa is dual in its functions, being:
"the vehicle both of thought and of the animal passions and desires, drawing at one and the same time from the lowest terrestrial manas (mind) and Kama, the element of desire".&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Blavatsky, "Astral Bodies, or Doppelgangers". ''Collected Writings'' X, pp. 217–220&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher part of this body, containing the spiritual elements gathered during life, merges after death entirely into the causal body; while the lower part, containing the animal elements, forms the Kama-rupa, the source of "spooks" or [[ghost|apparitions]] of the dead.

[[File:First Principles of Thesophy 066.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Vehicles of the Soul according to the Theosophist [[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa]].]]

[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] was further systematized in the writings of [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant]]. For example, they divided Blavatsky's dual mayavi-rupa into two different bodies: the emotional and the mental bodies.  They also redefined some terms. The Linga Sarira (sometimes called astral body by Blavatsky) was denominated by [[Annie Besant]]&lt;ref&gt;Annie Besant, ''The Ancient Wisdom'', 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Etheric body|Etheric double]]. [[C.W. Leadbeater]], regarding the emotional body as the seat of the [[Kama (Theosophy)|kamic]] principle of Blavatsky's constitution, denominated it [[astral body]]. Therefore, the subtle bodies in a human being are:

* [[Etheric body]] (vehicle of [[prana]])
* [[Astral body|Emotional or astral body]] (vehicle of desires and emotions)
* [[Mental body]] (vehicle of the concrete or lower mind)
* [[Causal body]] (vehicle of the abstract or higher mind)

Each "body" has its own [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] and set of [[chakra]]s, and corresponds to a particular [[Plane (cosmology)|plane of existence]].

[[Image:Cosmicman.jpg|thumb|116px|left|The Subtle body and the cosmic man, Nepal 1600s]]

=== Post-theosophists ===

The later Theosophical arrangement was taken up by [[Alice Bailey]], and from there found its way (with variations) into the New Age worldview. It is also associated with the human [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] observed through [[Kirlian photography]] and [[Walter John Kilner|Kilner screens]]. The [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophical view of the human being]] found in [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s [[Anthroposophical]] teachings usually referred to only the Etheric and Astral Bodies. However, Steiner also used a threefold classification of body, soul, and spirit as well as a sevenfold and a ninefold description.

[[Max Heindel]] divided the subtle body into: [[Etheric body|Vital Body]] made of Ether, our instrument for specializing the vital energy of the sun, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about an inch and a half outside the body; the [[Desire body]], which is our emotional nature and pervades both the vital and dense bodies, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about 16&amp;nbsp;inches outside our visible body, related to the [[Astral plane|Desire World]]; and the [[Mental body]], which functions like a mirror, reflects the outer world and enables the Ego to transmit its commands as thought, word and action. The human being is seen as a threefold Spirit, possessing a Mind by which he governs the threefold Body that he transmutes into a threefold [[Soul]]. The Human Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the desire body to be transmuted into the Emotional Soul; the Life Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the vital body to be transmuted into the Intellectual Soul; the Divine Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the dense body to be transmuted into the Conscious Soul.

[[Samael Aun Weor]] wrote extensively on the subtle vehicles, organizing them in accordance with the [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. The common person only contains the lunar vehicles of emotion ([[astral body]]), thought ([[mental body]]), and will ([[causal body]]), concentrations of the collective animalistic intelligence, the evolution of the Essence through the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms. Becoming human means to have a soul, a Solar Astral Body, Solar Mental Body and Solar Causal Body. These bodies are constructed through a form of [[Tantra]] called [[White tantrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=Types of Spiritual Schools |url=http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/417/64/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531203308/http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/417/64/ |archivedate=31 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Note: The "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012401/http://www.gnosticteachings.org/component/option,com_glossary/func,view/Itemid,10077/catid,101/term,Ego/ ego]" referred to by Samael Aun Weor is not used in the same context as it is used other esoteric schools.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Brennan]]'s account of the subtle bodies in her books ''Hands of Light'' and ''Light Emerging'' refers to the subtle bodies as "layers" in the "Human Energy Field" or aura. Causality proceeds downwards: each of the layers has its own characteristics and can have its own expression of disease, requiring individual healing. As with the Adyar arrangement, each body or aura also has its own complement of chakras, which interrelate to those in the other layers.

Michal Levin describes the relationship between the energy bodies and the chakras in her book Meditation, Path to the Deepest Self.

=== Fourth Way ===

An interesting variant on the concept of subtle bodies is found in both Alchemical Taoism and the "[[Fourth Way]]" teachings of [[Gurdjieff]] and [[Ouspensky]], where it is said that one can create a subtle body, and hence achieve post-mortem immortality, through spiritual or yogic exercises. The "soul" then is not something one is born with, but something that one has to develop through esoteric practice.

According to (Rosenthal, 1997) "In Gurdjieff's cosmology our nature is tripartite and is composed of the physical (planetary), emotional (astral) and mental (spiritual) bodies; in each person one of these three bodies ultimately achieves dominance." The Fourth way as taught by [[Gurdjieff]] and [[Ouspensky]] is a philosophy of developing the divine body which is gained when one has complete understanding and self perfection. The ultimate task of the fourth way teachings is to harmoniously develop the four bodies into a single way.&lt;ref&gt;Bernice Glatzer Rosenthal ''The occult in Russian and Soviet culture'' 1997, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aleister Crowley and the Body of Light ==

The work of the ''Body of Light'' was part of English author and [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]]'s system of [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]], saying in his ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'' that it must be developed by rigid discipline, including rituals and the "assumption of god-forms", as well as by practice and experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley]] ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'', [[Samuel Weiser]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From Crowley's ''[[Magick Without Tears]]'' (Ch. 81):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''One passes through the veil of the exterior world (which, as in Yoga, but in another sense, becomes "unreal" by comparison as one passes beyond) one creates a subtle body (instrument is a better term) called the body of Light; this one develops and controls; it gains new powers as one progresses, usually by means of what is called "initiation:" finally, one carries on almost one's whole life in this Body of Light, and achieves in its own way the mastery of the Universe.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over the course of five days, Jones ­– a member of the [[Students_for_a_Democratic_Society|SDS]]&lt;ref name="catamount_12_6"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, Cubberley United Student Movement sponsor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Lesson Plan, the story of The Third Wave" |url = http://www.lessonplanmovie.com/|access-date = 2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Black_Panther_Party|Black Panthers]] supporter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Catamount: "Society is Sterile" -- R.

As the movement grew outside his class and began to number in the hundreds, Jones began to feel that the movement had spiraled out of control. He convinced the students to attend a rally where he claimed the announcement of a Third Wave presidential candidate would be televised. Upon their arrival, the students were presented with a blank channel. Jones told his students of the true nature of the movement as an experiment in fascism, and presented to them a short film discussing the actions of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Jones_essay"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/Auxiliary/Psychology/Frank/Thirdwave.html |dead-url=yes |title=The Third Wave

==Background to the Third Wave experiment==
The experiment took place at [[Cubberley High School]] in [[Palo Alto]], [[California]], during the first week of April 1967.{{ref|timing}} Jones, finding himself unable to explain to his students how the German population could have claimed ignorance of [[The Holocaust]], decided to demonstrate it to them instead.&lt;ref name="Jones_essay" /&gt; Jones started a movement called "The Third Wave" and told his students that the movement aimed to eliminate democracy.&lt;ref name="catamount_11_14" /&gt; The idea that democracy emphasizes individuality was considered as a drawback of democracy, and Jones emphasized this main point of the movement in its motto: "Strength through discipline, strength through community, strength through action, strength through pride."&lt;ref name="catamount_11_14" /&gt;

The experiment was not well documented at the time. Of contemporary sources, the experiment is only mentioned in the Cubberley High School student newspaper, ''The Cubberley Catamount.'' It is only briefly mentioned in two issues,&lt;ref name="catamount_11_13"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cubberleycatamount.com/Content/66-67/Catamount%20Pages/V11No13/ |title=''Cubberley Catamount'' Volume 11, No. 13 April 7, 1967 |publisher=Ellwood P. Cubberley High School |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catamount_12_6"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cubberleycatamount.com/Content/67-68/Catamount%20Pages/V12No6/ |title=''Cubberley Catamount'' Volume 12 No. 6 December 8, 1967 |publisher=Ellwood P. Cubberley High School |date=1967-12-08 |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one more issue of the paper has a longer article about this experiment at its conclusion.&lt;ref name="catamount_11_14" /&gt; Jones himself wrote a detailed account of the experiment some nine years afterwards&lt;ref name="Jones_essay" /&gt; and more articles about the experiment followed, including some interviews with Jones and the original students.&lt;ref name="wave.html" /&gt;

==Chronology==
===First day===
Jones writes that he started the first day of the experiment with simple things such as proper seating and extensively drilling the students.&lt;ref name="Jones_essay" /&gt; He then proceeded to enforce strict classroom discipline by emerging as an authoritarian figure and dramatically improving the efficiency of the class.

The first day's session was closed with only a few rules, intending to be a one-day experiment. Students had to be sitting at attention before the second bell, had to stand up to ask or answer questions and had to do it in three words or fewer, and were required to preface each remark with "Mr. Jones".&lt;ref name="Jones_essay" /&gt;

===Second day===
On the second day, he managed to meld his history class into a group with a supreme sense of discipline and community. Jones based the name of his movement, "The Third Wave", on the supposed fact that the third in a series of waves is the strongest.&lt;ref name="Jones_essay" /&gt;  Jones created a salute involving a cupped hand reaching across the chest toward the opposite shoulder&lt;ref name="Jones_essay" /&gt; resembling a [[Hitler salute]]&lt;ref name="catamount_11_14" /&gt;, and ordered class members to salute each other even outside the class. They all complied with this command.&lt;ref name="Jones_essay" /&gt;

===Third day===
The experiment took on a life of its own, with students from all over the school joining in: some students who did not take the history class but had a free period decided to join the class. On the third day, the class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees. All of the students showed drastic improvement in their academic skills and tremendous motivation. All of the students were issued a member card, and each of them received a special assignment, like designing a Third Wave Banner, stopping non-members from entering the class, or the like. Jones instructed the students on how to initiate new members, and by the end of the day the movement had over 200 participants.&lt;ref name="Jones_essay" /&gt; Jones was surprised that some of the students started reporting to him when other members of the movement failed to abide by the rules.&lt;ref name="Jones_essay" /&gt;

===Fourth day===
On Thursday{{dubious|date=April 2018}}, the fourth day of the experiment, Jones decided to terminate the movement because it was slipping out of his control. The students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was outstanding. He announced to the participants that this movement was a part of a nationwide movement and that on the next day a presidential candidate of the Third Wave would publicly announce its existence. Jones ordered students to attend a noon rally on Friday to witness the announcement.&lt;ref name="Jones_essay" /&gt;

===Fifth and last day===
Instead of a televised address of their leader, the students were presented with [[Noise (video)|an empty channel]]. After a few minutes of waiting, Jones announced that they had been a part of an experiment in [[fascism]] and that they all willingly created a sense of superiority like German citizens had in the period of Nazi Germany. He then played them a film about the Nazi regime to conclude the experiment.&lt;ref name="Jones_essay" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
On October 10, 2010, the documentary, ''[[Lesson Plan]]'', which retold the story of the Third Wave through interviews with the original students and teacher, debuted at the [[Mill Valley Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ducey|first=Patricia|title=Experiment in Fascism at an American High School: The Lesson Plan @ The Newport Beach Film Festival|url=http://www.libertasfilmmagazine.com/experiment-in-fascism-at-an-american-high-school-the-lesson-plan-the-newport-beach-film-festival/|work=Libertas Film Magazine|accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by Philip Neel, one of Jones's own former students.

===Dramatizations===
The events of the experiment were adapted into a 1981 US TV special, ''[[The Wave (TV special)|The Wave]]''. This formed the basis for the [[Young adult fiction|Young Adult]] [[novelization]] [[The Wave (book)|of the same name]] by [[Todd Strasser]], who used the pen name Morton Rhue in Europe.

The 2008 German film ''[[The Wave (2008 film)|Die Welle]]'' transferred the experiment to a modern-day German classroom. The film received critical acclaim. The story is being adapted as a [[The Wave (miniseries)|German-produced miniseries]] based jointly on the 2008 film and the 1981 novelization.

"The Pride of Lakewood", a 2010 episode of children's animated series ''[[Arthur (TV Series)|Arthur]]'', "The Pride of Lakewood", was loosely based on the Third Wave experiment. In it, students who form a community pride group become fascistic.

In 2010, Jones staged a musical called ''The Wave'', written with some of the students in the class.&lt;ref name="sfgate_01_30"&gt;{{cite web|last=Whiting |first=Sam |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/01/30/DDM51BLIU1.DTL |title=In 'The Wave,' ex-teacher Ron Jones looks back |publisher=SFGat.come |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{note|timing}} &lt;small&gt;In,&lt;ref name="catamount_11_13" /&gt;  which was published on Friday, April 7, reports of "strange happenings in Mr. Jones' [...] classes" are mentioned without further detail, which confirms that the movement was active, but not yet finished in the week starting on April 3, 1967. In,&lt;ref name="catamount_11_14" /&gt;  published on April 21, the experiment is dated "two weeks ago", which also puts the experiment in the first week of April – it specifically calls out "...Wednesday, April 5, the last day of the movement."&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29484">The '''theory of solar cells''' explains the process by which light energy in [[photon]]s is converted into electric current when the photons strike a suitable semiconductor device. The theoretical studies are of practical use because they predict the fundamental limits of a [[solar cell]], and give guidance on the phenomena that contribute to losses and [[solar cell efficiency]].
[[File:Solargif1.gif|thumb|400px|Band diagram of a solar cell, corresponding to very low current (horizontal [[Fermi level]]), very low voltage (metal valence bands at same height), and therefore very low illumination]]

==Simple explanation==
# [[Photon]]s in [[sunlight]] hit the solar panel and are absorbed by semi-conducting materials.
# [[Electrons]] (negatively charged) are knocked loose from their atoms as they are excited. Due to their special structure and the materials in solar cells, the electrons are only allowed to move in a single direction. The electronic structure of the materials is very important for the process to work, and often [[silicon]] incorporating small amounts of [[boron]] or [[phosphorus]] is used in different layers.
# An array of solar cells converts solar energy into a usable amount of [[direct current]] (DC) electricity.

==Photogeneration of charge carriers==
When a [[photon]] hits a piece of silicon, one of three things can happen:
# The photon can pass straight through the silicon — this (generally) happens for lower energy photons.
# The photon can reflect off the surface.
# The photon can be absorbed by the silicon if the photon energy is higher than the silicon [[band gap]] value. This generates an electron-hole pair and sometimes heat depending on the band structure.
[[File:BandDiagramSolarCell-en.gif|300 px|thumb|[[Band diagram]] of a silicon solar cell, corresponding to very low current (horizontal [[Fermi level]]), very low voltage (metal valence bands at same height), and therefore very low illumination]]
When a photon is absorbed, its energy is given to an electron in the crystal lattice. Usually this electron is in the [[valence band]]. The energy given to the electron by the photon "excites" it into the [[conduction band]] where it is free to move around within the semiconductor. The network of covalent bonds that the electron was previously a part of now has one fewer electron. This is known as a hole. The presence of a missing covalent bond allows the bonded electrons of neighboring atoms to move into the "hole," leaving another hole behind, thus propagating holes throughout the lattice. It can be said that photons absorbed in the semiconductor create electron-hole pairs.

A photon only needs to have energy greater than that of the band gap in order to excite an electron from the valence band into the conduction band. However, the solar [[frequency spectrum]] approximates a [[black body]] spectrum at about 5,800&amp;nbsp;K,&lt;ref&gt;[http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Display=Facts&amp;Object=Sun NASA Solar System Exploration - Sun: Facts &amp; Figures] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703111716/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Sun&amp;Display=Facts |date=2015-07-03 }} retrieved 27 April 2011 "Effective Temperature ... 5777&amp;nbsp;K"&lt;/ref&gt; and as such, much of the solar radiation reaching the [[Earth]] is composed of photons with energies greater than the band gap of silicon. These higher energy photons will be absorbed by the solar cell, but the difference in energy between these photons and the silicon band gap is converted into heat (via lattice vibrations — called [[phonons]]) rather than into usable electrical energy.  The photovoltaic effect can also occur when two photons are absorbed simultaneously in a process called [[two-photon photovoltaic effect]]. However, high optical intensities are required for this nonlinear process.

==The p-n junction==
{{Main|semiconductor|p-n junction}}

The most commonly known solar cell is configured as a large-area p-n junction made from silicon. As a simplification, one can imagine bringing a layer of n-type silicon into direct contact with a layer of p-type silicon. In practice, p-n junctions of silicon solar cells are not made in this way, but rather by diffusing an n-type dopant into one side of a p-type wafer (or vice versa).

If a piece of p-type silicon is placed in close contact with a piece of n-type silicon, then a [[diffusion]] of electrons occurs from the region of high electron concentration (the n-type side of the junction) into the region of low electron concentration (p-type side of the junction). When the electrons diffuse across the p-n junction, they recombine with holes on the p-type side. However (in the absence of an external circuit) this diffusion of carriers does not go on indefinitely because charges build up on either side of the junction and create an [[electric field]]. The electric field promotes charge flow, known as [[drift current]], that opposes and eventually balances out the diffusion of electrons and holes. This region where electrons and holes have diffused across the junction is called the [[depletion zone|depletion region]] because it contains practically no mobile charge carriers. It is also known as the ''space charge region'', although space charge extends a bit further in both directions than the depletion region.

==Charge carrier separation==
There are two causes of charge carrier motion and separation in a solar cell:

#'''drift''' of carriers, driven by the electric field, with electrons being pushed one way and holes the other way
#'''diffusion''' of carriers from zones of higher carrier concentration to zones of lower carrier concentration (following a gradient of chemical potential).

These two "forces" may work one against the other at any given point in the cell. For instance, an electron moving through the junction from the p region to the n region (as in the diagram at the beginning of this article) is being pushed by the electric field against the concentration gradient. The same goes for a hole moving in the opposite direction.

It is easiest to understand how a current is generated when considering electron-hole pairs that are created in the depletion zone, which is where there is a strong electric field. The electron is pushed by this field toward the n side and the hole toward the p side. (This is opposite to the direction of current in a forward-biased diode, such as a [[light-emitting diode]] in operation.) When the pair is created outside the space charge zone, where the electric field is smaller, diffusion also acts to move the carriers, but the junction still plays a role by sweeping any electrons that reach it from the p side to the n side, and by sweeping any holes that reach it from the n side to the p side, thereby creating a concentration gradient outside the space charge zone.

In thick solar cells there is very little electric field in the active region outside the space charge zone, so the dominant mode of charge carrier separation is diffusion. In these cells the diffusion length of minority carriers (the length that photo-generated carriers can travel before they recombine) must be large compared to the cell thickness.  In thin film cells (such as amorphous silicon), the diffusion length of minority carriers is usually very short due to the existence of defects, and the dominant charge separation is therefore drift, driven by the electrostatic field of the junction, which extends to the whole thickness of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Topics in Applied Physics: Amorphous Semiconductors: Amorphous silicon solar cells|author = Carlson, D., Wronski, C.|publisher = Springer Berlin / Heidelberg|url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/7x665jq810p8421u/|year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the minority carrier enters the drift region, it is 'swept' across the junction and, at the other side of the junction, becomes a majority carrier. This reverse current is a generation current, fed both thermally and (if present) by the absorption of light. On the other hand, majority carriers are driven into the drift region by diffusion (resulting from the concentration gradient), which leads to the forward current; only the majority carriers with the highest energies (in the so-called Boltzmann tail; cf. [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]]) can fully cross the drift region. Therefore, the carrier distribution in the whole device is governed by a dynamic equilibrium between reverse current and forward current.

==Connection to an external load==
[[Ohmic contact|Ohmic]] [[metal]]-semiconductor contacts are made to both the n-type and p-type sides of the solar cell, and the [[electrodes]] connected to an external load. Electrons that are created on the n-type side, or created on the p-type side, "collected" by the junction and swept onto the n-type side, may travel through the wire, power the load, and continue through the wire until they reach the p-type semiconductor-metal contact. Here, they recombine with a hole that was either created as an electron-hole pair on the p-type side of the solar cell, or a hole that was swept across the junction from the n-type side after being created there.

The voltage measured is equal to the difference in the [[quasi Fermi levels]] of the majority carriers (electrons in the n-type portion and holes in the p-type portion) at the two terminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The solar cell under illumination|url=https://www.pvlighthouse.com.au/resources/courses/altermatt/The%20PV%20Principle/The%20solar%20cell%20under%20illumination.aspx|website=PV Lighthouse|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215152707/https://www.pvlighthouse.com.au/resources/courses/altermatt/The%20PV%20Principle/The%20solar%20cell%20under%20illumination.aspx|archivedate=February 15, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivalent circuit of a solar cell==
[[File:Solar cell equivalent circuit.svg|left|thumb|275px|The equivalent circuit of a solar cell]]
[[File:Photovoltaic cell.svg|thumb|100px|The schematic symbol of a solar cell]]

To understand the electronic behavior of a solar cell, it is useful to create a [[Physical model|model]] which is electrically equivalent, and is based on discrete ideal electrical components whose behavior is well defined. An ideal solar cell may be modelled by a current source in parallel with a [[diode]]; in practice no solar cell is ideal, so a [[shunt (electrical)|shunt]] resistance and a series resistance component are added to the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Solar Electricity: Engineering of Photovoltaic Systems|author = Eduardo Lorenzo|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lYc53xZyxZQC&amp;pg=PA78|publisher = Progensa|isbn = 84-86505-55-0|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting equivalent circuit of a solar cell is shown on the left. Also shown, on the right, is the schematic representation of a solar cell for use in circuit diagrams.
{{Clear}}

===Characteristic equation===
From the equivalent circuit it is evident that the current produced by the solar cell is equal to that produced by the current source, minus that which flows through the diode, minus that which flows through the shunt resistor:&lt;ref name="Luque"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Photovoltaic Science and Engineering|author1=Antonio Luque  |author2=Steven Hegedus |lastauthoramp=yes |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u-bCMhl_JjQC&amp;pg=PT326|publisher = John Wiley and Sons|year = 2003|isbn = 0-471-49196-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nelson&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Physics of Solar Cells|author = Jenny Nelson|publisher = Imperial College Press|year = 2003|isbn = 978-1-86094-340-9|url=http://www.solarfreaks.com/download/file.php?id=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''I&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' = diode current (ampere)
*''I&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt;'' = shunt current (ampere).

The current through these elements is governed by the voltage across them:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{j} = V + I R_{S}&lt;/math&gt;

where
*''V&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = voltage across both diode and resistor ''R&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt;'' ([[volt]])
*''V'' = voltage across the output terminals (volt)
*''I'' = output current (ampere)
*''R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' = series resistance ([[Ohm|Ω]]).

By the [[Diode#Shockley diode equation|Shockley diode equation]], the current diverted through the diode is:

:&lt;math&gt;I_{D} = I_{0} \left\{\exp\left[\frac{V_{j}}{nV_T}\right] - 1\right\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''exp'' represents the [[exponential function]]&lt;/ref&gt;

where
*''I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = reverse [[saturation current]] (ampere)
*''n'' = diode ideality factor (1 for an ideal diode)
*''q'' = [[elementary charge]]
*''k'' = [[Boltzmann's constant]]
*''T'' = [[absolute temperature]]
*&lt;math&gt;V_T=kT/q,&lt;/math&gt; the [[thermal voltage]]. At 25&amp;nbsp;°C, &lt;math&gt;V_T\approx 0.0259&lt;/math&gt; volt.

By [[Ohm's law]], the current diverted through the shunt resistor is:

:&lt;math&gt;I_{SH} = \frac{V_{j}}{R_{SH}}&lt;/math&gt;

where
*''R&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt;'' = shunt resistance (Ω).

Substituting these into the first equation produces the characteristic equation of a solar cell, which relates solar cell parameters to the output current and voltage:

:&lt;math&gt;I = I_{L} - I_{0} \left\{\exp\left[\frac{V + I R_{S}}{nV_T}\right] - 1\right\} - \frac{V + I R_{S}}{R_{SH}}.&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative derivation produces an equation similar in appearance, but with ''V'' on the left-hand side. The two alternatives are [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]]; that is, they yield precisely the same results.

Since the parameters ''I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, n, R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''R&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt;'' cannot be measured directly, the most common application of the characteristic equation is [[nonlinear regression]] to extract the values of these parameters on the basis of their combined effect on solar cell behavior.

When ''R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not zero, the above equation does not give the current ''I'' directly, but it can then be solved using the [[Lambert W function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;I=\frac{(I_L+I_0)-V/R_{SH}}{1+R_S/R_{SH}}-\frac{nV_T}{R_S}W\left(\frac{I_0R_S}{nV_T(1+R_S/R_{SH})}\exp\left(\frac V{nV_T}\left(1-\frac{R_S}{R_S+R_{SH}}\right)+\frac{(I_L+I_0)R_S}{nV_T(1+R_S/R_{SH})}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

When an external load is used with the cell, its resistance can simply be added to ''R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V'' set to zero in order to find the current.

When ''R&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt;'' is infinite there is a solution for ''V'' for any &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; less than &lt;math&gt;I_L+I_0&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;V=nV_T\ln\left(\frac{I_L-I}{I_0}+1\right)-IR_S.&lt;/math&gt;

Otherwise one can solve for ''V'' using the Lambert W function:

:&lt;math&gt;V=(I_L+I_0)R_{SH}-I(R_S+R_{SH})-nV_TW\left(\frac{I_0R_{SH}}{nV_T}\exp\left(\frac{(I_L+I_0-I)R_{SH}}{nV_T}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

However, when ''R&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt;'' is large it's better to solve the original equation numerically.

The general form of the solution is a curve with ''I'' decreasing as ''V'' increases (see graphs lower down). The slope at small or negative ''V'' (where the ''W'' function is near zero) approaches &lt;math&gt;-1/(R_S+R_{SH})&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the slope at high ''V'' approaches &lt;math&gt;-1/R_S&lt;/math&gt;.

====Open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current====
When the cell is operated at [[Open-circuit_voltage|open circuit]], ''I = 0'' and the voltage across the output terminals is defined as the ''open-circuit voltage''. Assuming the shunt resistance is high enough to neglect the final term of the characteristic equation, the open-circuit voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;V_{OC} \approx \frac{nkT}{q} \ln \left(\frac{I_L}{I_0} + 1\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, when the cell is operated at [[short circuit]], ''V = 0'' and the current ''I'' through the terminals is defined as the ''short-circuit current''. It can be shown that for a high-quality solar cell (low ''R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', and high ''R&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt;'') the short-circuit current ''I&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;I_{SC} \approx I_L.&lt;/math&gt;

It is not possible to extract any power from the device when operating at either open circuit or short circuit conditions.

====Effect of physical size====
The values of ''I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''R&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt;'' are dependent upon the physical size of the solar cell. In comparing otherwise identical cells, a cell with twice the junction area of another will, in principle, have double the ''I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; because it has twice the area where photocurrent is generated and across which diode current can flow. By the same argument, it will also have half the ''R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the series resistance related to vertical current flow; however, for large-area silicon solar cells, the scaling of the series resistance encountered by lateral current flow is not easily predictable since it will depend crucially on the grid design (it is not clear what "otherwise identical" means in this respect). Depending on the shunt type, the larger cell may also have half the ''R&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt;'' because it has twice the area where shunts may occur; on the other hand, if shunts occur mainly at the perimeter, then ''R&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt;'' will decrease according to the change in circumference, not area.

Since the changes in the currents are the dominating ones and are balancing each other, the open-circuit voltage is practically the same; ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;'' starts to depend on the cell size only if ''R&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt;'' becomes too low.  To account for the dominance of the currents, the characteristic equation is frequently written in terms of [[current density]], or current produced per unit cell area:

:&lt;math&gt;J = J_{L} - J_{0} \left\{\exp\left[\frac{q(V + J r_{S})}{nkT}\right] - 1\right\} - \frac{V + J r_{S}}{r_{SH}}&lt;/math&gt;

where
*''J'' = current density (ampere/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
*''J&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' = photogenerated current density (ampere/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
*''J''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = reverse saturation current density (ampere/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
*''r&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' = specific series resistance (Ω-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
*''r&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt;'' = specific shunt resistance (Ω-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

This formulation has several advantages. One is that since cell characteristics are referenced to a common cross-sectional area they may be compared for cells of different physical dimensions. While this is of limited benefit in a manufacturing setting, where all cells tend to be the same size, it is useful in research and in comparing cells between manufacturers. Another advantage is that the density equation naturally scales the parameter values to similar orders of magnitude, which can make numerical extraction of them simpler and more accurate even with naive solution methods.

There are practical limitations of this formulation.  For instance, certain parasitic effects grow in importance as cell sizes shrink and can affect the extracted parameter values. Recombination and contamination of the junction tend to be greatest at the perimeter of the cell, so very small cells may exhibit higher values of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or lower values of ''R&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt;'' than larger cells that are otherwise identical. In such cases, comparisons between cells must be made cautiously and with these effects in mind.

This approach should only be used for comparing solar cells with comparable layout.  For instance, a comparison between primarily quadratical solar cells like typical crystalline silicon solar cells and narrow but long solar cells like typical [[thin film solar cell]]s can lead to wrong assumptions caused by the different kinds of current paths and therefore the influence of, for instance, a distributed series resistance contribution to ''r''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Aberle and S.R. Wenham and M.A. Green, "A new Method for Accurate Measurements of the Lumped Series Resistance of Solar Cells", Proceedings of the 23rd IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference, p. 113-139, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, L.D., Distributed Series Resistance Effects in Solar Cells", IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, Volume 29, Issue 5, p. 821 - 827, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  Macro-architecture of the solar cells could result in different surface areas being placed in any fixed volume - particularly for [[thin film solar cells]] and [[flexible solar cells]] which may allow for highly convoluted folded structures.  If volume is the binding constraint, then efficiency density based on surface area may be of less relevance.

====Transparent conducting electrodes====

[[File:Solar tce.gif|thumb|Schematic of charge collection by solar cell electrodes.  Light transmits through transparent conducting electrode creating electron hole pairs, which are collected by both the electrodes.&lt;ref name=Kumar2017 /&gt; 
  ]]

Transparent conducting electrodes are essential components of solar cells. It is either a continuous film of [[indium tin oxide]] or a conducting wire network, in which wires are charge collectors while voids between wires are transparent for light. An optimum density of wire network is essential for the maximum solar cell performance as higher wire density blocks the light transmittance while lower wire density leads to high recombination losses due to more distance traveled by the charge carriers.&lt;ref name=Kumar2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Ankush|date=|year=2017|title=Predicting efficiency of solar cells based on transparent conducting electrodes|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4973117|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=121|issue=1|pages=014502|doi=10.1063/1.4973117|issn=0021-8979|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cell temperature====
[[File:I-V Curve T.png|thumb|250px|Effect of temperature on the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell]]

Temperature affects the characteristic equation in two ways: directly, via ''T'' in the exponential term, and indirectly via its effect on ''I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' (strictly speaking, temperature affects all of the terms, but these two far more significantly than the others). While increasing ''T'' reduces the magnitude of the exponent in the characteristic equation, the value of ''I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' increases exponentially with ''T''. The net effect is to reduce ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;'' (the open-circuit voltage) linearly with increasing temperature. The magnitude of this reduction is inversely proportional to ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;''; that is, cells with higher values of ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;'' suffer smaller reductions in voltage with increasing temperature. For most crystalline silicon solar cells the change in ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;'' with temperature is about -0.50%/°C, though the rate for the highest-efficiency crystalline silicon cells is around -0.35%/°C. By way of comparison, the rate for amorphous silicon solar cells is -0.20%/°C to -0.30%/°C, depending on how the cell is made.

The amount of photogenerated current ''I&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' increases slightly with increasing temperature because of an increase in the number of thermally generated carriers in the cell. This effect is slight, however: about 0.065%/°C for crystalline silicon cells and 0.09% for amorphous silicon cells.

The overall effect of temperature on cell efficiency can be computed using these factors in combination with the characteristic equation. However, since the change in voltage is much stronger than the change in current, the overall effect on efficiency tends to be similar to that on voltage. Most crystalline silicon solar cells decline in efficiency by 0.50%/°C and most amorphous cells decline by 0.15-0.25%/°C. The figure above shows I-V curves that might typically be seen for a crystalline silicon solar cell at various temperatures.

====Series resistance====
[[File:I-V Curve RS.PNG|thumb|250px|Effect of series resistance on the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell]]

As series resistance increases, the voltage drop between the junction voltage and the terminal voltage becomes greater for the same current. The result is that the current-controlled portion of the I-V curve begins to sag toward the origin, producing a significant decrease in the terminal voltage &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and a slight reduction in ''I&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'', the short-circuit current. Very high values of ''R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' will also produce a significant reduction in ''I&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;''; in these regimes, series resistance dominates and the behavior of the solar cell resembles that of a resistor. These effects are shown for crystalline silicon solar cells in the I-V curves displayed in the figure to the right.

Losses caused by series resistance are in a first approximation given by P&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt;=V&lt;sub&gt;Rs&lt;/sub&gt;I=I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; and increase quadratically with (photo-)current. Series resistance losses are therefore most important at high illumination intensities.
{{Clear}}

====Shunt resistance====
[[File:I-V Curve RSH.PNG|thumb|250px|Effect of shunt resistance on the current–voltage characteristics of a solar cell]]

As shunt resistance decreases, the current diverted through the shunt resistor increases for a given level of junction voltage. The result is that the voltage-controlled portion of the I-V curve begins to sag far from the origin, producing a significant decrease in the terminal current ''I'' and a slight reduction in ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;''. Very low values of ''R&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt;'' will produce a significant reduction in ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;''. Much as in the case of a high series resistance, a badly shunted solar cell will take on operating characteristics similar to those of a resistor. These effects are shown for crystalline silicon solar cells in the I-V curves displayed in the figure to the right.
{{Clear}}

====Reverse saturation current====
[[File:I-V Curve J0.PNG|thumb|250px|Effect of reverse saturation current on the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell]]

If one assumes infinite shunt resistance, the characteristic equation can be solved for ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;V_{OC} = \frac{kT}{q} \ln\left(\frac{I_{SC}}{I_{0}} + 1\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, an increase in ''I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' produces a reduction in ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;'' proportional to the inverse of the logarithm of the increase. This explains mathematically the reason for the reduction in ''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;'' that accompanies increases in temperature described above. The effect of reverse saturation current on the I-V curve of a crystalline silicon solar cell are shown in the figure to the right. Physically, reverse saturation current is a measure of the "leakage" of carriers across the p-n junction in reverse bias. This leakage is a result of carrier recombination in the neutral regions on either side of the junction.
{{Clear}}

====Ideality factor====
[[File:I-V Curve n.PNG|thumb|250px|Effect of ideality factor on the current-voltage characteristics of a solar cell]]

The ideality factor (also called the emissivity factor) is a fitting parameter that describes how closely the diode's behavior matches that predicted by theory, which assumes the p-n junction of the diode is an infinite plane and no recombination occurs within the space-charge region. A perfect match to theory is indicated when ''n = 1''. When recombination in the space-charge region dominate other recombination, however, ''n = 2''. The effect of changing ideality factor independently of all other parameters is shown for a crystalline silicon solar cell in the I-V curves displayed in the figure to the right.

Most solar cells, which are quite large compared to conventional diodes, well approximate an infinite plane and will usually exhibit near-ideal behavior under [[Standard Test Condition]] (''n ≈ 1''). Under certain operating conditions, however, device operation may be dominated by recombination in the space-charge region. This is characterized by a significant increase in ''I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' as well as an increase in ideality factor to ''n ≈ 2''. The latter tends to increase solar cell output voltage while the former acts to erode it. The net effect, therefore, is a combination of the increase in voltage shown for increasing ''n'' in the figure to the right and the decrease in voltage shown for increasing ''I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the figure above. Typically, ''I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the more significant factor and the result is a reduction in voltage.

Sometimes, the ideality factor is observed to be greater than 2, which is generally attributed to the presence of Schottky diode or heterojunction in the solar cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Correlated Nonideal Effects of Dark and Light I #x2013;V Characteristics in a-Si/c-Si Heterojunction Solar Cells|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6777567|journal = IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics|date = 2014-05-01|issn = 2156-3381|pages = 763–771|volume = 4|issue = 3|doi = 10.1109/JPHOTOV.2014.2307171|first = R.V.K.|last = Chavali|first2 = J.R.|last2 = Wilcox|first3 = B.|last3 = Ray|first4 = J.L.|last4 = Gray|first5 = M.A.|last5 = Alam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of a heterojunction offset reduces the collection efficiency of the solar cell and may contribute to low fill-factor.

[[Image:Tittles.svg|right|thumb|150px|Lowercase i and j in [[Liberation fonts|Liberation Serif]], with tittles in red.]]
A '''tittle''' or '''superscript dot'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/words/is-there-a-name-for-the-dot-above-the-letters-i-and-j Oxford Dictionaries Online (US) — Is there a name for the dot above the letters i and j?]&lt;/ref&gt; is a small distinguishing mark, such as a [[diacritic]] or the dot on a [[lowercase]] ''i'' or ''j''.  The tittle is an integral part of the [[glyph]] of ''i'' and ''j'', but [[dot (diacritic)|diacritic dot]]s can appear over other letters in various languages. In most languages, the tittle of ''i'' or ''j'' is omitted when a diacritic is placed in the tittle's usual position (as [[í]] or [[ĵ]]), but not when the diacritic appears elsewhere (as [[į]], [[ɉ]]).

==Use==
The word ''tittle'' is rarely used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=tittle&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2007&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=0&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Ctittle%3B%2Cc0 nGram: tittle]&lt;/ref&gt; One notable occurrence is in the [[King James Bible]] at [[Matthew 5:18]]: "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled" ([[KJV]]). The quotation uses them as an example of extremely minor details. The phrase "jot and tittle" indicates that every small detail has received attention.

In the [[Greek language|Greek]] original translated as English "[[Jot (letter)|jot]] and tittle" are found the words ''iota'' and ''[[keraia (disambiguation)|keraia]]'' ({{lang-el|κεραία}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/strongs.pl?strongs=2503 Blue Letter Bible]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iota]] is the smallest letter of the [[Greek alphabet]] (ι); the even smaller [[iota subscript]] was a medieval introduction. Alternatively, it may represent [[yodh]] (י), the smallest letter of the Hebrew and [[Aramaic alphabet]]s. "Keraia" is a hook or [[serif]], possibly referring to other Greek diacritics, or possibly to the hooks on Hebrew letters (ב) versus (כ) or cursive scripts for languages derived from Aramaic, such as [[Syriac language|Syriac]], written in [[Syriac alphabet#West Syriac Ser.E1.B9.AD.C4.81|Serṭā]] ({{Script/Serto|ܣܶܪܛܳܐ}}, 'short line'),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dukhrana.com/peshitta/analyze_verse.php?lang=en&amp;verse=Matthew+5:18&amp;source=ubs&amp;font=Estrangelo+Edessa&amp;size=125% Grammatical analysis of Syriac Peshitta] Gospel of Matthew verse 5:18&lt;/ref&gt; or for adding explicit vowel marks such as crowns (e.g. the [[Vulgate]] ''apex'') known as [[Niqqud]] that developed with later scribal practices in the Torah. A keraia is also used in printing modern [[Greek numerals]]. In many [[abjads]] only consonants such as yodh in Hebrew have character forms; a word's phonetic pronunciation depends on unwritten or indistinct vowel markings such that many meanings can be rendered ambiguous or corrupted via oral transmission over time.

==Dotless and dotted i==

{{See also|Dotted and dotless I}}

A number of alphabets use dotted and dotless I, both upper and lower case.

In the modern [[Turkish alphabet]], the absence or presence of a tittle distinguishes [[Turkish dotted and dotless I|two different letters]] representing two different [[phonemes]]: the letter "I" / "ı", with the absence of a tittle also on the lower case letter, represents the [[close back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[ɯ]}}, while "İ" / "i", with the inclusion of a tittle even on the capital letter, represents the [[close front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[i]}}. This practice has carried over to several other [[Turkic languages]], like the [[Azerbaijani alphabet]], [[Crimean Tatar alphabet]], and [[Tatar alphabet]].

In some of the Dene languages of the [[Northwest Territories]] in Canada, specifically [[South Slavey|North Slavey, South Slavey]], [[Dogrib language|Tłı̨chǫ]] and [[Chipewyan language|Dëne Sųłıné]], all instances of ''i'' are undotted to avoid confusion with tone-marked vowels ''í'' or ''ì''. The other Dene language of the Northwest Territories, [[Gwichin language|Gwich’in]], always includes the tittle on lowercase ''i''.

There is only one letter I in [[Irish language|Irish]], but ''i'' is undotted in the traditional [[uncial]] [[Gaelic type|Gaelic script]] to avoid confusion of the tittle with the [[dot (diacritic)#Overdot|''buailte'' overdot]] found over [[consonant]]s.  [[Irish orthography#Alphabet|Modern texts]] replace the ''buailte'' with an ''h'', and use the same [[antiqua script|antiqua]]-descendant fonts, which have a tittle, as other Latin-alphabet languages.  However, [[road signs in Ireland|bilingual road signs]] use dotless i in lowercase Irish text to better distinguish ''i'' from ''[[í]]''.  The letter "j" is not used in Irish other than in foreign words.

In most Latin-based orthographies, the lowercase letter ''i'' loses its dot when a diacritical mark, such as an [[Acute accent|acute]] or [[grave accent]], is placed atop the letter. However, the tittle is sometimes retained in some languages. In the [[Baltic languages]], the lowercase letter ''i'' sometimes retains a tittle when accented.&lt;ref name="Wells 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Orthographic diacritics and multilingual computing|first=John C.|last=Wells|journal=[[Language Problems and Language Planning]]|location=[[Amsterdam]]|publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]]|volume=24|issue=3|year=2001|issn=0272-2690|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/dia/diacritics-revised.htm|quote=A further complication is the convention of removing the dot from '''i''' and '''j''' when adding a diacritic over them, as in '''í''', '''ì''', '''î''', '''ĵ'''. In the Baltic countries, however, the dot is sometimes retained in these circumstances.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] in the 17th century,&lt;ref name="De Rhodes 1641"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum|first=Alexander|last=de Rhodes|authorlink=Alexander de Rhodes|publisher=[[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith]]|location=Rome|year=1651|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AdHAAAAcAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tittle is preserved atop ''ỉ'' and ''ị'' but not ''ì'' and ''í'', as seen in the seminal ''quốc ngữ'' reference ''[[Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum]]''. In modern Vietnamese, a tittle can be seen in ''ì'', ''ỉ'', ''ĩ'', and ''í'' in cursive handwriting and some signage. This detail rarely occurs in computers and on the Internet, due to the obscurity of language-specific fonts. In any case, the tittle is always retained in ''ị''.

* It is thought that the phrase "to a T" is derived from the word tittle because long before "to a T" became popular, the phrase "to a tittle" was used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-toa2.htm Where did the phrase "to the T" come from?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The phrase "[[wikt:dot the i's and cross the t's|to dot one's I's and cross one's T's]]" is used literally and also to mean "to put the finishing touches to" or "to be thorough".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12632">[[Trace fossil]]s are [[Biological classification|classified]] in various ways for different purposes. Traces can be classified [[#Taxonomic classification|taxonomically]] (by morphology), [[#Ethologic classification|ethologically]] (by behavior), and [[#Toponomic classification|toponomically]], that is, according to their relationship to the surrounding sedimentary layers. Except in the rare cases where the original maker of a trace fossil can be identified with confidence, phylogenetic classification of trace fossils is an unreasonable proposition.

==Taxonomic classification== &lt;!--intro links here--&gt;
The '''taxonomic classification of trace fossils''' parallels the taxonomic classification of [[organism]]s under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]. In [[trace fossil]] nomenclature a [[Latin]] [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] is used, just as in [[animal]] and [[plant]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], with a [[genus]] and [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]]. However, the binomial names are not linked to an organism, but rather just a trace fossil. This is due to the rarity of association between a trace fossil and a specific organism or group of organisms. Trace fossils are therefore included in an ''[[ichnotaxon]]'' separate from [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. When referring to trace fossils, the terms ''ichnogenus'' and ''ichnospecies'' parallel genus and [[species]] respectively.

The most promising cases of phylogenetic classification are those in which similar trace fossils show details complex enough to deduce the makers, such as [[bryozoan]] [[bioerosion|borings]], large [[trilobite]] trace fossils such as ''[[Cruziana]]'', and [[vertebrate]] [[footprints]]. However, most trace fossils lack sufficiently complex details to allow such classification.

==Ethologic classification==

===The Seilacherian System===
[[File:BoredEncrustedShell.JPG|thumb|Sponge borings (''[[Entobia]]'') and encrusters on a modern bivalve shell, North Carolina; an example of ''Domichnia''.]]
[[Adolf Seilacher]] was the first to propose a broadly accepted [[ethology|ethological]] basis for trace fossil classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seilacher |first=A. |year=1953 |title=Studien zur Paläontologie: 1. Über die Methoden der Palichnologie |journal=Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie |series=Abhandlungen |volume=96 |pages=421–452 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seilacher, A 1964"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seilacher |first=A. |year=1964 |title=Sedimentological classification and nomenclature of trace fossils |journal=Sedimentology |volume=3 |issue= |pages=253–256 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1964.tb00464.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; He recognized that most trace fossils are created by [[animal]]s in one of five main behavioural activities, and named them accordingly:

* ''Cubichnia'' are the traces of organisms left on the surface of a soft [[sediment]]. This behaviour may simply be resting as in the case of a [[starfish]], but might also evidence the hiding place of [[prey]], or even the ambush position of a [[predator]].
* ''Domichnia'' are dwelling structures that reflect the life positions of organisms, for example the subsurface [[burrow]]s or [[bioerosion|borings]] of [[suspension feeder]]s, and are perhaps the most common of the established ethological classes.
* ''[[Fodinichnia]]'' are feeding traces which are formed as a result of organisms disturbing the sediment in their search for food. They are normally created by [[deposit feeder]]s as they tunnel through soft sediments, usually producing a 3D structure.
* ''Pascichnia'' are a different type of feeding trace for which the trophic guild responsible are [[grazing|grazer]]s. They create 2D features as they scour the surface of a hard or soft [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] in order to obtain [[nutriment]].
* ''Repichnia'' are locomotory tracks that show evidence of organisms moving from one station to another, usually in a near-straight to slightly curved line. Most of the very few traces to be verifiably assigned to a specific organism are in this category, such as various [[arthropod]] and [[vertebrate]] trackways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seilacher |first=A. |year=1967 |title=Bathymetry of trace fossils |journal=Marine Geology |volume=5 |issue= |pages=413–428 |doi=10.1016/0025-3227(67)90051-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other ethological classes===

Since the inception of behavioural categorization, several other ethological classes have been suggested and accepted, as follows:

* ''Aedificichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bown |first=T. M. |last2=Ratcliffe |first2=B. C. |year=1988 |title=The origin of ''Chubutolithes'' Ihering, ichnofossils from the Eocene and Oligocene of Chubut province, Argentina |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=163–167 |doi=10.1017/S0022336000029802 }}&lt;/ref&gt; evidence of organisms building structures outside of the [[infauna]]l realm, such as [[termite]] mounds or [[wasp]] nests.
* ''Agrichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Ekdale, AA; Bromley, RG; Pemberton, SG (1984) Ichnology: Trace fossils in sedimentology and stratigraphy. Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists Short Course, no 15, 317 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; so called "gardening traces", which are systematic burrow networks designed to capture migrating [[meiofauna]] or perhaps even to culture [[bacteria]]. The organism would have continually inspected this burrow system to prey on any smaller organisms that strayed into it.
* ''Calichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Genise, JF &amp; Bown, TM (1991) New Miocene scarabaeid and hymenopterous nests and Early Miocene (Santacrucian) palaeoenvironments, Patagonian Argentina. Ichnos, 3: 107–117.&lt;/ref&gt; structures that were created by organisms specifically for [[Reproduction|breeding]] purposes, e.g. [[bee]] cells.
* ''Equilibrichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, RG (1990) Trace fossils: biology and taphonomy. Unwin Hyman Ltd, London, 280 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; burrows within the sediment that show evidence for organisms' responses to variations in sedimentation rate (i.e. the burrow moves upwards to avoid burial, or downwards to avoid exposure). Typically this evidence will be in the form of [[spreiten]], which are small laminations in the sediment that reflect previous positions the organisms were in.
* ''[[Fugichnia]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, S (1975) The morphological classification of trace fossils. In Frey, RW (ed.) The study of trace fossils. New York, Springer-Verlag, pp 39-54.&lt;/ref&gt; "escape traces" that are formed as a result of organisms' attempts to escape burial in sudden high-sedimentation events like [[turbidity current]]s. The burrows are often marked with chevron patterns showing the upward direction the organisms were tunnelling.
* ''Praedichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Ekdale, AA (1985) Palaeoecology of the marine endobenthos. Palaeogeography, Palaeoecology, Palaeoclimatology 50: 63-81.&lt;/ref&gt; trace fossils that show evidence of [[predator]]y behaviour, such as the drill holes ([[bioerosion|borings]]) left in [[Animal shell|shell]]s by [[carnivorous]] [[gastropod]]s, or more dramatically, the bite marks found on some [[vertebrate]] [[bone]]s.

Over the years several other behavioural groups have been proposed, but in general they have been quickly discarded by the ichnological community. Some of the failed proposals are listed below, with a brief description.

* ''Chemichnia'': a type of agrichnia applied specifically to those instances of [[bacteria]]l harvesting.
* ''Cecidoichnia'': a plant trace in which a gall is left on the plant as a result of interaction with animals, bacteria, or other plants.
* ''Corrosichnia'': traces that are left by plant [[root]]s as a result of their [[corrosive]] action on the sediments.
* ''Cursichnia'': a subgroup of the repichnia, created by a crawling or walking habit.
* ''Fixichnia'': traces left by [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms that anchored themselves to a hard substrate.
* ''Mordichnia'': a praedichnial subgroup that shows evidence of the prey's death as a result of the attack.
* ''Natichnia'': a type of repichnia caused by disturbances to a soft sediment by a swimming organism, e.g. a [[benthic]] [[fish]].
* ''Polychresichnia'': traces that show an origin in the combination of two or more established trace-producing behaviours, e.g. domichnia that served as the feeding position of the organisms.
* ''Sphenoichnia'': a plant trace created by the [[bioturbation]]al action of roots.
* ''Taphichnia'': fugichnia in which the organism failed to escape and was buried, often resulting in its body fossil being found in association with the trace.
* ''Volichnia'': traces that show the position a flying organism (usually an insect) landed on a soft sediment.

Fixichnia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gibert |first=J. M. de |last2=Domènech |first2=R. |last3=Martinell |first3=J. |year=2004 |title=An ethological framework for animal bioerosion trace fossils upon mineral substrates with proposal of new class, fixichnia |journal=Lethaia |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=429–437 |doi=10.1080/00241160410002144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is perhaps the group with the most weight as a candidate for the next accepted ethological class, being not fully described by any of the eleven currently accepted categories. There is also potential for the three plant traces (cecidoichnia, corrosichnia and sphenoichnia) to gain recognition in coming years, with little attention having been paid to them since their proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mikuláš |first=R. |year=1999 |title=Notes on the concept of plant trace fossils related to plant-generated sedimentary structures |journal=Věštník Českého geologického ústavu |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=39–42 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponomic classification==

Another way to classify trace fossils is to look at their relation to the [[sediment]] of origin. Martinsson&lt;ref&gt;Martinsson, A (1970) Toponomy of trace fossils. In Crimes, TP &amp; Harper, JC (eds.) (1970) Trace fossils. Geological Journal, Special Issue 3: 323-330.&lt;/ref&gt; has provided the most widely accepted of such systems, identifying four distinct classes for traces to be separated in this regard:

* ''Endichnia'' are those traces that are found wholly within the casting medium, and therefore can only have been made by an infaunal organism.
* ''Epichnia'' are found on the tops of the strata of origin, being those ridges and grooves that were formed by benthic organisms or infaunal burrows that have been exposed by [[erosion]].
* ''Exichnia'' are traces that are made of material that is different from the surrounding medium, having either been actively filled by an organism or eroded out and re-covered by an alien sediment.
* ''Hypichnia'' are ridges and grooves found on the soles of the beds of origin at their interfaces with other [[stratum|strata]], representing the opposite of epichnia.

Other classifications have been proposed,&lt;ref name="Seilacher, A 1964"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, CK (1971) Morphology and ethology of trace fossils from the Ouachita Mountains, southeast Oklahoma. Journal of Paleontology, 45: 212-246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, S (1957) On the trace fossil ''Chondrites''. Quarterly Journal, Geological Society of London 112: 475-99.&lt;/ref&gt; but none stray far from the above.

==History==

Early paleontologists originally classified many burrow fossils as the remains of marine [[algae]], as is apparent in ichnogenera named with the ''-phycus'' suffix. [[Alfred Gabriel Nathorst]] and Joseph F. James both controversially challenged this incorrect classification, suggesting the reinterpretation of many "algae" as marine invertebrate trace fossils.&lt;ref name="TreatiseSupp1"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=9780813730271|title= Miscellanea: Supplement 1, Trace Fossils and Problematica | last1= Häntzschel | first1= Walter | editor1-last = Moore | editor1-first= Raymond C. | year=  1975  | publisher= Geological Society of America | series= Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several attempts to classify trace fossils have been made throughout the history of paleontology. In 1844, [[Edward Hitchcock]] proposed two [[order (biology)|orders]]: ''Apodichnites'', including footless trails, and ''Polypodichnites'', including trails of organisms with more than four feet.&lt;ref name="TreatiseSupp1" /&gt;

In a [[novel]], [[theatrical]] [[Play (theatre)|script]], [[screenplay]], [[sketch story|sketch stories]], and [[poetry]], a '''vignette''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-vignette.ogg|v|ɪ|n|ˈ|j|ɛ|t}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|t}}) is a short impressionistic scene that focuses on one moment or character and gives a trenchant impression about that character, an idea, setting, and/or object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca/2010/02/top-10-interwoven-vignettes.html|title=100 Movies, 100 Theaters: Top 10 Interwoven Vignettes|website=100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a short, descriptive passage, more about evoking meaning through imagery than about plot.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/house-on-mango-street/writing-style.html|title=The House on Mango Street Writing Style|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vignette|title=vignette Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[blog]] or [[web series]] can also provide a form of vignette or be presented as a series of vignettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/vignette-in-literature.html | title=Vignette in Literature | publisher=[[Blogspot]] |work=[writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/ Writing in Wonderland] | date=26 April 2011 | accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the critically acclaimed web series ''[[High Maintenance (TV series)|High Maintenance]]'', which presents a different set of characters in each episode, focusing intensely on their specific traits, ideas, and worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/04/10/high-maintenance|title=High Maintenance|website=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2014/11/12/high-maintenance-vimeo/23089/|title=Five must-reads celebrating the return of series ‘High Maintenance’|last=Baca|first=Ricardo|last2=Staff|first2=The Cannabist|website=The Cannabist|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/11/363288754/despite-the-dope-high-maintenance-is-about-more-than-potheads|title=Despite The Dope, 'High Maintenance' Is About More Than Potheads|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/11/11/vimeo-original-programming-high-maintenance/#4008c623f269|title=Vimeo Takes A Bet On 'High Maintenance' As Its First Original Series|last=Huet|first=Ellen|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vignettes are more commonly used and have been particularly influential in the development of the contemporary notions of a [[scene (drama)|scene]] as shown in [[postmodern theater]], [[Postmodernist film|film]] and [[Modern Television|television]], where less emphasis is placed on adhering to the conventions of traditional structure and story development. It is also a part of something bigger than itself: for example, a vignette about a house belonging to a collection of vignettes or a whole story, such as ''[[The House On Mango Street]]'', by [[Sandra Cisneros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/House-Mango-Street-Sandra-Cisneros/dp/0679734775|title=The House on Mango Street|last=Cisneros|first=Sandra|date=1991-04-03|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780679734772|edition=Reissue|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The word ''[[wikt:vignette|vignette]]'' means "little vine" in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vignette|title=Definition of VIGNETTE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name of the literary form comes from the drawings of little vines that nineteenth-century printers used to decorate the title pages and beginnings of chapters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
