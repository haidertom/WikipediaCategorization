'''7:84''' was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[left-wing]] [[agitprop theatre]] group. The name comes from a statistic, published in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 1966, that 7% of the population of the UK owned 84% of the country's wealth (compare the [[Pareto principle]]).

The group was founded by playwright [[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]], his wife [[Elizabeth MacLennan]] and her brother [[David MacLennan (theatre practitioner)|David MacLennan]] in 1971, and operated throughout [[Great Britain]]. In 1973, it split into 7:84 ([[England]]) and 7:84 ([[Scotland]]). The English group folded in 1984, having lost its grant from the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4763110.stm |title=Funding axed for theatre company |work=BBC News|date= 1 March 2006 |accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish group lost its funding from the [[Scottish Arts Council]] in 2006, though Artistic Director Lorenzo Mele successfully secured funding for a further year from April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5292290.stm |title=Reprieve for 7:84 theatre company |work=BBC News |date=28 August 2006 |accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently commissioned a series of four plays, ''Wound'' by Nicola McCartney, ''Eclipse'' by [[Haresh Sharma]], ''A Time To Go'' by Selma Dimitrijevic, and ''Doch-An-Doris (A Parting Drink)'' by Linda McLean. Together, these short plays formed ''Re:Union'', a production which toured Scotland in early 2007. This was followed in September 2007 by [[Raman Mundair]]'s ''The Algebra of Freedom'', which also toured extensively throughout Scotland. This production was directed by 7:84's Associate Director, Jo Ronan, and designed by David Sneddon.

On 31 December 2008, the Scottish company ceased trading, citing "the changing funding structures in Scottish theatre."&lt;ref&gt;Announcement posted at http://www.784theatre.co.uk/. Cached page available https://www.webcitation.org/5pnoU9luB&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, ''abstraction'' is used in the arts as a [[synonym]] for [[abstract art]] in general.

==In the visual arts==
Strictly speaking, it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003405/abstract-art Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;—it can, however, refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed, another work of art. Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. NY/New Haven: The Drawing Center/Yale University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-300-10826-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freedom from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs and shapes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100410114556/http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm National Gallery of Art: Abstraction.] Retrieved 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
In music, the term ''abstraction'' can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of [[tonality]]. [[Atonal]] music has no key signature, and is characterized by the exploration of internal numeric relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714025231/http://public.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ABSTRACT.HTM Washington State University: Glossary of Abstraction.] Retrieved 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12248">[[File:Alois Miedl.jpg|thumb|Alois Miedl]]
'''Alois Miedl''' (3 March 1903 - 4 January 1990) was a naturalized Dutch art dealer, originally a German Nazi banker, born in [[Munich]], who had moved to and was mainly active in the Netherlands, involved with the sales of properties stolen from Jews who had fled or had been deported.

==Early life==
Alois Miedl was born in 1903 in Munich as son to Alois Miedl and Maria Streicher. His father owned a dairy farm. Alois Miedl married Theodore "Dorie" Fleischer, a Jewish girl with whom he had two children, Ruth Marie (born 1925) and Hanns Alois (born 1933). From 1920 to 1924, Alois worked at the bank of Heinrich and Hugo Marx in Munich, and from 1924 to 1929 at the bank Witzig &amp; Co., also in Munich. In 1930 he became a director of the Berlin Schantung-Handelaktiengeselschaft, and in 1932 he moved to the Netherlands as director of Veland, a subsidiary of the Berlin company. At the same time, he was director of a number of companies in Germany and elsewhere. He was an avid mountaineer.&lt;ref name=Iisg&gt;{{cite web|title=Alois Miedl|url=http://www.iisg.nl/ondernemers/pdf/pers-1020-02.pdf|website=www.iisg.nl|publisher=Persoonlijkheden in het koninkrijk der Nederlanden|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haase&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haase|first1=Gunther|title=Kunstraub und Kunstschutz, Band I: Eine Dokumentation|date=1991|publisher=Haase|isbn=9783833489754|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to the Netherlands in 1932, because of his new function there, but probably also because he feared for the security of his Jewish wife in Germany.&lt;ref name=Plaut&gt;{{cite news|last1=Plaut|first1=James S.|title=Loot for the Master Race|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1946/09/loot-master-race/354838/6/|accessdate=6 November 2014|work=The Atlantic|date=1 September 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nazi connections==
Before the war, the Miedls frequented the richest Jewish families in Amsterdam, where they had moved to from Munich in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alford|first1=Kenneth D.|title=Nazi Plunder: Great Treasure Stories of World War II|date=2003|publisher=Da Capo|isbn=9780306820908|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_9sImYb5e1AC&amp;pg=PA26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he was a friend of many prominent [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] leaders, including [[Hermann Göring]] and [[Ferdinand aus der Fünten]], the head of the [[Central Office for Jewish Emigration]] in Amsterdam. He even stayed several times at Hitler's residence [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] in [[Berchtesgaden]].&lt;ref name=Scherphuis/&gt; After the occupation of the Netherlands had started, Dorie was declared a [[Honorary Aryan]]. The Miedls organized [[Festival|galas]] in their home to celebrate [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s birthday, with Miedl wearing an SS-uniform and prominent members of the Dutch Gestapo as guests.&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lopez|first1=Jonathan|title=The Man Who Made Vermeers: Unvarnishing the Legend of Master Forger Han van Meegeren|date=2009|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780547350622|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkT6AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT193 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
Right from the start of the war, Miedl tried to acquire art works from Jewish owners, threatening them that they had the choice between selling to him at severely reduced prices, or being looted by the Gestapo. Many Jews, not seeing any way out, agreed to the blackmail.&lt;ref name=Scherphuis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nicholas/&gt; Miedl not only dealt in art, but also got his hands on other valuables in this way. He also offered protection to some Jews as a form of business transaction, thereby saving about a dozen Jews from deportation and near-certain death. But in other cases, he had no qualms about letting Jewish associates being deported. For example, his two Jewish accountants were transferred to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] in 1943 and died there.&lt;ref name=Lopez/&gt;

After famous collector [[Jacques Goudstikker]] had died when fleeing the Netherlands, Miedl bought his collection of 1300 old master paintings and other artworks illegally, and sold 600 of the paintings to [[Hermann Göring]]. Alois Miedl acquired for himself the Goudstikker estate Oostermeer in Ouderkerk a/d Amstel, where he would live in splendour, and the gallery including [[Nijenrode Castle]] . All of it was bought for 2 million guilders, which was only a fraction of the actual value at the time. Among the pictures sold to Göring were ''Two Philosophers'' by [[Rembrandt]] and works by [[Salomon van Ruysdael]], [[Hans Memling]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Gerard ter Borch]], [[Jacopo del Casentino]] and [[Frans Hals]]. The works kept by Miedl included Rembrandt's ''Young man with a sword'', which he sold in 1944 in Germany to pay off a loan.&lt;ref name=Alford2012/&gt;

He used the Goudstikker name and fame to do business. In return he protected the Jewish mother of Goudstikker, who hadn't fled the Netherlands with the rest of the family and now faced the same risks as all Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe. Thanks to the deal, she survived the war&lt;ref name=Scherphuis/&gt; and acquired the company again afterwards. According to former Dutch resistance member Joseph Piller, who was instructed by the Dutch Army immediately after the war to research the role of the Goudstikker gallery during the war, Miedl used the company as a front to sell looted art to Nazis, and used the profits for the [[Abwehr]].&lt;ref name=Lopez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alford2012/&gt;

From the collection of the Wolf brothers, who had fled the Netherlands, he bought multiple paintings for the Göring collection, including a [[Vincent Van Gogh]], a [[Tintoretto]], and a [[Joos van Cleve]]. For his own, he acquired the bank and the cinema previously owned by the brothers. From Hans Tietje, who was married to a Jewish wife, he bought a ''Madonna and Child'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]. From the Jew Fritz Gutmann, he bought three sixteenth-century silver cups.&lt;ref name=Nicholas/&gt; Other collections he bought include the Proehl collection (which included a ''Venus'' by Cranach) and the Mannheimer collection.&lt;ref name=Haase/&gt;

Another Jewish art collector who dealt with Miedl was [[Nathan Katz (art collector)|Nathan Katz]]. His heirs claimed that the artworks were sold under duress, similar to that of many other clients of Miedl, but this was disputed by the Dutch government, which had recovered many of the paintings from the Nazis after the war. Katz and Miedl had been friends, and no sufficient evidence could be produced to show that the sale had not been voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dutch Holocaust Claim Begs Question: Forced Sale or Voluntary Art Dealing?|url=http://www.jta.org/2007/10/10/archive/dutch-holocaust-claim-begs-question-forced-sale-or-voluntary-art-dealing|accessdate=6 November 2014|agency=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA]]|date=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miedl also dealt with non-Jewish collectors. He bought a collection of 19 old master paintings from German banker Franz Koenigs in 1941: 9 Rubens paintings from it were sold by Miedl to Göring. from the Belgian art collector [[Émile Renders]], he bought 12 [[Early Netherlandish painting|old Flemish works]], including works attributed to [[Hans Memling]] and to [[Rogier Van der Weyden]]. 6 Works were sold to Göring, the other half was kept by Miedl.&lt;ref name=Nicholas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alford2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alford|first1=Kenneth D.|title=Hermann Goring and the Nazi Art Collection: The Looting of Europe's Art Treasures and Their Dispersal After World War II|date=2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786489558|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Cvqr_4Zak0C&amp;dq=%22alois+miedl%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, Miedl bought ''Christ with the Adulteress'', a painting supposedly by [[Johannes Vermeer]] but actually a forgery by [[Han van Meegeren]], for 1.65 million Dutch guilders. He then sold it to Hermann Göring in exchange for an undisclosed sum of money and 150 other looted paintings, 54 of them originally from the Goudstikker collection, totalling about 2 million guilders worth.&lt;ref name=Lopez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alford2012/&gt;

Miedl was also involved in other business and speculation. His most ambitious plan was to buy, according to the source, either the coast of [[Labrador]]&lt;ref name=Nicholas/&gt; or [[Anticosti Island]],&lt;ref name=Plaut/&gt; or both&lt;ref name=Scherphuis&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scherphuis|first1=Ageeth|title=Een heer in de kunsthandel|url=http://www.vn.nl/upload/55461_672_1165929144691-vnnov1990.pdf|accessdate=6 November 2014|work=Vrij Nederland|date=10 November 1990|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have a constant supply of wood for Germany, or alternatively as a foothold to spy on Canada or the United States. It failed when Canada disallowed the sale for fear of espionage. He also was said to have attempted to buy a gold mine in the [[Dutch East Indies]],&lt;ref name=Scherphuis/&gt; and was reputedly involved with diamond smuggling.&lt;ref name=Nicholas&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicholas|first1=Lynn H.|title=The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War|date=2009|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|isbn=9780307739728|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;dq=%22alois+miedl%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1944,&lt;ref name=Nicholas/&gt; Miedl fled to [[Francoist Spain]] via Switzerland. He had in February 1944 sent most of his art collection to the country, together with his wife who he felt was no longer safe in the Netherlands despite Göring's protection. It has also been speculated, based on claims made by SS officer [[Otto Ohlendorf]], that he transferred part of Göring's collection to Spain as well, as a safeguard against the fall of the Third Reich. Twenty two paintings he had smuggled out of the Netherlands, including thirteen paintings of the Goudstikker collection, were confiscated in the port of Bilbao. Although they were reclaimed by the Netherlands, it is unclear what happened to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Irujo|first1=José María|title=España sólo reconoce un "modesto" papel en el robo de obras de arte de judíos|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1998/11/29/cultura/912294011_850215.html|accessdate=6 November 2014|work=El País|date=29 November 1998|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miedl remained in Spain and negotiated a deal with the Dutch authorities, who confiscated valuables worth about 1.8 million guilders, and some 150 pictures left by Miedl in the Netherlands when he fled. Other paintings acquired by Miedl were kept in banks in Berlin, and in Switzerland. The works in Switzerland, which included 4 paintings by [[Paul Cézanne]] and Van Gogh's ''Self portrait with bandaged ear'', all previously owned by French art dealer and Jew [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], were confiscated in 1945. The works in Germany were also recovered and claimed by the Dutch government.&lt;ref name=Lopez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nicholas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alford2012/&gt;

No further trial or repayments were asked, meaning that Miedl was free to keep the rest of his amassed wealth and continue to do business throughout the world. He was estimated to have smuggled some 200 paintings to Spain that were never recovered. He tried to sell a [[Francisco Goya|Goya]] to the [[Prado]]. He planned an auction of the others, and had prepared a catalogue, listing works by Cranach, Rubens, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, [[Anthony Van Dyck]], Cézanne, [[Titian]] and [[El Greco]]. He sold a painting he had bought during the war from [[Émile Renders]], a copy of a wing of the ''[[Braque Triptych]]'' by [[Rogier Van der Weyden]], perhaps made by Hans Memling, to a private collector in Norway in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renders, Émile|url=https://dictionaryofarthistorians.org/renderse.htm|publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1990.&lt;ref name=Lopez/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nicholas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alford2012/&gt;

'''Art competitions''' were held as part of the '''1928 Summer Olympics''' in [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]].  Medals were awarded in five categories ([[architecture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]]), for works inspired by sport-related themes.

The art exhibition was held at the [[Stedelijk Museum]] from 12 June to 12 August, and displayed 1150 works of art from 18 different countries.  Additionally, the literature competition attracted 40 entries from 10 countries, and the music competition had 22 entries from 9 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ninth Olympiad.

The art competitions at the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Games]] was larger in scope than for previous Games.  Instead of a single competition in each of the five artistic categories, awards were presented in multiple subcategories.&lt;ref name=Wagner&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Art Competition 1928 Amsterdam |work=Olympic Games Museum |author=Wagner, Juergen |url=http://olympic-museum.de/art/1928.htm |accessdate=2008-03-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501132439/http://www.olympic-museum.de/art/1928.htm |archivedate=1 May 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judges of the music competition declined to award any medals in two of the three subcategories, and only presented a single bronze medal in the third.

[[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|Art competitions]] were part of the Olympic program from 1912 to 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=In Search of the Lost Champions of the Olympic Art Contests |last=Kramer |first=Bernhard |journal=Journal of Olympic History |volume=12 |issue=2 |date=May 2004 |pages=29–34 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv12n2/johv12n2m.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080410082301/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv12n2/johv12n2m.pdf| archivedate= 10 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At a meeting of the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1949, it was decided to hold art ''exhibitions'' instead, as it was judged illogical to permit professionals to compete in the art competitions but only amateurs were permitted to compete in sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Report on Art Exhibitions |last=Bolanaki |first=A. |journal=Bulletin du Comité International Olympique |issue=27 |date=June 1951 |page=34 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |location=Lausanne |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1951/BDCE27/BDCE27l.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080410082302/http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1951/BDCE27/BDCE27l.pdf| archivedate= 10 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1952, a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games.

The '''art of Newfoundland and Labrador''' has followed a unique artistic trajectory when compared to mainland Canada, due to the geographic seclusion and socio-economic history of the province. Labradorian art possesses its own historical lineage.

While the history of craft and folk art in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] is extensive, fine arts practices have developed primarily since 1949, when the province joined Canada. Prior to [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], the majority of fine art was created by visiting and itinerant artists. Newfoundland and Labradorian art developed significantly after joining Canada, with the introduction of government initiatives.  Since the 1960s in particular, waves of artists have established practices on the island, many with strong roots in the province. Others have been introduced by professional opportunities, residency programs, art education programs, and galleries. An established community of artists is now widely recognized, and creates work in a variety of media.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art in Labrador ==

[[File:Ours nageant (Musée du quai Branly) (3034045389).jpg|thumb|Artifact from Dorset Culture (Collection: Musée du quai Branly)|left]] Labradorian art has its roots in both the aboriginal cultures and the European contact period of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The earliest examples of art in the province were produced by aboriginal peoples, with the oldest known object identified with the [[Dorset Culture]], created around 800 A.D.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/visual-arts.php|title=Visual Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During two centuries of European trader and missionary contact with the Inuit, Innu and Settlers of Labrador, there was minor trade in available carvings and crafts. Moravian missionaries arrived in northern Labrador in the 1700s, and [[Wilfred Grenfell|Grenfell]]'s medical mission traveled in the 1800s to southern Labrador and northern Newfoundland. Mission workers helped create a local handicraft industry that allowed residents to sell hooked mats, knitted goods and other items at North American retail shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/grenfell-mission.php|title=Grenfell Mission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, early Grenfell rugs are considered works of art, and many dating from the late 1800s and early 1900s are held in museum collections throughout North America.&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labradorvirtualmuseum.ca/home/contemporary_art.htm|title=Contemporary Art : Labrador Virtual Museum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, contemporary visual arts began to flourish. This trend was bolstered by government initiatives, the introduction of technologies and transportation, and a shift in attitude toward northern and aboriginal art as cultural and artistic collector items. In Labrador, this began with a Provincial Government rural development initiative called [[Labrador Craft Producers Association]] (LCPA), which was headed by [[Garfield Warren]]. [[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]] was also visited around this time by visual artist [[Bill Ritchie (Canadian artist)|Bill Ritchie]], who encouraged sculpture and printmaking among Labrador's Inuit artists and initiated a collective for the development and sale of visual arts by artists like [[Gilbert Hay (artist)|Gilbert Hay]] and [[John Terriak]]. The [[Labrador Inuit Association]] continued Ritchie's work for approximately a decade, with marketing and promotion of north coast Inuit art. Arts and crafts as an industry were developed by the LCPA throughout the rest of Labrador until the initiative dismantled in 1993. Prior to its demise, the LCPA mounted a major exhibition and video project entitled "Visions of Labrador," which took place in 1991.&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"/&gt;

The Labrador Arts and Culture Centre opened in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/PlanYourTrip/Detail/25080285|title=Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada – Official Tourism Website|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804165348/http://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/PlanYourTrip/Detail/25080285#|archive-date=2016-08-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aided the growth of visual arts in western Labrador. Individual artists and artists' collectives in the Straits, [[Lake Melville]] and [[Labrador West]] began to develop, market and promote themselves in the visual arts. Labrador Handicrafts Inc. and The Birches Gallery stepped in to fill the void left by government and aboriginal associations. In [[Happy Valley – Goose Bay|Goose Bay]], The Birches Gallery mounted a series of exhibitions and promotional events, in Labrador and several sites throughout North America, from 1994 to 2004.&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"/&gt; This, combined with a new initiative in Labrador of the St. John's-based [[Newfoundland and Labrador Craft Council]]'s Labrador Craft Marketing Agency in 1996, provided new impetus for a strong arts and crafts industry. A Visual Arts Association has continued in Western Labrador for more than 20 years, headed by artists such as [[Joyce Channing]], [[Sheilagh Harvey]], [[Margorie O'Brien]], and [[Ed Owen (Canadian artist)|Ed Owen]].&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"/&gt;

Today, a strong community of visual arts and artists work in Labrador, basing their work in a variety of media. Notable Labradorian artists include [[Boyd Chubbs]], [[Robin Smith Peck]], [[Mike Massie]], [[Billy Gauthier]], [[Gilbert Hay (artist)|Gilbert Hay]], [[John Terriak]], [[William Lucy]], George Flowers, [[Derrick Pottle]], [[George Collins (artist)|George Collins]], [[David Terriak]], [[Georgina Broomfield]], [[Emily Flowers]], [[John Neville (artist)|John Neville]], [[Madeline Michelin]], [[Barry Pardy]], [[Garmel Rich]], and [[Shannon Simms]].

In 2016, the first exhibition of art by Labrador Inuit was held at [[The Rooms]] Provincial Art Gallery. Titled "SakKijâjuk: Inuit Fine Art and Craft from Nunatsiavut," the exhibition described the history of post-Confederation artistic production in Nunatsiavut.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sakkijajuk.com/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art in Newfoundland ==

=== Beothuk art ===

[[File:"Sketch IX" by Shawnadithit.gif|thumb|"Emblems of Red Indian Mythology" (sketch IX) by Shawnadithit|left]]
[[Beothuk]] were the indigenous inhabitants of Newfoundland from AD 1500 onward, now believed to be largely extinct due to a contraction in their territories following contact with Europeans. Little documentation exists about their cultural practices. Many Beothuk artifacts were discovered in grave sites during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and include carved bone, antler and ivory pendants intricately decorated with incised patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/aboriginal/beothuk-culture.php|title=Beothuk Culture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another notable feature of [[Beothuk culture]] was the use of powdered [[hematite]], or [[red ochre]], which they used to paint their canoes and other artifacts, and their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/beothuk/|title=Beothuk|first=James A.|last=Tuck|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1829, ten drawings were obtained by Mr W. E. Cormack during the winter of 1829 from the last known full-blooded Beothuk, [[Shanawdithit]], while she resided in his St. John's house. They present articles of food, utensils, implements and emblems used by the Beothuk, as well as scenes enacted on or near the [[Exploits River]] and [[Red Indian Lake]] between the years 1810 and 1823. "Although rude and truly Indian in character," James P. Howley wrote in 1915 (judging them by European aesthetic standards),"they nevertheless display no small amount of artistic skill, and there is an extraordinary minuteness of topographical detail in those having reference to the Exploits River and adjacent country. These latter bear a striking resemblance to Micmac sketches of a similar character, such as I have frequently seen and made use of, when accompanied by Micmac canoemen on the Geological Survey of the Island. There is one notable omission in either, i.e., the entire absence of anything like a regular scale. As a rule, rivers and lakes are greatly exaggerated, and particular features, which may in nature be situated widely apart, are frequently crowded into a very small space; the reverse being just as frequently the case."&lt;ref&gt;James P. Howley, F.G.S., "Drawings by Shanawdithit", THE BEOTHUCKS OR RED INDIANS: THE ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF NEWFOUNDLAND, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1915, Memorial University of Newfoundland &amp; Labrador Website&lt;/ref&gt;

Until about 1900, most art was the work of visiting and itinerant artists. The first known image of the Newfoundland landscape is alleged to have been produced by the itinerant artist [[Gerard Edema]] in the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;Russell Harper, Painting in Canada: A History, 2nd ed. (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1981), pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; known for "painting landscapes, in which he exhibited a variety of scenes of horror, such as rocks, mountains, precipices, cataracts, and other marks of savage nature."&lt;ref&gt;Horace Walpole. Anecdotes of Painting in England. (London: Alexander Murray, 1871), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Topographic drawings and watercolours by naval and military officers were the prevalent art form until the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as [[William Eagar]] attempted to teach picturesque painting while in Newfoundland, but his efforts to promote the "new" branch of art were met with very little interest.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra E. Carter, William H. Eagar: "Sensibilities of No Common Order" Masters thesis (Concordia University Fine Arts Department, 1979), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, the artist [[J.W. Nichols]] composed an instructional article for the public in the Newfoundland Quarterly on "Recreative Art," which provided guidelines for amateurs wishing to explore Nature by painting its beauty.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Nichols, "Recreative Art," The Newfoundland Quarterly, vol 2, 1902-1903, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Newfoundland-born artists such as [[Maurice Galbraith Cullen|Maurice Cullen]] and [[Robert Pilot]] traveled to Europe to study art with prominent ateliers.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 20th century brought visiting artists such as [[Rockwell Kent]], and [[Eliot O'Hara]] to Newfoundland. Members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] came to the island on numerous occasions, drawn to its rocky landscape and northern topography. [[A.Y. Jackson]], [[Arthur Lismer]], and [[Lawren Harris]] created a number of works during their visits, primarily landscape and rural scenes. [[F.H. Varley]] would provide woodcut landscape illustrations for the first commercial release of Newfoundland poet [[E. J. Pratt]], titled "Newfoundland Verse" (1923).&lt;ref&gt;Northrup Frye, Preface to The Bush Garden: Essays on the Canadian Imagination (Toronto: House of Anansi Press, 1971), p. i-iv&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable artists in the 1930s include [[Rhoda Dawson]], who arrived in 1930 to be a design instructor with the Grenfell mission until 1933, returning in 1934 from England to teach at [[Payne's Cove]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Neary, Explanatory material for Rhoda Dawson's "The Wharves of St. John's Newfoundland," Canadian Parliamentary Review, Summer, 1992, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[George Campbell Tinning]] visited Newfoundland as a war artist during the Second World War, returning to paint in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/histoires_de_chez_nous-community_memories/pm_v2.php?id=story_line&amp;lg=English&amp;fl=0&amp;ex=00000723&amp;sl=7678&amp;pos=1|title=Campbell Tinning - The Newfoundland Paintings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local amateur art societies became prominent in the 1940s, particularly [[The Art Students Club]], which opened in 1940. Organized by Muriel (Mrs. A.C.) Hunter, with Harold Goodridge as President, the club grew to 40 active members and 100 associates over 10 years, and featured work of artists from overseas and from Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;"Without a Suitable Gallery, Club Tries to Encourage Nfld. Art," The Daily News, (June 23, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; With no official gallery space, exhibitions were held in various locations. Although none were formally trained, notable artists included J.W. Hayward and his son Thomas B. Hayward; Agnes Marian Ayre; and [[Harold B. Goodridge]] (who worked on a number of mural commissions, including one for the lobby of the [[Confederation Building (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Confederation Building]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]]).&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt;

In 1949, [[Robert Ayre]], then editor of [[Canadian Art]], described Newfoundland's artistic environment as one left largely to "outsiders and amateurs" due to its geographic isolation and small population.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ayre, "Art" in W. Stewart Wallace, The Encyclopedia of Canada. Newfoundland and Supplement, vol. 104 (Toronto: University Associates of Canada, 1949) pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After Confederation: A Cultural Renaissance ===

After [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] joined Canada in 1949, government grants fostered a supportive environment for visual artists. The visual arts of the province developed significantly in the second half of the century, with the return of young Newfoundland artists who had studied abroad. Among the first were [[Rae Perlin]], who studied at the [[Art Students League]] in New York, and [[Reginald Shepherd (artist)|Reginald Shepherd]] and [[Helen Parsons Shepherd]], who both graduated from the [[Ontario College of Art]].&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt; The Shepherds would establish the province's first art school, the Newfoundland Academy of Art, in a house in downtown [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/reginald-shepherd.php|title=Reginald Shepherd|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[Memorial University Extension Services]] and [[St. Michael's Printshop]] in the 1960s and 1970s attracted a number of visual artists to the province to teach and create art. Similarly, the school in Hibbs Hole (now [[Hibb's Cove]]), established by painter [[George Noseworthy]], brought professional artists such as [[Anne Meredith Barry]] to the province.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s saw a significant increase in artists based on the island of Newfoundland. Painter [[Christopher Pratt]] returned to the province in 1961 with his wife [[Mary Pratt (painter)|Mary Pratt]] to work at the newly established [[Memorial University Art Gallery]] as its first curator, later transitioning to painting full-time in Salmonier. Wesleyville's [[David Blackwood]] graduated from the [[Ontario College of Art]] in the early 1960s and has achieved acclaim with his images of Newfoundland culture and history, though he no longer resides in the province. Newfoundland-born artist [[Gerald Squires]] returned in 1969.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt; Other notable artists who developed their practices during this period include [[Marlene Creates]], [[Diana Dabinett]], [[Kathleen Knowling]], [[Peter Bell (artist)|Peter Bell]], [[Frank Lapointe]], [[Don Wright (artist)|Don Wright]], [[Heidi Oberheide]], [[Manfred Buchheit]], [[Stewart Montgomerie]], [[Jean Claude Roy]] and [[Pam Hall (artist)|Pam Hall]].&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt;

In 1975, Peter Bell, who was an art critic in addition to being an artist and gallery administrator, wrote: "There has never been anything remotely resembling an art movement in Newfoundland. There have been successive societies and associations of persons interested in painting, but there has been no group with a coherent style or philosophy, nor has there been any developmental succession from one artist to another. Artists in Newfoundland have been, and still are, isolated phenomena. Distinguished, certainly, but independent and unique."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bell. "Painters of Newfoundland" in Canadian Antiques Collector, vol 10 no 2, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary Art in Newfoundland ===

[[File:L'Anse aux Meadows, The Meeting of Two Worlds.jpg|thumb|Luben Boykov. "The Meeting of Two Worlds" at L'Anse aux Meadows|left]] 
From 1980 to present, opportunities for artists continued to develop, as art galleries such as the [[Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador]] (which later became [[The Rooms]] Provincial Art Gallery), the [[Grenfell Art Gallery]], the [[Resource Centre for the Arts]], and [[Eastern Edge]] were established. Fine arts education programs were established at post-secondary institutions such as [[Sir Wilfred Grenfell College]] in [[Corner Brook]], the Western Community College (now [[College of the North Atlantic]]) in [[Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador|Stephenville]], and the [[Anna Templeton Centre]] in St. John's.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial art galleries such as Bonnie Leyton Gallery of Fine Art, Christina Parker Gallery, Emma Butler Gallery and Red Ochre Gallery, support the work of Newfoundland and Labradorian artists.

In the 1990s, Bulgarian artists came to this province through [[Gander Airport]] as part of a decade-long influx of refugees from the Soviet Block. Notably, [[Luben Boykov]], [[Elena Popova]], [[Vessela Brakalova]] and [[Veselina Tomova]] arrived in 1990. Ellie Yonova would arrive in 1999. Since then, each artist has contributed to the local creative landscape through their personal practices, exhibit design, publications, and public sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lubenboykov.com/about/index.html|title=about|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visavisgraphics.com/about.html|title=vis-à-vis graphics - about us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewalrus.ca/notes-from-newfoundland/|title=Notes from Newfoundland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the Federal Government announced an investment of more than $1.5 million to assist the City of St. John's to redevelop the Tucker Premises in historic [[Quidi Vidi]] village. The [[Quidi Vidi Plantation]] was opened in 2012 as a "Craft Incubator," with 10 purpose-built studio spaces for local, emerging artisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohns.ca/media-release/grand-opening-held-quidi-vidi-village-plantation|title=Grand Opening Held For Quidi Vidi Village Plantation - City Of St. John's|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sound Symposium]] was started in St John's, Nfld, in 1983. Symposia followed in 1984 and now take place every two years. The event brings together a range of local, national, and international artists working in sound, film, theatre, and dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundsymposium.com/about/|title=About - SOUND SYMPOSIUM - CELEBRATING NEW MUSIC AND PERFORMANCE ARTS SINCE 1983|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newfoundland and Labrador's arts community is now recognized nationally and internationally. [[Fogo Island Arts]], launched in 2008 on [[Fogo Island, Newfoundland|Fogo Island]], supports a residency-based contemporary art program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fogoislandarts.ca/about/fogo-island-arts/|title=About - Fogo Island Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 and 2015, the province was represented at the [[Venice Biennale]] as Official Collateral Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadianart.ca/news/newfoundland-officially-accepted-venice-biennale/|title=Newfoundland Accepted by Venice Biennale - Canadian Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Philippa Jones]] became the first Newfoundland and Labrador artist to be included in the [[National Gallery of Canada]] contemporary art biennial after it was reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngcmagazine.ca/videos/shine-a-light-canadian-biennial-2014-philippa-jones|title=Shine a Light: Canadian Biennial 2014, Philippa Jones|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Newfoundland is a malleable idea, constantly being dreamt and reconfigured," wrote author [[Lisa Moore (writer)|Lisa Moore]] in 2016, "All cultures are in constant flux, of course. But Newfoundland, hyper-aware of being a distinct society, is at the same time riven with a kind of archival anxiety to hold fast to defining myths; the stories we tell to bring ourselves into existence. This anxiety might be a symptom caused by existing on the periphery, subject to constant swings in economic instability and geographical isolation in a sublime but rugged beauty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadianart.ca/reviews/what-is-the-new-newfoundland-dream/|title=What Is the New Newfoundland Dream? - Canadian Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, a study recorded approximately 1,200 artists in Newfoundland and Labrador, representing 0.47% of the province's labour force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hillstrategies.com/content/artists-and-cultural-workers-canada%E2%80%99s-provinces-and-territories|title=Artists and Cultural Workers in Canada's Provinces and Territories - Hill Strategies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery ===

[[The Rooms]] Provincial Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador is the major public gallery in the province. The gallery exhibits original visual art, conducts research, educates about art, and is responsible for permanent art collections held in trust for the public. The Rooms provides 10,000 square feet of gallery space for temporary exhibits, normally balanced between exhibitions produced by the gallery and those borrowed from elsewhere. Exhibitions are toured to satellite galleries throughout the province: [[Mary March Provincial Museum]] in [[Grand Falls-Windsor]], the [[Provincial Seamen's Museum]] in [[Grand Bank]];  and the [[Labrador Interpretation Centre]] in [[North West River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.therooms.ca/exhibits/regional-museums|title=Regional Museums - The Rooms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Rooms, St John's NL.JPG|thumb|The Rooms, St John's NL]] The gallery manages several collections, known together as the "Permanent Collections": Memorial University of Newfoundland; the J. K. Pratt Memorial Collection; The Rooms Collection; and the Art Procurement Collection of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador (Provincial Art Bank). Altogether, they comprise over 7,000 works of art, primarily post-1960 Canadian art. Emphasis is placed on art from Newfoundland and Labrador, with major holdings of such artists as [[Christopher Pratt]], [[Mary Pratt (painter)|Mary Pratt]], [[Gerald Squires]], [[David Blackwood]], [[Reginald Shepherd (artist)|Reginald Shepherd]], [[Helen Parsons Shepherd]], [[Don Wright (artist)|Don Wright]], [[Anne Meredith Barry]], [[Marlene Creates]], [[Helen Gregory]], [[Pam Hall (artist)|Pam Hall]], [[Ned Pratt]], and many others.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/rooms-provincial-art-gallery.php|title=The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.therooms.ca/about-us|title=About Us - The Rooms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery began in the university library in 1961. Moving to the St. John's Arts and Culture Centre in 1968, the gallery took on a more active provincial role by organizing regular touring exhibitions to other arts and culture centres. Memorial's Art Gallery became the [[Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 1994, and then The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery in 2004. Over the years, its administrators have included [[Peter Bell (artist)|Peter Bell]], [[Frank Lapointe]], [[Edythe Goodridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/curator-edythe-goodridge-was-called-mother-of-newfoundland/article19482353/|title=Art curator Edythe Goodridge was called 'mother' of Newfoundland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patricia Grattan]], [[Gordon Laurin]], [[Shauna McCabe]], [[Megan Williams (artist)|Megan Williams]], and [[Sheila Perry]].

{{History of Dutch and Flemish painting}}
The '''art of the Low Countries''' consists of [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[printmaking]], [[pottery]] and other forms of [[visual art]] produced in the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Low Countries]], and since the 19th century in [[Belgium]] in the [[southern Netherlands]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the north. 

From the late Middle Ages until about 1700 the Low Countries were a leading force in the art of northern Europe, thereafter becoming less important. In the earlier [[High Middle Ages]] [[Mosan art]], from an area partly in the Low Countries, had had a similar role.
  
The art of the Low Countries includes the traditions of [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and the [[Renaissance in the Low Countries]], before the political separation of the region.  After the separation, a protracted process lasting [[Eighty Years' War|between 1568 and 1648]], [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] in the north and [[Flemish Baroque painting]], especially the art of [[Peter Paul Rubens]], were the cornerstones of art.  

==Early Netherlandish==
{{main|Early Netherlandish painting}}

Early Netherlandish art includes those artists who were active during the 15th and early 16th centuries in the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Low Countries]], especially in the flourishing cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]]. It begins approximately with the careers of [[Robert Campin]] and [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]] and [[Jan van Eyck]] around 1400 and ends with [[Gerard David]] about 1520. Other major figures include [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Hugo van der Goes]], and [[Petrus Christus]].&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Panofsky, ''Early Netherlandish Painting''. London: Harper Collins (1971), ''passim.'' {{ISBN|0-06-430002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pieter Brueghel the Elder - The Dutch Proverbs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'', 1559]]

==Renaissance and Mannerism==
{{main|Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting}}
The 16th century was a period of response to [[Italian Renaissance art]] and the development of several distinctly Netherlandish themes. At the start of the century [[Hieronymus Bosch]] painted fantastic images, often for courtly viewers, that left a long legacy. [[Jan Mabuse]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] and [[Frans Floris]] were all instrumental in adopting Italian models and incorporating them into their own artistic language. The spread of [[Mannerism]] throughout Europe produced important forms of [[Northern Mannerist]] art in the Low Countries. Finally, [[Joachim Patinir]] was a recognized innovator of [[landscape painting]], while [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and [[Pieter Aertsen]] helped establish [[genre painting]] as a popular subject matter.

==Baroque and classicism==
[[File:Adriaen Brouwer - The Bitter Potion - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Adriaen Brouwer, ''The Bitter Tonic'', [[Städel|Städelsches Kunstinstitut und Städtische Galerie]], Frankfurt am Main. Oil on oak, 48 x 36 cm. Adriaen Brouwer worked in both the northern and southern Netherlands and reflects shared artistic tendencies.&lt;ref name="vlieghe"&gt;Hans Vlieghe, "Flemish Art, Does It Really Exist?," ''Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 26 (1998), pp. 194–196.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{For|painting in the [[Dutch Republic]] and [[Southern Netherlands]], respectively|Dutch Golden Age painting|Flemish Baroque painting}}
The 17th century was a period dominated by the distinct individuals [[Peter Paul Rubens]] in the [[Southern Netherlands]] and [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] in the newly independent Dutch Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Mariët Westermann, "After Iconography and Iconoclasm: Current Research in Netherlandish Art, 1566-1700," ''The Art Bulletin'', vol. 84 (Jun., 2002), pp. 351-372, esp. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch and Flemish painters both followed many of the same themes, including [[still life]], genre, [[landscape painting|landscape]], [[portrait painting|portraiture]] and [[classicism]]. Other artistic tendencies clearly differentiated art in the south from the north: the [[Counter-Reformation]], which spurred on patronage for large [[altarpiece]]s in the south, was absent from the Dutch Republic, while Flemish painting did not see the development of the types of calm, single-figure genre paintings championed by the likes of [[Jan Vermeer]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe" /&gt;

==1700–1830==
The most famous painter from the region in the late 17th and early 18th century is [[Antoine Watteau]], whose hometown of [[Valenciennes]] had been annexed by [[France]] a decade before he was born. Otherwise, few painters from about 1700 until the end of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1830 have been incorporated into the art historical discourse.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Montias, "Socio-Economic Aspects of Netherlandish Art from the Fifteenth to the Seventeenth Century: A Survey," ''The Art Bulletin'', vol. 72, (Sep., 1990), pp. 358-373, esp. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zirka Zaremba Filipczak, ''Picturing Art in Antwerp'', 1550-1700. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press (1987): 177–201. {{ISBN|0-691-04047-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch painters such as [[Jacob de Wit]] adopted a lofty [[Rococo]] style, indebted somewhat to Rubens, for ceiling decorations, but there was little work available.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Slive, ''Dutch Painting 1600-1800'', New Haven, Conn: [[Yale University Press]] (1995), 304–305 {{ISBN|0-300-06418-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other painters, such as [[Cornelis Troost]], looked to [[England]] and especially the works of [[William Hogarth]], for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, ''op. cit.'',  310–312.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After 1830==
Art after 1830 in Belgium and the Netherlands follow separate paths as the countries further develop their own identities. [[James Ensor]] is an important figure from Belgium, while [[Vincent van Gogh]], from the Netherlands, posthumously reached the level of modern [[superstar]] painter.

'''BookCrossing''' (also '''BC''', '''BCing''' or '''BXing''') is defined as "the practice of leaving a [[book]] in a [[public place]] to be picked up and read by others, who then do likewise." The term is derived from bookcrossing.com, a free online book club which was founded to encourage the practice, aiming to "make the whole world a library."

The "crossing" or exchanging of books may take any of a number of forms, including wild-releasing books in public, direct swaps with other members of the websites, or "book rings" in which books travel in a set order to participants who want to read a certain book. The community aspect of BookCrossing.com has grown and expanded in ways that were not expected at the outset, in the form of blog or forum discussions, mailing lists and annual conventions throughout the world.

==History==
Leaving reading materials in public places when no longer needed has long been a silent means of communication and sociability amongst bibliophiles.  Ron Hornbaker conceived the idea for what is now known as BookCrossing in March 2001&lt;ref name="sitesay"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2002-09-11-book-crossing_x.htm|title=Site Says 'If you Love a Book, Set it Free'|accessdate=2008-03-27|date=2002-09-11|author=Dan Nephin|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enlisted business partners and co-founders Bruce and Heather Pedersen&lt;ref name="bookcrossing-official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookcrossing.com/management|title=BookCrossing.com Management|author=BookCrossing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to launch BookCrossing.com on April 21, 2001.&lt;ref name="bookcrossing-init"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookcrossing.com/faqs|title=BookCrossing.com FAQs|author=BookCrossing.com|accessdate=2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years the website had over 113,000 members and by 2004 it was prominent enough to be referenced in an episode of the [[Australia]]n [[soap opera]] ''[[Neighbours]]''.&lt;ref name="neighbours"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bookcrossing.com/forum/5/1333159|title=tv show neighbours promotes bookcrossing|accessdate=2008-04-04|date=2004-11-15|author='mattster27'|work=bookcrossing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year it appeared as a new word in the ''[[Concise Oxford Dictionary]],''&lt;ref name="coed"&gt;{{cite book | title=Concise Oxford English Dictionary| last=Soanes| first=Catherine|author2=Angus Stevenson| year=2006| publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; although as of 2017 only [[Collins Dictionary|Collins]] of the major online dictionaries retained it as a word.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/bookcrossing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;filter=dictionary&amp;query=bookcrossing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macmillandictionary.com/spellcheck/british/?q=bookcrossing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.cambridge.org/spellcheck/english/?q=bookcrossing&lt;/ref&gt; Membership surpassed 1,000,000 by March 2012 and the registered book count exceeded 8,500,000. By 2017, there were over 1.7 million members and over 11.7 million books travelling through 132 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bookcrossing.com/about|title=About Book Crossing Popularity|accessdate=2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007 [[Singapore]] became the first country to give the practice official status, designating 2,000 locations in the country as 'hotspots', similar to Official BookCrossing Zones, in an initiative launched with the [[National Library, Singapore|National Library of Singapore]].&lt;ref name="sing"&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/285965/1/.html|title=Singapore is First BookCrossing Country in the World|accessdate=2008-03-28|date=2007-07-03|author=Foo Xiao Xuan|work=Singapore News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's first official International BookCrossing Day took place on 21 April 2014.

===Awards===
In May 2005 BookCrossing.com won two People's Voice awards in the [[Webby Awards]] for best community website and best social/networking website.&lt;ref name="webbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bookcrossing.com/newscontent/137 |title=9th Annual Webby Awards: BookCrossing.com Named Best Community Website and Best Social/Networking Website in the People's Voice Awards |accessdate=2008-03-28 |date=2005-05-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324082714/http://www.bookcrossing.com/newscontent/137 |archivedate=2008-03-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; BookCrossing was also featured in a [[BBC Radio]] project broadcast as 84 Book Crossing Road, which involved releasing 84 copies of [[Helene Hanff]]'s book ''[[84 Charing Cross Road]]'' around the world.  The programme was nominated for a [[Sony Radio Academy Awards|Sony Radio Academy Award]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="sraa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioawards.org/winners/?category=The_Feature_Award&amp;year=2006|title=Sony  Radio Academy Awards|accessdate=2008-03-28|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
[[File:BookCrossingBefore.JPG|thumb|Books are "set free" into public places...]]
Anyone who wishes to officially participate in "releasing" books, whether leaving it in a public place or passing it on to a friend, may register on the BookCrossing.com website,&lt;ref name="freec"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/16/sv_freeculture.xml|title=Free Culture| accessdate=2008-03-28| date=2008-03-16| work=The Telegraph | location=London | first1=Horatia | last1=Harrod | first2=Marianna | last2=Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is the option to remain anonymous when "catching" or recording the find of a book. BookCrossing.com users can 'go hunting', where a member will go to the website to view a list of books that have recently been "released", then go to the location it was left to "catch" it. Books may also be left at "Official BookCrossing Zones" (OBCZs), which are located in certain coffee shops, cafes, restaurants and other public places. The purpose of these locations is to get current members in the area to leave books to share with the public. This also advertises BookCrossing and creates more members.&lt;ref name="spi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/books/138088_bookcrossing05.html|title=Readers are Leaving a Trail of Free Books All Over the Place|accessdate=2008-03-27|date=2003-09-05|author=Rebekah Denn|work=The Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conventions and unconventions===
There is a BookCrossing anniversary convention every April,&lt;ref name="con"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookcrossing.com/convention|title=BookCrossing - Conventions|accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; where BookCrossers go to enjoy organized literary-related events and release books together. The location of the convention changes each year: Here is a list of past and forthcoming conventions:

===Controversy and criticism===
In 2003, BookCrossing was criticized by the astrologer and novelist Jessica Adams, who claimed that books were being "[[devalued]]" by the website as BookCrossing could lead to lower sales of books and, therefore, the reduction in [[royalties]] being paid to authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/books/if-authors-love-books-then-they-should-set-them-free-1-1293703|title=If Authors Love Books, then they Should Set Them Free|last=Crummey| first=Andrey| date=2003-09-13|work=Scotland On Sunday |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most BookCrossers dispute this argument, however. They claim that the website introduces readers to authors and genres that they have not read before, that the website encourages more people to take up or reclaim reading as a [[hobby]], and that some members, having read a book that they have enjoyed, will buy extra copies to distribute through BookCrossing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.bookcrossing.com/faqs| title=BookCrossing - Frequently Asked Questions| accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, Caroline Martin, [[managing director]] of the [[publishers|publisher]] Harper Press, said in a speech that "book publishing as a whole has its very own potential Napster crisis in the growing practice of bookcrossing".&lt;ref name="anov"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/10/16/cclife16.xml|title=A Novel Idea Has Led to Best-Sellers Turning up in the Strangest of Places|accessdate=2008-03-27|date=2006-10-15|author=Andrew Cave|work=The Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BookCrossers rebutted the link to Napster, saying that while music filesharing involves duplicating audio files countless times, BookCrossing doesn't involve duplicating books (and also does not involve violating copyright, as books can be sold or given away freely without permission of the publisher being needed). The founder of BookCrossing, Ron Hornbaker, originally wondered if people would make this comparison when BookCrossing was first launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2003/feb/20/books.shopping|title=Finders Keepers|accessdate=2008-03-27|date=2003-02-20|author=Clint Witchalls|work=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ceri Giraldus Richards''', [[CBE]] (6 June 1903 &amp;ndash; 9 November 1971) was a Welsh painter, print-maker and maker of [[reliefs]].&lt;ref name=Chilvers/&gt;

==Biography==
Richards was born in 1903 in the village of [[Dunvant]], near [[Swansea]], the son of Thomas Coslett Richards and Sarah Richards (born Jones). He and his younger brother and sister, Owen and Esther, were brought up in a highly cultured, working-class environment. His mother came from a family of craftsmen; his father, an employee of a tinplate foundry in [[Gowerton]], was active in the local church, wrote poetry in Welsh and English and for many years conducted the Dunvant Excelsior Male Voice Choir. All three children were taught to play the piano, and became familiar with the works of Bach and Handel in the cycle of Christian celebration. In later years music would be an important stimulus to Richards's painting - as would his youthful sensitivity to the landscapes of [[Gower Peninsula|Gower]] and the cycles of nature.

At [[Gowerton Comprehensive School|Gowerton Intermediate School]] he drew constantly and won local competitions. When he left school to become apprenticed to a firm of electricians in Swansea, he devoted his evenings to studying engineering draughtsmanship at [[Swansea Metropolitan University|Swansea College of Technology]] and  drawing at the Swansea College of Art (now part of  [[Swansea Metropolitan University]]).

In 1921, at the age of 18, Richards enrolled full-time at the Swansea College of Art, then under the direction of [[William Grant Murray]]. During his time at the College he spent less time in painting than in drawing from classical casts and studying industrial design and graphics. The strongest impact on him during these years appears to have been the week's summer school in 1923, which he spent under the direction of Hugh Blaker at [[Gregynog Hall]], the country house of [[Gwendoline Davies|Gwendoline]] and [[Margaret Davies]], where he first saw the canvases of [[Renoir]], [[Van Gogh]], [[Monet]], [[Cézanne]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]] and [[Daumier]], the sculpture of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and sheets of old-master and modern drawings. The experience confirmed him in his vocation; and in the same year he applied for, and won, a scholarship to study in London at the [[Royal College of Art]].

Richards entered the [[Royal College of Art]] in 1924.

Afterwards Richards spent most of his life in London, apart from a period teaching art in [[Cardiff]], where he was head of painting at [[Cardiff School of Art &amp; Design|Cardiff School of Art]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Chilvers&gt;{{Citation|editor=Ian Chilvers, John Glaves-Smith |title=A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwf6RVGYLjgC&amp;pg=PT1434&amp;dq=%22Cardiff+School+of+Art%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xQ3LUqDWJcmL7Aa6j4GIAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Cardiff%20School%20of%20Art%22&amp;f=false |place= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |pages= |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-199239665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 he married [[Frances Richards (British artist)|Frances Clayton]], a fellow artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frances Richards biography|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/frances-richards-1837|publisher=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two daughters - Rachel (born 1932) and Rhiannon (born 1945). Rachel married the paleontologist [[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Colin Patterson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=69557&amp;back=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work gradually moved towards [[surrealism]] after exposure to the work of [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]].  He was also a talented musician, and music is a theme for much of his artwork.  From 1959 onwards, he made prints for the [[Curwen Press]].  One of the high points of his career was the [[Venice Biennale]] of 1962, where he was a prizewinner.

Richards died in London on 9 November 1971.

Many of his works are in the [[Tate Britain]] collection.&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceri Richards biography|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/ceri-richards-1836|publisher=Tate|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Glynn Vivian Art Gallery]] in Swansea also holds a collection (where Richards' first solo exhibition took place in 1930).  Good examples of his work are also to be found in the gallery of the [[National Museum Cardiff]] and the [[Pallant House Gallery]], [[Chichester]].

He designed [[stained glass windows]] for [[Derby Cathedral]] (1964-5), and for the Blessed Sacrament Chapel of [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral]] (1965).&lt;ref name="Ceri Richards"/&gt;

A '''colour trade mark''' (or '''color trademark''', see [[spelling differences]]) is a [[non-conventional trademark|non-conventional]] [[trade mark]] where at least one [[color|colour]] is used to perform the trade mark function of uniquely identifying the commercial origin of products or services. 

In recent times colours have been increasingly used as trade marks in the [[marketplace]]. However, it has traditionally been difficult to protect colours as trademarks through registration, as a colour as such was not considered to be a distinctive 'trademark'. This issue was addressed by the [[World Trade Organization]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]],{{ref|TRIPs}} which broadened the legal definition of trademark to encompass "any sign...capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings" (article 15(1)).

Despite the recognition which must be accorded to colour trade marks in most countries, the ''graphical representation'' of such marks sometimes constitutes a problem for trademark owners seeking to protect their marks, and different countries have different methods for dealing with this issue.

This category of trade marks is distinguished from conventional (word or logo) trade marks that feature a specific colour or combination of colours; the latter category of trade marks present different legal issues.

In the [[European Union]], Article 4 of ''Council Regulation (EC) No. 40-94'' of 20 December 1993 ("signs of which a [[Community Trade Mark]] may consist") relevantly states that any CTM may consist of "any signs capable of being represented graphically...provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings". In Libertel Groep v Benelux Merkenbureau (case C-104/01)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copat.de/markenformen/c-104_01en.pdf|format=PDF|title=(Trade marks - Approximation of laws - Directive 89/104/EEC - Signs capable of constituting a trade mark- Distinctive character - Colour per se - Orange) |publisher=Copat.de|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; dated May 6, 2003 the ECJ repeats the criteria from Sieckmann v German Patent Office (case C-273/00)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copat.de/markenformen/C-273-00EN.pdf|format=PDF|title=(Trade marks - Approximation of laws - Directive 89/104/EEC - Signs of which a trade mark may consist - Distinctive character and graphic representability - Unsuitability of olfactory signs as trade marks)|publisher=Copat.de|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that graphical representation preferably means by images, lines or characters, and that the representation must be clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective.

This definition generally encompasses colour marks, and therefore an applicant for a CTM or a national trademark in the EC may define their colour trademark using an international colour code such as [[RAL (color space system)|RAL]] or [[Pantone]]. In most cases, a colour trademark will be registered only after an enhanced distinctiveness through use in the EC has been proved.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], trade marks consisting of colours or combinations of colours can be registered. However, an applicant's ability to register colour trade marks is limited by several considerations, in line with European Union jurisprudence. Thus, for example, while a trade mark described simply as a colour is registrable, a trade mark described as consisting "predominantly" of a particular colour is not. In a recent case, the High Court of Justice, Court of Chancery held that an application to register such a trade mark was permissible in ''[[Société des Produits Nestlé S.A. v. Cadbury UK Limited]]'' (2012), but on appeal the Court of Appeal reversed the decision in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/04/cadbury-dairy-milk-purple-trademark-blocked&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the United States Court of Appeals ruled in 1985 that [[Owens Corning]] had the right to prevent competitors from using the colour [[pink]] in their insulation products, thus making Owens Corning the first company in the United States to trademark a colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.colormatters.com/color-and-marketing/color-branding-legal-rights | title=Color Branding &amp; Trademark Rights | work=Color Matters | accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, the United States Supreme Court further acknowledged that a colour could be used as a trademark in the case of ''[[Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., Inc.]]'', 514 U.S. 159 (1995).
The trademark owner must show that the trademark colour has acquired substantial distinctiveness, and the colour indicates source of the goods to which it is applied.

====Functionality bar====
The Lanham Act specifically states that "[n]o trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it (e) Consists of a mark which (5) comprises any matter that, as a whole, is functional." {{USC|15|1052(e)(5)}}.
If a colour is held functional for any product, then it is not registrable or protectable as a trademark. 
Several U.S. Courts have dealt with the matter, and colours have been held functional for various purposes.
In [[Saint-Gobain Corp. v. 3M Co.]], 90 USPQ2d 1425 (TTAB 2007), the purple colour was considered functional for coated abrasives, because “[i]n the field of coated abrasives, color serves a myriad of functions, including color coding, and the need to color code lends support for the basic finding that color, including purple, is functional in the field of coated abrasives having paper or cloth backing.” [[Saint-Gobain Corp. v. 3M Co.]], 90 USPQ2d 1425, 1447 (TTAB 2007).
The [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]], in [[In re Ferris Corp.]], 59 USPQ2d 1587 (TTAB 2000), held that the colour pink for wound dressings was functional and not registrable, as its colour resembles human skin and was selected for this specific purpose.
In [[In re Orange Communications, Inc.]], 41 USPQ2d 1036 (TTAB 1996), the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] denied registration for the colours orange and yellow for public telephones and telephone booths, because it confers the goods better visibility under any lighting condition.
Also, the colour coral was held functional for earplugs, because it makes them easier to see in safety checks. [[In re Howard S. Leight &amp; Associates Inc.]], 39 USPQ2d 1058 (TTAB 1996).

====Aesthetical functionality bar====
In addition to the functionality bar, the colour cannot have an aesthetically functional purpose in order to be registrable or protected. In [[Brunswick Corp. v. British Seagull]], for example, the [[United States Patents and Trademark Office]]'s [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] held that the black colour was not registrable for outboard motors:
"[A]lthough the color black is not functional in the sense that it makes these engines work better, or that it makes them easier or less expensive to manufacture, black is more desirable from the perspective of prospective purchasers because it is color compatible with a wider variety of boat colors and because objects colored black appear smaller than they do when they are painted other lighter or brighter colors. The evidence shows that people who buy outboard motors for boats like the colors of the motors to be harmonious with the colors of their vessels, and that they also find it desirable under some circumstances to reduce the perception of the size of the motors in proportion to the boats." [[British Seagull Ltd. v. Brunswick Corp.]], 28 USPQ 2d 1197, 1199 (1993).
Even though there is no direct function for the colour black in this case, protection was denied under the argument that consumers prefer it for aesthetic purposes.

A similar judgement was entered in [[Deere &amp; Co. v. Farmhand]]. Deere &amp; Co. tried to establish exclusive use of its John Deere green colour as a trademark, in order to enjoin Farmhand from applying it to its products. Although the John Deere green colour does not provide any specific function to the good to which it is applied, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa|United States District Court for S.D. Iowa]] "found that farmers prefer to match their loaders to their tractor". Deere &amp; Co. v. Farmhand, Inc., 560 F. Supp. 85, 98 (U.S. Dist. Court S.D. Iowa, 1982). Therefore, if Deere &amp; Co. were awarded exclusive use of the John Deere green, its competitors would be in disadvantage because of reasons unrelated to the functional quality or price of its products.

The '''Crown of Baekje''' refers to several artifacts excavated that are believed to be the royal headgear of the kings, queens, and nobility of the [[Baekje]] Kingdom. Some of the crowns follow the same tradition as [[crown of Silla|Silla crown]]s in that they share the tree-motif and the hints of [[Korean shamanism|shamanistic]] traditions.  However, the diadems of the kings and queens suggest that Baekje people had a distinct tradition for their royal headgear. 

==National Treasure of Korea No.154==
The '''Geumjegwansik''' are a pair of two gold [[diadem]]s that were worn by the king of Baekje.  Designated on July 9, 1974, they are the 154th [[national treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]].  The [[Gongju National Museum]] currently holds these diadems in their collection. They were excavated from the [[Muryeong of Baekje|King Muryeong]]'s tomb in [[Gongju]], [[South Korea]] in 1971.  The diadems were neatly stacked on top of each other and were found placed near the head of the king in the coffin.

The first of the pair of diadems is 30.7 centimeters tall and 14 centimeters in width, while the second is 29.2 centimeters tall and 13.6 centimeters in width. The diadems were cut from thin plate gold which was only two millimeters in thickness.

At the bottom of both diadems is a ring which is believed to have been used to hook and attach the diadems to a royal cap, presumably made from [[silk]]. Based on historical records the king was said to have decorated a gold flower on the back of his black cloth hat. It is believed these diadems would be placed on the left and right or front and back of the royal cap. The diadems would be placed on both sides of the cap and would resemble wings, an important motif in [[shamanism]] that probably represented a belief in rebirth.  

The whole diadem looks like a mass of vines or branches that are shaped into a flame-like pattern.  Flower-like patterns are at the top of the diadem and the lower right and left as well. The flame-like pattern and honeysuckle-arabesque pattern, may have also been derived from Buddhist traditions because of their similarities to the halos of Buddhist sculpture. The diadems are also decorated with many spangles of gold.

The diadem is the first of its kind excavated from a Baekje chamber tomb, because those types of tombs were easily accessible to grave robbers, and gives new insight into Baekje art and the culture of the Baekje royalty.

==National Treasure of Korea No.155==
The '''Geumjegwansik''' ('''Gold ornaments for the diadem of the queen''') are identical in shape and size and were found in the same tomb as national treasure of Korea No.154, in King Muryeong's tomb. They are the 155th national treasure and were designated on July 9, 1974. The diadems were found in the head of the queen's coffin, placed neatly on top of each other.  

They are both 22.6 centimeters in height and 13.4 centimeters in width. These diadems were made by cutting sheet gold. They are ornamented by carving into the gold and the elaborate branch pattern was attached to these plates. Honeysuckle and lotus motifs shape the ornaments and overall shape gives them the impression of a flame. Like the king's ornaments, it is believed that these two diadems were attached to the sides of a royal cap. Unlike the king's diadems, the queen's were not adorned with spangles.

==National Treasure of Korea No.295==
The '''Gilt-bronze Crown from the Sinchon-ri Tumulus''' (''Naju sincholli gobun chuldogeum donggwan'') is from the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period. It was designated as the 295th national treasure of Korea on September 22, 1997 and is currently housed at the [[National Museum of Korea]]. Excavated in 1917-1918, it was found at Sinchon-ri, [[Naju]] at the Bannam-myeon excavation.

The crown is about 25.5 centimeters in height. This crown seems to follow in the general tradition of [[crown of Silla|Silla crown]]s but is notably different as well. The inner crown is a copper cap made from two cylindrical plates. The inner crown is similar to the ones excavated from Ipjeom-ri of Jeollabuk-do Province in [[Japan]] and is evidence of the strong cultural connection between the Baekje and Yamato people. The outer crown has three tree-like prongs placed on the outer band but unlike their Silla counterparts which are highly stylized; these branches are elaborate and ornamental in style.

There is still uncertainty about who the crown is for. It is believed to be for the leader of the region and is unlikely that it was a crown for the king. The crown may have been made from the region it was excavated or sent as a gift by the Baekje king to his vassal.

[[File:Musical Jolly Chimp1.jpg|thumb|right|A battery-operated musical jolly chimp manufactured by Daishin C.K.]]
A '''cymbal-banging monkey toy''' is a mechanical depiction of a [[monkey]] holding a [[cymbal]] in each hand. When activated it repeatedly bangs its cymbals together and, in some cases, bobs its head, chatters, grins, does flips, and more. There are both traditional wind-up versions as well as updated battery-operated cymbal-banging monkeys.

==History==
The Japanese company Daishin C.K. manufactured the classic cymbal monkey during the 1950s to 1970s under the name "Musical Jolly Chimp". It screeched and showed its teeth when its head was pressed. It had a black on/off lever on its back and came with a green arm tag.

Later versions from other toy makers copied the facial expressions but often changed the toy's outfit and name. In the mid-1960s through the early 1970s, the Japanese-manufactured "Charley Chimp" was sold by street peddlers on the streets of lower Manhattan in NYC. Other brand names include "Wind-up Monkey Playing Cymbals" from Russ, "Pepi Tumbling Monkey with Cymbal" from Yano Man Toys, "Clockwork Musical Monkey with Clashing Cymbals", "Musical Monkey", "Magic Monkey","Mister Monkey"  and "Jolly Chimp". There is also one called "Charlie Chimp" from Lincoln, which is different from "Charley Chimp".

With many other companies manufacturing various versions in the United States, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines, the toy's appearance varies. The change in manufacturing countries was primarily due to factories going out of business and seeking the lowest manufacturing costs. This is still the case today. The monkey has been seen wearing red-and-white-striped pants and a yellow vest with red buttons, or red overalls and a stocking cap. Other outfits include green-striped pants, blue-striped pants, a red shirt with either green or blue pants, and plaid blue overalls. The monkeys are sometimes rendered with red rings painted around their wide-open eyes, creating an appearance some find disturbing, perhaps explaining their many appearances in horror, sci-fi and comedy media. They can also symbolize emptiness and mindlessness.

'''Czech art''' is the visual and plastic arts that have been created in the present day [[Czech Republic]] and the various states that occupied the Czech lands in the preceding centuries. The Czech lands have produced artists that have gained recognition throughout the world, including [[Alfons Mucha]], widely regarded as one of the key exponents of the [[Art Nouveau]] style, and [[František Kupka]], a pioneer of [[abstract art]].

The lands now forming the Czech Republic have produced several important finds of [[prehistoric art]], notably the [[Venus of Dolní Věstonice]], a [[pottery]] [[Venus figurines|Venus figurine]] of a nude female dated to 29,000&amp;ndash;25,000 BC, and a distinct style of [[Celtic art]]. For most subsequent periods, Czech art was especially close to [[Austrian art|Austrian]] and [[German art]], and participated in most phases of this. In periods when [[Prague]] was the capital of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], it was a key centre of the current artistic style, using artists of both Czech and foreign origin. This was especially the case for the [[International Gothic]] style of the 14th century, and the [[Northern Mannerism]] of the late 16th and early 17th. After the [[Thirty Years War]], when the largely Protestant Czech lands were returned to Catholic [[Habsburg]] control, a massive propaganda effort by the church has left rich remains of [[Baroque]] art and architecture. From the 19th century, [[Czech nationalism]] had a strong influence on all the arts.

[[File:Meister Theoderich von Prag 001.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Theodoric of Prague|Master Theoderic]], ''Saint Gregory'' 1370, currently in the [[National Gallery in Prague]]]]
The first recognisable period of Czech art is the [[International Gothic]] period, in which Charles IV had made the [[Crown of Bohemia]], and Prague in particular, the centre of power of the Holy Roman Empire. [[Theodoric of Prague|Master Theodoricus]] is one of the first Czech artists that we know by name and is credited with the decoration of the Chapel of the Holy Cross in [[Karlštejn Castle]]. It contains 129 painted panels and is one of the artistic treasures of the Medieval period in Bohemia. A collection of busts in [[Prague Cathedral]] dating to the 1379–1386 depict the benefactors of the cathedral. One of the busts depicts the artist himself, [[Petr Parléř]] the younger (1330–1399) and has been suggested to be the first recognisable self-portrait.&lt;ref name="Story of Art"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gombrich|first=Ernst H.|title=The Story of Art|origyear=1950|year=2012|publisher=Phaidon|edition=16th|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of Bohemia at this time has been recognised and was a key centre in the diffusion of the artistic ideas of France and Italy, spread to England through the wife of [[Richard II]], [[Anne of Bohemia]].

==Baroque==
[[Petr Brandl]] was one of the most well known painters of his age in Bohemia and an important figure of the late Baroque.

===The National Revival===
{{ main|Czech National Revival}}
The [[Czech National Revival|National Revival]], which had its roots in the last decades of the 18th century, led to a blossoming in the Czech visual arts that reached its apogee in the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="History of Czech Fine Art"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Czech Fine Art|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Facts-about-the-Czech-Republic/History-of-Czech-fine-art|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic|accessdate=25 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025103111/http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Facts-about-the-Czech-Republic/History-of-Czech-fine-art|archivedate=25 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artists of the period contributed to the decoration of the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]], which became a focal point of artistic expression of the nation. One of the artists involved was [[Mikoláš Aleš]] who decorated the foyer along with [[František Ženíšek]]. Aleš is widely regarded within the Czech Republic as one of its greatest artists.

Other artists of the national revival included Aleš's colleagues at the [[Mánes Union of Fine Arts]], artists at the [[Association of Moravian Artists]] such as [[Antoš Frolka]] and [[Alois Kalvoda]], and [[Max Švabinský]].

===The Fin de Siècle===
The most important artist of this period is [[Alfons Mucha]]. The work he is most known for is his commercial art from the 1890s which he created in Paris. However, he considered his masterpiece to be the ''[[Slav Epic]]'', a visual exploration of the history of the Slavic peoples of Eastern Europe.

The [[Mánes Union of Fine Arts]] was an important institution in the last decade of the 19th century and lasted until its suppression by the Communists. It was founded in 1887 in Prague and fostered links between Czech artists with the international arts scene. It would later become associated with the Czech Cubist movement.

==20th century==
An important event in Czech art was the exhibition of [[Edvard Munch]] which took place in Prague in 1905 and inspired a new generation of Czech artists to express themselves in new ways, often looking to the international art scene, in particular that of France, for new ideas.&lt;ref name="Narodni Galerie- Contemporary and Modern art"&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection of Modern and Contemporary Art|url=http://www.ngprague.cz/en/1061/sekce/collection-of-modern-and-contemporary-art/|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th-century Czech art===
[[Max Švabinský]] (1873–1962) is one of the most notable artists from the period and his work spans many styles. His early work touched upon the genres of Realism and Symbolism. He designed windows for [[St Vitus Cathedral]] in Prague. He was widely regarded during his own lifetime and he was one of the few artists who was accepted by the Communist regime and was often commissioned by the government for official portraits. However, he was not a particularly political individual.&lt;ref name="Radio Prague"&gt;{{cite web|last=Škodová|first=Alena|title=Max Svabinsky|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/czechs/max-svabinsky|publisher=Radio Prague|accessdate=25 October 2012|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cubism===
{{main|Czech Cubism}}
[[File:Bohumil Kubišta - Portrait of a Man.JPG|thumbnail|left|Bohumil Kubišta - ''Portrait of a Man'' (1911) An example of Czech Cubism]]

An important movement of Czech art in the 20th century was [[Cubism]], the most creative period being 1910–1919.&lt;ref name="Narodni Galerie- Contemporary and Modern art"/&gt; Whilst there were visual artists who worked in the style, Czech Cubism is often mostly associated with architecture, so much so that the art historian Miroslav Lamac commented "Prague became the city of cubism".&lt;ref name="What is Czech Cubism?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Czech Cubism?|url=http://www.modernista.cz/english/ma_czech_cubism.html|accessdate=25 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729013005/http://www.modernista.cz/english/ma_czech_cubism.html|archivedate=29 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bohumil Kubišta]] is an important artist associated with the movement and his work displays many French influences such as the brushwork of [[Paul Cézanne]] as well as the obvious influence of [[Pablo Picasso]]. [[František Kupka]] is probably the most internationally recognised Czech artist from the period and his work continued to evolve past Cubism, eventually establishing himself as an early pioneer of [[abstract art]].

===Contemporary art===

A notable incidence of the contemporary Czech art scene was the work unveiled to commemorate the Czech presidency of the EU in 2009, ''[[Entropa]]'' by [[David Černý]]. The work explores European integration by presenting national stereotypes associated with each member state of the EU, some of which offended many viewers of the work.&lt;ref name="BBC Entropa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Czech EU art stokes controversy|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7827738.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art galleries and museums==
{{main|National Gallery in Prague}}
The [[Czech National Gallery]] is the main institution for the display of artistic creation in the Czech Republic. It consists of many departments which each focus on a different aspect of art. The collection of pre-19th-century art is divided between the Convent of St Agnes, which contains Medieval art, the Šternberský palác, dedicated to the [[Old Masters]] of Western European art, and the Schwarzenberský palác which focuses on works from the [[Renaissance]] to the [[Baroque]] created in the Czech Lands.&lt;ref name="Collection of Old Masters NG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection of Old Masters|url=http://www.ngprague.cz/en/1058/0/0/sekce/collection-of-old-masters/|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main centre for the display of Czech art from the 19th century is [[St. George's Convent, Prague]].&lt;ref name="The Collection of 19th-c NG"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Collection of 19th-c|url=http://www.ngprague.cz/en/1060/sekce/collection-of-19th-century-art/|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moravian Gallery in Brno is the second largest art gallery in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="Historie MGvB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historie|url=http://www.moravska-galerie.cz/moravska-galerie/o-galerii/historie.aspx|work=O Galerii|publisher=Moravská galerie v Brně|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its collection of modern art focuses particularly on the works of artists from the Czech Lands. It looks at both fine art and performance art.

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Description''' is the pattern of narrative development that aims to make vivid a place, object, character, or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Description is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] (also known as ''modes of discourse''), along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[narration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice it would be difficult to write literature that drew on just one of the four basic modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a fiction-writing mode==
Fiction-writing also has modes: [[Action (fiction)|action]], exposition, description, [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]], summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morrell |2006 |p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, [[Scene (drama)|scenes]], and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Selgin |2007 |p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of [[fiction-writing mode]]s and their uses.

Description is the fiction-writing mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story. Together with dialogue, narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes. As stated in ''Writing from A to Z'', edited by Kirk Polking, description is more than the amassing of details; it is bringing something to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Polking |1990 |p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most appropriate and effective techniques for presenting description are a matter of ongoing discussion among writers and writing coaches.

==Purple prose==
{{Main|Purple prose}}
A purple patch is an over-written passage in which the writer has strained too hard to achieve an impressive effect, by elaborate figures or other means.  The phrase ([[Latin]]:  "purpureus pannus") was first used by the Roman poet [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (c. 20 [[Before Christ|BC]]) to denote an irrelevant and excessively ornate passage; the sense of irrelevance is normally absent in modern usage, although such passages are usually incongruous.  By extension, '''purple prose''' is lavishly figurative, rhythmic, or otherwise overwrought.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
In philosophy, the [[Theory of descriptions|nature of description]] has been an important question since [[Bertrand Russell]]'s classical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last=Ludlow|first= Peter |year=2007|title= Descriptions|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descriptions/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''design rationale''' is an explicit documentation of the [[reason]]s behind [[Decision making|decisions]] made when [[design]]ing a [[system]] or [[Artifact (software development)|artifact]]. As initially developed by W.R. Kunz and [[Horst Rittel]], design rationale seeks to provide [[argumentation]]-based structure to the political, collaborative process of addressing [[wicked problems]].&lt;ref name="Kunz, W. 1970"/&gt;

== Overview ==
A design rationale is the explicit listing of [[Decision making|decisions]] made during a [[design process]], and the reasons why those decisions were made.&lt;ref name="Jarczyk, Alex P. 1992 pp. 577-586"&gt;Jarczyk, Alex P.; Löffler, Peter; Shipman III, Frank M. (1992), "Design Rationale for Software Engineering: A Survey", ''25th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences'', 2, pp. 577-586&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary goal is to support [[designer]]s by providing a means to [[document|record]] and [[communicate]] the argumentation and reasoning behind the design process.&lt;ref name="HoAt06"&gt;Horner, J.; Atwood, M.E. (2006), "Effective Design Rationale: Understanding the Barriers", in Dutoit, A.H.; McCall, R.; Mistrík, I. et al., Rationale Management in Software Engineering, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 73-90&lt;/ref&gt; 
It should therefore include:&lt;ref name="Lee97"&gt;Lee, J. (1997). "Design Rationale Systems: Understanding the Issues". ''IEEE Expert'' 12 (3): 78–85&lt;/ref&gt;
* the reasons behind a design decision,
* the justification for it,
* the other alternatives considered, 
* the trade offs evaluated, and 
* the argumentation that led to the decision.

Several science areas are involved in the study of design rationales, such as [[computer science]]&lt;ref name="Jarczyk, Alex P. 1992 pp. 577-586"/&gt;  [[cognitive science]],&lt;ref name="HoAt06" /&gt; [[artificial intelligence]],&lt;ref name="BuBr00"&gt;Burge, J.E.; Brown, D.C. (2000), "Reasoning with Design Rationale", in Gero, J., ''Artificial Intelligence in Design '00'', Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publ., pp. 611–629&lt;/ref&gt; and [[knowledge management]].&lt;ref&gt;Xin, W.; Guangleng, X. (2001), "Design Rationale as Part of Corporate Technical Memory", ''Systems, Man and Cybernetics'', pp. 1904 - 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; For supporting design rationale, various frameworks have been proposed, such as QOC, DRCS, [[Issue-Based Information System|IBIS]], and DRL.

== History ==
While argumentation formats can be traced back to [[Stephen Toulmin]]'s work in the 1950s&lt;ref name="Toul50"&gt;[[Stephen Toulmin]] (1958). ''The Uses of Argument''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; datums, claims, warrants, backings and rebuttals, the origin of design rationale can be traced back to W.R. Kunz and [[Horst Rittel]]'s&lt;ref name="Kunz, W. 1970"&gt;Kunz, W.; Rittel, H. (1970), ''Issues as elements of information systems''. Working Paper 131, Center for Urban and Regional Development, University of California Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; development of the [[Issue-Based Information System]] (IBIS) notation in 1970. Several variants on IBIS have since been proposed.

* The first was Procedural Hierarchy of Issues (PHI), first described in Ray McCall's PhD Dissertation&lt;ref&gt;McCall, R. (1978), ''On the structure and use of issue systems in design'', Doctoral Dissertation, University of California, Berkeley, University Microfilms&lt;/ref&gt; although not named at the time.
* IBIS was also modified, in this case to support Software Engineering, by Potts &amp; Bruns.&lt;ref name="PoBu88"&gt;Potts, C.; Burns, G. (1988), "Recording the reasons for design decisions", ''10th International Conference on Software Engineering'' (ICSE '1988), pp. 418-427&lt;/ref&gt; The Potts &amp; Bruns approach was then extended by the Decision Representation Language (DRL).&lt;ref&gt;Lee, J. (1991), "Extending the Potts and Bruns model for recording design rationale", ''Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE '13)'', IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA, pp. 114-125&lt;/ref&gt; which itself was extended by RATSpeak.&lt;ref name="BuBr00" /&gt;
* Questions Options and Criteria (QOC), also known as Design Space Analysis&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, A.; Young, RM.; Moran, T. (1989), "Design rationale: the argument behind the artifact", ''SIGCHI Bull''. 20, pp. 247-252114-125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, A.; Young, RM.; Bellotti, VME.; Moran, T. (1996), "Questions, Options, and Criteria: Elements of Design Space Analysis", in Moran, T.; Carroll, J., ''Design Rationale Concepts, Techniques, and Use, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates'', pp. 53-106&lt;/ref&gt; is an alternative representation for argumentation-based rationale, as are Win-Win&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Boehm]], Ross, R (1989). "Theory-W software project management: principles and examples.". ''IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering'' 18 (7): 902-916.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decision Recommendation and Intent Model (DRIM).&lt;ref name="Pena-Mora, F. 1993 pp. 213-221"&gt;Pena-Mora, F.; Sriram, D.; Logcher, R. (1993), "SHARED-DRIMS: SHARED Design Recommendation-Intent Management System", ''Proceedings Enabling Technologies Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprise'', IEEE Press, Morgantown, WV, pp. 213-221&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Rationale Management System (RMS) was PROTOCOL, which supported PHI, which was followed by other PHI-based systems MIKROPOLIS and PHIDIAS. The first system providing IBIS support was [[:de:Hans Dehlinger|Hans Dehlinger]]'s STIEC.&lt;ref&gt;Dehlinger, H. (1978), Project STIEC: Systems Analysis of the Generation and Dissemination of Scientific and Technological Information in the European Community" ''Report No. 26: Report on a Batch - Version of STIEC'', Heidelberg/Stuttgart&lt;/ref&gt; Rittel developed a small system in 1983 (also not published) and the better known [[gIBIS]] (graphical IBIS) was developed in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, J.; YakemBegemanovic, M. (1988). "gIBIS: A hypertext tool for exploratory policy discussion". ''ACM Transactions on Office Information Systems'' 6 (4): 303-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all successful DR approaches involve structured argumentation. For example, Carroll and Rosson's Scenario-Claims Analysis approach&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, JM; Rosson, M (1992). "Getting around the task-artifact cycle: how to make claims and design by scenario". ''ACM Trans. Inf. Syst''. 10 (2): 181-212&lt;/ref&gt; captures rationale in scenarios that describe how the system is used and how well the system features support the user goals. Carroll and Rosson's approach to design rationale is intended to help designers of computer software and hardware identify underlying design tradeoffs and make inferences about the impact of potential design interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, J. M., &amp; Rosson, M. B. (2003). Design rationale as theory. HCI models, theories, and frameworks: toward a multidisciplinary science, 431-461.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts in design rationale ==
There are a number of ways to characterize DR approaches. Some key distinguishing features are how it is captured, how it is represented, and how it can be used.

=== Rationale capture ===
''Rationale capture'' is the process of acquiring rationale information to a rationale management

; Capture methods
* A method called "Reconstruction"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; captures rationales in a raw form such as video, and then reconstruct them into a more structured form.&lt;ref name="BuBr98"&gt;Burge, J.; Brown, D.C. (1998), [http://web.cs.wpi.edu/Research/aidg/DR-Rpt98.html ''Design Rationale: Types and Tools, Technical Report''], [http://web.cs.wpi.edu/Research/aidg/DR-Rpt98.html Worchester Polytechnic Institute, Computer Science Dept.], retrieved on 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of Reconstruction method is that rationales can be carefully captured and capturing process won't disrupt the designer. But this method might result in high cost and biases of the person producing the rationales 
* The "Record-and-replay"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method simply captures rationales as they unfold. Rationales are synchronously captured in a [[video conference]] or asynchronously captured via [[bulletin board]] or email-based discussion. If the system has informal and semi-formal representation, the method will be helpful.
* The "Methodological byproduct"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method captures rationales during the process of design following a schema. But it's hard to design such a schema. The advantage of this method is its low cost.
* With a rich knowledge base (KB) created in advance, the "Apprentice"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method captures rationales by asking questions when confusing or disagreeing with the designer's action. This method benefits not only the user but the system.
* In "Automatic Generation"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method, design rationales are automatically generated from an execution history at low cost. It has the ability in maintaining consistent and up-to-date rationales. But the cost of compiling the execution history is high due to the complexity and difficulty of some machine-learning problems.
* The "Historian"&lt;ref&gt;Chen, A.; McGinnis, B.; Ullman, D.; Dietterich, T. (1990), "Design History Knowledge Representation and Its Basic Computer Implementation", The 2nd International Conference on Design Theory and Methodology, Chicago, IL, pp. 175-185&lt;/ref&gt; method let a person or computer program watches all designer's actions but does not make suggestions. Rationales are captured during the design process.&lt;ref name="BuBr98" /&gt;

=== Rationale representation ===
The choice of design rationale representation is very important to make sure that the rationales we capture is what we desire and we can use efficiently. According to the degree of formality, the approaches that are used to represent design rationale can be divided into three main categories: informal, semiformal, or formal.&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; In the informal representation, rationales can be recorded and captured by just using our traditionally accepted methods and media, such as word processors, audio and video records or even hand writings. However, these descriptions make it hard for automatic interpretation or other computer-based supports. In the formal representation, the rationale must be collected under a strict format so that the rationale can be interpreted and understood by computers. However, due to the strict format of rationale defined by formal representations, the contents can hardly be understood by human being and the process of capturing design rationale will require more efforts to finish, and therefore becomes more intrusive.

Semiformal representations try to combine the advantages of informal and formal representations. On one hand, the information captured should be able to be processed by computers so that more computer based support can be provided. On the other hand, the procedure and method used to capture information of design rationale should not be very intrusive. In the system with a semiformal representation, the information expected is suggested and the users can capture rationale by following the instructions to either fill out the attributes according to some templates or just type into natural language descriptions.&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt;

=== Argumentation-based models ===
; The Toulmin model : One commonly accepted way for semiformal design rationale representation is structuring design rationale as argumentation.&lt;ref name="BuBr00" /&gt; The earliest argumentation-based model used by many design rationale systems is the Toulmin model.&lt;ref name="Toul50" /&gt; The [[Stephen Toulmin#The Toulmin Model of Argument|Toulmin model]] defines the rules of design rationale argumentation with six steps:&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Chris (2000), [http://www.concentric.net/~Creyn266/COMM335/Toulmin.htm ''What is the Toulmin Model?''] Paper at concentric.net.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:# Claim is made; 
:# Supporting data are provided; 
:# Warrant provides evidence to the existing relations; 
:# Warrant can be supported by a backing; 
:# Model qualifiers (some, many, most, etc.) are provided; 
:# Possible rebuttals are also considered. 
:One advantage of Toulmin model is that it uses words and concepts which can be easily understood by most people.

; Issue-Based Information System (IBIS) : Another important approach to argumentation of design rationale is Rittel and Kunz's IBIS ([[Issue-Based Information System]]),&lt;ref name="Kunz, W. 1970" /&gt; which is actually not a software system but an argumentative notation. It has been implemented in software form by [[gIBIS]] (graphical IBIS), itIBIS (test-based IBIS), [[Compendium (software)|Compendium]], and other software.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, J.; Yakemovic, K. (1991). "A Process-Oriented Approach to Design Rationale". ''Human-Computer Interaction'' 6 (3 &amp; 4): 357–391.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last1=Rittel |first1=Horst W. J. |authorlink1=Horst Rittel |last2=Noble |first2=Douglas |date=January 1989 |title=Issue-based information systems for design |number=492 |location=Berkeley, CA |institution=Institute of Urban and Regional Development, [[University of California]] |oclc=20155825 |url=http://cumincad.architexturez.net/system/files/pdf/ca71.content.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBIS uses some rationale elements (denoted as nodes) such as issues, positions, arguments, resolutions and several relationships such as more general than, logical successor to, temporal successor to, replaces and similar to, to link the issue discussions.

; Procedural Hierarchy of Issues (PHI) : PHI (Procedural Hierarchy of Issues)&lt;ref&gt;McCall, R.J. (1991). "PHI: A Conceptual Foundation for Design Hypermedia". ''Design Studies'' 12 (1): 30–41.&lt;/ref&gt; extended IBIS to noncontroversial issues and redefined the relationships. PHI adds the subissue relationship which means one issue's resolution depends on the resolution of another issue.

; Questions, Options, and Criteria (QOC) : QOC (Questions, Options, and Criteria)&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, A.; Young, RM.; Bellotti, VME.; Moran, T. (1996), "Questions, Options, and Criteria: Elements of Design Space Analysis", in Moran, T.; Carroll, J., ''Design Rationale Concepts, Techniques, and Use'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, pp. 53-106&lt;/ref&gt; is used for design space analysis. Similar to IBIS, QOC identifies the key design problems as questions and possible answers to questions as options. In addition, QOC uses criteria to explicitly describe the methods to evaluate the options, such as the requirements to be satisfied or the properties desired. The options are linked with criteria positively or negatively and these links are defined as assessments.

; Decision Representation Language (DRL) : DRL (Decision Representation Language)&lt;ref name="Lee91"&gt;Lee, J. (1991), "Extending the Potts and Bruns model for recording design rationale", ''Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Software Engineering'' (ICSE '13), IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA, pp. 114-125&lt;/ref&gt; extends the Potts and Bruns model of DR&lt;ref name="PoBu88" /&gt; and defines the primary elements as decision problems, alternatives, goals, claims and groups. Lee (1991) has argued that DRL is more expressive than other languages.&lt;ref name="Lee91" /&gt; DRL focuses more on the representation of decision making and its rationale instead of on design rationale.

; RATSpeak : Based on DRL, RATSpeak is developed and used as the representation language in SEURAT (Software Engineering Using RATionale).&lt;ref&gt;Burge, J. (2005), [http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/ETD/Available/etd-050205-085625/ ''Software Engineering Using design RATionale''], Worchester Polytechnic Institute, Computer Science Dept&lt;/ref&gt; RATSpeak takes into account requirements (functional and non-functional) as part of the arguments for alternatives to the decision problems. SEURAT also includes an Argument Ontology which is a hierarchy of argument types and includes the types of claims used in the system.

; WinWin Spiral Model :  The WinWin Spiral Model, which is used in the WinWin approach,&lt;ref name="BoKi06"&gt;[[Barry Boehm]]; Kitapci, H. (2006), "The WinWin Approach: Using a Requirement Negotiation Tool for Rationale Capture and Use", in Dutoit, A.H.; McCall, R.; Mistrík, I. et al., ''Rationale Management in Software Engineering'', Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 173-190&lt;/ref&gt; adds the WinWin negotiation activities, including identifying key stakeholders of the systems, and identifying the win conditions of each stakeholder and negotiation, into the front of each cycle of the [[Spiral model|spiral software development model]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Boehm]] (1998). [http://www.cs.usu.edu/~supratik/CS%205370/r5061.pdf "A spiral model of software development and enhancement"]. ''Computer'' 21 (5): 61–72&lt;/ref&gt; in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory (winwin) agreement for all stakeholders of the project.

: In the WinWin Spiral Model, the goals of each stakeholder are defined as Win conditions. Once there is a conflict between win conditions, it is captured as an Issue. Then the stakeholders invent Options and explore trade-offs to resolve the issue. When the issue is solved, an Agreement which satisfies the win conditions of stakeholders and captures the agreed option is achieved. Design rationale behind the decisions is captured during the process of the WinWin model and will be used by stakeholders and the designers to improve their later decision making.&lt;ref name="BoKi06" /&gt; The WinWin Spiral model reduces the overheads of the capture of design rationale by providing stakeholders a well-defined process to negotiate. In&lt;ref&gt;Bose, P. (1995). "A Model for Decision Maintenance in the WinWin Collaboration Framework". ''Knowledge Based Software Engineering '' (KBSE '95).&lt;/ref&gt; an ontology of decision rationale is defined and their model utilizes the ontology to address the problem of supporting decision maintenance in the WinWin collaboration framework.

; Design Recommendation and Intent Model (DRIM) : DRIM (Design Recommendation and Intent Model) is used in SHARED-DRIM.&lt;ref name="Pena-Mora, F. 1993 pp. 213-221" /&gt; The main structure of DRIM is a proposal which consists of the intents of each designer, the recommendations that satisfy the intents and the justifications of the recommendations. Negotiations are also needed when conflicts exist between the intents of different designers. The recommendation accepted becomes a design decision, and the rationale of the unaccepted but proposed recommendations are also recorded during this process, which can be useful during the iterative design and/or system maintenance.

== Applications ==
Design rationale has the potential to be used in many different ways. One set of uses, defined by Burge and Brown (1998),&lt;ref name="BuBr98" /&gt; are:
* Design verification — The design rationale can be used to verify if the design decisions and the product itself are the reflection of what the designers and the users actually wanted.
* Design evaluation — The design rationale is used to evaluate the various design alternatives discussed during the design process.
* Design maintenance — The design rationale helps to determine the changes that are necessary to modify the design.
* Design reuse — The design rationale is used to determine how the existing design could be reused for a new requirement with or without any changes in it. If there is a need to modify the design, then the DR also suggests what needs to be modified in the design.
* Design teaching — The design rationale could be used as a resource to teach people who are unfamiliar with the design and the system.
* Design communication — The design rationale facilitates better communication among people who are involved in the design process and thus helps to come up with a better design.
* Design assistance — The design rationale could be used to verify the design decisions made during the design process.
* Design documentation — The design rationale is used to document the entire design process which involves the meeting room deliberations, alternatives discussed, reasons behind the design decisions and the product overview.

DR is used by research communities in software engineering, mechanical design, artificial intelligence, civil engineering, and human-computer interaction research. In software engineering, it could be used to support the designers ideas during requirement analysis, capturing and documenting design meetings and predicting possible issues due to new design approach.&lt;ref name="DMM06"&gt;Dutoit, A.; McCall, B.; Mistrik et al., eds. (2006), ''Rationale Management in Software Engineering'', Springer pp.1-48.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[software architecture]] and outcourcing solution design, it can justify the outcome of [[architectural decision]]s and serve as a design guide.&lt;ref&gt;O. Zimmermann, C. Miksovic, J. Küster, [http://soadecisions.org/download/SDA-JSS-SpecialIssueWICSA2011v16FinalAuthorsVersion.pdf Reference Architecture, Metamodel and Modeling Principles for Architectural Knowledge Management in Information Technology Services]. Journal of Systems and Software, Elsevier. Vol. 85, Issue 9, Sept. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
In civil engineering, it helps to coordinate the variety of work that the designers do at the same time in different areas of a construction project. It also help the designers to understand and respect each other's ideas and resolve any possible issues.&lt;ref&gt;Whelton, Michael; Ballard, Glenn; Tommelein, Iris (2007) [http://www.leanconstruction.org/pdf/DesignRationaleSystemsandProjectDefinitionIGLC9.pdf ''Application Of Design Rationale Systems To Project Definition – Establishing A Research Project''.] Retrieved on 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The DR can also be used by the project managers to maintain their project plan and the project status up to date. Also, the project team members who missed a design meeting can refer back the DR to learn what was discussed on a particular topic. The unresolved issues captured in DR could be used to organize further meetings on those topics.&lt;ref name="DMM06" /&gt;
 
Design rationale helps the designers to avoid the same mistakes made in the previous design. This can also be helpful to avoid duplication of work.&lt;ref name="BuBr00" /&gt; In some cases DR could save time and money when a software system is upgraded from its previous versions.&lt;ref name="Jarczyk, Alex P. 1992 pp. 577-586" /&gt;

There are several books and articles that provide excellent surveys of rationale approaches applied to HCI,&lt;ref&gt;Moran, T.; Carroll, J., eds. (1996), ''Design Rationale Concepts, Techniques, and Use'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering Design&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; and Software Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Dutoit, Rationale Management in Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''eagle''' is used in [[heraldry]] as a [[charge (heraldry)|charge]], as a [[supporter]], and as a [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]. The eagle with its keen eyes symbolized [[perspicacity]], courage, strength and immortality, but is also considered "king of the skies" and messenger of the highest gods. With these attributed qualities the eagle became a symbol of power and strength in [[Ancient Rome]]. It has been connected by the [[Greek mythology|Greeks]] with the god [[Zeus]], by the [[Roman mythology|Romans]] with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], by the [[Germanic tribes]] with [[Odin]], by the [[Christianity and Judaism|Judeo-Christian]] scriptures with those who hope in [[Yahweh|God]] (Isaiah 40:31), and in [[Christian art]] with [[Saint John the Evangelist]].

==Symbolism==
[[Eagle (symbolism)|The eagle as a symbol]] has a history much longer than that of [[heraldry]] itself. In [[Ancient Egypt]], the falcon was the symbol of [[Horus]], and in Roman polytheism of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. An eagle appears on the battle standard of [[Cyrus the Great]] in Persia, around 540 BC. The eagle as a "heraldic animal" of the [[Roman Republic]] was introduced in 102 BC by consul [[Gaius Marius]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
According to Islamic tradition, the [[Black Standard]] of [[Muhammad]] was known as {{lang|ar|راية العُقاب}} (''rāyat al-ʿuqāb'') "banner of the eagle" (even though it did not depict an eagle and was solid black). 
In Christian symbolism the four living creatures of scripture (a man, an ox, a lion, and an eagle) have traditionally been associated with the [[Four Evangelists]]. The eagle is the symbol of [[Saint John the Evangelist]].

In medieval and modern heraldry eagles are often said to indicate that the [[armiger]] (person bearing the arms) was courageous, a man of action and judicious.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
Where an eagle's wings were spread ("displayed") it was said to indicate the bearer's role as a protector.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In the same way that a [[lion (heraldry)|lion]] is considered the king of beasts, the eagle is regarded as the pre-eminent bird in heraldry. It has been more widely used and more highly regarded in [[Continental Europe]]an heraldry than in English heraldry. For instance, in the roll of [[Henry III of England]] (reigned 1216–1272) there are only three eagles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} &lt;!-- out of how many? compared to how many in an analogous continental roll? --&gt;

The depiction of the heraldic eagle is subject to a great range of variation in style.  The eagle was far more common in [[continental Europe]]an—particularly [[German heraldry|German]]—than [[English heraldry]], and it most frequently appears [[sable (heraldry)|''Sable'']] (colored black) with its beak and claws [[Or (heraldry)|''Or'']] (colored gold or yellow). It is often depicted ''membered'' (having limbs of a different color than the body) / ''armed'' (an animal depicted with its natural weapons of a different color than the body) and ''langued'' (depicted having a tongue of a different color than the body) ''[[gules]]'' (colored red), that is, with red claws / talons and tongue. In its relatively few instances in Gallo-British heraldry, the outermost feathers are typically longer and point upward.

===Parts===

====Head====
An eagle can appear either single- or [[double-headed eagle|double-headed]] (''bicapitate''). On at least one occasion a [[Triple-headed_eagle|three-headed]] (''tricapitate'') eagle is seen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Waiblingen_%28kreis%29] granted in 1957 to Waiblingen (kreis) The three heads symbolise the three former territories that were transformed into the district.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Recursant'' describes an eagle with his head turned to the ''[[Sinister (heraldry)|sinister]]'' (left side of the field). ''In full aspect'' describes an eagle with his head facing the onlooker. ''In trian aspect'' (a rare, later 16th and 17th century heraldry term) describes when the eagle's head is facing at a three-quarter view to give the appearance of depth – with the head cocked at an angle somewhere between profile and straight-on.

====Wings====

''Overture'' or ''close'' is when the wings are shown at the sides and close to the body, always depicted ''statant'' (standing in profile and facing the right side of the field). (''Trussed'' - the term when depicting domestic or game birds with their wings ''closed'' - is not used because the eagle is a proud animal and the word implies it is tied up or bound by a net.)

''Addorsed'' ("back to back") is when the eagle is shown ''statant'' (standing in profile and facing the right side of the field) and ready to fly, with the wings shown open behind the eagle so that they almost touch.

''Espanie'' or ''épandre'' ("expanded") is when the eagle is shown ''affronté'' (facing the viewer with the head turned to the ''dexter'') and the wings are shown with the tips upward.

''Abaisé'' ("lowered") is when the eagle is shown ''affronté'' (facing the viewer) and the wings are shown with the tips downward. A good example is the eagle on the reverse side of the [[Quarter (United States coin)|US quarter dollar coin]].

''Klee-Stengeln'' ("clover-stems") are the pair of long-stemmed trefoil-type charges on the wings of 13th-century German depictions of the heraldic eagle. They represent the upper edge of the wings and are normally ''Or'' (yellow), like the beak and claws. [[Reinmar von Zweter]] fashioned the ''Klee-Stengeln'' of his eagle into a second and third head.&lt;ref&gt;Reinmar von Zweter's peculiar eagle is famously depicted in the [[Codex Manesse]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attitudes (positions)===
{{further|Attitude (heraldry)}}
There is a debate over whether ''rousant'' or ''displayed'' is the eagle's default depiction. ''Displayed'' is more common because it is more artistically pleasing and it fully uses the field's space. ''Displayed'' also predates the use of ''rousant'', with examples going back to the early Middle Ages.

There is also sometimes confusion between a ''rousant'' eagle with ''displayed'' wings and a ''displayed'' eagle. The difference is that ''rousant'' eagles face to the right and have their feet on the ground and ''displayed'' eagles face the viewer, have their legs splayed out, and the tail is completely visible.

====Eagle ''rousant''====
An eagle ''rising'' or ''rousant'' is preparing to fly, but its feet are still on the ground. It is the eagle's version of ''statant'' (standing in profile and facing the right side of the field). 
*''with wings addorsed and elevated'' means in profile with the wings swept to the back and their tips extended upwards. 
*''with wings addorsed and inverted'' means in profile with wings swept to the back and their tips extended downwards. 
*''with wings displayed and elevated'' means facing to the front with the wings spread and their tips extended upwards. 
*''with wings displayed and inverted'' means facing to the front with the wings spread and their tips extended downwards.

====Eagle ''displayed''====
{{anchor|spread eagle}}
The informal term "spread eagle" is derived from a heraldic depiction of an [[eagle]] ''displayed'' (i.e. upright with both wings, both legs, and tailfeathers all outstretched). The wings are usually depicted "expanded" or "elevated" (i.e., with the points upward); ''displayed inverted'' is when the wings are depicted points downward. According to Hugh Clark, ''An Introduction to Heraldry'', the term ''spread eagle'' refers to "an eagle with two heads, displayed",&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Hugh (1892). ''An Introduction to Heraldry, 18th ed.'' (Revised by J. R. Planché). London: George Bell &amp; Sons. First published 1775. {{ISBN|1-4325-3999-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this distinction has apparently been lost in modern usage. Most of the eagles used as emblems of various monarchs and states are ''displayed'', including those on the coats of arms of [[Coat of Arms of Germany|Germany]], [[Coat of Arms of Poland|Poland]], [[Coat of Arms of Romania|Romania]], and the [[Great Seal of the United States|United States]].

====Eagle ''volant''====
''Volant'' describes an eagle in profile shown in flight with wings shown ''addorsed'' and ''elevated'' and its legs together and tucked under. It is considered ''in bend'' ("diagonal") as it is flying from the lower ''sinister'' (heraldic left, from the shield-holder's point of view) to the upper ''dexter'' (heraldic right, from the shield-holder's point of view) of the field. However, the term "in bend" is not used unless a ''[[Bend (heraldry)|bend]]'' is actually on the field.

====Eagles ''combatant''====
Like the [[Lion (heraldry)|heraldic lion]], the heraldic eagle is seen as dominating the field and normally cannot brook a rival. When two eagles are depicted on a field, they are usually shown ''combatant'', that is, facing each other with wings spread and one claw extended, as though they were fighting. ''Respectant'', the term used for depicting domestic or game animals shown facing each other, is not used because eagles are aggressive predators.

====Eagles ''addorsed''====
When two eagles are shown back-to-back and facing the edges of the field the term used is ''addorsed'' / ''endorsed'' or ''adossés'' ("back-to-back").

===Variants===

====Eaglet====
This term is used when three or more Eagles are shown on a field. They represent immature Eagles.

====Alerion====
Originally the term ''Erne'' or ''Alerion'' in early Heraldry referred to a regular Eagle. Later heralds used the term ''Alerion'' to depict baby Eagles. To differentiate them from mature Eagles, Alerions were shown as an ''Eagle Displayed Inverted'' without a beak or claws (''disarmed''). To difference it from a ''decapitate'' (headless) eagle, the Alerion has a bulb-shaped head with an eye staring towards the Dexter (right-hand side) of the field. This was later simplified in modern heraldry as an abstract winged oval.

An example is the arms of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] ([[Or (heraldry)|Or]], on a Bend [[Gules]], 3 Alerions Abaisé [[Argent (heraldry)|Argent]]). It supposedly had been inspired by the assumed arms of crusader [[Geoffrey de Bouillon]], who supposedly killed three white eaglets with a bow and arrow when out hunting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Cadogan Rothery|Rothery, Guy Cadogan]]. ''Concise Encyclopedia of Heraldry''. pp.50&lt;/ref&gt; It is far more likely to be Canting arms that are a pun based on Lorraine / Erne.

==Imperial Eagle==
{{redirect|Imperial Eagle}}

===Roman Empire===
[[File:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|thumb|right|upright|A modern reconstruction of an ''aquila'' on Roman vexilloid.]]
{{main|Aquila (Roman)}}
The ''Aquila'' was the eagle standard of a [[Roman legion]], carried by a special grade [[legionary]] known as an [[Aquilifer]]. One eagle standard was carried by each legion. [[Pliny the Elder]] (''H.N.'' x.16) enumerates five animals displayed on Roman military [[ensign]]s: the [[eagle]], the [[wolf]], the [[minotaur]],&lt;ref&gt;See [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]]on the Minotaur.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[horse]], and the [[boar]]. In the second consulship of [[Gaius Marius]] (104 BC) the four quadrupeds were laid aside as standards, the eagle being alone retained. It was made of [[silver]], or [[bronze]], with outstretched wings, but was probably of a relatively small size, since a standard-bearer ([[signifer]]) under [[Julius Caesar]] is said in circumstances of danger to have wrenched the eagle from its staff and concealed it in the folds of his girdle.&lt;ref&gt;Flor. iv.12&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the later emperors the eagle was carried with the legion, a legion being on that account sometimes called ''aquila'' (Hirt. Bell. Hisp. 30). Each [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]] had for its own ensign the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] or [[dragon]], which was woven on a square piece of cloth ''textilis anguis'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidonius Apollinaris|Sidon. Apoll.]] ''Carm.'' v.409&lt;/ref&gt; elevated on a [[Gilding|gilt]] staff, to which a cross-bar was adapted for the purpose,&lt;ref&gt;Themist. Orat. i. p1, xviii. p267, ed. Dindorf; Claudian, iv.

===Eastern imperial eagles===
[[File:Byzantine eagle.JPG|thumb|left|[[Double-headed eagle]] emblem of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The head on the left (West) symbolizes [[Rome]], the head on the right (East) symbolizes [[Constantinople]].  Relief from the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]])]]
The [[double-headed eagle]] became the symbol of the Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]]. Palaiologos recaptured Constantinople from the Crusaders in 1261 and adopted the [[double-headed eagle]] as his symbol of the dynasty's interests in both Asia and Europe. It represented looking towards the East (Asia Minor, traditional power center of the Byzantine-government in exile after the [[Fourth Crusade|IVth Crusade]]) and the West (newly reconquered land in Europe) centered on [[Constantinople]]. The [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]] has been seen in late 13th century, certainly pre-dating the development of the same in western heraldry.

In [[Russia]] it was [[Ivan III of Russia]] who first assumed the [[Coat of arms of Russia|two-headed eagle]], when, in 1472, he married [[Sophia Paleologue|Sophia]], daughter of [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas Palæologus]], and niece of [[Constantine XI]], the last Emperor of Byzantium. The two heads symbolised the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern or Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Western Roman Empire|Western or Roman Empire]].

The [[Empire of Trebizond]] (1204–1461), one of the states created after the capture of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade, used the emblem of the normal (single headed) eagle. The black eagle on yellow background is still used today in Greece by descendants of [[Pontus (region)|Pontian]] Greeks.&lt;ref name="Kokkonis"&gt;{{cite book | title=Greek flags, arms and insignia (Ελληνικές Σημαίες, Σήματα-Εμβλήματα) | language=greek | author=Eleni Kokkonis-Lambropoulos &amp; Katerina Korres-Zografos | year=1997 | publisher=E.

===Holy Roman Empire===

[[File:Heiliges Römisches Reich - Reichssturmfahne vor 1433 (Nimbierter Adler).svg|thumb|right|Reconstruction of the pre-1433 Holy Roman Emperor's "imperial eagle" flag.]]
&lt;!-- [[Charlemagne]] was a Frankish ruler and the first [[Holy Roman Emperor]] from AD 800 - 814, in days when no '[[France]]' or '[[Germany]]' existed. He had the statue of a black eagle with single head placed on top of his palace in [[Aachen]]. A frequently encountered misquote, mostly by copy circulation on the world wide web is “When Charlemagne was made 'Kaiser of the Holy Roman Empire', he joined the two heads together, one looking east and the other west, thus symbolizing the union of these two powers.” There is no printed or built genuine material left from his time showing any evidence of his use of a [[double-headed eagle]] as his coat of arms. A [[stained glass]] artwork found in a later period church reflects the adaptation of his symbols as artists’ representation expressed much later than Charlemagne’s reign, showing half of the body of a single-head black eagle as the symbol of the German emperors next to a [[fleur-de-lis]] as the symbol of the kings of France in two halves of a shield, as the sign of dichotomy of his reign, and that is not considered a chronologically accurate evidence that he might indeed have used a [[double-headed eagle]] as his crest at his time, see [http://www.charlemagne.net here]. --&gt;

[[Charlemagne]], a Frankish ruler and the first [[Holy Roman Emperor]], died in 814, centuries before the introduction of [[heraldry]]. In later periods, a coat of arms [[attributed arms|attributed]] to Charlemagne shows half of the body of a single-head black eagle as the symbol of the German emperors next to a [[fleur-de-lis]] as the symbol of the kings of France on an [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] shield.

According to [[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]] the first instance of the use of an eagle as an heraldic charge is the Great Seal of the [[Margrave]] [[Leopold IV of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold IV of Austria]] in 1136, which depicts him carrying a shield charged with an eagle. Also from about this time is a coin showing a single-headed eagle,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/duitslan.htm Deutsche Wappen - GERMAN NATIONAL ARMS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; minted in [[Maastricht]] (the [[Netherlands]]), dating from between 1172 and 1190 after contacts with the East via the Crusades.  One [[L'Aigle family|Gilbert d'Aquila]] was granted Baronetcy of Pevensey by William the Conqueror. The family who held Pevensey castle and the newly formed Borough of Pevensey used the eagle symbol in the 11th century.

From the reign of [[Frederick Barbarossa]] in 1155 the single-headed eagle became a symbol of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The eagle was clearly derived from the Roman eagle and continues to be important in the heraldry of those areas once within the Holy Roman Empire. Within Germany the placement of one's arms in front of an eagle was indicative of princely rank under the Holy Roman Empire. The first mention of a [[double-headed eagle]] in the West dates from 1250 in a roll of arms of [[Matthew Paris]] for Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

===French Empire===
[[File:Imperial Coat of Arms of France (1804-1815).svg|thumb|left|190px|[[National emblem of France|Coat of arms]] of the [[First French Empire]]]]
{{main|French Imperial Eagle}}
The French Imperial Eagle or ''Aigle de drapeau'' (lit. "flag eagle") was a figure of an eagle on a staff carried into battle as a standard by the [[Grande Armée]] of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Although they were presented with [[Regimental Colour]]s, the regiments of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon I]] tended to carry at their head the '''Imperial Eagle'''. This was the [[bronze]] sculpture of an [[eagle]] weighing {{convert|1.85|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, mounted on top of the blue regimental flagpole. They were made from six separately cast pieces and, when assembled, measured {{convert|310|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|255|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in width. On the base would be the regiment's number or, in the case of the [[Imperial Guard|Guard]], '''Garde Impériale'''. The eagle bore the same significance to French Imperial regiments as the colours did to [[British Army|British]] regiments - to lose the eagle would bring shame to the regiment, who had pledged to defend it to the death.

Upon Napoleon's fall, the restored monarchy of [[Louis XVIII of France]] ordered all eagles to be destroyed and only a very small number escaped. When the former emperor returned to power in 1815 (known as the [[Hundred Days]]) he immediately had more eagles produced, although the quality did not match the originals. The workmanship was of a lesser quality and the main distinguishing changes had the new models with closed beaks and they were set in a more crouched posture.

Napoleon also used the French Imperial Eagle in the [[National Emblem of France|heraldry]] of the [[First French Empire|First Empire]], as did his nephew [[Napoleon III]] during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. An eagle remains in the arms of the [[House of Bonaparte]] and the [[House of Bernadotte|current royal house of Sweden]] retains the French Imperial Eagle on its [[inescutcheon|dynastic inescutcheon]], as his founder, [[Jean Bernadotte]], was a [[Marshal of France]].

== Eagle of Saint John ==
[[File:VA23Oct10 096-crop.jpg|thumb|200px|Carolingian ivory plaque with the eagle of Saint John, showing the customary halo, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]
[[John the Evangelist]], the author of the [[Gospel according to John|fourth gospel]] account, is symbolized by an [[eagle]], often with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], an animal may have originally been seen as the king of the birds. The eagle is a figure of the sky, and believed by Christian scholars to be able to look straight into the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Male, ''The Gothic Image: Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century'', p 35–7, English trans. of 3rd edn, 1913, Collins, London (and many other editions), {{ISBN|978-0064300322}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The better known heraldic use of the Eagle of St. John has been the single supporter chose by [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella of Castile]] in her armorial achievement used as heiress and later integrated into the [[Coat of Arms of Spain#Historical Spanish coats of arms|heraldry]] of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]. This election alludes to the queen's great devotion to the evangelist that predated her accession to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;VV.

The Eagle of St. John was placed on side of the shields used as English consort by [[Catherine of Aragon]], daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip]] as English monarchs. In Spain, Philip bore the Eagle of St John (single or two figures depending versions) in his [[Coat of arms of the King of Spain#Ornamented versions of the historical royal coats of arms|ornamented armorial achievements]] until 1668.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Olmos, José María de.

Coat of arms of Spain {{es icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the eagle of St. John was exploited by the Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]], who used it as a symbol of his regime.

Prominent examples of the use of St. John's Eagle in heraldry across the world include the heraldry or emblems of: [[Valparaíso|Valparaíso City]] ([[Chile]]); [[Boyacá Department]] ([[Colombia]]); [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Besançon|Catholic Archdiocese of Besançon]] ([[France]]); [[Mallersdorf-Pfaffenberg]] ([[Germany]]); [[Lima|Lima City]] ([[Peru]]); [[Kisielice]], [[Gmina Kwidzyn|Kwidzyn District]] and [[Kwidzyn County|county]], [[Oleśnica|Oleśnica Town]] and [[Oleśnica County|county]] ([[Poland]]); [[Gata, Extremadura|Gata]] and the 29th Infantry Regiment "[[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel la Católica]]" (Spain); and the [[St John's College, University of Sydney|St. John's College]] ([[University of Sydney]], [[Australia]]).

===United Kingdom===
An eagle is present on the official emblem of the [[Royal Air Force]].

===United States===
Since 20 June 1782, the [[United States]] has used its [[List of national birds|national bird]], the [[bald eagle]], on its [[Great Seal of the United States|Great Seal]]; the choice was intended to at once recall the [[Roman Republic]] and be uniquely American (the bald eagle being indigenous to North America). The American Eagle has been a popular emblem throughout the life of the republic, with an eagle appearing in its current form [[:File:USGreatSealGrahamLithograph.jpg|since 1885]], in the flags and seals of the [[:File:Flag of the President of the United States of America.svg|President]], [[:File:USNavyFlag-Official.svg|Navy]], [[:File:Marine corps flag.svg|Marine Corps]], [[:File:Flag of the United States Air Force.png|Air Force]], [[:File:US-DeptOfJustice-Seal.svg|Justice Department]], [[:File:United States Department of Defense Seal.svg|Defense Department]], [[:File:Uspslogo.png|Postal Service]], and other organizations, on various coins (such as the [[:File:COBREcentavosecuador2000-2.gif|quarter dollar]]), and in various American corporate logos past and present, such as those of [[:File:Old Abe Case mascot.JPG|Case]] and [[:File:American Eagle Outfitters logo.svg|American Eagle Outfitters]].

===Costa Rica===
It is used in the [[Imperial (beer)|Imperial]] beer logo.

===Arab countries===
{{main|Eagle of Saladin}}

In [[Arab nationalism]], with the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], the eagle became the symbol of revolutionary [[Egypt]], and was subsequently adopted by several other Arab states (the [[Coat of arms of the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]], [[Coat of arms of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Coat of arms of Libya#Libya under Gaddafi|Libya]], the partially recognised [[Coat of arms of Palestine|State of Palestine]], and [[Coat of arms of Yemen|Yemen]]).

The eagle as a symbol of [[Saladin]] is disputed by archaeologists. The symbol of an eagle was found on the west wall of the [[Cairo Citadel]] (constructed by Saladin), and so is assumed by many to be his personal symbol. There is, however, little proof to defend this.

As a [[heraldry|heraldic]] symbol identified with Arab nationalism, the Eagle of Saladin was subsequently adopted as the coats of arms of [[Coat of arms of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Coat of arms of Palestine|Palestine]]. It has previously been the coat of arms of [[Coat of arms of Libya|Libya]], but later replaced by the [[Hawk of Quraish]]. The Hawk of Quraish was itself abandoned after the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]]. The Eagle of Saladin was part of the coat of arms of [[Coat of arms of South Yemen|South Yemen]] prior to that country's [[Yemeni unification|unification]] with [[North Yemen]].

==Examples==
A wide variety of political entities across the world use an eagle in their official emblems. The variation among them is instructive, in that it reflects connections among various heraldic traditions. The following is just a sampling of these.

'''Graphic communication''' as the name suggests is [[communication]] using [[graphic]] elements. These elements include symbols such as [[glyph]]s and [[icon (computing)|icon]]s, images such as drawings and photographs, and can include the passive contributions of [[substrate (printing)|substrate]], color and surroundings. It is the process of creating, producing, and distributing material incorporating [[word]]s and [[image]]s to convey [[data]], [[concept]]s, and [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref name="GCC08"&gt;[http://teched.vt.edu/GCC/HTML/VirtualTextbook/VirtualArticles/DefinitionOfGraphicComm.html Definition of Graphic Communications] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306143724/http://www.teched.vt.edu/gcc/HTML/VirtualTextbook/VirtualArticles/DefinitionOfGraphicComm.html |date=2008-03-06 }} GRAPHIC COMM CENTRAL, 2008. Accessed 25 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of graphic communications encompasses all phases of the graphic communications processes from origination of the idea (design, layout, and typography) through reproduction, finishing and distribution of two- or three-dimensional products or electronic transmission.&lt;ref name="GCC08"/&gt;

== Overview ==
Graphic communication involves the use of visual material to relate ideas such as [[drawings]], [[photograph]]s, [[Photographic slide|slide]]s, and [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es. The drawings of plans and refinements and a rough map sketched to show the way could be considered graphical communication.

Any medium that uses a [[graphics]] to aid in conveying a [[message]], [[Education|instruction]], or an [[idea]] is involved in graphical communication. One of the most widely used forms of graphical communication is the [[drawing]].&lt;ref&gt;David L. Goetsch et al. (1999). ''Technical Drawing''. {{ISBN|0-7668-0531-X}}. p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest graphics known to anthropologists studying prehistoric periods are [[cave paintings]] and markings on boulders, bone, ivory, and antlers, which were created during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period from 40,000–10,000 [[Before Christ|B.C.]] or earlier. Many of these played a major role in [[geometry]]. They used graphics to represent their mathematical theories such as the Circle Theorem and the [[Pythagorean theorem]].

== Graphic communication topics ==
=== Graphics ===
[[Graphics]] are visual presentations on some surface, such as a wall, [[canvas]], computer screen, paper, or stone to [[brand]], inform, illustrate, or entertain. Examples are [[photograph]]s, [[drawings]], [[line art]], [[graphics|graphs]], [[diagrams]], [[typography]], [[number]]s, [[symbols]], [[geometric]] designs, [[map]]s, [[engineering drawings]], or other [[image]]s. Graphics often combine [[character (computer)|text]], [[illustration]], and [[color]]. [[Graphic design]] may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.

Graphics can be functional or artistic. The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, or an interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred.

=== Communication ===
[[Communication]] is the process whereby information is imparted by a sender to a receiver via a [[media (communication)|medium]]. It requires that all parties have an area of communicative commonality. There are [[Sound|auditory]] means, such as speaking, singing and sometimes tone of voice, and [[nonverbal communication|nonverbal]], physical means, such as [[body language]], [[sign language]], [[paralanguage]], [[Haptic perception|touch]], [[eye contact]], by using [[writing]]. Communication is defined as a process by which we assign and [[convey]] meaning in an attempt to create shared understanding.  This process requires a vast repertoire of skills in [[intrapersonal]] and [[interpersonal]] processing, listening, observing, speaking, questioning, analyzing, and evaluating. if you use these processes it is developmental and transfers to all areas of life: home, school, community, work, and beyond. It is through communication that [[collaboration]] and [[cooperation]] occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Communication |work=office of superintendent of Public instruction |location=Washington |url=http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/Communications/default.aspx |accessdate=March 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual communication ===
[[Visual communication]] as the name suggests is [[communication]] through visual aid. It is the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be read or looked upon. Primarily associated with [[Dimension|two dimensional]] images, it includes: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[typography]], [[drawing]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], colour and electronic resources. It solely relies on vision. It is a form of [[communication]] with visual effect. It explores the idea that a visual message with text has a greater power to inform, educate or [[persuade]] a person.  It is communication by presenting information through Visual form. The evaluation of a good visual design is based on measuring comprehension by the audience, not on aesthetic or artistic preference.  There are no universally agreed-upon principles of beauty and ugliness.  There exists a variety of ways to present information visually, like [[gestures]], body languages, video and TV. Here, focus is on the presentation of text, pictures, diagrams, photos, et cetera, integrated on a computer display. The term visual presentation is used to refer to the actual presentation of information. Recent research in the field has focused on [[web design]] and graphically oriented usability. [[Graphic designers]] use methods of visual communication in their professional practice.

=== Communication design ===
[[Communication design]] is a mixed discipline between design and information-development which is concerned with how  intermission such as [[printing|printed]], [[craft]]ed, [[electronic media]] or [[presentations]] communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the [[message]] aside from the [[aesthetic]]s in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic [[business]] thinking, utilizing [[market research]], [[creativity]], and [[problem-solving]].

=== Graphic design ===
The term [[graphic design]] can refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines which focus on visual communication and presentation.  Various methods are used to create and combine symbols, images and/or words to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use [[typography]], [[visual arts]] and [[page layout]] techniques to produce the final result.  Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.

Common uses of graphic design include magazines, advertisements, product packaging and web design.  For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as shapes and color which unify the piece.  [[Composition (visual arts)|Composition]] is one of the most important features of graphic design especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.

=== Graphical representation ===
The term representation, according to O'Shaughnessy and Stadler (2005), can carry a range of meanings and interpretations. In [[literary theory]] representation is commonly defined in three ways.
#To look like or resemble
#To stand in for something or someone
#To present a second time to re-present&lt;ref name=Stadler2005&gt;O'Shaughnessy, M &amp; Stadler J, ''Media and society: an introduction'', 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, South Melbourne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Representation, according to Mitchell (1995), began with early literary theory in the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and has evolved into a significant component of language, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurian]] and [[communication]] studies. Aristotle discusses representation in three ways:&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995&gt;Mitchell, W. 1995, "Representation", in F Lentricchia &amp; T McLaughlin (eds), ''Critical Terms for Literary Study'', 2nd edn, University of Chicago Press, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''The object:'' The symbol being represented.
# ''Manner:'' The way the symbol is represented.
# ''Means:'' The material that is used to represent it.
The ''means'' of literary representation is [[language]]. The means of graphical representation are [[graphics]]. Graphical representation of data is one of the most commonly used modes of presentation.
The purpose of graphical communication is transfer message or information to the receiver in effective way.when professional organizations prepare reports then usually use the mode of graphical presentations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4087">The '''Guggenheim International Award''' was established in 1956 as "both a recognition of outstanding achievements in the visual arts and an important manifestation of international goodwill".  A shortlist of artists and works were selected by juries to represent different countries, with one overall winner selected by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] and awarded a monetary prize of US$10,000, then the largest art prize awarded in the US.  Prizes were given every two years from 1956 to 1964 (omitting 1962).  The award was discontinued after 1964 in order to divert funds to acquiring further artwork for the Foundation.

{{Intellectual property}}
'''Indigenous intellectual property''' is an umbrella legal term used in national and international forums to identify [[indigenous peoples]]' claims of [[intellectual property]] rights to protect specific cultural knowledge of their groups.&lt;ref&gt;RAINFOREST ABORIGINAL NETWORK (1993) &lt;u&gt;''Julayinbul: Aboriginal Intellectual and Cultural Property Definitions, Ownership and Strategies for Protection.''&lt;/u&gt; Rainforest Aboriginal Network. Cairns. Page 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNDRIPart31"&gt;Working Group on Indigenous Populations, accepted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], ''[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626112013/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement |date=26 June 2015 }}''; UN Headquarters; New York City (13 September 2007): Article 31: "Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a concept that has developed out of predominantly [[Western culture|western]] concepts of intellectual property law, and has most recently been promoted by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], as part of a more general [[United Nations]] push&lt;ref name="OHCRC001"&gt;{{cite web | last = OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS | first =  | year = 2007 | url = http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/indigenous/ | title = Indigenous peoples | format = WEB PAGE | work =  | publisher = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights.

[[Nation state]]s across the world have experienced difficulties reconciling local indigenous  laws and cultural norms with a predominantly western legal system, in many cases leaving indigenous peoples' individual and [[community|communal]] intellectual property rights largely unprotected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hadley | first = Marie | title = Lack of Political Will or Academic Inertia? - The need for non-legal responses to the issue of Indigenous art and copyright | journal = Alternative Law Journal | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 152–156 | publisher = Legal Service Bulletin Co-operative Ltd | location = Melbourne | year = 2009 | url = http://www.altlj.org/index.php?option=Articles&amp;task=viewarticle&amp;artid=69#2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, international bodies such as the [[United Nations]] have become involved in the issue,&lt;ref name="UNDRIPart31"/&gt; making more specific declarations that intellectual property also includes cultural property such as historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, and performing arts in addition to artwork and literature.&lt;ref name="UNDRIPart11"&gt;Working Group on Indigenous Populations, accepted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], ''[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626112013/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/512/07/PDF/N0651207.pdf?OpenElement |date=26 June 2015 }}''; UN Headquarters; New York City (13 September 2007): Article 11: "Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, '''protect''' and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, '''ceremonies''', technologies and visual and performing arts and literature."[bold added]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declarations regarding Indigenous Intellectual Property ==
While a number of [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] communities have issued tribal declarations over the past 35 years, in the lead up to and during the United Nations International Year for the World's Indigenous Peoples (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WATSON, Irene |title=1993: International Year for Indigenous Peoples |publisher=AustLII |year=1992 |work=&lt;u&gt;Aboriginal Law Bulletin&lt;/u&gt; |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AboriginalLB/1992/52.html |accessdate=2007-11-29 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; then during the following United Nations Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples (1995–2004)&lt;ref name="OHCRC001"/&gt; a number of conferences of both indigenous and non-indigenous specialists were held in different parts of the world, resulting in a number of unified declarations and statements identifying, explaining, refining, and defining 'indigenous intellectual property'.&lt;ref name="WIPO002"&gt;WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORGANISATION (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resolution of the 5th Annual Meeting of the Traditional Elders Circle, October, 1980===

Before ceremonies and ceremonial knowledge were affirmed as protected intellectual property by the [[United Nations General Assembly|U.N. General Assembly]],&lt;ref name="UNDRIPart11"/&gt; smaller coalitions of Indigenous cultural leaders met to issue declarations about protection of ceremonial knowledge.&lt;ref name="Rez5"&gt;Yellowtail, Tom, ''et al''; "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/history/elders.html Resolution of the 5th Annual Meeting of the Traditional Elders Circle]" Northern Cheyenne Nation, Two Moons' Camp, Rosebud Creek, Montana; 5 October 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"&gt;Mesteth, Wilmer, et al (10 June 1993) "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/ladecwar.htm Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality]." "At the Lakota Summit V, an international gathering of US and Canadian Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Nations, about 500 representatives from 40 different tribes and bands of the Lakota unanimously passed a "Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality." The following declaration was unanimously passed."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"&gt;Taliman, Valerie (1993) "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/warlakot.htm Article On The 'Lakota Declaration of War']."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 1980, spiritual leaders of the [[Cheyenne people|Northern Cheyenne]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Hopi people|Hopi]], [[Muscogee people|Muskogee]], [[Ojibwe people|Chippewa]]-[[Cree]], [[Iroquois|Haudenosaunee]] and [[Lakota people|Lakota]] Nations met on the [[Northern Cheyenne Reservation]] in [[Montana]],&lt;ref name="Rez5"/&gt; and issued a resolution that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''These [non-Native] individuals are gathering non-Indian people as followers who believe they are receiving instructions of the original people. We, the Elders and our representatives sitting in Council, give warning to these non-Indian followers that it is our understanding this is not a proper process, that the authority to carry these sacred objects is given by the people...''&lt;ref name="Rez5"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Declaration of Belem, July 1988===

The first international congress of the International Society of Ethnobiology involving [[anthropology|anthropologists]], [[biology|biologists]], [[chemistry|chemists]], [[sociology|sociologists]], and indigenous peoples met at [[Belém|Belem]], [[Brazil]]. They identified themselves collectively as '[[Ethnobiology|ethnobiologists]]', and announced that (amongst other matters) since "Indigenous cultures around the world are being disrupted and destroyed.":
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Mechanisms [ought to] be established by which indigenous specialists are recognized as proper Authorities and are consulted in all programs affecting them, their resources and their environment"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Procedures must be developed to compensate native peoples for the utilization of their knowledge and their biological resources"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Declaration of Belem|publisher=|year=1988|format=PDF|work=|url=http://ise.arts.ubc.ca/_common/docs/DeclarationofBelem.pdf|accessdate=2007-12-04}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kari-Oca Declaration and Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter, May 1992 ===

The Kari-Oca Declaration and [[charter]] was first affirmed in [[Brazil]] in May 1992, and then re-affirmed in [[Indonesia]], in June 2002. Ratifying the document were Indigenous peoples from the Americas, Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe and the Pacific who, at Kari-Oca Villages, united in one voice to collectively express their serious concern at the way the world was exploiting the natural resources upon which indigenous peoples depend.

Specific reference is made within the Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter to perceived abuses of indigenous people's intellectual and cultural properties.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henrietta Marrie|FOURMILE, Henrietta]] (1996) "Making things work: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Involvement in Bioregional Planning" in ''Approaches to bioregional planning. Part 2. Background Papers to the conference; 30 October – 1 November 1995, Melbourne''; Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. Canberra. p.235&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the heading,"''Culture, Science and Intellectual Property''", amongst other matters, it is asserted:&lt;ref&gt;FOURMILE pages 260–261&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality, June 1993===

At the Lakota Summit V, an international gathering of US and Canadian Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Nations, about 500 representatives from 40 different tribes and bands of the Lakota unanimously passed a "Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality."&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt; Representatives affirmed a zero-tolerance policy on the exploitation of Lakota, Dakota and Nakota ceremonial knowledge.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Whereas''' ''we are conveners of an ongoing series of comprehensive forums on the abuse and exploitation of Lakota spirituality; and''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Whereas''' ''we represent the recognized Lakota leaders, traditional elders, and grassroots advocates of the Lakota people; and ... ''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Whereas''' ''non-Indian charlatans and "wannabes" are selling books that promote systematic colonization of our Lakota spirituality; and ''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Whereas''' ''this exponential exploitation of our Lakota spiritual traditions requires that we take immediate action to defend our most precious Lakota spirituality from further contamination, desecration and abuse; ...''&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''6.'''  ''We urge traditional people, tribal leaders, and governing councils of all other Indian Nations, as well as all national Indian organizations, to join us in calling for an immediate end to this rampant exploitation of our respective American Indian sacred traditions by issuing statements denouncing such abuse; for it is not the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota people alone whose spiritual practices are being systematically violated by non-Indians.''&lt;br/&gt;
'''7.'''  ''We urge all our Indian brothers and sisters to act decisively and boldly in our present campaign to end the destruction of our sacred traditions, keeping in mind that our highest duty as Indian people: to preserve the purity of our precious traditions for future generations, so that our children and our children's children will survive and prosper in the sacred manner intended for each of our respective peoples by our Creator.''&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mataatua Declaration on Cultural and Intellectual Property Rights of Indigenous Peoples, June, 1993===

On 18 June 1993, 150 delegates from fourteen countries, including indigenous representatives from  Japan ([[Ainu people|Ainu]]), Australia, [[Cook Islands]], [[Fiji]], India, [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Philippines]], [[Surinam]], United States and [[Aotearoa]] (New Zealand) met at Whakatane ([[Bay of Plenty]] region of New Zealand). The assembly '''affirmed''' Indigenous peoples' knowledge is of benefit to all humanity; '''recognised''' Indigenous peoples are willing to offer their knowledge to all humanity provided their fundamental rights to define and control this knowledge is protected by the international community; '''insisted''' the first beneficiaries of Indigenous knowledge must be the direct Indigenous descendants of such knowledge; and '''declared''' all forms of exploitation of Indigenous knowledge must cease.&lt;ref name="FOURMILE page 262"&gt;FOURMILE page 262&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Section 2 of their declaration they specifically ask State, National and International Agencies to:&lt;ref name="FOURMILE page 262"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''2.1''': Recognise that Indigenous peoples are the guardians of their customary knowledge and have the right to protect and control dissemination of that knowledge.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''2.2''': Recognise that Indigenous peoples also have the right to create new knowledge based on cultural tradition"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''''2.3''': Accept that the cultural and intellectual property rights of Indigenous peoples are vested with those who created them.''&lt;ref name="WIPO001"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Julayinbul Statement on Indigenous Intellectual Property Rights, November 1993===
[[File:JulayinbulIP.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Julayinbul Aboriginal Intellectual Property Conference Logo (1993)]]
This declaration arose out of a meeting of Indigenous and non-Indigenous specialists, who, at [[Daintree, Queensland|Jingarrba]], in north-eastern Australia, agreed Indigenous intellectual property rights are best determined from within the [[Custom (law)|customary law]]s of the Indigenous groups' themselves.&lt;ref&gt;FOURMILE page 236&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the declaration, Indigenous customary laws are (re)named 'Aboriginal common laws', and it is insisted these laws must be acknowledged and treated as equal to any other systems of law:&lt;ref&gt;FOURMILE pages 264&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...Indigenous Peoples and Nations reaffirm their right to define for themselves their own intellectual property, acknowledging...the uniqueness of their own particular heritage.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...Indigenous Peoples and Nations...declare that we...are willing to share [our intellectual property] with all humanity provided that our fundamental rights to define and control this property are recognised by the international community...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Aboriginal intellectual property, within Aboriginal Common Law, is an inherent, inalienable right which cannot be terminated, extinguished, or taken... Any use of the intellectual property of Aboriginal Nations and Peoples may only be done in accordance with Aboriginal Common Law, and any unauthorised use is strictly prohibited."&lt;ref name="WIPO001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAINFOREST ABORIGINAL NETWORK Pages 9–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Santa Cruz de la Sierra Statement on Intellectual Property, September, 1994===

A regional meeting was held at [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], [[Bolivia]] where indigenous peoples from the South America's concerned about the way internationally prevailing intellectual property systems and regimes appeared to be favouring the appropriation of indigenous peoples' knowledge and resources for commercial purposes, agreed:&lt;ref name="FOUR02"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''For members of indigenous peoples, knowledge and determination of the use of resources are collective and intergenerational. No...individuals or communities, nor the Government, can sell or transfer ownership of [cultural] resources which are the property of the people and which each generation has an obligation to safeguard for the next.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Work must be conducted on the design of a protection and recognition system which is in accordance with ..our own conception, and mechanisms must be developed .. which will prevent appropriation of our resources and knowledge.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''There must be appropriate mechanisms for maintaining and ensuring the right of Indigenous peoples to deny indiscriminate access to the [cultural] resources of our communities or peoples and making it possible to contest patents or other exclusive rights to what is essentially Indigenous.''&lt;ref name="FOUR02"&gt;FOURMILE 1996: Pages 266–267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Tambunan Statement on the Protection and Conservation of Indigenous Knowledge, February, 1995===

Indigenous people of Asia met at [[Tambunan]], [[Sabah]], East [[Malaysia]], to assert rights of self-determination, and to express concern about, and fear of, the threat unfamiliar 'western' intellectual property rights systems may pose to them.  It was agreed:&lt;ref name="FOUR003"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''For the Indigenous peoples of Asia, the intellectual property rights system is not only a very new concept but it is also very western...[W]ith [western style] intellectual property property rights, alien laws will be devised to exploit the Indigenous knowledge and [cultural] resources of the Indigenous peoples.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The [western] intellectual property rights system and the (mis)appropriation of Indigenous knowledge without the prior knowledge and consent of Indigenous peoples evoke feelings of anger, or being cheated''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Indigenous peoples are not benefiting from the intellectual property rights system.  Indigenous knowledge and [cultural] resources are being eroded, exploited and/or appropriated by outsiders in the likes of transnational corporations, institutions, researchers, and scientists who are after profits and benefits gained..''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"For indigenous peoples, life is a common property which cannot be owned, commercialized, and monopolised...Based on this world view, Indigenous peoples find it difficult to relate [western] intellectual property rights...to their daily lives...''&lt;ref name="FOUR003"&gt;FOURMILE 1996: Pages 268–269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Suva Statement on Indigenous Peoples Knowledge and Intellectual Property Rights, April 1995===

Participants from the independent countries and "nonautonomous colonised territories" of the Pacific region met in [[Suva]], [[Fiji]] to discuss internationally dominant intellectual property rights regimes, and at that meeting they resolved to support the Kari Oca, Mataatua, Julayinbul, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Tambunan initiatives&lt;ref name="FOUR004"/&gt;(above).  In particular participants:&lt;ref name="FOUR004"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Reaffirme[d] that imperialism is perpetuated through [western] intellectual property rights systems...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Declar[ed] Indigenous peoples are willing to share our knowledge with humanity provided we determine when, where and how it is used: at present the international system does not recognise or respect our past, present and potential contribution...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Seek[s] repatriation of Indigenous peoples [cultural] resources already held in external collections, and seek[s] compensation and royalties from commercial developments resulting from these resources''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...encourage[s]...governments...to protest against any [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] provisions which facilitate the expropriation of Indigenous peoples'  knowledge and resources...[to instead] incorporate the concerns of Indigenous peoples...into legislation...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''[Seek to] Strengthen the capacities of Indigenous peoples to maintain their oral traditions, and encourage initiatives by Indigenous peoples to record their knowledge .. according to their customary access procedures.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Urge universities, churches, government, non-government organizations, and other institutions to reconsider their roles in the expropriation of Indigenous people's knowledge and resources and to assist in their return to their rightful owners."''&lt;ref name="FOUR004"&gt;FOURMILE 1996: Pages 270–272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kimberley Declaration, August, 2002===

([[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]] August 2002)

Indigenous people from around the world attended an international indigenous peoples' summit on sustainable development in Khoi-San Territory, [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]], where they reaffirmed previous declarations and statements (above), and, amongst other matters, declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Our traditional knowledge systems must be respected, promoted and protected; our collective intellectual property rights must be guaranteed and ensured. Our traditional knowledge is not in the public domain; it is collective, cultural and intellectual property protected under our customary law. Unauthorized use and misappropriation of traditional knowledge is theft.''&lt;ref name="WIPO001"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, September, 2007 ===
{{main article|Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples}}
[[File:UN General Assembly.jpg|thumb|230px|right|United Nations General Assembly 2003]]
At the United Nation's General Assembly's 61st session, on 13 September 2007, an overwhelming majority of members resolved to adopt the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS | first =  | year = 2007 | url = http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/indigenous/declaration.htm | title = Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples | format = WEB PAGE | work =  | publisher = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 11''': ''Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, protect and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, technologies and visual and performing arts and literature.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''States shall provide redress through effective mechanisms, which may include restitution, developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples, with respect to their cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without their free, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs.''&lt;ref&gt;UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 24''': ''Indigenous peoples have the right to their traditional medicines and to maintain their health practices, including the conservation of their vital medicinal plants, animals and minerals...''&lt;ref name="UNGA001"&gt;UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY Page 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 31''': ''Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''In conjunction with indigenous peoples, States shall take effective measures to recognize and protect the exercise of these rights."''&lt;ref name="UNGA001"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism and Problems ==
Theory for intellectual property/privilege law is give creators temporary government monopoly for help creators earn their investments (patents and copyrights) but with idea after monopoly terminates everything becomes public domain for help create new innovation. Because of this theory, use intellectual property/privilege for control culture create many problems:

• Most culture items are too old for patent or copyright.  Additionally, often the author or creator unknown.

• Registration is not filed and fees are not paid

• Natural languages lie within the public domain

• Art styles lie within the public domain

• Properties of fauna and flora are scientific fact and their discovery and description can't have intellectual privilege for facts or information. Fauna and flora evolved, not created by humans.

• Can't own culture, it belongs to every person that uses it. This causes problems with human rights like expression freedom and choice.

• Cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions lie in the public domain.

• Powerful indigenous cultures in Europa (English, Italianos, Russians, etc) and Asia (Hindustanis, Han Chinese, etc.) can reverse this and forbid indigenous people from their culture (modern medicine, science, mathematics, printing, combustion engines, computer, etc) and languages (like English, Chinese, Arabic, etc.) and religions (Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, etc.)

• Indigenous people consume more outside culture than they can give

• Intellectual property owners must pay maintenance fee (patents).

• Proponents have not offered a solid concept of collective intellectual property rights, need a specific owner that can follow laws and must accept liability in courts.

• Names of all groups are generic, can't protect name Maori, Apache more than English, or Thai, Chinese.

• Intellectual property is an idea that belongs to European culture, therefore it fails to meet the needs of indigenous culture since it is too stuck up to see indigenous communities eye to eye and come to an understanding

• People innovate around restrictions

• May encourage use of stereotypes instead because outside people created them

• Restricting culture helps it become lost 

• Use of intellectual property/privilege this encourages the move against cultural prostitution.

== Traditional cultural expressions ==

The phrase "traditional cultural expressions" is used by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] to refer to "any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied. They are transmitted from one generation to the next, and include handmade textiles, paintings, stories, legends, ceremonies, music, songs, rhythms and dance."&lt;ref name=Engaging&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=7|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional cultural expressions can include designs and styles, which means that applying traditional Western-style international copyright laws{{snd}}which apply to a specific work, rather than a style{{snd}}can be problematic. Indigenous customary law often treats such concepts differently, and may apply restrictions upon the use of underlying styles and concepts.&lt;ref name=Engaging/&gt;

==Examples of Indigenous peoples claiming violation of their intellectual property==

===Intertribal Coalitions in North America===

Since the 1970s, Intertribal groups in North American have organized demonstrations against non-native use of Native American cultural elements; such as the sale of products and services allegedly derived from Indigenous knowledge:&lt;ref name=hagan&gt;Hagan, Helene E. [http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/features/spirg-hagan.html "The Plastic Medicine People Circle."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305155048/http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/features/spirg-hagan.html |date=5 March 2013 }} ''Sonoma Free County Press.'' Accessed 31 Jan 2013: "Shequish...came to the attention of Native American people two years ago as an impostor who pretended to have Shumash ancestry. I received a personal telephone call and a letter from the Chairman of a Shumash group south of Monterey. This phone call and a letter followed a Council meeting in which Shumash people took the decision to put a stop to Shequish Ohoho's activities in the Bay area as an 'Indian woman.' A group of real Indian women of San Francisco led a protest against Shequish and effectively terminated her money making seminars and ceremonies in this area. Her real name and background are known to California Indians who have denied her any tribal affiliation."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sieg1"&gt;Sieg, Katrin, ''Ethnic Drag: Performing Race, Nation, Sexuality in West Germany'';  University of Michigan Press (20 August 2002) p.232&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is a very alarming trend. So alarming that it came to the attention of an international and intertribal group of medicine people and spiritual leaders called the Circle of Elders. They were highly concerned with these activities and during one of their gatherings addressed the issue by publishing a list of Plastic Shamans in ''Akwesasne Notes'', along with a plea for them to stop their exploitative activities. One of the best known Plastic Shamans, Lynn Andrews, has been picketed by the Native communities in New York, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Seattle and other cities.&lt;ref name="Sieg1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota Peoples===

The 1993 Lakota Declaration of War (see above), urges people to identify instances where sacred traditions are being abused and to work toward stopping the abuse through demonstrations, boycotts, press coverage and direct intervention.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taliman1"/&gt;

==== ''Ka Mate'' haka ====
[[File:Te Raparaha, chief of the Kawias, watercolour by R. Hall, c. 1840s.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Te Rauparaha]], alleged composer of ''Ka Mate''.]]
{{Main article|Ka Mate}}
Since the 19th century, Maori-style [[Haka]]s have been popularly-used by New Zealanders as [[Haka (sports)|a cheer at sporting events]]; especially for New Zealand national teams.  Between 1998 and 2006, the [[Ngati Toa]] [[iwi]] attempted to trademark the [[Ka Mate]] [[haka]] and to forbid its use by commercial organisations without their permission.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/793975.stm

|title= Iwi threatens to place trademark on All Black haka|work=The New Zealand Herald |date=2005-05-22 |accessdate=2008-05-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand]] turned their claim down in 2006, since ''Ka Mate'' had achieved wide recognition in New Zealand and abroad as representing New Zealand as a whole and not a particular trader.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10389347 |title=Iwi claim to All Black haka turned down|work=The New Zealand Herald |date=2007-07-02 |accessdate=2008-05-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, as a part of a wider settlement of grievances, the [[New Zealand government]] agreed to:
:"...record the authorship and significance of the haka Ka Mate to Ngāti Toa and ... work with Ngāti Toa to address their concerns with the haka... [but] does not expect that redress will result in royalties for the use of Ka Mate or provide Ngāti Toa with a veto on the performance of Ka Mate...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/livearticle.asp?ArtID=1234231829 Ngāti Toa Rangatira Letter of Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521222630/http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/LiveArticle.asp?ArtID=1234231829 |date=21 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7882775.stm|title=New Zealand Maori win haka fight |date=11 February 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a survey of nineteenth-century New Zealand newspapers found Ka Mate was used by tribes from other parts of New Zealand, and was generally described by them as being an ancient peacekeeping song, from eras long before its appropriation by the Ngati Toa chief Te Rauparaha. When Ngati Toa authorities were asked for evidence that Ka Mate was of Ngati Toa authorship, they were unable to provide any.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folksong.org.nz/ka_mate/ka_mate.pdf|title=Archer J.H.

==== Lego's Bionicle ====

In 2001 a dispute concerning the popular [[LEGO]] toy-line "[[Bionicle]]" arose between [[Denmark|Danish]] toymaker [[Lego Group]] and several Māori tribal groups (fronted by lawyer Maui Solomon) and members of the on-line discussion forum ([[Aotearoa Cafe]]). The Bionicle product line allegedly used many words [[Cultural appropriation|appropriated]] from Māori language, imagery and folklore. The dispute ended in an amicable settlement. Initially Lego refused to withdraw the product, saying it had drawn the names from many cultures, but later agreed that it had taken the names from Māori and agreed to change certain names or spellings to help set the toy-line apart from the Māori legends. This did not prevent the many Bionicle users from continuing to use the disputed words, resulting in the popular Bionicle website BZPower coming under a [[denial-of-service attack]] for four days from an attacker using the name Kotiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/11/56451|title=Lego Site Irks Maori Sympathizer|last=Griggs|first=Kim|date=21 November 2002 |work=Wired|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a New Zealander in [[Jerusalem]] discovered that the [[Philip Morris International|Phillip Morris]] cigarette company had started producing a brand of cigarette in Israel called the "L &amp; M Maori mix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411319/638858 |title=Disgust over 'Maori' brand cigarettes |date=12 December 2005 |work=TVNZ |accessdate=29 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613105447/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411319/638858 |archivedate=13 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the head of Phillip Morris, [[Louis C.

===Hopi and Apache Opt-Out From American Museums===

In 1994 certain Native American tribal organisations demanded that a number of museums remove certain materials from exhibition and access to the public. They cited the [[NAGPRA]] as the legal basis for their complaints.  Their position was that they would only permit such uses, selectively. after permission was requested directly to them.
Vernon Masayesva, CEO of the Hopi Tribe, and a consortium of Apache tribes demanded a number of American museums end public exhibition of and access to materials from their tribal cultures; including images, text, ceremonies, music, songs, stories, symbols, beliefs, customs, ideas, concepts and ethnographic field-notes, feature films, historical works, and any other medium in which their culture may appear literally, imagined, expressed, parodied or embellished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brown | first = Michael F. | authorlink =  | title = Can Culture Be Copyrighted? | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–222 | date = April 1998 | url = | jstor = 10.1086/204721 | doi=10.1086/204721}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 12 Dec 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Santiago Render''' (born April 20, 1975), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Killer Mike''', is an American rapper, actor, and activist. He is the founder of Grind Time Official Records, which he launched through the [[SMC Recordings|SMC]] and [[Fontana Distribution]]. Mike made his debut on "Snappin' and Trappin{{'"}} from [[OutKast]]'s 2000 LP ''[[Stankonia]]'', and later appeared on the [[Grammy]]-winning song "[[The Whole World]]", a single from Outkast's greatest hits album ''[[Big Boi and Dre Present...Outkast]]''. He has since released five full-length albums as a solo artist.

In December 2008, Mike confirmed he signed to fellow Atlanta-based rapper [[T.I.]]'s [[Grand Hustle Records]]. In 2012, he released ''[[R.A.P. Music]]'', produced entirely by American rapper/producer [[El-P]]. Killer Mike and El-P subsequently formed a duo in 2013, branding themselves [[Run the Jewels]]; the duo was signed to [[Fool's Gold Records]] and released their [[Run the Jewels (album)|self-titled debut]] in June of that year.

Killer Mike is also known as a social and political activist, focusing on subjects including [[social inequality]], [[police brutality]], and [[systemic racism]]. In addition to addressing themes of racism and police brutality in his music, he has also delivered several lectures at colleges and universities, written about social justice topics for publications such as ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', and been the subject of televised and published interviews regarding police misconduct and race relations. He was a visible and vocal supporter of [[Bernie Sanders]] during his [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential campaign]], and refused to support [[Hillary Clinton]] after Sanders left the race.

Killer Mike has been featured in the films ''20 Funerals'', ''[[Idlewild (film)|Idlewild]]'', ''[[Baby Driver | Baby Driver]]'' and ''[[ATL (film)|ATL]]''.

(Killer Mike song)|A.D.I.D.A.S.]]", featuring [[Big Boi]] and [[Sleepy Brown]], which peaked at #60 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

{{main|I Pledge Allegiance to the Grind|I Pledge Allegiance to the Grind II|Pledge (album)|R.A.P. Music}}
What was to be his second album, ''Ghetto Extraordinary'', had its release date pushed back several times due to disputes between [[Big Boi]] and [[Sony Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2006/03/beautiful-struggle/ |title=Killer Mike: Beautiful Struggle |website=XXLmag.com |date=March 3, 2006 |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally recorded in 2005, the album was eventually self-released as a [[mixtape]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=GE_release_Complex&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/11/listeners-guide-killer-mike-el-p/killer-mike-ghetto-extraordinary |title=Killer Mike "Ghetto Extraordinary" (2005) - A Listener's Guide to Killer Mike and El-P |website=Complex |date=November 2, 2014 |author=Steiner, B.J. |accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GE_release_Pitchfork&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11087-ghetto-extraordinary/ |title=Killer Mike: Ghetto Extraordinary |website=Pitchfork |date=February 12, 2008 |author=Cohen, Ian |accessdate=May 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Killer Mike's second official album, ''[[I Pledge Allegiance to the Grind]]'', was released on his own Grind Time Official label in 2006, followed by ''[[I Pledge Allegiance to the Grind II]]'' in 2008.

According to an article published in the June 2007 issue of [[XXL (magazine)|XXL]], Killer Mike addressed why he left the Purple Ribbon roster. He stated that he felt as if Purple Ribbon was the equivalent to the "Clippers," while he wanted to join the "Lakers."{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} T.I. later announced that he and Killer Mike had been in talks about bringing Mike to his [[Grand Hustle Records|Grand Hustle]] imprint on Atlantic, and Killer Mike confirmed that he had signed in December 2008.&lt;ref name=KM_TI_signing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.8224/title.exclusive-killer-mike-confirms-signing-with-t-i |title=Exclusive: Killer Mike Confirms Signing With T.I. |website=HipHopDX.com |date=December 8, 2008 |author=Arnold, Paul |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theboombox.com/killer-mike-signs-with-t-i-s-grand-hustle-entertainment/ |title=Killer Mike Signs With T.I.'s Grand Hustle Entertainment |website=The Boombox |date=December 16, 2008 |author=Bark, Theo |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He released his fourth official album, ''[[PL3DGE]]'', on Grand Hustle in 2011.

In 2013, Killer Mike announced that he was working to release two albums in 2014, ''I Pledge Allegiance to the Grind IV'' and ''R.A.P. Music II'', both of which were to feature production by [[EL-P]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/03/killer-mike-reveals-i-pledge-allegiance-to-the-grind-iv/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: Killer Mike Reveals "I Pledge Allegiance To The Grind IV" |website=XXLmag.com |date=March 21, 2013 |author=Ryon, Sean |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2013_albums&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.23285/title.killer-mike-preps-pledge-iv-r-a-p-music-ii- |title=Killer Mike Preps "Pledge IV" &amp; "R.A.P.

[[File:Run The Jewels at Treefort Music Festival.jpg|thumb|200px|Killer Mike (left) and El-P (right) as Run the Jewels at [[Treefort Music Fest]] in 2014.]]
{{main|Run the Jewels}}
Killer Mike was introduced to rapper/producer [[El-P]] by [[Cartoon Network]] executive Jason DeMarco in 2011.&lt;ref name=RollingStone_RTJ&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/run-the-jewels-how-2014s-hardest-rap-duo-came-back-from-oblivion-20141024 |title=Run the Jewels: 2014's Brashest Rap Duo Comes Back From Oblivion |newspaper=Rolling Stone |date=October 24, 2014 |author=Weingarten, Christopher R. |accessdate=May 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[El-P]] produced Mike's album ''[[R.A.P. Music]]'' and guested on the song "Butane (Champion's Anthem)". That same year, Killer Mike guested on El-P's album ''[[Cancer 4 Cure]]''. When ''R.A.P. Music'' and ''Cancer 4 Cure'' were released within weeks of each other, the two rappers decided to tour together. The success of the tour eventually led to the decision to record as a duo, which they named [[Run the Jewels]].&lt;ref name=RTJ_NPR&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/microphonecheck/2014/11/11/363125142/run-the-jewels-im-taking-this-life |title=Run The Jewels: 'I'm Taking This Life' |website=NPR - Microphone Check |date= November 11, 2014 |author=Kelley, Frannie |accessdate=May 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Run the Jewels released a free [[Run the Jewels (album)|eponymous album]] on June 26, 2013.&lt;ref name=RTJ_releasedate/&gt; The next year, on October 28, 2014, Run the Jewels released their second free album, ''[[Run the Jewels 2]]''.&lt;ref name=RTJ2_release/&gt; On September 25, 2015, the duo released a re-recorded version of ''Run the Jewels 2'' made entirely with [[cat communication|cat sounds]], titled ''[[Meow the Jewels]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spin.com/2015/09/meow-the-jewels-run-the-jewels-killer-mike-el-p-review-cat-sound-remix/ |title=Five Thoughts About 'Meow the Jewels,' Because How the Hell Would You Actually Review This? |website=Spin.com |author=Grebey, James |date=September 29, 2015 |accessdate=October 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third album, ''[[Run the Jewels 3]]'', was released on December 24, 2016.&lt;ref name=BB_RTJ3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7633335/run-the-jewels-new-album-rtj3-early-release-listen |title=Run the Jewels' New Album, 'RTJ3,' Released Early: Listen |website=Billboard.com |date=December 26, 2016 |author=DiMeglio, Mary J. |accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other ventures==
===Acting===
Mike has been featured in the films ''20 Funerals'', ''[[Idlewild (film)|Idlewild]]'' (2006), and ''[[ATL (film)|ATL]]'' (2006). He has also performed as a [[voice actor]], playing a rapper/actor-turned-U.S. President named [[List of characters in Frisky Dingo#Taqu'il|Taqu'il]] in the [[Adult Swim]] cartoon ''[[Frisky Dingo]]'' from 2006 to 2008. Mike guest-voiced a [[Boost Mobile]] phone in an episode of the same name of Adult Swim's ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]''. He appeared twice on the Adult Swim [[surreal comedy]] series ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]'', once in 2012, where he acted as a [[hype man]] for a female opera singer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9OaL07Yy8|title=Killer Mike: Eric Andre Show: Killer Mike and Opera|first=|last=Adult Swim|date=11 June 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2014, where he performed a rap battle with [[Action Bronson]] while the two were forced to walk on treadmills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5h0oNZUB54|title=Treadmill Rap Battle Action Bronson Killer Mike - The Eric Andre Show - Adult Swim|first=|last=Adult Swim|date=21 November 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/57543-killer-mike-and-action-bronson-battle-rap-on-treadmills-on-the-eric-andre-show/|title=Killer Mike and Action Bronson Battle Rap on Treadmills on "The Eric André Show" - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graffitis SWAG Barbershop===
Mike and his wife, Shana, opened a barbershop in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] on November 1, 2011. The two acquired and reworked a barbershop and named it "Graffitis SWAG" (Shave, Wash, And Groom). He had waited nine years before choosing to open the barbershop, after having an early business manager advise him against the plan. It took his wife advising him to do it now while he had the time and money to pursue his lifelong dream. He eventually plans to open 150 shops across the United States over time, predominantly in cities with large black communities.&lt;ref name=BarberSchools&gt;{{cite web|last=Physioc |first=Heather E. |url=http://www.barber-schools.org/blog/killer-mikes-barber-shop-in-atlanta-ga-graffiti-swag |title=Killer Mike's Barbershop in Atlanta, GA - Graffiti's SWAG |website=Barber-Schools.org |date=July 2, 2012 |accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The barbershop is decorated with artwork on the walls honoring historic black leaders like [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Mike said that he hopes to "lift up men in the community who are out of work and help move them toward sustainable, lifelong careers" and give his employees "opportunity for real economic elevation". As of 2012, the shop employed six barbers, with plans to add four to six more licensed barbers to the team. Mike also said that he hoped to pursue his own barber license in the winter of 2012.&lt;ref name=BarberSchools/&gt;

The enterprise has been successful and the shop has become a gathering place for the community, in addition to hosting events such as a season premiere for ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' and serving as the setting for several music videos. A second location in [[Tampa, Florida]] was planned for 2014.&lt;ref name=SWAG_Bevel&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bevelcode.com/inside-the-shop/graffitis-swag |title=Killer Mike's Graffiti's SWAG Barbershop |website=Bevel Code |date=November 17, 2014 |author=Howard, Marcia |accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SWAG_BE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackenterprise.com/small-business/kille-mike-interview-swag-barbershop-airport-atlanta/ |title=Rapper Killer Mike Redefines 'SWAG' with Barbershop |website=Black Enterprise |date=June 30, 2013 |author=Garland, Maurice |accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Mike is an outspoken social activist focusing on subjects including [[social equality]], [[police brutality]], and [[systemic racism]].&lt;ref name=activism&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theurbandaily.com/2015/04/20/killer-mike-mit-mike-brown/ |title=How Killer Mike Became Rap's Most Influential Political Leader |website=The Urban Daily |date=April 20, 2015 |author=Balfour, Jay |accessdate=May 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His views are reflected in his music, as well as in interviews with the media. As a publicly viewed figure, Mike feels it is his responsibility to represent African-Americans: "I feel I have to be politically active and I have to be a credit to my race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Killer Mike, Venerable Rapper/Activist, Talks New Album, Drug War, and Maybe Running for Office |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/155338/killer_mike%2C_venerable_rapper_activist%2C_talks_new_album%2C_drug_war%2C_and_maybe_running_for_office?page=0%2C2 |website=Alternet |author=Shepherd, Julianne Escobedo |date=May 8, 2012 |accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been vocal on the subject of police misconduct, his father being a former police officer. His anti-brutality sentiment can be found on the song "Reagan" from his album ''[[R.A.P. Music]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reagan - R.A.P Music |author=Killer Mike |date=May 15, 2012 |publisher=Williams Street Records}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the song "Early" on ''[[Run the Jewels 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Run The Jewels |title=Early - RTJ2 |date=October 28, 2014 |publisher=Mass Appeal Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/run-jewels-release-dark-stark-new-video-early-219504 |title=Run The Jewels release dark, stark new video for "Early" |website=The A.V.

In response to the 2014 [[shooting of Michael Brown]] controversy in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], Mike said:

{{quote|I'm appalled that regular Americans are apathetic. I'm appalled that people choose to use the word "thug" as a code word for "nigger". I'm appalled at everyday citizens... when will we, as an American constituency, tell our politicians enough's enough? Enough mayors supporting murderous police departments. Enough police chiefs having to give excuses for murderous police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Killer Mike, J.

In an [[op-ed]] published in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, Killer Mike stated that "there is no reason that Mike Brown and also [[Death of Eric Garner|Eric Garner]] are dead today—except bad policing, excessive force, and the hunt-and-capture-prey mentality many thrill-seeking cops have adapted".&lt;ref name=Billboard_op-ed&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/6221888/op-ed-killer-mike-on-the-problems-underlying-the-chaos-in-ferguson |title=Op-Ed: Killer Mike on the Problems Underlying the Chaos in Ferguson |newspaper=Billboard |date=August 19, 2014 |author=Killer Mike |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike and El-P performed at The Ready Room in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on November 24, 2014, the same night that the Grand Jury verdict was announced stating that Darren Wilson would not be charged with a crime in the shooting of Michael Brown. Mike opened the set, which began about two hours after the announcement was made, with a heartfelt speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQs7CWKHM9w |title=Killer Mike's pre-show Ferguson Grand Jury speech |publisher=YouTube |date=November 24, 2014 |accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fan-shot footage of the speech later went viral.&lt;ref name=RTJ_Ferguson&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/26/run-the-jewels-on-hip-hops-golden-age-playing-ferguson-and-americas-civil-rights-problem |title=Run the Jewels on hip-hop's golden age, playing Ferguson and America's civil rights problem |newspaper=The Guardian |date=February 26, 2015 |author=Petridis, Alexis |accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike, in an op-ed, defended rap lyrics and says that they should be defended as freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/11/28/poetic-injustice-rap-supreme-court-lyrics-violence-trial-column/19537391/|title=Rap's poetic (In)justice: Flashback|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on the [[2015 Baltimore uprising]] related to the [[death of Freddie Gray]], Killer Mike noted that he understood the frustrations leading to violent demonstrations, but encouraged protesters to use their energy to organize for lasting change. In a ''Billboard'' op-ed, Mike stated:

{{quote|For the people of Baltimore—I don't criticize rioting because I understand it. But after the fires die down: organize, strategize, and mobilize. Like Ferguson, you have an opportunity to start anew. I don't have a solution because whoever's there will have to come up with it. But we need community relations: riots are the language of the unheard.&lt;ref name=KM_BaltimoreOpEd&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6553719/killer-mike-baltimore-op-ed-correspondents-dinner-freddie-gray |title=Killer Mike Baltimore Op-Ed: 'I've Watched Geraldo Rivera and Wolf Blitzer Pander to the Audiences of Oppression' |newspaper=Billboard |date=May 1, 2015 |author=Killer Mike |accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He made similar points in an interview with the ''[[Harvard Political Review]]'': "Baltimore is an opportunity for us to do something different. As society, there's a real opportunity to organize there, and if we do not take full advantage of the opportunity to organize, then the riots truly meant nothing."&lt;ref name=KM_HPR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harvardpolitics.com/interviews/killer-mike-baltimore-riots-police/ |title=Killer Mike on the Baltimore Riots |newspaper=Harvard Political Review |date=April 29, 2015 |author=Mulholland, Quinn |accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political involvement===
[[File:Killer Mike Introduces Bernie Sanders in Atlanta.webm|thumb|Killer Mike introduces [[Bernie Sanders]] at a November 2015 [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|campaign rally]] in Atlanta]]
In June 2015, Mike briefly ran as a [[write-in candidate]] to become the representative for Georgia's 55th district in the [[Georgia House of Representatives]]. Despite encouraging voters to write in his real name, Michael Render, any votes he received would not have been considered valid due to his failure to previously register as an official candidate in the election.&lt;ref name=KM_writein_AJC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/rapper-killer-mike-runs-for-georgia-state-represen/nmdSW/ |title=Rapper Killer Mike wanted to run for Georgia state representative |newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=June 15, 2015 |author=Funke, Daniel |accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KM_writein_CNN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/16/us/killer-mike-write-in-candidate/ |title=Killer Mike to Georgia voters: Pick me! ...

Mike announced his support of Democratic U.S. presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] in June 2015 after Sanders announced his intention to restore the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].&lt;ref name=KM_Sanders&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/29/killer-mike-bernie-sanders-president-run-the-jewels |title=Killer Mike Endorses Bernie Sanders for President |newspaper=The Guardian |date=June 29, 2015 |author=Holpuch, Amanda |accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After introducing Sanders at a rally held in Atlanta November 23, 2015,&lt;ref name=RS_Bernie_Rally&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-killer-mike-introduce-bernie-sanders-with-moving-speech-at-atlanta-rally-20151123|title=Watch Killer Mike Introduce Bernie Sanders With Moving Speech at Atlanta Rally|website=Rolling Stone|date=November 23, 2015|author=Kreps, Daniel|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike spent time recording an interview with the presidential candidate at Mike's barbershop.

In the following months, he remained an active and vocal supporter of Sanders, delivering speeches at rallies, voicing support in televised interviews and on social media, and traveling with the campaign.&lt;ref name=NYT_KM_Sanders&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/09/us/politics/bernie-sanders-has-killer-mike-in-his-corner.html?_r=0|title=Bernie Sanders Has Killer Mike in His Corner|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 8, 2016|first=Jonah|last=Bromwich|accessdate=February 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MT_KM_Sanders&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcgilltribune.com/a-e/when-rappers-feel-the-bern-impact-killer-mike-lil-b-bernie-sanders-campaign-42892|title=When rappers feel the Bern: The impact Killer Mike and Lil B can have on Bernie Sanders' campaign|newspaper=McGill Tribune|date=February 1, 2016|author=Rodgers, Ian|accessdate=February 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Mike received criticism during his activism for Sanders for quoting American anti-racism and LGBT advocate [[Jane Elliott]] regarding [[Hillary Clinton]], which was criticized as misogynistic and mistakenly attributed as being his original phrasing online and in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Tom|title=Sanders campaign defends Killer Mike using 'uterus' quote about Clinton|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/killer-mike-uterus-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-jane-elliott|date=February 17, 2016|website=The Guardian |accessdate=February 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Sanders' exit from the race, Mike refused to support Clinton, whom he perceived as pro-war.&lt;ref name=HillaryNope&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/killer-mike-says-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton-are-exactly-the-same|title=Killer Mike says Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are exactly the same|publisher=CBS News|date=August 12, 2016|author=Ehrbar, Ned|accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been an advocate for investment in [[African-American businesses|black-owned banks]]; in July 2016 he called for people to transfer their money to black-owned [[Atlanta]] bank Citizens Trust, stating, "We don't have to burn our city down. But what we can do is go to your banks tomorrow. You can go to your bank tomorrow. And you can say, 'Until you as a corporation start to speak on our behalf, I want all my money. And I'm taking all my money to Citizens Trust".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/66804-killer-mike-prompts-huge-influx-into-black-owned-bank|title=Killer Mike Prompts "Huge Influx" Into Black-Owned Bank|author=Hogan, Mark|publisher=''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''|date=July 14, 2016|accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/07/15/black-owned-banks-credit-unions/87118624/|title=Black-owned banks get rush of new depositors|author=Bomey, Nathan|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=July 15, 2016|accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, at London's [[Field Day (festival)|Field Day]] festival, Mike endorsed [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 UK general election]].&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Beaumont-Thomas|first=Ben|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/16/jeremy-corbyn-pyramid-stage-glastonbury-festival-2017|title=Jeremy Corbyn to appear on Pyramid stage at Glastonbury festival 2017|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=June 16, 2017|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2018, Mike appeared on [[National Rifle Association|NRATV]] with host [[Colion Noir]] defending black gun ownership. He says it had been filmed a week prior to the March for Our Lives yet released the weekend of the protest. He also stated that he told his children that if they participated in the [[2018 United States gun violence protests|National School Walkout]] that he would expect them to leave the family home. On March 26, 2018, he posted a video stating that the NRA used his interview out of context, saying he actually supports [[March for Our Lives]] while simultaneously advocating for black gun ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/killer-mike-defends-gun-ownership-in-nratv-interview-w518353#|title=Run the Jewels' Killer Mike Defends Gun Ownership in NRATV Interview|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2018/03/26/596988606/killer-mike-apologizes-for-interview-with-nra-claims-it-was-misused|title=Killer Mike Apologizes For Interview With NRA, Claims It Was Misused|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- {{Expand Dutch|topic=culture|date=January 2015|Portret van Annie Hall in Lissadell, Kenley, Surrey }} --&gt;
'''''Lady in white ''''' is an [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting of a [[woman]] wearing a white robe, from 1886, by [[Dutch painter]] [[Jan Toorop]].

==Painting==
The [[painting]] shows an intense, almost plain [[white]] colour on the woman's robe, contrasted with dark tones in the background, in an almost [[monochrome]] [[color scheme|color palette]]. Beside the woman there is a radiant circle of a [[wine glass]] filled with red wine. Toorop portrays his future wife in a manner influenced by [[James Ensor]] and [[James McNeill Whistler]]'s Impressionist style.&lt;!-- hope it is wine --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jan-toorop.com/artwork/20|title=Dame en blanche (Annie Hall)|publisher=jan-toorop.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annie Hall==
The model is Annie Hall (1860-1929), an [[English people|English]] woman who was studying in [[Brussels]] when Toorop met her in 1885. They got married in 1886.
Toorop painted several paintings of Annie, in which she is depicted in similar white [[robe]]s.  
&lt;!-- as his model. These paintings resemble in style, the [[palette knife]] technique and in atmosphere the early works by James Ensor, whom Toorop knew from his time in [[Belgium]] (1883-1885). Besides the present painting two other versions of Dame en blanche exist; a subject which intrigued the artist throughout the years 1885-1886 (Annie Hall at Lissadell, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam from 1885 and Woman in white, Museum voor schone kunsten, Gent) Toorop represented Annie preferably in white, paying no special attention to the face of the woman. She always seems lost in thoughts. --&gt;

In 1883 while in [[Brussels]] Toorop allied himself with a group of avant-garde young artists called [[Les Vingt]] ("the twenty"), a group he eventually joined in 1885. The artists of "Les Vingt" and especially [[James Ensor]] strongly influenced him during this period.

In 1884 Toorop made a trip to [[London]] with his friend [[Emile Verhaeren]] and the art critic [[Georges Destrée]]. At the end of 1885 he returned to England for several months, where he lived on the estate of Annie Hall's parents. During his stay in England Toorop became very impressed by the work of [[James McNeill Whistler]], whose paintings he had encountered during an exhibition by Les Vingt in 1884. On the introduction of [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] he visited Whistler's studio in London; between 1885 and 1887 Whistler's work was a great inspiration for Toorop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/socialezekerheid/BWN/BWN/lemmata/bwn1/toorop|title=Toorop|publisher=resources.huygens.knaw.nl|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of James McNeill Whistler on this portrait of Annie Hall is unmistakably reflected in the dominant use of a brightly illuminated white in Annie's dress and embroidery. The presence of the aestheticist beauty ideal is clearly recognizable. Toorop made several portraits of Annie Hall during the period 1885-1887 in the same style, evoking memories of the "symphonies" ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl]]''; ''[[Symphony in White, No. 2: The Little White Girl]]'', and ''[[Symphony in White, No. 3]]'' that Whistler made at that time.

In Toorop's ''Lady in white'' from the end of 1886, he still seems to be inspired by Whistler more emphatically than in the other portrait he made of Annie called ''Portrait of Annie Hall in Lissadell''. The atmosphere is generally dreamy and melancholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/187501775x00225?crawler=true|title=Toorop|publisher=booksandjournals.brillonline.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15874">The following is a non-exhaustive list of [[K-pop]] videos that have been banned by South Korean television networks, for reasons such as suggestive or offensive lyrics and imagery.

K-pop is a genre of modern [[pop music]] that originates from [[South Korea]]. It is characterized by a wide variety of audiovisual elements, and K-pop singles will typically include a music video and a dance routine. There is a history of media [[censorship in South Korea|censorship]] and [[conservatism in South Korea]], and as a result, many risque or explicit K-pop songs or videos have been banned by South Korean broadcasting stations. Other reasons for banning include having Japanese lyrics, negatively influencing youth, or use of brand names.

[[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], and [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]] are the three largest broadcasting and television networks, and they account for the vast majority of banned K-pop videos. In September 2012, it was revealed that these networks had banned over 1,300 K-pop songs in the past three years alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/89575/20140430/what-it-takes-to-get-a-song-banned-from-broadcast-stations-in-korea.htm|title=What It Takes To Get A Song Banned From Broadcast Stations In Korea|last=KpopStarz|date=2014-04-30|work=KpopStarz|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This list only includes titular k-pop songs that have an accompanying music video, but many K-pop songs that were not title tracks have been banned as well.

== Aftermath of bans ==

=== Revising ===
Often, the entertainment company that owns the banned song will try to revise the song and have its reevaluated by the broadcasting company. They may edit the music video and delete the controversial scenes and re-release the new video. Other times, they may alter the explicit dance moves or change a song's lyrics so that the song may still be performed on music shows, such as [[Music Bank (TV series)|Music Bank.]] In the case of EXO's "Lotto," which as banned due to the title being a brand name, the group sang the word "louder" instead of "lotto" while performing the song live. This revision allowed the song to be performed on KBS and MBC music shows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although K-pop songs and videos are often banned by KBS, is it less often for MBC or SBS to place a ban. Some groups are content to promote themselves on networks other than KBS and do not make any changes to their original material. In regards to PSY's "Gentlemen," a spokesperson for YG Entertainment said they had no plans to submit a difference version of their video, and they followed the decision made by KBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/04/18/south-korean-tv-network-bans-psys-video/|title=South Korean TV Network Bans Psy’s Video|last=Kwaak|first=Jeyup S.|date=2013-04-18|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When 12 out of 18 songs of [[Cheetah (rapper)|Cheetah]]'s album were deemed unfit for broadcast by KBS and five by SBS, the agency stated that they did not plan on making any changes to the lyrics in order to "keep the original intentions and meanings of the song."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allkpop.com/article/2018/02/12-songs-in-cheetahs-new-album-deemed-unfit-for-kbs-agency-says-no-changes-will-be-made-in-lyrics|title=12 songs in Cheetah's new album deemed unfit for KBS + agency says no changes will be made in lyrics|work=allkpop|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fan reactions ===
Of all the broadcasting networks, KBS has banned the most songs and videos, earning it the nickname "Korean Banning System." When a more explicit video is released, fans have come to expect the video to be deemed inappropriate for broadcast by KBS.

There have been cases of fans arguing against a banning decision. When KBS deemed several of Block B's new songs as being unfit for broadcast, an online petition appeared, requesting that KBS reconsider their decision. It gained 2,400 signatures within a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allkpop.com/article/2012/01/kbs-deems-block-bs-new-songs-unfit-for-broadcast|title=KBS deems Block B's new songs unfit for broadcast|work=allkpop|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milein Cosman was born in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], Germany, in 1921 but spent most of her childhood in [[Düsseldorf]]. Because of her Jewish background and the rise of [[Nazism|National Socialism]], she went to school in Switzerland, at the [[Ecole d'Humanité]] and the [[International School of Geneva]] between 1937 and 1939. She came to England in 1939.&lt;ref name="Spalding"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Frances Spalding]]|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1990|title=20th Century Painters and Sculptors |ISBN=1 85149 106 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1939 and 1942, Cosman studied at the [[Slade School of Art]].&lt;ref name="Spalding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; The Slade was located in [[Oxford]] during the war years and there Cosman studied drawing under [[Randolph Schwabe]] and [[lithography]] under [[Harold Jones (artist)|Harold Jones]].&lt;ref name=Hopkinson&gt;{{cite web |author=Amanda Hopkinson|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/04/milein-cosman-obituary |title=Milein Cosman obituary |date=4 December 2017|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 she attended evening classes at [[Oxford Polytechnic]], where she was taught by [[Bernard Meninsky]].&lt;ref name=Hopkinson/&gt; In the same year she started teaching French and Art at a convent school as well as giving lectures on Art for the [[Workers' Educational Association]] (WEA).

In 1946, Cosman moved to London. She began book illustration and working as a freelance artist, while continuing to teach evening classes for the WEA and working for the [[American Broadcasting Station in Europe]]. She contributed drawings to national and international magazines and newspapers, including the BBC’s ''[[Radio Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Hopkinson/&gt;&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buckman|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|year=2006|title=Artists in Britain Since 1945 Vol 1, A to L |ISBN=0 953260 95 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly noteworthy is a commission from ''[[Heute (Zeitschrift)|Heute]]'' to draw [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s post-war cabinet in Germany 1949.

In 1947, Cosman met the Viennese-born musician, writer, broadcaster and teacher [[Hans Keller]] (1919-1985), whom she married in 1961.&lt;ref name=Hopkinson/&gt;&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; Some books of his writings – ''The Jerusalem Diary'' (2001), ''Stravinsky The Music Maker'' (2010) and ''Britten'' (2013), for example – include many of her drawings and prints.

Milein Cosman made a series of schools programmes on drawing for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=Hopkinson/&gt; In all, she has had nearly 30 solo exhibitions in the UK and abroad and her work has been acquired by many leading museums including the [[British Museum]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]], the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] in Cambridge, the [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]] in Glasgow, the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels|Palais des Beaux-Arts]] in Brussels and the [[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin|Kupferstichkabinett]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name=Lebrecht&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=https://www.lebrecht.co.uk/blog/?p=10788 |title=Milein Cosman obituary |year=2017|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=Music + Arts Pictures at Lebrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was renowned for drawing quickly, and much of her work was done from the wings or auditorium during rehearsals for concerts, theatrical and dance performances, capturing movement “in mid-flight” as [[Ernst Gombrich]] put it.

In 2006, Cosman founded the Cosman Keller Art and Music Trust, which aims to support young musicians and artists as well as publishing, exhibiting and archiving her own and Hans Keller’s work.&lt;ref name=Hopkinson/&gt; In 2014, a documentary film on Milein Cosman made by Christoph Böll was premiered in Düsseldorf in her presence.&lt;ref name=Hopkinson/&gt;

She died in November 2017.&lt;ref name=Lebrecht/&gt;

'''Minhwa''' refers to [[Culture of Korea|Korean]] [[folk art]] produced mostly by itinerant or unknown artists without formal training, emulating contemporary trends in fine art for the purpose of everyday use or decoration.&lt;ref name="Beauty"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Korean Culture and Information Service|title=Korean Beauty|date=2011|publisher=길잡이미디어|isbn=9788973751204|page=272|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjVvBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA272#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "minhwa" was coined by [[Yanagi Muneyoshi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=민화 |url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/kr/topic/%EB%AF%BC%ED%99%94/6572 |website=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture |publisher=National Folk Museum of Korea |accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literally "painting of the people" or "popular painting". This type of painting was often the work of anonymous craftsmen who faithfully adhered to the styles, canons and genres inherited from the past. Minhwa also involved a magical dimension. They were believed to possess beneficial virtues and to protect the owner and his family from evil forces. They feature popular themes such as cranes, rocks, water, clouds, the sun, moon, pine-trees, tortoises, insects and flowers.

''Minhwa'' art developed into its present form in the seventeenth century.  The artists were common people who went from place to place, often following festivals, where they would paint for the locals, fulfilling their [[Commission (art)|commissions]] on the spot.  Important stages in life were also marked by the painting of a minhwa picture.  Both common people and nobles would commission these artists.

The paintings worked on a number of levels.  They show figures from folk mythology and legends, symbols of happiness, wealth and health, and scenes of everyday life.  The most common figures were animals that represented power, such as the tiger, or providential circumstances, such as carp, which represent success. The paintings were done on paper and on canvas.  

After a decline during the colonial rule, the art form experienced a short boom until laid low by the [[Korean War]].  In the 1980s, though, there was a revival of Minhwa, the interest and popularity of which persists to this day.

==Genres==
===Magpie and tiger===
{{see also|Tigers in Korean culture}}
''Kkachi horangi'' ({{Korean|hangul=까치호랑이|labels=no}}) is a prominent genre of ''minhwa'' that depicts magpies and tigers. In ''kkachi horangi'' paintings, the tiger, which is intentionally given a ridiculous and stupid appearance (hence its nickname "idiot tiger" 바보호랑이), represents authority and the aristocratic [[yangban]], while the dignified magpie represents the common man. Hence, ''kkachi horangi'' paintings of magpies and tigers were a satire of the hierarchical structure of Joseon's feudal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=까치호랑이|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/kr/topic/%EA%B9%8C%EC%B9%98%ED%98%B8%EB%9E%91%EC%9D%B4/6565|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture|publisher=National Folk Museum of Korea|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=KOREA Magazine March 2017|date=2017|publisher=Korean Culture and Information Service|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3M-DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flower writing===
''Munjado'' ({{Korean|hangul=문자도|hanja=文字圖|labels=no}}), also known as "flower writing" ({{Korean|hangul=꽃글씨|rr=kkotgeulssi|labels=no}}), is a genre of ''minhwa'' that enjoyed popularity in the 18th and 19th centuries, in which large Chinese characters associated with Confucian philosophy are painted as a representation of their meaning, with depictions of related stories and themes painted into the characters themselves.&lt;ref name="Beauty" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=효제문자도|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/kr/topic/%ED%9A%A8%EC%A0%9C%EB%AC%B8%EC%9E%90%EB%8F%84/6603|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture|publisher=National Folk Museum of Korea|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chaekgeori===
''[[Chaekgeori]]'' is a genre of still-life painting that features books as the dominant subject. Originally a court art embraced by the upper class, ''chaekgeori'' spread to the ''minhwa'' folk art of the common class in the 19th century, resulting in more expressionist and abstract depictions, and the diminished prominence of bookshelves as a primary motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=책거리|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/kr/topic/%EC%B1%85%EA%B1%B0%EB%A6%AC/6591|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture|publisher=National Folk Museum of Korea|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2843">'''Mongol Shuudan''' ({{lang-ru|Монгол Шуудан}}, {{IPA-ru|mɐŋˈɡol ʂuːˈdan|}}) is a rock band formed in [[Moscow]], in 1988.

"Монгол Шуудан" means "[[Mongol Post]]" in the [[Mongolian language]]. This unusual choice is explained by the band vocalist Valeri Skoroded very simply: the band was standing at a [[bus stop]] by a {{illm|Soyuzpechat|WD=Q4261829|reasonator=1}} booth and their eyes were caught by fancy [[postage stamps]] with the exotic words "Монгол Шуудан" ({{IPA-mn|ˈmɔŋkɔɮ ˈʃuːtɑŋ|}}) on them. (Note: Mongolian is written in [[Cyrillic script]].) 

The group's music was mostly anti-governmental, pro-anarchist in its message, with the group identifying themselves with the [[Black Guards]] of the [[Russian Civil War]]. More accurately, Mongol Shuudan associated themselves with the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]], the peasant-anarchist guerrilla army led by [[Nestor Makhno]].  

Many of their songs are modernized versions of anarchist civil war songs. Some of their songs include "[[Commissar]]," "[[Chekism|Chekist]]," "Freedom or Death," "[[Sabbath (witchcraft)|Sabbath]] on the [[Lysa Hora (folklore)|Bald Mountain]]", and so forth. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the group has continued to produce music, much of which is available  on their website. 

The band has performed over 100 shows and toured Europe, Israel, and all of the Russian Federation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2215">'''Peintre-graveur''' ({{IPA-fr|pɛ̃tʁ ɡʁavœʁ}}) is a term probably invented and certainly popularized by the great scholar of the [[old master print]],  [[Adam Bartsch]] (Johann Adam Bernhard von Bartsch: 1757 - 1821, both Vienna).  The term, meaning "painter-engraver", is intended to distinguish between [[printmaker]]s, whether working in [[engraving]], [[etching]] or [[woodcut]], who designed images with the primary purpose of producing a print, and those who essentially copied in a print medium a composition by another, to produce what is known as a "reproductive print", or who produced only essentially non-artistic work in print form, such as [[map]]s for example. 

"Painter-engraver" is sometimes used in English.  Alternative terms for the work of a Peintre-graveur are "artist's print", "original print", "graphic art". "Art print" now tends to mean a reproduction of any work of art.  

Bartsch's great catalogue of [[old master print]]s, published in Vienna in 21 volumes in 1803-21,was called "Le Peintre Graveur".  It has been reprinted five times, most recently in 1982.  ''The Illustrated Bartsch'' ([[Abaris books|Abaris Books]], New York) is an English language illustrated version (the original was unillustrated by technological necessity) which released the first volume in 1978, and is projected to include at least 164 volumes. Most of the picture volumes are published; the accompanying text volumes, in effect complete new [[Catalogue raisonné|catalogues raissonés]], are taking longer. It (currently Abaris Books has granted a non-exclusive license for many of the images found in ''The Illustrated Bartsch'' and they are available online to colleges and other institutions subscribing to [[ARTstor]].

==History==
The Prešeren Award was for the first time bestowed in 1947, on the basis of a decree from 1946. It was originally given on 8 February, [[Prešeren Day]], the holiday commemorating the anniversary of the death of the Slovene [[national poet]] [[France Prešeren]].&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; In 1955, the first act on the Prešeren awards was passed. By it, the award gained its current name and the Prešeren Fund was established, which by the amendments of the act in 1956 became a legal personality.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; Since 1961, the awards were conferred also for the lifetime work. In addition, the Prešeren Fund Award was introduced.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; Since that year, these awards have been conferred only for exceptional achievements in the field of arts. In 1982, the Prešeren Fund came under the auspice of the [[Cultural Community of Slovenia]]. At most three Prešeren Awards and ten Prešeren Fund Awards were given.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; Since 1991, when the ''Prešeren Award Act'' ({{lang|sl|Zakon o Prešernovi nagradi}}) was passed,&lt;ref name="ZUODNO-G"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pisrs.si/Predpis.aspx?id=ZAKO866&amp;pogled=osnovni |title=Zakon o Prešernovi nagradi (ZPreN) Ur.l. RS, št. 29I/1991) |accessdate=19 April 2011 |work=PisRS |publisher=Office of Legislation, Slovenia}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fund works under the auspice of the Slovenian administrative body in charge of culture.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; According to the act, at most two awards may be given.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt;

==Prešeren Fund==
The Prešeren Award and the Prešeren Fund Award are bestowed by the Prešeren Fund Management Board ({{lang|sl|Upravni odbor Prešernovega sklada}}). Its 15 members are artists or other cultural workers, like critics, historians, and theoreticians. They are nominated by the [[Slovenian Government]] and elected for a four-year term by the [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly of Slovenia]]. The board, which was last elected in May 2008, elected [[Jaroslav Skrušny]] as its chair in July 2008.&lt;ref name="STA2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ms.sta.si/2011/09/prva-seja-upravnega-odbora-presernovega-sklada-v-kranju/ |title=Prva seja upravnega odbora Prešernovega sklada v Kranju |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The First Session of the Prešeren Fund Management Board in Kranj |date=22 September 2011 |newspaper=Misli slovensko [Think Slovene] |publisher=Slovenian Press Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130418153027/http://ms.sta.si/2011/09/prva-seja-upravnega-odbora-presernovega-sklada-v-kranju/ |archivedate=18 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prešeren Fund now operates under the auspice of the [[Ministry of Culture (Slovenia)|Slovenian Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref name="Fund2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mk.gov.si/en/about_the_ministry/expert_committees_counsels_and_funds/preseren_fund/ |title=Prešeren Fund |publisher=Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417131925/http://www.mk.gov.si/en/about_the_ministry/expert_committees_counsels_and_funds/preseren_fund/ |archivedate=17 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in February 2012, Skrušny described the work by the Board as independent and denied any political pressure in the past few years.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt;

==Selection and proclamation of the winners==
On 10 February, the Prešeren Fund announces a public tender, which lasts until 15 September. Any physical or legal person may nominate authors for the award, but have to provide appropriate rationale and references.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt; About 100 proposals are put forward each year,&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt; the majority of proposals from the [[performing arts]].&lt;ref name="STA2011" /&gt;  The selection is based on artistic value of the works by the proposed artists as well as other criteria, such as the equal representation of gender, regions, generations, and world views, trying to achieve a balanced and plural choice. Both the established artists and debitants have won the award. The nominees are then selected by the four field committees of the Prešeren Fund, each comprising seven members named by the Prešeren Fund Management Board. Each committee proposes two names for the Prešeren Award and six names for the Prešeren Fund Award, altogether eight for the great award and 24 for the little award. The board then makes the final selection with a secret vote in November after a long discussion and proclaims the awardees after they are elected by two thirds of members. If necessary, more voting rounds may take place. Although in the past, the names of the awardees were announced already on 3 December, the date of the anniversary of Prešeren's births, in the last years they have remained secret until the award ceremony.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt;

==Review of the awardees==
Since Slovenian declaration of independence in 1991, the majority of the Prešeren Award winners have been literary artists, among them the only woman being Makarovič, who declined the award in 2000 but accepted the money.&lt;ref name="Planet2011-06"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.siol.net/novice/poglobljeno/2011/06/dvajset_let_umetnosti_v_sloveniji.aspx |title=Dvajset let umetnosti v Sloveniji |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Twenty Years of Art in Slovenia |newspaper=Planet Siol.net |publisher=TSMedia d. o. o. |date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the field of performing arts, only two artists won the award. From the field of music, the awardees have been mainly composers and conductors, with the only instrumentalist being the flautist [[Irena Grafenauer]]. A general trend of older men active in [[institution]]alised arts is recognisable among the awardees. The group of the Prešeren Fund Award winners is more diverse.&lt;ref name="Planet2011-06" /&gt;

'''Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dalí i Domènech, 1st Marquis of Dalí de Púbol''' (11 May 1904{{spaced ndash}}23 January 1989), known professionally as '''Salvador Dalí''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑː|l|i|,_|d|ɑː|ˈ|l|i}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dali "Dali"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dali "Dali"]. ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-ca|səlβəˈðo ðəˈli|lang}}; {{IPA-es|salβaˈðoɾ ðaˈli|lang}}), was a prominent Spanish [[Surrealism|surrealist]] born in [[Figueres]], [[Catalonia]], Spain.

Dalí was a skilled [[Technical drawing|draftsman]], best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work. His [[Painterliness|painterly]] skills are often attributed to the influence of [[Renaissance]] masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/feature-2005-03.html |title=Phelan, Joseph; The Salvador Dalí Show |publisher=Artcyclopedia.com |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dali&gt;Dalí, Salvador. (2000) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=on_YUj9IP8UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dalí: 16 Art Stickers]'', Courier Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0486410749}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931. Dalí's expansive artistic repertoire included film, sculpture, and photography, at times in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media.

Dalí attributed his "love of everything that is gilded and excessive, my passion for luxury and my love of oriental clothes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ian Gibson | title=The Shameful Life of Salvador Dalí | year=1997 | publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company | url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/g/gibson-dali.html }} Gibson found out that "Dalí" (and its many variants) is an extremely common surname in Arab countries like [[Morocco]], Tunisia, [[Algeria]] or [[Egypt]]. On the other hand, also according to Gibson, Dalí's mother's family, the Domènech of Barcelona, had Jewish roots.&lt;/ref&gt; to an "Arab lineage", claiming that his ancestors were descendants of the [[Moors]].&lt;ref name="Meisler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-571-19380-3"&gt;Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 238–39&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalí was highly imaginative, and also enjoyed indulging in unusual and grandiose behavior. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric manner and attention-grabbing public actions sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dalí |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meisler&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dalí|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=2014-07-12|date=April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalí attended [[art school|drawing school]]. In 1916, he also discovered modern painting on a summer vacation trip to Cadaqués with the family of [[Ramon Pichot]], a local artist who made regular trips to Paris.&lt;ref name=Llongueras /&gt; The next year, Dalí's father organized an exhibition of his charcoal drawings in their family home. He had his first public exhibition at the Municipal Theatre in Figueres in 1919, a site he would return to decades later.

On 6 February 1921, Dalí's mother died of [[cancer of the uterus|uterus cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Dalí was 16 years old; he later said his mother's death "was the greatest blow I had experienced in my life.

[[File:Man Ray Salvador Dali.jpg|thumb|left|Dalí (left) and fellow [[surrealism|surrealist]] artist [[Man Ray]] in Paris on 16 June 1934]]
In 1922, Dalí moved into the [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] (Students' Residence) in [[Madrid]]&lt;ref name=Llongueras /&gt; and studied at the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]. A lean {{convert|1.72|m|ftin|frac=8}} tall,&lt;ref&gt;As listed in [http://www.gaudiclub.com/esp/e_links/dali/2004mar18_1.asp his prison record of 1924], aged 20. However, his hairdresser and biographer, Luis Llongueras, stated Dalí was {{convert|1.74|m|ftin|frac=8}} tall.&lt;/ref&gt; Dalí already drew attention as an eccentric and [[dandy]]. He had long hair and [[sideburn]]s, coat, stockings, and [[knee-breeches]] in the style of English [[artistic dress movement|aesthetes]] of the late 19th century.

At the Residencia, he became close friends with (among others) [[Pepín Bello]], [[Luis Buñuel]], and [[Federico García Lorca]]. The friendship with Lorca had a strong element of mutual passion,&lt;ref&gt;For more in-depth information about the Lorca-Dalí connection see ''Lorca-Dalí: el amor que no pudo ser'' and ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dalí'', both by [[Ian Gibson (author)|Ian Gibson]].&lt;/ref&gt; but Dalí rejected the poet's sexual advances.&lt;ref name="conversations"&gt;Bosquet, Alain, ''[http://www.ubu.com/historical/dali/dali_conversations.pdf Conversations with Dalí]'', 1969. pp. 19–20. (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Salvador Dalí, Federico García Lorca, Barcelona, 1925.jpg|thumb|Dalí with [[Federico García Lorca]], Turó Park de la Guineueta, Barcelona, 1925]]
It was his paintings in which he experimented with [[Cubism]], however, that earned him the most attention from his fellow students. Since there were no Cubist artists in Madrid at the time, his knowledge of Cubist art had come from magazine articles and a catalog given to him by Pichot.

Dalí, still unknown to the public, illustrated a book for the first time in 1924. It was a publication of the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] poem ''Les bruixes de [[Llers]]'' ("The Witches of Llers") by his friend and schoolmate, poet [[Carles Fages de Climent]]. Dalí also experimented with [[Dada]], which influenced his work throughout his life.&lt;ref name="Dali Dada"&gt;''La dada fotogràfica'', Gaseta de les Arts, n° 6, February 1929&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalí held his first solo exhibition at [[Galeries Dalmau]] in Barcelona, from 14 to 27 November 1925.&lt;ref name="Fèlix Fanés"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=bDpziok_K7gC&amp;dq=galeries+dalmau&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Fèlix Fanés, ''Salvador Dalí: The Construction of the Image, 1925-1930''], Yale University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0300091796}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.girona.cat/viewer.vm?id=2934417&amp;view=dalmau&amp;lang=en Exposició Salvador Dalí, Galeries Dalmau, 14–28 November 1925, exhibition catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Dalí was not yet immersed in the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] style for which he would later become famous. The exhibition was well received by the public and critics. The following year he exhibited again at Galeries Dalmau, from 31 December 1926 to 14 January 1927, with the support of the art critic {{Ill|Sebastià Gasch|es}}.&lt;ref name="Pàmies"&gt;[https://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/handle/10230/22029/Andres_13.pdf?sequence=1 Elisenda Andrés Pàmies, ''Les Galeries Dalmau, un projecte de modernitat a la ciutat de Barcelona''], 2012-13, Facultat d’Humanitats, Universitat Pompeu Fabra&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.girona.cat/viewer.vm?id=2934087&amp;view=dalmau&amp;lang=en Exposició de Salvador Dalí, Galeries Dalmau, Passeig de Gràcia, 31 December 1926 – 14 January 1927, exhibition catalogue (other version)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalí left the Academy in 1926, shortly before his final exams.&lt;ref name="Meisler" /&gt; His mastery of painting skills at that time was evidenced by his realistic ''[[The Basket of Bread]]'', painted in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dali-gallery.com/html/galleries/painting05.htm |title=Paintings Gallery No.&amp;nbsp;5 |publisher=Dali-gallery.com |accessdate=August 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827234135/http://www.dali-gallery.com/html/galleries/painting05.htm |archivedate=27 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he made his first visit to Paris, where he met [[Pablo Picasso]], whom the young Dalí revered.&lt;ref name="Meisler" /&gt; Picasso had already heard favorable reports about Dalí from [[Joan Miró]], a fellow Catalan who introduced him to many Surrealist friends.&lt;ref name="Meisler" /&gt; As he developed his own style over the next few years, Dalí made a number of works strongly influenced by Picasso and Miró.

Some trends in Dalí's work that would continue throughout his life were already evident in the 1920s. Dalí was influenced by many styles of art, ranging from the most academically classic, to the most cutting-edge [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, Nicola, and Libby Anson.

Exhibitions of his works in [[Barcelona]] attracted much attention and a mixture of praise and puzzled debate from critics.

Dalí grew a flamboyant [[moustache]], influenced by 17th-century Spanish master painter [[Diego Velázquez]]. This moustache became an iconic trademark of his appearance for the rest of his life.

=== 1929 to World War II ===
[[File:Salvador Dalí, 1934 (photo by Carl Van Vechten).jpeg|thumb|Salvador Dalí]]
In 1929, Dalí collaborated with surrealist film director [[Luis Buñuel]] on the short film {{lang|fr|[[Un Chien Andalou]]}} (''An Andalusian Dog''). His main contribution was to help Buñuel write the script for the film. Dalí later claimed to have also played a significant role in the filming of the project, but this is not substantiated by contemporary accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Koller |first=Michael |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/01/12/chien.html |language=fr |title=Un Chien Andalou |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225061923/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/01/12/chien.html |archive-date=25 December 2010 |work=Senses of Cinema |date=January 2001 |access-date=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in August 1929, Dalí met his lifelong and primary [[muse]] and future wife [[Gala Dalí|Gala]],&lt;ref name=unbound&gt;Shelley, Landry. [http://www.tcnj.edu/~unbound/spring2005/articles/a2 "Dalí Wows Crowd in Philadelphia"]. ''Unbound'' ([[The College of New Jersey]]) Spring 2005. Retrieved on July 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova. She was a Russian immigrant ten years his senior, who at that time was married to surrealist poet [[Paul Éluard]]. In the same year, Dalí had important professional exhibitions and officially joined the Surrealist group in the [[Montparnasse]] quarter of Paris. His work had already been heavily influenced by surrealism for two years. The Surrealists hailed what Dalí called his [[paranoiac-critical method]] of accessing the [[subconscious]] for greater artistic creativity.&lt;ref name=Llongueras /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rojas /&gt;

Meanwhile, Dalí's relationship with his father was close to rupture. Don Salvador Dalí y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala, and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals. The final straw was when Don Salvador read in a Barcelona newspaper that his son had recently exhibited in Paris a drawing of the ''Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ'', with a provocative inscription: "Sometimes, I spit for fun on my mother's portrait".&lt;ref name="Meisler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-571-19380-3"&gt;Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 238–39&lt;/ref&gt;

Outraged, Don Salvador demanded that his son recant publicly. Dalí refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqués again. The following summer, Dalí and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]]. He bought the place, and over the years enlarged it by buying the neighbouring fishermen cabins, gradually building his much beloved [[villa]] by the sea. Dalí's father would eventually relent and come to accept his son's companion.&lt;ref name=GalaGSDF&gt;{{cite web|title=Gala Biography|url=http://www.salvador-dali.org/dali/en_biografia-gala.html|work=Dalí|publisher=Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation|accessdate=27 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626181620/http://www.salvador-dali.org/dali/en_biografia-gala.html|archive-date=26 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Dalí painted one of his most famous works, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salvadordalimuseum.org/education/documents/clocking_in.pdf Clocking in with Salvador Dalí: Salvador Dalí's Melting Watches] (PDF) from the Salvador Dalí Museum. Retrieved on August 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced a surrealistic image of soft, melting [[pocket watch]]es. The general interpretation of the work is that the soft watches are a rejection of the assumption that time is rigid or [[determinism|deterministic]]. This idea is supported by other images in the work, such as the wide expanding landscape, and other limp watches shown being devoured by ants.&lt;ref name=Conquete&gt;Salvador Dalí, {{lang|fr|La Conquête de l'irrationnel}} (Paris: Éditions surréalistes, 1935), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalí and Gala, having lived together since 1929, were civilly married on 30 January 1934 in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; They later remarried in a Church ceremony on 8 August 1958 at [[Sant Martí Vell]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 492&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to inspiring many artworks throughout her life, Gala would act as Dalí's [[business manager]], supporting their extravagant lifestyle while adeptly steering clear of insolvency. Gala seemed to tolerate Dalí's dalliances with younger muses, secure in her own position as his primary relationship. Dalí continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her. The "tense, complex and ambiguous relationship" lasting over 50 years would later become the subject of an opera, ''Jo, Dalí'' (''I, Dalí'') by [[Catalan people|Catalan]] composer Xavier Benguerel.&lt;ref name=Opera&gt;{{cite web|last=Amengual|first=Margalida|title=An opera on the relationship between Salvador Dalí and Gala arrives at Barcelona's Liceu|url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/culture/item/an-opera-on-the-relationship-between-salvador-dali-and-gala-arrives-at-barcelonas-liceu|work=Catalan News Agency (CNA)|publisher=Intracatalònia, SA|accessdate=27 May 2012|date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalí was introduced to the United States by art dealer [[Julien Levy]] in 1934. The exhibition in New York of Dalí's works, including ''Persistence of Memory'', created an immediate sensation. [[Social Register]] listees feted him at a specially organized "Dalí Ball". He showed up wearing a glass case on his chest, which contained a brassiere.&lt;ref&gt;Current Biography 1940, pp. 219–20&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Dalí and Gala also attended a masquerade party in New York, hosted for them by heiress [[Caresse Crosby]], the inventor of the brassiere. For their costumes, they dressed as the [[Lindbergh baby]] and his [[Bruno Hauptmann|kidnapper]]. The resulting uproar in the press was so great that Dalí apologized. When he returned to Paris, the Surrealists confronted him about his apology for a surrealist act.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Buñuel, ''My Last Sigh: The Autobiography of Luis Buñuel'', Vintage 1984. {{ISBN|0816643873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the majority of the Surrealist artists had become increasingly associated with [[leftist]] politics, Dalí maintained an ambiguous position on the subject of the proper relationship between politics and art. Leading surrealist [[André Breton]] accused Dalí of defending the "new" and "irrational" in "the Hitler phenomenon", but Dalí quickly rejected this claim, saying, "I am Hitlerian neither in fact nor intention".&lt;ref&gt;Greeley, Robin Adèle (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2w1QddhP56wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Surrealism and the Spanish Civil War]'', Yale University Press. p. 81. {{ISBN|0300112955}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dalí insisted that surrealism could exist in an apolitical context and refused to explicitly denounce [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MORRDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62&amp;lpg=PT62|title=The Creative Underground : Art, Politics and Everyday Life|last=Clements|first=Paul|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=2016|isbn=978-1317501282|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other factors, this had landed him in trouble with his colleagues. Later in 1934, Dalí was subjected to a "trial", in which he narrowly avoided being expelled from the Surrealist group.&lt;ref&gt;Shanes, Eric (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eDQqcrMy8M8C&amp;pg=PA53 The Life and Masterworks of Salvador Dalí]''. Parkstone. p. 53. {{ISBN|1780428790}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To this, Dalí retorted, "The difference between the surrealists and me is, I myself am surrealism" (''la différence entre les surréalistes et moi, c'est que moi je suis surréaliste'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=vYcGAAAAMAAJ Salvador Dalí, Louis Pauwels, ''Les passions selon Dalí''], Denoël, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=ub6fAAAAMAAJ Pierre Ajame, ''La Double vie de Salvador Dali: récit''], Éditions Ramsay, 1984, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Dalí took part in the [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]]. His lecture, titled {{lang|fr|Fantômes paranoiaques authentiques}}, was delivered while wearing a deep-sea [[diving suit]] and helmet.&lt;ref&gt;Jackaman, Rob. (1989) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DV9_6DAOSscC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Course of English Surrealist Poetry Since the 1930s]'', Edwin Mellen Press. {{ISBN|0889469326}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He had arrived carrying a [[billiard cue]] and leading a pair of [[Russian wolfhound]]s, and had to have the helmet unscrewed as he gasped for breath. He commented that "I just wanted to show that I was 'plunging deeply' into the human mind."&lt;ref&gt;Current Biography 1940, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Dalí, aged 32, was featured on the cover of ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Meisler" /&gt;

Also in 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dalí became famous for another incident. Levy's program of short surrealist films was timed to take place at the same time as the first surrealism exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], featuring Dalí's work. Dalí was in the audience at the screening, but halfway through the film, he knocked over the projector in a rage. "My idea for a film is exactly that, and I was going to propose it to someone who would pay to have it made", he said. "I never wrote it down or told anyone, but it is as if he had stolen it". Other versions of Dalí's accusation tend to the more poetic: "He stole it from my subconscious!" or even "He stole my dreams!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andel.home.mindspring.com/cornell_notes.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408200021/http://andel.home.mindspring.com/cornell_notes.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 8, 2005 |title=Program Notes by Andy Ditzler (2005) and Deborah Solomon, ''Utopia Parkway: The Life of Joseph Cornell'' (New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2003) |publisher=Andel.home.mindspring.com |accessdate=August 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period, Dalí's main patron in London was the wealthy [[Edward James]]. He had helped Dalí emerge into the art world by purchasing many works and by supporting him financially for two years. They also collaborated on two of the most enduring icons of the Surrealist movement: the ''[[Lobster Telephone]]'' and the ''[[Mae West Lips Sofa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=2607|title=Salvador Dali Lobster Telephone|last=|first=|date=August 1994|website=National Gallery of Australia|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Spain was going through [[Spanish Civil War|a civil war]] (1936–1939), with many artists taking a side or going into exile.

In 1938, Dalí met [[Sigmund Freud]] thanks to [[Stefan Zweig]]. Dalí started to sketch Freud's portrait, while the 82-year-old celebrity confided to others that "This boy looks like a fanatic." Dalí was delighted upon hearing later about this comment from his hero.&lt;ref name="Meisler" /&gt;

Later, in September 1938, Salvador Dalí was invited by Gabrielle [[Coco Chanel]] to her house "[[La Pausa]]" in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]] on the [[French Riviera]]. There he painted numerous paintings he later exhibited at Julien Levy Gallery in New York.&lt;ref&gt;''Salvador Dalí Exhibition'', Exhibition Catalogue – February 16 through May 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philadelphia.about.com/od/salvador_dali/a/salvador_dali_a.htm |title=Salvador Dali Exhibition |work=[[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075359/http://philadelphia.about.com/od/salvador_dali/a/salvador_dali_a.htm |archive-date=7 July 2011 |access-date=12 May 2014 |last=Fischer |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 20th century, "La Pausa" was partially replicated at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]] to welcome the Reeves collection and part of Chanel's original furniture for the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Impressionist paintings, drawings, and sculpture from the Wendy and Emery Reeves Collection |first=Richard R. |last=Bretell |year=1995 |publisher=Dallas Museum of Art |isbn= 978-0936227153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1938, Dalí unveiled ''[[Rainy Taxi]]'', a three-dimensional artwork, consisting of an actual automobile with two [[mannequin]] occupants. The piece was first displayed at the Galerie Beaux-Arts in Paris at the [[Exposition Internationale du Surréalisme]], organised by [[André Breton]] and [[Paul Éluard]].

At the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], Dalí debuted his ''Dream of Venus'' surrealist pavilion, located in the Amusements Area of the exposition. It featured bizarre sculptures, statues, and live nude models in "costumes" made of fresh seafood, an event photographed by [[Horst P. Horst]], [[George Platt Lynes]] and [[Murray Korman]]. Like most attractions in the Amusements Area, an admission fee was charged.&lt;ref name="DrmVns" /&gt;

In 1939, André Breton coined the derogatory nickname "Avida Dollars", an [[anagram]] for "Salvador Dalí", a phonetic rendering of the French phrase ''avide à dollars'', meaning "eager for dollars".&lt;ref name=artcyclopedia&gt;[http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/dali_salvador.html Artcyclopedia: Salvador Dalí]. Retrieved September 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a derisive reference to the increasing commercialization of Dalí's work, and the perception that Dalí sought self-aggrandizement through fame and fortune. The Surrealists, many of whom were closely connected to the [[French Communist Party]] at the time, expelled him from their movement.&lt;ref name="Meisler" /&gt; Some surrealists henceforth spoke of Dalí in the past tense, as if he were dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philipcoppens.com/dali.html|title=Salvador Dali: painting the fourth dimension|last=Coppens|first=Philip|date=|website=PhilipCoppins.com|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Surrealist movement and various members thereof (such as [[Ted Joans]]) would continue to issue extremely harsh [[polemics]] against Dalí until the time of his death, and beyond.

=== World War II ===
In 1940, as [[World War II]] tore through Europe, Dalí and Gala retreated to the United States, where they lived for eight years splitting their time between New York and Monterey, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/cover/a-world-class-salvador-dali-art-collection-comes-to-monterey/article_b1267eae-db3d-11e5-9e95-3f5ae7bc3619.html|title=A world-class Salvador Dali art collection comes to Monterey.|last=Schmalz|first=David|website=Monterey County Weekly|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were able to escape because on June 20, 1940, they were issued visas by [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], Portuguese consul in Bordeaux, France. Salvador and Gala Dalí crossed into Portugal and subsequently sailed on the ''Excambion'' from Lisbon to New York in August 1940. Dalí’s arrival in New York was one of the catalysts in the development of that city as a world art center in the [[post-war]] years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sousamendesfoundation.org/dali/ |title=Dali |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102223907/http://sousamendesfoundation.org/dali/ |archive-date=2 November 2013 |work=Sousa Mendes Foundation |date=20 June 1940 |access-date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the move, Dalí returned to the practice of [[Catholicism]]. "During this period, Dalí never stopped writing", wrote Robert and Nicolas Descharnes.&lt;ref name="Descharnes (1993) p. 35."&gt;Descharnes, Robert and Nicolas. ''Salvador Dalí''. New York: Konecky &amp; Konecky, 1993. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalí worked prolifically in a variety of media during this period, designing jewelry, clothes, furniture, stage sets for plays and ballet, and retail store display windows. In 1939, while working on a window display for [[Bonwit Teller]], he became so enraged by unauthorized changes to his work that he shoved a decorative bathtub through a plate glass window.&lt;ref name="Meisler" /&gt;

Dali spent the winter of 1940–41 at Hampton Manor, the residence of bra designer and patron of the arts [[Caresse Crosby]], near Bowling Green in [[Caroline County, Virginia]]. During his time there, he spent his time on various projects. He was described as a "showman" by residents in the local newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virginialiving.com/%C2%A1hola,-dal%C3%AD!/ |title=¡Hola, Dalí! |last1=Crowder |first1=Bland |date=January 31, 2014 |website=[[Virginia Living]] |publisher=Cape Fear Publishing |access-date=June 27, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Dalí drafted a film scenario for [[Jean Gabin]] called ''Moontide''. In 1942, he published his autobiography, ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí]]''. He wrote catalogs for his exhibitions, such as that at the Knoedler Gallery in New York in 1943, in which he attacked some often-used surrealist techniques by proclaiming, "Surrealism will at least have served to give experimental proof that total sterility and attempts at automatizations have gone too far and have led to a totalitarian system. ... Today's laziness and the total lack of technique have reached their paroxysm in the psychological signification of the current use of the college" ([[collage]]). He also wrote a novel, published in 1944, about a fashion salon for automobiles. This resulted in a drawing by Edwin Cox in ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', depicting Dalí dressing an automobile in an evening gown.&lt;ref name="Descharnes (1993) p. 35."/&gt;

In ''The Secret Life'', Dalí suggested that he had split with [[Luis Buñuel]] because the latter was a [[Communist]] and an [[atheist]]. Buñuel was fired (or resigned) from his position at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MOMA), supposedly after [[Cardinal Spellman]] of New York went to see [[Iris Barry]], head of the film department at MOMA. Buñuel then went back to Hollywood where he worked in the dubbing department of [[Warner Brothers]] from 1942 to 1946. In his 1982 autobiography ''Mon Dernier soupir'' (''My Last Sigh'', 1983), Buñuel wrote that, over the years, he had rejected Dalí's attempts at reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Buñuel, ''My Last Sigh: The Autobiography of Luis Buñuel'' (Vintage, 1984) {{ISBN|0816643873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Italian [[friar]], Gabriele Maria Berardi, claimed to have performed an [[exorcism]] on Dalí while he was in France in 1947.&lt;ref name="exorcist-gift"&gt;[http://cathnews.acu.edu.au/510/72.php Dalí's gift to exorcist uncovered] ''Catholic News'', October 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a sculpture of Christ on the Cross was discovered in the friar's estate. It had been claimed that Dalí gave this work to his exorcist out of gratitude,&lt;ref name="exorcist-gift"/&gt; and two Spanish art experts confirmed that there were adequate stylistic reasons to believe the sculpture was made by Dalí.&lt;ref name="exorcist-gift"/&gt;

=== Later years in Spain ===
[[File:Dali Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Dalí by [[Allan Warren]], 1972]]
In 1948 Dalí and Gala moved back into their house in Port Lligat, on the coast near Cadaqués. For the next three decades, he would spend most of his time there painting, taking time off and spending winters with his wife in Paris and New York.&lt;ref name="Meisler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GalaGSDF" /&gt; His acceptance and implicit embrace of [[Spain under Franco|Franco's dictatorship]] were strongly disapproved of by other Spanish artists and intellectuals who remained in exile.

In 1959, [[André Breton]] organized an exhibit called ''Homage to Surrealism'', celebrating the fortieth anniversary of Surrealism, which contained works by Dalí, [[Joan Miró]], [[Enrique Tábara]], and [[Eugenio Granell]]. Breton vehemently fought against the inclusion of Dalí's ''Sistine Madonna'' in the International Surrealism Exhibition in New York the following year.&lt;ref name=lopez&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Ignacio Javier López|es|3=Ignacio Javier López}}. ''The Old Age of William Tell (A study of Buñuel's ''Tristana'')''. ''[[MLN]]'' 116 (2001): 295–314.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in his career Dalí did not confine himself to painting, but explored many unusual or novel media and processes: for example, he experimented with [[bulletism|bulletist]] artworks.&lt;ref name=bp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/Articles/Museums_and_Sights/The_Phantasmagoric_Universe_%E2%80%94_Espace_Dal%C3%AD_%C3%80_Montmartre/ |title=The Phantasmagoric Universe&amp;nbsp;– Espace Dalí À Montmartre |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528084739/http://www.bonjourparis.com/Articles/Museums_and_Sights/The_Phantasmagoric_Universe_%E2%80%94_Espace_Dal%C3%AD_%C3%80_Montmartre/ |archive-date=28 May 2006 |language=fr |work=Bonjour Paris |access-date=August 22, 2006 |author=BP Editor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his late works incorporated [[optical illusion]]s, [[negative space]], [[visual pun]]s and [[trompe l'œil]] visual effects. He also experimented with [[pointillism]], enlarged [[half-tone]] dot grids (a technique which [[Roy Lichtenstein]] would later use), and [[stereoscopic]] images.&lt;ref name="AdesOptical"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ades|first=ed. by Dawn|title=Dalí's optical illusions : [Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, January 21 – March 26, 2000 : Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, April 19 – June 18, 2000 ; Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, July 25 – October 1, 2000]|year=2000|publisher=Yale Univ. Press|location=New Haven, Connecticut|isbn=978-0300081770}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was among the first artists to employ [[holography]] in an artistic manner.&lt;ref name=holo&gt;[http://www.holophile.com/history.htm The History and Development of Holography]. ''Holophile''. Retrieved on August 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In Dalí's later years, young artists such as [[Andy Warhol]] proclaimed him an important influence on [[pop art]].&lt;ref name=warhol&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carnegiemuseums.org/cmag/bk_issue/1998/mayjun/feat2.htm |title=Hello, Dalí |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927105155/http://www.carnegiemuseums.org/cmag/bk_issue/1998/mayjun/feat2.htm |archive-date=27 September 2006 |work=Carnegie Magazine |access-date=August 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalí also developed a keen interest in natural science and [[mathematics and art|mathematics]]. This is manifested in several of his paintings, notably from the 1950s, in which he painted his subjects as composed of [[rhinoceros horn]] shapes. According to Dalí, the rhinoceros horn signifies divine geometry because it grows in a [[logarithmic spiral]]. He linked the rhinoceros to themes of [[chastity]] and to the [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;Elliott H. King in [[Dawn Ades]] (ed.), ''Dalí'', Bompiani Arte, Milan, 2004, p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; Dalí was also fascinated by [[DNA]] and the [[tesseract]] (a four-dimensional cube); an unfolding of a hypercube is featured in the painting ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]''.

At some point, Dalí had a [[glass floor]] installed in a room near his studio in Lligat. He made extensive use of it to study [[foreshortening]], both from above and from below, incorporating dramatic perspectives of figures and objects into his paintings.&lt;ref name="AdesOptical"/&gt;{{rp|17–18, 172}} He also delighted in using the room for entertaining guests and visitors to his house and studio. In many of his paintings, Dalí used [[anamorphosis]], a form of eccentric and exaggerated perspective which distorts objects beyond recognition; however, when seen from a particular skewed viewpoint, a legible depiction emerges. He used the power of this technique to conceal "secret" or "forbidden" images in plain sight.&lt;ref name="AdesOptical"/&gt;{{rp|20–25}}

Dalí's post-World War II period bore the hallmarks of technical virtuosity and an intensifying interest in optical effects, science, and religion. He became an increasingly devout Catholic, while at the same time he had been inspired by the shock of [[Hiroshima]] and the dawning of the "[[atomic age]]". Therefore, Dalí labeled this period "Nuclear [[Christian mysticism|Mysticism]]". In paintings such as ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'' (first version, 1949) and ''Corpus Hypercubus'' (1954), Dalí sought to synthesize Christian [[iconography]] with images of material disintegration inspired by [[nuclear physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html |title=Salvador Dalí Bio, Art on 5th |access-date=July 22, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504050531/http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html |archive-date=4 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Nuclear Mysticism works included such notable pieces as ''[[La Gare de Perpignan]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Hallucinogenic Toreador]]'' (1968–70).

In 1960, Dalí began work on his [[Dalí Theatre and Museum|Theatre and Museum]] in his home town of [[Figueres]]; it was his largest single project and a main focus of his energy through 1974, when it opened. He continued to make additions through the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=Pitxot&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitxot|first=Antoni | authorlink = Antoni Pitxot|title=The Dalí Theatre-Museum|date=2007|publisher=Triangle Postals|location=Sant Lluís, Menorca|isbn=978-8484782889|author2=Montse Aguer Teixidor  |author3=photography, Jordi Puig |author4= translation, Steve Cedar }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FGSD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salvador-dali.org/museus/figueres/en_historia.html|title=Figueres: Teatre Museu Dalí – History|year=2010|publisher=Fundació Gala-Salvador Dalí|accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalí continued to indulge in [[publicity stunt]]s and self-consciously outrageous behavior. To promote his 1962 book ''The World of Salvador Dalí'', he appeared in a Manhattan bookstore on a bed, wired up to a machine that traced his [[Electroencephalography|brain waves]] and [[blood pressure]]. He would autograph books while thus monitored, and the book buyer would also be given the paper chart recording.&lt;ref name="Meisler" /&gt;

In 1968, Dalí filmed a humorous television advertisement for {{illm|Lanvin (chocolate)|lt=Lanvin|fr|Lanvin (chocolat)}} chocolates.&lt;ref name="Augustin"&gt;[http://ehotelier.com/browse/news_item.php?id=P12135 Salvador Dalí at Le Meurice Paris and St Regis in New York] Andreas Augustin, ehotelier.com, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In this, he proclaims in French "Je suis fou du chocolat Lanvin!" ("I'm crazy about Lanvin chocolate!") while biting a morsel, causing him to become [[strabismus|cross-eyed]] and his moustache to swivel upwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|O0Zc1heZlwc|Salvador Dali – Chocolat Lanvin $}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1968, his status as an extravagant artist was put to use in a publicity campaign ("If you got it, flaunt it!") for [[Braniff International Airlines]].&lt;ref name="Namath"&gt;''Namath: A Biography'', [[Mark Kriegel]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=YNosf2VbwVsC&amp;lpg=PA290-IA16&amp;ots=_CLapgFfFm&amp;pg=PA290-IA16#v=onepage p. 290]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, he designed the [[Chupa Chups]] logo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=H.

In the television programme ''Dirty Dalí: A Private View'' broadcast on [[Channel 4]] on 3 June 2007, art critic [[Brian Sewell]] described his acquaintance with Dalí in the late 1960s, which included lying down in the fetal position without trousers in the armpit of a figure of Christ and masturbating for Dalí, who pretended to take photos while fumbling in his own trousers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007 |title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dalí |work=The Scotsman |location=UK  |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html |title=The Dali I knew |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do |archive-date=July 7, 2007 |first=Brian |last=Sewell |journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]] |date=January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Final years and death ===

In 1968, Dalí had bought a [[Castle of Púbol|castle in Púbol]] for Gala; and starting in 1971 she would retreat there alone for weeks at a time. By Dalí's own admission, he had agreed not to go there without written permission from his wife.&lt;ref name="GalaGSDF" /&gt; His fears of abandonment and estrangement from his longtime artistic muse contributed to depression and failing health.&lt;ref name="Meisler" /&gt;

In 1980 at age 76, Dalí's health took a catastrophic turn. His right hand trembled terribly, with [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson-like]] symptoms. His near-[[senile]] wife allegedly had been dosing him with a dangerous cocktail of unprescribed medicine that damaged his nervous system, thus causing an untimely end to his artistic capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Ian (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos]] bestowed on Dalí the title of ''Marqués de Dalí de Púbol''&lt;ref name="Marquess title"&gt;[http://www.heraldaria.com/phorum/read.php?f=1&amp;i=25695&amp;t=25695 Excerpts from the BOE] – Website Heráldica y Genealogía Hispana&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boe.es/aeboe/consultas/bases_datos/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1989-4234 Dalí as "Marqués de Dalí de Púbol"] – Boletín Oficial del Estado, the official gazette of the Spanish government&lt;/ref&gt; (''Marquis of Dalí de Púbol'') in the [[Spanish nobility|nobility of Spain]], hereby referring to [[Púbol]], the place where he lived. The title was in first instance hereditary, but on request of Dalí changed to life only in 1983.&lt;ref name="Marquess title" /&gt;

Gala died on 10 June 1982, at the age of 87. After Gala's death, Dalí lost much of his will to live. He deliberately [[dehydration|dehydrated]] himself, possibly as a suicide attempt; there are also claims that he had tried to put himself into a state of [[suspended animation]] as he had read that some [[microorganism]]s could do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/dali-6-12.html|title=Salvador Dali – Paths to Immortality|last=|first=|date=|website=History of Art|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved from Figueres to [[Castle of Púbol|the castle in Púbol]], which was the site of her death and her grave.&lt;ref name="Meisler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GalaGSDF" /&gt;

In May 1983, Dalí revealed what would be his last painting, ''[[The Swallow's Tail]]'', a work heavily influenced by the mathematical [[catastrophe theory]] of [[René Thom]].

In 1984, a fire broke out in his bedroom&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E1DB1038F932A3575AC0A962948260 "Dalí Resting at Castle After Injury in Fire"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. September 1, 1984. Retrieved July 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; under unclear circumstances. It was possibly a suicide attempt by Dalí, or possibly simple negligence by his staff. Dalí was rescued by friend and collaborator [[Robert Descharnes]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/2014/02/18/03004-20140218ARTFIG00206-deces-de-robert-descharnes-l-homme-qui-avait-sauve-salvador-dal.php Décès de Robert Descharnes, l'homme qui avait sauvé Salvador Dalí] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to Figueres, where a group of his friends, patrons, and fellow artists saw to it that he was comfortable living in his [[Dalí Theatre and Museum|Theater-Museum]] in his final years.

There have been allegations that Dalí was forced by his guardians to sign blank canvases that would later, even after his death, be used in forgeries and sold as originals.&lt;ref name="scandal"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Dalí Scandal: An Investigation | author=Mark Rogerson | isbn=978-0575037861 | publisher=Victor Gollancz | year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also alleged that he knowingly sold otherwise-blank lithograph paper which he had signed, possibly producing over 50,000 such sheets from 1965 until his death.&lt;ref name="Meisler" /&gt; As a result, art dealers tend to be wary of late graphic works attributed to Dalí.&lt;ref name="Forde_170"/&gt;

In November 1988, Dalí entered the hospital with [[heart failure]]; a [[pacemaker]] had been implanted previously. On 5 December 1988, he was visited by King Juan Carlos, who confessed that he had always been a serious devotee of Dalí.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meredith Etherington-Smith|Etherington-Smith, Meredith]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=soncxLrkYX0C&amp;dq The Persistence of Memory: A Biography of Dalí] p. 411, 1995 Da Capo Press, {{ISBN|0306806622}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalí gave the king a drawing, ''Head of Europa'', which would turn out to be Dalí's final drawing.

In early January 1989, Dali was returned to the Teatro-Museo and on his return he made his last public appearance. He was taken in a wheelchair to a room where press and TV were waiting and made a brief statement, saying:
{{quote|When you are a genius, you do not have the right to die, because we are necessary for the progress of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://somatemps.me/2017/03/26/video-ultima-entrevista-a-dali-viva-el-rey-viva-espana-viva-cataluna/ Somatemps Catalanitat és Hispanitat, ''Última entrevista a Dalí: “¡Viva el Rey, viva España, viva Cataluña!”'' (video), published 26 March 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://elpais.com/diario/1986/07/17/cultura/521935202_850215.html El País, ''Dalí vuelve a casa'', 17 July 1986]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the morning of 23 January 1989, while his favorite record of ''[[Tristan und Isolde|Tristan and Isolde]]'' played, Dalí died of heart failure at the age of 84. He is buried in the [[crypt]] below the stage of his [[Dalí Theatre and Museum|Theatre and Museum]] in Figueres.

== Symbolism ==
Dalí employed extensive symbolism in his work. For instance, the hallmark "melting watches" that first appear in ''The Persistence of Memory'' suggest [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory that [[Special Relativity|time is relative]] and not fixed.&lt;ref name=Conquete /&gt; The idea for clocks functioning symbolically in this way came to Dalí when he was staring at a runny piece of [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert cheese]] on a hot August day.&lt;ref&gt;Salvador Dalí, ''The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí'' (New York: Dial Press, 1942), p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[elephant]] is also a recurring image in Dalí's works. It appeared in his 1944 work ''[[Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening]]''. The elephants, inspired by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]'s sculpture [[Obelisks in Rome#6|base]] in Rome of an [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva#Minerva's Pulcino|elephant carrying an ancient obelisk]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Taylor in [[Dawn Adès]] (ed.), ''Dalí'' (Milan: Bompiani, 2004), p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; are portrayed "with long, multijointed, almost invisible legs of desire"&lt;ref name=countycollection&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countyhallgallery.com/education/dali_collection.htm |title=Dalí Universe Collection |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201225951/http://www.countyhallgallery.com/education/dali_collection.htm |archive-date=1 December 2008 |work=County Hall Gallery |access-date=July 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with obelisks on their backs. Coupled with the image of their brittle legs, these encumbrances, noted for their phallic overtones, create a sense of phantom reality. "The elephant is a distortion in space", one analysis explains, "its spindly legs contrasting the idea of weightlessness with structure."&lt;ref name=countycollection /&gt; "I am painting pictures which make me die for joy, I am creating with an absolute naturalness, without the slightest aesthetic concern, I am making things that inspire me with a profound emotion and I am trying to paint them honestly."&amp;nbsp;– Salvador Dalí, in Dawn Ades, ''Dalí and Surrealism''.

The egg is another common Dalíesque image. He connects the egg to the prenatal and intrauterine, thus using it to symbolize hope and love;&lt;ref name=symb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countyhallgallery.com/education/dali_symbols.htm |title=Salvador Dalí's symbolism |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202083808/http://www.countyhallgallery.com/education/dali_symbols.htm |archive-date=2 December 2006 |work=County Hall Gallery |access-date=July 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; it appears in ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' and ''[[Metamorphosis of Narcissus|The Metamorphosis of Narcissus]]''. ''The Metamorphosis of Narcissus'' also symbolized death and [[petrification]]. There are also giant sculptures of eggs in various locations at Dalí's house in Port Lligat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stone|first1=Peter|title=Frommer's Barcelona|publisher=Wiley Publishing Inc.|isbn=978-0470096925|page=284|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=v8ehi--t7EYC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq=portlligat+house+dali+eggs#v=onepage&amp;q=portlligat%20house%20dali%20eggs&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 March 2017|date=2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as at the [[Dalí Theatre and Museum]] in Figueres.

Various other animals appear throughout his work as well: [[ant]]s point to death, decay, and immense sexual desire; the [[snail]] is connected to the human head (he saw a snail on a bicycle outside Freud's house when he first met [[Sigmund Freud]]); and [[locust]]s are a symbol of waste and fear.&lt;ref name=symb /&gt;

Both Dalí and his father enjoyed eating [[sea urchin]]s, freshly caught in the sea near Cadaqués. The [[radial symmetry]] of the sea urchin fascinated Dalí, and he adapted its form to many art works. Other foods also appear throughout his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/dali/salvador/food.html|title=Salvador Dali: Liquid Desire|work=ngv.vic.gov.au|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science ===
References to Dalí in the context of science are made in terms of his fascination with the paradigm shift that accompanied the birth of [[quantum mechanics]] in the twentieth century. Inspired by [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[uncertainty principle]], in 1958 he wrote in his "Anti-Matter Manifesto": "In the Surrealist period, I wanted to create the iconography of the interior world and the world of the marvelous, of my father [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]. Today, the exterior world and that of physics has transcended the one of psychology. My father today is Dr. Heisenberg."&lt;ref name=triangle&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetriangle.org/media/storage/paper689/news/2005/04/29/Entertainment/Dali-Explorations.Into.The.Domain.Of.Science-944328.shtml?norewrite200608080502 |title=Dalí: Explorations into the domain of science |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208181828/http://media.www.thetriangle.org/media/storage/paper689/news/2005/04/29/Entertainment/Dali-Explorations.Into.The.Domain.Of.Science-944328.shtml |archive-date=8 December 2010 |work=The Triangle Online |access-date=August 8, 2006 |last=Datta |first=Suman |page=1 |publisher=[[College Publisher]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this respect, ''[[The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory]]'', which appeared in 1954, in harking back to ''The Persistence of Memory'' and in portraying that painting in fragmentation and disintegration, summarizes Dalí's acknowledgment of the new science.&lt;ref name=triangle /&gt;

== Endeavors outside painting ==
Dalí was a versatile artist. Some of his more popular works are sculptures and other objects, and he is also noted for his contributions to theatre, fashion, and photography, among other areas.

=== Sculptures and other objects ===
[[File:Hommage à Newton.jpg|thumb|upright|''Homage to Newton'' (1985), Bronze with dark patina. [[UOB Plaza]], [[Singapore]].

Two of the most popular objects of the surrealist movement were ''[[Lobster Telephone]]'' and ''[[Mae West Lips Sofa]]'', completed by Dalí in 1936 and 1937, respectively. Surrealist artist and patron [[Edward James]] commissioned both of these pieces from Dalí; James inherited a large English estate in [[West Dean, West Sussex|West Dean]], West Sussex when he was five and was one of the foremost supporters of the surrealists in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=natgalaust&gt;[http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=2607 Lobster telephone]. ''National Gallery of Australia''. Retrieved on August 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; "Lobsters and telephones had strong sexual connotations for [Dalí]", according to the display caption for the ''Lobster Telephone'' at the [[Tate Gallery]], "and he drew a close analogy between food and sex."&lt;ref name=tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=2988 Tate Collection | Lobster Telephone by Salvador Dalí]. ''Tate Online''. Retrieved on August 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The telephone was functional, and James purchased four of them from Dalí to replace the phones in his retreat home. One now appears at the Tate Gallery; the second can be found at the German Telephone Museum in [[Frankfurt]]; the third belongs to the Edward James Foundation; and the fourth is at the [[National Gallery of Australia]].&lt;ref name=natgalaust /&gt;

The wood and satin ''Mae West Lips Sofa'' was shaped after the lips of actress [[Mae West]], whom Dalí apparently found fascinating.&lt;ref name=unbound /&gt; West was previously the subject of Dalí's 1935 painting ''The Face of Mae West''. The ''Mae West Lips Sofa'' currently resides at the Brighton and Hove Museum in England.

Between 1941 and 1970, Dalí created an ensemble of 39 pieces of jewelry; many pieces are intricate, and some contain moving parts. The most famous assemblage, ''The Royal Heart'', is made of gold and is encrusted with 46 rubies, 42 diamonds, and four emeralds, created in such a way that the center "beats" much like a real heart. Dalí himself commented that "Without an audience, without the presence of spectators, these jewels would not fulfill the function for which they came into being. The viewer, then, is the ultimate artist."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Cheatham Foundation. ''Dali, a study of his art-in-jewels: the collection of the Owen Cheatham Foundation''. New York: New York Graphic Society. 1959. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Dalí – Joies" ("The Jewels of Dalí") collection is in the Dalí Theater Museum in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain.

Dalí took a stab at [[industrial design]] in the 1970s with a 500-piece run of the upscale ''Suomi'' tableware by [[Timo Sarpaneva]] that Dalí decorated for the German Rosenthal [[porcelain]] maker's "Studio Linie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Faenza-Goldmedaille für SUOMI | journal=Artis | year = 1976 | volume = 29 | page = 8| issn = 0004-3842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dali Sundial in Paris.jpg|thumb|A sundial painted by Dali, 27 [[Rue Saint-Jacques, Paris]]]]

=== Theatre and film ===
In theatre, Dalí constructed the scenery for [[Federico García Lorca]]'s 1927 romantic play ''[[Mariana Pineda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fglorca.htm |title=Federico García Lorca |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210175324/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fglorca.htm |archivedate=10 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''[[Bacchanale]]'' (1939), a ballet based on and set to the music of [[Richard Wagner]]'s 1845 opera ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'', Dalí provided both the set design and the [[libretto]].&lt;ref name=designws&gt;[http://www.designws.com/pagina/1dalieng.htm Dalí Rotterdam Museum Boijmans]. ''Paris Contemporary Designs''. Retrieved on August 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bacchanale'' was followed by set designs for ''Labyrinth'' in 1941 and ''[[The Three-Cornered Hat]]'' in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marquette.edu/haggerty/exhibitions/past/dalihat.html |title=Past Exhibitions |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903014732/http://www.marquette.edu/haggerty/exhibitions/past/dalihat.html |archive-date=3 September 2006 |work=[[Haggerty Museum of Art]] |access-date=August 8, 2006 |publisher=[[Marquette University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalí became intensely interested in film when he was young, going to the theatre most Sundays. He was part of the era where silent films were being viewed and drawing on the medium of film became popular. He believed there were two dimensions to the theories of film and cinema: "things themselves", the facts that are presented in the world of the camera; and "photographic imagination", the way the camera shows the picture and how creative or imaginative it looks.&lt;ref&gt;"Dali &amp; Film"  Edt. Gale, Matthew. Salvador Dalí Museum Inc. St Petersburg, Florida. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Dalí was active in front of and behind the scenes in the film world.

He is credited as co-creator of [[Luis Buñuel]]'s surrealist film ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'', a 17-minute French art film co-written with Luis Buñuel that is widely remembered for its graphic opening scene simulating the slashing of a human eyeball with a razor. In ''Un Chien Andalou'', surreal imagery and irrational discontinuities in time and space produce a dreamlike quality.&lt;ref&gt;Eberwein, Robert T. (2014). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EbD_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq= Film and the Dream Screen: A Sleep and a Forgetting]''. Princeton University Press. p. 83. {{ISBN|1400853893}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The second film he produced with Buñuel was entitled ''[[L'Age d'Or]]'', and it was performed at Studio 28 in Paris in 1930. ''L'Age d'Or'' was "banned for years after fascist and anti-Semitic groups staged a stink bomb and ink-throwing riot in the Paris theater where it was shown".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2000novdec/bunuel.html "L'Âge d'Or (The Golden Age)"] Harvard Film Archive. 2006. April 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of these films, ''Un Chien Andalou'' and ''L'Age d'Or'', have had a tremendous impact on the independent surrealist film movement. "If ''Un Chien Andalou'' stands as the supreme record of Surrealism's adventures into the realm of the unconscious, then ''L'Âge d'Or'' is perhaps the most trenchant and implacable expression of its revolutionary intent".&lt;ref&gt;Short, Robert. "The Age of Gold: Surrealist Cinema, Persistence of Vision" Vol. 3, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalí worked with other famous filmmakers, such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. The most well-known of his film projects is probably the [[dream sequence]] in Hitchcock's ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'', which delves into themes of [[psychoanalysis]]. Hitchcock needed a dreamlike quality to his film, which dealt with the idea that a repressed experience can directly trigger a [[neurosis]], and he knew that Dalí's work would help create the atmosphere he wanted in his film.

Dalí also worked with [[Walt Disney]] on the short film production ''[[Destino]]''. Completed in 2003 by Baker Bloodworth and Walt's nephew [[Roy E. Disney]], it contains dreamlike images of strange figures flying and walking about. It is based on Mexican songwriter Armando Dominguez' song "Destino". When Disney hired Dalí to help produce the film in 1946, they were not prepared for the quantity of work that lay ahead. For eight months, they worked on it continuously, until their efforts had to stop when they realized they were in financial trouble. However, it was eventually finished 48 years later, and shown in various film festivals. The film consists of Dalí's artwork interacting with Disney's character animation.

In 1960 Dalí and the photographer [[Philippe Halsman]] made a documentary video called ''Chaos and Creation'', that showed him creating a painting.&lt;ref&gt;Short, Robert, Stephen Barber, and Candice Black (2008). ''The Age of Gold: Surrealist Cinema''. Los Angeles, Calif: Solar. p. 174. {{ISBN|978-0979984709}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalí completed only one other film in his lifetime, ''Impressions of Upper Mongolia'' (1975), in which he narrated a story about an expedition in search of giant [[Psilocybin mushroom|hallucinogenic mushrooms]]. The imagery was based on microscopic [[uric acid]] stains on the brass band of a ballpoint pen on which Dalí had been urinating for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott H. King, [http://www.kamera.co.uk/article.php/895 ''Dalí, Surrealism and Cinema''], Kamera Books 2007, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1970s, film director [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] cast Dali in the role of the Padishah Emperor in a production of ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', based on the novel by [[Frank Herbert]]. According to the 2013 documentary on the film, ''[[Jodorowsky's Dune]]'', Jodorowsky met Dali in the King Cole Bar in the St. Regis hotel in Manhattan to discuss the role. Dali expressed interest in the film but required as a condition of appearing that he be made the highest-paid actor in Hollywood. Jodorowsky accordingly cast Dali as the emperor, but he planned to cut Dali's screen time to mere minutes, promising he be the highest-paid actor on a per minute basis. The film was ultimately never made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jodorowskysdune.com/synopsis.html|title=Jodorowsky's Dune – Official Website of the Documentary – Synopsis|work=jodorowskysdune.com|accessdate=February 14, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217071152/http://jodorowskysdune.com/synopsis.html|archivedate=17 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1927, Dali began to write the libretto for an opera, which he called ''[[Être Dieu]]'' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20140802151038/http://www.salvadorbrand.com/Salvador-Brand/opera.html ''To Be God'']). He wrote this together with Federico Garcia Lorca one afternoon in the Café Regina Victoria in Madrid. In 1974, for a recording in Paris, the opera was adapted by the Spanish writer Manuel Vazquez Montalban, who wrote the libretto, while the music was created by Igor Wakhevitch. During the recording, however, Dali refused to follow the text written by Montalban, and instead, began to improvise in the belief that “Salvador Dali never repeats himself.”

=== Fashion and photography ===
[[File:Salvador Dali A (Dali Atomicus) 09633u.jpg|thumb|''Dali Atomicus'', photo by [[Philippe Halsman]] (1948), shown before support wires were removed from the image]]
Dalí built a repertoire in the [[fashion]] and [[photography]] businesses as well. His cooperation with Italian fashion designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]] was well-known, when Dalí was commissioned to produce a white dress with a lobster print. Other designs Dalí made for her include a shoe-shaped hat, and a pink belt with lips for a buckle. He was also involved in creating textile designs and perfume bottles. In 1950, Dalí created a special "costume for the year 2045" with [[Christian Dior]].&lt;ref name=designws /&gt;

Photographers with whom he collaborated include [[Man Ray]], [[Brassaï]], [[Cecil Beaton]], and [[Philippe Halsman]]. With Man Ray and Brassaï, Dalí photographed nature; with the others, he explored a range of obscure topics, including (with Halsman) the ''Dalí Atomica'' series (1948)&amp;nbsp;–  inspired by his painting ''Leda Atomica''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;–  which in one photograph depicts "a painter's easel, three cats, a bucket of water, and Dalí himself floating in the air."&lt;ref name=designws /&gt;

One of Dalí's most unorthodox artistic creations may have been an entire [[persona]], in addition to his own. At a French [[nightclub]] in 1965, Dalí met [[Amanda Lear]], a [[fashion model]] then known as Peki D'Oslo.&lt;ref name=Prose&gt;Prose, Francine. (2000) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0rJ2EPVYbFUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Lives of the Muses: Nine Women and the Artists they Inspired]''. Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0060555254}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lear became his protégée and muse,&lt;ref name = Prose/&gt; later writing about their affair in her authorized biography ''My Life With Dalí'' (1986).&lt;ref name=Lear&gt;Lear, Amanda. (1986) ''My Life with Dalí''. Beaufort Books. {{ISBN|0825303737}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Transfixed by the mannish, larger-than-life Lear, Dalí masterminded her successful transition from modeling to the music world, advising her on self-presentation and helping spin mysterious stories about her origin as she took the [[disco]]-art scene by storm. According to Lear, she and Dalí were united in a "spiritual marriage" on a deserted mountaintop.&lt;ref name=Prose /&gt; She was referred to as Dalí's "Frankenstein",&lt;ref name=Lozano&gt;Lozano, Carlos. (2000) ''Sex, Surrealism, Dalí, and Me''. Razor Books Ltd. {{ISBN|0953820505}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some observers believed Lear's assumed name was a [[pun]] on the French phrase "L'Amant Dalí", or "Lover of Dalí". Lear took the place of an earlier muse, [[Ultra Violet (Isabelle Collin Dufresne)]], who had left Dalí's side to join [[The Factory]] of [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref name=Etherington-Smith&gt;[[Meredith Etherington-Smith|Etherington-Smith, Meredith]].

Both former apprentices would go on to successfully promote their own careers in the arts. On April 10, 2005, they joined a panel discussion "Reminiscences of Dalí: A Conversation with Friends of the Artist" as part of a symposium "The Dalí Renaissance" for a major retrospective Dalí show at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=PMADali&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/micro_sites/exhibitions/dali/downloads/symposium.pdf |title=Symposium announcement |work=The Dalí Renaissance: An international symposium |publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art |accessdate=24 May 2012 |date=April 10–11, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114033703/http://www.philamuseum.org/micro_sites/exhibitions/dali/downloads/symposium.pdf |archivedate=14 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their conversation is recorded in the 236-page exhibition catalog ''The Dalí Renaissance: New Perspectives on His Life and Art after 1940''.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=edited by Michael R.|title=The Dalí renaissance : new perspectives on his life and art after 1940 : an international symposium|year=2008|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art, distributed by Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CN|isbn=978-0300136470|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/publications/377-1-31012.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Dali museum.jpg|thumb|[[Dalí Theatre and Museum]] in [[Figueres]] also holds the crypt where Dalí is buried]]
Architectural achievements include his [[Port Lligat]] house near [[Cadaqués]], as well as his [[Dalí Theatre and Museum|Theatre and Museum]] in [[Figueres]]. A major work outside of Spain was the temporary ''Dream of Venus'' surrealist pavilion at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], which contained within it a number of unusual sculptures and statues, including live performers posing as statues.&lt;ref name=DrmVns&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaffner|first=Ingrid, Photogr. by Eric Schaal|title=Salvador Dalí's "Dream of Venus": the surrealist funhouse from the 1939 World's Fair|year=2002|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1568983592|edition=1. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literary works ===
Under the encouragement of poet [[Federico García Lorca]], Dalí attempted an approach to a literary career through the means of the "pure novel". In his only novel ''Hidden Faces'' (1944), Dalí describes, in vividly visual terms, the intrigues and love affairs of a group of dazzling, eccentric aristocrats who, with their luxurious and extravagant lifestyle, symbolize the decadence of the 1930s. The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cléda pursue an awkward love affair, but property transactions, interwar political turmoil, the [[French Resistance]], his marriage to another woman and her responsibilities as a landowner and businesswoman drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot. The novel concludes at the end of the [[Second World War]], with Solange dying before Grandsailles can return to his former property and reunite with her.&lt;ref&gt;Salvador Dali: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].

His other, nonfictional literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1952–63), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1927–33).

=== Graphic arts ===
The artist worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dalí print market.&lt;ref name="Forde_170"&gt;Forde, Kevin (2011).

== Politics and personality ==

Dalí's politics played a significant role in his emergence as an artist. In his youth, he embraced both [[anarchism]] and [[communism]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=0300112955 Robin Adèle Greeley, ''Surrealism and the Spanish Civil War''], Yale University Press, 2006, pp. 62-63, {{ISBN|0300112955}}&lt;/ref&gt; though his writings tell anecdotes of making radical political statements more to shock listeners than from any deep conviction. This was in keeping with Dalí's allegiance to the [[Dada]] movement.&lt;ref name="Dali Dada" /&gt;&lt;ref name=navarro&gt;{{cite web |last=Navarro |first=Vicente |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/navarro12062003.html |title=The Jackboot of Dada: Salvador Dalí, Fascist |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060803054541/http://www.counterpunch.org/navarro12062003.html |archive-date=3 August 2006 |work=Counterpunch |date=December 6, 2003 |access-date=July 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As he grew older his political allegiances changed, especially as the Surrealist movement went through transformations under the leadership of the [[Trotsky]]ist writer [[André Breton]], who is said to have called Dalí in for questioning on his politics. In his 1970 book ''Dalí by Dalí'', Dalí declared himself to be both an anarchist and [[monarchist]].&lt;ref&gt;Salvador Dalí, ''Dalí by Dalí'', Harry N. Abrams, New York, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939), Dalí fled from the fighting and refused to align himself with any group. He did the same during World War II (1939–1945), for which he was heavily criticized; [[George Orwell]] accused him of "scuttling off like a rat as soon as France is in danger" after Dalí had prospered in France during the pre-war years. "When the European War approaches he has one preoccupation only: how to find a place which has good cookery and from which he can make a quick bolt if danger comes too near", Orwell observed.&lt;ref name=orwell&gt;Orwell, George [http://theorwellprize.co.uk/george-orwell/by-orwell/essays-and-other-works/benefit-of-clergy-some-notes-on-salvador-dali/ "Benefit of Clergy: Some Notes on Salvador Dalí"]. theorwellprize.co.uk. Retrieved February 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In a notable 1944 review of Dalí's autobiography, Orwell wrote, "One ought to be able to hold in one's head simultaneously the two facts that Dalí is a good draughtsman and a disgusting human being".&lt;ref name="orwell"/&gt;

After his return to Catalonia post World War II, Dalí moved closer to the [[authoritarian]] regime of [[Francisco Franco]]. Some of Dalí's statements were supportive, congratulating Franco for his actions aimed "at clearing Spain of destructive forces".&lt;ref name=navarro /&gt; Dalí, having returned to the Catholic faith and becoming increasingly religious as time went on, may have been referring to the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] [[Spanish Civil War#Atrocities|atrocities during the Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne26.htm |title=Payne, Stanley G., ''A History of Spain and Portugal'', Vol. 2, Ch. 26, pp. 648–51 (Print Edition: University of Wisconsin Press, 1973) (Library of Iberian Resources Online, Accessed May 15, 2007) |publisher=Libro.uca.edu |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De la Cueva, Julio, "Religious Persecution, Anticlerical Tradition and Revolution: On Atrocities against the Clergy during the Spanish Civil War", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol XXXIII – 3, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Dalí sent telegrams to Franco, praising him for signing [[death warrant]]s for prisoners.&lt;ref name=navarro /&gt; He even met Franco personally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewcusack.com/2005/07/25/fun-with-franco/|title=Fun with Franco!|work=andrewcusack.com|accessdate=February 14, 2015|date=2005-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and painted a portrait of Franco's granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.granger.com/results.asp?image=0142040&amp;itemw=4&amp;itemf=0001&amp;itemstep=1&amp;itemx=19&amp;screenwidth=1364|title=Franco and Dalí|last=|first=|date=|website=Granger|access-date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also once sent a telegram praising the ''Conducător'', [[Romania]]n [[Communist]] leader [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], for his adoption of a [[scepter]] as part of his regalia. The Romanian daily newspaper ''[[Scînteia]]'' published it, without suspecting its mocking aspect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=EVDqAAAAMAAJ Michael Taylor, ''The Dalí Renaissance: New Perspectives on His Life and Art After 1940''], Philadelphia Museum of Art, 2008, {{ISBN|0300136471}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Dalí's few possible bits of open disobedience was his continued praise of [[Federico García Lorca]] even in the years when Lorca's works were banned.&lt;ref name="conversations"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}

Dalí, a colorful and imposing presence with his ever–present long cape, walking stick, haughty expression, and upturned waxed moustache, was famous for having said that "every morning upon awakening, I experience a supreme pleasure: that of being Salvador Dalí".&lt;ref name=smithsonian&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2005/april/dali.php?page=3 The Surreal World of Salvador Dalí].

Dali's religious views were a matter of interest. In interviews Dali revealed his mysticism. In his later years, while still remaining a Roman Catholic, Dalí also claimed to be an agnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Salvador Dalí, 1904-1989|year=1994|publisher=Benedikt Taschen|isbn=978-3822802984|author=Robert Descharnes, Gilles Néret|page=166|quote=Dali, dualist as ever in his approach, was now claiming to be both an agnostic and a Roman Catholic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1942 autobiography ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dali]]'', he sums up his life story with an impassioned defense of the Catholic Church and religion in general.

Besides visual puns, Dalí shared in the surrealist delight in verbal puns, obscure allusions, and word games. He often spoke in a bizarre combination of French, Spanish, Catalan, and English which was sometimes amusing as well as arcane.

When interviewed by [[Mike Wallace]] on his ''[[60 Minutes]]'' television show, Dalí kept referring to himself in the [[illeism|third person]], as the "Divino Dalí" (Divine Dalí), and told the startled Wallace matter-of-factly that he did not believe in his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Dali appeared in public on a number of occasions with an [[anteater]], notably on a lead in Paris in 1969 and on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' on March 6, 1970 when he carried a small anteater on-stage. On the show, he surprised fellow guest [[Lillian Gish]] by flinging the anteater onto her lap.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CmM19jBdrI&amp;feature=youtu.be Salvador Dali on the Dick Cavett Show, Youtube&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In Carlos Lozano's biography, ''Sex, Surrealism, Dalí, and Me'', produced with the collaboration of [[Clifford Thurlow]], Lozano makes it clear that Dalí never stopped being a surrealist. As Dalí said of himself: "the only difference between me and the surrealists is that I am a surrealist".&lt;ref name=artcyclopedia /&gt;

Salvador Dalí has been cited as a major inspiration by many modern artists, such as [[Damien Hirst]], [[Jeff Koons]], and most other modern surrealists. Salvador Dalí's manic expression and famous moustache have made him something of a [[cultural icon]] for the bizarre and surreal. He has been portrayed on film by [[Robert Pattinson]] in ''[[Little Ashes]]'' (2008), and by [[Adrien Brody]] in ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'' (2011). He was also parodied in a series of painting skits on ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' as "Salvador Silly" (played by Cosmo Allegretti) and in a ''[[Sesame Street]]'' muppet skit as "Salvador Dada" (an orange gold Anything Muppet performed by [[Jim Henson]]).

The [[Salvador Dalí Desert]] in [[Bolivia]] and the [[Dali (crater)|Dali crater]] on the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] are named for him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5444">'''Saskia Weishut-Snapper''' (born 5 August 1938 in [[Amsterdam]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[fiber artist]]. 

== Early life and family==
Saskia grew up in [[Bergen, North Holland]], a town with an art colony in which both her parents were active. Her mother was {{ill|Mies Bloch|nl}}, a painter and illustrator, mostly known for her [[cross-stitch]] designs. Her father was {{ill|Rein Snapper|nl||WD=}}, a painter, illustrator, and wood printer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bottercourant.nl/nieuws/algemeen/5393-peintisseries-van-saskia-weishut-snapper|title=Peintisseries van Saskia Weishut-Snapper|date=2015-07-15|work=Bottercourant|access-date=2018-08-07|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saskia is married, has five sons, and lives in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
Weishut-Snapper turned to textile arts in 1970. Creating mixed media scenes somewhere between painting and quilting, she  refers to her works as 'peintisseries'. The subjects of her art are often textile landscapes, fantasy buildings, abstract compositions and themes based on Jewish tradition. She mostly exhibits in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rheden.nieuws.nl/nieuws/100557/opening-expositie-peintisseries-saskia-weishut-snapper/|title=Opening expositie Peintisseries van Saskia Weishut-Snapper|date=2017-05-28|work=Rheden|access-date=2018-08-07|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crescas.nl/nieuws/2013-03-22/wlooz/Peintisseries-van-Saskia-Weishut-Snapper/|title=Crescas nieuws: 'Peintisseries' van Saskia Weishut-Snapper - Crescas|website=www.crescas.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wevershuis.nl/tag/saskia-weishut-snapper/|title=Saskia Weishut-Snapper {{!}} Museum Het Leids Wevershuis|website=www.wevershuis.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vezel.org/agenda/tentoonstelling-kunst-met-nesjomme-peintisseries-van-saskia-weishut-snapper/|title=Van Textiel tot Tyvek, werk van Saskia Weishut-Snapper - Vezel|website=www.vezel.org|language=nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pkcastricum.nl/foto-album/kunstwerken-saskia-weishut-snapper-pk-castricum/item1390|title=Kunstwerken Saskia Weishut - Snapper {{!}} PK Castricum|last=Castricum|first=Protestantse Kerk|website=www.pkcastricum.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.destentor.nl/deventer/wandkleden-van-saskia-weishut-in-magna-domus~aa180751/|title=Wandkleden van Saskia Weishut in Magna Domus {{!}} destentor.nl|last=|first=|date=|website=www.destentor.nl|language=nl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.galeries.nl/expo.asp?exponr=11241|title=Saskia Weishut-Snapper: Tyvek Sandwiches - Museum Jan van der Togt : Expositie / Exhibition at GALERIES.NL|website=www.galeries.nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also showed her paintings in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Japan, Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.viralagenda.com/pt/events/418928/exposicao-saskia-weishut-snapper|title=Exposição - Saskia Weishut Snapper - Viral Agenda|website=www.viralagenda.com|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityguideny.com/article/Gallery-Shows-in-New-York-City-This-Week-Jun-4-Jun-11#.W2lPT4kzbIU|title=Gallery Shows in New York City This Week - Jun 4-Jun 11|website=www.cityguideny.com|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityguideny.com/event/Agora-Gallery-2017-12-07-2017-12-07|title=Tripping the Light Fantastic - Agora Gallery 12/07/17  through 01/18/18|website=www.cityguideny.com|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scottish art in the nineteenth century''' is the body of [[visual art]] made in Scotland, by Scots, or about scottish subjects. This period saw the increasing professionalisation and organisation of art in Scotland. Major institutions founded in this period included the Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland, the [[Royal Scottish Academy|Royal Scottish Academy of Art]], the [[National Gallery of Scotland]], the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] and the [[Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts|Glasgow Institute]]. Art education in Edinburgh focused on the [[Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh]]. [[Glasgow School of Art]] was founded in 1845 and [[Grays School of Art]] in Aberdeen in 1885.

[[Henry Raeburn]], most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. His pupils included the brothers William, Archibald and Andrew Robertson. The next generation of portrait painters included David Watson and [[John Watson Gordon]]. Significant Glasgow artists included [[John Graham-Gilbert]] and [[Daniel Macnee]]. [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] emerged as of one of the most influential British artists of the century in a variety of forms. [[Alexander Nasmyth]] helped formulate the tradition of Scottish landscape painting, which focused in the mid-nineteenth century on the Highlands. It was taken into the late nineteenth century by artists including [[Horatio McCulloch]], [[Joseph Farquharson]] and [[William McTaggart]]. Towards the end of the century a number of artist colonies were founded, particularly in coastal communities such as [[Pittenweem]] and [[Kirkudbright]]. Wilkie was instrumental in the development of [[genre painting]], which was pursued by artists including [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]], [[Alexander George Fraser]] and [[Walter Geikie]]. He also helped inspire the interest in Spanish and oriental painting, continued by [[William Allan (painter)|William Allan]], [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] and [[John Phillip]].

Sculpture was pioneered in Scotland by [[Lawrence Macdonald]] and [[George Combe]]. [[John Steell]] was the first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland, gaining attention for his ''Alexander and Bucephasus'' and his design for a statue of Sir Walter Scott incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was boosted by the statues made for the [[Wallace Monument]] and by the centenary of [[Robert Burns]]' death in 1896. Photography was pioneered in Scotland by [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] and [[David Octavius Hill]]. As [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] they formed the first photographic studio in Scotland in 1843 and produced work that is among the first and finest artistic uses of photography. It was subsequently pursued by [[Thomas Annan]], [[George Washington Wilson]] and [[Clementina Hawarden]].

The beginnings of the [[Arts and Crafts]] movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered in Edinburgh by [[James Ballantine]] and in Glasgow by [[Daniel Cottier]]. The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] was one of the first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement. A [[Celtic Revival]], drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom, was pursued by artists including [[Anna Traquair]], [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]], Stewart Carmichael and George Dutch Davidson. In the late nineteenth century developments in Scottish art are associated with the Glasgow School. This was made up of loose groups including the [[Glasgow Boys]], of [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]], [[Joseph Crawhall]], [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]] and [[Edward Arthur Walton|E. A. Walton]], who were influenced by [[French Impressionism]] and [[Realism (art)|Realism]]. From around 1890 "The Four" or the "Spook School", was composed of acclaimed architect [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]], [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]] and [[Herbert MacNair]]. They produced a distinctive blend of influences that helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style.

==Institutions and education==
[[File:Wfm rsa building.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Scottish Academy]], Edinburgh]]
The Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland was founded in 1819 in Edinburgh, to provide an opportunity for artists to present their work. It came to be dominated by a small aristocratic elite and excluded artists from its committee. This led to the founding of the [[Royal Scottish Academy|Royal Scottish Academy of Art]] in 1826. The resulting competition between the two bodies eventually resulted in a de facto merger. In 1835 the now Royal Institution's building on Princess Street, Edinburgh became the Academy's home for exhibitions.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p90&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-500-20333-4}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy was granted a Royal Charter in 1837&lt;ref&gt;''Whitaker's Concise Almanack 2012'' (A&amp;amp;C Black, 2011), {{ISBN|1-4081-4230-9}}, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Rose, M. Macaroon, V. Crow, ''Frommer's Scotland'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 12th edn., 2012), {{ISBN|1-119-99276-1}}, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and its members were instrumental in the foundation of the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] in Edinburgh, which opened in 1859.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p90/&gt; The [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] was founded in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;D. Porter, and D. Prince, ''Frommer's Scotland'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 10th edn., 2008), {{ISBN|0-470-24912-9}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;109–111.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts|Glasgow Institute]] was formed in 1861 to provide exhibiting opportunities in the growing city similar to those in Edinburgh. It opened its own gallery on [[Sauchiehall Street]] in 1879. It received a Royal charter in 1896 and became the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hartley, ''Scottish Art Since 1900'' (National Galleries of Scotland, 1989), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scotland has had schools of art since the eighteenth century. The [[Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh]] had been founded in Edinburgh in 1760. It became the Trustees' School of Art, and placed under auspices of the Science and Art Department in South Kensington in 1858. It was taken over by the Scottish Education Department in 1907.&lt;ref name=Potter2013pp27&gt;M. Potter, ''The Concept of the 'Master'in Art Education in Britain and Ireland 1770 to the Present'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2013), {{ISBN|1409435555}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glasgow School of Art]] grew from the city's School of Design, founded in 1845. [[Grays School of Art]] in Aberdeen was founded in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;D. Arnold and D. P. Corbett, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QEsrlW8kH68C&amp;pg=PT296&amp;dq=scotland+schools+of+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gqdiUaO6IKbP0QWSqIDABg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwADgy ''A Companion to British Art: 1600 to the Present''] (Oxford: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013), {{ISBN|1-118-31377-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Principle Lee.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John Lee (1779–1859) by [[John Watson Gordon]]]]
[[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823) was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. Born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786, he is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers, doctors, professors, writers and ministers,&lt;ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3/&gt; adding elements of Romanticism to the [[Grand Manner]] tradition of [[Joshua Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Ochterbeck, ed., ''Michelin Green Guide: Great Britain Edition'' (London: Michelin, 5th edn., 2007), {{ISBN|1-906261-08-3}}, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a knight in 1822 and the King's [[painter and limner]] in 1823, marking a return to the post being associated with the production of art.&lt;ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3&gt;D. Campbell, ''Edinburgh: A Cultural and Literary History'' (Oxford: Signal Books, 2003), {{ISBN|1-902669-73-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;142–3.&lt;/ref&gt; His pupils included the brothers [[Alexander Robertson (artist)|William (Alexander)]] (1772–1841), [[Archibald Robertson (painter)|Archibald]] (1765–1835) and Andrew Robertson (1777–1845). William and Archibald went on to found the [[Columbian Academy of Painting]] in New York, and Andrew to be the leading Scottish [[Portrait miniature|miniaturist]] of his day. Also associated with Radeburn towards the end of his career were [[John Syme]] (1795–1861) and [[Colvin Smith]] (1795–1875).&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460–1990'' (Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|1-85158-251-7}}, pp. 151 and 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the generation of painters that followed Raeburn, David Watson (1767–1837) trained with Reynolds in London before returning home to become the first president of the Scottish Academy in 1826.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp75-6&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;75–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of both Reynolds and Raeburn can be seen in his work, including ''A Girl Drawing'' (1813) and the large group portrait ''The Children of the Earl of Elgin with their Nurse'' (c. 1805).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed as president of the academy by his nephew [[John Watson Gordon]] (1788–1864), who also studied with Raeburn. He painted portraits of leading cultural figures [[James Hogg]] and [[Carolina Nairne|Lady Nairne]] as part of a series of portraits commissioned by [[William Blackwood]]. From the 1840s his work began to be influenced by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, as can be seen in his full-length portrait of ''Principal Lee'' (1847).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Graham-Gilbert (1794–1866) was born in Glasgow and worked in the city from 1834, playing an important part in the professionalisation of painting there. Other figures to pursue their careers largely in portraiture and based in Glasgow included [[Daniel Macnee]] (1806–82). He moved to Edinburgh after his election of President of the Academy in 1876. Other major figures who worked in portraiture included [[Francis Grant (artist)|Francis Grant]], who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London, [[Robert Scott Lauder]] (1803–69), [[William Quiller Orchardson]] (1832–1910) and [[John Pettie]] (1839–93).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;163–4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Zephaniah Bell]] (1794–1883) was educated in London and was a forerunner of the trend of Parisian education that would become common among Scottish artists of the later nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp75-6/&gt; [[Andrew Geddes (artist)|Andrew Geddes]] (1783–1844) produced some landscapes, but also portraits before he finally moved to London in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Wornum and C. L. Eastlake, ''Descriptive and Historical Catalogue of the Pictures in the National Gallery ... British School ... Temporarily exhibited at South Kensington'' (London: National Gallery, 12th edn., 1864), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] (1785–1841) worked mainly in London, and produced the flattering painting of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] in Highland dress commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the kilt. He succeeded Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823 and would emerge of one of the most influential British artists of the century.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009pp678-9&gt;I.

==Landscape painting==
{{See also|Landscape painting in Scotland}}
[[File:Nasmyth Alexander Highland Loch.jpg|thumb|right|Highland Loch Landscape by [[Alexander Nasmyth]] (date unknown)]]
[[Alexander Nasmyth]] (1758–1840) visited Italy and worked in London, but returned to his native Edinburgh for most of his career. He produced work in a large range of forms, including his portrait of Romantic poet Robert Burns, which depicts him against a dramatic Scottish background, but he is chiefly remembered for his landscapes and is described in the ''Oxford Dictionary of Art'' as "the founder of the Scottish landscape tradition".&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p433&gt;Chilvers, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of John Knox (1778–1845) continued the theme of landscape, directly linking it with the Romantic works of [[Walter Scott]]&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Hill, ''Picturing Scotland Through the Waverley Novels: Walter Scott and the Origins of the Victorian Illustrated Novel'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), {{ISBN|0-7546-6806-1}}, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also among the first artists to take a major interest in depicting the urban landscape of Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kemp, ''The Pleasures and Treasures of Britain: A Discerning Traveller's Companion'' (Toronto: Dundurn, 1992), {{ISBN|1-55002-159-1}}, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of Highland landscape painting was continued by figures such as [[Horatio McCulloch]] (1806–67), [[Joseph Farquharson]] (1846–1935) and [[William McTaggart]] (1835–1910).&lt;ref name=Szasz200p136&gt;F. M. Szasz, ''Scots in the North American West, 1790–1917'' (Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2000), {{ISBN|0-8061-3253-1}}, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; McCulloch's images of places including [[Glen Coe]] and [[Loch Lomond]] and the [[Trossachs]], became parlour room panoramas that helped to define popular images of Scotland. This was helped by the Queen's declared affection for Scotland, signified by her adoption of [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] as a royal retreat. In this period a Scottish "grand tour" developed with large number of English artists, including [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]], flocking to the Highlands to paint and draw.&lt;ref name=Billcliffe2009p27&gt;R. Billcliffe, ''The Glasgow Boys'' (London: Frances Lincoln, 2009), {{ISBN|0-7112-2906-6}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1870s Farquharson was a major figure in interpreting Scottish landscapes, specialising in snowscapes and sheep, and using a mobile heated studio in order to capture the conditions from life.&lt;ref name=Szasz200p136/&gt; In the same period McTaggart emerged as the leading Scottish landscape painter, he has been compared with [[John Constable]] and described as the "Scottish Impressionist", with free brushwork often depicting stormy seas and moving clouds.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p376&gt;Chilvers, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion for coastal painting in the later nineteenth century led to the establishment of artist colonies in places such as [[Pittenweem]] and [[Crail]] in Fife,&lt;ref&gt;P. Howard, ''Landscapes: the Artists' Vision'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1991), {{ISBN|0-415-00775-5}}, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cockburnspath]] in the Borders, [[Cambuskenneth]] near Stirling on the River Forth&lt;ref&gt;N.

David Wilkie became the key figure in the development of British genre art. After a tour of Europe Wilkie he was increasingly influenced by [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque art|Baroque painting]]. He became most famous for his anecdotal paintings of Scottish and English life.&lt;ref name=Macdonald2000pp84-7&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;84–7.&lt;/ref&gt; His work on themes of Scottish everyday life included ''Village Politicians'' (1806), ''The Blind Fiddler'' (1806), ''Distraining for Rent'' (1815) and ''The Penny Wedding'' (1818). His most famous work was ''[[The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch]]'', one of the most popular exhibitions in London in 1822.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009pp678-9/&gt; His sketch ''Knox preaching before the Lords of the Congregation'' (1822), dealt with the historic themes that would become a major part of Scottish painting in the second half of the century and he would also be a major influence on oriental painting. Scottish painters influenced by Wilkie included [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]] (1784–1868), [[Alexander George Fraser]] (1785–1865) and [[Walter Geikie]] (1795–1837). A younger generation that took genre painting into the late nineteenth century included [[Erskine Nicol]] (1825–1904) and the brothers [[John Faed|John]] (1818–1902) and [[Thomas Faed]] (1826–1900).&lt;ref name=Macdonald2000pp84-7/&gt; Major themes included the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], particularly scenes involving John Knox and Mary Queen of Scots, the Covenanters, especially the "[[The Killing Time|Killing Time]]" of the 1680s, and the Jacobites.&lt;ref name=Macdonald2000pp96-7&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;96–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition to Egypt led by [[Napoleon]] in 1798 began the European trend for Orientalism.&lt;ref&gt;J. MacKenzie, ''Orientalism: History, Theory and the Arts'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1995), {{ISBN|0-7190-4578-9}}, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; For British artists the [[Napoleonic Wars|Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars]] (1793–1815) disrupted the established routes to Rome, while military expeditions to the Middle East and Spain created new areas of interest. [[William Allan (painter)|William Allan]] (1782–1850) travelled in Russia and Turkey from 1805 to 1822 and painted pictures of Russians and Turkish life. He travelled again to Turkey in the 1830s, which resulted in the production of works including ''The Slave Market: Constantinople'' (1838).&lt;ref name=Macdonald2000p93-4&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;93–4.&lt;/ref&gt; David Wilkie also visited the Middle East in search of authentic settings and decor for Biblical paintings.&lt;ref&gt;N.

==Sculpture==
{{Main|Sculpture in Scotland}}
[[File:Wallace Monument (8038773095).jpg|thumb|upright|David Watson Stevenson's statue of [[William Wallace]] on the exterior of the [[Wallace Monument]]]]
While opportunities and training for painters had made advances by the beginning of the nineteenth century, a Scottish tradition of sculpture was slower to emerge. In the early decades of the century commissions continued to be given to English artists, including [[Samuel Joseph (sculptor)|Samuel Joseph]] (1791–1850), who was working in Edinburgh in 1821–29 and was a founding member of the Scottish Academy. Thomas Campbell (c. 1790–1858) studied in London and settled in Rome, where he received commissions from visiting British subjects before returning to London in 1830. His works in Scotland included the Hopetoun Memorial (1824–34) in Edinburgh. [[Lawrence Macdonald]] (1799–1878) was able to study at the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh and then Rome. He returned to Edinburgh from 1827, but moved back to Rome in 1832, where he worked for the rest of his life. His most significant works included his busts of [[Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet|General David Baird]] and of the [[phrenology|phrenologist]] [[George Combe]] (c. 1830).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;90–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first significant Scottish sculptor to pursue their career in Scotland was [[John Steell]] (1804–91). He trained at the Trustee's Academy and in Rome and was elected to the Scottish Academy in 1830 while still in his twenties. His first work to gain significant public attention was his ''Alexander and Bucephasus''. His 1832 design for a statue of Sir Water Scott was incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. It marked the beginnings of a national school of sculpture based around major figures from Scottish culture and Scottish and British history. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was taken forward by artists such as [[Patric Park]] (1811–55), [[Alexander Handyside Ritchie]] (1804–70) and [[William Calder Marshall]] (1813–94). This reached fruition in the next generation of sculptors including [[William Brodie (sculptor)|William Brodie]] (1815–81), Amelia Hill (1820–1904) and Steell's apprentice David Watson Stevenson (1842–1904). Stevenson contributed the statue of [[William Wallace]] on the exterior of the [[Wallace Monument]] and many of the busts in the gallery of heroes inside, which included [[Robert the Bruce]], [[John Knox]], Walter Scott, [[Robert Burns]], [[James Watt]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Public sculpture was boosted by the centenary of Burns' death in 1896. Stevenson produced a statue of the poet in Leith. Hill produced one for Dumfries. John Steell produced a statue for [[Central Park]] in New York, versions of which were made for Dundee, London and Dunedin. Statues of Burns and Scott were produced in areas of Scottish settlement, particularly in North America and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;125–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography==
{{Main|Scottish photography}}
[[File:His Faither’s Breeks.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''His Faither's Breeks'', by [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] (1843–47)]]
According to photo historian David Burn "there is a good case to be made for the proposition that the greatest contribution that Scotland has made to the visual arts, possibly to the arts as a whole, is in the art of photography".&lt;ref name=Burn2011&gt;D. Burn, "Photography", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0-19-969305-6}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;476–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early nineteenth century Scottish scientists [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[David Brewster]] played a major part in the development of the techniques of photography. Pioneering photographers included chemist [[Robert Adamson (photographer)|Robert Adamson]] (1821–48) and artist [[David Octavius Hill]] (1821–48), who as [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. Their output of around 3,000 [[calotype]] images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; 

Adamson trained Thomas Roger (1833–88) of St. Andrews, who was one of the first commercial photographers and beside commercial portraits, produced many genre style compositions.&lt;ref&gt;R. Simpson, ''The Photography of Victorian Scotland'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|074865464X}}, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Other pioneers included [[Thomas Annan]] (1829–87), who took portraits and landscapes, and whose photographs of the Glasgow slums were among the first to use the medium as a social record.&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; his son [[James Craig Annan]] (1864–1946) also popularised the work of Hill &amp; Adamson in the US and worked with American photographic pioneer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] (1864–1946). Both pioneered the more stable [[photogravure]] process.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;146–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important figures included [[Thomas Keith (doctor)|Thomas Keith]] (1827–95), one of the first architectural photographers.&lt;ref&gt;H. Gernsheim, ''Creative Photography: Aesthetic Trends, 1839–1960'' (Courier Dover, 1962), {{ISBN|0-486-26750-4}}, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington Wilson]] (1823–93) pioneered [[instant photography]]&lt;ref name=Burn2011/&gt; and [[landscape photography]], becoming "photographer to the Queen" and his Aberdeen company was the largest producer of topographical prints by 1880.&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. G. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland, 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0-7486-0102-3}}, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clementina Hawarden]] (1822–65) produced posed portraits that were among the first in a tradition of female photography.&lt;ref&gt;G. Clarke, ''Photograph'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0-19-284200-5}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;51–2.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s amateur photographer Mary Jane Matherson took her camera outside to create compositions that can be described as genre art, including ''A Picnic in the Glen'' and ''An Angler at Rest''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Simpson, ''The Photography of Victorian Scotland'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|074865464X}}, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of the Nazarenes and Pre-Raphaelites==
{{Main|Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood}}
Scottish artists of the mid-nineteenth century were influenced by the painters of the [[Nazarene movement]], a group of German artists based in Rome, who attempted to revive the spirituality of Medieval and Early Renaissance art. They were also influenced by, and influenced, the work of the English Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who rejected the formalism of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] painting after [[Raphael]]. [[David Scott (painter)|David Scott]]'s (1806–49) learnt the art of [[fresco]] painting from the Nazarenes. He painted historical works, such as ''The Poles did nobly and the Russian General Craved and Armistice to bury his Dead'' (1832) and ''Traitor's Gate'' (1842). His most ambitious historical work was the [[triptych]] ''Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: the Spear and English War: the Bow'' (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''[[Ancient Mariner]]'', [[John Bunyan|Bunyan]]'s ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and [[J. P. Nichol]]'s ''Architecture of the Heavens'' (1850). Because of this early death he was known to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelites mainly through his brother [[William Bell Scott]] (1811–90), who became a close friend of founding member [[D. G. Rossetti]]. His most famous work, ''Iron and Coal'' was one of the most popular Victorian images and one of the few to fulfill the Pre-Raphaelite ambition to depict the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;205–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Dyce 002.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Dyce]] ''[[Pegwell Bay, Kent – a Recollection of October 5th 1858]]'' (c. 1859–60)]]
The figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born [[William Dyce]] (1806–64). He met the Nazarenes while in Italy and his work moved towards their "early Christian" art, as can be seen in his ''Madonna and Child'' (1848). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to [[John Ruskin]].&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; His later work was Pre-Raphaelite in its spirituality, as can be seen in his ''The Man of Sorrows'' and ''David in the Wilderness'' (both 1860). His ''Pegwell Bay: a Recollection of October 5th 1858'' has been described as "the archetypal pre-Raphaelite landscape".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Noel Paton]] (1821–1901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of [[John Everett Millais]] and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as ''The Bludie Tryst'' (1855). His later paintings, like those of Millais, have been criticised for descending into popular sentimentality.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Millais was [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (1823–1904) and whose work includes ''Summertime, Gloucestershire'' (1860)&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt; and who from 1861 began a series of [[Arthurian]]-based paintings including ''La Morte d'Arthur'' and ''Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Barber, ''The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief'' (Harvard University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0-674-01390-5}}, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts and Crafts==
{{See also|Arts and Crafts movement}}
The beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808–77). His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]] (c. 1880). Among his followers were Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] (1834–1904) was one of the first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement.  He produced carpets, ceramics, furniture, glass, graphics, metalwork, including silver and electroplate, including his angular teapot of 1879.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lyons, ''Christopher Dresser: The People Designer – 1834–1904'' (Antique Collectors' Club, 2005), {{ISBN|1-85149-455-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==Celtic Revival==

[[File:Edward Atkinson Hornel - Druids Bringing In The Mistletoe.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Druids Bringing in the Mistletoe'' by [[Edward Atkinson Hornel|E. A. Hornel]] (c. 1890)]]
The formation of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included a number of significant figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a [[Celtic Revival]], similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom.&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p170&gt;M. Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-7486-2027-3}}, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer [[Patrick Geddes]] (1854–1932), the architect and designer [[Robert Lorimer]] (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist [[Douglas Strachan]] (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at [[Ramsay Garden]] on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s. Among the figures involved with the movement were [[Anna Traquair]] (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh]] (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding.&lt;ref name=MacDonad2000p155-6&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;155–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant exponent of the revival was Dundee-born [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] (1866–1945), who was also influenced by [[Italian Renaissance art]] and French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects ''Tristan and Iseult'' (1912) and ''St Bride'' (1913). Other Dundee Symbolists included Stewart Carmichael (1879–1901) and George Dutch Davidson (1869–1950).&lt;ref name=MacDonad2000p155-6/&gt; Duncan was a major contributor to Geddes' magazine ''The Evergreen''. Other major contributors included the Japanese-influenced [[Robert Burns (artist)|Robert Burns]] (1860–1941), [[Edward Atkinson Hornel|E. A. Hornel]] (1864–1933) and Duncan's student Helen Hay (fl. 1895–1953).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', pp.&amp;nbsp;156–7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==Glasgow School==
{{Main|Glasgow School}}
[[File:Charles Rennie Mackintosh - The Wassail 1900.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] ''The Wassail'' (1900)]]
Developments in late nineteenth-century Scottish art are associated with the Glasgow School, a term that is used for a number of loose groups based around the city. The first and largest group, active from about 1880, were the [[Glasgow Boys]], including [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]] (1859–1930), [[Joseph Crawhall]] (1861–1913), [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]] (1858–1943) and [[Edward Arthur Walton|E. A. Walton]] (1860–1922).&lt;ref name=Billcliffe2009&gt;Billcliffe, ''The Glasgow Boys''.&lt;/ref&gt; They reacted against the commercialism and sentimentality of earlier artists, particularly the work associated with Royal Academy. They were particularly influenced by London-based US artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p131&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; and French painting, incorporated elements of [[impressionism]] and [[Realism (art)|realism]] into their work. They have been credited with rejuvenating Scottish art and with making Glasgow a major cultural centre.&lt;ref name=Chilvers2009p255&gt;Chilvers, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly later grouping, active from about 1890 and known as "The Four" or the "Spook School", was composed of acclaimed architect and artist [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (1868–1928), his wife the painter and [[Studio glass|glass artist]] [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]] (1865–1933), her sister the artist [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]] (1873–1921), and her husband, the artist and teacher [[Herbert MacNair]] (1868–1955). They produced a distinctive blend of influences, including the Celtic Revival, the Arts and Crafts Movement, and [[Japonisme]], which found favour throughout the [[modern art]] world of continental Europe and helped define the [[Art Nouveau]] style that would come to prominence in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tschudi-Madsen, ''The Art Nouveau Style: a Comprehensive Guide'' (Mineola, NY: Courier Dover, 2002), {{ISBN|0-486-41794-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;283–4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

'''Sharon Lutheran Church and Cemetery''' is a historic [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Church (building)|church]] and cemetery located near [[Ceres, Virginia|Ceres]], [[Bland County, Virginia]]. The church was built in 1883, and is a one-story, frame church, four bays long, with round-arched, stained-glass windows and a gable roof.  It features a projecting square tower with a bell-cast pyramidal roof and cross finial on the entrance facade.  The adjacent cemetery was established in 1817, and includes a collection of rare Germanic gravestones which are stylistically related to those found in the outlying churches of the [[Wythe County, Virginia|Wythe County]] German settlements.&lt;ref name=VAnom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Bland/010-0040_Sharon_Lutheran_Church_and_Cemetery_1979_Final_Nomination.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Sharon Lutheran Church and Cemetery |author=Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission Staff|date= November 1978}} and [http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Bland/Sharon_Lutheran_photo.htm ''Accompanying photo'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3724">'''''The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn''''' ({{lang-ga|'''Macgnímartha Finn'''}}) is a medieval [[Ireland|Irish]] narrative belonging to the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. As its title implies, it recounts the boyhood exploits of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]], the cycle's central figure. The most important manuscript is Laud 610: folio 118Rb-121Va, which is missing the ending; [[Kuno Meyer]] assigned the text to the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;Meyer, "Macgnimartha Find."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and development==
The Laud 610 manuscript was first edited by [[Kuno Meyer]] in 1881 for the [[France|French]] journal ''[[Revue Celtique]]''.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt; The text breaks off while Fionn investigates a ''[[sídhe]]'' or fairy mound, before his trip to Tara. Scholars have pointed out similarities between earlier versions of ''The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn'' and tales of the youth of the [[Ulster Cycle]] hero [[Cúchulainn]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, ''[[The Boyhood Deeds of Cúchulainn]]'' and ''[[Tochmarc Emire|The Wooing of Emer]]'', both found within the epic ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'', recount Cúchulainn's earning of a nickname through his feats, his training by a warrior woman ([[Scáthach]]) and his earning of a deadly spear (the [[Gáe Bulg]]).

==Plot==
The story begins with the death of Fionn's father [[Cumhal]], leader of the [[Fianna]], at the hands of [[Goll mac Morna]]. Cumhal's wife [[Muirne]] was pregnant at the time and eventually gave birth to their son, called Demne in his youth. Fearing for his safety, she sends the boy to be raised by Cumhal's sister, the druidess [[Bodhmall]], and her companion [[Liath Luachra]]. The two warrior women raise him and accompany him on several adventures, including one in which he receives his nickname, ''Fionn'' (the fair; the pale). As he grows, his exploits attract increasing attention, and finally his foster mothers send him away for fear that Goll's men will find him. Subsequent episodes depict his service to the king of [[Bantry]], his recovery of Cumhal's treasures by slaying [[Liath Luachra]] (a different character than his caretaker), and his meeting with the aged and dispossessed Fianna who had fought with his father. 

Another famous episode recounts how Fionn inadvertently eats the [[Salmon of Wisdom]], which would grant universal knowledge to whoever consumed it. He had been studying under the poet [[Finn Eces]], who had sought the fish for seven years. Finally he catches it, and has Fionn cook it for him. Fionn burns his thumb on the fish and puts it in his mouth, thereby receiving its gift of wisdom. 

Fionn travels to the capital of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]], which is set aflame each [[Samhain]] by [[Aillén]] the Burner, one of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]]. Goll and the Fianna are powerless to stop it, since Aillén puts everyone to sleep with a magical tune. Fionn inhales poison from his own spear to prevent sleep, and dispatches Aillén. He reveals his identity to the court, and the king grants Fionn his rightful position as leader of the Fianna. Goll steps down, and engages in a truce with his enemy.

'''''The Last Legion''''' is a 2007 action [[adventure film]] directed by [[Doug Lefler]]. Produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and others, it is based on the 2002 [[The Last Legion (novel)|novel of the same name]] written by [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]]. It stars [[Colin Firth]] along with Sir [[Ben Kingsley]] and [[Aishwarya Rai]], and premiered in [[Abu Dhabi]] on 6 April 2007.

The film is loosely inspired by the events of 5th-century European history, notably the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. This is coupled with other facts and legends from the history of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[fantasy|fantastic]] elements from the legend of [[King Arthur]] to provide a basis for the [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legend]].

== Plot ==
The film is narrated by Ambrosinus, native to Britain, who knows of a legend concerning the sword of [[Julius Caesar]], which was hidden away from evil men. It begins shortly before the coronation of [[Romulus Augustulus]] as [[Roman emperor|Emperor]] in [[anno Domini|AD]] 475.

Having travelled through much of the known world in search of Caesar's sword, Ambrosinus has then become the tutor to the young Romulus. A [[Druid]] and part of a secret brotherhood protecting the sword, he at times gives the impression he is a magician, but his "magic" is usually revealed to be simple trickery. One of the running concepts of the movie surrounds the question of whether or not Ambrosinus has any actual magical abilities or simply an illusionist. Romulus's father [[Flavius Orestes|Orestes]] rules Rome but is not Emperor himself.

On the day before the coronation, [[Odoacer]], commander of the barbarian [[Goths]] allied with Rome, demands a third of [[Italian Peninsula|Italy]] from Orestes, but is rebuffed. The same day, Romulus meets the general of the Nova Invicta Legion, Aurelianus Caius Antonius, called "[[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius]]".

The night after Romulus is crowned, Rome is attacked by the Goths. Most of Aurelius's men, pledged to protect the emperor, are killed, though Aurelius is only stunned and left for dead. Orestes and his wife are killed by Odoacer's lieutenant Wulfila, who captures Romulus.

The next day, Odoacer, now ruler of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]], plans to have Romulus killed. However, Ambrosinus convinces Odoacer to spare the boy. Instead, Romulus is exiled to [[Capri]] along with Ambrosinus, guarded by Wulfila and his men. His prison is a villa constructed more than four centuries earlier by the emperor [[Tiberius]].

With Ambrosinus's help, Romulus discovers a hidden chamber within the villa. He comes across a statue of Caesar holding the fabled sword, forged by a [[Chalybes|Chalybian]] smith after his [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|military campaigns in Britain]]. Writing near the statue's feet proclaims the sword was made for "he who is destined to rule". This is interpreted as a prophecy by various characters, and Romulus keeps the weapon.

The two are rescued from Capri by the loyal Aurelius and three surviving legionaries, Vatrenus, Batiatus, and Demetrius, accompanied by a female agent of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] – an [[Indian people|Indian]] warrior named Mira. They take Romulus to a seaport where the Eastern Roman Empire's emissary (whom Mira works for) and the [[Roman Senate|senator]] Nestor have promised safe passage to [[Constantinople]]. However, they barely escape after they learn the Senate and the Eastern Empire have betrayed them and sided with Odoacer.

Ambrosinus persuades Romulus to seek refuge in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], where the [[Legio IX Hispana|Ninth Legion]] (called the Dragon Legion) may remain loyal, being far from the events. They are followed by Wulfila and his men; the Goth covets Caesar's sword after learning the prophecy. Crossing the [[Alps]] and the [[English Channel]], the party travels to [[Hadrian's Wall]] and initially find no evidence of the legion until a farmer approaches and reveals he was its commanding general. With the collapse of Roman support of Britain, the legion had decided to disband and settle as farmers. Most of the men in the legion had married and had families. They also did not want to antagonise the powerful warlord [[Vortigern|Vortgyn]].
During their stay in the small [[Celts|Celtic]] village, Romulus meets and befriends a young girl named [[Igraine]]. Aurelius and Mira practice swordfighting and become close to each other. Ambrosinus told Romulus of a scar on his chest, similar to the design on the sword hilt, which he received from Vortgyn after he refused to tell him where the sword of Caesar was.

Vortgyn also desires the sword of Caesar as he aspires to rule the whole of Britain. It is revealed that Vortgyn and Ambrosinus are old enemies. After meeting with the Goths, Vortgyn decides to either capture or kill Romulus as a gesture to Odoacer. After confronting Igraine outside of the village, he convinces her to tell everyone in the village to surrender Romulus and has several of his men kill the blacksmith's wife and sons. When a tearful Igraine tells the villagers of what has happened, Aurelius confesses that Romulus is the emperor of Rome. The blacksmith then demands revenge on his wife's and sons' deaths, and Aurelius and his men decide to lead an army to Hadrian's Wall to face Vortgyn's armies in one final battle.

Before leaving the village, Romulus receives from Igraine a suit of Roman armour which belonged to her brother, which he has since outgrown. Aurelius, wielding Caesar's sword, leads his men and a small number of Celtic warriors against Vortgyn's forces at Hadrian's Wall. Mira, Batiatus, Demetrius, Romulus, and the archers pelt the infantry with arrows, while Aurelius, Vatrenus, and several Celtic soldiers struggled to hold the charging enemy at the open gate. Despite their casualties, Vortgyn's soldiers began to slowly overwhelm the small force on the wall. The battle appears hopeless until the rest of the Ninth Legion, having taken up their old Roman arms and uniforms, appear on the nearby ridgeline, and turn the tide of battle. The two warring sides cease their hostilities upon sighting Ambrosinus holding aloft Vortgyn's golden mask, after confronting and burning him alive at a tree-sanctuary of his secret brotherhood close to the battlefield.

After having fought and severely injured Aurelius, Wulfila is confronted by Romulus who is armed with Caesar's sword. Romulus stabs Wulfila in the chest, saying "that's for my mother", pauses, and further impales him, saying "that's for my father". He tells Aurelius that he fought like a dragon, whereupon Aurelius replies that Romulus fought like the son of a dragon.

Repulsed by the deaths in the battle, Romulus heaves away his sword which remarkably pierces a large rock and becomes lodged there. Many years later, Ambrosinus, now known by his Druid name, [[Merlin]], takes a young boy to the battlefield to describe the now legendary events. Merlin, who has visibly aged little since the battle, says that Aurelius married Mira and the two raised Romulus as their own son. He became a wise ruler, took the girl Igraine as his wife, and adopted the name "[[Uther Pendragon|Pendragon]]". The boy, Arthur, recognises Romulus as his father and Igraine as his mother.

In a final scene, the sword of Julius Caesar is shown embedded in the stone, with moss growing on the blade, covering the original inscription, leaving only the [[Latin]] letters which, when read as a single word, read [[Excalibur]].

==Production notes==
The film's producers include Dino De Laurentiis, Martha, his second wife, and Raffaella, his daughter by his first wife. Raffaella suggested director Doug Lefler due to his work on ''[[Dragonheart: A New Beginning]]'', which she produced. Filming took place in Tunisia and at [[Spiš Castle]] in eastern [[Slovakia]] in 2005.&lt;ref name = "notes"&gt;[http://www.firth.com/lastleg_notes.html The Last Legion — notes]. Retrieved 1 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]] helped adapt his novel to the screen, also acting as historical consultant. In an interview he states at least four hours of footage was shot but ultimately shortened or cut, including scenes of the heroes' journey through the Alps and the English Channel.&lt;ref name = "interview"&gt;Cavallini, Eleonora. "The Chalybes from Scythia to Britannia: Interview with Valerio Massimo Manfredi about the novel/movie The Last Legion." [http://www.mythimedia.org/doc/The%20Chalybes%20from%20Scythia%20to%20Britannia.pdf PDF] mythimedia.org. Retrieved 1 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the role of Aurelius, executive producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] suggested Colin Firth, known for playing [[Fitzwilliam Darcy]] in ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV serial)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1995) and more recently, [[Mark Darcy]] in the ''[[Bridget Jones]]'' films. Firth accepted the role due to the story, which he liked, and that it was very different from previous roles.&lt;ref name = "notes" /&gt;

[[Thomas Sangster]] (Romulus) was one of the last to be cast. He had previously worked with Firth in ''[[Love Actually]]'' (2003) and ''[[Nanny McPhee]]'' (2006), and their familiarity with each other benefited both.&lt;ref name = "notes" /&gt;

Sir Ben Kingsley was cast as Ambrosinus/Merlin after one meeting with Lefler. Kingsley was drawn to the mystique of the character, whom Lefler describes as a "warrior shaman". Kingsley also found the story interesting.&lt;ref name = "notes" /&gt;

Aishwarya Rai was cast as Mira after the filmmakers decided "somebody that had a rare beauty... who could move very well", in Lefler's words, was ideal for the role. Lefler touted Rai's training in dance as an asset for her fight scenes. Like Firth, Rai took the role as a change of pace from her previous work.&lt;ref name = "notes" /&gt;

The film's costumes were designed by Paolo Scalabrino, who had worked on ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' and ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]''.&lt;ref name = "notes" /&gt;

Lefler wanted each character to have a unique fighting style. Richard Ryan served as the film's sword master, helping him plan the fight scenes; he had worked on ''Troy'' and would work on ''[[Stardust (2007 film)|Stardust]]'' as such.&lt;ref name = "notes" /&gt;

The film's score was composed by [[Patrick Doyle]].

==Reception==
{{refimprove|date=May 2017}}
The film had a relatively poor reception by the public and critics. As of June 2010, the film had an average score of 37 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 12 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/lastlegion Last Legion, The (2007): Reviews]. [[Metacritic]]. Retrieved 22 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 16% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 55 reviews (9 "fresh", 46 "rotten"). The site's consensus reads, "With miscast leads and unoriginal, uninspired dialogue, ''The Last Legion'' pales in comparison to the recent cinematic epics it invokes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/last_legion/ The Last Legion — Rotten Tomatoes]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Retrieved 22 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from the novel==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The film departs from the novel in several ways; so much so that its credits state it to be "based in part" on the original.

In the novel, Aurelius (called ''Aurelianus Ambrosius Ventidius'') is a low-ranking officer and a legionary rather than a general, and his original legion, the Nova Invicta, is destroyed much earlier. The Nova Invicta Legion was known as the Emperor's Imperial Guard in the film, but in the novel it is a new legion formed by Flavius Orestes himself to defend the [[Western Roman Empire]]'s frontiers from barbarian attacks.

The novel's band of heroes includes three surviving legionaries (Aurelius, Vatrenus and Batiatus), a [[Venice|Venetian]] warrior woman called Livia Prisca, and two [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Gladiator|gladiators]], Demetrius and Orosius. The film turns Livia into the [[Indian people|Indian]] Mira, and Demetrius and Orosius into legionaries. While Demetrius remains a prominent supporting character, Orosius becomes an uncredited background extra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media-imdb.com/title/tt0462396/fullcredits IMDb — Full Cast]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film alters the capital of the Western Empire from its historical location at [[Ravenna]], as depicted in the novel, to Rome. By 460, Rome had not actually been the capital of the empire for nearly 200 years.

In the film, Romulus told his mother that "during the last five years, there have been five emperors and all of them were murdered". The five Roman Emperors Romulus mentioned were possibly [[Libius Severus]] (461–465), [[Anthemius]] (467–472), [[Olybrius]] (472), [[Glycerius]] (473–474), and [[Julius Nepos]] (474–475). While Libius Severus and Anthemius were in fact murdered by the Germanic-Roman general [[Ricimer]], Olybrius died of an illness and both Glycerius and Nepos were deposed. Glycerius was forced to surrender to Nepos in 474, to which Nepos spared his life and sent him into exile possibly in [[Dalmatia]]. Nepos ruled over the Western Empire for thirteen months before he was deposed by the Roman commander Orestes and was forced to flee to Dalmatia.

The film depicts the coronation of Romulus (and subsequent fall of Rome) as having taken place in 460, while the novel gives the year as 476. In point of fact, coronations were not invented until later in the Roman Empire (in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]]). Historically, Romulus was a [[usurper]] proclaimed by his father in 475. It is believed he was born in 460. Romulus' reign was never recognised as emperor except by his father's troops. The emperors of the East continued to regard Julius Nepos, who had fled Italy and reestablished himself in Dalmatia in the face of a rebellion by Orestes, as the legitimate Western Emperor. Romulus was Emperor for ten months, not a single day as in the film.

The "Last Legion" in the novel is a fictional Twelfth Legion (''Legio XII Draco''), not the [[Legio IX Hispana|Ninth]]. While the Ninth is called the "Dragon" Legion as in the novel, it was the "Hispanic" Legion (''[[Legio IX Hispana]]'') in real life. A Twelfth Legion did exist [[List of Roman legions|under different names]], but not as ''Draco''.

The prophecy concerning Romulus is worded differently in the novel: it speaks of a youth with a sword who will bring peace and prosperity to Britain, and the "eagle and the dragon" flying once more over the land (Manfredi makes these the dying words of the soldier-bishop [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]], whom he also makes the founder of the Dragon Legion).

In the film, [[Igraine]], Kustennin's daughter and Romulus' love interest, has an older brother, whereas in the novel, she is an only child.

In the novel, Ambrosinus (full Roman name ''Meridius Ambrosinus'', originally known as ''[[Myrddin Emrys|Myrdin Emries]]'' in Britain, which later becomes ''Merlin'') is a Christian and yet also a [[Druids|Druid]]. This is left unclear in the film, where he mostly speaks in generic terms of "truth" and "faith"; one exception is when he tells Vortgyn (spelled ''Wortigern'' in the novel) to "burn in Hell". In deleted scenes he uses more pagan terms to his language.

The final battle is identified as the [[Battle of Badon Hill]] in the novel but not in the film. In the novel, the opposing forces are listed here:

1. Aurelius Ambrosius Ventidius, Rufius Vatrenus, Cornelius Batiatus, Demetrius, Orosius, Livia Prisca, Romulus Augustulus, Ambrosinus, Kustennin, and the soldiers of the Twelfth Roman Legion(Legio XII Draco).

2. Wufila and two hundred barbarian horsemen, plus a contingent of [[Saxons|Saxon]] mercenaries.

The deaths of Vatrenus, Batiatus, Demetrius, and Orosius take place differently between the novel and the film. In the film, Vatrenus was killed by Eastern Roman soldiers while trying to protect Romulus and Batiatus was killed by Wufila during the Battle of Badon Hill, while Demetrius survived in the end (Orosius does not appear in the film). In the novel, Vatrenus, Demetrius, and Orosius were killed during the Battle of Badon Hill, while Batiatus survived.

The standard of the Dragon Legion is depicted as a bronze dragon with a red-and-white striped tail in the film. In the novel, the standard is a silver-headed, open-jawed dragon with a purple tail.

==Historical notes==

===Romulus Augustus and the "Fall of the Roman Empire"===
[[File:Roman Empires 476AD.svg|thumb|The Western Roman Empire (blue) in 476.]]

Orestes, who was partly of Germanic blood, was historically the ''[[magister militum]]'' – the senior officer of the Roman army second to the emperor. He had indeed promised his Germanic [[foederati]] a third of Italy to settle in but not to Odoacer personally. Orestes was himself a usurper, having promised the land to foederati to buy their quiescence in his rebellion against the legitimate emperor [[Julius Nepos]]. Although Orestes proclaimed his son, Romulus Augustus (derisively called ''Augustulus'', meaning "little Augustus") Emperor, the proclamation was not recognised as legitimate beyond the parts of the Italian Peninsula controlled by Orestes' troops. The common identification of Augustus as the "last Western Emperor" dates only from the publication of British historian [[Edward Gibbon]]'s [[History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]] in the late 18th Century.

At the time of his proclamation as Emperor, Romulus Augustus was 16, older than portrayed in the film. Upon being captured by Odoacer, the boy usurper was seen to be a victim of his father. He was spared and sent to live in comfortable retirement in southern Italy.

There was a struggle for control of the Eastern Roman Empire at the time but the Emperor alluded to would probably have been [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] (explicit in the novel). In truth, Zeno never recognised Romulus Augustus but recognised Julius Nepos as Emperor in the West until the latter's death in 480. At the behest of the Roman Senate, Zeno recognised Odoacer's administration of Italy; both he and Odoacer himself maintained the pretense of Nepos' reign. The Eastern Emperor eventually sent the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] foederati under [[Theodoric the Great]] to depose Odoacer when the latter proved disloyal.

===Anachronisms===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
The uniforms and weapons of the Ninth Legion as depicted in the film reflect an earlier period of Roman history than the film is set in. By 460, Roman [[legionaries]] did not wear scarlet cloaks, nor did they carry the semi-circular shields of ancient times, and the short stabbing sword known as the [[gladius]] had been replaced, mostly by the [[spatha]].

Mira's weapon, the [[Katar (dagger)|Katar]] (कटार), had not been invented at the time in which the action is set. Katars came into use more than 1000 years later.

A few of the castles and fortified cities in the film have round spires with pointed coned roofs, when in fact this style of buildings was not common until the late [[Middle Ages]].

During scenes in the film where people are shown riding horses one can clearly see [[stirrups]], even though that kind of stirrup did not come into use in Europe until after 700 AD.

===Last of the Line===

The Emperor [[Tiberius]] is referred to as "the last of [[Julius Caesar]]'s line". Inconsistently, Romulus Augustulus is also depicted as the last of Julius Caesar's family line and Tiberius as one of his ancestors. Tiberius was actually the second of the five [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]] emperors, succeeding to the role of emperor as the adopted son of [[Augustus]], who had himself been adopted by Julius Caesar. Augustus had named several of his own relatives as heirs, but as they all died, he named a son of his second wife, [[Livia]], by her first marriage. Thus, Tiberius was not the last of any line established by Julius Caesar (Augustus' maternal great-uncle by blood) as he had no blood relation to Caesar at all. His successors, [[Caligula]] and [[Claudius]] were blood relatives of Julius Caesar through a maternal blood line dating back to Augustus's older sister, [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]]. [[Nero]], a direct descendant of Augustus, ruled roughly twenty years after the death of Tiberius and was the final emperor of the Julio-Claudian Dynasty, thus making him the last ruler descended from Julius Caesar's family – the [[Julii]].

In the film it is implied that Romulus' descent from Caesar's family is through his (unnamed) mother (which is presumably why Orestes cannot be Emperor himself). Historically, nothing is known about Romulus's mother, but the Julii had been extinct for more than 400 years before Romulus was born.  The use of the title "Caesar" is also inaccurate. By the fifth century the title was generally used to refer to the designated heir, not an actual emperor or co-emperor, who bore the grander title of "[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]", all the way through to the final collapse of the East Roman ([[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]) Empire in 1453.

The clear implication in the film is that the Imperial office was [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary]], which was never the case from the tentative establishment of the position of Emperor under Augustus down through the death of the last Roman Emperor, [[Constantine XI]], during the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.  Emperors were proclaimed by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], the people, or the [[Roman army|army]].  They often associated their offspring as their junior partners or chosen successors, but there was nothing automatic about it.  "Legitimacy," by the fifth century, meant official recognition by the co-emperor, which Romulus Augustus never had.

===Flight to Britain===

The film portrays the fugitives as having no chance to find loyalists except in Britain, the whole of the West otherwise in Odoacer's hands.  In fact, Odoacer's rule did not extend beyond the Italian Peninsula.  Across the Adriatic in Dalmatia Emperor Julius Nepos still ruled; with the Eastern Empire stretching beyond.  Across Northern France, Roman legions cut off from Italy in the area historians now call the [[Domain of Soissons]] remained opposed to Odoacer.  In barbarian-ravaged [[Hispania]], Roman writ still ran in the major cities, and in what is now [[Morocco]], local [[Berbers|Berber]] leaders continued to regard themselves as loyal vassals.  Although the real usurper Romulus Augustus could not expect to find help in any of these places, he could have found safe haven if he required it.  Certainly they would have been more promising than late fifth century Britain, the Roman legions having [[End of Roman rule in Britain|departed the island]] for the continent in 407, more than half a century before the action of the film.

===Missing Ninth Legion===

The film uses the premise of the missing [[Legio IX Hispana|Ninth Legion]] still existing somewhere in Britain at this time, a once popular idea among British historians. The Ninth Legion disappears from Roman records from about 120 AD, and what happened to it is not known; however, it certainly was no longer in existence by the mid-2nd century, long before this movie is set.

Even if the Ninth had gone missing in the province, it is highly unlikely to have reappeared and continued in existence as a military force for the three centuries between AD 117 and 460, undocumented by the otherwise thorough Roman administration.

== Connections to Arthurian legend ==
The film shows King Arthur as a descendant of the last Roman imperial line. In ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' Arthur claims descent from [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] and is crowned Roman Emperor after defeating its (fictional) ruler, [[Lucius Tiberius]].

Aurelius is a fictionalised version of the historical war leader [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]], also known as Aurelius Ambrosius, who led the [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] against the invading [[Saxons]]. He was said by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] to have been the brother of Arthur's father [[Uther Pendragon]], and to have opposed [[Vortigern]] alongside his brother.

In [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical]] work ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|The History of the Kings of Britain]]'' (''Historia Regum Britanniae''), [[Merlin]], originally a figure unconnected with Arthur, is called ''Merlin Ambrosius'' after Geoffrey merged legends of Aurelius Ambrosius into the character. ''Ambrosius'' becomes ''Ambrosinus'' in the film. In the novel, Merlin's original British name Myrdin Emries is directly taken from Welsh versions of the tales.

Vortgyn's death by fire in a burning tree shelter/shrine echoes the legendary Vortigern's death, as according to Geoffrey of Monmouth the latter died in his tower when it was set aflame.

===Excalibur===
One of the movie's taglines is "Before King Arthur, there was [[Excalibur]]". The last shots of the film establish the sword of Caesar as the legendary blade (also the Sword in the Stone, originally a different weapon). A supernaturally powerful sword of Caesar's called [[Crocea Mors]] ("Yellow Death"), was supposed to have been buried in Britain with the body of [[Nennius of Britain]], according to [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]. The film merges this myth with that of Excalibur.

The word [[Excalibur]] comes from the Old French ''Escalibor'' which is itself a corruption of ''Caliburnus'' or ''[[Caliburn]]''. The name ''Caliburn'' is often held to be Geoffrey of Monmouth's Latinized form of the original Welsh ''[[Caledfwlch]]'', which combines the elements ''{{lang|cy|caled}}'' ("hard"), and  ''{{Lang|cy|bwlch}}'' ("breach, gap, notch").&lt;ref&gt;R. Bromwich and D. Simon Evans, ''Culhwch and Olwen. An Edition and Study of the Oldest Arthurian Tale'' (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992), pp.64–5&lt;/ref&gt; Manfredi espouses an alternative theory wherein ''Caliburn'' derives from Latin ''chalybs'' "steel", which is in turn derived from ''[[Chalybes]]'', the name of an [[Anatolia]]n ironworking tribe.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The sword in the film bears the inscription CAI • IVL • CAES • ENSIS CALIBVRNVS. The characters "CAI. IVL. CAES." are an abbreviated form of ''Caius'' (or Gaius) ''Julius Caesar''. Manfredi loosely translates ''ensis caliburnus'' as "sword of steel". ''Ensis'' is one of the Latin words for "sword".&lt;ref name = "interview" /&gt; While in reality Geoffrey of Monmouth's Latinization ''Caliburn'' eventually developed into the form ''Excalibur'', the film explains the origin of the name ''Excalibur'' by having the inscription obscured by moss; the remaining letters spell out E S CALIBVR.

==Connections to other films==
The film has similarities to ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'' (2004). Both are set in Britain after the Romans left, and as [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]] states, both feature a band of heroes escorting a boy of special status and a battle set at [[Hadrian's Wall]].&lt;ref name = "interview" /&gt; [[Kevin McKidd]] who appears in ''The Last Legion'' co-stars as [[Lucius Vorenus]] in the HBO drama series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'' with [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]] as [[Titus Pullo]] who had a supporting role in ''King Arthur''.

'''''The Road Goes Ever On''''' is a [[song cycle]] that has been published as a book of [[sheet music]], and as an audio recording.  The music was written by [[Donald Swann]], and the words are taken from poems in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] writings, especially ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

The title of this opus is taken from "[[The Road Goes Ever On (song)|The Road Goes Ever On]]", the first song in the collection.  The songs form a [[song cycle]], designed to fit together when played in sequence.

== Musical and lyrical content ==

With Tolkien's approval, Donald Swann wrote the music for this song cycle, and much of the music resembles English traditional music or folk music.  The sole exception is the [[Quenya]] song "[[Namárië]]", which was based on a tune by Tolkien himself and which has some affinities to [[Gregorian chant]].

This book has been valued even by those uninterested in the music, since it helps Tolkien's readers to better understand the [[culture]]s of the various mythological beings presented in Middle-earth, and helps [[linguistics|linguist]]s analyse Tolkien's poetry. For example, it contains one of the longest samples of the language [[Quenya]] (in the song "Namárië"), as well as the [[Sindarin]] prayer "A Elbereth Gilthoniel" with grammatical explanations.

Also, in addition to the sheet music, the book includes an introduction that contains additional information about Middle-earth. Prior to the publication of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', this introduction was the only publicly available source for certain information about the [[First Age]] of Middle-earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Publication history (book and audio recordings) ==

The first edition of ''The Road Goes Ever On: a Song Cycle'' was published on 31 October 1967, in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christina Scull]] &amp; [[Wayne G. Hammond]] (2006), ''[[The J. R. R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]'', HarperCollins, 'Chronology' volume p.710; {{ISBN|978-0-618-39113-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Gramophone record|LP record]] of this song cycle was recorded on 12 June 1967, with Donald Swann on piano and William Elvin singing.  Side one of this record consisted of Tolkien himself reading five poems from ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.  The first track on side two was Tolkien reading the Elvish prayer "[[A Elbereth Gilthoniel]]".  The remainder of side two contained the song cycle performed by Swann and Elvin.&lt;ref&gt;See the scans of the LP jacket [http://www.donaldswann.co.uk/DS-LP2details.html here] and [http://rarelibrary.com/book/COL-C/151/POEMS+AND+SONGS+OF+MIDDLE+EARTH+LP+RECORD+ALBUM.html here], as well as the list of tracks [http://www.discogs.com/release/1039597 here].&lt;/ref&gt; This LP record, entitled '''''Poems and Songs of Middle Earth''''' and released by [[Caedmon Audio|Caedmon Records]] (TC 1231), is long out of print and very difficult to find.

The second edition of ''The Road Goes Ever On'', published in 1978, added music for "[[Bilbo's Last Song]]."  This song was also published separately.

The third edition, published in 1993, added music for "Lúthien Tinúviel" from ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', which had earlier appeared in ''The Songs of Donald Swann: Volume I''.  The third edition of ''The Road Goes Ever On'' was packaged with a [[Compact disc|CD]] that duplicated the song cycle (but not Tolkien's readings) from  the 1967 LP record.  The CD also included two new recordings.  The third edition was reprinted in hardcover in 2002 by Harper Collins  ({{ISBN|0-00-713655-2}}); this had the same text and CD as the 1993 edition.

On 10 June 1995, the song cycle was performed in Rotterdam under the auspices of the Dutch Tolkien Society, by the baritone Jan Krediet together with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070518051649/http://members.chello.nl/n.jaspers1/EnSuite/ chamber choir EnSuite] and Alexandra Swemer on the piano. A CD of this concert was published in a limited edition.

'''''The Tall Man''''' is a half-hour American [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]] about Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]] and the gunfighter [[Billy the Kid]] that aired seventy-five episodes on [[NBC]] from 1960 to 1962, filmed by [[Revue Productions]]. It was also &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinanews.com/tp/hd2011/2012/09-21/U399P4T426D134544F16470DT20120921103210.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; theatrically released and dubbed in [[North Korea]] in the 1960s.

The series is set in the late 1870s and early 1880s, and also depicts other figures of the period, such as [[John Tunstall]] and [[Lew Wallace]].

==Synopsis==
[[File:Pat Garrett2.jpg|left|thumb|125px|The real [[Pat Garrett]]]]
''The Tall Man'' stars 6'3" [[Barry Sullivan (actor)|Barry Sullivan]] as Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]], and [[Clu Gulager]] as [[Billy the Kid]].    Gulager was 32 in 1960, 11 years older than Billy the Kid was at the time of his death in 1881 at the age of 21.  The highly fictionalized series provides a more humane image of the Kid than has history itself.  In real life Garrett eventually shot Billy dead in a night-time ambush at a farmhouse in [[Fort Sumner, New Mexico|Fort Sumner]], [[New Mexico]], but no concluding episode depicting the grim conclusion was filmed.  Set in and about [[Lincoln, New Mexico]], the series opens with a view of the extremely long shadow cast by Sullivan on a Western street, hence the name "the tall man".

In the premiere episode, "Garrett and the Kid" (September 10, 1960), Garrett arrives in Lincoln, depicted in the series as a gold-mining [[boomtown]], as the new deputy sheriff, only to learn that a crooked saloon owner, Paul Mason ([[Robert Middleton]]), dominates the community, including the marshal, Dave Leggert ([[Denver Pyle]]). When he sees his power threatened, Mason tries to hire Billy to kill Garrett, unaware that the two were then on friendly terms. [[Vaughn Taylor (actor)|Vaughn Taylor]] is cast in this episode as Judge Riley, and [[King Donovan]] appears as a Mason henchman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717585/|title=Garrett and the Kid|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Three Worlds''''' is a [[Lithography|lithograph]] print by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[M. C. Escher]] first printed in December 1955.

''Three Worlds'' depicts a large pool or lake during the autumn or winter months, the title referring to the three visible perspectives in the picture: the surface of the water on which [[leaf|leaves]] [[Buoyancy|float]], the world above the surface, observable by the water's [[mirror|reflection]] of a [[forest]], and the world below the surface, observable in the large [[fish]] swimming just below the water's surface.

Escher also created a picture named ''Two Worlds''.

The picture is based on true optical effects, reflection and refraction. The angle of incidence is the line between the reflection of the trees and refraction allowing the view of the fish.

{{nihongo|'''Tomonobu Imamichi'''|今道 友信|Imamichi Tomonobu}} (November 19, 1922 – October 13, 2012) was a [[Japanese philosopher]] who studied [[Chinese philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Mainichi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mainichi.jp/select/news/20121017k0000m060019000c.html|script-title=ja:訃報:今道友信さん８９歳＝東大名誉教授エコエティカ提唱|date=16 October 2012|publisher=''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]''|language=Japanese|accessdate=17 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130112022432/http://mainichi.jp/select/news/20121017k0000m060019000c.html|archivedate=12 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Life==
Imamichi taught in Europe (Paris and Germany) as well as in Japan (he was also emeritus professor of the [[University of Palermo]]). Beginning in 1979 he was the president of the ''[[Centre International pour l'Étude Comparée de Philosophie et d'Esthétique]]'' and after 1997 of the [[International Institute of Philosophy]]. In 1976 he founded the journal ''Aesthetics''.

He translated [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' into Japanese (in 1972) and has written numerous books in Japanese. Imamichi was a supporter of [[transculturation|communication between cultures]]. He characterizes [[Western philosophy]] as an attempt to achieve a God's eye view (''das in-dem-Gott-sein''; to be in the being of God) and [[Eastern philosophy]] as an attempt to be in the world (''das in-der-Welt-sein''). Imamichi sees in both stances two incomplete and complementary [[humanism]]s, and observes that since the publication of ''[[The Book of Tea]]'', some Western philosophers have adopted a more Eastern stance while other Eastern philosophers have attempted to reach the Absolute or the Eternal.

Tomonobu Imamichi was the father of guitarist and songwriter [[Tomotaka Imamichi]], pianist Nobuko Kawaguchi, biologist Yukiko Imamichi and psychologist Tomoaki Imamichi.

[[Image:Wien NHM Venus von Willendorf.jpg|thumb|[[Venus of Willendorf]]]]
A '''Venus figurine''' is any [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[Figurine|statuette]] portraying a woman,&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740"&gt;Fagan, 740&lt;/ref&gt; with fewer images depicting men or figures of uncertain sex,&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 203&lt;/ref&gt; and those in [[relief]] or engraved on rock or stones are often discussed together.&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741"&gt;Fagan, 740-741&lt;/ref&gt; Most have been unearthed in [[Europe]], but others have been found as far away as [[Siberia]], extending their distribution across much of [[Eurasia]], although with many gaps, such as the [[Mediterranean]] outside Italy.&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741; Beck, 203"&gt;Fagan, 740-741; Beck, 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of them date from the [[Gravettian]] period (26,000–21,000 years ago),&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741"/&gt; but examples exist as early as the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]], which dates back at least 35,000 years to the [[Aurignacian]], and as late as the [[Venus of Monruz]], from about 11,000 years ago in the [[Magdalenian]].  These [[figurine]]s were carved from soft stone (such as [[steatite]], [[calcite]] or [[limestone]]), bone or ivory, or formed of [[clay]] and fired. The latter are among the oldest [[ceramic]]s known. In total, some 144 such figurines are known;&lt;ref&gt;Cook&lt;/ref&gt; virtually all of modest size, between 3&amp;nbsp;cm and 40&amp;nbsp;cm or more in height.&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740"/&gt;  They are some of the earliest works of [[prehistoric art]].

Most of them have small heads, wide hips, and legs that taper to a point. Various figurines exaggerate the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva, although many do not, and the concentration in popular accounts on those that do reflects modern preoccupations rather than the range of actual artefacts. In contrast, arms and feet are often absent, and the head is usually small and faceless.  Depictions of hairstyles can be detailed, and especially in Siberian examples, clothing or tattoos may be indicated.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, 740-741; Isabella, Jude, interview with April Nowell.

The original cultural meaning and purpose of these artifacts is not known. It has frequently been suggested that they may have served a ritual or symbolic function.  There are widely varying and speculative interpretations of their use or meaning: they have been seen as religious figures,&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 207-208&lt;/ref&gt; as [[erotic art]] or sex aids,&lt;ref&gt;Rudgley, Richard, ''The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age'', 2000, Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|0684862700}}, 9780684862705194-198, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vhSHn-B89A0C&amp;pg=PA194 google books]; Fagan, 740-741&lt;/ref&gt; grandmother goddesses or as self-depictions by female artists.&lt;ref&gt;William Haviland, Harald Prins, Dana Walrath, Bunny McBride, ''Anthropology: The Human Challenge'', 13th edition, 2010, Cengage Learning, {{ISBN|0495810843}}, 9780495810841,[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fm2RY5ZKmDIC&amp;pg=PA220 google books]; Cook; Beck, 205-208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lawson |first1=Alex |url=https://www.metafilter.com/177818/The-Talk-for-45-year-old-women#7569728 |website=MetaFilter |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Venus impudique (1907 drawing).jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Vénus impudique]]'', 1907 drawing]]
The expression 'Venus' was first used in the mid-nineteenth century by the [[Paul Hurault, 8th Marquis de Vibraye|Marquis de Vibraye]], who discovered an important ivory figurine and named it ''[[Vénus impudique|La Vénus impudique]]'' or ''Venus Impudica'' ("immodest Venus"), contrasting it to the ''[[Venus Pudica]]'', [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] sculpture by [[Praxiteles]] showing [[Aphrodite]] covering her naked pubis with her right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 202-203&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the name is metaphorical as there is no link between the figurines and the [[Venus (mythology)|Roman goddess Venus]], although they have been interpreted as representations of a primordial female goddess. The term has been criticised for being more a reflection of modern western ideas than reflecting the beliefs of the sculptures' original owners, but the name has persisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Dr. Beth Harris &amp; Dr. Steven Zucker|date=27 May 2012|title= Nude Woman (Venus of Willendorf), c. 28,000-25,000 B.C.E.|trans-title= |medium= youtube video|language= English|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENAZqOoOVaI&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player|access-date= 1 June 2015|archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= 0:21|location= |publisher= Smarthistory, Art History at Khan Academy|id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of discovery ==
''[[Vénus impudique]]'', the figurine that gave the whole class its name, was the very first Paleolithic sculptural representation of a woman discovered in modern times. It was found in about 1864 by [[Paul Hurault, 8th Marquis de Vibraye]] at the famous archaeological site of [[Laugerie-Basse]] in the [[Vézère]] valley (one of the many important Stone Age sites in and around the commune of [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]] in [[Dordogne]], southwestern [[France]]). The [[Magdalenian]] "Venus" from Laugerie-Basse is headless, footless, armless but with a strongly incised vaginal opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Four years later, Salomon Reinach published an article about a group of [[steatite]] figurines from the caves of Balzi Rossi. The famous [[Venus of Willendorf]] was excavated in 1908 in a [[loess]] deposit in the [[Danube]] valley, [[Austria]]. Since then, hundreds of similar figurines have been discovered from the [[Pyrenees]] to the plains of [[Siberia]]. They are collectively described as "Venus figurines" in reference to the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] goddess of beauty, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], since the [[prehistory|prehistorians]] of the early 20th century assumed they represented an ancient ideal of beauty. Early discourse on "Venus figurines" was preoccupied with identifying the race being represented and the [[steatopygous]] fascination of [[Saartjie Baartman]], the "Hottentot Venus" exhibited as a living ethnographic curiosity to connoisseurs in Paris early in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Of the mammoth-ivory figurine fragment known as ''La Poire'' ("the pear") from her massive thighs, Randall White (White 2006:263, caption to fig. 6) observed the connection.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, archaeologists from the [[University of Tübingen]] discovered a 6&amp;nbsp;cm figurine woman carved from a [[mammoth]]'s tusk, the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]],  dated to at least 35,000 years ago, representing the earliest known sculpture of this type, and the earliest known work of [[figurative art]] altogether.  The ivory carving, found in six fragments in Germany's [[Hohle Fels]] cave, represents the typical features of Venus figurines, including the swollen belly, wide-set thighs, and large breasts.&lt;ref name=Conard2009&gt;{{cite journal | last= Conard | first= Nicholas J | title= A female figurine from the basal Aurignacian of Hohle Fels Cave in southwestern Germany | journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=459 | issue=  7244| pages= 248–252 | date=14 May 2009 | url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7244/pdf/nature07995.pdf | issn= | doi= 10.1038/nature07995 | accessdate= 27 July 2010  | pmid= 19444215|bibcode = 2009Natur.459..248C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cressey2009&gt;{{Cite journal |date=13 May 2009 |author=Cressey, Daniel |title=Ancient Venus rewrites history books |journal=Nature |series=News |doi=10.1038/news.2009.473 |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[Image:Vestonicka venuse edit.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Venus of Dolní Věstonice]], the earliest discovered use of ceramics&lt;ref&gt;The body used is the local [[loess]], with only traces of clay; there is no trace of surface burnishing or applied pigment. Pamela B. Vandiver, Olga Soffer, Bohuslav Klima and Jiři Svoboda, "The Origins of Ceramic Technology at Dolni Věstonice, Czechoslovakia", ''Science'', New Series, '''246''', No. 4933 (November 24, 1989:1002-1008).&lt;/ref&gt; (29,000 BCE – 25,000 BCE)]]

The majority of the Venus figurines appear to be depictions of women, many of which follow certain artistic conventions, on the lines of schematisation and stylisation. Most of them are roughly [[lozenge]]-shaped, with two tapering terminals at top (head) and bottom (legs) and the widest point in the middle (hips/belly). In some examples, certain parts of the human anatomy are exaggerated: [[abdomen]], [[hip (anatomy)|hips]], [[breast]]s, [[thigh]]s, [[vulva]]. In contrast, other anatomical details are neglected or absent, especially arms and feet. The heads are often of relatively small size and devoid of detail. Some may represent pregnant women, while others show no such signs.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 29; Fagan, 740-741; Cook; Beck, 203-213, who analyses attempts to classify the figures.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that aspects of the typical depiction and perspective, such as the large and often pendulous breasts, emphasis on the upper rather than lower buttocks, and lack of feet and faces, support the theory that these are self-portraits by women without access to mirrors, looking at their own bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Cook; McDermott, LeRoy. 1996. "Self-representation in Upper Paleolithic Female Figurines". ''Current Anthropology'' 37 (2). [University of Chicago Press, Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research]: 227–75. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2744349 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The absence of feet has led to suggestions that the figures might have been made to stand upright by inserting the legs into the ground like a peg.

The high amount of fat around the buttocks of some of the figurines has led to numerous interpretations. The issue was first raised by Édouard Piette, excavator of the [[Brassempouy]] figure and of several other examples from the Pyrenees. Some authors saw this feature as the depiction of an actual physical property, resembling (but ''not'' depicting) the [[Khoisan]] tribe of southern [[Africa]], while others interpreted it as a symbol of fertility and abundance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Recently, similar figurines with protruding buttocks from the prehistoric [[Jōmon period]] Japan were also interpreted as [[steatopygia]] of local women, possibly under nutritional stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hudson MJ, etal |title=Possible steatopygia in prehistoric central Japan: evidence from clay figurines |journal=Anthropological Science  |volume=116 |issue=1 |pages=87–92 |year=2008| doi=10.1537/ase.060317 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/116/1/116_87/_html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (c.f.[[Jōmon Venus]])

The [[Venus of Willendorf]] and the [[Venus of Laussel]] bear traces of having been externally covered in [[red ochre]]. The significance of this is not clear, but is normally assumed to be religious or ritual in nature—perhaps symbolic of the blood of menstruation or childbirth.  Some buried human bodies were similarly covered, and the colour may just represent life.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

All generally accepted Paleolithic female figurines are from the [[Upper Palaeolithic]]. Although they were originally mostly considered [[Aurignacian]], the majority are now associated with the [[Gravettian]] and [[Solutrean]].&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741; Beck, 203"/&gt; In these periods, the more rotund figurines are predominant. During the [[Magdalenian]], the forms become finer with more detail; conventional stylization also develops.

==Classification==
A number of attempts to subdivide or classify the figurines have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 208-213 analyses several&lt;/ref&gt; One of the less controversial is that by Henri Delporte, simply based on geographic provenance.&lt;ref&gt;H. Delporte : ''L’image de la femme dans l’art préhistorique'', Éd. Picard (1993) {{ISBN|2-7084-0440-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguishes:
* the Venus figurines of the [[Pyrenees]]-[[Aquitaine]] group ([[Venus of Lespugue]], of [[Venus of Laussel|Laussel]] and of [[Venus of Brassempouy|Brassempouy]])
* the Venus figurines of the Italian  group ([[Venus of Savignano]] and of Balzi Rossi)
* the Venus figurines of the [[Rhine]]-[[Danube]] group ([[Venus of Willendorf]] and of [[Venus of Dolní Věstonice|Dolní Věstonice]])
* the Venus figurines of the [[Russia]]n group ([[Kostienki]] and [[Zaraysk]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/082/ant0820862.htm Hizri Amirkhanov and Sergey Lev. New finds of art objects from the Upper Palaeolithic site of Zaraysk, Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.membrana.ru/lenta/?8913 Membrana.ru], Венеры каменного века найдены под Зарайском&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Russia]] and [[Gagarino]] in [[Ukraine]])
* the Venus figurines of the [[Siberia]]n group ([[Mal'ta Venus]], Bouret' Venus).

According to [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], there are cultural connections between all these groups. He states that certain anatomical details suggest a shared Oriental origin, followed by a westward diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;Leroi-Gourhan, A., ''Cronología del arte paleolítico'', 1966, Actas de VI Congreso internacional de Ciencias prehistóricas y protohistóricas, Roma.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
There are many interpretations of the figurines, often based on little argument or fact.&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741"/&gt;

Like many prehistoric artifacts, the cultural meaning of these figures may never be known.  Archaeologists speculate, however, that they may be emblems of security and success, [[fertility]] icons, or direct representations of a [[mother goddess]]. The female figures, as part of Upper Palaeolithic portable art, appear to have no practical use in the context of [[subsistence]]. They are mostly discovered in settlement contexts, both in open-air sites and caves;&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741"/&gt; burial contexts are much rarer.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

At Gagarino in Russia, seven Venus figurines were found in a hut of 5 m diameter; they have been interpreted as [[apotropaic]] [[amulets]], connected with the occupants of the dwelling. [[Venus figurines of Mal'ta|At Mal'ta]], near [[Lake Baikal]] in Siberia, figurines are only known from the left sides of huts. The figurines were probably not hidden or secret amulets, but rather were displayed to be seen by all (a factor that may explain their wide geographic spread). An image of excess weight may have symbolized a yearning for  plenty and security.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Helen Benigni argues in ''The Emergence of the Goddess'' that the consistency in design of these featureless, large-breasted, often pregnant figures throughout a wide region and over a long period of time suggests they represent an archetype of a female Supreme Creator. Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age people likely connected the female as a creator innately tied to the cycles of nature: women were commonly believed to give birth and their menstrual cycles aligned with lunar cycles and tides.&lt;ref&gt;Benigni, Helen, ed.  2013.  ''The Mythology of Venus: Ancient Calendars and Archaeoastronomy''.  Lanham, Maryland : University Press Of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later female figurines and continuity ==
[[File:Statuette Mehrgarh.jpg|thumb|right|This figurine, c. 5500 – 2400 BCE, from [[Mehrgarh]] (in present-day Pakistan) has all of the common characteristics of a venus stone figurine]]
Some scholars and popular theorists suggest a direct continuity between the Palaeolithic female figurines and later examples of female depictions from the [[Neolithic]] or even the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert, ''Homo Necans'' (1972) 1983:78, with extensive bibliography, including [[Peter Ucko|P.J. Ucko]], who contested the identification with mother goddesses and argues for a plurality of meanings, in ''Anthropomorphic Figurines of Predynastic Egypt and Neolithic Crete with Comparative Material from the Prehistoric Near East and Mainland Greece'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Such views have been contested on numerous grounds, not least the general absence of such depictions during the intervening [[Mesolithic]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

A female figurine which has 'no practical use and is portable' and has the common elements of a Venus figurine (a strong accent or exaggeration of female sex linked traits, and the lack of complete lower limbs) may be considered to be a Venus figurine, even if from after the main Palaeolithic period. Figurines which match this definition, apart from date, have been found in the  [[Neolithic]] and into the [[Bronze Age]]. The period and location that a figurine came from will contribute to the opinion of a given archeologist, such that ceramic figurines from the late ceramic Neolithic may be accepted as Venus figurines, while stone figurines from later periods are not.  This is a matter of ongoing debate given the strong similarity between many figurines from the Palaeolithic, Neolithic and beyond. A reworked [[endocast]] of a [[brachiopod]] from around 6000 BC in Norway has been identified as a late Venus figurine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tidemann|first1=Grethe|title=Venus fra Svinesund|url=http://www.uniforum.uio.no/nyheter/2001/08/venus-fra-svinesund.html|website=Uniforum|publisher=[[University of Oslo]]|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This means that a given female figurine may or may not be classified as a Venus figure by any given archeologist, regardless of its date, though most archaeologists disqualify figurines which date from after the Paleolithic, even though their purpose could have been the same. For instance, the [[Mehrgarh]] figurine has all of the common characteristics of a venus stone figurine, including large breasts and incomplete legs, however it came from what is now [[Pakistan]] and also dates to 3000 BCE, which lies after the beginning of the Bronze Age.{{cn|date=November 2015}}
