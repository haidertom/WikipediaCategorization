The '''AOL search data leak''' was the release, in August 2006, of detailed search logs by [[AOL]] of a large number of AOL users. The release was intentional and intended for research purposes; however, the public release meant that the entire [[Internet]] could see the results rather than a select number of academics. AOL [[Sanitization (classified information)|did not identify users in the report]], but [[personally identifiable information]] was present in many of the queries. This allowed some users to be identified by their search queries, prominently a woman named Thelma Arnold.

== Overview ==
On August 4, 2006, AOL Research, headed by Dr. Abdur Chowdhury, released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing twenty million search [[Index term|keyword]]s for over 650,000 users over a 3-month period intended for research purposes. AOL deleted the search data on their site by August 7, but not before it had been mirrored and distributed on the Internet.

AOL did not identify users in the report; however, [[personally identifiable information]] was present in many of the queries. As the queries were attributed by AOL to particular user numerically identified accounts, an individual could be identified and matched to their account and search history by such information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

''[[The New York Times]]'' was able to locate an individual from the released and anonymized search records by cross referencing them with phonebook listings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Consequently, the ethical implications of using this data for research are under debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

AOL acknowledged it was a mistake and removed the data; however, the removal was too late. The data was redistributed by others and can still be downloaded from mirror sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AOL apologizes for release of user search data|url=http://news.cnet.com/AOL-apologizes-for-release-of-user-search-data/2100-1030_3-6102793.html?tag=nefd.top|accessdate=August 12, 2013|newspaper=CNET|date=August 7, 2006|author=Dawn Kawamoto|author2=Elinor Mills}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AOL search data mirrors |url=http://gregsadetsky.com/aol-data/ |accessdate=August 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://swap.stanford.edu/20121002021427/http://gregsadetsky.com/aol%2Ddata/ |archivedate=October 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, Business 2.0 Magazine on CNNMoney ranked the release of the search data #57 in a segment called "101 Dumbest Moments in Business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/101dumbest/2007/full_list/index.html | work=CNN | title=101 Dumbest Moments in Business: Full list}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
In September 2006, a class action lawsuit was filed against AOL in the [[U.S. District Court]] for the Northern District of California.

{{quote|The lawsuit accuses AOL of violating the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and of fraudulent and deceptive business practices, among other claims, and seeks at least $5,000 for every person whose search data was exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AOL sued over Web search data release|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6119218-7.html|accessdate=August 12, 2013|newspaper=CNET|date=September 25, 2006|author=Elinor Mills}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Notable users==
Although the searchers were only identified by a numeric ID, some people's search results have become notable for various reasons.

===Thelma Arnold===
Through clues revealed in the search queries, ''[[The New York Times]]'' successfully uncovered the identities of several searchers. With her permission, they exposed user #4417749 as Thelma Arnold, a 62-year-old widow from [[Lilburn, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Face Is Exposed for AOL Searcher No. 4417749|url=http://search-logs.com/user/4417749-thelma_arnold|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This privacy breach was widely reported, and led to the resignation of AOL's CTO, Maureen Govern, on August 21, 2006. The media quoted an insider as saying that two employees had been fired: the researcher who released the data, and his immediate supervisor, who reported to Govern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Consumer watchdog website ''[[Consumerist (blog)|The Consumerist]]'' posted a blog entry by editor Ben Popken identifying the anonymous user number 927&lt;ref&gt;[http://aolscandal.com/user/927-yoko_ono___anatai_dayo AOL user #927]&lt;/ref&gt; as having an especially bizarre and macabre search history.&lt;ref name="Popken1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sparking the interest of the Internet community, User 927 inspired a theatrical production, written by Katharine Clark Gray in Philadelphia. The play, also named ''User 927'', has since been cited on several of the same blogs that originally discovered the real user's existence.&lt;ref name="Popken2"&gt;{{cite web

The etymological meaning of the word [[:es:Audiovisualogía|audiovisualogy]] is linked, on the one hand, with the term [[audiovisual]], referring to the means jointly related to the view and the hearing and, on the other hand, to the suffix [[-logy|logy]], that refers to [[logos]], and that in Greek means ''treaty, knowledge''. Therefore, '''audiovisualogy''' must be understood as a study of the audiovisual media that, due to its broad meaning, could be related to either the cinema, the television or any other art.

It is also feasible to understand it as the means and art that combine fixed projected images (slides or digital support) in its ''montage'', accompanied by sounds of a different nature, therefore meaning a language different from the film, since it does not use the image in motion.

Although it was known in France as [[diaporama]] (slideshow)&lt;ref&gt;[https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4951590 The reinvention of the slideshow as photographic formula.]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1950, its current name of audiovisual art is truly accepted in many fields, such as in some institutions in the United Kingdom, like photo clubs and others with a high artistic level, as the ''Royal Photography Society'', among others.

From this perspective, it is also possible to develop a theory about the audiovisual art, thus defining it as the language that combines still images (pictures with sound), in a [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] that by its condition is displayed as in the cinema, in a room designed for that purpose.

== Historical background ==
The audiovisual art constitutes a means of expression which came before the cinema. In fact, projections of still images are really old. In 1660, [[Athanasius Kircher]] invented one of the first ''magic lanterns'' that worked as a real projector, which had a great diffusion afterwards.

Moreover, from another point of view, the prehistoric man could be considered as the first audiovisual spectator of humanity, who contemplated the static skies and the landscape in amazement, along with the sounds of nature coming from the animals and the storms. The cave paintings inside the caves ended up representing the first screen of the humanity in the dark inside of a venue.

Much later, [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[Charles Marie Bouton]] were the first creators of the panoramas, i.e., large lounges with painted curtains, on which the light was projected in a zenith shape to give the illusion of reality. In 1822, the [[diorama]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midley.co.uk/diorama/Diorama_Wood_2.htm Daguerre and his Diorama in the 1830s: some financial announcements.]&lt;/ref&gt; built by both of them, became the ultimate expression of the current audiovisual art, since it modified the panorama by the layout of several overlapped curtains with themes of nature, which produced a changing effect when moving from one image to another by the dissolve effect, all this accompanied by sounds with a principle of action, development and final parts.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Luis Farjat. ''Audiovisualogy. The Audiovisual as Art and Mean of Communication'' [[:es:Audiovisualogía|Audiovisualogía]]. El audiovisual como arte y medio de comunicación. Colección de arte y memoria audiovisual. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The audiovisual concept as an art ==
One of the main foundations that defines this means as an art is its connection to [[painting]]. If the conditions are given like that, and the accompanying sound represents an expression which is also aesthetic, the attitude of contemplation separates the audiovisual concept from the physical world of the movement in the cinema and other means.

The attitude of contemplation of the fine arts necessarily implies a spiritualization of the emotions, where the classic spirit prevails.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Luis Farjat. Audiovisual Theory. ''Teoría Audiovisual. Colección de Arte y Memoria Audiovisual''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Leirens had already expressed that there are two ways to represent time. One is by representing it as it is, and the other one means exceeding it. He stated that the second way belongs precisely to the poetic creation.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Leirens. Le Cinema Et Le Temps Paperback – 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugenio Montes, when writing its ''Elementos of Filmología'' [Film-making Elements], announced that the calling of the classic period consisted of the stillness, since only things that are quiet consisted of something. On the contrary, when they moved, they already seemed inconsistent to the classic period. Because of this, the ancient spirit culminates in the sculptural attitude of the best gesture, set under a kind of eternity. That is what makes the difference with the cinema, which culminates its expression in the art of movement.

Another reason that justifies the audiovisual concept as an art is the use of the [[music]] that, represented accordingly with the still images, creates a new aesthetic expression by setting a different path, perhaps fairly unexplored, further accentuating the attitude of contemplation.

== The audiovisual montage ==
Considering these principles, the audiovisual montage may refer to two aspects: the [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] one, which alludes to the aesthetic connection of a shot with the next one, thus obtaining different forms, such as the analogy, the contrast and others. The other aspect is the extrinsic montage, which is the method of association point between a shot and the next one and that may be, for example, by a cut or by the so-called dissolve effect or lap dissolve between a still image and the one after it.

Like in the cinema, the intrinsic montage methods are very varied and represent a substantial element in the analysis of the construction of the audiovisual language.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Reisz.The technique of film editing'''.'''Focal, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences with the cinema ==

=== Analysis of the movement in the audiovisual art and the cinema ===
While the audiovisual art is always connected with a past of unfathomable character, the cinema can never be separated from the present time, because it depicts its physical representation. The few films that tend to an evocation of the still image do it only sometimes, to then return to what is their natural environment.

In the audiovisual art, the only movement expressed is the extrinsic montage of change from one shot to the next one, and while in the cinema this also happens, the internal movement of objects and characters of each one of the corresponding shots is added to its intrinsic montage, a movement that does not occur in the audiovisual art.&lt;ref&gt;“Montaje Cinematográfico, Arte de Movimiento” Rafael C. Sanchez. La Crujía. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

While the development of the aesthetic of the movement has for the cinema its purpose as an artistic means of expression,&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Spottiswoode.A Grammar of the film.1965&lt;/ref&gt; in the audiovisual art the method is a different one, more related to the contemplation.

A '''bandmaster''' is the leader and [[conducting|conductor]] of a [[band (music)|band]], usually a [[concert band]], [[military band]], [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]] or a [[marching band]].

==British Armed Forces==

In the [[British Army]], bandmasters of the [[Corps of Army Music]] now hold the rank of [[staff sergeant]], [[Warrant Officer (United Kingdom)|warrant officer class 2 or warrant officer class 1]]. A [[commissioned officer]] who leads a band is known as the director of music. Directors of music are all former bandmasters who have been commissioned. All bandmasters initially joined the Army as musicians and were selected for bandmaster training from non-commissioned rank (usually having reached the rank of at least [[corporal]]). However, unlike most NCOs, bandmasters are promoted directly to staff sergeant on completion of their bandmaster training and have not necessarily worked their way through all the available ranks.

British Army line [[infantry]] and [[cavalry]] [[regiment]]al bands were led by bandmasters until the reorganisation of bands and the creation of the Corps of Army Music in 1994. The larger [[corps]] bands, as well as those of the [[Foot Guards]] and [[Household Cavalry]], were known as staff bands, and were led by a commissioned director of music with a bandmaster as his deputy. In 1994, the number of bands was reduced and all bands became staff bands, effectively putting an end to the rank of 'bandsman' used in regimental line bands (the rank in staff bands being known as 'musician').

Bandmasters qualified before the reorganisation in 2014 were always immediately promoted to the rank of [[Warrant Officer (United Kingdom)|warrant officer class 1]], with the designation of WO1(BM). They wear a unique appointment badge of a [[Crown (headgear)|crowned]] [[lyre]] in a [[wreath]] underneath the WO1's badge (the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom). The senior playing musician of the band is normally the [[band sergeant major]] (or band corporal major in the Household Cavalry), a warrant officer class 2, although bandmasters (who are also appointed as training instructors) are expected to play within sections as and when required.

[[Royal Marines Band Service|Royal Marines Bands]] have been led by commissioned directors of music for many years. Bandmaster is an appointment which may be held by a warrant officer class 1 (WO1 BDMR), who is equivalent to an Army bandmaster, or a warrant officer class 2 (WO2 BDMR), who is equivalent to an Army band sergeant major. The Corps Bandmaster is the senior bandmaster of the Royal Marines and the chief non-commissioned adviser to the Principal Director of Music, Royal Marines. Until the introduction of warrant officers to the Royal Marines in 1973, the appointment of bandmaster was held by [[colour sergeant]]s and that of staff bandmaster by [[quartermaster sergeant]]s (equivalent to a warrant officer class 2), and there were no warrant officer class 1 equivalents in the Band Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=42131 |supp=y|notarchive=|page=5960|date=30 August 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Royal Air Force]] bands have also traditionally been led by commissioned directors of music. The bandmaster is a warrant officer and fills the same position as the Army equivalent (RAF WOs do not hold appointments as do those in the other services and the RAF only has a single WO rank, equivalent to WO1 in the other services). The senior playing musician, the band sergeant, is a [[flight sergeant]].

==United States Army==
In the [[United States Army]], a bandmaster of division and army garrison bands is typically a [[Warrant officer (United States)|warrant officer]] or a [[chief warrant officer]]. A commissioned officer typically leads major command and/or special bands.  The most recent manning documents have commissioned officers at 1st Armored Division, Ft. Bliss, TX and at 25th Infantry Division, Schofield Barracks, HI.  A warrant officer is typically commander of the Old Guard Band.

Warrant officer and chief warrant officer bandmasters are former enlisted musicians who have undergone rigorous in-service training in musical skills, conducting skills and military leadership. They are seconded in their individual bands by the senior enlisted bandmember, usually a [[first sergeant]] or [[sergeant major (United States)|sergeant major]], who is designated enlisted bandleader.

==The Salvation Army==
Bandmaster is a non-commissioned (or local) officer rank in [[The Salvation Army]]. A Salvation Army bandmaster is responsible for the ministry of a Salvation Army band and tends to the musical and spiritual development of the bandsmen and women. The bandmaster is assisted by a deputy bandmaster, band sergeant, and band secretary. These roles are also non-commissioned officer ranks. The band may also have a band colour sergeant and a band librarian. All of these roles will normally be undertaken by volunteer Salvationists who give their time and services free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;Orders and Regulations for Bands and Songster Bridgades; Orders and Regulations for Local Officers; Orders and Regulations for Corps Secretaries and Corps Treasurers&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Fry was the very first Salvation Army bandmaster.

==Cruise ships==
The term bandmaster is also used in the cruising industry to describe the onboard [[musical director]], responsible for musical direction for all onboard theatre shows with guest artists and for production shows, writing and [[arranging]] for the orchestras as well as band discipline.

'''Booth Mansion''' is a former [[town house]] at 28–34 Watergate Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.

==History==

In 1700 [[George Booth, 2nd Earl of Warrington|George Booth]] rebuilt two medieval houses as his town house.&lt;ref name=ward&gt;{{citation | last =Ward | first =Simon | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Chester: A History |edition= | publisher =Phillimore | year = 2009 | location =Chichester | pages = 74–75| isbn =978-1-86077-499-7 | postscript =&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He built a frontage in [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style,&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{Citation | last = Morriss| first = Richard| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 1993| title = The Buildings of Chester| publication-place = Dover| place = | publisher = Alan Sutton|  page = 97 | isbn = 0-7509-0255-8| postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; but behind this much of the medieval fabric was retained.

The top two floors of the building will be renovated and used as micro office space for artists studios and offices for startups, micro businesses operating in the creative industries.

==Architecture==

At a time when buildings elsewhere in the town had enclosed their portion of the [[Chester Rows|Rows]], the architect designing the frontage of Booth Mansion retained its section of the Row.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt;  The frontage is built in brick with stone [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]]; it has eight [[bay (architecture)|bays]] and two storeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hartwell | first = Clare |last2 = Hyde | first2 = Matthew |last3 = Hubbard | first3 = Edward | author3-link=Edward Hubbard | last4 =Pevsner | first4 =Nikolaus | author4-link =Nikolaus Pevsner | series= The Buildings of England| title = Cheshire |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]]| year =2011| origyear=1971| location =New Haven and London| pages = 264–265| isbn =978-0-300-17043-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Behind the frontage is medieval stonework and timber; the roof is of grey slates.  At the street ([[undercroft]]) level are shop fronts and doorways between nine stone [[Pier (architecture)|piers]].  At the Row level, overlooking the street, are three piers and six [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] [[column]]s. In the storey above the row are eight tall windows, each with four leaded lights, above which is a [[string course]].  The top storey has eight six-light [[sash window]]s.  Above these is a [[cornice]] and, from the roof, four [[gable]]d [[dormer]]s with two-pane [[casement window]]s protrude.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

===Interior===
In the undercroft is a medieval stone [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] and a wooden [[joist]] which has been dated by [[dendrochronology]] to 1260–80.  At the level of the Row, a 13th-century oak doorway remains from the medieval hall.  In the storey above the Row is the 18th-century assembly room which measures 16m by 10m and stretches across the full width of the building.  The room is panelled and has a fireplace against the east wall.  Elsewhere the medieval details of rooms has been obscured by modern additions.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

'''''Christmas in the Brothel''''' ({{lang-no|'''Julaften i bordell'''}}) is an oil-on-canvas painting by Norwegian painter [[Edvard Munch]]. The Expressionist painting was completed in 1903–04 and is housed at the [[Munch Museum]] in Oslo.

==Background==
The painting was done at a difficult time for Munch: a commission for a portrait in Hamburg (of a Senator Holthusen, the father in law of Munch's patron [[Max Linde]]) had come to naught because of disagreements. As a result, Munch suffered anxieties, which he attempted to manage with alcohol. A visit to a brothel in Lübeck is supposedly the background to ''Christmas in the Brothel'', a "light yet melancholy" painting in which the working girls in a brothel have just finished decorating a Christmas tree. "Ironic, sentimentally unholy", the painting is interpreted as a commentary on both Linde's upper-class household (where Munch was staying at the time) and Munch's own "pietistic home background".&lt;ref name="Bischoff2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bischoff|first=Ultich|title=Edvard Munch, 1863–1944|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETahibk334cC&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=9 April 2013|year=2000|publisher=Taschen|isbn=9783822859711|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other paintings of the period, it shows Munch's association with [[Fauvism]].&lt;ref name="Clement1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clement|first=Russell T|title=Les Fauves: a sourcebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaMyvjUZhIC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=9 April 2013|year=1994|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=9780313283338|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution was a favored topic of Munch's, and one particular room in a German brothel would later inspire an entire series of paintings, ''The Green Room''.&lt;ref name="Ringdal2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ringdal|first=Nils Johan|title=Love for Sale: A World History of Prostitution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYTW_eUOAesC&amp;pg=PA251|accessdate=9 April 2013|year=2007|publisher=Grove|isbn=9781555848088|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clive Bell.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of Clive Bell by [[Roger Fry]] (1924 c.)]]

'''Arthur Clive Heward Bell''' (16 September 1881 – 17 September 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/abstract/10.1093/acref/9780199754694.001.0001/acref-9780199754694-e-179|title=Bell, Arthur Clive Heward - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754694.001.0001/acref-9780199754694-e-179|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English [[art critic]], associated with [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] and the [[Bloomsbury Group]].

==Biography==
===Origins===
Bell was born in [[Great Shefford|East Shefford]], Berkshire, in 1881, the third of four children of William Heward Bell (1849–1927) and Hannah Taylor Cory (1850–1942). He had an elder brother ([[William Cory Heward Bell|Cory]]), an elder sister (Lorna, Mrs Acton), and a younger sister (Dorothy, Mrs Hony). His father was a civil engineer who built his fortune in the family coal mines in [[Wiltshire]] in England and [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in Wales – "a family which drew its wealth from Welsh mines and expended it on the destruction of wild animals".&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Quentin ''Bloomsbury'', London: Futura 1974, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; They lived at Cleeve House, [[Seend]], near [[Devizes]], Wiltshire, which was adorned with Squire Bell's many hunting trophies.

===Marriage and other liaisons===
He was educated at the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] [[Marlborough College]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BL899AC|name=Bell &lt;nowiki&gt;[post Clive-Bell]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Arthur Clive Heward}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied history. In 1902 he received an Earl of Derby scholarship to study in Paris, where his interest in art originated. Upon his return to England, he moved to London, where he met and married artist [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa Stephen]], sister of [[Virginia Woolf]], early in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070427090745/http://www.infobritain.co.uk/Virginia_Woolf_Biography_And_Visits.htm Virginia Woolf biography and visits], infobritain.co.uk; accessed 2 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yomCB&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=Myg8XQLso2%2FEgA9%2FcYHFzA&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry: Bell Arthur Clive H.| accessdate=24 May 2016|work=Transcription of English and Welsh marriage registrations 1837–1983|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yomVS&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=fuHZxw%2F0iO%2BQ1Jtk%2BoF00A&amp;scan=1| title=Index entry: Stephen Vanessa| accessdate=24 May 2016|work=Transcription of English and Welsh marriage registrations 1837–1983| publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clive and Vanessa had two sons, [[Julian Bell|Julian]] and [[Quentin Bell|Quentin]], who both became writers. Julian joined the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] side in the [[Spanish Civil War]] as an ambulance driver and was killed in 1937 by an enemy shell, aged 29.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Hermione ''Virginia Woolf'', London: Vintage 1997 p. 697&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[World War I]] their marriage was over. Vanessa had begun a lifelong relationship with [[Duncan Grant]], and Clive had a number of liaisons with other women including Mary Hutchinson. However, Clive and Vanessa never officially separated or divorced. Not only did they visit each other regularly, they also sometimes spent holidays together and paid "family" visits to Clive's parents. Clive lived in London but often spent long stretches of time at the farmhouse of [[Charleston, Sussex]], where Vanessa lived with Duncan and her three children by Clive and Duncan. He fully supported her wish to have a child by Duncan and allowed his wife's only daughter, Angelica, to bear his surname.

Vanessa's daughter by Duncan, [[Angelica Garnett]] (née Bell), was raised as Clive's daughter until she married. She was informed, by her mother Vanessa, just prior to her marriage and shortly after her brother Julian's death, that Duncan Grant was her biological father.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Hermione ''Virginia Woolf'', London: Vintage 1997 p. 698. This deception forms the central message of her memoir, ''Deceived with Kindness'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;
   
According to historian Stanley Rosenbaum, "Bell may, indeed, be the least liked member of Bloomsbury... Bell has been found wanting by biographers and critics of the Group – as a husband, a father, and especially a brother-in-law. It is undeniable that he was a wealthy snob, hedonist, and womaniser, a racist and an anti-Semite (but not a homophobe), who changed from a liberal socialist and pacifist into a reactionary appeaser. Bell's reputation has led to his being underestimated in the history of Bloomsbury...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.P. Rosenbaum|title=Georgian Bloomsbury: Volume 3: The Early Literary History of the Bloomsbury Group, 1910–1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pyl9DAAAQBAJ|year=2003|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-0-230-50512-4|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significant form===
Soon after Bell met [[Roger Fry]], he developed his art theory called "significant form". The two shared a passion for contemporary French art. Bell's book ''Art'' (1914) was the first publication of his theory, which he describes as "lines and colours combined in a particular way, certain forms, and relations of forms, that stir our aesthetic emotions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HFFAQAAMAAJ|title=Art|last=Bell|first=Clive|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|year=1916|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form can be seen in art created by many members of the Bloomsbury Group, an example being ''Interior at Gordon Square'' by Duncan Grant.

==Political views==
Bell was at one point an adherent of absolute pacifism, and during the [[First World War]] was a [[conscientious objector]], allowed to perform Work of National Importance by assisting on the farm of [[Philip Morrell]] [[Member of parliament|MP]], at Garsington Manor. In his 1938 pamphlet ''War Mongers'', he opposed any attempt by Britain to use military force, arguing "the worst tyranny is better than the best war."&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sellers, ''The Cambridge Companion to Virginia Woolf'' Cambridge University Press, 2010; {{ISBN|0521896940}}, (p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lj"&gt;Lawrence James, ''Warrior Race: A History of the British at War'', Hachette UK, 2010; {{ISBN|0748125353}} (p. 620).&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1940 Bell was a supporter of the British war effort, calling for a "ceaseless war against Hitler".&lt;ref name="lj"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1506">'''Cormac Mac Con Midhe''', a.k.a. '''Cormac mac Cearbhaill Mac Con Midhe''' (died 1627) was an early [[Modern Irish]] [[poet]].

[[Manuscript]] H.5.6, held at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], contains a [[poem]] of 24 [[stanza]]s apparently written by Mac Con Midhe for Toirealach Ó Néill of Sliocht Airt Óig of Tyrone and his wife, Sorcha. It survives in another copy of 188 lines in MS 1291 (formerly H.1.17), also in Trinity, both being made by Hugh O'Daly in the middle 18th century for a Dr. Sullivan. According to Ó Diobhlin (2000), "Because of the corruptness of the copy the poem has never been edited, nor have its contents been deciphered ... Toirealach was transplanted to Connacht, and then he disappears from history after the [[Jacobite rebellion]]."

[[File:Deer park, Powderham Castle - geograph.org.uk - 1416619.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Fallow deer]] in the park of [[Powderham Castle]], Devon]]

In [[Middle ages|medieval]] and [[Early Modern period|Early Modern]] [[Kingdom of England|England]], a '''deer park''' was an enclosed area containing deer. It was bounded by a ditch and bank with a wooden park [[Palisade|pale]] on top of the bank, or by a stone or brick wall.&lt;ref&gt;Dry stone wall at [[Dyrham Park]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ditch was on the inside&lt;ref name=Trees&amp;Woodland150&gt;{{cite book |last=Rackham |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Rackham |title=Trees and Woodland in the British Landscape |series=Archaeology in the Field Series |year=1976 |publisher=[[J. M. Dent]] &amp; Sons Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-460-04183-5 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing the effective height. Some parks had deer "leaps", where there was an external ramp and the inner ditch was constructed on a grander scale, thus allowing deer to enter the park but preventing them from leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The NEW Reading the Landscape|first=Richard|last=Muir|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=200|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some deer parks were established in the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon era]] and are mentioned in [[Anglo-Saxon Charters]]; these were often called hays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Sykes| first1 = Naomi  | editor-last=Liddiard  | editor-first=Robert  | year = 2007  | chapter = Animal Bones and Animal Parks | title = The Medieval Park: New Perspectives  |  publisher = Windgather Press  | location= Macclesfield, UK  | ISBN = 9781905119165 | page=60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] seized existing game reserves. Deer parks flourished and proliferated under the Normans,&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Deer Park |volume=7 |page=924}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming a forerunner of the deer parks that became popular among England's landed gentry. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 records thirty-six of them.

Initially the [[Norman dynasty|Norman kings]] maintained an exclusive right to keep and hunt deer and established [[Royal forest|forest law]] for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/forests/glossary.htm Forests and Chases of England and Wales: A Glossary.] St John's College, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; In due course they also allowed members of the nobility and senior clergy to maintain deer parks. At their peak at the turn of the 14th century, deer parks may have covered 2% of the land area of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Rackham| first1 = Oliver  | editor-last=  | editor-first= | year = 2003  | chapter = Wood-Pasture | title = The Illustrated History of the Countryside  |  publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicolson  | location= London, UK  | ISBN = 9780297843351 | page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James I of England|James I]] was an enthusiast for hunting but it became less fashionable and popular after the [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. The number of deer parks then declined, contemporary books documenting other more profitable uses for such an estate.&lt;ref&gt;An example is the planting for woods for firewood and shipbuilding in John Evelyn's ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber]]''&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th century many deer parks were landscaped, where deer then became optional within larger country parks, several of which were created or enlarged from wealth from trade and colonization in the [[British Empire]]. These later mostly gave way to profitable agriculture dependent on crop prices, with large parts of the workforce having been attracted elsewhere following increasing [[Industrial Revolution|industrialization]]. This created pressure to sell off parts or divide such estates while rural population growth pushed up poor law rates (particularly [[outdoor relief]] and the [[Labour Rate]]) and urban poverty led to the introduction of lump sum [[capital (economics)|capital taxation]] such as [[Inheritance Tax (United Kingdom)|inheritance tax]] and a shift in power away from the [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Estate Landscapes: Design, Improvements and Power in the Post-Medieval Landscape| editor1-last=Finch|editor1-first=Jonathan|editor2-last= Giles|editor2-first=Kate|year= 2007|publisher= Boydell and Brewer, Woodbridge and New York |pages=19–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deer parks are notable landscape features in their own right.  However, where they have survived into the 20th century, the lack of ploughing or development has often preserved other features within the park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beresford |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Beresford |title=History on the Ground |origyear=1957 |year=1998 |publisher=[[The History Press|Sutton Publishing]] |location= |isbn=0-7509-1884-5 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Tumulus|barrows (tumuli)]], [[Roman road]]s and [[abandoned village#United Kingdom|abandoned village]]s.

==Status==
To establish a deer park a royal licence was required, known as a "licence to empark"&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;—especially if the park was in or near a royal forest. Because of their cost and exclusivity, deer parks became status symbols. Deer were almost all kept within exclusive reserves with the larger ones often used as aristocratic playgrounds, for hunting, often with deer being driven into nets; and, there was no legitimate market for [[venison]] without an established provenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rackham |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Rackham |title=The History of the Countryside |origyear=1975 |year=1997|publisher=[[Phoenix Books|Phoenix Giant Paperback]] |location= |isbn= |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the ability to eat venison or give it to others was also a status symbol. Consequently, many deer parks were maintained for the supply of venison, rather than hunting the deer. Small deer parks which functioned primarily as household larders were attached to many smaller manors, such as at [[Umberleigh]] in Devon.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.) ''The Lisle Letters'', 6 vols., University of Chicago Press, Chicago &amp; London, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Owners would grant to their friends or to others to whom they owed a favour, a signed warrant for a specified number of deer, usually one only, specified as buck or doe, which the recipient would present to the park keeper who would select and kill one and hand the carcass to the grantee. The [[Lisle Papers]] dating from the 1530s contains many such letters from prospective grantees requesting such gifts from the park of [[Honor Grenville]], the lady of the manor of [[Umberleigh]] in Devon, and also contains reports to her from her [[bailiff]] listing grants of venison made from her park during the past year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Such grants acted as common features of the mediaeval social machinery.

==Licence to empark==
[[File:DyrhamLicence1511.jpg|thumb|200px|Royal licence to empark Dyrham granted by King Henry VIII to Sir [[William Denys]] (1470–1533), [[Esquire of the Body]], 5 June 1511. Appended is a rare perfect example of the Great Seal of Henry VIII. Collection of Dyrham Park, National Trust]]

King Henry VIII appointed Sir [[William Denys]] (1470–1533) an [[Esquire of the Body]] at some date before 5 June 1511. It was perhaps at the very time of William's appointment to that position at court that the King promised him the honour of a licence to empark 500 acres of his [[manor]] of [[Manor of Dyrham|Dyrham]] in Gloucestershire, which is to say to enclose the land with a wall or hedgebank and to establish a captive herd of deer within, with exclusive hunting rights. This grant is witnessed by a charter on parchment, to which is affixed a rare example of a perfect great seal of Henry VIII, now hanging in a frame beneath the main staircase of [[Dyrham Park]]. It clearly was handed down with the deeds of the manor on the termination of the Denys era at Dyrham. The charter is of exceptional interest as it is signed as witnesses by men of the greatest importance in the state, who were at the King's side at that moment, at the Palace of Westminster. The text of the document, translated from Latin is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Translation provided by information sheet by National Trust, at Dyrham Park; A summary of the charter was retained in the royal records, Charter Roll 200, no. 20, printed in ''Letters &amp; Papers of Henry VIII, Foreign &amp; Domestic, 1509–1514'', vol. 1, 5 June 1511, summarized as follows: "William Denys, Esquire for the Body, license by charter to impark 500 acres at Le Worthy within his manor of ''Dereham'' Gloucestershire &amp; to have [[Warren (free)|free-warren]] in all the [[demesne]]s of that manor.

Let it be known that we, motivated by our especial grace and certain knowledge of him, have granted for us and our heirs to our faithful servant William Denys, esquire of the Royal Body, to him, his heirs and assigns, the right to empark 500 acres of land, meadow, pasture and wood together with appurtenance at ''Le Worthy'' within the manor of ''Dereham'' in the county of Gloucestershire and enclose them with fences and hedges in order to make a park there. Also that they may have [[free warren]] in all their [[demesne]] lands within the said manor. No other person may enter this park or warren to hunt or catch anything which might belong to that park or warren without permission from William, his heirs or assigns under penalty of £10, provided that the land is not within our [[Royal forest|forest]].

{{wide image|Dyrham Park deer under trees, panorama.jpg|800px|The herd of fallow deer in 2009 in the park at [[Dyrham Park|Dyrham]], Gloucestershire, established in 1511}}

From the size of the present park it appears that only about 250 acres were ultimately enclosed. The grant of emparkment was separate from and in addition to the grant of [[free warren]] in his [[demesne]] lands. This latter allowed him to hunt exclusively on his unemparked other untenanted lands which were managed by his own staff. High dry-stone walls, typical of Gloucestershire, still survive around parts of the present parkland, which is still stocked with a herd of fallow deer. The park was thus an area in which Denys's deer would be at his own disposal and would be safe from being hunted or otherwise taken by any other person, including his neighbours and the king himself. The king when on royal progress throughout his kingdom was accompanied by an enormous entourage which needed daily feeding and entertainment, both of which functions were achieved by holding driven game shoots, in which an area of ground several miles in area would be surrounded and any deer within would be  driven towards a specified exit where the king and his favoured courtiers would be awaiting with bows and arrows to kill them. Thus several dozen if not hundreds of deer could be killed in a single day, to the impoverishment of the local countryside for several months if not years into the future.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Thus any landowner with a licensed park, even if within the circuit of such a drive, would be immune from the entry of such beaters into his park, and his deer would remain untouched.

Early historical records are replete with instances of noblemen breaking into each other's parks and killing deer therein, often as a result of a local territorial dispute or vendetta or merely from high spirits. The penalties inflicted by royal justice were severe in such instances. For example, in 1523 Sir William St Loe (d. 1556) of [[Sutton Court]], [[Chew Magna]], Somerset, together with 16 others, armed with bows and arrows, crossbows and swords, broke into Banwell Park in Somerset, attached to [[Banwell|Banwell Abbey]], a residence belonging to [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] [[William Barlow (bishop of Chichester)|William Barlow]], and killed 4 bucks and other deer. In the following August he made a similar raid and killed more than 20 deer, the heads of which he stuck on the boundary palings. He was ordered to appear before a magistrate, but the record of his punishment if any has not survived. However, after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] a short while later, in 1552 Sir William obtained for himself from the crown the office of Keeper of Banwell Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banwellhistory.org.uk/deerpark.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812201701/http://www.banwellhistory.org.uk/deerpark.html |date=12 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
Deer parks could vary in size from a circumference of many miles down to what amounted to little more than a deer paddock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ukeconet.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Ecology_economics_Sept_2007.pdf |format=PDF |author=Rotherham, I.D |date=2007 |title=The ecology and economics of medieval deer parks |journal=Landscape Archaeology and Ecology |volume=6 |pages=86–102 |accessdate=16 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730034358/http://www.ukeconet.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Ecology_economics_Sept_2007.pdf |archivedate=30 July 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape within a deer park was manipulated to produce a habitat that was both suitable for the deer and also provided space for hunting. "Tree dotted lawns, tree clumps and compact woods"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Muir |first=Richard |authorlink= |title=Be Your Own Landscape Detective: Investigating Where You Are |year=2007 |publisher=[[The History Press|Sutton Publishing]] |location= |isbn=0-7509-4333-5 |page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided "launds" (pasture)&lt;ref name=Trees&amp;Woodland146&gt;{{cite book |last=Rackham |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Rackham |title=Trees and Woodland in the British Landscape |series=Archaeology in the Field Series |year=1976 |publisher=[[J.

The landscape was intended to be visually attractive as well as functional.

==Identifying former deer parks==
[[William George Hoskins|W. G. Hoskins]] remarked that "the reconstruction of medieval parks and their boundaries is one of the many useful tasks awaiting the field-worker with patience and a good local knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoskins |first=W.

A few deer parks in areas with plentiful building stone had stone walls instead of a park pale.&lt;ref name=Trees&amp;Woodland144/&gt; Examples include [[Barnsdale]] in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Burghley House|Burghley]] on the [[Cambridgeshire]]/[[Lincolnshire]] border.&lt;ref name=Trees&amp;Woodland144/&gt;

Where the deer park reverted to agriculture, the newly established [[field system]] was often rectilinear, clearly contrasting with the system outside the park.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23868">The '''Dove Campaign for Real Beauty''' is a worldwide [[marketing campaign]] launched by [[Unilever]] in 2004 that includes advertisements, video, workshops, sleepover events and the publication of a book and the production of a play. The aim of the campaign is to celebrate the natural physical variation embodied by all women and inspire them to have the confidence to be comfortable with themselves.&lt;ref name="Why"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816112659/http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.ca/supports.asp?url=supports.asp&amp;section=campaign&amp;id=1560 |archivedate=August 16, 2007 |title=Why the Campaign for Real Beauty? |year=2006 |publisher=Unilever Canada |url=http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.ca/supports.asp?url=supports.asp&amp;section=campaign&amp;id=1560|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dove's partners in the effort include such marketing and communications agencies as Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Edelman Public Relations, and Harbinger Communications (in Canada) along with other specialized consultants.&lt;ref name="Cannes"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Dove Evolution Viral Film wins Film Grand Prix at Cannes Advertising Awards |publisher=Harbinger |date=June 23, 2007 |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/94667/dove-evolution-viral-film-wins-film-grand-prix-at-cannes-advertising-awards |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the overall project was the [[Evolution (advertisement)|"Evolution"]] campaign.

==Campaign==
In 2004, Dove and [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]] organized a photography exhibit titled "Beyond Compare: Women Photographers on Real Beauty."  The show featured work from 67 female photographers and was the beginning of the conversation on beauty that would lead to the Real Beauty campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/21/dove-real-beauty-campaign-turns-10_n_4575940.html|title=Dove 'Real Beauty' Campaign Turns 10: How A Brand Tried To Change The Conversation About Female Beauty|last=Bahadur|first=Nina|date=2014-01-21|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dove Real Beauty campaign was conceived in 2004 during a 3-year creative strategic research effort, conducted in partnership with three universities in four cities around the world, led by [[Joah Santos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/connect/media-and-technology/intelligent-women-portrayed-more-in-ads/|title='Why are we not seeing intelligent women portrayed more in ads?'|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creative was conceived by [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]] Düsseldorf and London.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;&lt;ref name="AdAge"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Advertising Age|authorlink1=Advertising Age|title=Top 15 Ad Campaigns of the 21st Century|url=http://adage.com/lp/top15/#truth|website=AdAge.com|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|accessdate=10 September 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research created a new advertising strategy, which Joah Santos named (iconic Point Of View) P.O.V. - Purpose | Ownership | Vision.&lt;ref name=TEDtalks&gt;{{cite news|title=Become significant|date=May 23, 2007|work=TEDtalks|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta5DQKseliU|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new strategy led to all top 5 Campaigns of the Century, as rated by [[Advertising Age]].&lt;ref name=AdAge/&gt; The strategy discarded the brand essence ladder typically used by Unilever and called for a POV strategy "To make women feel comfortable in the skin they are in, to create a world where beauty is a source of confidence and not anxiety." All campaigns for Dove Real Beauty need then to follow the POV set forth, each with their own insight. The initial campaign insight/tension was an indication that only 2% of women consider themselves beautiful.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Ad About Women’s Self-Image Creates a Sensation|author=Tanzina Vega|date=April 18, 2013|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/business/media/dove-ad-on-womens-self-image-creates-an-online-sensation.html|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was created by [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]] Düsseldorf and London.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt;  
 
The first stage of the campaign centered on a series of [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] advertisements, initially put up in Germany and [[United Kingdom]], and later worldwide. The spots showcased photographs of regular women (in place of professional models), taken by noted portrait photographer Rankin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/02-08-2007/0004523308&amp;EDATE|title= Too Young To Be Old: Dove Pro-Age|accessdate=2008-02-21 |author= |year=2004 |work=([[press release]]) |publisher=[[Unilever plc]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ads invited passers-by to vote on whether a particular model was, for example, "Fat or Fab" or "Wrinkled or Wonderful", with the results of the votes dynamically updated and displayed on the billboard itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_Oct_22/ai_n6248505 |title= First Interactive Times Square Billboard Asks New Yorkers to Vote; Global Beauty Brand Dove Asks: 'Do You Think Our Advertising Is Beautiful?' (on FindArticles.com)|accessdate=2008-02-21 |date=2004-10-22 |work=[[Business Wire]] |publisher=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanying the billboard advertisements was the publication of the "Dove Report", a corporate study which Unilever intended to "[create] a new definition of beauty [which] will free women from self-doubt and encourage them to embrace their real beauty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.com/uploadedFiles/challenging_beauty.pdf |title=The Dove Report: Challenging Beauty |accessdate=2008-02-21 |format=PDF |year=2004 |publisher=[[Unilever plc]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920165955/http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.com/uploadedFiles/challenging_beauty.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-20 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series received significant media coverage from [[talk show]]s, [[List of women's magazines|women's magazines]], and mainstream news broadcasts and publications,&lt;ref name="media"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://creativity-online.com/?action=news:article&amp;newsId=119085&amp;sectionId=the_creativity_awards |date=14 May 2007 |title=2007 Creativity Award Grand Prize Winner: Dove "Evolution"  |publisher=''Creativity'' |accessdate=November 28, 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; generating media exposure which Unilever has estimated to be worth more than 30&amp;nbsp;times the paid-for media space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Major Marketing Campaigns, Vol 2 |chapter=Unilever PLC: ''Campaign for Real Beauty'' campaign |last=Kolstad |first=Jonathan |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=Thomson Gale  |isbn=978-0-7876-7356-7 |pages=1679–1683 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this success, the campaign expanded into other media, with a series of television spots (''Flip Your Wigs'' and the ''Pro-Age'' series, among others) and print advertisements ("Tested on Real Curves"), culminating in the 2006 ''[[Little Girls (Dove)|Little Girls]]'' global campaign, which featured regional versions of the same advertisement in both print and screen,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adforum.com/creative-work/ad/player/59325 U.S.] and [https://archive.is/20070205070648/http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.ph/flat3.asp?id=7109 Filipino] versions, for example.&lt;/ref&gt; for which Unilever purchased a 30-second spot in the commercial break during [[Super Bowl XL]] at an estimated cost of US$2.5M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingvox.com/archives/2006/10/31/dove_evolution_goes_viral_with_triple_the_traffic_of_super_bowl_spot/ |title='Dove Evolution' Goes Viral, with Triple the Traffic of Super Bowl Spot |accessdate=2008-02-21 |work=Marketing Vox |date=2006-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517231034/http://www.marketingvox.com/archives/2006/10/31/dove_evolution_goes_viral_with_triple_the_traffic_of_super_bowl_spot/ |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Ogilvy &amp; Mather were seeking to extend the campaign further, by creating one or more [[viral video]]s to host on the Campaign for Real Beauty website. The first of these, ''[[Daughters (Dove)|Daughters]],'' was an interview-style piece intended to show how mothers and daughters related to issues surrounding the modern perception of beauty and the beauty industry. The film, ''Daughters'', touches upon the self-esteem issues found in many young girls today. Dove's Self-Esteem Fund supports their campaign by using statistics that demonstrate how young women and girls are more apt to have distorted views of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The American Beauty Industry Encyclopedia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CljLw4sH2DMC|publisher = ABC-CLIO|date = 2010-01-01|isbn = 9780313359491|language = en|first = Julie A.|last = Willett}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the production of ''Daughters'' that a series of short films entitled "Beauty Crackdown" was pitched to Unilever as an "activation idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beam.tv/beamreels/reel_player.php?CdRryqFbSH |title= Making Of: ''Evolution''|accessdate=2008-02-21|work=Rogue Editorial}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idea"&gt;{{cite web |last=McKenzie |first=Brett |url=http://ihaveanidea.org/articles/index.php?/archives/381-The-Evolution-of-Evolution.html |title= The Evolution of ''Evolution'' (interview with Tim Piper and Janet Kestin)|accessdate=2008-02-21|publisher=ihaveanidea.org}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was one that [[art director]] Tim Piper, who proposed to create ''[[Evolution (advertisement)|Evolution]]'' with the budget left over from ''Daughters'' (C$135,000&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sarah |last=Scott |title=Ready for their Close-Up |url=http://www.canada.com/national/nationalpost/story.html?id=e2e95710-bd0a-46c5-8208-725975e9ec88 |work=[[Financial Post]] |date=September 4, 2007 |accessdate=November 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417124231/http://www2.canada.com/national/nationalpost/story.html?id=e2e95710-bd0a-46c5-8208-725975e9ec88 |archivedate=April 17, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), pushed. It was originally intended to get people to the Campaign for Real Beauty website to see ''Daughters'', and to participate in the workshops featured on the site.&lt;ref name="idea"/&gt;  After ''Evolution'', Ogilvy produced ''[[Onslaught (Dove)|Onslaught]]'' and ''[[Amy (Dove)|Amy]]''.

In April 2013, a video titled ''[[Dove Real Beauty Sketches]]'' was released as part of the campaign, created by Hugo Veiga.  It went [[viral video|viral]] attracting strong reactions from the public and media.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt; In the video, several women describe themselves to a [[forensic sketch]] artist who cannot see his subjects.  The same women are then described by strangers whom they met the previous day.  The sketches are compared, with the stranger's image invariably being both more flattering and more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dove's 'Real Beauty Sketches' Ad Campaign Tells Women 'You're More Beautiful Than You Think'|work=Huffington Post|author=Emma Gray|date=April 16, 2013|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/15/doves-real-beauty-sketches-ad-campaign-video_n_3088071.html|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The differences create strong reactions when shown to the women.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt;

In October 2013, ''[[Free Being Me]]'', a collaboration between Dove and the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] was launched, with the aim of increasing "self-esteem and body confidence" in girls.&lt;ref name="WAGGS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wagggsworld.org/en/grab/24564/1/dove.pdf |title=PRESS RELEASE |publisher=[[WAGGS]] |date=11 October 2013 |accessdate=3 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110848/http://wagggsworld.org/en/grab/24564/1/dove.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Dove and Ogilvy London created limited-edition versions of body wash bottles meant to look like different body shapes and sizes.  Dove produced 6,800 bottles of the six different designs and sent them to 15 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://creativity-online.com/work/dove-real-beauty-bottles/51698|title=Dove Restyles Its Body Wash Bottles as 'Real' Body Shapes - Print (video) - Creativity Online|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
Individual ads caused different reactions, some positive and some negative. ''Evolution'' won two [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival|Cannes Lions]] Grand Prix awards.&lt;ref name="Cannes"/&gt;  Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Katy Young called ''Real Beauty Sketches'' "[Dove's] most thought provoking film yet&amp;nbsp;... Moving, eye opening and in some ways saddening, this is one campaign that will make you think, and hopefully, feel more beautiful."&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Dove's new beauty campaign confirms that we are more beautiful than we think|date=April 22, 2013|author=Katy Young|work=The Telegraph|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/news-features/TMG10009657/Doves-new-beauty-campaign-confirms-that-we-are-more-beautiful-than-we-think.html|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign has been criticized on the grounds that Unilever also produces Fair and Lovely, a skin-lightening product marketed at dark-skinned women in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jann Bernadette |last1=Lee |date=Winter 2008 |title=Selling Self-Esteem |journal=McClung's Magazine |url=http://issuu.com/McClungs/docs/winter2008/18 |pages=18–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also widely noted that Unilever brand Lynx's advertising campaign would seemingly contradict the sentiment of the Campaign for Real Beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nutley |first=Michael |url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/loose-lips-place-brand-reputation-on-the-line/3008931.article |title=Loose lips place brand reputation on the line |work=Marketing Week |date=January 21, 2010 |accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Unilever owns [[Axe (brand)|Axe]] hygiene products, which are marketed to men using overtly sexualized women, and [[Slim Fast]] diet bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Daniel |last=O'Donnell |year=2008 |title=Unilever's Dove and Axe: Examples of Hypocrisy or Good Marketing? |url=http://awpagesociety.com/images/uploads/08CaseStudy_Journal.pdf |journal=Case Study Competition |publisher=Arthur W.

But more to the point, does Dove’s idea mean teen boys don’t still want to smell good for the ladies? Or that people who are overweight don’t want to lose a few pounds? These are different brands solving problems for completely different audiences."&lt;ref name=Burns /&gt; The criticism has also been justified from others that state their concerns that the images that Dove portrays in their ads are supposed to be unedited and "real"; however, there have been comments made stating they have been photoshopped to smooth the appearance of the women's skin, hide wrinkles and blemishes, fix stray hairs, etc. Photo retoucher Pascal Dangin, who works for Box Studios in New York, told ''The New Yorker'' he made edits to the photos, “Do you know how much retouching was on that?” he asked. “But it was great to do, a challenge, to keep everyone’s skin and faces showing the mileage but not looking unattractive.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dove’s ‘Real Beauty’ Campaign Isn't Real!|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2008/05/doves_real_beauty_campaign_isn_1.html|work=Dove’s ‘Real Beauty’ Campaign Isn't Real!|publisher=NYMag|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women who are targeted by these ads have mixed reviews as well. Some women were turned off that Dove was in essence telling them they knew the insecurities they felt and what all women felt. Social networking sites such as Facebook became an outlet for women to express their praise and criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stampler|first=Laura|title=Why People Hate Dove's 'Real Beauty Sketches' Video|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-people-hate-doves-real-beauty-ad-2013-4|work=Why People Hate Dove's 'Real Beauty Sketches' Video|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign has been criticized positively and negatively by consumers, critiques, and other companies because of the way Dove has chosen to portray their messages for their audience. Writing for ''The New York Times'', Tanzina Vega produced the article ''“ Ad About Women’s Self-Image Creates a Sensation''”. In this piece it portrayed how different people viewed the Dove Real Beauty Campaign in different ways. First, was “Brenda Fiala, a senior vice president for strategy at Blast Radius, a digital advertising agency. Fiala stated that Dove was trying to create a sense of trust with the consumer by tapping into deep-seated emotions that many women feel about themselves and their appearance”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/business/media/dove-ad-on-womens-self-image-creates-an-online-sensation.html?_r=0|title = Ad About Women's Self Image Creates a Sensation|date = April 18, 2013|accessdate = |website = The New York Times|publisher = |last = Vega|first = Tanzina}}&lt;/ref&gt; What she also believed for [[Dove Real Beauty Campaign|The Dove Real Beauty Campaign]] was that the campaign “hits on a real human truth for women,”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and that,“Many women undervalue themselves and also the way they look".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On the other hand in this same ad it states that some people criticized the Ad’s for the campaign believing they were contradicting with their true message. In the article by Vega; Jazz Brice, 24 a viewer of the campaign, explains during an interview how she took the messages from the Dove Real Beauty Campaign “I think it makes people much more susceptible to absorbing the subconscious messages, and that at the heart of it all is that beauty is still what defines women. It is a little hypocritical".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The campaign has had an impact worldwide in both positive and negative ways with the help of [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove’s]] social media outlets such as; Facebook and Twitter. The Dove Campaign was one of the first campaigns to be considered as going "viral" in the sense that to be viral was new and generally unknown at the time of the beginning of the campaign (2004).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some viewers received the message as a positive impact to the way women were viewed while other viewed it as the opposite.

With the positive and negative feedback received from the viewers and consumers of the campaign the Dove Company did not just want to “talk”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/21/dove-real-beauty-campaign-turns-10_n_4575940.html|title = Dove 'Real Beauty' Campaign Turns 10: How A Brand Tried To Change The Conversation About Female Beauty|date = 2014-01-21|accessdate = |website = Huff Post Women|publisher = |last = Bahadur|first = Nina}}&lt;/ref&gt; to media about the problem they wanted to “act” &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; on the issues and embrace the  advantages of the campaign for the future. In the article, ''“Dove’ Real Beauty Campaign Turns 10: How a Brand Tried To Change The Conversation About Female Beauty”'', written by Nina Bahadur from the HuffPost interviewed a spokesperson for the Dove Company about the types of feed back they have got from the Dove Real Beauty Campaign and how it has impacted the company. Sharon MacLeod, vice president of Unilever North America Personal Care, told [[The Huffington Post|HuffPost]]"[We were thinking], we have to walk the talk” she also stated  “We can't just be getting people stirred up; awareness and conversation isn't enough. We actually have to do something to change what's happening.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since the start of the campaign, Dove has started funds for women and girls to promote their message along with more advertisings in attempt to bring more awareness to women of different ages and cultural background. The company of Dove believes they still have a chance to bring a greater impact on society and the generations to come when it comes to the impact of societies views of beauty and the impact it has on women and young girls.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As stated in the interview with MacLeod "We're going to try to change a generation," MacLeod tells [[The Huffington Post|HuffPost]]”You have to wait until they grow up to see what happens.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some critiques on the other hand believe that the campaign focuses to greatly on the physical aspect of beauty instead of other areas that should have more focus. From The Cut, Ann Friedman states the following about the Dove Real Beauty Campaign: “These ads still uphold the notion that, when it comes to evaluating ourselves and other women, beauty is paramount. The goal shouldn’t be to get women to focus on how we are all gorgeous in our own way. It should be to get women to do for ourselves what we wish the broader culture would do: judge each other based on intelligence and wit and ethical sensibility, not just our faces and bodies.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/04/beauty-above-all-else-doves-viral-ad-problem.html|title = Beauty Above All Else: The Problem With Dove’s New Viral Ad|date = April 18, 2013|accessdate = |website = The Cut|publisher = |last = Friedman|first = Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics and defenders of the Dove Real Beauty Campaign have both pointed out on occasion that because just cause Dove is trying to redefine what society and women believe as beauty does not essentially mean that women and younger girls will feel different about themselves, this is also stated by Ann Friedman when she suggests to the [[The Huffington Post|HuffPost]] as evidence that Dove's message about beauty is important and necessary. An estimated 80 percent of American women feel dissatisfied with their bodies, and 81 percent of 10-year-old girls are afraid of becoming "fat." Can a series of ad campaigns really change institutionalized body hatred?&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Contrasting campaigns==
Contrary to the Dove Campaign for Real Beauty is the [[Victoria's Secret]] campaign entitled 'The Perfect Body' featuring only fit, lean women. Sources have said the campaign will ultimately lower a woman's self-esteem, rather than enhance it such that Dove's did. Additionally, VS's campaign did not include many women of different skin tones. In comparison, Dove's campaign features women of several ethnic backgrounds which it makes it much more relatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bahadur|first1=Nina|title=Victoria's Secret 'Perfect Body' Campaign Changes Slogan After Backlash|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/06/victorias-secret-perfect-body-campaign_n_6115728.html|website=Huffington Post|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Elgar Society''' was founded in 1951 and was registered as a [[charitable organization|charity]] on 22 January 1988. The society seeks to promote performance of [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]’s [[music]], especially the more rarely performed items.  It is particularly concerned with introducing the composer and his music to younger audiences and, by making grants to appropriate educational activities, to enhance the quality of life of members of the public.  It also supports the [[Elgar Birthplace Museum]] with an annual grant with the objective of widening accessibility to the location and its contents and encouraging research.

The society publishes a [[Academic journal|journal]] three times a year, which contains the results of Elgar research and is sold to educational institutions and the general public as well as being sent to members as part of their subscription benefit.  There is also a thrice-yearly [[newsletter]] sent to members only.

The president of the Elgar society is [[Julian Lloyd Webber]]. Previous presidents were [[Sir Adrian Boult]] from 1951, [[Yehudi Menuhin|Lord Menuhin]] from 1983 and [[Richard Hickox]] from 1999.

== Branches ==
There are seven UK Branches organised geographically: Great Western, London, North West, Scotland, Southern, Thames Valley and West Midlands; and a branch in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada.  The creation of a Branch is at the discretion of the Society’s Council and requires substantive evidence from a sufficiently large group of members that there is a reasonable assurance of viability.  Branches are required to report periodically to the Council on their activities and submit their annual accounts to the Treasurer.

== Elgar Medal ==

Before 2011, The Elgar Medal was awarded only to foreign scholars and musicians who publish or perform, and therefore promote, Elgar’s music abroad.  During a concert in [[Birmingham Symphony Hall|Birmingham’s Symphony Hall]] on 11 December 2008, Steven Halls, Chairman of the Society, presented the medal to [[Sakari Oramo]].  The remaining outstanding award, to [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]], presented in 2010. However, in February 2011, the Elgar Medal was presented to [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]], CBE, a renowned British journalist, writer, and music critic, for his major contribution to promoting the works of Elgar.

'''''Enclave''''' ({{lang-sr|Енклава}} / '''''Enklava''''') is a 2015 German-Serbian co-produced [[drama film]] directed by [[Goran Radovanović]].&lt;ref name="IndieWire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/sydneylevine/35-films-that-could-become-foreign-language-oscar-submissions-20150826 |title=35 Films That Could Become Foreign Language Oscar Submissions |accessdate=3 September 2015 |work=Indie Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of six films shortlisted by Serbia to be their submission for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[88th Academy Awards]] but it was not nominated.&lt;ref name="Shortlist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/kultura/vesti.php?nav_category=268&amp;yyyy=2015&amp;mm=08&amp;dd=14&amp;nav_id=1027025 |title=Filmovi u konkurenciji za domaćeg kandidata za Oskara |work=B92|date=14 August 2015 |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September 2015 it was selected to represent Serbia for the Foreign Language Oscar.&lt;ref name="Serbia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vijesti.me/caffe/enklava-srpski-kandidat-za-oskara-849736 |title="Enklava" - srpski kandidat za Oskara |work=Vijesti |date=3 September 2015 |accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HWR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-serbia-selects-enclave-foreign-820400 |title=Oscars: Serbia Selects 'Enclave' for Foreign-Language Category |last=Holdsworth |first=Nick |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=4 September 2015 |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main theme of the film is life of [[Kosovo Serbs]] in small isolated [[Kosovo Serb enclaves|ethnic enclaves]].&lt;ref name="balkaninsight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/film-on-kosovo-serbs-in-bid-for-oscar-09-04-2015 |title=Film on Plight of Kosovo Serbs Bids for Oscar |work=Balkan Insight |date=7 September 2015 |accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film follows a young Serbian boy named Nenad, who was living in a ghetto that was the product of a previous war. Rather than having a linear plot line, the film focuses on the different unfortunate events in Nenad's life, sometimes revisiting past events. Specifically, the events are:
* Nenad is driven to school each day in an armoured car. This is due to the discrimination against him by everyone not living in his enclave. There is only one teacher at his school and he is also the only student. However, his teacher later leaves the war-torn place, and his school trips end.
* Nenad witnesses his grandfather die.
* Nenad gets mixed up with some bad friends. After swimming with them, his clothes fall into the river and are lost. As a result he is whipped by his father.
* A man attempts to steal Nenad's father's cattle and Nenad's father attempts to shoot him. The police arrive and arrest Nenad's father and confiscate all of his illegally owned weapons, which were kept in a box under his bed. The police offer Nenad's father a chance at employment at the police station, but he turns it down.
* Nenad's hostile friends trap him under a giant bell for refusing to play a game, and the leading boy (Baskim) pulls out a pistol and shoots the bell. This causes the bullet to ricochet and hit Baskim.
* Baskim's family questions him about who shot him. Baskim responds, "A Serb." Baskim's family and their gang set the Serbian enclave on fire, trapping Nenad under the bell tower. The heat and smoke nearly suffocates Nenad. Baskim feels guilt for trapping Nenad and revisits the bell where Nenad is trapped.
* Nenad's family decides they want a new life and end up moving to [[Belgrade]] after they free Nenad from under the bell. Nenad is not used to a school with many people and as a result he does not perform well socially.

==Cast==
* [[Filip Subarić]] as Nenad
* [[Denis Murić]] as Baskim
* [[Nebojša Glogovac]] as Vojislav Arsic
* [[Anica Dobra]] as Milica Arsic
* [[Miodrag Krivokapić (actor)|Miodrag Krivokapić]] as Otac Draža

A '''fly crew''' is a group of people who operate a [[fly system]] from its locking rail during a theatrical production. The responsibilities of a fly crew include bringing [[batten (theater)|battens]] in and out, keeping the fly system linesets in balance, and ensuring that the fly system's [[rope lock]]s are applied when the associated linesets are not moving. Each member of the crew is called a ''flyman''. Large venues will often have several flymen on their fly crews, as well as a [[fly captain]] to manage the crew and plan cues for the fly system.  

During a show, predefined cues may require flymen to operate the fly system at high speeds and with great precision. The scenery used in shows typically weigh up to one ton per batten {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and may be flown in at speeds approaching 30 miles per hour {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and stopped at stage level without hitting the deck. Consequently, the skills of a flyman may take years to master, and flying is often considered an art form in its own right. ''Loaders'' are flymen who work high above the stage in the grid, adding or removing counterweights from the fly system arbors.

==Safety==
The job is often dangerous and carries a high degree of risk due to the large amount of weight and great heights involved. A run-away line, for example, might injure the operator or others in the way of the moving equipment, and a counterweight dropped from the grid could kill or injure a person standing below. When the crew adds or removes counterweights they are often working at heights of six stories or more in the area above a stage known as a [[fly loft]], or grid. Consequently, [[safety harness]]es may be used to protect fly crew members or loaders. Harnesses are not perfect, however, and serious injury can still result should the falling person swing into nearby objects.

==History==
Historically, off-duty [[sailor]]s were used as fly crews in theaters because they had comprehensive knowledge of [[knot]]s and [[rope]]s due to their experience with [[sail]]s. They communicated with one another using high-pitched whistles. Because of this, whistling was not allowed in theaters to prevent it from accidentally being interpreted as a flyrail command. It is still considered 'bad luck' to whistle in a theater.

==Context==

This article uses terms common in the USA.  Different vocabulary may be used in other English-speaking countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1901">In [[folkloristics]], '''folk belief''' or '''folk-belief''' is a broad genre of [[folklore]]. This category includes a wide variety of behaviors, expressions, and beliefs. Examples of concepts included in this genre are [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[popular belief]], [[folk religion]], [[planting signs]], [[hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]], [[conjuration]], [[Spell (paranormal)|charms]], [[root work]], [[taboos]], [[old wives' tale]]s, [[omens]], [[portents]], the [[supernatural]] and [[folk medicine]].&lt;ref name="GREEN-89"&gt;Green (1997:89).&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk belief and associated behaviors are strongly evidenced among all elements of society, regardless of education level or income. In turn, folk belief is found in an agricultural, suburban, and urban environments alike.&lt;ref name="GREEN-97"&gt;Green (1997:97).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
One of a variety of compounds extending from the coinage of the term ''[[folklore]]'' in 1846 (previously ''popular antiquities''), the term ''folk-belief'' is first evidenced in use by British folklorist [[Laurence Gomme]] in 1892.&lt;ref name="OED-folk-belief"&gt;"folk, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 3 November 2016. See also "folklore, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 3 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common parlance employs the word ''[[superstition]]'' for what folklorists generally refer to as ''folk belief''.&lt;ref name="GEORGES-JONES-1995-122"&gt;For example, see discussion in Georges &amp; Jones (1995:122).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Television ===

==== ''Mock the Week'' (2005–2009) ====
{{Main|Mock the Week}}
Boyle was a regular on the BBC panel show ''[[Mock the Week]]'' from its first episode on 5 June 2005 until 17 September 2009. A show in which the panel comment humorously on various news stories from the [[Media of the United Kingdom|British media]], ''Mock the Week'' is hosted by [[Dara Ó Briain]], who in an episode of ''Live at the Apollo'' referred to Boyle as "the dark heart of ''Mock the Week''."&lt;ref name="boyletimesonline"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/comedy/article5037516.ece |title=Is Frankie Boyle the UK's most shocking comic? |publisher=Times Online |date=1 November 2008 |accessdate=28 May 2015 | location=London | first=Stephen | last=Dalton | deadurl=yes | archivedate=15 June 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615134953/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/comedy/article5037516.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his [[black comedy|morbid sense of humour]], which plays on negative images of celebrities, politicians, and society (particularly his home country of Scotland). On 2 October 2009, Boyle announced via the ''Mock the Week''{{'}}s Facebook fan page that he was leaving the show to concentrate on other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/8287297.stm |title=Boyle leaves Mock The Week panel, BBC, 2 October 2009 |publisher=BBC News |date=2 October 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle has since criticised both the show's production team and the [[BBC Trust]]. He claims that the show did not cover enough major news stories, and was too restrictive on his risqué comedy act because the producers and the BBC Trust were afraid of "frightening the horses".&lt;ref name="MSN"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Frankie Boyle slams Mock The Week |url=http://tv.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=150480748&amp;GT1=61503 |work=uk.msn |date=27 October 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is seen in archive footage of ''Mock the Week'' on the 2009 Christmas Special, which aired on 22 December 2009, as a series of "Best Bits and Festive Clips", in a compilation celebrating the show's 100th episode on 5 July 2012 as well as in archive footage on the 2012 Christmas Special, which aired on 27 December 2012.

==== ''Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights'' (2010) ====
{{Main|Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights}}
In October 2009, Boyle piloted a sketch and stand-up show for [[Channel 4]], entitled ''Deal with This, Retards'' to be produced by RDF Scotland subsidiary the [[Comedy Unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker |first=Robin |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/broadcasters/bbc/boyle-quits-mock-the-week/5006386.article |title=Broadcast Now, 2 October 2009 |publisher=Broadcastnow.co.uk |date=2 October 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle mentioned on ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' that the original title of the show had been dropped, due to its offensive nature, and been renamed ''[[Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights|Tramadol Nights]]'' and aired from the end of November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a259760/frankie-boyle-dismisses-comedy-controversy.html|title=Frankie Boyle dismisses comedy controversy|author=Mayer Nissim|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official page launched via Channel 4's official website, which confirmed that the show's full name is ''Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights'' and the series was made up of six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/frankie-boyles-tramadol-nights |title=Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights |publisher=Channel 4 |date=29 December 2010 |accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle caused controversy on the show with his comments about [[Katie Price]] and [[Dwight Yorke]]'s disabled son Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0028/46729/obb179.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Frankie Boyle's Rehabilitation Programme'' pilot (2011) ====

On 21 August 2011, it was revealed that Channel 4 had given Boyle permission to record a pilot for a topical talk show in October of that year, which would be called ''Frankie Boyle's Rehabilitation Programme'' (despite the controversy surrounding ''Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights''). Channel 4 head of comedy Shane Allen told the press that "it's very much like ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' or ''[[Wogan]]'', but with paedo jokes" and that the show would feature Frankie "in a studio, riffing off the audience a bit with some people challenging what he says".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/aug/21/frankie-boyle-pilot-channel-4 |title=Channel 4 line up return for Frankie Boyle |publisher=The Guardian |date=21 August 2011 |accessdate=17 June 2012 |location=London |first=Patrick |last=Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''The Boyle Variety Performance'' (2012) ====
''The Boyle Variety Performance'' was broadcast on 19 August 2012 and featured Boyle with guests [[Rob Delaney (comedian)|Rob Delaney]], [[Nick Helm]], [[Katherine Ryan]] and [[Tom Stade]]. A few days after the show was broadcast, Boyle attracted criticism after he posted jokes on Twitter about the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/31/frankie-boyle-paralympics-twitter-jokes?newsfeed=true |title=Frankie Boyle Paralympics Twitter jokes prove last straw for Channel 4 |publisher=The Guardian |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2012 |location=London |first=Josh |last=Halliday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Gasping'' (2014) ====
In 2014, Frankie Boyle starred in the short comedy film ''Gasping'' for BBC Scotland, written by [[Greg Hemphill]]. The title refers to an expression in [[Scottish English]], communicative of an irresistible compulsion to do something, such as smoke a cigarette; or, as here, to drink alcohol. The short feature, an at-times-farcical but generally deadpan treatment of a man's attempted recovery from alcoholism.

==== ''Frankie Boyle's Autopsy Series'' (2014–2016) ====
''Frankie Boyle's Referendum Autopsy'' was released on 28 September 2014, and ''Frankie Boyle's Election Autopsy'' was released on 17 May 2015, through [[BBC iPlayer]]. Featuring guests Katherine Ryan and [[Sara Pascoe]], Boyle dissected the [[Scottish independence referendum]], 2014 and [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/20/frankie-boyle-bbc-election-autopsy-comedy-iplayer|title=Frankie Boyle’s Election Autopsy is too hot for TV – so much the better|last=Logan|first=Brian|date=20 May 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Frankie Boyle's American Autopsy'' dissected the buildup and fallout of the United States presidential election, tackling topics such as feminism, entertainment, propaganda, and guns. Special guests include Sara Pascoe, Katherine Ryan, [[Michelle Wolf]], Desiree Burch, and [[Richard Osman]].

==== ''Frankie Boyle's New World Order'' (2017–present) ====
A show similar to his BBC iPlayer exclusive "autopsy" shows, Boyle returned to TV on [[BBC Two]], with his ''[[Frankie Boyle's New World Order]]'', which follows a very similar structure to the aforementioned programmes, where Frankie makes two statements, and discusses them with his guests. The difference is that the studio audience do not vote on if they agree with that statement. The show premiered on 8 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-05-25/bbc2-to-broadcast-new-frankie-boyle-satirical-show-right-after-general-election-polls-close|title=Frankie Boyle' new BBC political comedy to air right after UK Election 2017 polls close|last=Dowell|first=Ben|date=25 May 2017|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle comments on his material throughout and often informs the audience that certain jokes are not going into the show due to their reaction (or lack thereof), and the podcast carries an explicit content warning. The recording includes some audience interaction, with Boyle offering to test some of his new "put-downs" on the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast | url=https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=323684930 | title=Mock The Week Musings | website=[[iTunes]] | publisher=BBC | host=Frankie Boyle | date=16 July 2009 | accessdate =24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2013 and 2015, Boyle, along with Canadian comedian [[Glenn Wool]] hosted a number of editions of a podcast known as Freestyle, which involved Boyle and Wool speaking about topical and controversial news stories, including [[Madeleine McCann]], [[Bill Cosby]], and obscure takes on popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast | title=Freestyle |url=http://frankieboyle.podbean.com/ |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comic book ===
In September 2010, Boyle began publishing his comic strip ''Rex Royd'' in the launch issue of ''[[CLiNT]]'' magazine, co-written with comedian Jim Muir and with artwork by Michael Dowling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=37302 |title=CLINT WEEK: COMEDIAN FRANKIE BOYLE ROCKS "REX ROYD" |publisher=CBR |date=2 March 2012 |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story follows a [[Lex Luthor]]-style newspaper magnate with a super-villain alter-ego. Initially, the strip ran for first four issues of ''CLiNT''. The strip resumed again in November 2011, until the final issue in August 2013, when publisher [[Titan Magazines|Titan]] announced that ''CLiNT'' was ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=47315 |title=Comicbookresources.com |publisher=Comicbookresources.com |date=14 August 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other appearances ===
Boyle appeared as himself in the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned]]'' (2009), in a stand-up routine at Liberty City's Split Sides Comedy Club. He appeared on Real Radio Wales's weekly comedy show ''Comedy Nighthorse'' on 19 October 2011. Boyle writes satire and opinion pieces for the British newspaper [[The Guardian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/frankie-boyle|title=Frankie Boyle|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Boyle has regularly been involved in public controversies due to the acerbic nature of his humour.

=== Rebecca Adlington ===
Boyle managed to attract criticism in August 2008 when complaints were received about comments he made regarding British Olympic swimmer [[Rebecca Adlington]] on ''Mock the Week'', saying that she "looks like someone who's looking at themselves in the back of a [[spoon]]". The BBC ruled that the jokes were indeed "humiliating" and "risked offending the audience", while also calling Boyle "a brilliant member of the team".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8314495.stm |title='Mock' rapped over swimmer jibes |publisher=BBC |date=19 October 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Adlington's agent said that simply admitting mistakes was not enough, saying: "By giving Frankie Boyle a rebuke they fail to discourage others from doing the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8337421.stm |title=Swimmer queries Mock show ruling |publisher=BBC |date=2 November 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adlington later went on to comment on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8575567/Rebecca-Adlington-Im-over-the-Frankie-Boyle-spoon-jibe.html |title=Rebecca Adlington: I'm over the Frankie Boyle spoon jibe |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=20 October 2011 |location=London |first=Anita |last=Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Queen ===
In October 2008, during [[The Russell Brand Show prank telephone calls row|''The Russell Brand Show'' prank telephone calls row]], Boyle found himself in the midst of a scandal when the BBC broadcast a ''Mock the Week'' repeat in which he made a joke about [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]]. Whilst pretending to be the Queen in the "Scenes We'd Like To See" segment of ''Mock The Week'', Boyle said "I am now so old, my pussy is haunted". This caused many to complain about the state that the BBC had come to, with [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[David Davies (Welsh politician)|David Davies]] calling the joke a "disgracefully foul comment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rashid Razaq |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23580712-corporation-attacked-for-offensive-joke-about-the-queen.do |title=Corporation attacked for offensive joke about the Queen |publisher=ThisIsLondon.co.uk |date=31 October 2008 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle was eventually cleared of any misconduct by the BBC Trust, although they called the comment "sexist and ageist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Tara Conlan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/19/frankie-boyle-mock-the-week |title=Frankie Boyle's 'sexist' joke about Queen cleared by BBC Trust |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 October 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Down's syndrome ===
In a performance on his 2010 tour, Boyle interrupted a "long, seemingly semi-improvised skit" about [[Down syndrome]] by challenging a woman in the front row who seemed uncomfortable with the material.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; The audience member explained that her five-year-old daughter had the condition and strongly criticised Boyle's portrayal of people with Down syndrome.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Walker | first = Peter | title = Frankie Boyle meets his match in mother of a child with Down syndrome | newspaper = The Guardian | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited | date = 8 April 2010  | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/apr/08/frankie-boyle-downs-syndrome  | accessdate =12 April 2010 | location=London | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

=== Palestine and Israel ===
In April 2010, the [[BBC Trust]]'s Editorial Standards Committee apologised for a joke made by Boyle on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] panel show ''[[Political Animal (radio show)|Political Animal]]'' in which he likened the situation in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] to "a cake being punched to pieces by a very angry [[Jewish|Jew]]". Boyle also made another joke where he said that he had "been studying Israeli Army martial arts. I now know 16 ways to kick a Palestinian woman in the back".&lt;ref name="palestinerow"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8650254.stm |title=BBC apologises for Frankie Boyle joke |publisher=BBC |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Boyle published a letter in which he criticised the Trust's "cowardly rebuke of my jokes about Palestine" and reprinted the jokes in question. He then criticised the BBC for not broadcasting a humanitarian appeal during the 2008–2009 [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]], saying that it was "tragic for such a great institution but it is now cravenly afraid of giving offence and vulnerable to any kind of well drilled lobbying." Boyle then said that the situation in Palestine "seems to be, in essence, apartheid", concluding that he had reached this position after watching a documentary about life in Palestine that he said had driven him to tears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Boyle | first = Frankie | author-link =   | title = Frankie Boyle letter about BBC in full  | newspaper = The Telegraph  | date = 1 May 2010  | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/7660232/Frankie-Boyle-letter-about-BBC-in-full.html  | accessdate =1 May 2010 | location=London  | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In 2018, Boyle accused BBC television producers of "editing out" comments he made on ''New World Order'' about [[2018 Gaza border protests| Palestinian deaths on the Gaza border]] and his joke about "Israel being an Apartheid state”.&lt;ref name="newworldediting"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/frankie-boyle-new-world-order-antisemitism-bbc-1.464439 |title=Frankie Boyle claims 'Apartheid' Israel jokes were cut from BBC show |publisher=The Jewish Chronichle|date=22 May 2018 |accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harvey Price ===
In December 2010, both [[Katie Price]] (a.k.a. Jordan) and [[Peter Andre]] were said to have been left "absolutely disgusted and sickened" by a joke that was made on ''[[Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights]]'' about Price's heavily disabled son, Harvey. On the show, Boyle said: "Apparently Jordan and Peter Andre are fighting each other over custody of Harvey. Well eventually one of them will lose ... and have to keep him." Then he added: "I have a theory that Jordan married a cage fighter ([[Alex Reid (fighter)|Alex Reid]]) because she needed someone strong enough to stop Harvey from fucking her."&lt;ref name="pricejoke"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Christian Tobin |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a292233/price-andre-sickened-by-frankie-boyle-joke.html |title=Price, Andre "sickened" by Frankie Boyle joke |publisher=[[DigitalSpy]] |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andre's representative also responded to the comments made by Boyle and said "We're all disgusted by these comments. Peter is angry and very upset at Harvey being mocked in this way. Children, especially a disabled youngster, should be off-limits." Both confirmed that they had sought legal action and wrote a complaint to Channel 4 regarding Boyle's jokes with Price saying: "To bully this unbelievably brave child is despicable; to broadcast it is to show a complete and utter lack of judgement. I have asked my lawyers to write to Channel 4."&lt;ref name="pricejoke" /&gt; [[Ofcom]] confirmed that Price issued a complaint and accordingly launched an investigation into the programme.&lt;ref name="tramadolinvestigated"&gt;{{Cite news|author=John Plunkett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/10/frankie-boyle-katie-price |title=Frankie Boyle's Katie Price joke sparks Ofcom investigation |publisher=The Guardian |date=10 December 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, Ofcom ruled Channel 4 had breached broadcasting rules by transmitting the material in question but did not require the network to broadcast an apology saying that it was an "erroneous decision on a matter of editorial judgment on the broadcaster's part". Price criticised the decision not to require a broadcast apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23938327-ofcom-slams-frankie-boyle-jokes-about-katie-prices-disabled-son-harvey.do |title=Ofcom slams Frankie Boyle 'jokes' about Katie Price's disabled son Harvey |publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk |date=4 April 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle discussed the material onstage at a charity gig some months later, saying that the joke was intended to highlight how Price exploited her son, and that he felt the two aspects of Price's media profile, "her disabled son and her sexuality", did not belong together. He rejected comments that the joke may have led to playground bullying, saying that "I find it hard to believe there are kids at that school who would like to slag Harvey, but can't think of an angle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2011/03/22/13005/frankie_boyle_stands_firm_over_harvey_gag |title=Chortle.co.uk |publisher=Chortle.co.uk |date=22 March 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegations of racism and  consequent libel action ===
In July 2011, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' published an article strongly criticizing Boyle which alleged he had been forced to quit ''Mock the Week'' and described him as a "racist comedian". Boyle, in response, sued the ''Mirror'' for libel. In October 2012, a jury found in his favour, ordering the ''Mirror'' to pay him £54,650 in damages, all of which he donated to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title=Frankie Boyle wins more than £50,000 libel damages from Daily Mirror|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/frankie-boyle-libel-damages-daily-mirror|accessdate=23 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 October 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Give It Up for Comic Relief'' ===
On 6 March 2013, Boyle caused controversy when he was invited to perform at [[Russell Brand]]'s [[BBC Three]] fundraiser ''Give It Up for Comic Relief'' at [[Wembley Arena]]. He made a series of jokes about Comic Relief itself, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]], [[Oscar Pistorius]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and the [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal]].&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/i-wish-the-queen-had-died-offensive-frankie-boyle-jokes-cut-from-bbc-comic-relief-broadcast-8524030.html|title='I wish the Queen had died': Offensive Frankie Boyle jokes cut from BBC Comic Relief broadcast|work=[[The Independent]]|date=7 March 2013|accessdate=8 April 2013|location=London|first=Daisy|last=Wyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was deemed so distasteful that his entire six-minute performance was cut out of the broadcast version of the 3.5-hour show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/03/07/frankie-boyle-russell-brand-give-it-up-for-comic-relief-_n_2826899.html | title=Frankie Boyle Axed From Russell Brand's 'Give It Up For Comic Relief' Show On BBC Three Over 'Disgusting' Jokes | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=7 March 2013 | accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a follower of [[Noam Chomsky]] and says that he has had a great influence on his political beliefs, claiming to be more [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] than Chomsky himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/dec/19/frankie-boyle-celebrity-memoirs | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | title=Frankie Boyle lays into celebrity memoirs as his own is a surprise hit | date=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During one of his interviews, he has also claimed to be a follower of [[Advaita Vedanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDQJ8gQHvME |title=frankie boyle the interview |publisher=YouTube |date=4 August 2013 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Boyle supported [[Shaker Aamer]], the last UK resident being held at [[Guantanamo Bay]], by going on a [[hunger strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23389757|title=Frankie Boyle hunger strike in support of Shaker Aamer|work=BBC News|date=20 July 2013|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle is a supporter of the Glasgow-based [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] Football Club.

Boyle's comedy influences include [[Billy Connolly|Sir Billy Connolly]], [[Bill Hicks]] and [[Spike Milligan]]. The fellow Scottish shock comedian [[Jerry Sadowitz]] is often cited as an influence on Boyle, although Boyle himself has discounted this.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Boyle is a supporter of [[Scottish independence]]. When asked "How do you feel about independence?" Frankie replied with "Yes, I think we should be independent. What have we got to lose? A [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]] government? I'm looking forward to the vote just because it will be a novelty for Scottish people to fill in official forms while still in possession of their own belt and shoelaces. And imagine what Scotland's annual Independence Day celebrations will look like; the fucking D-Day Landings." Boyle revealed via his Twitter account that he votes for the [[Scottish Green Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/comedy/features/306416-what_offends_frankie_boyle|title=What Offends Frankie Boyle?|work=The Skinny|date=4 December 2013|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2017, Boyle supported [[Jack Thomas (swimmer)|Jack Thomas]], a British Paralympic swimmer who suffered a number of unfortunate career setbacks, via Twitter and through donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/wales/41672180|title=Jack Thomas: Swimmer's funding boost from Frankie Boyle and Michael Sheen|date=2017-10-18|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-12-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview on [[The Jonathan Ross Show]] in 2012, Boyle revealed that he has a fear of flying, and travels to shows in England by train.

'''''Freaknik: The Musical''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] [[television special]] produced by [[T-Pain]]. It features the voice of T-Pain as the Ghost of Freaknik, as well as the voices of entertainers such as [[Lil Wayne]], [[Young Cash]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Sophia Fresh]], and [[Rick Ross]], and [[comedian]]s such as [[Andy Samberg]] and [[Charlie Murphy]] who provide additional voices. It was scheduled to air on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late night programming block [[Adult Swim]] sometime in 2009, but after several push-backs, it premiered on March 7, 2010. The musical is based on the actual music festival [[Freaknik|of the same name]] that used to take place in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

A [[#Soundtrack|soundtrack]] was released by [[Jive Records|Jive]] and [[Nappy Boy Entertainment|Nappy Boy]] on April 20, 2010. The 50-minute uncut version of ''Freaknik: The Musical'' has been released on [[DVD]] and other forms of home media.

== Plot ==
The movie starts at a party that a group of young adults ([[Christopher "Kid" Reid]] and [[Affion Crockett]]) claims is the best [[House Party (film)|party]] they have ever attended. An elderly man ([[Lil Jon]]) joins the party and explains the history of [[Freaknik]]. He tells them that Freaknik threw the biggest party of all time, until it was broken up by the police in 1998; he claims the police "killed" Freaknik. Kid n' Play tried to convince that Freaknik is an urban legend like [[Candyman (film)|Candyman]], but as Play looks in the mirror, they were eaten by a swarm of wasps. The group is then led by the old man in [[summoning]] Freaknik, who appears as the Ghost of Freaknik Past ([[T-Pain]]).

The scene changes to a radio announcer named Mr. Thanksgiving ([[DJ Drama]]), who is interviewing Freaknik. Mr. Thanksgiving and Freaknik explain that a rapping contest will be held, the victory of which will get "a lifetime supply of [[money]], [[clothes]], and [[Prostitution|hoes]]". The scene changes once more to the bedroom of Virgil ([[Young Cash]]), Big Uzi ([[Rick Ross]]), and Light Skin ([[CeeLo Green]]), collectively known as the Sweet Tea Mobsters, a group of young adult rappers from Sweet Tea, Florida, who hope to achieve fame. The group decides to drive to Atlanta to participate in the aforementioned contest, along with their [[Cannabis (drug)|weed]]-smoking (and supplying) friend Doela Man ([[DJ Pooh]]).

During their journey, Light Skin tells of a secret society of African Americans called the [[Sigma Pi Phi|Boule]], fraternity parlance for "a council of noblemen", that seeks to guide the course of black culture. The members of this organization are parodies of [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Al Sharpton]] ([[Charlie Murphy]]), [[Bill Cosby]] ([[Kel Mitchell]]), [[Russell Simmons]] ([[Affion Crockett]]), [[O. J. Simpson]], and [[Jesse Jackson]].  They wear medallions inscribed "10%", an allusion to the [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] essay [[The Talented Tenth]], which says that a class of exceptional members of the black race will rise to lead it.

The Sweet Tea Mobsters make a number of pit stops, including a detour at a college fraternity party where they meet two alcoholic fraternity members ([[Bill Hader]] and [[Andy Samberg]]). While Virgil is fueling the gas tank, A car, inhabited by four sexy-looking women ([[Sophia Fresh]]) named Leacosia ([[Sophia Fresh|Crystal]]), Toprameneesha ([[Sophia Fresh|Skye]]), Obamaniqua ([[Sophia Fresh|Cole Rose]]), and Suzie ([[Sophia Fresh|Crystal]]), arrives. He tried to refuse, but the girls beg in song, besides Leacosia giving Virgil a kiss in the form of a gun. He accepts.

Meanwhile, Freaknik meets Rev. Sharpton, who tried to force him to work for the Boule. The plan fails as Freaknik says that he will "never, ever turn his back on his own people", so he escorts Sharpton out via trapdoor.

At the party, the group meets the Fruit Bowl Boys ([[Kel Mitchell]], [[Affion Crockett]], and [[Denzel Whitaker]]), who later become the group’s biggest competition and are from the mostly white suburbs of Sweet Tea, Florida (although they resemble the Sweet Tea Mobsters). On their long, winding road trip, the Sweet Tea Mob gets lost in New Orleans and are confronted by a gangster ([[Snoop Dogg]]) who makes them visit his boss, Trap Jesus ([[Lil Wayne]]). Upon meeting Trap Jesus, the group loses hope, thinking it is the end, but instead he inspires them to compete and gives them one of his many [[Lamborghini]]s to use to get to Atlanta. However, they crash the Lamborghini when Big Uzi becomes enraged after hearing the Fruit Bowl Boys talking about his jail experience. The group gives up except Virgil, who believes that winning the contest is their destiny. The rest of the group still doesn't believe him until they are given a ride in an airplane by the "Flying [[Malcolm X|Malcolms]]."

Meanwhile, the Freaknik character is elected the "ghost mayor of Atlanta" and dubs the city "Freaknation." Soon after, President [[Barack Obama]] hands the presidency over to the ghost of Freaknik, a move that greatly angers Oprah, which wants to see Freaknik destroyed. She devises a plan to send a giant robotic monster called the "Perminator" (a robotic version of Al Sharpton, rebuilt from Sharpton's corpse after he got hit by lightning while blowing out his hair) to Atlanta to destroy Freaknik. Meanwhile, at the party, the Fruit Bowl Boys begin singing "Shank Ya in the Shower." The Sweet Tea Mobsters arrive at Atlanta at the same time as the Perminator begins its attack; it kills the Fruit Bowl Boys almost immediately. He seems to have Freaknik down for the count, but mass love from the crowd empowers Freaknik as the Mob performs, giving him the ability to grow to a monstrous size. Using the love of his fans, Freaknik is able to destroy the Perminator.

After the fight, Freaknik declares the Sweet Tea Mobsters the winners of the contest, but Virgil refuses the prize and tears the check in half. He tells Freaknik that he doesn't need it as long as Freaknik comes back every year, but before he can finish speaking, a golden lion statue-shaped ship comes right in, inhabited by the members of the Boule. But as Freaknik is about to disqualify them, a dog-shaped spacecraft called the "[[Mothership Connection]]" arrives, killing the Boule and their ship (Note: This scene can only be seen on the uncut version of the special). It is inhabited by three brightly colored aliens who are actually [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], [[Bootsy Collins]], and Gene "King Poo Poo Man" Anderson. They say they have come to take Freaknik because "there are other galaxies that need his powers of positivity", saying that maybe someday he will return and they can "funk it up" once again. Freaknik gives Virgil his gold chain and says that Atlanta will always be his home. Suzie approaches Freaknik, telling him her baby (which looks like Freaknik) needs a father. Freaknik then rushes on board the ship with Clinton, Collins, and Anderson. Mr. Thanksgiving, the radio DJ from the beginning of the show, then speaks, saying how crazy that was and they'll see us next time; Freaknik is seen dancing on the Mothership as it leaves Earth. And after the end credits, we see Sweet Tea taping the check back together.

[[File:Gökbez1.jpg|thumb|Gökbez relief]]
The [[Hittite empire|Hittite]] '''Gökbez relief''' is a [[rock relief]] at Gökbez and dates from the time of the [[Syro-Hittite states|Neo-Hittite states]].  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 

== Location ==
The relief is in a courtyard in [[Gökbez, Bor|Gökbez]], [[Bor, Niğde|Bor]] district, [[Niğde Province]], [[Turkey]], about 12&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Kemerhisar]] and 22&amp;nbsp;km south of the provincial capital of [[Niğde]]. Kemerhisar is the site of the ancient city of [[Tyana]] and was centre of the minor [[Luwian]] state of [[Tuwanuwa]]. The ancient route from Tyana, through [[Faustinopolis|Halala]] to the [[Cilician Gates]], which were probably already in use in Hittite times.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Berges, Johannes Nollé: ''Tyana - Archäologisch-historische Untersuchungen zum südwestlichen Kappadokien''. Rudolf Habelt, Bonn 2000 {{ISBN|3-7749-2959-9}} p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt; The relief lies beside the old path.

== Description ==
The relief lies broken away and on its side in a courtyard in the village, leaning on the exterior wall of a house. The stone block measures 3.0 metres wide and 2.4 m high, the relief is 2.0 m x 2.0 m. The badly weathered image shows the god [[Tarhunna|Tarhunzas]] facing left. He holds a [[double axe]] in his right hand and a thunderbolt in his left. The god has a beard and long hair which falls to his shoulders. He is dressed in a knee-length robe with a broad belt. A vine grows up between his legs and grape clusters hang down beside him to the left. To the right of the figure is a double arch with a horizontal line running across it two thirds of the way up. [[Dietrich Berges]] and  [[Johannes Nollé]] suggest that it probably originally contained (or was intended to contain) an inscription. Eringhaus thought it was a [[Phrygia]]n double idol, like that described by Dietrich Brendt at [[Yazılıkaya, Eskişehir|Midas Kenti]].&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Berndt. "Midasstadt: Kleine und kleinste Felsmonumente. Überlegungen zu einer frühen Besiedlung." in Elmar Schwertheim, Engelbert Winter (Ed.): ''Neue Funde und Forschungen in Phrygien.'' Asia Minor Studien 61, 2006 pp.&amp;nbsp;1–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The posture and costume of the figure show strong similarities to the [[Niğde Stele]] (on display in the [[Niğde Archaeological Museum]]), which also depicts Tarhunzas. For this reason, the relief is dated to the late 8th or early 7th century BC.

'''Imamzadeh Mausoleum''' is a monument consists of a mausoleum and mosque, located in the center of Barda. The monument, which was the only 4 minarets built in Azerbaijan in the 14th century, was in the form of a pilgrimage-mausoleum, according to academician Dorn. A mosque was built around it in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bərdə İmamzadəsi: layihənin icrası başa çatır//İki sahil - 19 March 2015, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

[[Abbasgulu Bakikhanov | Abbasqulu Agha Bakikhanov]] mentioned in his famous Gulistani-Iram work in 1841: "In many ways, the ruins of the village and the high-ranking three imamzadehs in the cities of Shamakhi, Ganja and Barda, Imamzadeh in the Bulbule village show that this country has always been the homeland of the religious elders"  &lt;ref&gt;Gulistani-Iram 15, p.35-37&lt;/ref&gt;

According to reports, 5th Imam of Ismaili and Jafari Shiite, Mohammed al-Baqir’s granddaughter was buried here. Mohammed al-Baqir's third son, Ibrahim Isa, was buried in Goy Imamzadeh (in 739), 7th km of the city of Ganja. This monument is similar to the monument "Char Minar" in Bukhara. A.A.Bakikhanov also noted in his Gulistani-Iram work that this was a sacred place of pilgrimage in Barda. The fact that this place is a sanctuary also confirms that there is no mosque in Imamzadeh. Figured layout of the bricks of Imamzadeh mosque, coordination of stone and brick in construction, and the use of tiles appear to be influenced from [[Barda Mausoleum]] (built in 1322). The monument was rebuilt in 1868 by the famous architect [[Karbalayi Safikhan Karabakhi]] (1788, Ahar-1910, Shusha). He served in the development of Karabakh architecture. Karbalayi Safikhan Karabakhi linked the architectural elements of the eastern architecture with local traditions, especially in the mosques he built. Restoration of Imamzadeh Mosque in Barda (1868), Aghdam Mosque (1870), Ashagi Mosque in Shusha (1874-75) and Govharaga Mosque Restoration (XIX century), as well as the Tatar Mosque in Odessa (1870), Garabaghli Mosque (1880) in Ashgabat Safikhan are among works of Karabakhi.  
Believers died in other places but were buried in a cemetery around the Imamzadeh mosque in Barda, according to their testimony.

There are several historic monuments around the Imamzadeh Mosque. 20 meters to the north of the mosque, [[Bahman Mirza Qajar Mausoleum]] and to the east, ruins of [[Akhsadan Baba Mausoleum]], which was built in XIV century, are located.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4802">[[Valuation (finance)|Valuation]] is considered as one of the most critical areas in [[finance]]; it plays a key role in many areas of [[finance]] such as buy/sell, [[solvency]], [[merger]] and [[Takeover|acquisition]].

==Rationale==
There are numerous individual reasons or motivations for conducting an intellectual property valuation or economic [[Economic appraisal|appraisal]] analysis. A valuation is prepared, for example, for [[Financial transaction|transactions]], [[pricing]] and strategic purposes, [[financing]] [[securitization]] and [[collateralization]], [[tax]] planning and [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]], and litigation support.

==Factors driving the value of intellectual property==

Intellectual property derives its value from a wide range of significant parameters such as [[market share]], [[barriers to entry]], legal protection, IP’s profitability, [[Industry|industrial]] and [[economic]] factors, growth projections, remaining economic life, and new [[technologies]].

== Approaches==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2008}}
The valuation process necessitates gathering much more information as well as in-depth understanding of [[economy]], [[industry]], and specific business that directly affect the value of the [[intellectual property]]. Therefore, such information may be gathered from external and / or internal sources. Finally, the information is devoted to be turned into financial models to estimate the fundamental value of a particular type of intellectual property based on such adapted International Valuation Standards.

* [[Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice]] (USPAP)
* [[International Valuation Standards Committee]] (IVSC) (50 Countries)
* [[US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP)
* [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS)
* [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB)

The valuation analysts use numerous approaches in order to reach a reasonable indication of a defined value for the subject intangible assets on a certain date which is referred to as the valuation date. The most common approaches to estimate the fundamental or fair value of the intellectual property are defined as the following:
 
1. '''Cost approach:''' The [[cost]] approach is based on the economic principle of [[substitution (economics)|substitution]].  This principle states that an [[investor]] will pay no more for an asset than the cost to obtain, by [[purchasing]] or constructing, a substitute asset of equal utility. There are several cost approach valuation methods, the most common being the historical cost, replacement cost, and replication cost.

2.''' Market approach:''' The [[Market (economics)|market]] approach is based on the [[economic]] principle of [[competition]] and [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. These principles conclude that, in a free and unrestricted [[Market (economics)|market]], [[supply and demand]] factors will drive the [[price]] of an asset at equilibrium point. Furthermore, it provides an indication of the value by comparing the price at which similar property has exchanged between willing buyers and sellers. Data on such similar transactions may be accessed in several public sources, including specialized royalty rate databases.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

3. '''Income approach:''' This approach estimates the fair value of intellectual property by discounting the future economic benefits of ownership at an appropriate discount rate.

4. '''Direct approach:''' The direct approach is based on the current value of shares of [[intellectual property]] in an Intellectual Property (IP) Share Market.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/27084/title/Time-for-an-IP-Share-Market-/ 'Lyons-Weiler, J. 2009.', '''The Scientist'''], ''Time for an IP Share Market?''.&lt;/ref&gt;

5. Using the pay-off method on top of the four above mentioned methods is a way to enhance the valuation and analysis of intellectual property &lt;ref&gt;[http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/12687/1/JIPR%2016%285%29%20377-384.pdf Collan, M. and Heikkilä, M., 2011, Enhancing Patent Valuation with the Pay-Off Method, Journal of Intellectual Property Rights, 16, 5, 377-384]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rally==
In June 1996 a branch of the Ku Klux Klan announced plans to hold a rally in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mich. woman aids man being beaten|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/290785877.html?FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun%2025,%201996&amp;author=AP&amp;pub=Boston%20Globe%20(pre-1997%20Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Mich.%20woman%20aids%20man%20being%20beaten|accessdate=October 30, 2013|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=June 25, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several people in the Ann Arbor area planned to hold a protest against the Ku Klux Klan's presence on the day of the rally. Thomas was one of several people that attended and protested from an area that had been fenced and set aside for the protesters.&lt;ref name="TA"&gt;{{cite news|last=Paine|first=Chris|title=Why black teenager Keshia Thomas saved a white supremacist|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/why-black-teenager-keshia-thomas-saved-a-white-supremacist/story-e6frg6n6-1226749697993|accessdate=October 30, 2013|newspaper=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protest proceeded until one protester announced over a megaphone that there was "a Klansman in the crowd".&lt;ref name="TA"/&gt; The unnamed man was a middle-aged white male wearing a T-shirt depicting the [[Confederate flag]] and an "SS tattoo".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wynne|first=Catherine|title=The teenager who saved a man with an SS tattoo|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24653643|accessdate=October 30, 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man began to run but was knocked down, kicked, and beaten with [[placards]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

Thomas, who was at that time 18 years old, shielded the man from the crowd and shouted for the attackers to stop and is credited as saying that you "can't beat goodness into a person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gillette|first1=Ethel|title=As Thanksgiving Day approaches, there is much to be thankful about |newspaper=The Tampa Tribune |date=November 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after that point the police arrived on the scene.&lt;ref name="HDE"&gt;{{cite news|title=Teen Who Saved Man At Klan Rally Wanted to Stop Mob Attack|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fk9BAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4qgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4988,2510165&amp;dq=keshia-thomas&amp;hl=en|accessdate=October 30, 2013|newspaper=Harlan Daily Enterprise|date=June 25, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A news report stated that seven anti-Klansmen protesters were arrested at the event and a large group of protesters were [[tear gas]]sed after they attempted to enter the police station where fifteen Klansmen were being kept for their safety.&lt;ref name="HDE"/&gt; The police later reported that the man was not a Klan member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guardian Angel|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20141729,00.html|accessdate=October 30, 2013|newspaper=People magazine|date=July 8, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the rally Thomas was praised for her actions by Senator [[Ernest Hollings]] and a reporter for ''The Day'' commented that while the man was "wrong for the views he sanctioned", the protesters were also in the wrong "in their violence against him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alone in the Mob|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vw1HAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JvgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4178,1693389&amp;dq=keshia-thomas&amp;hl=en|accessdate=October 30, 2013|newspaper=The Day|date=July 11, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hollings|first1=Ernest F.|title=KESHIA THOMAS: LEADING BY EXAMPLE|url=http://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t17.d18.c4b088c70e001e9a?accountid=10559|accessdate=February 21, 2016|issue=Vol. 142 No. 97 Pg. S7204|publisher=Congressional Record Daily Edition (subscription required)|date=June 27, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas expressed that she had protected the man due to her own religious convictions and because she "knew what it was like to be hurt ... The many times that that happened, I wish someone would have stood up for me." A few months after the June event, Thomas was thanked by the son of the unnamed man she rescued.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

'''''Lydia Crocheting in the Garden at Marly''''' is an [[oil on canvas]] painting by [[Mary Cassatt]] created in 1880. It is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

==Early history and creation==
Mary Cassatt's family had come to visit her at [[Marly-le-Roi]] in the summer of 1880 where the painter was living with her sister Lydia. Lydia, who suffered from [[Bright's disease]], had moved from Philadelphia to live with Cassatt after she had relocated to Paris. At the time, unmarried women did not live alone, but as Lydia's disease progressed, she was no longer able to travel. The remainder of the family joined the sisters in the summer of 1880 and Cassatt's work at that time shifted to images depicting home life. Lydia became a frequent subject of Cassatt's work until her death in 1882.{{sfn|Weinberg|2009|p=229}} Typically, Cassatt avoided [[plein air]] painting, though this work captures the sunlight, evidencing that it was painted in the garden.{{sfn|The Metropolitan Museum of Art|2016}}

==Later history and display==
The painting was first shown at the Sixth Impressionist Exhibition, in [[Paris]] with eleven other works by Cassatt in 1881.{{sfn|Clement|Houzé|Erbolato-Ramsey|2000|p=25}} In 1893, the painting was listed in the inventory of the art dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]]. By the following year, [[Peter Arrell Browne Widener]], a Philadelphia collector, had obtained the work. Later, Cassatt's brother [[Alexander Cassatt]] reacquired the painting and it remained in the family until Mrs. Gardner Cassatt donated it to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1965.{{sfn|Weinberg|2009|p=229}}{{sfn|The Metropolitan Museum of Art|2016}}

==Description and interpretation==
Immediately following the [[American Civil War]], paintings of women in the presence of elegant gardens became popular. Following this tradition, the work depicts Lydia in the garden, crocheting, though the painting distinctly sets Lydia apart from the blossoms.{{sfn|Farr|Carter|2009|pp=78-79}} Painted in an [[Impressionist]] style, the greenhouse and orderly rows of plants are behind Lydia,{{sfn|Weinberg|2009|p=229}}{{sfn|Marter|2011|p=415}} who is shown as occupied and seemingly unaware of the garden at her back.{{sfn|Farr|Carter|2009|p=79}} Her pale face and pallid complexion are offset by the tartan and lace-cuffed garment she wears. Lydia appears to be enjoying her time in the sunshine beneath her lace bonnet and gloves.{{sfn|Weinberg|2009|p=229}}{{sfn|Davey|2008|p=157}} ''Lydia Crocheting in the Garden at Marly'', along with ''Lydia Seated in the Garden with a Dog in Her Lap'' and ''Katherine Cassatt Reading to Her Grandchildren'' remain some of her finest pictures from this period of her career.{{sfn|McCullough|2012|p=393}}

'''Mary Maud Page''' (21 September 1867 [[London]] - 8 February 1925 [[Cape Town]]) was an English-born South African botanical illustrator. She was the daughter of Nathaniel Page, a former mayor of [[Croydon]].

She studied painting, but due to failing eyesight changed to courses in wood-carving and metals and enamels, and became skilled in needlework, embroidery and lace-making. She also studied [[Braille]] in order to help a blind friend. When her father died and faced with her own failing health, she left for South Africa in July 1911. She settled in [[Dealesville]] in the [[Orange Free State]] at first, but soon moved to [[Bloemfontein]] in 1912. From there she visited [[Palapye]] and [[Pretoria]], and toured [[Rhodesia]] and [[Basutoland]], returning to the latter country a number of times. It was there that her interest in botany was born, starting a collection of plant specimens and helping a friend, Mrs Beaumont, to create a herbarium for use by the children of [[Morija]]. While visiting Cape Town in January 1915 she showed some flower illustrations to [[Louisa Bolus]] who was struck by their quality, and persuaded her to work at the [[Bolus Herbarium]], an association which lasted until her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Gideon F.|last2=Walker|first2=Colin C.|title=The botanical paintings of Mary Maud Page|journal=Bradleya|date=2001|volume=19|issue=19|pages=124–124|doi=10.25223/brad.n19.2001.a1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of her illustrations dealt with [[Aizoaceae]], but she also depicted [[Iridaceae]] and orchids. Many of her paintings appeared in [[Flowering Plants of Africa]] and were used in books by [[Adolar Gottlieb Julius Herre|Hans Herre]]. A handbook on culinary herbs written by her was published by the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]. She was commemorated in the now defunct plant genus ''Pagella'' [[Schönland]] (1921), but also in ''Conophytum pageae'', ''Nemesia pageae'', ''Crassula pageae'', ''Erica pageana'', the former taxa ''Psilocaulon pageae'' (now ''P. dinteri''), ''Carpobrotus pageae'' (now ''C. mellei''), and ''Erepsia pageae'' (now ''E. patula''), and possibly also for ''Amphithalea pageae'' and ''Muraltia pageae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charters|first1=M.|title=The Eponym Dictionary of Southern African Plants: Plant Names P-S|url=http://www.calflora.net/southafrica/1P-S.html|website=www.calflora.net|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''October''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] specializing in [[contemporary art]], [[art criticism|criticism]], and [[critical theory|theory]], published by [[MIT Press]].

==History==
''October'' was established in 1976 in New York by [[Rosalind E. Krauss]] and [[Annette Michelson]], who left ''[[Artforum]]'' to do so.&lt;ref name="Smith2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/25/arts/design/25benglis.html?_r=0 | title=Art or Ad or What?

The journal was a participant in introducing French [[Post-structuralism|post-structural theory]] on the English-speaking academic scene.&lt;ref name = ArtStory/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cusste2009"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = U of Minnesota Press| isbn = 978-0-8166-4732-3| last = Cusset| first = François| title = French Theory: How Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, &amp; Co. Transformed the Intellectual Life of the United States| date = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Art Story'', Krauss used the journal "as a way to publish essays on her emergent ideas on post-structuralist art theory, Deconstructionist theory, psychoanalysis, postmodernism and feminism".&lt;ref name = ArtStory/&gt; [[Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe]], one of the co-founders of the journal, withdrew after only a few issues, and by the spring of 1977, [[Douglas Crimp]] joined the editorial team. In 1990, after Crimp left the journal, Krauss and Michelson were joined by [[Yve-Alain Bois]], [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]], [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]], Denis Hollier, and [[John Rajchman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://trikster.net/2/crimp/1.html |title=Mathias Danbolt, Front Room – Back Room: An Interview with Douglas Crimp |work=Trikster – Nordic Queer Journal #2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-26|postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
As well as in-depth articles and reviews of 20th century and contemporary art, the journal features critical interpretations of cinema and popular culture from a progressive viewpoint.

==Impact==
According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the journal was an "influential vehicle for the debate surrounding the emergence of postmodernism and New Historicism in 20th-century art-historical studies", and the journal "contributed greatly to Anglo-American academics’ adoption of French theoretical innovations, especially those pertaining to the analysis of cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Rosalind-E-Krauss#ref1041327 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |work=Rosalind E. Krauss |accessdate=2016-01-09|postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Art Story'' describes the journal as "significant for revisiting and stressing the historical importance of early modes of 20th-century avant-garde art, such as Cubism, Surrealism and Expressionism".&lt;ref name = ArtStory/&gt;

[[File:Entrevista Michael Bauer CCCB.webm|thumb|Interview with Michael Bauer, Open Knowledge International former employee at [[Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cccb.org/lab/video_michael-bauer-necessitem-periodistes-per-posar-les-dades-en-context/|title=Michael Bauer: "Necessitem periodistes per posar les dades en context" - Vídeo - CCCB LAB|date=3 June 2013|work=cccb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Many of Open Knowledge International's projects are technical in nature. Its most prominent project, [[CKAN]], is used by many of the world's governments to host open catalogues of data that their countries possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=data.gov.uk|title=Project Info: Who is Involved with the project?|url=http://data.gov.uk/about/|publisher=HM Government|quote=These include the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN): CKAN stores the catalogue behind data.gov.uk and a growing number of open data registries around the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation tends to support its aims by hosting infrastructure for semi-independent projects to develop. This approach to organising was hinted as one of its earliest projects was a project management service called KnowledgeForge, which runs on the [[KForge]] platform. ''KnowledgeForge'' allows sectoral [[working group]]s to have space to manage projects related to open knowledge. More widely, the project infrastructure includes both technical and [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] aspects. The organisation hosts several dozen mailing lists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Open Knowledge Foundation|title = lists.okfn.org Mailing Lists|url = http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for virtual discussion, utilises [[IRC]] for real-time communications and also hosts events.

=== Advocacy ===

Open Knowledge International is an active partner with organisations working in similar areas, such as open educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Open Educational Resources Commons|title = About|url = http://www.oercommons.org/about|accessdate = 1 November 2015|quote = Strategic Development and Outreach Partners ... Open Knowledge Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open Knowledge International has produced the [[Open Knowledge Definition]], an attempt to clarify some of the ambiguity surrounding the terminology of openness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://opendefinition.org/|title = Open Definition|publisher = Open Definition|date = 2011-06-17|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Open Software Service Definition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.okfn.org/2008/07/14/open-software-service-definition-launched/|title = Open Software Service Definition Launched|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also supported the development of the [[Open Database License]] (ODbL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Creative Commons|title = CC Salon Berlin and openeverything focus – Feb. 26|url = https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12919|accessdate = 29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of technology, Open Knowledge International plays a role in advocating for openness broadly. This includes supporting the drafting of reports, facilitating consultation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Open Society Foundations|title = Public Feedback Solicited on Access to Information and Open Government Data|url = http://www.soros.org/initiatives/information/focus/communication/news/access-consultation-20100910|accessdate = 1 November 2015|date = September 2010|quote = Information Program grantee Access Info Europe, together with the Open Knowledge Foundation, are holding a public consultation on open government data and the right of access to information.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Electronic Frontier Foundation|title = Digital Rights Management: A failure in the developed world, a danger to the developing world|url = https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-rights-management-failure-developed-world-danger-developing-world|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and producing guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Dietrich|first = Daniel|title = Open Data Manual|url = http://opendatamanual.org/|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rufus Pollock, one of Open Knowledge International's founders, and current board secretary sits on the [[UK government]]'s [[Public Sector Transparency Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = data.govt.uk|title = New Public Sector Transparency Board and Public Data Transparency Principles|url = http://data.gov.uk/blog/new-public-sector-transparency-board-and-public-data-transparency-principles|publisher = HM Government|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technical ===
[[File:Geo-datos.jpeg|frame|Banner for the [[Geodata]] project in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]]][[File:OpenGLAM Logo.svg|thumb|OpenGLAM logo]]
The foundation places a strong interest in the use of [[open source]] technologies. Its software projects are hosted on [[GitHub]], which utilises the [[Git (software)|Git]] [[version control software]]. Some of the projects are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.okfn.org/projects|title = projects - The Open Knowledge Foundation|accessdate = 1 November 2015}} Open Knowledge Projects&lt;/ref&gt;

* CKAN, a tool that provides store for metadata. This enables governments to quickly and cheaply provide a catalogue of their data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Feature Tour {{!}} ckan            - The open source data portal software|url = http://ckan.org/features/|website = ckan.org|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the type of data (and its conditions of use), Datahub may also be able to store a copy of the data or host it in a database, and provide some basic visualisation tools.
* Open bibliography, broadly construed as efforts to catalogue and build tools for working with and publishing bibliographic resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/inf11/jiscexpo/jiscopenbib.aspx|title = Open Bibliography|publisher = JISC|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://openbiblio.net/|title = Open bibliography and Open Bibliographic Data &amp;#124; Open Bibliographic Data Working Group of the Open Knowledge Foundation|work = Openbiblio.net|accessdate = 1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with particular emphasis on those works that are in the [[public domain]] and [[public domain calculators]].

'''''Orca Symphony No. 1''''' is the fourth [[studio album]] by Armenian-American singer [[Serj Tankian]]. The album takes the form of a classical symphony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.noisecreep.com/2012/05/10/serj-tankian-solo-album/|title = Serj Tankian on Being Eclectic, Growing Up in Lebanon and His Relationship With Heavy Metal|publisher = [[Noisecreep]]|date = May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A professionally sampled studio version was released on November 30, 2012, while the live recorded version was released on June 25, 2013 through [[Serjical Strike Records]].&lt;ref name=Release&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.serjtankian.com/news/serj-releasing-two-albums-june-and-july-announces-tour-dates|title = Serj Releasing Two Albums in June and July, Announces Tour Dates|publisher = [[Serj Tankian]]|date = April 25, 2013|accessdate = April 25, 2013|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140307195500/http://www.serjtankian.com/news/serj-releasing-two-albums-june-and-july-announces-tour-dates|archivedate = March 7, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sample of the first act of the album was released on Tankian's [[SoundCloud]] page on May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://soundcloud.com/serjtankian/orca-act-i-short-sample|title = ORCA - Act I Short Sample|publisher = [[SoundCloud]]|accessdate = April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Tankian achieved fame as part of the American rock band [[System of a Down]]. Although the band experimented with various sounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = Chris Nettleton|url =  http://drownedinsound.com/releases/4822/reviews/6744|title = Review of ''System of a Down''|publisher = [[Drowned in Sound]]|accessdate = July 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it wasn't until the band went on hiatus in 2006 that Tankian began to launch his solo career and experiment further.

Tankian's experimentation with classical composition began with ''[[Elect the Dead Symphony]]''. The live album featured the [[Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra]] performing reworked versions of songs from Tankian's debut album ''[[Elect the Dead]]''. His second album, ''[[Imperfect Harmonies]]'', blended classical with traditional rock elements. Tankian described the album as "music that has sat in the vat and matured",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=144365|title=Serj Tankian Discusses 'Imperfect Harmonies' Album In New Video Interview|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the album's influences from several genres.

''Orca Symphony No. 1'', however, is his first complete symphony. The album is structured into four acts that were composed using "non-traditional approaches to classical music." According to Tankian, "''[[Orca]]'' is known as the killer whale, but is really a dark dolphin, a symbolism for human dichotomy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.serjtankian.com/content/composing|title = Composing|publisher = SerjTankian.com|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110106140654/http://www.serjtankian.com/content/composing|archivedate = 2011-01-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Touring==
An orchestral tour supporting ''Orca Symphony No. 1'' will take place after the [[System of a Down]] summer tour.&lt;ref name=Release/&gt; Shows will feature all four acts of the album and will also incorporate performances of many songs from ''[[Elect the Dead Symphony]]''.&lt;ref name=Release/&gt;

[[File:Virgil Solis - Tereus Philomela.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rape of Philomela by Tereus, engraved by Virgil Solis for a 1562 edition of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' (Book VI, 519–562).]]
'''Philomela''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|ɪ|l|ə|ˈ|m|iː|l|ə}}) or '''Philomel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|ə|ˌ|m|ɛ|l}}; {{lang-grc-gre|{{linktext|Φιλομήλη}}}}, ''Philomēlē'') is a minor figure in [[Greek mythology]] and is frequently invoked as a direct and figurative [[symbol]] in literary, artistic, and musical works in the [[Western canon]].

She is identified as being the "princess of Athens" and the younger of two daughters of [[Pandion I]], [[King of Athens]], and [[Zeuxippe]]. Her sister, [[Procne]], was the wife of King [[Tereus]] of [[Thrace]]. While the myth has several variations, the general depiction is that Philomela, after being [[rape]]d and [[Mutilation|mutilated]] by her sister's husband, [[Tereus]], obtains her revenge and is transformed into a [[nightingale]] (''Luscinia megarhynchos''), a [[Bird migration|migratory]] [[passerine]] [[bird]] native to Europe and southwest Asia and noted for its song. Because of the violence associated with the myth, the song of the nightingale is often depicted or interpreted as a sorrowful [[lament]]. Coincidentally, in nature, the female nightingale is mute and only the male of the species sings.&lt;ref name="birdsong1"&gt;Kaplan, Matt. [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/03/090304-nightingale-night-singing.html "Male Nightingales Explore by Day, Seduce by Night"] in National Geographic News (4 March 2009).

(found online [http://phys.org/news/2011-11-nightingale-sang-experienced-males-territories.html here]). (Retrieved 23 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ovid]] and other writers have made the association (either fancifully or mistakenly) that the [[etymology]] of her name was "lover of song," derived from the Greek {{lang|grc|φιλο-}} and {{lang|grc|μέλος}} ("song") instead of {{lang|grc|μῆλον}} ("fruit" or "sheep"). The name means "lover of fruit," "lover of apples,"&lt;ref&gt;Defining φιλόμηλος as "fond of apples or fruit", see Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert; and Jones, Henry Stuart.

(Retrieved 7 October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; or "lover of sheep."&lt;ref&gt;Defining it as "lover of sheep", see White, J. T.

==The story of Philomela in myth==
The most complete and extant rendering of the story of Philomela, Procne, and Tereus can be found in Book VI of the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' of the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (Publius Ovidius Naso) (43 BC – AD 17/18), where the story reaches its full development during antiquity.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela"&gt;Ovid. ''Metamorphoses'' Book VI, lines 424–674. (*Note that the line numbers vary among translations).&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that Ovid relied upon Greek and Latin sources that were available in his era such as the [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|''Bibliotheca'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus]] (2nd century BC),&lt;ref name="FrazerBiblioNote2"&gt;Frazer, Sir James George (translator/editor). Apollodorus, ''Library'' in 2 volumes (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press; London: William Heinemann, Ltd., 1921). See note 2 to section 3.14.8, citing Pearson, A. C.

According to Ovid, in the fifth year of Procne's marriage to [[Tereus]], King of [[Thrace]] and son of [[Ares]], she asked her husband to "Let me at Athens my dear sister see / Or let her come to Thrace, and visit me."&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; Tereus agreed to travel to [[Athens]] and escort her sister, Philomela, to Thrace.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; King Pandion of Athens, the father of Philomela and Procne, was apprehensive about letting his one remaining daughter leave his home and protection and asks Tereus to protect her as if he were her father.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''Bibliotheca'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus (Book III, chapter 14, section 8), in the translation by Sir James George Frazer, Pandion fought a war with Labdacus, King of Thebes and married his daughter Procne to Tereus to secure and alliance and obtain his assistance in fighting Thebes.&lt;/ref&gt; Tereus agrees. However, Tereus [[lust]]ed for Philomela when he first saw her, and that lust grew during the course of the return voyage to Thrace.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt;

[[File:Tereus Philomelam violavit et reclusit.jpg|thumb|300px|"The Rape of Philomela by Tereus", book 6, plate 59. Engraved by [[Johann Wilhelm Baur]] for a 1703 edition of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'']]
Arriving in Thrace, he forced her to a cabin or lodge in the woods and [[rape]]d her.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; After the assault, Tereus threatened her and advised her to keep silent.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; Philomela was defiant and angered Tereus. In his rage, he cut out her tongue and abandoned her in the cabin.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' Philomela's defiant speech is rendered (in an 18th-century English translation) as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Still my revenge shall take its proper time,
And suit the baseness of your hellish crime.
My self, abandon'd, and devoid of shame,
Thro' the wide world your actions will proclaim;
Or tho' I'm prison'd in this lonely den,
Obscur'd, and bury'd from the sight of men,
My mournful voice the pitying rocks shall move,
And my complainings echo thro' the grove.
Hear me, o Heav'n! and, if a God be there,
Let him regard me, and accept my pray'r.&lt;ref name="OvidDrydenGarth1717"&gt;Dryden, John; Addison, Joseph; Eusden, Laurence; Garth, Sir Samuel (translators). Ovid. ''Ovid's Metamorphoses in Fifteen Books, translated by the most eminent hands'' (London: Jacob Tonson, 1717) Volume II, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Rendered unable to speak because of her injuries, Philomela wove a [[tapestry]] (or a [[robe]]&lt;ref name="BibliothecaFrazer"&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'', 3.14.8; in Frazer, Sir James George (translator/editor).

Notes on this passage include references several variations on the myth.&lt;/ref&gt;) that told her story and had it sent to Procne.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; Procne was incensed and in revenge, she killed her son by Tereus, Itys (or Itylos), boiled him and served him as a meal to her husband.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; After Tereus ate Itys, the sisters presented him with the severed head of his son, and he became aware of their conspiracy and his cannibalistic meal.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; He snatched up an axe and pursued them with the intent to kill the sisters.&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt; They fled but were almost overtaken by Tereus at Daulia in Phocis.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaFrazer" /&gt; In desperation, they prayed to the gods to be turned into birds and escape Tereus' rage and vengeance.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaFrazer" /&gt; The gods transformed Procne into a [[Swallow (bird)|swallow]] and Philomela into a [[nightingale]].&lt;ref name="OvidPhilomela" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note though that earlier Greek accounts say the opposite (Procne as the nightingale, the "tongueless" Philomela as the silent swallow) and are more consistent with the facts of the myth. Frazer in his translation of the ''Bibliotheca'' [Frazer, Sir James George (translator/editor). Apollodorus, ''Library'' in 2 volumes (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press; London: William Heinemann, Ltd., 1921), in note 2 to section 3.14.8] comments that the Roman mythographers "somewhat absurdly inverted the transformation of the two sisters."&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the gods would transform Tereus into a [[hoopoe]].&lt;ref name="BibliothecaFrazer" /&gt;

===Variations on the myth===

It is typical for myths from antiquity to have been altered over the passage of time or for competing variations of the myth to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Magoulick, Mary (folklorist and Professor of English &amp; Interdisciplinary Studies at Georgia College &amp; State University).

"The Problem of Defining Myth" in Dundes, Alan (editor) ''Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984), 41-52.&lt;/ref&gt; With the story of Philomela, most of the variations concern which sister became the nightingale or the swallow, and into what type of bird Tereus was transformed. Since Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', it has been generally accepted that Procne was transformed into a nightingale, and Philomela into a swallow.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaFrazer" /&gt; The description of Tereus as an "epops" has generally been translated as a hoopoe (scientific name: ''Upupa epops'').&lt;ref name="ArrowsmithAristophanes"&gt;Arrowsmith, William (editor).

Retrieved 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Since many of the earlier sources are no longer extant, or remain only fragments, Ovid's version of the myth has been the most lasting and influenced most later works.

Early Greek sources have it that Philomela was turned into a swallow, which has no song; Procne turns into a nightingale, singing a beautiful but sad song in remorse.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaFrazer" /&gt; Later sources, among them Ovid, [[Hyginus]], and the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus, and in modern literature the English romantic poets like [[John Keats|Keats]] write that although she was tongueless, Philomela was turned into a nightingale, and Procne into a swallow.&lt;ref name="BibliothecaFrazer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FieldsKeatsTongueless"&gt;Fields, Beverly. "Keats and the Tongueless Nightingale: Some Unheard Melodies in 'The Eve of Saint Agnes'". ''Wordsworth Circle'' 19 (1983), 246–250.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]]' version of the story has the sisters reversed, so that Philomela married Tereus and that Tereus lusted after Procne.&lt;ref&gt;For the comparison between Homer's version and Eusthathius' version of the myth, see: [https://books.google.com/books?id=SyAOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Notes to Book XIX (regarding line 605&amp;c.)] in Pope, Alexander. ''The Odyssey of Homer, translated by A. Pope'', Volume V. (London: F. J. DuRoveray, 1806), 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is salient to note that in [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and [[binomial nomenclature]], the [[genus]] name of the martins (the larger-bodied among swallow genera) is ''[[Progne]]'', a Latinized form of Procne. Other related genera named after the myth include the Crag Martins ''[[Ptyonoprogne]]'', and Saw-wings ''[[Psalidoprocne]]''. Coincidentally, although most of the depictions of the nightingale and its song in art and literature are of female nightingales, the female of the species does not sing—it is the male of the species who sings its characteristic song.&lt;ref name="birdsong1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="birdsong2" /&gt;

In an early account, [[Sophocles]] wrote that Tereus was turned into a large-beaked bird whom some scholars translate as a [[hawk]]&lt;ref name="FitzgeraldSophTereus" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halmamann, Carolin. "Sophoclean Fragments" in Ormand, Kirk (editor). ''A Companion to Sophocles''. (Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2012), 175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyginus"&gt;compare with the "hawk" in Hyginus (Gaius Julius Hyginus ). ''Fabulae'', 45. Hyginus based his interpretation on [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aesch._Supp._60&amp;lang=original Aesch.Supp.60] from 
Smyth, Herbert Weir (translator); Aeschylus. ''Aeschylus, with an English translation by Herbert Weir Smyth, Ph. D. in two volumes.'' in ''Volume 2. Suppliant Women.'' (Cambridge, MA. Harvard University Press. 1926).&lt;/ref&gt; while a number of retellings and other works (including [[Aristophanes]]' ancient comedy, ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'') hold that Tereus was instead changed into a hoopoe.&lt;ref name="ArrowsmithAristophanes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeLucaDeconstrTereus" /&gt; Various later translations of Ovid state that Tereus was transformed into other birds than the hawk and hoopoe, including references by Dryden and Gower to the [[lapwing]].&lt;ref name="OvidDrydenGarth1717" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gower, John. ''Confessio Amantis'' Book V, Lines 6041–6046, refer to a "lappewincke" or "lappewinge"&lt;/ref&gt;

Several writers omit key details of the story. According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], Tereus was so remorseful for his actions against Philomela and Itys (the nature of the actions is not described) that he kills himself. Then two birds appear as the women lament his death.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 1:41 section 8 and 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Many later sources omit the Tereus' tongue-cutting mutilation of Philomela altogether.&lt;ref&gt;According to Delany, Chaucer barely mentions it and the Chretien de Troyes omits the "grotesquerie" entirely. Delany, Sheila. ''The Naked Text: Chaucer's Legend Of Good Women''. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994), 216-217, and passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thucydides]], Tereus was not King of Thrace, but rather from the city of [[Daulia]] in [[Phocis]], a city inhabited by Thracians. He cites in proof of this that poets who mention the nightingale refer to it as a "Daulian bird."&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. ''History of the Peloponnesian War''. 2.29. In the version translated by Thomas Hobbes (London: Bohn, 1843). (found online [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.2.29&amp;lang=original here] – retrieved 23 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that Thucydides commented on the myth in his famous work on the [[Peloponnesian War]] because Sophocles' play confused the mythical Tereus with contemporary ruler [[Teres I]] of Thrace.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Thomas B. L. ''An Introduction to Sophocles'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1936), 3, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elements borrowed from other myths and stories===
The story of Philomela, Procne and Tereus is largely influenced by the lost tragedy ''Tereus'' of Sophocles. Scholar Jenny Marsh claims that Sophocles borrowed certain plot elements from [[Euripides]] drama ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]''—notably a wife killing her child in an act of revenge against her husband—and incorporated them in his tragedy ''Tereus''. She implies that the infanticide of Itys did not appear in the Tereus myth until Sophocles' play and that it was introduced because of what was borrowed from Euripides.&lt;ref name="MarshVases"&gt;Marsh, Jenny. "Vases and Tragic Drama" in Rutter, N.K. and Sparkes, B.A. (editors) ''Word and Image in Ancient Greece'' (Edinburgh: University of Edinburgh, 2000) 121–123, 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that social and political themes have woven their way into the story as a contrast between Athenians who believed themselves to be the hegemonic power in Greece and the more civilized of the Greek peoples, and the Thracians who were considered to be a "barbaric race."&lt;ref name="LloydFragments" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickTereus" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, A. P. ''Revenge in Attic and later tragedy'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998) 180–189.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that these elements were woven into Sophocles' play ''Tereus'' and other works of the period.

==Appearances in the Western canon==
The material of the Philomela myth has been used in various creative works—artistic and literary—for the past 2,500 years.&lt;ref&gt;Salisury, Joyce E. ''Women in the Ancient World'' (ABC-CLIO, 2001), 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChandlerPoetry"&gt;Chandler, Albert R. "The Nightingale in Greek and Latin Poetry," in ''The Classic Journal'' XXX:2:78–84 (The Classical Association of Middle West and South, 1934). (found online [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3289944 here]) (Retrieved 23 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, the myth has been associated with the image of the nightingale and its song described as both exceedingly beautiful and sorrowful. The continued use of the image in artistic, literary, and musical works has reinforced this association.

===From antiquity and the influence of Ovid===
[[File:Philomela Procne preparing to kill Itys.jpg|thumb|300px|Image from an Attic wine cup, circa 490 BC, depicting Philomela and Procne preparing to kill Itys. (Musée du Louvre, Paris)]]
Beginning with [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''The Odyssey'' Book XIX, lines 518–523.&lt;/ref&gt; ancient dramatists and poets evoked the story of Philomela and the nightingale in their works.&lt;ref name="ChandlerPoetry" /&gt; Most notably, it was the core of the tragedy ''[[Tereus (Sophocles)|Tereus]]'' by [[Sophocles]] (lost, extant only in fragments), and later in a set of plays by [[Philocles]], the nephew of the great playwright [[Aeschylus]]. In Aeschylus's ''[[Agamemnon]]'', the prophetess [[Cassandra]] has a visionary premonition of her own death in which she mentioned the nightingale and Itys, lamenting:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ah for thy fate, O shrill-voiced nightingale!
Some solace for thy woes did Heaven afford,
Clothed thee with soft brown plumes, and life apart from wail(ing)—&lt;ref&gt;Aeschylus, ''Agamemnon" (found online [http://www.greektexts.com/library/Aeschylus/Agamemnon/eng/print/25.html here]). (Retrieved 23 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] points to the ″voice of the shuttle″ in [[Sophocles]]′ tragedy ''Tereus'' as an example of a poetic device that aids in the ″recognition″—the change from ignorance to knowledge—of what has happened earlier in the plot. Such a device, according to Aristotle, is ″contrived″ by the poet, and thus is ″inartistic.″.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Poetics, 54b.&lt;/ref&gt; The connection between the nightingale's song and poetry is evoked by [[Aristophanes]] in his comedy ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' and in the poetry of [[Callimachus]]. Roman poet [[Virgil]] compares the mourning of [[Orpheus]] for Eurydice to the “lament of the nightingale”.&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, Frank.

While Ovid's retelling of the myth is the more famous version of the story, he had several ancient sources on which to rely before he finished the Metamorphoses in A.D. 8.&lt;ref name="FrazerBiblioNote2" /&gt; Many of these sources were doubtless available to Ovid during his lifetime but have been lost or come to us at present only in fragments. In his version, Ovid recast and combined many elements from these ancient sources. Because his is the most complete, lasting version of the myth, it is the basis for many later works.

In the 12th century, French [[trouvère]] (troubadour) [[Chrétien de Troyes]]&lt;!-- it's still under debate if Chrétien was truly the author of Philomela, this should be noted. Here the reference, one of many possible ones: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/831/831-h/831-h.htm --&gt;, adapted many of the myths recounted in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' into [[Old French]]. However, de Troyes was not alone in making use of Ovid's material. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] recounted the story in his unfinished work ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]''&lt;ref&gt;Gila Aloni, "Palimpsestic Philomela: Reinscription in Chaucer's 'Legend of Good Women'", in ''Palimpsests and the Literary Imagination of Medieval England'', eds. Leo Carruthers, Raeleen Chai-Elsholz, Tatjana Silec. New York: Palgrave, 2011. 157–73.&lt;/ref&gt; and briefly alluded to the myth in his ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chaucer, Geoffrey. ''Troilus and Criseyde'' Book II, lines 64–70.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gower]] included the tale in his ''[[Confessio Amantis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, John. ''Confessio Amantis'' Book VIII, lines 5545 - 6075.&lt;/ref&gt; References to Philomela are common in the [[motet]]s of the [[ars nova]], [[ars subtilior]], and ars mutandi musical eras of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Eva Leach]], ''Sung Birds: Music, Nature, and Poetry in the Later Middle Ages'' (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Elizabethean and Jacobean England===
Throughout the late Renaissance and Elizabethean eras, the image of Philomela and the nightingale incorporated elements of mourning and beauty after being subjected to an act of [[violence]]. In the long poem "The Steele Glas" (1576), poet [[George Gascoigne]] (1535–1577) depicts "Philomel" as the representative of poetry (Poesys), her sister Progne as satire (Satyra), and Tereus as "vayne Delight."&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Rebecca. ''Behind the Arras: Tapestry Ekphrasis in Spenser and Shakespeare'' (ProQuest, 2008), 164&lt;/ref&gt; The characterization of Philomela and the nightingale was that of a woman choosing to exercise her will in recovering her voice and resisting those forces which attempts to silence her. Critics have pointed to Gascoigne's use of the Philomela myth as a personal appeal and that he was fighting in verse a battle with his enemies who violently opposed his poems.&lt;ref&gt;Maslen, R. W. “Myths Exploited: the Metamorphoses of Ovid in Early Elizabethan England” in Taylor, A. B. (editor). ''Shakespeare’s Ovid: The Metamorphoses in the Plays and Poems''. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Diana E. ''Passion Made Public: Elizabethan Lyric, Gender, and Performance''. (University of Illinois Press, 1995), 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; In his poem "The complaynt of Philomene" (1576), the myth is employed to depict punishment and control.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Lynette, and Lichtenfels, Peter. ''Negotiating Shakespeare's Language in Romeo and Juliet: Reading Strategies from Criticism, Editing and the Theatre''. (Farnham, England and Burlington, Vermont: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2009), 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd]]", Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] (1554–1618) relays consolation regarding the [[nymph]]'s harsh rejection of the shepherd's romantic advances in the spirit of "time heals all wounds," by citing in the second stanza (among several examples) that eventually with the passage of time Philomel would become "dumb" to her own pain and that her attention would be drawn away from the pain by the events of life to come.&lt;ref&gt;Lourenco, Alexander. [http://www.helum.com/items/879551-poetry-analysis-the-nymphs-reply-to-the-shepherd-by-william-raleigh Poetry analysis: The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd, by William Raleigh] (''sic''). Retrieved 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raleigh, Sir Walter "The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd" (1600), lines 5-8: "Time drives the flocks from field to fold / When rivers rage and rocks grow cold, / And Philomel becometh dumb; / The rest complains of cares to come."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sir [[Philip Sidney]]'s (1554–1586) [[courtly love]] poem "The Nightingale", Sydney's narrator who is in love with a woman he cannot have compares his own romantic situation to that of Philomela's plight and claims that he has more reason to be sad. However, recent literary criticism has labelled this claim as [[Sexism|sexist]] and an unfortunate marginalization of the traumatic rape of Philomela. Sydney argues that the rape was an "excess of love" and less severe than being deprived of love as attested by the line, "Since wanting is more woe than too much having."&lt;ref&gt;Addison, Catherine. "‘Darkling I Listen’: The Nightingale’s Song In and Out of Poetry". ''[http://alternation.ukzn.ac.za/docs/16.2/13%20Addison%20F.PDF Alternation'' 16:2 (2009) 190–220], at 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Playwright and poet [[William Shakespeare]] (1564–1616) makes frequent use of the Philomela myth—most notably in his tragedy ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' (c. 1588–1593) where characters directly reference Tereus and Philomela in commenting on rape and mutilation of Lavinia by Aaron, Chiron, and Demetrius.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley-Brown, Liz. ''Ovid And the Cultural Politics of Translation in Early Modern England''. (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing, 2006), 26-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent allusions to Philomela also occur in the depiction of Lucrece in ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'',&lt;ref&gt;See: Newman, Jane O. "'And Let Mild Women to Him Lose Their Mildness': Philomela, Female Violence, and Shakespeare's The Rape of Lucrece" ''Shakespeare Quarterly'' Vol. 45, No. 3 (Autumn, 1994), 304-326.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Patrick (editor). ''The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's Poetry''. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), 94-95, 105, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; in the depiction of Imogen in ''[[Cymbeline]],''&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William. "Cymbeline", Act II, Scene ii, and Act III, Scene iv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Theresa D. ''Women in the Age of Shakespeare'' (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2010), 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Titania]]'s lullaby in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' where she asks Philomel to "sing in our sweet lullaby".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Nicole. [http://www.articlemyriad.com/significance-philomel-midsummer-nights-dream/ "The Significance of the Reference to Philomel in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” by Shakespeare"] (4 December 2011). Retrieved 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sonnet 102]], Shakespeare addresses his lover (the "fair youth") and compares his love poetry to the song of the nightingale, noting that "her mournful hymns did hush the night" (line 10), and that as a poet would "hold his tongue" (line 13) in deference to the more beautiful nightingale's song so that he "not dull you with my song" (line 14).&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Patrick. ''Shakespeare, National Poet-Playwright''. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 235-236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luckyj, Christina. ''"A Moving Rhetoricke": Gender and Silence in Early Modern England''. (New York: Palgrave, 2002), 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Patricia A. ''Shakespeare and the Question of Theory'' (New York: Methuen, 1985), 97.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emilia Lanyer]] (1569–1645), a poet who is considered by some scholars to be the woman referred to in the poetry of William Shakespeare as "[[The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]]", makes several references to Philomela in her patronage poem "The Description of Cookeham" in ''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum'' (1611). Lanyer's poem, dedicated to [[Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland]] and her daughter [[Lady Anne Clifford]] refers to Philomela's "sundry layes"(line 31) and later to her "mournful ditty" (line 189).&lt;ref&gt;Lanyer, Emilia. "The Description of Cookeham" in ''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum'' (1611).&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of the nightingale appears frequently in poetry of the period with it and its song described by poets as an example of "joyance" and gaiety or as an example of melancholy, sad, sorrowful, and mourning. However, many use the nightingale as a symbol of sorrow but without a direct reference to the Philomela myth.&lt;ref&gt;Addison cites examples including William Drummond of Hawthornden, Charlotte Smith and Robert Southey, Mary Robinson. However, cites later examples like Robert Bridges where an indirect reference to the myth may be called a "dark nocturnal secret"; in Addison, Catherine. "‘Darkling I Listen’: The Nightingale’s Song In and Out of Poetry". ''Alternation'' 16:2 (2009) 190–220&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Classical and Romantic works===
[[File:Tereo.jpg|thumb|300px|''Tereus Confronted with the Head of his Son Itylus'' (oil on canvas, painted 1636–1638), one of the late works of Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens (1577–1640) (Prado Museum in Madrid, Spain)]]
Poets in the [[Romanticism|Romantic Era]] recast the myth and adapted the image of the nightingale with its song to be a poet and “master of a superior art that could inspire the human poet”.&lt;ref&gt;Shippey, Thomas. "Listening to the Nightingale" in ''Comparative Literature'' XXII:1 (1970), 46–60 (found online [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1769299 here] – retrieved 24 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, Frank. "Romanticism's Singing Bird" in ''Studies in English Literature 1500–1900'' XIV:4 (1974), 570 (found online [https://www.jstor.org/stable/449753 here] – retrieved 24 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; For some romantic poets, the nightingale even began to take on qualities of the muse. [[John Keats]] (1795–1821), in "[[Ode to a Nightingale]]" (1819) idealizes the nightingale as a poet who has achieved the poetry that Keats himself longs to write.  Keats directly employs the Philomel myth in "[[The Eve of St. Agnes]]" (1820) where the rape of Madeline by Porphyro mirrors the rape of Philomela by Tereus.&lt;ref name="FieldsKeatsTongueless" /&gt; Keats' contemporary, poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] (1792–1822) invoked a similar image of the nightingale, writing in his ''[[A Defence of Poetry]]'' that "a poet is a nightingale who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds; his auditors are as men entranced by the melody of an unseen musician, who feel that they are moved and softened, yet know not whence or why.”&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, Percy Bysshe. ''A Defense of Poetry'' (Boston: Ginn &amp; Company, 1903), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, ''[[Philomèle]]'' was an [[French opera|operatic]] stage production of the story, produced by [[Louis Lacoste (composer)|Louis Lacoste]] during the reign of [[Louis XIV]].

First published in the collection ''Lyrical Ballads'', "The Nightingale" (1798) is an effort by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] (1772–1834) to move away from associations that the nightingale's song was one of melancholy and identified it with the joyous experience of nature. He remarked that "in nature there is nothing melancholy," (line 15) expressing hope "we may not thus profane / Nature’s sweet voices, always full of love / And joyance!" (lines 40–42).&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, Rosemary. ''The Life of Samuel Taylor Coleridge''. (Oxford: Blackwell, 1997), 136-139; Mays, J. C. C. (editor). ''The Collected Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge: Poetical Works I'' (Volume I). (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001), 518.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the poem's conclusion, Coleridge writes of a father taking his crying son outside in the night:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
And he beheld the moon, and, hushed at once,
Suspends his sobs, and laughs most silently,
While his fair eyes, that swam with undropped tears,'
Did glitter in the yellow moon-beam! Well!—
It is a father’s tale: But if that Heaven
Should give me life, his childhood shall grow up
Familiar with these songs, that with the night
He may associate joy.—&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. "Philomela" (1798), lines 102–109 in Volume I of ''Lyrical Ballads with a few other poems'' (with William Wordsworth) (London: J. &amp; A. Arch, 1798)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Coleridge, and his friend William Wordsworth (1770–1850) who called the nightingale a "fiery heart,"&lt;ref&gt;Wordsworth, William. "O Nightingale, thou surely art" (1807), line 2.&lt;/ref&gt; depicted the bird "as an instance of natural poetic creation," and as the "voice of nature."&lt;ref&gt;Rana, Sujata; Dhankhar, Pooja. [http://www.languageinindia.com/dec2011/sujatabirdimagery.pdf "Bird Imagery in Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale” and Yeats’s “The Wild Swans at Coole”: A Comparative Study"] in ''Language in India'' Volume 11 (12 December 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable mentions include:
* In [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s 1847–8 [[serial novel|serial]] ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'', [[Becky Sharp (character)|Becky Sharp]] performs [[charades]] of [[Clytemnestra]] (kingslayer) and Philomela (the ravished mute of king, who prompted his slaying) before the [[George IV of England|Prince Regent]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]]. Further, her performance of Philomela is styled after [[Philomèle|the play]] from the era of [[Louis XIV]], alluding to the possibility of her becoming another [[Marquise de Maintenon]].
* In the poem "Philomela" (1853) by English poet [[Matthew Arnold]] (1822–1888), the poet asks upon hearing the crying of a fleeing nightingale if it can find peace and healing in the English countryside far away from Greece, although lamenting its pain and passion "eternal."
* In his 1881 poem "[[s:The Burden of Itys|The Burden of Itys]]", [[Oscar Wilde]] describes Itys as the symbol of Greek art and pleasure is contrasted with Christ. The landscape of Greece is also compared to the landscape of England, specifically Kent and Oxford. 
* [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] (1837–1909) wrote a poem called "Itylus" based on the story in which Philomela and Procne, after being transformed into the nightingale and swallow, ask when they will be able to forget the grief of having slain Itylus—the answer being they will forget when the world ends.
* English poet [[Ann Yearsley]] (1753–1806) in lamenting the sufferings of African slaves invokes the myth and challenges that her song "''shall teach sad Philomel a louder note,''" in her abolitionist poem "A Poem on the Inhumanity of the Slave-Trade" (1788)&lt;ref&gt;Yearsley, Ann. "A Poem on the Inhumanity of the Slave-Trade" (1788) lines 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In "A la Juventud Filipina", Filipino national hero [[José Rizal]] (1861–1896), used the image of Philomel as inspiration for young Filipinos to use their voices to speak of Spanish injustice and colonial oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Zaide, Gregorio. ''Jose Rizal: Life, Works, and Writings of a Genius, Writer, Scientist, and National Hero'' (Manila, Philippines: All Nations Publishing Co., 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern works===
[[File:Thomas Stearns Eliot by Lady Ottoline Morrell (1934).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Poet T. S. Eliot's poem "The Waste Land", published in 1922, incorporates elements of the Philomela myth]]
The Philomela myth is perpetuated largely through its appearance as a powerful device in poetry. In the 20th century, American-British poet [[T. S. Eliot]] (1888–1965) directly referenced the myth in his most famous poem, "[[The Waste Land]]" (1922), where he describes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king
So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale
Filled all the desert with inviolable voice
And still she cried, and still the world pursues,
"Jug Jug" to dirty ears.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T(homas) S(tearns). "The Waste Land" (New York: Horace Liveright, 1922), lines 98–103. See also lines 203–206, 428.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Eliot employs the myth to depict themes of sorrow, pain, and that the only recovery or regeneration possible is through revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Donnell, Sean M. [http://www.elcamino.edu/faculty/sdonnell/waste_land.htm Notes on T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land] (retrieved 24 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these mentions reference other poets' renderings of the myth, including those of Ovid and Gascoigne. Eliot's references to the nightingales singing by the convent in "Sweeney and the Nightingales" (1919–1920) is a direct reference the murder of [[Agamemnon]] in the tragedy by Aeschylus—wherein the Greek dramatist directly evoked the Philomela myth. The poem describes Sweeney as a brute and that two women in the poem are conspiring against him for his mistreatment of them. This mirrors not only the elements of Agamemnon's death in Aeschylus' play but the sister's revenge against Tereus in the myth.

In the poem "To the Nightingale", Argentine poet and fabulist, [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (1899–1986), who compares his efforts as a poet to the bird's lament though never having heard it. He describes its song as "encrusted with mythology" and that the evolution of the myth has distorted it—that the opinions of other poets and writers have kept both poet and reader from actually hearing the original sound and knowing the essence of the song.

Several artists have applied Ovid's account to new translations or reworkings, or adapted the story for the stage. British poet [[Ted Hughes]] (1930–1998) used the myth in his 1997 work ''[[Tales from Ovid]]'' (1997) which was a loose translation and retelling of twenty-four tales from Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''. Both Israeli dramatist [[Hanoch Levin]] (in ''The Great Whore of Babylon'') and English playwright [[Joanna Laurens]] (in ''The Three Birds'') wrote plays based on the story. Most recently the story was adapted into an opera by Scottish composer [[James Dillon (composer)|James Dillon]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;Stating that it was adapted from Sophocles, Thales, Eva Hesse, R. Buckminster Fuller, see [http://composers21.com/compdocs/dillonj.htm The Living Composers Project: James Dillon]. (Retrieved 22 December 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1964 [[Philomel (Babbitt)|vocal composition]] by American composer [[Milton Babbitt]]&lt;ref&gt;Hair, Graham, and Stephen Arnold. "Some Works of Milton Babbitt, Reviewed", ''Tempo'' new series, no. 90 (1969): 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; with text by [[John Hollander]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, John. "A Poem for Music: Remarks on the Composition of ''Philomel''", pp. 289–306 in ''Vision and Resonance: Two Senses of Poetic Form'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several female writers have used the Philomela myth as a vehicle for exploring the subject of rape, women and power ([[Empowerment#Empowerment of women|empowerment]]), and [[Feminism|feminist]] themes, including novelist [[Margaret Atwood]] in her novella ''Nightingale'' published in ''The Tent'' (2006), [[Emma Tennant]] in her story "Philomela", [[Jeannine Hall Gailey]] who uses the myth in several poems published in ''[[Becoming the Villainess]]'' (2006), and [[Timberlake Wertenbaker]] in her play ''[[The Love of the Nightingale]]'' (1989) (later adapted into an [[The Love of the Nightingale (opera)|opera of the same name]] composed by [[Richard Mills (composer)|Richard Mills]]).

'''Planographic printing''' means printing from a flat surface, as opposed to a raised surface (as with [[relief print]]ing) or incised surface (as with [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing).  [[Lithograph]]y and [[offset printing|offset lithography]] are planographic processes that rely on the property that water will not mix with oil. The image is created by applying a [[:wiktionary:tusche|tusche]] (greasy substance) to a  plate or stone. (The term lithography comes from ''litho'', for ''stone'', and -''graph'' to draw.) Certain parts of the semi-absorbent surface being printed on can be made receptive to ink while others (the blank parts) reject it.

'''Poetry analysis''' is the process of investigating a poem's form, content, structural semiotics and history in an informed way, with the aim of heightening one's own and others' understanding and appreciation of the work.

The words ''poem''&lt;!--Poem redirects to Poetry--&gt; and ''[[poetry]]'' derive from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''poiēma'' (to make) and ''poieo'' (to create). That is, a poem is a ''made thing''&lt;!--this slightly awkward phrase is used for emphasis--&gt;: a creation; an artifact. One might think of a poem as, in the words of [[William Carlos Williams]],{{Full citation needed|date=April 2016}} a "machine made of words". [[Machine]]s produce some effect, or do some work. They do whatever they are designed to do. The work done by this "machine made of words" is the effect it produces in the reader's mind. A reader analyzing a poem is akin to a mechanic taking apart a machine in order to figure out how it works.

Like poetry itself, poetry analysis can take many forms, and be undertaken for many different reasons. A teacher might analyze a poem in order to gain a more conscious understanding of how the poem achieves its effects, in order to communicate this to his or her students. A writer learning the craft of poetry might use the tools of poetry analysis to expand and strengthen his or her own mastery.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} A reader might use the tools and techniques of poetry analysis in order to discern all that the work has to offer, and thereby gain a fuller, more rewarding appreciation of the poem.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Overview==

==="The Destruction of Sennacherib", by Lord Byron===
Similarly, one can derive pleasure&lt;ref&gt;Louise Bogan, 'The Pleasures of Formal Poetry', in Reginald Gibbons (ed.), ''The Poet’s Work: 29 Poets On The Origins And Practice Of Their Art'' (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1979) {{ISBN|978-0-395-27616-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; from two of the most fundamental tools in the poet's toolbox—[[Meter (poetry)|meter]] and [[rhyme]]—without necessarily knowing a lot of terminology, as in this, the first [[stanza]] of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]]'s "The Destruction of Sennacherib":

:The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
:And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
:And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
:When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.

Byron's use of meter and rhyme is especially evident and rewarding when one reads the lines out loud. The lines have a powerful, rolling, and very evident rhythm, and they rhyme in a way that is impossible to ignore. In other words, the ''physicality'' of the language—how it sounds and feels—accounts for a large measure of the poem's effect. The poem does not have a deep, hidden, [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolic]] meaning. Rather, it is simply pleasurable to read, say, and hear.

Critical terminology becomes useful when one attempts to account for ''why'' the language is pleasurable, and ''how'' Byron achieved this effect. The lines are not simply rhythmic: the rhythm is regular within a line, and is the same for each line. A poem having a regular rhythm (not all poems do) is said to follow a certain [[meter (poetry)|meter]]. In "The Destruction of Sennacherib", each line has the basic pattern of two unstressed syllables followed by a third stressed syllable, with this basic pattern being repeated four times in a line. Those basic patterns are called [[Foot (prosody)|feet]], and this particular pattern (weak weak STRONG) is called an [[anapest]]. A line with four feet is said to be in [[tetrameter]] (''[[Wiktionary:tetra-|tetra-]]'', from the Greek for four). This poem has a pleasurable and appropriate rhythm, and that rhythm has a name: this poem is written in ''anapestic tetrameter''. (This process of analyzing a poem's rhythms is called [[Meter (poetry)|scansion]].) The poem also rhymes (not all poems do), and the rhymes follow a pattern (they do not have to). In this case, the rhymes come right next to each other, which emphasizes them, and therefore emphasizes the sound, the physical nature, of the language. The effect of the poem's language derives in part from Byron's choice of an appropriate pattern of rhyme (or [[rhyme scheme]]): these adjacent, rhyming lines are called [[couplet]]s. The sound, the physical nature, of the language is also emphasized by [[alliteration]], as in the repetition of ''s'' sounds in the third line: "And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea".

===Poetic forms===
Poems can have many forms. Some forms are strictly defined, with required line counts and rhyming patterns, such as the [[sonnet]] or [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]]. Such poems exhibit closed form.{{Clarify|date=April 2016}}&lt;!--What does this mean?--&gt; Others (which exhibit [[Open Form|open form]]) have less structure or, indeed, almost no apparent structure at all. This appearance, though, is deceptive: successful open form poems are informed throughout by organic structure which may resist formal description but is nonetheless a crucial element of the poem's effect on the reading mind.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Closed forms====
A poet writing in closed form follows a specific pattern, a specific design. Some designs have proven so durable and so suited to the [[English language]] that they survive for centuries and are renewed with each generation of poets ([[sonnet]]s, [[sestina]]s, [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], and so forth), while others come into being for the expression of one poem and are then set aside ([[Robert Frost|Frost's]] "[[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening]]" is a good example).{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Of all closed forms in English prosody, none has demonstrated greater durability and range of expression than '''[[blank verse]]''', which is [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] that follows a regular meter but does not rhyme. In English, iambic pentameter is by far the most frequently employed meter. Among the many exemplary works of blank verse in English are [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' and most of the verse passages from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays, such as this portion of a famous [[soliloquy]] from [[Hamlet]]:

:To be, or not to be—that is the question.
:Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
:The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
:Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
:And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep —
:No more, and by a sleep to say we end
:The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
:That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
:Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
:To sleep—perchance to dream. Aye, there's the rub.

Note that Shakespeare does not rigidly follow a pattern of five iambs per line. Rather, most lines have five strong syllables, and most are preceded by a weak syllable. The meter provides a rhythm that informs the line: it is not an invariable formula.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Rhymed pairs of iambic pentameter lines form the '''[[heroic couplet]]'''. Two masters of the form are [[Alexander Pope]] and [[John Dryden]]. The form has proven especially suited to conveying wit and sardonic humor, as in the opening of Pope's ''An Essay on Criticism''.

:’Tis hard to say, if greater want of skill
:Appear in writing or in judging ill;
:But, of the two, less dang’rous is th’ offence,
:To tire our patience, than mislead our sense.
:Some few in that, but numbers err in this,
:Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss;
:A fool might once himself alone expose,
:Now one in verse makes many more in prose.

Fourteen lines of iambic pentameter arranged in a more elaborate rhyme scheme form a '''[[sonnet]]'''. There are two major variants. The form originated in [[Italy]], and the word derives from "sonetto", which is [[Italian language|Italian]] for "little song". The [[Italian sonnet]] or [[Petrarchan sonnet]] follows a rhyme scheme of ABBA ABBA CDE CDE, ABBA ABBA CD CD CD, ABBA ABBA CCE DDE, or ABBA ABBA CDD CEE. In each of these, a group of eight lines (the [[Octave (poetry)|octave]]) is followed by a group of six (the [[sextet]]). Typically, the octave introduces a situation, idea, or problem to which the sestet provides a response or resolution. For example, consider [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s "The Sound of the Sea":

:The sea awoke at midnight from its sleep,
:And round the pebbly beaches far and wide
:I heard the first wave of the rising tide
:Rush onward with uninterrupted sweep;
:A voice out of the silence of the deep,
:A sound mysteriously multiplied
:As of a cataract from the mountain's side,
:Or roar of winds upon a wooded steep.
:So comes to us at times, from the unknown
:And inaccessible solitudes of being,
:The rushing of the sea-tides of the soul;
:And inspirations, that we deem our own,
:Are some divine foreshadowing and foreseeing
:Of things beyond our reason or control.

The octave presents the speaker's experience of the sound of the sea, coming to him from some distance. In the sestet, this experience mutates into a meditation on the nature of inspiration and man's connection to creation and his experience of the numinous.

English has (proportionally) far fewer rhyming words than Italian.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Recognizing this, Shakespeare adapted the sonnet form to English by creating an alternate rhyme scheme: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. The poet using this, the [[English sonnet]] or [[Shakespearean sonnet]] form, may use the fourteen lines as single unit of thought (as in "The Silken Tent" above), or treat the groups of four rhyming lines (the [[quatrains]]) as organizational units, as in Shakespeare's Sonnet 73:

:That time of year thou mayst in me behold
:When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang
:Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
:Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.
:In me thou seest the twilight of such day
:As after sunset fadeth in the west,
:Which by and by black night doth steal away,
:Death's second self, which seals up all in rest.
:In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
:That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
:As the deathbed whereon it must expire,
:Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
:This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
:To love that well which thou must leave ere long.

In lines 1–4, the speaker compares his time of life to autumn. In lines 5–8, the comparison is to twilight; in lines 9–12, the comparison is to the last moments of a dying fire. Each quatrain presents a shorter unit of time, creating a sense of time accelerating toward an inevitable end, the death implied in the final couplet.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

At the "high end" of closed forms are the '''[[sestina]]''' and '''[[villanelle]]'''. At the "low end" are forms such as the '''[[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]''', which follows a metrical pattern of two lines of anapestic trimeter (three anapests per line), followed by two lines of anapestic dimeter (two anapests per line), followed by one line of anapestic trimeter. (The beginning of the metrical foot does not have to coincide with the beginning of the line.) Any poem following this metrical pattern would generally be considered a limerick, however most also follow an AABBA rhyme scheme. Most limericks are humorous, and many are ribald, or outright obscene (possible rhymes that could follow an opening like "[[There once was a man from Nantucket]]" are left as an exercise for the reader). Nonetheless, the form is capable of sophisticated and playful expression:

:Titian was mixing rose madder.
:His model posed nude on a ladder.
::Her position to Titian
::Suggested coition
:So he nipped up the ladder and had her.

==== Open forms ====
In contrast, a poet using '''[[free verse]]''' (sometimes called "[[Open Form|open form]]"){{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} seeks to find fresh and uniquely appropriate forms for each poem, letting the structure grow out of the poem's subject matter or inspiration. A common perception is that open form is easier and less rigorous than closed form ([[Frost]] likened it to "playing tennis with the net down"&lt;ref&gt;Address at Milton Academy, Massachusetts (17 May 1935){{Full citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;!--I must have missed that event--is it published somewhere?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
, but such is not necessarily the case (skeptics should ''try'' playing tennis without a net): success with the open form requires great sensitivity to language and a particular type of adaptable understanding. In the best open form poems, the poet achieves something that is inaccessible through closed form. As X. J. Kennedy has said, "Should the poet succeed, then the discovered arrangement will seem exactly right for what the poem is saying" (582). The metre of ‘classical’ poetry is replaced in open verse by [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] in rhythm, line indentation, with pauses implied by the syntax, thus the limiting factor of one human breath was naturally incorporated in the poetry, essential to an oral art form, composed to be read aloud.&lt;ref&gt;Sounds Aloud http://soundsaloud.blogspot.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walt Whitman]] was an important innovator of open form, and he demonstrates its merits in "[[A Noiseless Patient Spider]]".

:A noiseless patient spider,
:I marked where on a little promontory it stood isolated,
:Marked how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,
:It launched forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,
:Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.

:And you O my soul where you stand,
:Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,
:Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them,
:Till the bridge you will need to be formed, till the ductile anchor hold,
:Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.

The long, rolling lines—unified, held together like strong cords, by [[alliteration]] and [[assonance]]—partake of the same nature as the spider's filaments and the soul's threads. Two balanced stanzas, one describing a spider, the other the speaker's soul, perfectly frame the implicit comparison, with neither being privileged over the other. Just as the spider and the soul quest outward for significance, the two stanzas throw links to each other with subtly paired words: isolated/detached, launched/fling, tirelessly/ceaselessly, surrounding/surrounded.

In this poem, Whitman uses synonyms and antonyms to give structural integrity to a poem comprising two yoked stanzas, much like (but not exactly like) the way poets working within closed forms use meter and rhyme to give structural integrity to their poems. The form works quite well, but there is no established term that describes it. Rather, Whitman created this form so that he could write this poem. Conceivably, other poets could adopt the form, and repeated examples would give literary analysts the material they would need to specify its defining characteristics and give it a name. But, that hasn't happened. Instead, we have one poem that deploys a structure very well suited to its subject. The poem has form, but the form was not imposed by previous conventions. It has open form.{{original research inline|date=April 2016}}

===Imagery and symbolism===
Most poetry can be read on several levels. The surface is not necessarily the essence of the poem although in some cases (notably, the works of [[William McGonagall]]) there is little beyond the immediate. [[Allegory]], [[connotation]] and [[metaphor]] are some of the subtler ways in which a poet communicates with the reader.

Before getting seduced into explorations of subtle nuance, however, the reader should establish the theme of the poem. What is the 'story' that is being told? Not the literal story but the heart of the poem. For example: "Another" tells of a buried child; "The Destruction of Sennacherib" tells of the annihilation of an Assyrian army by divine intervention; "The Silken Tent" compares a woman to a tent. Part of this involves recognising the voice of the poem (who is speaking), and the rest of [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s [[Just So Stories|"six honest serving men"]]: the events in the poem; when these occur; where is the 'speaker' and where do the events occur; why does the speaker speak? [[William Harmon]]{{Full citation needed|date=April 2016}} has suggested that starting an analysis with: "This poem dramatizes the conflict between ..." is a key technique.&lt;!---Verdun---&gt;

[[George Herbert]] in his poem ''Jordan (I)''&lt;ref&gt;Herbert pp. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt; asks if poetry must be about the imaginary. The poem opens:

:Who sayes that fictions onely and false hair
:Become a verse?  Is there in truth no beautie?
:Is all good structure in a winding stair?
:May no lines passe, except they do their dutie
:Not to a true, but painted chair?

He was railing against the prevalent enthusiasm for [[pastoral]] poetry above all other forms (as becomes apparent in subsequent verses). Curiously, this verse uses metaphors to challenge the use of indirect approaches to their subject. False hair and a painted chair are decorations of the mundane. The winding stair is obstructive concealment of meaning. Herbert is criticising the overuse of allegory, symbolism or elaborate language.

For most poets—even the plain-speaking Herbert—metaphor is the fundamental means of communicating complexity succinctly. Some metaphors become so widely used that they are widely recognised symbols and these can be identified by using a specialist dictionary.

Allegorical verse uses an extended metaphor to provide the framework for the whole work. It was particularly prevalent in seventeenth century English but a more recent example is [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]]' ''The Masque of the Manuscript'', in which the process of publishing is a metaphor for the search for truth.&lt;ref&gt;Ingraham&lt;/ref&gt; Allegories are usually readily apparent because of the heavy use of metaphor within them.

The symbolism used in a poem may not always be as overt as metaphor. Often the poet communicates emotionally by selecting words with particular connotations. For example, the word "sheen" in ''The Destruction of Sennacherib'' has stronger connotations of polishing, of human industry, than does the similar "shine". The Assyrians did not simply choose shiny metal; they worked to make it so. The word hints at a military machine.

Other [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] that may be used to increase the level of allusion include [[irony]], [[litotes]], [[simile]], and [[metonymy]] (particularly [[synecdoche]]).

===Meter and rhythm===
English language poetic meter depends on [[lexical stress|stress]], rather than the number of [[syllable]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  It thus stands in contrast to poetry in other languages, such as [[French language|French]], where syllabic stress is not present or recognized and syllable count is paramount. This often makes [[scansion]] (the analysis of metrical patterns) seem unduly arcane and arbitrary to students of the craft.{{Clarify|date=April 2016}}&lt;!--Which, French, or English practice?--&gt;

In the final analysis, the terms of scansion are blunt instruments, clumsy ways of describing the infinitely nuanced rhythms of language. Nonetheless, they provide a tool for discerning and describing the underlying structure of poems (especially those employing closed form).{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The terms fall into two groups: the names of the different feet, and the names of the varying line lengths.

The most common feet in poetry written in English are the [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]] (weak STRONG), the [[anapest]] (weak weak STRONG), the [[trochee]] (STRONG weak), and the [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]] (STRONG weak weak). The iamb and anapest are known as ''rising meters'' (they move "up" from weak to strong syllables); the trochee and dactyl are ''falling meters'' (they move "down" from strong to weak). Less common, but frequently important for the variety and energy they bring to a line, are the [[monosyllabic foot]] (weak) and the [[spondee]] (STRONG STRONG).

The terms for line length follow a regular pattern: a Greek prefix denoting the number of feet and the root "meter" (for "measure"): [[monometer]], [[dimeter]], [[trimeter]], [[tetrameter]], [[pentameter]], [[hexameter]], [[heptameter]], and [[octameter]] (lines having more than eight feet are possible but quite rare).

Another useful term is [[caesura]], for a natural pause within a line.

Meter and line length are not formulas for successful lines of poetry. They are rough forms of notation for the many satisfying and variable rhythms of language. Slavish adherence to meter produces [[doggerel]]. Skillful poets structure their poems around a meter and line length, and then depart from it and play against it as needed in order to create effect, as [[Robert Browning]] does in the first line of "My Last Duchess":

:That's my last Duchess painted on the wall.

The opening spondees, which throw the iambic line out of pattern, gives the Duke's words a certain virulent energy: he's spitting the words out.

[[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] took this idea of poetric energy through departure from meter to its extreme, with his theory and practice of [[sprung rhythm]], an approach to poetry in which the language constantly frustrates the reading mind's expectation of a regular meter.

===Sound, tone, diction, and connotation===
Analyzing diction and connotation—the meanings of words as well as the feelings and associations they carry—is a good place to start for any poem.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The use of specific words in the poem serve to create a [[Tone (literary)|tone]]—an attitude taken towards the subject. For example, consider the words "slither" and "sneak." When used in a poem, the words conjure up images of a snake. The sibilant ''s'' sound reinforces the image. The connotations of the words suggest something surreptitious and undercover. From the tone, one can infer that the author is suspicious or fearful of the subject.

A detached tone, or an opposite tone than the reader would expect, are sometimes purposely employed to elicit more of a response. In the opening lines of "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock", [[T. S. Eliot]] quickly sets a certain tone, and then creates effect by juxtaposing it with a very different tone:

:Let us go then, you and I,
:When the evening is spread out against the sky
:Like a patient etherized upon a table

===Visual and concrete poetry===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Poets such as [[E. E. Cummings]]&lt;!--using the man's own choice of format for his name--&gt; experiment with punctuation and the words' layout on a page. In doing so, they venture into a realm of poetry that really cannot be read aloud: it can only be experienced through the eye.

:l(a

:le
:af
:fa

:ll

:s)
:one
:l

:iness

Cummings has fractured language into its most atomic elements. To analyze the poem, the reader must first reassemble these into meaningful units: a brief, evocative image—"a leaf falls"—appearing, like an unbidden thought, in the middle of a word, "loneliness". A single falling leaf is by itself a fine image for the feeling of loneliness, but in order to fully experience the poem, the reader must then put the elements of language back into the visual form in which Cummings arranged them: a vertical line (like a leaf falling to the ground), followed by a horizontal series of letters (like a leaf laying flat on the ground). The vertical line is dominated by the word "one" (an absolutely appropriate expression of loneliness) and by the letter "l" (which, on the page, looks like the numeral 1... it looks like "one").

Numerous other poets, including [[George Herbert]], [[Lewis Carroll]], [[William Blake]], [[Wyndham Lewis]], and [[John Hollander]] have used the layout of words, letters, and images on the page to create effect in their poems. An analytic reader of poetry must attend to the eye as well as the ear and the mind.

==Approaches==

===Schools of poetry===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
{{main|List of poetry groups and movements}}

There are many different 'schools' of poetry: oral, classical, romantic, modernist, etc. and they each vary in their use of the elements described above.

Schools of poetry may be self-identified by the poets that form them (such as [[Imagism]]), or defined by critics who see unifying characteristics of a body of work by more than one poet (for example [[Movement (literature)|The Movement]]). To be a 'school' a group of poets must share a common style or a common ethos. A commonality of form is not in itself sufficient to define a school; for example, [[Edward Lear]], [[George du Maurier]] and [[Ogden Nash]] do not form a school simply because they all wrote limericks.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Schools of criticism===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Poetry analysis is almost as old as poetry itself, with distinguished practitioners going back to figures such as [[Plato]]. At various times and places, groups of like-minded readers and scholars have developed, shared, and promoted specific approaches to poetry analysis.

'''[[New criticism|The New Criticism]]''' dominated [[England|English]] and [[United States|American]] [[literary criticism]] from the 1920s to the early 1960s. The New Critical approach insists on the value of [[close reading]] and rejects extra-textual sources. The New Critics also rejected the idea that the work of a critic or analyst is to determine an author's intended meaning (a view formalized by [[W.K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] as the [[intentional fallacy]]). The New Critics prized [[ambiguity]], and tended to favor works that lend themselves to multiple interpretations.

'''[[Reader Response]]''' developed in Germany and the United States as a reaction to New Criticism. It emphasises the reader's role in the development of meaning.

'''[[Reception aesthetics]]''' is a development of Reader Response that considers the public response to a literary work and suggests that this can inform analysis of cultural ideology at the time of the response.

===Reading poetry aloud===
All poetry was originally oral, it was sung or chanted; poetic form as we know it is an abstraction therefrom when writing replaced memory as a way of preserving poetic utterances, but the ghost of oral poetry never vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, John ''Rymes Reason - A Gude to English Verse'', Yale University Press,  New Haven 1981 {{ISBN|978-0-300-04307-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Poems may be read silently to oneself, or may be read aloud solo or to other people.  Although reading aloud to oneself raises eyebrows in many circles, few people find it surprising in the case of poetry.

In fact, many poems reveal themselves fully only when they are read aloud. The characteristics of such poems include (but are not limited to) a strong narrative, regular poetic meter, simple content and simple form.  At the same time, many poems that read well aloud have none of the characteristics exhibited by T. S. Eliot's "Journey of the Magi", for example. Poems that read aloud well include:

*"The Frog", by [[Jean Dao]]
*"One Art", by [[Elizabeth Bishop]]
*"[[The Tyger]]", by [[William Blake]]
*"Meeting at Night", by [[Robert Browning]]
*"[[She Walks in Beauty]]", by [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]]
*"The Song of the Western Men", by [[Robert Stephen Hawker]]
*"November in England", by [[Thomas Hood]]
*"Dream Variations", by [[Langston Hughes]]
*"[[The Ingoldsby Legends|The Jackdaw of Rheims]]", by [[Thomas Ingoldsby]]
*"To put one brick upon another", by [[Philip Larkin]]
*"Paul Revere's Ride", by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]
*"Adventures of Isabel", by [[Ogden Nash]]
*"Nothing but Death", by [[Pablo Neruda]] translated by [[Robert Bly]]
*"A Small Elegy", by [[Jirí Orten]] translated by [[Lynn Coffin]]
*"[[Ozymandias]]", by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]
*"[[The Cat in the Hat]]", by [[Dr. Seuss]]
*"Sea Surface Full of Clouds", by [[Wallace Stevens]]
*"Silver", by [[Walter de la Mare]]
*"How to Tell a Story", by [[Robert Penn Warren]]
*"On Westminster Bridge", by [[William Wordsworth]]

The course programming consists of 10–11 weeks of academic instruction at the postgraduate level and is hosted in [[Amelia, Umbria|Amelia, Italy]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;POVOLEDO, ELISABETTA. "A Master's in Art Crime (No Cloak and Dagger)"each summer.  ''The New York Times'', 21 July 2009.  Accessed on 23 June 2013 at: https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/arts/design/22crime.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The instruction covers a wide variety of theoretical and practical elements of art and heritage crime and examines art crime's interconnected world of art criminals, investigators, lawyers and art historians. The courses include comprehensive lectures and discussions exploring art crime, its nature and impact, as well as what is currently being done to mitigate it.

==Program==
The program includes approximately 25 lecture hours per week of customized instruction over the course of one summer for a total of approximately 250 contact hours with teaching professionals. This format allows students to complete the classroom portion of the program onsite, before writing their thesis remotely. [[Association for Research into Crimes against Art|ARCA]] selected this configuration to facilitate both student and allied professional enrollment, to ensure that both groups [http://www.artcrimeresearch.org/2016-postgraduate-certificate-program-in-art-crime-and-cultural-heritage-protection/ might undertake the program of study during one summer between academic advanced degrees or during a brief sabbatical or hiatus from work.]

It should be noted that this program is currently being run under the auspices of the association and is considered a professional development program and not a Masters.  While the courses comprising the Postgraduate Certificate Program may be used as evidence in support of a student's application for admission to a graduate degree program, the certificate itself is not considered to be a prerequisite nor does it not guarantee admission into a graduate study program.
Prerequisites for this program require that applicants have completed an undergraduate degree by the start date of the program. The program has run each summer since 2009.&lt;ref name="NY Times"/&gt;

The '''RSUA Bronze Medal''' is awarded annually by the [[Royal Society of Ulster Architects]] to the student of [[architecture]] in the final year of the [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] course at [[University of Ulster Belfast]] and the [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] course at [[Queen's University Belfast]] who, in the eyes of the assessors has produced the most successful major project.

In the sense that it is awarded to a student on completion of a project, the medal is analogous to the [[RIBA President's Medals Students Award]], but is not as prestigious.  Although the winner of the RSUA Bronze Medal is generally also nominated for the RIBA equivalent, no student has ever won both prizes.

[[File:RasBeyrouth.jpg|thumb|245px|The [[Solidere]] development of the [[Beirut]] seafront and harbor]]
[[File:Netherlands, The Hague, Boekelermeerstraat.JPG|thumb|245px|In the [[Netherlands]], virtually all housing is developed and built through property developers, including development in upmarket segments.]]

'''Real estate development''', or '''property development''', is a [[business process]], encompassing activities that range from the [[renovation]] and re-[[lease]] of existing [[building]]s to the purchase of raw [[Real Estate|land]] and the sale of [[developed land]] or parcels to others. Real estate developers are the people and companies who coordinate all of these activities, converting ideas from paper to real [[property]].&lt;ref name="Frej, Anne B 2003. p. 3"&gt;Frej, Anne B &amp; Peiser, Richard B. ''Professional Real Estate Development, Second Edition: The ULI Guide to the Business''. Urban Land Institute, 2003. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Real estate development is different from [[construction]], although many developers also manage the construction process.

Developers buy land, finance real estate deals, build or have builders build projects, create, imagine, control, and orchestrate the process of development from the beginning to end.&lt;ref name=NYT16Mar63&gt;New York Times, March 16, 1963, "Personality Boom is Loud for Louis Lesser"&lt;/ref&gt; Developers usually take the greatest [[risk]] in the creation or renovation of real estate—and receive the greatest rewards. Typically, developers purchase a tract of land, determine the [[marketing]] of the property, develop the building program and design, obtain the necessary public approval and financing, build the structures, and rent out, manage, and ultimately sell it.&lt;ref name="Frej, Anne B 2003. p. 3"/&gt;

Sometimes property developers will only undertake part of the process. For example, some developers source a property and get the plans and permits approved before selling the property with the plans and permits to a builder at a premium price. Alternatively, a developer that is also a builder may purchase a property with the plans and permits in place so that they do not have the risk of failing to obtain planning approval and can start construction on the development immediately.

Developers work with many different counterparts along each step of this process, including architects, city planners, engineers, surveyors, inspectors, contractors, lawyers, leasing agents, etc. In the [[Town and Country Planning]] context in the United Kingdom, 'development' is defined in the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]] s55.

==Credentials==
Many aspects of the real estate development process require local or state licensing, such as acting as a real estate broker or sales agent along. A real estate developer is not a professional designation, there are no schools or associations who recognize or protect the term as a trademark. Some real estate developers, often those involved in marketing properties through traditional real estate channels, choose to join business associations such as [[SIOR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://commercialobserver.com/2018/04/why-an-sior-designation-is-a-must-for-cre-professionals/|title=Why an SIOR Designation Is a Must for CRE Professionals|date=2018-04-16|work=Commercial Observer|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paths for entering the development field==
{{Main|Real estate development education}}
No single path automatically leads to success in real estate development.  Developers come from a variety of disciplines— construction, urban planning, lending, architecture, law and accounting, among others.  Recent specialized programs that award a [[Master of Real Estate Development]] (MRED) degree are also available. The graduate programs in real estate development are the most comprehensive education in the [[real estate industry]].  Other formal education includes a [[Master of Science in Real Estate]] (MSRE), or an [[MBA]].

==Organizing for development==
A development team can be put together in one of several ways.  At one extreme, a large company might include many services, from architecture to engineering.  At the other end of the spectrum, a development company might consist of one principal and a few staff who hire or contract with other companies and professionals for each service as needed.

Assembling a team of professionals to address the environmental, economic, private, physical and political issues inherent in a complex development project is critical. A developer's success depends on the ability to coordinate and lead the completion of a series of interrelated activities efficiently and at the appropriate time.

Development process requires skills of many professionals: [[architect]]s, [[landscape architect]]s, [[civil engineer]]s and [[site planner]]s to address project design; [[market consultant]]s to determine demand and a project's economics; [[Lawyer|attorneys]] to handle agreements and [[government approval]]s; [[Environmental consulting|environmental consultant]]s and [[Geotechnical engineering|soils engineer]]s to analyze a site's physical limitations and [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental impacts]]; [[surveyor]]s and [[Title insurance|title]] companies to provide [[legal description]]s of a property; and [[lender]]s to provide financing. The [[general contractor]] of the project hires [[subcontractor]]s to put the [[architectural plan]]s into action.

==Land development==
{{Further|Land development}}
Purchasing unused land for a potential development is sometimes called '''[[speculation|speculative]] development'''.

[[Subdivision (land)|Subdivision]] of land is the principal mechanism by which communities are developed.  Technically, subdivision describes the legal and physical steps a developer must take to convert raw land into developed land.  Subdivision is a vital part of a community's growth, determining its appearance, the mix of its land uses, and its infrastructure, including [[road]]s, [[drainage]] systems, [[water supply|water]], [[sewerage]], and [[public utilities]].

Land development can pose the most risk, but can also be the most [[profitable]] technique as it is dependent on the [[public sector]] for approvals and infrastructure and because it involves a long investment period with no positive [[cash flow]].

After subdivision is complete, the developer usually markets the land to a home builder or other end user, for such uses as a [[warehouse]] or [[shopping center]]. In any case, use of [[Spatial intelligence (business method)|spatial intelligence]] tools mitigate the risk of these developers by modeling the population trends and demographic make-up of the sort of customers a home builder or retailer would like to have surrounding their new development.

'''Robert McKee''' (born 1941) is an [[author]], [[lecturer]] and [[story consultant]] who is widely known for his popular "Story [[Seminar]]", which he developed when he was a professor at the [[University of Southern California]]. McKee is the author of ''Story: Substance, Structure, Style and the Principles of Screenwriting'', ''Dialogue: the Art of Verbal Action for Stage, Page and Screen'' and ''Storynomics: Story-Driven Marketing in the Post-Advertising World''. McKee also has the blog and online writers' resource "[https://www.storylogue.com/ Storylogue]".

Robert McKee’s “Story Seminars” have been held around the globe including [[Boston]], [[Moscow]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Beijing]], [[Mumbai]], [[Paris]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and yearly in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[London]]. The 3-day seminar teaches writers the principles of [[storytelling]]. McKee's one-day "[[Genre]] Seminars" teach writers the conventions of different styles of storytelling including [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]], [[Comedy film|comedy]], [[horror film|horror]], [[Romance film|love story]], [[Action (fiction)|action story]], and writing for [[Television program|television]].

Rather than teaching story as a "mechanical" form, McKee gained notoriety for teaching story principles, allowing writers for [[Theatre|theater]], [[Novel|novels]], [[film]] and [[television]] freedom to apply them as they wish provided the story ultimately “works”.

After consulting on business storytelling for various multinational companies including [[Microsoft]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Time Warner]], and [[Siemens]], in the fall of 2013 McKee launched a seminar for the business community in [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], [[Beijing]], and [[Malta]]. In 2018, McKee partnered with digital marketer and Skyword CEO [[Tom Gerace]] to write ''Storynomics: Story-Driven Marketing in the Post-Advertising World.'' Storynomics, and the accompanying seminar, instructs leaders, managers and marketers how to use story in [[strategic management]], [[brand management]], and [[Business communication|business communications]].

== Early life in the theater ==
Robert McKee began his theater career at the age of 9, playing the title role in a community theater production of 'Martin the Shoemaker'. He continued acting as a teenager in theater productions in his hometown of [[Detroit, Michigan]]. Upon receiving the Evans scholarship, he attended the [[University of Michigan]] and earned a Bachelor's degree in [[English Literature]]. While an undergraduate, he acted in and directed over thirty productions. McKee's creative writing professor was the noted [[Kenneth Thorpe Rowe]].

After completing his Bachelor of Arts degree, McKee toured with the APA (Association of Producing Artists) Repertory Company, appearing on Broadway alongside [[Helen Hayes]], [[Rosemary Harris]] and [[Will Geer]]. He then received the Professional Theater Fellowship and returned to [[Ann Arbor|Ann Arbor, Michigan]] to earn his Master's degree in [[Theater|Theater Arts]].

Upon graduating, McKee directed the Toledo Repertory Company, acted with the American Drama Festival, and became Artistic Director of the Aaron Deroy Theater. From there he traveled to London to accept the position of [[Artist-in-residence]] at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] where he studied Shakespearean production at the [[Old Vic]] theatre. He then returned to New York City and spent the next seven years as an actor/director in [[Broadway theater|Broadway]].

== Mid-life in the film industry ==
After deciding to move his career to film, McKee attended Cinema School at the University of Michigan. While there, he directed two short films: ''A Day Off'', which he also wrote, and ''Talk To Me Like The Rain'', adapted from a one-act play by [[Tennessee Williams]]. These two films won the Cine Eagle Award, awards at the Brussels and Grenoble Film Festivals, and various prizes at the Delta, Rochester, Chicago and Baltimore Film Festivals.

In 1979, McKee moved to Los Angeles, where he began to write screenplays and work as a story analyst for [[United Artists]] and [[NBC]]. He sold his first screenplay ''Dead Files'' to AVCO/Embassy Films, after which he joined the WGA ([http://www.wga.org/ Writers Guild of America]). His next screenplay, ''Hard Knocks'', won the National Screenwriting Contest, and since then McKee has had eight feature film screenplays purchased or optioned, including the feature film script ''Trophy'' for [[Warner Bros.]] (Only one of these films, however, was produced). In addition to his screenplays, McKee has had a number of scripts produced for television series such as ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'' (starring [[Jack Klugman]]), ''[[Columbo#Mrs. Columbo spin-off|Mrs. Columbo]]'' (starring [[Kate Mulgrew]]), ''[[Spenser: for Hire]]'' and ''[[Kojak]]'' (starring [[Telly Savalas]]).

== Starting the STORY seminar ==
In 1983, as [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholar]], McKee joined the faculty of the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|School of Cinema-Television]] at the [[University of Southern California|University of Southern California (USC)]], where he began offering his famous STORY Seminar class. A year later, McKee opened the course to the public, giving a 3-day, 30-hour intensive class to sold-out audiences around the world.

Since 1984, more than 50,000 students have taken McKee's course, at various cities around the world: Los Angeles, New York, London, Paris, Sydney, Toronto, Boston, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Helsinki, Oslo, Munich, Tel Aviv, Auckland, Singapore, Barcelona, Stockholm, São Paulo and more. In March 2011 and again in 2012, he taught a four-day seminar in Bogotá, Colombia. In February 2012 he taught another four-day seminar in the Ramoji film city of Hyderabad in India. He did the same in [[Amsterdam]], March 2014.

McKee's current lecture series includes the 3-day "Story Seminar", 1-day "Genre Seminars" (teaching the conventions of [[Romance film|love Story]], [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]], [[comedy]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Action fiction|action]] and writing for [[television]]) and the 1-day “Storynomics Seminar”, teaching the application of storytelling principles in the business and marketing world (co-lectured with CEO of Skyword [[Tom Gerace]]).

McKee continues to be a project consultant to major film and television production companies, corporations and governments around the world, as well major software firms such as [[Microsoft]]. In addition, several companies such as [[ABC Studios|ABC]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Miramax]], [[PBS]], [[Nickelodeon]] and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] regularly send their creative and writing staffs to his lectures. 

== Life and awards ==
Robert McKee is among the most widely known screenwriting [[lecturers]]. McKee's former students include over 65 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winners, 200 [[Emmy Award]] winners, 100 WGA ([[Writers Guild of America]]) Award winners and 50 DGA ([[Directors Guild of America]]) Award winners (all participated in McKee's course before or after winning their award; not all were awarded for writing), the British Book of the Year Award and the [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing]]. Some recent notable former students to win or be nominated for Oscars include [[Akiva Goldsman]] for his screenplay "[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]," [[Peter Jackson]] (writer/director of "[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]] I, II and III”), [[Andrew Stanton]] (“[[WALL-E|Wall*E]],” “[[Finding Nemo]]”) and [[Paul Haggis]] (“[[Million Dollar Baby]],” “[[Quantum of Solace]]”). 

He was profiled by Bob Simon of ''60 Minutes'' for [[CBS News]], and by [[CNN]] who also reviewed the Story Seminar. Notable writers and actors such as [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Paul Haggis]], [[Akiva Goldsman]], [[William Goldman]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[David Bowie]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[John Cleese]], Tony Kaye, [[Steven Pressfield]], among many others have taken his seminar.&lt;ref name="MT" /&gt;

In 1990, Robert McKee was brought to [[New Zealand]] by the NZ Film Commission, and delivered a three-day seminar on screenplay and story structure in [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]]. In the audience were [[Jane Campion]] and [[Peter Jackson]], the latter of which went on to write and direct ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]''.

In 2000, McKee won the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061207213752/http://www.editor.net/k-k/old/prize99.htm 1999 International Moving Image Book Award] for his book ''Story'' ([[ReganBooks|Regan Books]]/[[HarperCollins]]). The book, currently in its 19th printing in the United States and its 14th printing in the [[UK|United Kingdom]], has become required reading for film and cinema schools at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale]], [[UCLA]], [[University of Southern California|USC]] and [[Tulane University|Tulane]] universities.[[Robert McKee#cite note-autogenerated1-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]][[Robert McKee#cite note-3|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] The book was on the [[Los Angeles Times]] best-seller list for 20 weeks. It is translated into over 20 languages.

In 2017 McKee was inducted into the [https://www.finaldraft.com/company/hall-fame-awards/ Hall of Fame at the Final Draft Awards], an honor that recognizes professionals who have had a "profound influence on the industry"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.finaldraft.com/company/hall-fame-awards/|title=Hall of Fame Awards {{!}} Final Draft®|work=Final Draft®|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining peers such as [[Lawrence Kasdan]] and [[Steven Zaillian]].

McKee's other credits include writing and presenting the [[BBC]] series ''Filmworks'', the [[Channel Four]] series ''Reel Secrets'', the [[BAFTA]] Award-winning ''J'accuse Citizen Kane'' television program which he wrote and presented, and the writing of [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109036 ''Abraham''], the four-hour mini-series on [[Turner Network Television]] (TNT) that starred [[Richard Harris]], [[Barbara Hershey]] and [[Maximilian Schell]].

==Criticism==
McKee has been criticized by writer [[Joe Eszterhas]], for teaching screenwriting without ever having a script of his made into a film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies2.nytimes.com/2006/09/17/books/review/Queenan.t.html 'Basic Instinct'] — New York Times article by Joe Queenan, September 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/filmprogramme/filmprogramme_20070209.shtml |title=— Film programme interview, 9 February 2007' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, McKee is credited as writer of the 1994 TV movie ''Abraham''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|571210}}&lt;/ref&gt;) McKee has responded to such criticisms, saying, "The world is full of people who teach things they themselves cannot do", while admitting that even though he sold all of his written screenplays, he still lacks their screen credit since they were only optioned and not ever produced by the studios.&lt;ref name="MT"&gt;[http://www.umich.edu/~newsinfo/MT/95/Jun95/mt21j95.html Michigan Today – June 1995] — interview with Brett Forrest&lt;/ref&gt;

While McKee's work might appear to be a fresh approach to story structure, many of the ideas he discusses have been around since [[Aristotle]] and notably appear in the work of [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]],&lt;ref name="Archer1912"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Archer|title=Play-making: A Manual of Craftsmanship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Xs_AAAAYAAJ|accessdate=March 31, 2013|year=1912|publisher=Small, Maynard}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Howard Lawson]] and [[Alexander Mackendrick]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Nevertheless, McKee himself tells his students that Aristotle is the basis for much of what he teaches and he often distributes some of John Howard Lawson's writings at his seminar: he acknowledges his forebears and never claims that he is inventing a brand new approach to story telling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleid=305 | title = Robert McKee – Lessons of a screenwriting guru | author = Ian Parker | date = January 27, 2004 | accessdate = March 31, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130206102146/http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleid=305 | archivedate = February 6, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore he claims that much of what he teaches was common knowledge 50 or 60 years ago, but that screenwriters have lost touch with the fundamentals of storytelling. In a CBC interview he said that to give his lecture in the 1930s, 40s or 50s "would have been ludicrous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc5QRxZidNQ | title = Robert McKee on The Hour with George Stroumboulopoulos | accessdate = March 31, 2013 | date = July 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKee also appears and is criticized in several works, for example, ''Missionnaire'' by French author [[Joann Sfar]].

==In popular culture==
In the [[Charlie Kaufman]]-penned film ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation.]]'', McKee's character was portrayed by the [[Emmy Award]]-winning actor [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]. In the Oscar-winning movie, the desperate screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (played by [[Nicolas Cage]]) reluctantly goes to McKee's course, but then – after being "shaken" by McKee's tough-style response to his claim that "nothing happens in the real world" – Kaufman asks McKee to meet in person to discuss his failure to write the [[film adaptation]] he is working on.

Though the story depicts McKee as little more than an amalgam of hack clichés on the subject of screen writing, Charlie's slacker brother Donald uses the knowledge obtained attending the famous seminar to write a [[spec script]] he then sells for a large amount of money through his brother's agent. The film then concludes with the very ending that McKee is ridiculed for recommending, as well as a voice-over epilogue in which — by means of voice-over narration — Cage's Kaufman character admonishes himself for disobeying a cardinal rule of McKee's to avoid voice-over narration.

McKee appeared on the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Caper Chase]]" as himself.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/yale-harvard-war-bogs-down-overstuffed-simpsons-253107&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anecdotes ==
* McKee claims in his seminars that he does ''not'' say not to use voice-over narration. There is some truth to the scene in ''Adaptation'' however, as he vehemently teaches that using voice-over to substitute for telling the story via action and dialogue is weak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.storylogue.com/docs/question-answer.html?documentId=1345 | title = Q&amp;A: What did you think of the voice-over in GOODFELLAS? | author = Robert McKee | date = August 10, 2013 | accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas he teaches that voice-over used to counterpoint and enrich the story can be wonderful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://peachseedmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mckeevoiceovertechnique.pdf | title = A Study in Voice Over Narration from two recent films, SAVAGES and BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD. | author = Robert McKee | date = August 13, 2012 | accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* McKee is known to object to the French-originated "[[auteur theory]]", which states that the director is the de facto author of a movie.  McKee states otherwise, that the writer/screenwriter is in fact the most important creator of the movie.
* In a ''[[Haaretz]]'' article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/782893.html | title = וודי אלן לא עשה עלייה (in Hebrew, rough translation "Woody Allen did increase") | date = November 2, 2006 | accessdate = March 31, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605041310/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/782893.html | archivedate = June 5, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; McKee was quoted as saying in front of a Tel Aviv audience that Israelis have a rough sense of humor, completely different from the known worldwide Jewish one, since Israelis are living in a harsh reality which leads them to lose their sense of humor.

In '''safe-life design''' products are designed to survive a specific [[design life]] with a chosen reserve.

Safe life is particularly relevant to metal aircraft, where [[airframe]] components are subjected to varying loads over the lifetime of the aircraft which makes them susceptible to [[Fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]]. In certain areas such as in wing or tail components structural failure in flight would be catastrophic.

The safe-life design technique is employed in critical systems which are either very difficult to repair or may cause severe damage to life and property. These systems are designed to work for years without requirement of any repairs.

The drawback is that products designed with a safe-life approach are over-built or allocated more resources than they are expected to need, which may be uneconomical.
In order to maintain the designed safety, they will have to be replaced after the [[design life]] has expired, while they may still have a considerable life ahead of them. To counter these drawbacks, alternative [[design philosophy|design philosophies]] like [[Fail-safe|fail-safe design]] and [[fault-tolerant design]] were developed.

"'''Snow Drifts'''" is the twenty-first episode of the [[Once Upon a Time (season 3)|third season]] of the American fantasy drama series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', and the show's 65th episode overall, which aired on May 11, 2014. The episode serves as the first of a two part episode for the third season finale and was written by [[David H. Goodman]] &amp; [[Robert Hull]] and directed by [[Ron Underwood]].
In this episode, everyone in Storybrooke joins Mary Margaret and David as they prepare to give their newborn son a coronation, while the time traveling portal that Zelena created before her demise comes to life, and takes [[Emma Swan]] and [[Captain Hook]] back to the Enchanted Forest before the events of the original curse. Emma and Hook must find a way to return to Storybrooke. But in their quest to return, they accidentally ruin Snow and Charming's first meeting, and they must repair the timeline with Rumplestiltskin's help before it is too late to undo the damage.

==Plot==

===Opening Sequence===
Zelena's time travel portal opens in the Enchanted Forest.

===Event chronology===
The Boston flashbacks happen years after "[[Awake (Once Upon a Time)| Awake]]" and before "[[Breaking Glass (Once Upon a Time)|Breaking Glass]]" while the Enchanted Forest past events happen after "[[A Tale of Two Sisters (Once Upon a Time)|A Tale of Two Sisters]]" and changing the events of "[[Snow Falls]]" and before "[[There's No Place Like Home (Once Upon a Time)|There's No Place Like Home]]".  

===In the Characters' Past===
In the past (our world) a young girl leaves with a couple in a car from an adoption agency, where an eleven-year-old [[Emma Swan]]&lt;ref&gt;According to "[[Selfless, Brave and True]]", Emma came to Storybrooke in October 2011 (the moment August started turning into wood, as stated in "[[The Stranger (Once Upon a Time)|The Stranger]]"). This was her 28th birthday, according to "[[Pilot (Once Upon a Time)|Pilot]]". Season Two and the first half of Season Three takes place a few months later, and the second half of Season Three takes place one year later, in 2013. In "[[The Tower (Once Upon a Time)|The Tower]]", David says that it's been nearly thirty years since Emma was born. This means that Emma has not turned 30 yet. The flashback takes place 18 years earlier.&lt;/ref&gt; is standing, looking upset that she'll never have a perfect family, but the foster manager comes up to her and tells Emma, "Don't worry, you'll find a home too, Emma."

===In Storybrooke===
In the present day, Emma looks happy and sees Mary Margaret holding her baby boy as she prepares for the upcoming coronation even though they haven't named him yet. Henry is looking for apartments and both Henry and Mary Margaret ask Emma what she thinks. Emma changes the subject and starts thinking why her parents are trying to expand the time they need to name the unnamed baby by using an age-old tradition. Meanwhile, Regina and Robin Hood are sharing some romantic time together. She tells him about how TinkerBell told her about them being soulmates, how she saw the lion tattoo but didn't approach him in the pub. However, Robin is happy to hear that, saying it must be the right time for them now. Later on at Granny's, everyone is recalling or retelling stories of how Mary Margaret and David originally met back in the Enchanted Forest and how they kept running into one another and were destined to be together. When Emma reveals her desire to return to New York City with Henry in an attempt to leave Storybrooke behind, Regina and the others exclaim in protest. Suddenly Gold notices an orange beam rising in the distance, which he tells them is the time portal. As this starts to happen, Emma tells everyone that she wants to go back to New York City and everyone including Regina doesn't like the idea. Emma then walks out and Hook follows her, taking the fairytale book with him. Meanwhile, Regina, David, Belle, Gold, Robin, and Mary Margaret visit the jail to see if Zelena had died around the same time as the portal's opening. They see on the jail's surveillance video that she committed suicide, but are unaware that Gold altered the video to make it look like she killed herself.

As they stop by the park, Emma tells Hook that she is confused about going back to New York City. Hook then hands Emma the book, telling her Henry hoped it would remind her where they're from. The conversation is cut short when they notice the time-travel orange beam forming and Emma runs towards the barn, where the doors burst open. The beam pulls Emma towards the vortex, and Hook tries to hold her back by digging his hook into the ground with Emma holding onto his leg. Emma can't hold on and is immediately sucked into the portal. Hook says "One of these days I'm going to have to stop chasing this woman,"  and jumps in after her. The portal closes as her cellphone, which is left behind in the barnyard, is ringing with a call from David, who was trying to warn her.

===In the Enchanted Forest's New Past===
Seconds later, both Emma and Hook land in the Enchanted Forest. It turns out that, while going through the portal, Emma was thinking of her parents' first meeting, which is how and where they ended up. The two then come across the wanted signs for Snow White from the past and then stumble onto a village, where they see Regina terrorizing the villagers demanding that they tell her where her stepdaughter is.  Regina proves that she is not kidding by having a woman arrested for helping Snow. Emma wants to help the woman, but Hook warns her about changing the future so they can't save the woman, since the villagers that were threatened by The Evil Queen included Pinocchio, Gepetto, and Granny. Around the same time, both Prince James (Charming) and Abigail are in the carriage in the moments before Snow and James are due to meet. Snow cuts a tree down to make her highway robbery, causing the carriage to stop as she is in a tree waiting. As Charming gets out the carriage to investigate, Emma makes the biggest mistake in altering the timeline by making an accidental noise and surprises Snow, who falls and runs aways, empty handed without taking the jewels from the carriage, and preventing her parents from meeting for the first time. Emma discovers that she screwed up the past and realizes that the only way to stop this altered timeline is by seeking out the only person capable of correcting this mistake, namely Rumplestiltskin. As the approach Rumplestiltskin's castle, Rumplestiltskin himself appears out of nowhere ready to kill Hook (as he still holds a grudge after Hook stole his wife, Milah, and [[The Crocodile (Once Upon a Time)|took the magic bean]] Rumplestiltskin was going to use to find his son, Baelfire) but Emma then reveals to him that he will create the curse that he hopes will one day find his son Baelfire, and killing Hook will further destroy the timeline. As the pages in the book start to become blank, time is starting to run out for Emma to fix what she has done, and Rumplestiltskin tells her the only way to correct this is to go to the ball that will be held at King Midas' palace.

Seeing that Snow wants passage after failing to secure one from Blackbeard, they hatch a plan to have her steal the ring for passage out of the forest by using Hook’s ship, which means they have to pay a visit to the tavern to distract a past version of Killian Jones, so Hook sends Emma to distract the Past Hook while he's drinking with his mates. The Future Hook suddenly becomes jealous of Past Hook for flirting with Emma, as she keeps Past Hook occupied while Future Hook offers Snow a deal, but things get out of hand when Smee first becomes confused by the difference in his captain, and second when Past Hook shows up while Future Hook is still there. Emma orders him to leave, and Hook looks on jealously as the Past Hook comes on and kisses her. The Future Hook then taps his previous life on the shoulder and punches him. Hook replies that he was asking for it, saying that he'll blame the rum for his actions.

Later that night at Midas' palace, Emma and Hook watch to see what happens when Rumplestiltskin appears. He gives them an invitation and alters their looks so they can blend in. As they enter the palace, Emma gives them the [[Pseudonym|aliases]] "[[Princess Leia]]" and "[[Prince Charles]]" in front of King Midas, and as they take a waltz together they see James and Abigail together but she doesn't want to dance with James. The Evil Queen arrives at the palace to ask Midas to search the place just in time for Snow to show up and take the ring. As expected, James captures Snow, altering the timeline of the first time they met (and she hits him, this time with a jewelry box instead of a rock). As she makes her escape, Emma sees her running and James yelling at her to stop and saying that he'll find her (another altered timeline in their encounter), only to have Emma (who finds the ring left behind by Snow and hides it from plain view) get caught by Regina and arrested. The story continues in the following episode.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
The episode, along with "There's No Place Like Home," pulled in respectable numbers, placing a 2.3/7 with 6.8 million viewers tuning in (as they were combined as a two-hour episode), winning in both the 8 pm and 9 pm timeslots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/05/12/tv-ratings-sunday-revenge-once-upon-a-time-finales-rise-the-simpsons-down-rosemarys-baby-low/262779/ "TV Ratings Sunday: 'Revenge' &amp; 'Once Upon A Time' Finales Rise, 'The Simpsons' Down, 'Rosemary's Baby' Low"] from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (May 12, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:StudioEIS NCC 9981.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Some of the 42 signers of the U.S. Constitution at the National Constitution Center, Philadelphia. Photo (c) Elliot Schwartz for StudioEIS]]'''StudioEIS''' (pronounced "Studio Ice") is a [[sculpture]] and [[design studio]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States. It specializes in "visual storytelling" — the production of figurative sculpture in [[bronze]], stone, and resin for narrative exhibitions at cultural institutions, museums, and corporations worldwide.

== History ==

StudioEIS was founded in 1977 by [[New York City]] natives Ivan Schwartz (BFA [[Boston University]] College of Fine Arts) and Elliot Schwartz (BFA [[California Institute of the Arts]], MFA [[Yale University]]). It pioneered the design and production of innovative figurative sculptures for use as visual storytelling elements within museum settings during the 1970s. When the company was founded, [[museum]] displays were "peopled" by store mannequins. With growing resistance to using mass-produced mannequins for exhibitions, and with many museums eliminating staff positions, StudioEIS found a niche for itself in the world of narrative storytelling for museums. With the [[American Bicentennial]] at hand and a renewed interest in history, numerous museums were established across the country to address topics as diverse as [[civil rights]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] history, and science and technology. This confluence of talent and need created the initial impetus for StudioEIS' work.

Museums large and small began out-sourcing displays via [[exhibition designers]], and called upon StudioEIS to create lifelike sculptures to tell stories about American culture and its political history in vivid ways that put a face to history. StudioEIS' early commissions, for the [[National Civil Rights Museum]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]], were figurative, life-sized, and designed to engage the museum visitor.

With a growing reputation, StudioEIS began to work outside the museum world where innovative object making through visual storytelling was born at StudioEIS. The studio now began to work with [[architects]], industrial and scenic designers, restaurant designers, and hotel/[[casino designers]]. Sony, the [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio Hotel and Casino]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], Nike's flagship stores in Portland and Chicago, [[The Discovery Channel]], and [[Martha Stewart Living]] are among its many corporate clients. StudioEIS' sculptures have been on display outside the United States in Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, Italy, Hong Kong, and Abu Dhabi.

The prominence of the studio grew as it became especially well known for its bronze portrait sculptures and public works, which have included sculptures of iconic figures, such as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Albert Einstein]], Frederick Douglass and 42 bronze [[Founding Fathers]] at the [[National Constitution Center]] - which may be the largest bronze sculpture project of its type in American history. The distinguished portrait sculptures created by StudioEIS are featured in important cultural institutions such as The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History, The National WWII Museum in New Orleans, The Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia and The American Museum of Natural History in New York City.  StudioEIS' expertise has been called upon for high-profile "forensic" reconstruction projects for George Washington's [[Mount Vernon]] Estate and Gardens, the exhibition "Written in Bone" at the [[National Museum of Natural History]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the exhibition JANE, Starvation, Cannibalism &amp; Endurance at Jamestown for Jamestown and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History.

Today StudioEIS' staff of [[sculptors]], [[painters]], costumers, researchers, and model-makers is enhanced by specialists in wax works, metal fabrication, and [[bronze casting]]. A project will often include collaboration with scholars in [[anthropology]], costume history, and [[forensic science]]. The sculptures of [[George Washington]] at ages 19, 45 and 57 that were unveiled at [[Mount Vernon]] in 2006 involved state-of-the-art forensic research and computer reconstruction.

StudioEIS’ Archive resides at the Briscoe Center of American History at the University of Texas/Austin. It was unveiled in November 2014.

Each story in the collection is centered on a person who is making his living by some novel and extraordinary means (a "queer trade", using the word "queer" in the sense of "peculiar"). To gain admittance one must have invented a unique means of earning a living and the subsequent trade being the main source of income.

'''''The Joy of Painting''''' is an American half-hour instructional television show hosted by painter [[Bob Ross]] which ran from January 11, 1983 until May 17, 1994. In each episode, Ross taught techniques for landscape oil painting, completing a painting in each session. The program followed the same format as its predecessor, ''[[The Magic of Oil Painting]]'', hosted by Ross's mentor [[Bill Alexander (painter)|Bill Alexander]]. During its run, it won three Emmy Awards.

==Production==
Broadcast by non-commercial public television stations, the show's first season was in 1983, and initially produced by [[MHz Networks|WNVC]] in [[Falls Church, Virginia]], then by [[WIPB]] in [[Muncie, Indiana]], from 1984 until the show ended in 1994, and later by [[Blue Ridge PBS|Blue Ridge Public Television]] in [[Roanoke, Virginia]]. Most of the series was distributed by what is now [[American Public Television]]. Reruns continued to air in syndication in the United States under the title ''The Best of The Joy of Painting'', featuring a collection of Bob Ross's favorite paintings from past seasons.

==Format==
Each 30-minute show usually begins with Ross (or a guest) standing in front of a blank canvas against a white or black background. Guests included Ross's long-time friend Dana Jester,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zDp921OxLI|title=Dana Jester Painting Bob Ross Style}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Sunlight in Shadows |episodelink= |url= |series=The Joy of Painting |serieslink= |credits=Sally Schenck (director) |network=PBS |station= |city= |airdate= |began= |ended= |season=27 |seriesno= |number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Ross's son Steve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_l6olF3yHI|title=Bob Ross - Mountain Range (Season 8 Episode 11)}}&lt;/ref&gt; his old instructor John Thamm, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twoinchbrush.com/guest-painters|title=List of guest painters on 'The Joy of Painting' |website=TwoInchBrush.com |access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the 30-minute program, Ross graphically ran the colors across the screen (this was not done in earlier seasons), as he turned the blank canvas into an imaginary [[Landscape painting|landscape]], using the [[wet-on-wet]] oil painting technique, in which the painter continues adding paint on top of still-wet paint rather than waiting for each layer of paint to dry. Combining this method with the use of two-inch and other types of [[paintbrush|brushes]], as well as [[painting knife|painting knives]], allowed him to paint trees, water, clouds, and mountains in a matter of seconds.

Each painting would start with simple strokes that appeared to be nothing more than the smudges of color. As he added more and more strokes, the blotches transformed into intricate landscapes.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/listening_post/2008/09/annuals-bob-ros |title=Annuals + Bob Ross = Such Fun |first=Scott |last=Thill |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=September 5, 2008 |accessdate=January 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As he painted, he instructed viewers regarding the techniques he was using, he added comments describing the "happy little clouds" and "happy little trees" that he was creating. He would also have home video footage of Ross with a baby [[squirrel]], [[deer]], raccoon, as well as another small animal. Each program was shot in [[real time (media)|real time]] with two cameras: a [[medium shot]] of Ross and his canvas, and a [[close-up]] shot of the canvas or [[Palette (painting)|palette]]. At the end of each episode, Ross was known for saying something akin to, "So from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend", and then, the credits roll over a shot of the day's painting, with the show's theme song being heard.

Ross created three versions of each painting for each episode of the show. The first, painted prior to taping, sat on an easel, off-camera, and was used by Ross as a template to create the second copy—the one viewers actually watched him paint.  After taping the episode, Ross painted a third, more detailed version for inclusion in his instructional books.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2016/08/29/490923502/the-real-bob-ross-meet-the-meticulous-artist-behind-those-happy-trees The Real Bob Ross: Meet The Meticulous Artist Behind Those Happy Trees].

==Episodes==

===Season 1 (1983)===
The first season of ''The Joy of Painting'' aired on many PBS stations across the east coast, but the audience was small. And the quality of the audio and video was so poor, that the first season may never air again. Bob would have to look for a new home on public television. This time, at [[WIPB]] in Muncie, Indiana.

'''''The Orange Sky''''' ({{lang-uk|Помаранчеве Небо}}). This film was made in 2006, after the [[Orange Revolution]] which took place in [[Ukraine]].  It was directed by Oleksandr Kyryenko with the Cinema Production.

==Mini-Synopsis==
The movie tells of a love story of two greatly different young people. The heroine, Ivanna is a young girl with ambitiously nationalistic beliefs in the power of democracy.  She expresses her patriotism by voicing, often protesting the present regime of Ukraine in the favor of revolutionary ideals.  Mark, the protagonist, on the other hand is a privileged son of a government official whose life is filled with excitement from being able to get everything his heart desires. The two meet in the midst of a national crisis when a series of massive protests and political events were unfolding in Ukraine. Of course with the meeting, the two fall in love forever changing each other's paths. Mark is unwillingly becoming estranged from his comfortable life and seeks to obtain understanding of what drives Ivana and her friends to stand up to authority. Eventually two are united in one cause: fighting for a better future for their country. The movie uses a semi-reenactment of the actual events of the winter in Ukraine during the Orange Revolution. The protests, the rioting, the cold weather are all there.

==Criticism==
The “Orange Sky” movie seems to represent exactly that transition  of original cinematography into a less sophisticated form of movie productions such as presently known as “pop culture” and “show business”. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

'''''Timthal Baghdad (Baghdad's Statue)''''' is a public monument in Baghdad, created by the sculptor, [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]] (1929-2011) and inaugurated in 2013. It is a tall column with a woman dressed in [[Abassid]] costume sitting on the top. The column is inscribed with Arabic letters, taken from a famous Arabic poem by eminent poet, Mustafa Jamal al-Din. The statue is intended to glorify both the city and its ancient heritage.

==Background==

In 2010, the Mayor of Baghdad commissioned the sculptor, Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, to complete a series of four monuments as part of a Baghdad Culture program. The artist began work on four new sculptures to be erected in various locations around Baghdad. However, this would be his final project, for the sculptor died before it was completed. Ghani's son oversaw the completion of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, T., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat," [Biographical Notes], Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ghani-Hikmat.aspx Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; All four works blended Iraqi tradition with modern techniques and materials. 

The first to be completed was ''Al Fanous El Sehri'' (Magic Lantern) inaugurated in 2011. The remaining three works, ''Ashaar Baghdad'' (Baghdad's Poetry), a fountain featuring Arabic script; ''Timthal Baghdad,'' (Baghdad's Statue) a column featuring the city as a beautiful girl, wearing traditional [[Abassid]] costume.&lt;ref name=Arraf&gt;Arraf, J., "Renowned Iraqi sculptor has vision for Baghdad to 'flower again'," ''CS Monitor,'' 16 February, 2011; [https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0216/Renowned-Iraqi-sculptor-has-vision-for-Baghdad-to-flower-again Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''Enkath El Iraq'' (Saving Iraq's Culture), a Sumerian cylindrical seal in the hands of an Iraqi citizen;&lt;ref name=Arraf/&gt; were all inaugurated in 2013.&lt;ref name=Dawood&gt;Dawood, M., "Mohamed Ghani Hikmat brings life back to the squares of Baghdad Months after the Departure of the "Sheikh of the Sculptors," ''Alrai Media'', January, 2012, [http://www.alraimedia.com/Home/Details?Id=0c161045-cd85-4208-a9e6-31d4e3ee4c27 Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mohammed Ghani Hikmat was known for his public works, now on display throughout Baghdad's urban spaces, and also for smaller statues carved in wood, depicting the everyday life of Baghdad's people.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, T., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat," [Biographical Notes], Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ghani-Hikmat.aspx Online:] &lt;/ref&gt; His most well-known works include a pair of statues of ''[[Scheherazade|Queen Scheherazade]] and [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryār|King Shahryar]]'', located on the banks of the Tigris River, near Abu Nuwas Street&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, M.S., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, Iraqi Sculptor, Dies at 82", ''New York Times'', 21 September, 2011 [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/arts/design/mohammed-ghani-hikmat-iraqi-sculptor-dies-at-82.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Fountain of Kahramana'' in Baghdad's central business district.&lt;ref&gt;Antoon, S., "Living With Death in Baghdad", ''New York Times'', 20  July, 2016 [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/opinion/living-with-death-in-baghdad.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of location for his works, was important to Ghani, who wanted the sculptures to be accessible to all. He avoided public squares and gardens, but instead wanted his works to be situated in the streets and on the side of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Jairath. S., "Baghdad will Remain Baghdad" Mohammed Ghani and his Tales of One Thousand and One Nights", ''Meanjin'' Vol 74, Issue 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
Timthal Baghdad (or Baghdad's Statue) (pictured) is a 13.5 metre column which features Arabic calligraphy along its length.

==Description==

The first of the three sculptures inaugurated in 2013 was Timthal Baghdad (Baghdad’s Statue, pictured).&lt;ref name=official&gt;"Official Inauguration of Three Sculptures in Iraq Baghdad," ''Alsamuria News,'' 13 February, 2013 [https://www.alsumaria.tv/news/71811/official-inauguration-of-three-sculptures-in-iraq/en# Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a column featuring a lady sitting on a chair wearing Abbassid traditional clothes and is located in Andalusia square (Al Andalus). The overall height of the column is 13.5 metres (10.5 metre base and 3 metres for the figure), making it one of the tallest monuments in the city centre..&lt;ref name=official/&gt;                       

The column features poetry by the great poet, Mustafa Jamal al-Din, which glorify the city of Baghdad.&lt;ref name=Dawood/&gt;  The verse reads in part:
{{Blockquote|Baghdad, what did you do?

Only let your green window shine

You passed the world and your morning is sunny

And I will judge you, and your night will be moonlit}}

The figure of the Abassid woman is reclining, with her back to the sun, so that she is looking towards the horizon in front of her. The woman is intended to signify that the country's ancestors were from the East. This reference is another reference objectively tied to the base of the monument.&lt;ref&gt;"Statue of Baghdad by sculptor Mohamed Ghani Hikmat" ''Ministry of Culture'' [Government of Iraq], 2013, [http://mocul.gov.iq/index.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;op=PrintPage&amp;sid=1071 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Zweites Buch''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈtsvaɪ̯təs buːχ|pron}}, "Second Book"), unofficially published in English as '''''Hitler's Secret Book''''' and then officially '''''Hitler's Second Book''''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-929631-16-2 Publishers Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt; is an unedited transcript of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s thoughts on [[foreign policy]] written in 1928; it was written after ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and was not published in his lifetime. The ''Zweites Buch'' was not published in 1928 because ''Mein Kampf'' did not sell well at that time and Hitler's publisher, [[Franz-Eher-Verlag]], told Hitler that a second book would hinder sales even more.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Adam Tooze]] (2007): [[The Wages of Destruction]]: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy. London. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Zweites Buch'' and ''Mein Kampf''==
{{Further|Nazi Foreign Policy (debate)}}

There are a number of similarities and differences between ''Zweites Buch'' and ''Mein Kampf''. As in ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler declared that the [[Jews]] were his eternal and most dangerous opponents. As in ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler outlined what the German historian [[Andreas Hillgruber]] has called his ''Stufenplan'' ("stage-by-stage plan"). Hitler himself never used the term ''Stufenplan'', which was coined by Hillgruber in his 1965 book ''Hitlers Strategie''. Briefly, the ''Stufenplan'' called for three stages. In the first stage, there would be a massive military build-up, the overthrow of the shackles of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and the forming of alliances with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] and the [[British Empire]]. The second stage would be a series of fast, "[[blitzkrieg|lightning wars]]" in conjunction with Italy and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] against France and whichever of her allies in Eastern Europe—such as [[Czechoslovakia]], Poland, [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]]—chose to stand by her. The third stage would be a war to obliterate what Hitler considered to be the "[[Judeo-Bolshevik]]" regime in the [[Soviet Union]].

In contrast to ''Mein Kampf'', in ''Zweites Buch'' Hitler added a fourth stage to the ''Stufenplan''. He insinuated that in the far future a struggle for [[Hegemony|world domination]] might take place between the [[United States]] and a European alliance comprising a new association of nations, consisting of individual states with high national value.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler, Adolf; Weinberg, Gerhard L. (editor) (2003). ''Hitler's second book: the unpublished sequel to Mein Kampf'', p. 227. Enigma.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zweites Buch'' also offers a different perspective on the U.S. than that outlined in ''Mein Kampf''. In the latter, Hitler declared that Germany's most dangerous opponent on the international scene was the [[Soviet Union]]; in ''Zweites Buch'', Hitler declared that for immediate purposes, the [[Soviet Union]] was still the most dangerous opponent, but that in the long-term, the most dangerous potential opponent was the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hillgruber, Andreas ''Germany and the Two World Wars'', Harvard University Press: Cambridge, 1981 pages 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lebensraum ==

In the first two chapters Hitler proclaims the balance between population and natural resources to be the main focus of any nation, and he gives it a far-reaching and detailed analysis.

The starting point of his analysis is the "struggle for daily bread" (food production) as the basis of human society. From this need for self-preservation, he develops his central idea of the relationship between the population and the size of the habitat of a people. If the habitat cannot provide sufficient resources for survival, degeneration and a decline of the nation results. Hitler raises the struggle for adequate habitat to a central principle of human history. Hitler points out that this battle is often enforced militarily, as history has adequately demonstrated.

As solutions to the struggle for living space, Hitler considers birth control, emigration of the population, increased food production, and increased exports to buy additional food. All of these alternatives he finds problematic. Birth control and emigration he believes leads to a weakening of the nation, as people are the true life-blood of the nation. The increase of food production he declares to be fundamentally limited by a finite amount of productive land. Greater exports he discards because it leads to increased market competition with other nations, making Germany dependent on outside nations and therefore leading to the situation Germany faced with the start of World War I in 1914. Hitler revisits these arguments several times in subsequent chapters.

== Foreign policy ==
In the other chapters Hitler developed his thoughts on the future National Socialist foreign policy that serves the struggle for living space. As in ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler explains that the Jews are the eternal and most dangerous opponents of the German people; he also outlines and elaborates on his future political plans.

In ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler mentioned the United States only occasionally and even with contempt. They were, to him, a "racially degenerate" society that will continue to see its demise. In his second book, however, Hitler describes the United States as a dynamic and "racially successful" society that has eugenics, racial segregation practices, and an exemplary immigration policy at the expense of "inferior" immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. Why this change occurred in Hitler's attitude between 1924 and 1928 is unknown. Historians have noted that Hitler was notoriously poorly informed about the world outside Germany and, at the time of the writing of ''Mein Kampf'', he probably knew little about the United States.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Hitler's knowledge of the U.S. came especially from the Western novels of [[Karl May]] he read.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} This seems to have changed by 1928; Hitler would have heard of the prosperity and industrialization in the United States, as well as the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], and the forced sterilization concept for supposedly mentally retarded people in several states. Hitler stated his admiration for such measures, as well as his wish that Germany should adopt similar policies on a larger scale.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Hitler stated that National Socialist foreign policy was to be based on Lebensraum for the German people:
{{quote|The National Socialist Movement, on the contrary, will always let its foreign policy be determined by the necessity to secure the space necessary to the life of our Folk. It knows no Germanising or Teutonising, as in the case of the national bourgeoisie, but only the spread of its own Folk. It will never see in the subjugated, so called Germanised, Czechs or Poles a national, let alone Folkish, strengthening, but only the racial weakening of our Folk.&lt;ref&gt;Zweites Buch, p.143&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Ideas on international relations==
Of all of Germany's potential enemies comprising the [[Allies of World War II]], Hitler ranked the U.S. as the most dangerous. By contrast, Hitler saw the United Kingdom as a fellow "[[Aryan race|Aryan]]" power that in exchange for Germany's renunciation of naval and colonial ambitions would ally itself with Germany. France, in Hitler's opinion, was rapidly "[[Negro]]izing" itself. In regard to the Soviet Union, Hitler dismissed the Russian people as being [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] ''[[Untermenschen]]'' ("sub-humans") incapable of intelligent thought. Hitler consequently believed that the Russian people were ruled by what he regarded as a gang of bloodthirsty but inept Jewish revolutionaries.

===United Kingdom===
In ''Zweites Buch'', Hitler called for an Anglo-German alliance based on political expediency as well as the notion that the two Germanic powers were natural allies. In ''Zweites Buch'', Hitler argued that the alleged British striving for a balance of power leading to an Anglo-German alliance would not conflict with his goal of Germany being the dominant continental power because it was wrong to believe that "England fought every [[hegemony|hegemonic]] power immediately", but rather was prepared to accept dominant states whose aims were "obviously and purely continental in nature".&lt;ref&gt;Jäckel, Eberhard ''Hitler's World View'' page 41&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler went on to write that "Of course no one in Britain will conclude an alliance for the good of Germany, but only in the furtherance of British interests."&lt;ref&gt;Strobl, Gerwin ''The Germanic Isle'' page 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, because Hitler believed that there was an ongoing struggle between the "Jewish invasion" and the "old British tradition" for the control of the United Kingdom, Hitler believed the chances for Anglo-German alliance to be good provided the "Jewish invasion" was resisted successfully.&lt;ref name="Leitz, Christian page 35"&gt;Leitz, Christian ''Nazi Foreign Policy'' page 35&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler hedged somewhat, however, by claiming that

{{quote|The instincts of Anglo-Saxondom are still so sharp and alive that one cannot speak of a complete victory of Jewry, but rather, in part the latter is still forced to adjust its interests to those of the English. If the Jew were to triumph in England, English interests would recede into the background.... [But] if the Briton triumphs then a shift of England's attitude ''vis-à-vis'' Germany can still take place."&lt;ref name="Leitz, Christian page 35" /&gt;}}

==English publication history==
The book was said to be "pirated", poorly translated in English, and then unofficially published as ''Hitler's Secret Book'' in 1962. More than forty years later, it was re-released "officially" in 2003 as ''Hitler's Second Book'' with newer translation by [[Gerhard Weinberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://endeavors.unc.edu/spr2005/weinberg.php Endeavors.unc.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;
