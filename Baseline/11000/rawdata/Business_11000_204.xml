[[File:Grave of Benjamin Blyth, Grange Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Grave of Benjamin Blyth, Grange Cemetery]]
'''Benjamin Hall Blyth''' (14 July 1819 – 21 August 1866) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[civil engineer]].&lt;ref name="DSA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000434 |title=Dictionary of Scottish Architects entry |access-date=5 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719012038/http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000434 |archive-date=19 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Blyth was born at 26 Minto St in [[Newington, Edinburgh]]&lt;ref&gt;Old Parish Record of birth/christening&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Robert Brittain Blyth, an iron merchant, and his wife, Barbara Cooper. He was their third son, and the first to survive to adulthood.

Blyth was trained as a railway engineer under an apprenticeship with Grainger &amp; [[John Miller (engineer)|Miller]], a railway contractor. In 1848 he established an engineering practice on the prestigious [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]] (at no 124) in [[Edinburgh]] where it would remain for the next 100 years. In 1854, after his brother Edward Lawrence Ireland Blyth finished his own apprenticeship with Grainger &amp; Miller, Benjamin took him into partnership of the renamed ''B &amp; E Blyth''.

The practice did work for the [[Caledonian Railway|Caledonian]], [[Glasgow and South Western Railway|Glasgow and South Western]], [[Scottish Central Railway|Scottish Central]], [[Dundee and Perth Railway|Dundee and Perth]], [[Great North of Scotland Railway|Great North of Scotland]] and [[Portpatrick Railway|Portpatrick]] railway companies.&lt;ref name="DSA" /&gt;

Blyth was a first cousin of [[Arthur Blyth]], who was three times premier of South Australia in the 19th century. Their fathers were brothers.&lt;ref name="Blyth, E.L.I 1893"&gt;Blyth, E.L.I. 1893, The family of Blythe or Blyth of Norton and Birchet&lt;/ref&gt;

Blyth married Mary Dudgeon Wright in Leith, Edinburgh, on 1 August 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Marriage certificate, held by Scottish records office&lt;/ref&gt; They initially lived at 26 Minto Street in the south of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1850-51&lt;/ref&gt; Mary took on clerical duties in the early stages of Blyth's company.&lt;ref&gt;Blyth and Blyth: The First 100 Years, historical records held by company&lt;/ref&gt; From 1854 they lived at 12 Hope Terrace, Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westblacket.org.uk/rhcontent/people.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Blyth died from diabetes&lt;ref&gt;Death certificate, held by Scottish records office&lt;/ref&gt; aggravated by overwork at home in [[North Berwick]] on 21 August 1866 and is buried in the [[Grange, Edinburgh|Grange Cemetery]], being survived by his wife, seven sons and two daughters.&lt;ref name="DSA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blyth, E.L.I 1893" /&gt;

His wife died of meningitis in 1868, and their children were subsequently brought up by his wife's sister, Elizabeth Scotland Wright. His eldest son [[Benjamin Blyth II]] took over his father's practice&lt;ref name="son"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000436 |title=Dictionary of Scottish Architects son's entry |access-date=5 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719012137/http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000436 |archive-date=19 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company remains in business to this day as Blyth and Blyth.&lt;ref name="Blyth"&gt;[http://www.blythandblyth.co.uk/about.php Blyth and Blyth]&lt;/ref&gt;

His house served as the offices of [[Scottish Natural Heritage]] between 1950 and 2003 then reverted to its use as a family home.&lt;ref name="house"&gt;[http://www.edinburgharchitecture.co.uk/hope_terrace_grange.htm Edinburgh Architecture entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chocnut display.jpg|thumb|Packets of Choc Nut for sale at a 'Filipino' Store in Sydney, Australia.]]

King '''Choc Nut''' (or '''tsoknat''') is a chocolate product manufactured by Unisman and later, Annie’s Sweets Manufacturing and Packaging Corporation.&lt;ref name="loresco"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loresco|first1=Shadz|title=Where's My Choc Nut?|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/features/95562-king-choc-nut-supply-demand|website=rappler.com|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originated in the Philippines and has endured as one of the country’s most consumed children's snacks. While only mass-produced in the Philippines, many ‘Filipino stores’ abroad sell the item. Ingredients of Choc Nut include coconut milk., crushed peanuts and cocoa powder, resulting in a distinct nutty taste and crumbly texture. &lt;ref name="loresco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verdolaga"/&lt;ref name="quiogue"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quiogue|first1=Monette|title=Going Nuts Over Choc Nut|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/15437/going-nuts-over-choc-nut/|website=inquirer.net|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing history ==

King Choc Nut was originally manufactured by a company called Unisman (New Unity Sweets Manufacturing Corporation) in Malabon. However, the new information on the packaging indicates that the product has now been bought out by Annie’s Sweets, the rival company that produced Hany, a chocolate bar with similar ingredients. &lt;ref name="loresco"/&gt; [[File:Chocnut pack.jpg|thumb|Details of King Choc Nut's new manufacturer printed on the outside of the packet]]

== Distribution ==

Choc Nut was usually available in convenience (sari-sari) stores and could be bought individually. However, some time after the brand was acquired  by Annie’s Sweets, Choc Nut began to dwindle in supply, being replaced in most grocery and convenience stores by chocolate bar with similar taste and ingredients called Hany.&lt;ref name="loresco"/&gt; Today Choc Nut is predominantly found in supermarkets where they can be purchased by the pack. The brand is also imported to overseas retailers such as ‘Filipino stores’ popular in other countries around the world, where they are sold alongside various local products.&lt;ref name="quiogue"/&gt;

== Packaging ==

A pack of Choc Nut contains 24 pieces individually wrapped in silver foil and white paper, later plastic, on the outer side bearing the logo and signature red stripes. The packs are a bronze colour with white and red lines running through it horizontally.

In the early days of its manufacturing, Choc Nut wrappers printed promos or collectibles on the inside of the wrapper. This was eventually discontinued.&lt;ref name="quiogue"/&gt;

'''Craig S. Fleisher''' is a scholar, 
advisor and author who has written or edited several important books in the fields of public affairs, business insight and competitive intelligence and [[Competitor analysis|analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;(Amazon.com, 2008; JCIM, 2003 volume 1)&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the Business School at the [[College of Coastal Georgia]], he was awarded two endowed research chair positions while a Professor of Business (Strategy &amp; Environment) at the [[Odette School of Business]], [[University of Windsor]], [[Ontario]], Canada. His research addresses phenomena in the areas of business and [[competitive intelligence]], [[Public Affairs Council|corporate public affairs]] (government relations and [[lobbying]]), and performance management and measurement. Since 2011 Dr. Fleisher has served as the Chief Learning Officer of Aurora WDC, a 20+ year old professional services firm (PSF) headquartered in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;(aurorawdc.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background, education and academic career==
Fleisher received his PhD in Business from the [[Katz Graduate School of Business]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], his MBA in Human Resource Management and Marketing from the [[Vanderbilt University Owen Graduate School of Management|Owen Graduate School of Management]], Vanderbilt University, and BSBA in Finance, Insurance and Real Estate from the [[University of Florida]]. He also held positions in mortgage banking management, [[real estate appraisal]], and management consulting at various points in his career. After getting his PhD, he took an appointment at the [[University of Calgary]] as Associate Professor in the Policy and Environment area, spent nearly a decade in various professorial and program leadership roles at the School of Business and Economics at [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] in [[Waterloo, Ontario]], and was at the [[University of Windsor]] in endowed chair position for nearly a decade, following a couple of years in decanal positions at the [[University of New Brunswick]]. He serves as an Adjunct Professor in Business Information Management at [[Tampere University of Technology]] (Finland), Adjunct Professor at the [[Wisconsin School of Business]], [[University of Wisconsin]] in Madison, imember of the graduate faculty for the Executive MScom at the [[Università della Svizzera italiana]] in [[Lugano, Switzerland]], has also served as a visiting professor or scholar at the [[University of Sydney]] ([[Australia]]), [[De Montfort University]] (Leicester, UK), [[University of Western Sydney]]¨and [[University of Waikato]] (Hamilton, New Zealand), among others.

He is considered an expert in the business or [[competitive intelligence]] and analysis area&lt;ref&gt;(Dishman, Fleisher &amp; Knip, 2002; Fleisher, Wright &amp; Tindale, 2007; Fleisher, Knip &amp; Dishman, 2003; Knip, Dishman, &amp; Fleisher, 2003;&lt;/ref&gt; based on the number of cited pieces (see [[Google Scholar]] for the most current citation counts of his work) he has written or the level of sales his writings have achieved, as well as in the area of corporate public affairs&lt;ref&gt;(Allen, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; where his books have been positively reviewed or named as best-sellers by leading associations and groups in the field. He was globally recognized for his lifetime contributions to the field of competitive intelligence by being named the Meritorious award winner and Fellow of the [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] (Alexandria, Virginia, USA),&lt;ref&gt;(SCIP, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; and his efforts in graduate teaching led him to be named one of Canada's top MBA professors by ''[[Canadian Business Magazine]]'' in 2006. He has been interviewed about his expertise and research by leading media outlets for magazines, narrow-cast web publications, newspaper, radio and television in a variety of countries, most notably Australia, Canada, and the USA.

==Research and writing==
Fleisher's academic research primarily focuses on two distinct areas of business activity, business and competitive intelligence, and corporate public affairs. Fleisher's dissertation was in the area of measuring public affairs performance,&lt;ref&gt;Fleisher, Craig (1991). "''Modeling the Role of Evaluation and Measurement in the Achievement of Corporate Public Affairs Management Effectiveness''" (OCLC: 28924435), 1991, Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh&lt;/ref&gt; and his research on public affairs benchmarking, performance measurement, and management is among the most cited according to [[Google Scholar]] in this field.&lt;ref&gt;Dishman, Fleisher, &amp; Knip, 2003; Fleisher, Wright &amp; Tindale, 2007; Fleisher, Knip &amp; Dishman, 2003; Knip, Dishman, &amp; Fleisher, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; His two books on these topics, published in 1995 and 1998 by the [[Public Affairs Council]] which is headquartered in [[Washington, DC]] were recognized as the Council's best-sellers at their time. His other major contributions in the field of corporate and public affairs are the two scholarly handbooks "The SAGE Handbook of International Corporate and Public Affairs" in 2017 and the ''Handbook of Public Affairs'' ([[SAGE Publications|Sage]], 2005) with his colleague Dr. Phil Harris from [[University of Chester]], [[United Kingdom]].

Since 2000, Fleisher is well known for his work in the area of business insights and [[competitive intelligence]], particularly in pushing for the professionalization of the field.&lt;ref&gt;(Fleisher, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; He published 3 edited volumes with his [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] [[Marketing]] professorial colleague David Blenkhorn, those being ''Managing Frontiers in Competitive Intelligence'' in 2001 (Quorum Books, an imprint of the [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]),  ''Controversies in Competitive Intelligence'' published in 2003 and ''Global Business and Competitive Intelligence'' in 2005 by [[Praeger Publishers]].

The only [[Canadians|Canadian]] Winner of the international [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] Meritorious Award for his lifetime contributions to the field of competitive intelligence, he may be best known for his two books looking at analysis methods used by consultants and practitioners in applied strategy. This included ''Strategic and Competitive Analysis'' with his colleague and fellow SCIP Meritorious Award winner [[Babette Bensoussan]] [[(Prentice Hall]], 2003) and ''Business and Competitive Analysis'' also with Bensoussan, (2Ed., [[Pearson PLC]], 2015, and [[FT Press]], 2007), and "Analysis without Paralysis" (w/Bensoussan, 2nd Ed., [[FT Press]], 2015). These books provided background and application information for over 50 separate methods of understanding business phenomena and competition,&lt;ref&gt;(Fleisher &amp; Bensoussan, 2003; Fleisher &amp; Bensoussan, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from popular methods like [[SWOT analysis]], financial ratio &amp; statement analysis, [[critical success factor]] analysis, issue analysis, and S-curves to less popular but no less important methods including business model analysis, linchpin analysis, and alternative competing hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;(Booknews, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; These books also address [[competitor analysis]].

==Other professional experience==
In addition to his work in academia, Fleisher has served as President of the [[Board of Directors]] of the [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] ([[Alexandria, Virginia]], USA), inaugural chair of the Competitive Intelligence Foundation (Washington, DC) - an organization that he also founded and helped launch with then SCIP Executive Director Alexander Graham, President of the Canadian Council for Public Affairs Advancement, Editor of the ''Journal of Competitive Intelligence and Management'', Associate Editor of the ''Journal of Public Affairs'' published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], and on the editorial boards of the ''International Journal of Technology Intelligence and Planning'' (Inderscience Publishers), ''Asia Pacific Public Relations Journal'', ''South African Journal of Information Management'', ''Competitive Intelligence Review'', ''Public Affairs'', and SCIP Online. He is also a long-time contributor to the Academy of Management's Social Issues in Management division, a founding member of the International Association of Business and Society, a life member of the [[International Association of Business Communicators]], an academic board member of the European Centre for Public Affairs, and a 2007 Canadian award-winning faculty advisor for the [[Golden Key International Honour Society]].

Fleisher also speaks globally on his research, having been to over two score different countries in a variety of roles ranging from key-noting conferences and meetings to serving as an authoritative panel member. He regularly shares his research and expertise to corporate groups, executive audiences, professional and trade associations, as well as government departments and officials.&lt;ref&gt;(www.uwindsor.ca/business)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cross-docking''' is a practice in [[logistics]] of unloading materials from an incoming [[semi-trailer truck]] or [[railroad car]] and loading these materials directly into outbound trucks, trailers, or rail cars, with little or no storage in between. This may be done to change the type of conveyance, to sort material intended for different destinations, or to combine material from different origins into transport vehicles (or containers) with the same or similar destinations.

Cross-dock operations were pioneered in the US trucking industry in the 1930s{{cn|date=April 2014}}, and have been in continuous use in less-than-truckload (LTL) operations ever since. The US military began using cross-docking operations in the 1950s. Wal-Mart began using cross-docking in the retail sector in the late 1980s.

In the LTL trucking industry, cross-docking is done by moving cargo from one transport vehicle directly onto another, with minimal or no [[warehousing]]. In retail practice, cross-docking operations may utilize staging areas where inbound materials are sorted, consolidated, and stored until the outbound shipment is complete and ready to ship.

==Advantages of retail cross-docking==
* Streamlines the supply chain, from point of origin to point of sale
* Reduces labor costs through less inventory handling
* Reduces inventory holding costs by reducing storage times and potentially eliminating the need to retain safety stock
* Products reach the distributor, and consequently the customer, faster
* Reduces or eliminates warehousing costs
* May increase available retail sales space
* Less risk of inventory handling

==Disadvantages of cross-docking==
* Potential partners may not have the necessary storage capacities
* An adequate transport fleet is needed to operate
* A computerized logistics system is needed
* Additional freight handling can lead to product damage
* Labour costs are also incurred in the moving and shipping of stock

==Typical applications==
*"[[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|Hub and spoke]]" arrangements, where materials are brought in to one central location and then sorted for delivery to a variety of destinations
*Consolidation arrangements, where a variety of smaller shipments are combined into one larger shipment for economy of transport
*Deconsolidation arrangements, where large shipments (e.g., railcar lots) are broken down into smaller lots for ease of delivery

Retail cross-dock example: using cross-docking, Wal-Mart was able to effectively leverage its logistical volume into a core strategic competency.
* Wal-Mart operates an extensive satellite network of distribution centers serviced by company-owned trucks
* Wal-Mart's satellite network sends point-of-sale (POS) data directly to 4,000 vendors.
* Each register is directly connected to a satellite system sending sales information to Wal-Mart’s headquarters and distribution centers.

==Factors influencing the use of retail cross-docks==
* Cross-docking depends on continuous communication between suppliers, distribution centers, and all points of sale
* Customer and supplier geography, particularly when a single corporate customer has many multiple branches or using points
* Freight costs for the commodities being transported
* Cost of inventory in transit
* Complexity of loads
* Handling methods
* Logistics software integration between supplier(s), vendor, and shipper
* Tracking of inventory in transit

==Cross-dock facility design==
Cross-dock facilities are generally designed in an "I" configuration, which is an elongated rectangle. The goal in using this shape is to maximize the number of inbound and outbound doors that can be added to the facility while keeping the floor area inside the facility to a minimum. Bartholdi and Gue (2004) demonstrated that this shape is ideal for facilities with 150 doors or less. For facilities with 150–200 doors, a "T" shape is more cost effective. Finally, for facilities with 200 or more doors, the cost-minimizing shape is an "X".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = John J. | last1 = Bartholdi | first2 = Kevin R. | last2 = Gue | title = The Best Shape for a Crossdock | journal = [[Transportation Science]] | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | date = May 2004 | pages = 235–244 | doi = 10.1287/trsc.1030.0077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Double linking''' is an organizing principle developed by [[Gerard Endenburg]], a Dutch engineer, as part of the so-called [[sociocracy|sociocratic circular method]]. It operates as an extension of [[Rensis Likert]]'s (single) [[Linking pin model|linking pin]]. In the sociocratic approach, decision-making is structured in circles. Each circle is connected to the next higher circle by way of the functional leader (appointed in the next higher circle) and a representative chosen in the circle. Both the functional leader and the representative participate in policy decisions taken in the lower as well as higher circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles and Practices of Sociocracy|url=http://www.sociocracy.info/about-sociocracy/principles-and-practices-of-sociocracy/|publisher=Sociocracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Romme, A.G.L. (1996). "Making organizational learning work: consent and double linking between circles." European Management Journal, 14(1), 69-75.  doi:10.1016/0263-2373(95)00048-8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downtown Jacksonville''' is the historic core and [[central business district]] (CBD) of [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]] [[United States|USA]]. It comprises the earliest area of the city to be developed and is located in its geographic center along the narrowing point of the [[St. Johns River]]. There are various definitions of what constitutes Jacksonville's downtown; the one used by the city government and other entities defines it as including five districts: the Downtown Core (or Northbank), the [[Southbank, Jacksonville|Southbank]], [[LaVilla]], [[Brooklyn (Jacksonville)|Brooklyn]], and the Sports Complex. The area features offices for major corporations such as [[CSX Corporation]], [[Fidelity National Financial]], [[TIAA Bank]], [[Bank of America]], [[Prudential Financial]], [[Wells Fargo]], [[AT&amp;T]], and [[Aetna]].

==History==
[[File:Map of Jacksonville and vicinity, Florida, (showing defenses). Surveyed April 1864. (Signed) Wm. H. Dennis, U. S.... - NARA - 305631.jpg|thumb|left|Jacksonville, April 1864]]

The site of modern Downtown Jacksonville originated at a crossing of the [[St. Johns River]] known to the [[Seminole]] as ''Wacca Pilatka'', to the Spanish as the ''Pass de San Nicolas'', and to later British settlers as the Cow Ford. Histories of the city report that there was once an Indian village at the site called Ossachite. White settlement in the area began during Florida's [[British Florida|British period]] (1763–1783), when the [[East Florida]] government built the King's Road to connect [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] with the British colonies to the north. A [[ferry]] and tavern were built, and when [[Spanish Florida|Spanish rule]] resumed in Florida, Fort San Nicolas was built beside the southern landing of the King's Road ferry. American farmer Robert Pritchard became the first white settler on the north bank of the Cow Ford when he received a 450-acre land grant from the Spanish government in 1791, however, he died shortly after and the area was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Downtown"/&gt;

The settlement that became Jacksonville largely formed from two land grants issued in 1816: one to Maria Taylor, née Suarez, and one to Juan LeMaestre. Over time a small settlement including some homes, an inn and a store grew at the Cow Ford, and in 1822, shortly after Spain ceded the Floridas to the United States, resident [[Isaiah D. Hart]] proposed establishing a town on the north bank. Hart eventually convinced his neighbors to join him in donating land for the venture, and the first streets were platted in June. The settlement was named "Jacksonville" after [[Andrew Jackson]], who had become popular among many Floridians for his actions in the [[First Seminole War]]. It was incorporated in 1832.&lt;ref name= Downtown/&gt;

The town grew in fits and starts: it saw disruption during the [[Second Seminole War]] (1835–1842), and the business district burned down in 1854 when sparks from the steamboat ''Florida'' started a fire. During the [[American Civil War]], Jacksonville was home to many [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] sympathizers, and was occupied for most of the war by Union troops who took the city four separate times. The war devastated Jacksonville and caused over half the population to flee. After the war, the city rebounded quickly when it became Florida's first major tourist destination; though tourism declined by the late 1880s growth and industry continued apace through the late 19th century.&lt;ref name= Downtown/&gt;

On May 3, 1901, downtown Jacksonville was ravaged by a fire that started at a fiber factory. Known as the [[Great Fire of 1901]], it was one of the worst disasters in Florida history and the largest urban fire in the southeastern United States. In just eight hours, it destroyed the business district and left approximately 10,000 residents homeless. Architect [[Henry John Klutho]] was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city.

==Geography==
Multiple definitions of Downtown Jacksonville are in common use. Often, the name "Downtown" is used exclusively for the historical core. This is bounded roughly by State Street to the north, Hogans Creek to the east, the [[St. Johns River]] to the south, and the [[LaVilla]] neighborhood to the west. This definition is used, for example, by the Jacksonville Historic Preservation Commission and their book, ''Jacksonville's Architectural Heritage''.&lt;ref name= Downtown&gt;{{cite book |title= Jacksonville's Architectural Heritage |last= Wood |first= Wayne |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1992|publisher= [[University Press of Florida]] |location= |isbn= 0-8130-0953-7|page= |pages= 22–29|url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the City of Jacksonville and other entities use a wider definition that includes not only the Downtown Core (also known as the Northbank), but surrounding areas on both sides of the river. In this definition, the boundaries are State Street to the north, the St. Johns River to the east, and [[Interstate 95 in Florida|Interstate 95]] to the south and west.&lt;ref name=DVI&gt;{{cite web |url= http://downtownjacksonville.org/downtownvisioninc/whoweare.aspx |title= Who We Are |author= |date= |work= downtownjacksonville.org |publisher= Downtown Vision, Inc. |accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area covers {{convert|1234|acre|ha sqmi|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://downtownjacksonville.org/Media/Publications.aspx |title= The State of Downtown: 2011 Progress Report |year= 2011 |page= 2|publisher= Downtown Vision, Inc. |accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown Vision, Inc., which oversees Jacksonville's [[downtown improvement district]], covers an even smaller area of about 90 blocks in the Downtown Core and Southbank, bounded by Church Street in the north, Market Street in the east, Prudential Drive in the south, and Broad Street in the west.&lt;ref name=DVI/&gt;

Under the broader definition, Downtown Jacksonville is divided into several districts or neighborhood. In addition to the historical Downtown Core, the most commonly used districts are: the Southbank, a commercial and residential district directly across the St. Johns River from the Downtown Core; [[LaVilla]], a historically [[African-American neighborhood]] west of the Downtown Core; [[Brooklyn (Jacksonville)|Brooklyn]], to the southwest of the Downtown Core; and the Stadium District, an area containing the city's major sports and entertainment venues to the east of the Downtown Core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.coj.net/Departments/Office-of-Economic-Development/Docs/Downtown-Development/1--jacksonville-master-plansmall-copy.aspx |title= Celebrating the River: A Plan for Downtown Jacksonville |format=PDF |year= 2000 |work= www.coj.net |publisher= City of Jacksonville |accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] encompassing a significant portion of downtown Jacksonville was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2016.  Its boundaries are roughly Beaver Street to the north, Catherine and Liberty Streets to the east, the St. Johns River to the south, and North Pearl Street to the west.  This area is significant for its pre-1965 architecture, most of which post-dates Jacksonville's great 1901 fire.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/16000212.pdf|title=NRHP nomination for Downtown Jacksonville Historic District|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Districts of Downtown Jacksonville===
[[File:Lauraforsyth.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1|Corner of [[Laura Street|Laura]] and Forsyth Streets located in the Northbank Core]]
===Downtown Core===
Also known as the '''Northbank''', is Jacksonville's traditional city center and what most people associate with Downtown and Jacksonville in general. It is the location of many government offices, including [[Jacksonville City Hall|City Hall]],  the [[Jacksonville Sheriff's Office]] headquarters, and the [[Bryan Simpson United States Courthouse]], and amenities such as the [[Jacksonville Main Library]], the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville]], the [[Jacksonville Landing]], and [[Jacksonville Riverwalk]]. Several of the city's largest skyscrapers are located there, such as the [[Bank of America Tower (Jacksonville)|Bank of America Tower]], the [[Wells Fargo Center (Jacksonville)|Wells Fargo Center]], [[TIAA Bank Center]], and the [[SunTrust Tower]], and are home to some of the city's major employers, such as [[TIAA Bank]] and [[CSX Corporation]].

:The Downtown Core is sometimes further divided into additional, smaller districts. Downtown Vision, Inc. refers to the blocks to north of Church Street and west of Liberty Street as the "Downtown Periphery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://downtownjacksonville.org/Media/Publications.aspx |title= The State of Downtown: 2011 Progress Report |year= 2011 |page= 26|publisher= Downtown Vision, Inc. |accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Jacksonville's Downtown Master Plan further restricts the "Central Civic Core" to south of Church Street and east of Main Street, separating the rest of the area into other districts.&lt;ref name=CCCD&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.coj.net/Departments/Office-of-Economic-Development/Docs/Downtown-Development/1--jacksonville-master-plansmall-copy.aspx |title= Celebrating the River: A Plan for Downtown Jacksonville |format=PDF |year= 2000 |work= www.coj.net |publisher= City of Jacksonville |pages= 26–27 |accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The Cathedral District is located in the northeast corner, near Hogans Creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coj.net/departments/office-of-economic-development/docs/downtown-development/cathedral.aspx |title= Downtown Jacksonville Master Plan |accessdate=2012-12-14 |work= City Of Jacksonville}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mixed-used neighborhood is home to many of Jacksonville's landmark churches, including [[St. John's Cathedral (Jacksonville, Florida)|St. John's Episcopal Cathedral]], the [[Mount Zion AME Church (Jacksonville)|Mount Zion AME Church]], [[Immaculate Conception Catholic Church (Jacksonville)|Immaculate Conception Catholic Church]], First Presbyterian Church, and the First United Methodist Church. Due to the area's close proximity to the former courthouse many of the residential structures have been converted into attorneys' offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2007-may-exploring-downtowns-cathedral-district |title=Exploring Downtown's Cathedral District|accessdate=2012-12-14 |work= Metro Jacksonville }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The Riverfront District, also known as the East Bay Street District and other names, exists in the southwest corner of the Downtown Core, centered on East Bay Street. This area was historically industrial before the abandonment of the Jacksonville Shipyards and related industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2011-jun-remembering-the-east-bay-street-district |title=Remembering The East Bay Street District |publisher=Metro Jacksonville |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city subsequently zoned much of the area for entertainment, commercial, and residential uses, creating the "Bay Street Entertainment Zone" on Bay Street. In 2011 the entertainment zoning was rebranded the "E-Town Zone" and expanded to include parts of Ocean, Adams and Forsyth Streets, covering much of the historical East Bay Street District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.coj.net/Departments/Office-of-Economic-Development/Docs/Downtown-Development/1--jacksonville-master-plansmall-copy.aspx |title= Celebrating the River: A Plan for Downtown Jacksonville |format=PDF |year= 2000 |work= www.coj.net |publisher= City of Jacksonville |page= 33 |accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jaxdailyrecord1"&gt;{{cite web|author=06/08/2011 |url=http://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/showstory.php?Story_id=533771 |title=In the zone: JEDC wants to expand Bay Street entertainment area |publisher=Jaxdailyrecord.com |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Riverplace Tower, Jacksonville, FL, US.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Riverplace Tower]] located in Southbank]]

===[[Southbank (Jacksonville)|Southbank]]=== 
A mixed commercial and residential district on the southern shore of the St. Johns River, directly across from the Northbank. It is closely associated with (and sometimes considered part of) Jacksonville's [[San Marco (Jacksonville)|San Marco]] neighborhood. It includes large office towers such as the [[Aetna Building]], Riverplace Tower, and Baptist Medical Center. Residential towers include [[The Peninsula at St. Johns Center|The Peninsula]], [[The Strand at St. Johns Center|The Strand]], and San Marco Place. There are six major hotels on the Southbank, including Crowne Plaza Jacksonville Riverfront and Wyndham Jacksonville Riverwalk as well as amenities such as the [[Museum of Science and History]], [[Friendship Fountain]] and the [[Jacksonville Riverwalk|Southbank Riverwalk]]. Though historically poorly designed for pedestrians, the city hopes to better integrate it with the rest of Downtown as well as San Marco.&lt;ref name="jaxdailyrecord1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.coj.net/Departments/Office-of-Economic-Development/Docs/Downtown-Development/1--jacksonville-master-plansmall-copy.aspx |title= Celebrating the River: A Plan for Downtown Jacksonville |format=PDF |year= 2000 |work= www.coj.net |publisher= City of Jacksonville |pages= 34–35 |accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[LaVilla]]=== 
A district immediately west of the Downtown Core. Jacksonville's first suburb, the predominantly African-American neighborhood was an independent municipality until being annexed in 1887. The area of the neighborhood north of Adams Street emerged as a mecca of African-American culture, and was home to many venues showcasing black performers, such as the [[Ritz Theatre (Jacksonville)|Ritz Theatre]]. The southern part of the neighborhood was a major [[railroad]] hub and was also Jacksonville's chief [[red light district]] for a period.&lt;ref name=woodlavilla&gt;Wood 1992, pp. 86–89&lt;/ref&gt;

:The neighborhood went into serious decline in the 1960s, and has not recovered. [[Urban renewal]] projects commenced in the 1980s, resulting in the loss of many buildings. More recent projects have aimed at bringing commercial development and public amenities to the area.&lt;ref name="jaxdailyrecord1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=woodlavilla/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downtownjacksonville.org/DowntownVisionInc/HistoryOfDowntown/HistoryOfDowntownLaVilla.aspx |title= History of LaVilla |accessdate=2012-09-16 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.coj.net/Departments/Office-of-Economic-Development/Docs/Downtown-Development/1--jacksonville-master-plansmall-copy.aspx |title= Celebrating the River: A Plan for Downtown Jacksonville |format=PDF |year= 2000 |work= www.coj.net |publisher= City of Jacksonville |pages= 22–23|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Brooklyn (Jacksonville)|Brooklyn]]=== 
Located at the far southwestern corner of downtown, it comprises the area south of Lavilla and north and west of [[Interstate 95 in Florida|Interstate 95]]. Originally a residential suburb, it was annexed into Jacksonville in 1887. It is connected to Jacksonville's [[Riverside (Jacksonville)|Riverside]] neighborhood by Riverside Avenue. It is home to [[Fidelity National Financial]], [[TIAA Bank]], and [[FIS (company)|FIS]] corporate headquarters, and other offices.

:Commercial and industrial uses became prominent in the 20th century, and many commercial office buildings were constructed along the river.  Subsequently, a rift emerged between the office-centered part of the neighborhood on the river and the traditional neighborhood further inland. As a result, in the 21st century the city re-introduced residential zoning and the neighborhood has become the site of [[mixed-use]] developments.&lt;ref name="jaxdailyrecord1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.coj.net/Departments/Office-of-Economic-Development/Docs/Downtown-Development/1--jacksonville-master-plansmall-copy.aspx |title= Celebrating the River: A Plan for Downtown Jacksonville |format=PDF |year= 2000 |work= www.coj.net |publisher= City of Jacksonville |pages= 20–21 |accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downtownjacksonville.org/DowntownVisionInc/HistoryOfDowntown/HistoryOfDowntownJacksonvilleBrooklyn.aspx |title= History of Brooklyn |accessdate=2012-09-16 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.coj.net/Departments/Office-of-Economic-Development/Docs/Downtown-Development/1--jacksonville-master-plansmall-copy.aspx |title= Celebrating the River: A Plan for Downtown Jacksonville |format=PDF |year= 2000 |work= www.coj.net |publisher= City of Jacksonville |pages= 2–21|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stadium District=== 
Also known as the Sports Complex, is located east of the Downtown Core, and contains Jacksonville's major sporting and entertainment venues. Historically part of Jacksonville's [[Eastside (Jacksonville)|Eastside]], it is home to [[TIAA Bank Field]], the [[Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville]], [[Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena]], [[Daily's Place Amphitheater]], [[Metropolitan Park]], and the Greater Jacksonville Fair and Expo Center.&lt;ref name="jaxdailyrecord1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.coj.net/Departments/Office-of-Economic-Development/Docs/Downtown-Development/1--jacksonville-master-plansmall-copy.aspx |title= Celebrating the River: A Plan for Downtown Jacksonville |format=PDF |year= 2000 |work= www.coj.net |publisher= City of Jacksonville |pages= 31–32|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gator Bowl Stadium]] was razed in 1994.

For more than half a century he was the president of the store ''A l'innovation'' in [[Brussels]], which he founded in 1897 in [[Brussels]]. Soon other stores followed in [[Liège (city)|Liege]] (1899), [[Verviers]] (1900), [[Ghent]] (1900) and [[Antwerp]] (1906).

Besides being an entrepreneur he took several initiatives to support the arts and sciences. He founded the ''Bernheim Foundation'', the [[Belgian Vocation Foundation]] and the ''Centre Emile Bernheim'' (CEB) at the ''[[Universite Libre de Bruxelles]]''. He died at the age of 99.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1535">An '''End-user certificate''', or '''EUC''', is a document used in international transfers, including sales and arms provided as aid, of [[weapons]] and [[ammunition]] to certify that the buyer is the final recipient of the materials, and is not planning on transferring the materials to another party.  EUCs are required by many governments to restrict the flow of the materials to undesired destinations, such as [[embargo]]ed states or rebel groups, governments with bad human rights records or states which are considered a threat by the original supplier of the arms.

There are several problems with EUCs as a means to prevent undesirable [[arms exports]]. EUCs can be [[forgery|forged]] or falsified; they can also be obtained from [[corrupt]] officials, therefore there is a need for EUCs that are difficult to forge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.sipri.org/files/insight/SIPRIInsight1003.pdf |title=End-User Certificates: Improving standards to prevent diversion |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem is that an EUC does not guarantee that the arms recipient will actually live up to its promise not to re-transfer the weapons received. EUCs which are not backed up by proper end-use monitoring are weak. 

In 1936-1938, German arms were supplied to both sides in the [[Spanish Civil War]] via Greece using Greek then Mexican end-user certificates, see [[Pyrkal]].

}} 
'''Felipe Esteban Llavallol''' (December 26, 1802 — April 4, 1874) was an Argentine merchant, philanthropist, lawmaker and briefly Governor of the secessionist [[State of Buenos Aires]].

==Life and times==
Llavallol was born in [[Buenos Aires]] to María Gertrudis de Merlo and Jaime Llavallol; the elder Llavallol was a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] merchant from [[Barcelona]] who had emigrated to [[Buenos Aires]] in the 1790s, and Felipe Llavallol joined his father in business. He married the former Martina Monasterio in 1833, and they had seven children. He inherited his father's [[commerce|commercial]] establishment in 1838 and became one of Buenos Aires' leading businesspeople.

Following the September 11, 1852, declaration of the secessionist [[State of Buenos Aires]], Llavallol held numerous posts in the new government. He was elected to the Lower House of Congress, becoming President of the Chamber, and to the Senate in 1854, serving as its president until 1856. He was appointed Economy Minister and took part in the establishment of the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]] in 1854, and served as its first president until August 1855. Named President of the newly established [[Buenos Aires Western Railway]], he presided over the August 30, 1857, inaugural of its first line, designed by British engineer [[William Bragge]].

Elected Vice-Governor in [[Valentín Alsina]]'s ticket in December 1858, the defeat of Buenos Aires forces by those of the [[Argentine Confederation]] at the [[Battle of Cepeda (1859)]] led to Confederate President [[Justo José de Urquiza]]'s demand that Alsina resign, and the more pragmatic Llavallol succeeded Alsina as governor on October 23, 1859.

Governor Llavallol's brief tenure as governor was highlighted by the resulting negotiations, which produced the [[Pact of San José de Flores]] and significant concessions toward Buenos Aires. He stepped down on May 3, 1860, upon the legislature's election of Colonel [[Bartolomé Mitre]], who defeated Confederate forces at the 1861 [[Battle of Pavón]] and reincorporated Buenos Aires into a unified [[Argentina]].

Llavallol continued his work as a member of the ''Comisión Filantrópica'' [[charity organization]], and died in Buenos Aires in 1874, at age 71. He was interred in [[La Recoleta Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogiafamiliar.net/showmedia.php?mediaID=976&amp;medialinkID=3642|title= Genealogía familiar: Mausoleo familiar Llavallol|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2293">'''Fernand Hautain''' (1858–1942) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] businessman and governor of the [[National Bank of Belgium]] (NBB) from 1923 until 1926.

==Career==
He started his career at an early age, and combined working with evening classes and self-tuition. He started working for the NBB at the age of 19, as a bank clerk in the bank's branch in his home town of [[Nivelles]] and three years went on to work as a clerk at the Brussels head office. In 1901, Fernand Hautain was appointed an agent in [[Philippeville]] and then in [[La Louvière]], where in 1907 he became the manager of the discount office. As a businessman, he became commissioner for a several industrial limited companies. When [[World War I]] broke out, he was appointed as a director of the Bank and after the war, in 1923, he succeeded [[Leon Van der Rest]] as governor of the NBB.

During his term as governor, the Belgian government tried to deal with the postwar monetary crisis and to stabilise the [[belgian franc]]. In 1926, [[Emile Francqui]], as minister Minister without Portfolio was the architect of the reform plan which would solve the monetary crisis. The bad relationship between Emile Francqui and Fernand Hautain would lead to the dismissal of Fernand Hautain from office. He was succeeded by [[Louis Franck (politician)|Louis Franck]].

After his dismissal, Hautain returned to the business world, and he remained deputy administrator of the ''Société Nationale de Crédit à l'Industrie'', which he had helped to establish in 1919.

'''Harald "Harry" Gschoesser''' (born July 25, 1961) is an Austrian entrepreneur and musician. He is the founder of the social network for musicians, Speedgig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speedgig |url=http://www.speedgig.com/about | accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a former band drummer of [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]],&lt;ref name="Racer X band Info"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://racerxband.com/band.htm | title=Racer X band Info | accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an American heavy metal band based out of Los Angeles, and former drummer of Austrian rock bands No Bros and Speedy Weekend Band.

==Early life==
Gschoesser was born in Tirol, Austria. He started playing the drums at the late age of 17. He first attracted the attention of the Austrian band, Scream, with Andy Woerz, who later became an Austrian actor and singer. In 1981, Gschoesser started drumming for the Speedy Weekend Band, which became the most popular heavy metal band in Austria at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sra.at/band/1113 | title=Speedy Weekend Band Info | accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing all over Austria, they also opened for [[Eric Burdon]], [[Roger Chapman]], and others during their Austrian tour.

==History with No Bros==
After the Speedy Weekend Band broke up, Gschoesser was picked up by No Bros in 1983, an Austrian rock band. Managed by Gotthard Rieger, the band started recording later that year and released the album ''Our Own Way''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Bros History|url=http://www.nobros.com/history.htm|accessdate=June 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021054824/http://nobros.com/history.htm|archivedate=October 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, No Bros went on European tours with other bands such as [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]], [[Samson (band)|Samson]], Girlschool, and [[Ginger Baker]] and Band, who was the former drummer of [[Cream (band)|Cream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ginger-baker.eu/ |title=The Ginger Baker Site |publisher=Ginger-baker.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racer X==
In 1985, Gschoesser moved to Los Angeles and enrolled at the [[Musicians Institute]], where he met fellow students and future Racer X bandmates [[Paul Gilbert]] and [[Juan Alderete]]. Later that year, Paul Gilbert, who later helped form the popular band [[Mr. Big (band)|Mr. Big]], asked Gschoesser to be his drummer for [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]]. Soon after, Juan Alderete, came on as the bass player and later Jeff Martin as their singer.&lt;ref name="Racer X band Info"/&gt; Gilbert entered in a Guitar competition, Guitar Wars, with Gschoesser and Alderete at Gazzarries on the Sunset Strip. Racer X won the competition.&lt;ref name="popularity"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/bandsondemand/artist.aspx?artist=racerx&amp;cat=metal&amp;full=Racer%20X | title=Racer X Gains Popularity | accessdate=August 3, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615033950/http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/bandsondemand/artist.aspx?artist=racerx&amp;cat=metal&amp;full=Racer%20X | archivedate=June 15, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band started their recording process at Sun Parrier studio near San Francisco in 1985.&lt;ref name="Racer X band Info"/&gt; Since Gschoesser was only on a student visa, he was not allowed to record. The band received legal permission for Gschoesser to work for 24 hours. This allowed Gschoesser to record his drum sequence, while the rest of the band finished up the record in two weeks. After, Racer X released its debut album ''[[Street Lethal]]'' on January 1, 1986 on Mike Varney's [[Shrapnel Records]] label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shrapnelrecords.com/servlet/store?item=catalog&amp;action=viewproduct&amp;prodid=272 | title=Street Lethal release information | accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gschoesser left the band. Guitarist Bart Walsh, former member of David Lee Roth Band, connected Gschoesser with the American band Icebreaker. Gschoesser replaced the drummer, [[Eric Singer]]. The band performed at Los Angeles nightclubs [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|The Roxy]] and [[Whisky A Go Go]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10883">'''Ibar Esteban Pérez Corradi''' (born July 16, 1977), usually identified as '''Esteban Pérez Corradi''', is an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] pharmaceutical entrepreneur who has been imprisoned for [[narcotics trafficking]] and [[money laundering]] and suspected of connections with a [[triple crime]] that took place in Argentina in 2008. At the time of his capture, on June 19, 2016 in Paraguay, he had been at large since March 20, 2012

==Career==
After working for the National Bank from 1996 to 2002, during which time he also became involved in the narcotics trade, he became a successful financier in 2006.

He co-owns two firms, Odín Concept SRL, a pharmaceutical house, in which his partner is Pablo Héctor Quaranta, and C&amp;C Building, a construction company, in which his partner is Martín Eduardo Lanatta.

In May 2008, Pérez Corradi became president of Elaboradora de Productos Biológicos S.A., while his “right-hand man,” Jorge Cabrera, became director of the firm.&lt;ref name=not1&gt;{{cite web| title =Quién es Pérez Corradi, el hombre clave en el triple crimen de General Rodríguez | work =La Noticia| url =http://www.lanoticia1.com/noticia/quien-es-perez-corradi-el-profugo-del-triple-crimen-de-general-rodriguez-27694.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sepr&gt;{{cite web| title =Detienen a Pérez Corradi, el puente hacia Aníbal F. en torno al triple crimen de Gral.

==Drug trafficking==
He is said to have trafficked in illegal narcotics, including [[ephedrine]].&lt;ref name=perf&gt;{{cite web| title =Quién es Pérez Corradi, el principal sospechoso| work =Perfil| url =http://www.perfil.com/ediciones/domingo/-20123-662-0058.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source describes him as a member of a “cartel” that dealt in “precursor chemicals”;&lt;ref name=not1/&gt; another identifies him as a member of a “drug mafia.”&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web| title =La Corte concedió la extradición de Pérez Corradi a los EEUU| work =Infobae| url =http://www.infobae.com/2011/01/27/558908-la-corte-concedio-la-extradicion-perez-corradi-los-eeuu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that he got rich selling ephedrine to Mexicans, and that his suppliers were named Alfredo Abrahams and Josué Fucks (sic).&lt;ref name=goog&gt;{{Google books |id=EGvrZYVfsNsC |page=PR3-IA8 |title=La ejecución: La historia secreta del triple crimen que desnudó la conexión con la mafia de lo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The “drug mafia” or “cartel” to which Perez Corradi belongs has been linked to Argentine president [[Cristina Fernández]], a large percentage of whose campaign funds in 2007 came from pharmaceutical firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2009/09/04/noticia_0031.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924090342/http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2009/09/04/noticia_0031.html |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2009/09/26/noticia_0014.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924090358/http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2009/09/26/noticia_0014.html |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

At one time, Pérez Corradi reportedly worked “informally” in the laboratory of [[Biopharma]], a firm that contributed money to Cristina Kirchner's presidential campaign.&lt;ref name=sepr/&gt;

In recent years, Perez Corradi's name has been raised in connection with many drug trafficking cases.&lt;ref name=gace&gt;{{cite web| title =El empresario Ibar Perez Corradi es el primer liberado| work =Gaceta Mercantil| url =http://www.gacetamercantil.com/notas/11198/el-empresario-ibar-perez-corradi-es-primer-liberado.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after the so-called General Rodriguez triple murder (see below) in August 2008, he was one of several high-profile figures investigated for ephedrine trafficking and illegal trade in medicines that were the basis for ephedrine and [[crystal meth]].&lt;ref name=pultz&gt;{{cite web| title =Guinea Bissau: The Latin American connection| work =Pulitzer Center| url =http://pulitzercenter.org/blog/untold-stories/guinea-bissau-latin-american-connection-drug-trafficking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, ''La Nación'' reported that the Federal Court of [[San Isidro, Buenos Aires|San Isidro]] had ordered the extradition of Pérez Corradi to the [[United States]]. This order was a response to an order of capture issued by a court in the state of [[Maine]], which accused Pérez Corradi of having sent a parcel into the U.S. containing 80 [[oxycodone]] tablets, and which had led to the detention of Pérez Corradi on October 22, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1162652-ordenan-la-extradicion-de-perez-corradi-a-los-estados-unidos&lt;/ref&gt; A request for his release was rejected in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Rechazan libertad de Pérez Corradi| work =Marandu| url =http://www.momarandu.com/amanoticias.php?a=7&amp;b=1&amp;c=108220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, the ''Buenos Aires Clarin'' reported that the [[Argentinian Supreme Court]] had approved the extradition of Pérez Corradi to the United States on charges of trafficking in oxycodone, thus upholding the decision of the San Isidro court.&lt;ref name=info/&gt;

==Money laundering==
Pérez Corradi, according to one source, laundered money through the [[Guinea Bissau]] consulate in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name=pultz/&gt;

In December 2010, Judge Norberto Oyarbide indicted Pérez Corradi in Argentina for money laundering, in a case involving the assets of pharmaceutical entrepreneur [[Néstor Lorenzo]], arrested banking union leader Juan José Zanola, and the late Sebastian Forza. The charges also linked Pérez Corradi with ephedrine trafficking and with a case involving tampered medicine.&lt;ref name=info/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Jaime charged with corruption| work =Buenos Aires Herald| date =Dec 4, 2010| url =http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/53045/jaime-charged-with-corruption}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Pérez Corradi was placed in pretrial detention in Argentina on charges of money laundering.&lt;ref name=perf/&gt; On December 15, 2011, he was released from prison after paying a bail of 100,000 pesos.&lt;ref name=gace/&gt; At the time of his release, he was still facing the possibility of being extradited to the United States on drug trafficking charges.&lt;ref name=gace/&gt;

==Triple murder==
{{main|Triple crime}}
On August 7, 2008, Sebastián Forza, Damian Ferron, and Leopoldo Bina were murdered in a house in the Quilmes neighborhood of [[Buenos Aires]]. Their bodies were stored in a freezer and eventually thrown in a ditch in another part of the city, where they were found on August 13. The men were killed, according to one source, “in perfect mafia style,” and all three of them had ties to the pharmaceutical business. Peréz Corradi was reportedly in [[Cancún]] at the time of the triple murder.

On March 20, 2012, the [[Argentinian Ministry of Justice]] issued a warrant for Pérez Corradi in connection with the triple murder, of which he is believed to be the mastermind. During the succeeding months, several raids were conducted in various places but Pérez Corradi was not found. He remains a fugitive, and is named by [[Interpol]] as one of the world's most wanted fugitives.

On December 20, 2012, two pairs of brothers, Martin and Cristian Lanatta and Victor and Marcelo Schillaci, were convicted of participation in the crime and sentenced to life in prison. The motive, according to the court, was that Forza, Ferron, and Bina's efforts to become involved in drug trafficking had threatened the narcotics trade of Pérez Corradi and his business partner Martin Lanatta.&lt;ref name=goog/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201308/27948-a-cinco-anos-del-crimen-no-pueden-detener-al-profugo-perez-corradi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The triple murder is the subject of a book, ''La Ejecución: La historia secreta del triple crimen que desnudó la conexión con la mafia de los medicamentos y la recaudación de la campaña K'' (''The Execution: The Secret History of the Triple Murder that Laid Bare the Connection with the Pharmaceutical Mafia and the K Campaign Fund''). The book was written by Emilia Delfino and Rodrigo Alegre and published by [[Random House|Random House Mondadori]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=goog/&gt;

Corradi was reported detained in Paraguay on February 12, 2016;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1870449-detuvieron-a-ibar-perez-corradi-en-paraguay-segun-sus-abogados|title= Detuvieron a Ibar Pérez Corradi en Paraguay, según sus abogados|trans-title=Ibar Pérez Corradi was detained in Paraguay, according to his lawyers|language= Spanish|author= |date= February 12, 2016|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was reported later that he was still at large.

He was captured in the Triple Border on June 9, 2016, with a new paraguayan ID and with his fingerprints removed. The judges [[Sebastián Casanello]] and [[María Servini de Cubria]] asked for his extradition: Casanello works on the triple crime case, and Servini de Cubría on a case of drugs trafficking. Corradi refused t be extradited, claiming that he does not trust the Argentine judiciary, that his family is in Paraguay, and that his life would be at risk if he returns. As a result, the extradition request may take two months to be answered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1911017-ibar-perez-corradi-se-nego-a-un-proceso-abreviado-de-extradicion-y-se-demoraria-dos-meses-su-traslado-a-la-argentina|title= Ibar Pérez Corradi se negó a ser extraditado y apuntó contra el kirchnerismo y el juez Casanello|trans-title=Ibar Pérez Corradi refused to be extradited, and pointed to Kirchnerism and judge Casanello|language= Spanish|author= Ivan Ruiz|date= June 21, 2016|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Perez Corradi has been described as a man of few words who keeps a low profile. “He is not the sort who puts all his eggs in one basket.”&lt;ref name=goog/&gt; He and his ex-wife, Liliana Raquel Aurehhuliu, have three children.&lt;ref name=perf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uif.gov.ar/uif/index.php/es/noticias/475-nuevas-medidas-en-la-causa-contra-un-lavador-vinculado-a-la-mafia-de-medicamentos&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have a home in Pilar, in Buenos Aires, and another in [[Spain]], which has proven “very useful” in connection with the export of illicit substances to Europe.&lt;ref name=sepr/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3655">The '''International Annealed Copper Standard''' ('''IACS''') is a [[Standard (metrology)|standard]] established in 1914 by the United States Department of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |series=Circular of the Bureau of Standards No.31 |title=Copper Wire Tables, |date=October 1, 1914 |edition=3d |publisher=United States Department of Commerce |url=https://archive.org/details/copperwiretables31unituoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an empirically derived standard value for the [[electrical conductivity]] of commercially available [[copper]].

Sometime around 1913 several copper samples from 14 important refiners and wire manufacturers were analyzed by the [[U.S. Bureau of Standards]]. The average [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the samples was determined to be 0.15292 [[Ohm|Ω]] for copper wires with a mass of 1 [[gram]] of uniform [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] and 1 [[meter]] in length at 20&amp;nbsp;°C. In the United States this is usually written as "0.15292 ohm (meter, gram) at 20&amp;nbsp;°C".

Germany proposed a slight modification of this value to "0.15328 ohm (meter, gram) at 20&amp;nbsp;°C", this being equivalent to a conductivity of exactly {{val|58|e=6|u=[[Siemens (unit)|S]]|up=m}} at 20&amp;nbsp;°C. The German modification was adopted by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] in 1913 and subsequently published by the [[United States Department of Commerce]] on October 1, 1914 as the International Annealed Copper Standard (IACS).

The standard is most often used as a comparative property in the specification of the conductivity of other metals. For example, the conductivity of a particular grade of [[titanium]] may be specified as 1.2&amp;nbsp;% IACS, meaning that its electrical conductivity is 1.2&amp;nbsp;% of the copper specified as the IACS standard.&lt;ref&gt;

== Quality of aluminum alloys ==

[[Heat treatment]] will alter several properties of an alloy, many of which are important to a design engineer. A measurement of the electric conductivity of [[aluminum alloys]] can be used to verify that a heat treatment process has been done correctly.
For example a component made of "7075" alloy which was correctly treated with the process "T73" to gain resistance to [[stress corrosion cracking]] will fall in the range of 38.0 to 43.0&amp;nbsp;%&amp;nbsp;IACS.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance criteria for electrical conductivity of finished or semi-finished parts of wrought aluminum alloys are contained in [[SAE International]] specification AMS2658 Hardness and Conductivity Inspection of Wrought Aluminum Alloy Parts. Here the values are given in reference to the IACS.

A method for measuring electrical conductivity is described in [[ASTM International]] specification ASTM E 1004 Electromagnetic (Eddy-Current) Measurements of Electrical Conductivity. Electrical conductivity meters with direct readout in %IACS are commercially available&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''International Association for Technology Trade''' ('''IATT''') is a consortium of technology organizations, strategic advisors, government agencies and corporate members seeking to generate successful global business opportunities – with a key focus on [[China]] and [[emerging economies]]. IATT runs ongoing trade missions to developing regions, sponsors and co-promotes conferences and symposia, and provides strategic services to companies entering and expanding into [[emerging markets]].

==Recent noteworthy events==

===2006 Guangdong Province Educational Technology Buyers' Summit===

In June 2006, IATT hosted a high-level delegation from the '''[[Guangdong]] Province Department of Education''', visiting North America at summit meetings arranged by IATT in [[Toronto]], ON; [[Washington, DC]] and [[San Jose, CA]]. Highlights included meetings with representatives from '''[[Discovery Communications]]''', the [http://www.oraclefoundation.org '''Oracle Education Foundation'''] and '''[[Adobe Systems]]''' among other '''[[International Society for Technology in Education|ISTE]] 100''' companies. ISTE was a co-organizer of the summit, designed to introduce leading educational technology companies in North America to potential buyers in China.

===First Sino-American Forum of Intellectual Property Rights===

Efforts in 2005 to forge a partnership with the '''Patent Protection Association of China''' [http://ppac.org.cn/en/ '''(PPAC)'''] under the direction of China’s [[State Intellectual Property Office]] (SIPO) resulted in the first-ever ''Sino-American Forum of [[Intellectual Property]] Rights'', held in China’s booming [[Pearl River Delta]].&lt;ref&gt;Knezek, Don. [http://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=News_and_Events&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=9374" "CEO's Update on China Expo and Intellectual Property Forum"], ''ISTE - News &amp; Events'', October 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Attracting more than 500 government officials, business leaders and academics from throughout China and North America, IATT and PPAC co-organized the event.&lt;ref&gt;editor. [http://www.glosk.com/CH/Macao/-2657867/pages/Dongguan/69794_en.htm "Dongguan - Foreign Direct Investment"], ''Glosk.com'', November, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

“IP continues to be a critical issue between China and the West, but what is especially exciting about this forum is the growing importance Chinese business leaders place on their own intellectual property. SIPO is racing toward half-a-million [[patent application]]s in 2005, 80% filed domestically – and the greatest number coming from the Pearl River Delta. Ultimately, Chinese business’ urging of the central government to protect IP rights will make a difference, because now it’s in everyone’s best interests.” (David McKnight, IATT president – speaking with a reporter from [[CCTV-9]] in China, October 2005)

===2005 China Educational Technology Conference &amp; Expo===

During the same timeframe, and with its EdTech association partner ISTE,&lt;ref&gt;Knezek, Don. [https://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=News_and_Events&amp;CONTENTID=8190&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm "Letter from the CEO—ISTE in China"], ''ISTE - News &amp; Events'', October 7, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; IATT co-organized what was identified as the world's largest educational technology conference and expo in [[Dongguan]], attracting nearly 40,000 attendees in its first year with leading EdTech speakers and a small number of non-China exhibitors from the US, Canada and UK.&lt;ref&gt;editor.

[[File:Janice Marturano.jpg|thumb|Janice Marturano speaking at the 2014 World Economic Forum]]
'''Janice Marturano''' (born 1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-22480297.html |newspaper=The Record |location=Bergen County, NJ |date=June 20, 1995 |via=HighBeam Research |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an author, former vice president at [[General Mills]], and founder and executive director of the Institute for Mindful Leadership, a non-profit organization that educates business and organizational employees on strengthening the fundamentals of leadership excellence through [[mindfulness]] meditation, contemplative leadership practices and their practical applications in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instituteformindfulleadership.org/founder/ |title=Founder |website=Institute for Mindful Leadership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Marturano grew up in [[Clifton, New Jersey]], the child of first generation Italian immigrant parents. She graduated with a [[Juris Doctor]] (JD) from [[NYU School of Law]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/news-events/beyond-deep-breaths-transforming-workplace-through-mindfulness|title = NYU Hosts Panel on Mindfulness in the Workplace|last =|first =|date = April 14, 2015|website = New York University|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked as a business lawyer at [[Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle]] and then as in-house counsel for [[Panasonic]] and [[Nabisco]].&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt;

==General Mills==

Marturano joined [[General Mills]] in 1996, and became Deputy General Counsel and Vice President, Public Responsibility.&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt; She had a leading role in the complex eighteen-month business deal that occurred when General Mills acquired the [[Pillsbury Company]] in 2001; the timing of which coincided with the death of both her parents.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|last = MacVean|first = Mary|date = February 16, 2015|title = Meditation Booms As People Seek a Way to Slow Down|url = http://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-c1-meditation-20150216-story.html|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Looking for a way to regain her strength and health, she enrolled in a mindfulness workshop taught by [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]], the MIT PhD who created the [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR)]] framework.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news |last = Gelles|first = David|date = August 24, 2012|title = The mind business|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d9cb7940-ebea-11e1-985a-00144feab49a.html|newspaper = FT Magazine|publisher = The Financial Times|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a goal of sharing her own experience, Marturano developed Mindful Leadership training for her colleagues at General Mills.&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt; While still a corporate officer at General Mills, she received her mindfulness teacher certification from the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School|University of Massachusetts Medical School's]] Center for Mindfulness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hughlett |first=Mike |date=November 24, 2013 |title=MIndfulness Arrives in the Workplace |url=http://www.startribune.com/mindfulness-arrives-in-the-twin-cities-workplace/233176121/ |newspaper=Star Tribune |location=Minneapolis |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to co-develop the first mindful leadership curricula at the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School|University of Massachusetts Medical School's]] Center for Mindfulness where she later served as a member of the Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.umassmed.edu/uploadedFiles/cfm2/AnnualReport_CFM_UMass_08-4.pdf|title=Center for Mindfulness Annual Report 2008|website=University of Massachusetts Medical School}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, this Mindful Leadership training was opened to leaders from other organizations.

==Mindful Leadership==

In order to teach Mindful Leadership full-time, Marturano left General Mills in 2010 and founded the [http://www.instituteformindfulleadership.org Institute for Mindful Leadership]. Combining mindfulness with her experience as a former officer of a Fortune 200 company, she developed curricula to bring training in mindful leadership to leaders from corporate, non-profit, academic, government, and military organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/05/50-over-50_n_5648506.html|title = 50 Over 50: Career Reinvention|last =|first =|date = August 5, 2014|website = Huff Post/ Post 50|publisher = Huffington Post|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; She heads a team of instructors experienced in mindfulness training and with a variety of organizational leadership backgrounds; they collaborate to tailor curricula to suit individual clients, as well as offering programs to the general public.

In 2013, she was invited to the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, Switzerland&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; to share her understanding of the importance of mindful leadership. She spoke again at the 2014 World Economic Forum Conference in Tianjin, China and has been a featured speaker at the Wisdom 2.0 Business Conference in NY, Global Mindful Leadership Conference in Australia, and Mindful Leadership Forum in Washington, DC.

Marturano's writings and work have been featured on BBC News,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Beckett|first = Tanya|date = January 29, 2013|title = Can 'mindful' meditation increase profits?|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/business-21244171|work = BBC News|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''The New York Times'',&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last = Tugend|first = Alina|date = March 22, 2013|title = In Mindfulness, a Method to Sharpen Focus and Open Minds|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/your-money/mindfulness-requires-practice-and-purpose.html?emc=eta1&amp;_r=1&amp;|newspaper = The New York Times|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Financial Times'',&lt;ref name="FT" /&gt; ''Time'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last = Pickert|first = Kate|date = January 23, 2013|title = The Mindful Revolution|url = http://time.com/1556/the-mindful-revolution/|magazine = Time|access-date =|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;

In March 2016, [[Arianna Huffington]] selected Janice Marturano as a Huffington Post Pioneer, a HuffPost Originals video series that profiles leaders in various industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/janice-marturano-mindful-leadership_us_56e81b1ae4b0b25c91833a84|title=The 'Perfect Storm' That Turned Janice Marturano Into A Mindful Leader|last=Gregoire|first=Carolyn|date=March 17, 2016|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=Arianna Huffington |type=Editorial |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4034">'''Joseph Ogbonnaya Irukwu''' is a Nigerian insurance executive, lawyer, lecturer and author who has written published works about the insurance industry in Africa. He is also a former president of [[Ohanaeze Ndigbo|Ohaneze Ndigbo]], an ethno-political and social group that represents the interest of [[Igbo people|Igbos]] in the Nigerian polity.

Irukwu was the founding managing director of Nigerian Reinsurance Corporation, in 1989, he founded African Development Insurance Company which was later sold to [[Diamond Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201410150238.html|title=Irukwu - Insurance Penetration to Increase By 25 Percent in 2039|last=Duru|first=Nnamdi|date=October 15, 2014|work=Thisday|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Irukwu obtained his degree in Law and Insurance from a British university in 1962. Upon returning to [[Nigeria]], he found employment with West African Provincial Insurance Company, a British firm operating out of [[Lagos|Lagos.]] Originally, a legal adviser, he rose within the firm and joined the managerial cadre of the firm's insurance department in 1965.&lt;ref name="vbp"&gt;{{Cite magazine|date=1982|title=A Look at the Reinsurance Business|url=https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=7485&amp;recCount=25&amp;recPointer=0&amp;bibId=11284271|magazine=Nigerian Enterprise|language=en|location=Lagos|publisher=VBO International|volume=2|issue=7|pages=27-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, he was appointed chief executive officer of Unity Life and Fire Insurance Company and it was while working at Unity that his profile began to rise. In 1972, the government appointed him head of the student loans board, a committee with the responsibility to disburse loans to thousands of students.&lt;ref name="vbp" /&gt; In 1977, Irukwu became the pioneer chief executive of Nigerian Reinsurance Corporation, a government owned business established to increase the local share of [[reinsurance]] premium income. Prior to the establishment of the firm, insurance firms in Nigeria, conducted reinsurance transactions with foreign companies. To boost the local insurance market and reduce foreign exchange out-flow, the government founded Nigerian Re. The new firm was given the right of first refusal for any reinsurance transaction to be conducted in Nigeria. One of Irukwu's main challenges was to recruit and train talent in a line of business that was new to Nigeria. The firm engaged foreign institutions in the training of workers and sponsored a training school in Lagos.&lt;ref name="vbp" /&gt; 

=== Academic career ===
In the early 1970s, Irukwu began to conduct lectures in actuarial science at University of Lagos. In addition, he was involved in developing training programs at the West African Insurance Companies Association (WAICA) and at the [[West African Insurance Institute]].&lt;ref name="vbp" /&gt;

He published his first book, ''Insurance Law and Practice in Nigeria'' in 1967 and his second book, ''Accident and Motor Insurance in West Africa'' was published in 1974. His third book, ''Insurance Management in Africa'' was published in 1976.&lt;ref name="vbp" /&gt;

'''Lee Seng Wee''', {{post-nominals|list=[[Darjah Utama Bakti Cemerlang|DUBC]]}} ({{zh|s=李成伟|t=李成偉|p=Lǐ Chéngwěi|poj=Lí Sîng-uí}}; April 4, 1930{{spaced ndash}}August 7, 2015) was a [[Singapore]]an banker and businessman.

== Early life ==
Lee was the third son of rubber tycoon [[Lee Kong Chian]], and grandson of Singaporean pioneer [[Tan Kah Kee]]. He was educated at the [[Anglo-Chinese School]] in Singapore&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blueskiescom.com/alumni/oct_nov_15/memoriam.html|title=In Memoriam - Mr Lee Seng Wee|website=www.blueskiescom.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently studied engineering at the [[University of Toronto]]. He graduated first in his MBA class from the University of Western Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume I &amp; II|last=Suryadinata|first=Leo|date=2012|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=9789814345217|location=|pages=541|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Lee joined the Lee Rubber Company after returning to Singapore and rose to the position of vice-chairman. He then became a director of Southeast Asia's second-largest bank, [[Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation]] (OCBC) from 1966 until 2016, and Chairman from 1995 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/former-ocbc-bank-chairman-lee-seng-wee-dies-aged-85-8233784|title=Former OCBC Bank chairman Lee Seng Wee dies aged 85|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He orchestrated a S$2.4 billion takeover bid for Singapore's then-fifth largest bank, Keppel Capital Holdings in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/lee-seng-wee/|title=Lee Seng Wee|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Lee stepped down as chairman and moved to a non-executive position, but continued to guide the strategic direction of the bank. Major investments and acquisitions during his long tenure include OCBC-NISP in Indonesia, OCBC China Bank, OCBC-Wing Hang in Hong Kong; the private banking business of ING Asia Bank, majority control of Great Eastern Life Insurance and a 20 percent stake in Bank of Ningbo in China. The net profit after tax for OCBC Group was almost S$4 billion for 2015.

In addition to his role in OCBC, Lee was also a director of several companies, including Lee Rubber Group Companies and [[Lee Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/former-ocbc-chairman-lee-seng-wee-dies-aged-85|title=Former OCBC chairman Lee Seng Wee dies, aged 85|last=U-Wen|first=Lee|work=The Business Times|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a board member of the [[Government of Singapore Investment Corporation]] and on the Council of Presidential Advisors, Singapore. He was conferred the Distinguished Service Order in 2001. In 2006, he received the Woodrow Wilson Award in New York for Singapore.

== Death ==
On August 7, 2015, at the age of 85, Lee died of complications arising from a head injury sustained during a fall at home. Lee leaves behind a wife and three children and six grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/former-ocbc-chairman-lee-seng-wee-dies-aged-85|title=Former OCBC chairman Lee Seng Wee dies aged 85, Banking News &amp; Top Stories - The Straits Times|date=2015-08-10|access-date=2017-08-29|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810173634/http://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/former-ocbc-chairman-lee-seng-wee-dies-aged-85|archivedate=2015-08-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2297">{{About|information and analysis of a commercial market|information to support marketing activities|Marketing intelligence}}

'''Market intelligence''' is the information relevant to a company’s markets, gathered and analyzed specifically for the purpose of accurate and confident [[decision-making]] in determining strategy in areas such as [[market opportunity]], [[market penetration]] strategy, and [[market development]].&lt;ref name="Cornish"&gt;Cornish, S. L. “Product Innovation and the Spatial Dynamics of Market Intelligence: Does Proximity to Markets Matter?” Economic Geography. Volume: 73, Issue 2 (April 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Market intelligence includes the process of gathering data from the company’s external environment, whereas the [[Business intelligence]] process primarily is based on internal recorded events – such as sales, shipments and purchases. The purpose of incorporating Market Information or intelligence into the Business Intelligence process is to provide decision makers with a more “complete picture” of ongoing corporate performance in a set of given market conditions.&lt;ref name="Prescott"&gt;Prescott, John and others, Proven Strategies in Competitive Intelligence (Wiley, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gathering market intelligence data ==
Effective market intelligence needs accurate market information that is gathered with right tools and methods. To gather information companies can conduct [[survey (human research)|survey]]s, [[interview]]s, visit and monitor competitors outlets or gather and buy data from different sources.

Traditional interviews and surveys can be done either in-house or by using specialists agencies. As more and more markets are digitalized the market intelligence space has seen a lot of new digital tools that companies can use. There are tools such as [https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/home Google Consumer Survey] that enables companies to ask web users a question through Google network of online publishers. There are also specialist sites companies can buy market intelligence information and market intelligence software that companies can use to collect and monitor data from the internet.

The '''mass-market theory''', otherwise known as the '''trickle across''', is a social [[fashion]] behavioral [[marketing strategy]] established by Robinson in 1958 and King in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Egreen. (Apr 19th 2011). ''Basic Fashion Theory and Impact of Media''. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://egreen.umwblogs.org/literature-review/&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Last accessed 2nd Nov 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mass market]] is defined as, "a market coverage strategy in which a firm decides to ignore [[market segment]] differences and appeal to the whole market with one offer or one strategy."&lt;ref&gt;"Mass Marketing". 2012. Retrieved 2 May 2012. “Business Dictionary”&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism focuses on the fashion innovators found within every [[socio-economic group|social economic group]] and the influences in response to the couture enthusiasts that innovate as part of their stylish aspect.

In contrast to the [[trickle-down effect]] of [[fashion trend|fashion innovation]], this theory states that fashion trickles across different social groups as opposed to upper to lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of clothing and fashion. (May 25th, 2010). ''Theories of fashion.'' Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://angelasancartier.net/theories-of-fashion&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Last accessed 2nd Nov 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion innovation is not just confined to the upper class but can actually come from the innovators amongst the different socioeconomic groups.&lt;ref&gt;''Retailing Management''. 7 ed. Michael Levy and Barton A. Weitz. (2009). publisher: McGraw-Hill Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, known as the '''trickle across theory.'''&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Greene Marshall, Mary Kefgen, Hazelle Jackson, and M. Sue Stanley (2000). ''Individuality in clothing selection and personal appearance'' (5 ed.). Prentice Hall. p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory's roots from new fashion adoption influences 'simultaneously by different social economic group and are contained within the different groups'.&lt;ref name="Affluence"&gt;Juliet Ash, Elizabeth Wilson. (1993a). "Popular Fashion And Working Class Affluence", ''Chic Thrills: A Fashion Reader''. Berkley and Los Angeles, California: Pandora Press. 145-153.&lt;/ref&gt;

The key dynamics of this theory are as follows:
*Adoption of new trends by all [[socioeconomic]] groups simultaneously
*[[Consumer]]s preference from a large scale of existing trends
*Within each socioeconomic group there are fashion innovators that meet their preferred fashion demands
*The flow of fashion information and individual influence in the fashion world 'trickles across' each social economic group
*'Vertical flow' remains evident, it is primarily in the [[fashion industry]] e.g. fashion editors &lt;ref&gt;Leslie Davis Burns. (1999). ''Section 6a. Mass Market Theory.'' Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/aihm577/intro6a.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Last accessed 2nd Nov 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The stages of mass market theory==
George B. Sproles created 'the fashion mechanism, as a five-stage process propagated largely by social motivations' in the Mass Market Theory:

*''1. 'Adoption Leadership by "Consumer Fashion Change Agents'''

This stage is the introduction of the fashion innovation; these innovators are known for being 'leaders of collective taste' through social networking, invest in their interest of adopting new fashion as part of their stylish aspect.

*''2. 'The Social Visibility and Communicability Phase'''

In this stage the fashion goes through a "use cycle," the latest fashion is categorized as "new" and "novel," and will then develop to become highly detectable in the fashion industry portraying it as the 'latest fashion', disregarding present styles and trends.

*''3. 'Conformity Within and Across Social Systems'''

In this stage the 'latest fashion' will achieve a foundation through social networking to social acceptance by communication across social systems. Due to this 'diffusion process social contagion and social conformity then set new fashion tastes'.

*''4. 'Market and Social Saturation'''

If the latest fashion has made it to this stage, it will have attained its capital level of acceptance, therefore creating a form of "social saturation", therefore fashion is consistently utilized amongst the vast majority of individuals.

*''5. 'Decline and Obsolescence Forced By the Emergence of New Fashion Alternatives'''

The latest fashion will eventually come to a decline in the industry, removing it from being portrayed as 'new' and 'novel' due to the emerging trend or style that has been newly introduced as part of the "use" cycle. The fashion then experiences minimal usage and limited social acceptance eventually becoming obsolete.

The fundamental aspect is that the fashion industry is being majorly influenced by 'social communications and social influence'.&lt;ref&gt;George B. Sproles. (1974). ''Fashion Theory: A Conceptual Framework''. Available: https://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=5731. Last accessed 2nd Nov 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social economic groups fashion preferences==
Juliet Ash, [[Elizabeth Wilson]] describes the difference in fashion preference as consumer choice widen and fashion becomes 'an integral part of identity formation'. More privileged societies tend to wear the same "classic" styles and disregard the latest fashions as they oppose an apparent "distinction of occupational achievement". The upper-middle classes desire clothing more "corresponding to wealth and high living". For the lower-middle classes tend to disregard "high style", for what is "daring" or "unusual". Individuals who are on a spending budget are more likely to purchase the 'latest trend' but frequently make their customised adaptions.&lt;ref name="Affluence"/&gt;

Ultimately fashion opinion leaders influence the adoption and diffusion of fashions within a social group. When individuals play both roles of opinion, leader and innovator, they are referred to as "innovative communicators" within each social economic group.

==Implications of mass-market theory==
Due to the ease of access to all the fashion segments in the industry and at all prices, the development in the textiles of garments along with the expansion in retail trade has eradicated the differentiating social economic class. This allowed more distinctions to incur in these segments, including 'make', retail 'brand', fabric, as well as style and quality.

Market trends derive in many social groups, including youthful urban subcultures.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Crane. (November 1999). ''Diffusion Models and Fashion: A Reassessment.'' Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ann.sagepub.com/content/566/1/13.refs&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Last accessed 2 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain trends to the fashion industry may appear to be more popular and successful within some social economic groups as opposed to other groups. Other fashion trends may even fail to all types of social economic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Marketing Theory: A Student Text. (31 March 2010). Summary and future outlook. In: Michael J Baker, Michael John Baker, Michael Saren ''Marketing Theory: A Student Text''. 2nd ed. UK: SAGE. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; "The newest styles become adopted in different ways. This can be through the process of customization in which certain elements become more important than others and is solely dictated by the consumer."&lt;ref name="Affluence"/&gt; In today's fashion industry it has become increasingly challenging for fashion firms achieve consumer satisfaction due to the constant and rapid development of trends and styles.&lt;ref&gt;Jagdish C.

[[File:OliveOilExtractionProcess.png|thumb|Modern method of olive oil extraction]]

'''Olive oil extraction''' is the process of extracting the oil present in olive [[drupe]]s, known as [[olive oil]]. Olive oil is produced in the [[mesocarp]] [[plant cell|cells]], and stored in a particular type of [[vacuole]] called a lipo vacuole, i.e.,&amp;nbsp;every cell contains a tiny olive oil droplet. Olive oil extraction is the process of separating the [[oil]] from the other fruit contents (vegetative extract liquid and solid material). It is possible to attain this separation by physical means alone, i.e.,&amp;nbsp;oil and water do not mix, so they are relatively easy to separate. This contrasts with other [[Vegetable oil| oils]] that are extracted with chemical [[solvents]], generally [[hexane]].&lt;ref&gt;F. D. Gunstone, ''Vegetable Oils in Food Technology: Composition, Properties, and Uses'', 2002, CRC Press, 351 pages {{ISBN|0-8493-2816-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first operation when extracting olive oil is washing the olives, to reduce the presence of [[contaminant]]s, especially [[soil contamination|soil]] which can create a particular [[flavor]] effect called "soil taste".

== Olive presses ==
[[File:Press. Katzrin ancient village 04.jpg|thumb|Oil press in the [[Israeli settlement]] [[Katzrin]]]]
[[Image:OliveOilFactoryMorocco.jpg|thumb|Grinder with two millstones and in the foreground several fiber disks]]
[[Image:Olive paste being applied to fiber map.JPG|thumb|Olive paste after stone crushing is being applied to fiber mats in Sicily]]
[[Image:Marokko-162.JPG|thumb|Press with stack of fiber disks]]

People have used olive presses since Greeks first began pressing olives over 5,000 years ago.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} Roman olive presses survive to the present time, with a notable collection present at [[Volubilis]] in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906 C. Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', The Megaoithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; An olive press works by applying pressure to olive paste to separate the liquid oil and vegetation water from the solid material. The oil and vegetation water are then separated by standard [[decantation]].

This basic method is still widely used today, and it is still a valid way of producing high quality olive oil if adequate precautions are taken.

First the olives are ground into an olive paste using large [[millstone]]s at an [[oil mill]]. The olive paste generally stays under the stones for 30‑40&amp;nbsp;minutes. This has three objectives:
* Ensure that olives are well ground
* Allow enough time for the olive drops to join to form the largest droplets of oil
* Allow the fruit [[enzymes]] to produce some of the oil aromas and taste

Olive oil mills very rarely use a modern crushing method with a traditional press.

After grinding, the olive paste is spread on fiber disks, which are stacked on top of each other, then placed into the press. Traditionally the disks were made of hemp or coconut fiber, but in modern times they are made of synthetic fibers which are easier to clean and maintain.

These disks are then put on a hydraulic piston, forming a pile. Pressure is applied on the disks, thus compacting the solid phase of the olive paste and percolating the liquid phases (oil and vegetation water). The applied hydraulic pressure can go to 400&amp;nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]. To facilitate separation of the liquid phases, water is run down the sides of the disks to increase the speed of percolation. The liquids are then separated either by a standard process of decantation or by means of a faster vertical [[centrifuge]].

The traditional method is a valid form of producing high-quality olive oil, if after each extraction the disks are properly cleaned from the remains of paste; if not the leftover paste will begin to ferment, thereby producing inconsistencies of flavors (called defects) that will contaminate the subsequently produced olive oil. A similar problem can affect the grindstones that, in order to assure perfect quality, also require cleaning after each usage.

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
Proper cleaning produces higher-quality oil. Grindstones, while ancient in design, are a suitable way to grind olives, because this method breaks up the [[drupe]]'s pulp while only slightly touching the nut and the skin. This reduces the release of the oil [[Rancidification|oxidation]] enzymes present in these organs. In addition, in this extraction method, the introduction of water is minimal when compared to the modern one, thus reducing the washing-off of the [[polyphenol]]s. The exhausted paste, called [[pomace]], has a low content of water, making it an easier residue to manage.

'''Advantages'''
* Better grinding of the olives, reducing the release of oil [[Rancidification|oxidation]] enzymes
* Reduced added water, minimizing the washing of polyphenols
* Pomace with a low content of water easier to manage

'''Disadvantages'''
* Difficult to clean
* Non-continuous process with waiting periods thus exposes the olive paste to [[oxygen]] and light
* Requires more manual labor
* Longer production time from harvest to pressing

== Decanter centrifugation ==
The modern method of olive oil extraction uses an industrial decanter to separate all the phases by [[centrifugation]]. In this method the olives are crushed to a fine paste. This can be done by a hammer crusher, disc crusher, depitting machine or knife crusher. This paste is then [[malaxation|malaxed]] for 30 to 60 minutes in order to allow the small olive droplets to agglomerate. The aromas are created in these two steps through the action of fruit [[enzyme]]s.

Afterwards the paste is pumped into an industrial decanter where the phases will be separated. Water is added to facilitate the extraction process with the paste.

The decanter is a large capacity horizontal [[centrifuge]] rotating approximately 3,000&amp;nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]], the high [[centrifugal force]] created allows the phases to be readily separated according to their different densities (solids &gt; vegetation water &gt; oil). Inside the decanter's rotating conical drum there is a coil that rotates more slowly, pushing the solid materials out of the system.

[[Image:Decanter.gif|center|500px|thumb|Diagram of a working decanter. The three phases are separated according to their densities.]]

The separated oil and vegetation water are then rerun through a vertical centrifuge, working around 6,000&amp;nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]] that will separate the small quantity of vegetation water still contained in oil and vice versa.

=== Three, two, and two and a half phases decanters ===
With the '''three phases''' oil decanter, a portion of the oil polyphenols is washed out due to the higher quantity of added water (when compared to the traditional method), producing a larger quantity of vegetation water that needs to be processed.

The '''two phases''' oil decanter was created as an attempt to solve these problems. Sacrificing part of its extraction capability, it uses less added water thus reducing the phenol washing. The olive paste is separated into two phases: oil and wet pomace. This type of decanter, instead of having three exits (oil, water, and solids), has only two. The water is expelled by the decanter coil together with the pomace, resulting in a wetter pomace that is much harder to process industrially. Many pomace oil extraction facilities refuse to work with these materials because the energy costs of drying the pomace for the hexane oil extraction often make the extraction process sub-economical. In practice, then, the two phases decanter solves the phenol washing problem but increases the residue management problem. This residue management problem has been reduced by the collection of this wetter pomace and being transported to specialized facilities called extractors which heat the pomace between 45ºc and 50ºc and can extract up to a further 2&amp;nbsp;litres per 100&amp;nbsp;kilos of pomace using adapted two-phase decanters.

The two-and-a-half-phase oil decanter is a compromise between the two previous types of decanters. It separates the olive paste into the standard three phases, but has a smaller need for added water and also a smaller vegetation water output. Therefore, the water content of the obtained pomace comes very close to that of the standard three-phase decanter, and the vegetation water output is relatively small, minimizing the residue management issues.

Depending on the olives and processing, the [[Decanter]] or Tricanter can extract between 85 and 90% of the olive oil in the 1st extraction. The yield from olive oil manufacture can be increased even further with a 2nd extraction. The olive oil yield increases to as much as 96% by combining the 1st and 2nd extractions. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flottweg.com/applications/edible-fats-and-oils-biofuels/olive-oil/ Higher Yield due to the 2nd Extraction in Olive Oil Manufacture]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
'''Advantages'''
* Compact machinery: only one decanter required
* Continuous and automated
* Limited labor required
* Highest percent of oil extraction
* Vegetable water disposal less of a problem
* Olive oil from two-phase centrifugation systems contains more phenols, [[tocopherol]]s, trans‑2‑hexenal, and total aroma compounds and is more resistant to oxidation than oil from three-phase ones and from hydraulic presses

'''Disadvantages'''
* Expensive
* More technical labor required
* High energy consumption
* Pomace may end up moist
* Greater amount of vegetable water to be disposed of
* Reduced antioxidants due to added water
* Subject to wear from rocks, grit

== Sinolea method ==
The Sinolea method to extract oil from the olives was introduced in 1972;&lt;ref&gt;Dimitrios Boskou, ''Olive Oil: Chemistry and Technology'', Contributor American Oil Chemists Society, 2006, AOCS Press, 268 pages {{ISBN|1-893997-88-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this process, rows of metal discs or plates are dipped into the paste; the oil preferentially wets and sticks to the metal and is removed with scrapers in a continuous process. It is based on the different [[surface tension]] of the vegetation water and the oil, these different physical behaviors allow the olive oil to adhere to a steel plaque while the other two phases remain behind.

Sinolea works by continuously introducing several hundreds of steel plaques into the paste thus extracting the olive oil. This process is not completely efficient leaving a large quantity of oil still in the paste, so the remaining paste has to be processed by the standard modern method (industrial decanter).

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
'''Advantages'''
* Higher polyphenol content of oil
* Low temperature method
* Automated
* Low labor
* Oil/water separation step is not needed
* Low energy requirement

'''Disadvantages'''
* Often must be combined with one of the above methods in order to maximize oil extraction which requires more space and labor
* Large surface areas can lead to rapid [[oxidation]] of the olive product
* Sale of future machines currently outlawed in the [[European Union]] due to difficulty in cleaning large surface areas

== First cold pressed – cold extraction ==
Many oils are marketed as first cold pressed or cold extraction. "Cold" means no heat is added during extraction. "Pressed" means that the olives are crushed in a mill to extract the oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olive Oil Origin &amp; Production|url=http://aboutoliveoil.org/olive_oil_world/origin.html|website=About Olive Oil|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the EU, these designations are regulated by Article&amp;nbsp;5 of [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002R1019:EN:NOT Commission Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002 of 13 June 2002 on marketing standards for olive oil]. This article states that in order to use these designations the olive oil bottler must prove that the temperature of [[malaxation]] and extraction was under 27&amp;nbsp;°C (80&amp;nbsp;°F).

For olive oil bottled outside EU&amp;nbsp;countries, this regulation does not apply, and thus the consumer has no assurance that these statements are true.

The temperature of malaxation and extraction is crucial due to its effect on olive oil quality. When high temperatures are applied, the more volatile aromas are lost and the rate of oil oxidation is increased, producing therefore lower quality oils. In addition, the chemical content of the polyphenols, [[polyphenol antioxidant|antioxidants]], and [[vitamin]]s present in the oil is reduced by higher temperatures. The temperature is adjusted basically by controlling the temperature of the water added during these two steps. High temperatures are used to increase the yield of olive oil obtained from the paste.

== Alternative configurations ==
Some producers, in order to maximise product quality, choose to combine the traditional grinding method, the stone mill, with a modern [[decanter]]. This technique produces more selective grinding of the olives, reduces the malaxation time olive paste, and avoids the complicated cleaning of the olive press fibre disks. Because the use of the stone mill requires a loading and unloading phase, this extraction method is discontinuous, i.e., there are times when all the machinery is stopped, therefore it is generally not used on a large commercial scale, being applied only by small scale olive mills producing high quality olive oil.

== Consumer point of view ==
High quality olive oil can be obtained by all the methods if proper measures are taken. Olive oil quality is equally dependent on the quality of the olives themselves and on the time they have to wait from harvesting to extraction, in addition to the extraction method itself.

The two main agents that cause the degradation of olive oil are oxygen and light. Once an olive is harvested, it should be pressed within 24 hours. Oxidation begins immediately upon harvesting. In the period between harvest and grinding, the fruits' enzymes are very active and increasingly degrade the [[endogenous]] oil, and therefore oil obtained after a longer wait is of lower quality, presenting higher [[Olive oil acidity|acidity]] ([[free fatty acids]] percentage).

In addition, if additional oxygen is allowed to interact with the olive paste during the extraction process, the acidity level will increase further. Sealed extraction methods are best to prevent the continued introduction of oxygen, as well as light to the oil.

After extraction is complete, in most cases [[unfiltered olive oil]] appears somewhat cloudy, mainly due to the presence of minute amounts of water and suspended solids of olive pulp and seed. This type of oil is therefore sometimes called ''cloudy'' or ''veiled olive oil''.

It is common practice that unfiltered olive oils are then "racked" for a time, i.e. stored in cool [[stainless steel]] silos with a conical bottom that are pumped free of oxygen to enable the precipitation and separation of the two phases and facilitate later [[filtration]]; it will also contribute in the integrity and stability of the oil.

== Future prospects ==
The future of olive extraction points to reducing the negative aspects of the present methods, decreasing the degradation oil produced by the extraction process in itself.
* Reducing the oxidation by performing part of the process of malaxation and the extraction under a controlled [[nitrogen]] atmosphere
* Extracting the nut of the olive before grinding, this will reduce the release of [[oxidative enzyme]]s present in this organ, and yield a [[pomace]] that is free from wood residues, making it possible to be used in animal feeding
* Reducing the addition of water to minimize the washing of polyphenols
* Improving the sinolea method, through an increase in the efficiency of the [[adsorption]] of the oil to the plates, thus reducing the need for the use of standard methods of extraction

{{nihongo|'''Tadahiro Sekimoto'''|関本忠弘|Sekimoto Tadahiro|extra=November 14, 1926 – November 11, 2007}} was a Japanese electronics engineer, a recipient of the [[IEEE Medal of Honor]] (2004), chairman of Japan's Institute for International Socio-Economic Studies (IISE), and former chairman of the Board of Councilors of the [[Japan Federation of Economic Organizations]] (Keidanren) who served as president and later chairman of Japan's [[NEC Corporation]] (NEC). Born in [[Hyōgo Prefecture|Hyōgo]], [[Japan]], Sekimoto earned his [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in physics in 1948 and his [[Doctor of Engineering]] degree in 1962 at the [[University of Tokyo]].

On 11 November 2007, he died after a series of [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nec.co.jp/press/en/0711/1201.html |title=Tadahiro Sekimoto, Former Chairman of NEC,Passed Away on November 11, 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-12 |publisher=NEC Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate career==
Sekimoto joined NEC, now a globally active Japanese information technologies conglomerate and member of the [[Sumitomo Group]], in 1948. He started his career at the company's Central Research Laboratories, where he advanced to chief of basic research in 1965. In August 1965 he was appointed to a two-year assignment at [[COMSAT]] in [[Washington, DC]], where he engaged in research on digital transmission technologies used in satellite communications. On his return to NEC in 1967, Sekimoto was appointed to manage the company's Communications Research Laboratory. He rose to general manager of NEC's Transmission Division in 1972 and, in 1974, was elected to the NEC board of directors. He was appointed senior vice president in 1977 and executive vice president with portfolio for sales in Japan in 1978. In this position, he enhanced the company's sales operations in the Japanese domestic market by creating structures conducive to marketing mass-produced electronics products. In 1980, Sekimoto was appointed president of NEC and launched NEC's C&amp;C concept for integrating computers and communications, which resulted in significant sales increases. Finally, Sekimoto served as chairman of the board from 1994 to 1998, when he resigned from the post (as well as from his chairmanship of the Keidanren Board of Councilors) to apologize for NEC's role in a scandal involving the [[Japan Defense Agency]], Japan's de facto defence ministry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nec.co.jp/press/en/9810/2302.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to communications technologies==
Sekimoto, in addition the accomplishments of his corporate career, made significant contributions to the advancement of communications technologies over more than 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/about/awards/bios/2004moh.html&lt;/ref&gt; During his 17 years at NEC's Central Research Laboratories he designed early pulse-code modulation equipment down to the coding and decoding circuitry. During his two years at COMSAT, he set up a communications processing laboratory and oversaw or helped oversee numerous projects covering voice-, data-, and video-processing technologies, including the development of single-channel-per-carrier pulse-code-modulation multiple-access demand-assignment equipment and assigned it the acronym SPADE because "the ace of the spades in card games was regarded as almighty".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i-ise.com/en/column/column_top.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the early 1970s, Intelsat commercialized SPADE technology, which is credited with allowing developing countries to join global networks by making satellite communications affordable to them. A time-division multiple access (TDMA) system and an automatic routing system Sekimoto developed were not only hugely significant for satellite communications, but also became indispensable elements of cellular mobile communications thirty years on. Seminal in their day, many technologies and applications Sekimoto worked on at NEC and COMSAT are integral to modern telecommunications systems, and they helped lay the groundwork for the global networks that many societies now depend on.

Sekimoto has also authored numerous works, both technical publications and books written for a wider audience, and he has 35 Japanese and five non-Japanese patents to his credit.

==Recognition for accomplishments==
Sekimoto, an IEEE Life Fellow and a foreign associate of the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in the U.S., has been recognized for his contributions to communications with numerous awards. In addition to its Medal of Honor, the IEEE also awarded him its [[IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal|Alexander Graham Bell Medal]], and he is a recipient of the IEEE Communication Society’s Edwin Howard Armstrong Award. He has also received the American Institute of Astronautics and Aeronautics’ Aerospace Communications Award. He was appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour of France in 1995 and an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1996. The Japanese government honoured him with a Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon in 1982 and the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]] in 1997; he was posthumously granted the third degree of precedence in official rank in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Japanese Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

When speaking, Sekimoto invariably credits his mentor, Koji Kobayashi—also an engineer who served as president and then chairman of NEC, for inspiring him to pursue his interests. Sekimoto was lately active in promoting research on relations between Japan and other countries and ways to solve Japan's own social problems through his role at the IISE.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4773">'''Trade in services statistics''' are economic [[statistics]] which detail international [[trade in services]]. They  received a great deal of focus at the advent of services negotiations which took place under the Uruguay Round, which became part of the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]], one of the four principal pillars of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) trade treaty, also called the "WTO Agreement".

The [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS) Four Modes of Supply comprises:
* '''Mode 1''' Cross border trade, which is defined as delivery of a service from the territory of one country into the territory of other country;
* '''Mode 2'''  Consumption abroad - this mode covers supply of a service of one country to the service consumer of any other country;
* '''Mode 3'''  Commercial presence - which covers services provided by a service supplier of one country in the territory of any other country, i.e., foreign direct investment undertaken by a service provider;
* '''Mode 4'''  Presence of natural persons - which covers services provided by a service supplier of one country through the presence of natural persons in the territory another economy.

Statistics which correspondent to the GATS [[Four Modes of Supply]] comprise quantitative data addressing:
* '''[[Trade in services]]''', which is defined as delivery of a service from the territory of one country into the territory of other country, specific disaggregation as per GATS Four Modes of Supply may not apply, i.e., this depends on decisions taken by each country;
* '''[[Foreign direct investment]] (FDI)'''  Cross-border foreign investment as per [[International Monetary Fund]] guidelines.  ''Roughly correspondent to Mode 3''
* '''[[Foreign Affiliate Trade Statistics]] (FATS)'''  Statistics, or corporate data detailing the operations of [[foreign direct investment]]-based enterprises, including sales, expenditures, profits, value-added, inter- and intra-firm trade, exports and imports; ''Roughly correspondent to Mode 3''

Statistics which detail commercial [[trade in services|services trade]] taking place under the GATS are in a state of development in most countries.  Most countries don't have information which details trade as per the GATS Four Modes of Supply, which makes trade negotiations in this realm difficult, especially for developing country WTO members.  The United States Bureau of Economic analysis produces rich statistics in this area, but they do not address the GATS Four Modes of Supply directly, rather, they address only cross-border services, generally defined, and statistics related to FDI.  FATS, are collected by the United States BEA, and several other OECD countries.

'''Unemployment extension''' occurs when regular [[unemployment benefits]] are exhausted and extended for additional weeks. Unemployment extensions are created by passing new [[legislation]] at the federal level, often referred to as an "unemployment extension bill."  This new legislation is introduced and passed during times of high or above average [[unemployment]] rates. Unemployment extensions are set during a date range in order to estimate their [[federal cost]].  After expiration, the unemployment data is re-evaluated, and new legislation may be proposed and passed to further extend them.

==Unemployment Extensions in The United States==
In the [[United States]], there is a standard of 26 weeks of unemployment benefits, known as "regular [[unemployment insurance]] (UI) benefits."  There are two programs for extending unemployment insurance (UI) benefits:&lt;ref name="ui1"&gt;[http://www.twc.state.tx.us/ui/bnfts/benefitextensions.pdf Texas Workforce Commission], Understanding Extended Unemployment Benefits PDF&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emergency Unemployment Compensation]] (EUC) and Extended Benefits (EB).

The unemployment insurance program is a great benefit for workers whom have lost their job. The maximum duration of benefits has increased from 26 to 99 weeks in some states. Unemployment extensions across the United States are a concern due to the lack of motivation in obtaining a job due to health issues. A solution to the problem would be to implement frequent processes to ensure the individual continues to stay actively applying as well as proper health routines are done. The benefits given are too long causing a lack in motivation to find a job and health issues that arise as a result of being laid off. Health issues include: anxiety, depression, joint problems, and low self-esteem. A solution to the problem would be to require routine health checkups to individuals receiving the unemployment benefits. Another solution would be to provide seminars that help motivate individuals and keep them prepared when actively applying for jobs to avoid the benefits extension that would lead to underlying health issues. Providing unemployed individuals with the proper tools and resources will help with the unemployment rate and the need for extending unemployment benefits in the United States.

EUC is a 100% federally funded program that provides benefits to individuals who have exhausted regular state benefits. The EUC program was created on June 30, 2008, and has been modified several times. Most recently, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-240) extended the expiration date of the EUC program to January 1, 2014. To date, Congress has not passed any further extensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/supp_act.asp|title=Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) Expired on January 1, 2014, Employment &amp; Training Administration (ETA) - U.S. Department of Labor|website=www.workforcesecurity.doleta.gov|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC)===
{{prose|section|date=September 2010}}
''EUC has four levels: Tiers 1, 2, 3 and 4.''&lt;ref name="ui2"&gt;[http://www.esd.wa.gov/uibenefits/fileweekly/extension/emergency-unemployment-compensation.php Washington State Employment Dept.], Emergency Unemployment Compensation FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;

EUC08, or Emergency Unemployment Compensation 2008, is an extension of unemployment benefits authorized under Federal law.  The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (enacted on Feb 22, 2012) modified EUC08.&lt;ref name="ui5"&gt;[http://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/UIPL/uipl_4_10_change9_acc.pdf U.S. Dept. of Labor], Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 04-10, Change 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ui6"&gt;[http://www.workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/KeyDates_Table.pdf U.S. Dept. of Labor], Key Dates for UI Programs Following Enactment of Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, P.L. 112-96&lt;/ref&gt;

Claimants who filed an initial claim effective on or after May 7, 2006 are potentially eligible for EUC08. Individuals who are monetarily ineligible when a new benefit year is filed may qualify for EUC08 on the basis of a previous claim.

* EUC Tier 1
** Provides up to 20 weeks of benefits (was 13 weeks before Nov 22, 2008)
** Starting Sep 2, 2012, reduced to 14 weeks of benefits
** Eligible to claimants who exhaust regular UI benefits
** No state unemployment rate requirements – available in every state


* EUC Tier 2
** Provides up to 14 weeks of benefits (was 13 weeks before Nov 6, 2009)
** Eligible to claimants who exhaust EUC Tier 1 benefits
** No state unemployment rate requirements – available in every state (a state high unemployment trigger was required before Nov 6, 2009)
** Starting Jun 1, 2012, requires 3-month seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate (TUR) of at least 6.0%


* EUC Tier 3
** Provides up to 13 weeks of benefits 
** Starting Sep 2, 2012, reduced to 9 weeks of benefits (4 weeks moved from Tier 3 to Tier 4)
** Eligible to claimants who exhaust EUC Tier 2 benefits
** Enacted Nov 6, 2009
** Available in states with a: 3-month seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate (TUR) of at least 6.0%; or 13-week insured unemployment rate (IUR) of at least 4.0%
** Starting Jun 1, 2012, TUR requirement increased to at least 7.0%; IUR requirement not changed


* EUC Tier 4
** Provides up to 6 weeks of benefits
** Between Feb 22, 2012 and May 31, 2012 increased to 16 weeks of benefits in states not receiving Extended Benefits (EB).  Claimants may have their benefits increased in certain cases:
*** Claimants receiving Tier 4 benefits on Feb 22, 2012, in states not receiving Extended Benefits on Feb 22, 2012, will be increased to 16 weeks
*** New Tier 4 claims in this period (in states not receiving Extended Benefits the week of the new claim) are entitled to 16 weeks of benefits
*** Claimants in states that transition off Extended Benefits in this period are NOT entitled to an increase; their claim start week (compared to their state's EB status) determines whether they are entitled to 6 or 16 weeks of benefits.
** Starting Jun 1, 2012, 16 weeks of benefits reduced to 6 weeks (EB test removed)
** Starting Sep 2, 2012, increased to 10 weeks of benefits (4 weeks moved from Tier 3 to Tier 4)
** Eligible to claimants who exhaust EUC Tier 3 benefits
** Available in states with a: 3-month seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate (TUR) of at least 8.5%; or 13-week insured unemployment rate (IUR) of at least 6.0%
** Starting Jun 1, 2012, TUR requirement increased to at least 9.0%; IUR requirement not changed

===Extended Benefits (EB)===
Extended Benefits are available to workers who have exhausted regular unemployment insurance benefits during periods of high [[unemployment]]. The basic Extended Benefits program provides up to 13 additional weeks of benefits when a State is experiencing high unemployment. Some States have also enacted a voluntary program to pay up to 7 additional weeks (20 weeks maximum) of Extended Benefits during periods of extremely high unemployment.&lt;ref name="ui4"&gt;[http://ows.doleta.gov/unemploy/extenben.asp U.S. Dept. of Labor], Unemployment Insurance Extended Benefits&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reachback==
In addition to individuals who exhausted all rights to benefits after the original date of enactment, the [[#Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC)|EUC]] law includes what is commonly referred to as a [[reachback provision]]. A reachback provision makes eligible those individuals who exhausted all rights to benefits prior to the original date of enactment (back to a specified date). The EUC law makes eligible all individuals whose benefit year ending date is on or after May 1, 2007. Practically speaking, this means some individuals receiving EUC may have become unemployed as early as May 2006.&lt;ref name="ui3"&gt;[http://ows.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/euc08.pdf U.S. Dept. of Labor], Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) Program PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guinea Loan Agreement==

===Background===
In April 2011, following a period during which Palladino advised the Government of Guinea on renovating and invigorating Guinea’s mining industry, Palladino Capital agreed a US$25 million loan to finance the establishment of a state-run mining company.&lt;ref&gt;The original Loan Agreement published online in French and English. http://guinealoan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ConventionDeCreditEn.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The agreement was signed by [[Mohamed Lamine Fofana]], the Guinean mining minister and Guinea's finance minister, [[Kerfalla Yansane]] and [[Samuel Mebiane]], who was listed as a "proxy holder" for Palladino.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yumanewsnow.com/index.php/news/latest/648-backroom-deals-threaten-american-interests NAPSI, "Backroom Deals Threaten American Interests"], http://yumanewsnow.com (1 July 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms of the loan included a conversion clause which meant that if the Guinea government defaulted, they could repay the debt by conversion or 'payment in kind'. This could have taken the form of an equivalent value in shares in the operations of one of the subsidiaries of the national mining company to a maximum of 30% stake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guineepresse.info/index.php?id=10,10358,0,0,1,0 GuineePress, "Alpha Condé et les mines: délit de haute trahison. Voici les preuves"], ''GuineePresse'' (8 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Palladino C2 wrote to the Minister of Mines requiring an account of how the funds had been utilised. In the absence of a reply, formal notice was given by Palladino C2 requiring an immediate repayment of the loan, with interest.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in.reuters.com"&gt;Reuters [http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/06/19/guinea-loan-idINL5E8HJIKG20120619 "Guinea to pay back $25 mln Palladino loan"]&lt;/ref&gt; The loan was repaid on July 11, 2012.

===Allegations about the Loan Agreement===
In June 2012, the Sunday Times published an article about the Loan Agreement, and focussed on the default provision included in the agreement.&lt;ref name="TST"/&gt;  It added that the loan had never been publicly revealed to Guineans, or ticked off in the national budget, although President Alpha Condé has said that "contracts that commit Guinea will be published on the Internet."

Former Guinean Minister of Mines, Mahmoud Thiam was quoted in various newspapers as alleging that the deal was a quid pro quo in return for Condé campaign support.&lt;ref&gt;Craig McKune, Stefaans Brummer and James Wood, [http://mg.co.za/article/2012-06-28-tokyo-linked-company-in-guinea-row/ "Tokyo-linked company in Guinea row"], ''Mail &amp; Guardian'' (29 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mail &amp; Guardian alleged that as a result of the loan to Guinea, Guinea would not be permitted to sell any state interest in a mining asset without first offering the option to Palladino and should the firm wish to acquire a stake in a mining asset, it would be granted the privilege of a six-month negotiating period. If a deal could not then be struck, Guinea would only be allowed to negotiate with a third party without first right of refusal from Palladino.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2012-06-28-tokyo-linked-company-in-guinea-row/ Craig McKune, Stefaans Brummer and James Wood, "Tokyo-linked company in Guinea row"], ''Mail &amp; Guardian'' (29 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response from Palladino====
Following the publication of the Sunday Times article, Hennig's company, Palladino, issued a number of public statements about the Loan Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Metal Bulletin [http://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3044259/Palladino-denies-default-provision-in-Guinean-deal-would-give.html?eventcookielogin=Login&amp;cookielogin=1&amp;actionname=cookielogin&amp;eid=E017 "Palladino denies default provision in Guinean deal would give it 30% stake in assets"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Palladino highlighted that the Loan Agreement contained customary default provisions but given the limited cash resources of the government, it also provided that in event of a default it could be repaid in cash and/or in kind.  Lawyers emphasised that this repayment could not legally exceed the value of the debt due under the loan agreement and said that it could "in no way result in the appropriation of 30 percent of private or national assets worth billions of dollars".&lt;ref name="in.reuters.com"/&gt;

====Response from the Guinean Government====

=====Public statement=====
The Guinean government also refused the allegations made by The Sunday Times and affirmed that there was no automatic convertibility to a 30 percent stake in Soguipami in case of default.&lt;ref&gt;factuguinee http://www.factuguinee.com/fichiers/videos5.php?langue=fr&amp;idc=fr_Communiqu__de_Presse_conjoint___Minist_re_des_Mines__Minist_r&lt;/ref&gt;  Guinea's minister of mines said that repayment would be at a value linked to the loan amount and accumulated interest and added that "the probability of Soguipami defaulting on this loan is minimal".  The government also emphasised that the loan was not taken out by the Republic of Guinea, but by Soguipami, a parastal entity that was set up in September 2011 to manage the government's stakes in mining contracts. It was clarified that the loan was not collateralised by Soguipami itself, but by one of its subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;Metal Bulletin [http://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3047442/Search/Guinean-minister-Fofana-rebuts-Sunday-Times-claims-about.html?PageId=196010&amp;Keywords=palladino&amp;OrderType=1 "Guinean minister Fofana rebuts Sunday Times' claims about Palladino deal" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====CNT investigation=====
The CNT, the country's acting legislative body, convened a special plenary session on 28 June 2012,and called upon the two ministers to explain the agreement. Both ministers defended the legality of their actions and explained that the funds had been sought for the operationalisation of the National Mining Company. The funds were kept in an account at the Central Bank foreign holdings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africalog.com/news/audition-de-kerfalla-yansane-et-mohamed-lamine-fofana-par-le-cnt Africalog, "Audition de Kerfalla Yansané et Mohamed Lamine Fofana par le CNT"], ''Africalog'' (28 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; No evidence of wrongdoing was found by the CNT and the matter has been dropped. Government official have announced that the full amount of the loan along with interests has been paid to the lenders thus concluding the matter.&lt;ref name="TST"/&gt;

She was tried in 2016 but did not appear in court in August 2017 for the verdict. An arrest warrant was issued. She reportedly fled the country. In September 2017, she was found guilty in absentia and sentenced to five years in prison. She is rumoured to now be in London, England.

Yingluck began her career as a sales and marketing intern in 1993 at Shinawatra Directories Co., Ltd., a [[telephone directory]] business founded by [[AT&amp;T|AT&amp;T International]]. She later became the director of procurement and the director of operations.

Yingluck received 0.68 percent of Shin Corp shares out of the 46.87 percent that [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] and his then-wife held in 1999. The military junta-appointed [[Assets Examination Committee (Thailand)|Assets Examination Committee]] charged that Yingluck made up false transactions and that "there were no real payments for each Ample Rich Co., Ltd shares sold" and "the transactions were made at a cost basis of par value in order to avoid income taxes, and all the dividends paid out by Shin to those people were transferred to [her sister-in-law] Potjaman's bank accounts".

After the governing [[People's Power Party (Thailand)|People's Power party]] was dissolved and its executive board was banned from political activity for five years by the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]] on 2 December 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thai premier banned from politics, ruling party dissolved: court |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hfJ-lAMzPxNPjyXUtOzsYlEvJeow |location=Bangkok |date= 1 December 2008 |agency=AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt; the former People's Power Party MPs formed the Pheu Thai Party. Yingluck was asked to become the party's leader, but she declined, saying that she had no desire to be prime minister and wanted to concentrate on business.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |script-title=th:ก๊ก"มิ่งขวัญ"ขวาง"ยิ่งลักษณ์"นั่งหัวหน้า พท. อ้าง"ผู้จัดการอำนาจ"ไม่ปลื้มนามสกุล"ชินวัตร" |date=6 January 2011 |language=Thai |newspaper=Matichon Online |location=Bangkok |trans-title="Mingkwan" faction obstructs "Yingluck" as PTP leader, claims "power manager" does not like surname "Shinawatra"}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yongyuth Wichaidit]] became the leader of the party.

US diplomatic cables [[Cablegate|leaked]] in 2011 revealed that during a 9 September 2009 meeting, former Deputy Prime Minister and "close Thaksin ally" Sompong Amornvivat told Ambassador to Thailand Eric John that he did not envision a big role for Yingluck in the Pheu Thai Party, and that "Thaksin himself was not eager to raise her profile within the party, and was more focused on finding ways to keep his own hand active in politics." However, in a subsequent cable dated 25 November 2009, the ambassador noted that in a meeting with Yingluck, she spoke with confidence about the "operations, strategy and goals" of the Pheu Thai party and seemed "far more poised" than in previous meetings. The cable cited Yingluck saying that, "Someone could easily emerge relatively late in the game to take the reins of the party and serve as the next Prime Minister."&lt;ref&gt;AP, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-a36bd1d5cd074db89149230b913a05db.html US envoy in 2009 forecast rise of Thaksin's sister], 14 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Yingluck's bank account was among 86 accounts that the Abhisit government accused of being used to finance the [[United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship|Red Shirt]] protesters during their [[2010 Thai political protests|demonstrations in 2010]]. Abhisit accused the Red Shirts of trying to overthrow the monarchy, something they denied. However, the government did not pursue any legal action against her. The Department for Special Investigation found that from 28 April 2009 to May 2010, 150 million baht was deposited into one of her accounts while 166&amp;nbsp;million baht was withdrawn. On 28 April 2010 alone, 144&amp;nbsp;million baht was withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=th:ดีเอสไอโชว์ผลงานตรวจท่อน้ำเลี้ยงเสื้อแดง |date=17 June 2010 |language=Thai |newspaper=Post Today |location=Bangkok |trans-title=DSI shows red shirt funding |agency=Siam Intelligence }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pheu Thai Party leadership ===
Yongyuth had stated his intention of resigning as party leader in late 2010. Speculation about a snap election in early 2011 heightened internal debate over the party leadership. The front runners were Yingluck and Mingkwan Sangsuwan, who had led the opposition in an unsuccessful [[motion of no confidence]] against the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]]-led coalition government. As late as 28 January 2011, Yingluck continued to rule out the party leadership, repeating that she wanted to focus on business. However, she was endorsed by veteran politician [[Chalerm Yubamrung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Srisamorn |last=Phoosuphanusorn |title=Yingluck rules out taking Puea Thai helm |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/218585/yingluck-rules-out-taking-puea-thai-helm |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=28 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2011, the Pheu Thai party voted to name Yingluck as their top candidate under the [[Party-list proportional representation|party-list]] system (and presumably be the party's nominee for Prime Minister) for parliamentary election scheduled for 3 July. However, she was not made party leader and did not join the party's executive board. The ultimate decision was made by Thaksin himself. "Some said she is my nominee. That's not true. But it can be said that Yingluck is my clone... Another important thing is that Ms Yingluck is my sister and she can make decisions for me. She can say 'yes' or 'no' on my behalf," noted Thaksin in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |newspaper=Bangkok Post |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/237363/yingluck-takes-centre-stage |title=Yingluck takes centre stage |date=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 election and rise to premiership ===
{{main|Thai general election, 2011}}

==== Election campaign ====

Pheu Thai campaigned with a slogan of "Thaksin thinks, Pheu Thai acts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14009184 |title=Thailand army 'will accept' Thaksin sister election win |publisher=BBC News |date=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yingluck's main campaign theme was [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]] following the [[2008–2010 Thai political crisis|extended political crisis from 2008 to 2010]], culminating in the [[2010 Thai military crackdown|military crackdown on protesters]] which left nearly 100 protesters dead and thousands injured. She promised to empower the Independent Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Thailand (ITRC), the panel that the Democrat-led government had set up to investigate the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yingluck: We'll reconcile |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_686725.html |newspaper=The Straits Times |date=3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ITRC had complained that its work was hampered by the military and the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Achara |last=Ashayagachat |title=One year on, truth about crackdown remains elusive |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/232901/one-year-on-truth-about-crackdown-remains-elusive |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=21 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yingluck also proposed a general [[amnesty]] for all major politically motivated incidents that had taken place since the 2006 coup, which could include the coup itself, court rulings banning [[Thai Rak Thai Party|Thai Rak Thai]] and [[People's Power Party (Thailand)|People's Power Party]] leaders from seeking office, the [[People's Alliance for Democracy]] (PAD) seizures of Government House and [[Seizure of Don Muang and Suvarnabhumi Airports|Don Muang and Suvarnabhumi Airports]], the military crackdowns of 2009 and 2010, and the conviction of Thaksin Shinawatra for abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;Xin Hua, [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/database/2011-07/04/c_13964544_2.htm Profile: Yingluck Shinawatra], 4 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was fiercely attacked by the government, who claimed that it would specifically give amnesty to Thaksin, and also result in the return to him of the 46&amp;nbsp;billion [[Thai baht|baht]] of his wealth that the government had seized as a penalty. However, Yingluck denied that the return of seized assets was a priority for the Pheu Thai party, and repeated that she had no intention of giving amnesty to any one person. Abhisit claimed outright that Yingluck was lying and that amnesty to Thaksin actually was the Pheu Thai party's policy.&lt;ref&gt;Abhisit Vejjajiva, [http://www.facebook.com/notes/abhisit-vejjajiva/จากใจอภิสิทธิ์ถึงคนไทยทั้งประเทศ-6/218400991534000 จากใจอภิสิทธิ์ถึงคนไทยทั้งประเทศ]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The government blamed Pheu Thai for the bloodshed during the military crackdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Abhisit: It's us or chaos |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_686726.html |newspaper=The Straits Times |date=3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her agricultural policies included improving operating cashflow to farmers and providing loans of up to 70 percent of expected income, based on a guaranteed rice price of 15,000 [[Thai baht|baht]] per ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Fernquest |title=Credit cards for farmers and more |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/learning-from-news/239306/agricultural-policy-platforms |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=27 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also planned to provide free public [[Wi-Fi]] and a [[Tablet computer|tablet PC]] to every schoolchild (a Thai Rak Thai Party plan to provide [[OLPC|one laptop per child]] was cancelled after the 2006 military coup).&lt;ref&gt;Yingluck Shinawatra, [http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=186419291413820 วิเคราะห์ โครงการคอมพิวเตอร์มือถือสำหรับนักเรียนทุกคน (One Tablet PC Per Child) ของพรรคเพื่อไทย], Thursday, 30 June 2011 at 5:46&amp;nbsp;pm&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==== Election results and the establishment of the government ====
[[Exit polls]] indicated a landslide victory, with Pheu Thai projected to win as many as 310 seats in the 500-seat [[House of Representatives of Thailand|parliament]].&lt;ref name="exit polls"&gt;{{cite news

United Nations secretary-general [[Ban Ki-moon]] welcomed the outcome of the elections and called for all parties to "respect the will of the Thai people as expressed through the democratic process." [[Aung San Su Kyi]] congratulated Yingluck, praised the election as "free and fair," and said that she expected "the ties between Myanmar and Thailand to get better."&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/05/us-myanmar-suukyi-idUSTRE7641AG20110705 Myanmar's Suu Kyi keeps low profile on upcountry trip], 5 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lamphai |last=Intathep |title=Suu Kyi welcomes outcome |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/245633/suu-kyi-welcomes-outcome |agency=AFP |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=6 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yingluck quickly formed a coalition with the [[Chartthaipattana Party|Chartthaipattana]] (19 seats), [[Chart Pattana Puea Pandin Party|Chart Pattana Puea Pandin]] (7 seats), and [[Phalang Chon Party|Phalang Chon]] (7 seats), and [[Mahachon Party|Mahachon]] (1 seat), and New Democracy (1 seat) parties, giving her a total of 300 seats.&lt;ref&gt;Jagran Post, Yingluck to lead Thailand coalition; military accepts poll verdict, 5 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/245905/new-democrat-6th-in-yingluck-coalition |title=NDP joins coalition |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outgoing [[Ministry of Defence (Thailand)|Defense Minister]] General [[Prawit Wongsuwan]] said that he accepted the election results, and after having talked with military leaders, would not intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gen Prawit: Army accepts election |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/245365/thai-military-accepts-election-defence-minister |agency=AFP |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=4 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yingluck established her Council of Ministers on 9 August. She and her Ministers were sworn in on 10 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.thairath.co.th/content/pol/192805 |title=New cabinet set up. |newspaper=Thairath|date=9 August 2011 |accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were then required to complete addressing their administrative policy to the National Assembly. According to the Constitution, the address had to be made within fifteen days from the effective date of the Proclamation on Yingluck's appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thairath.co.th/today/view/192344 |title= Chaloem to be Deputy PM. |date= 8 August 2011 |publisher=Thairath | accessdate =8 August 2011 |language= Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key members of [[Yingluck cabinet|Yingluck's cabinet]] include former Interior Permanent Secretary [[Yongyuth Wichaidit]] as Interior Minister, Securities and Exchange Commission Secretary-General [[Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala]] as Finance Minister, and former Defense Permanent Secretary General [[Yuthasak Sasiprapa]] as Defense Minister. Absent from Yingluck's cabinet were [[United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship|Red Shirts]] who had spearheaded protests against the Democrat-led government.

Polls from shortly after her cabinet was announced found that the cabinet rated most highly in terms of economic competency. It also showed that Yingluck was much more popular than her exiled brother Thaksin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Bangkok Pundit | url = http://asiancorrespondent.com/62611/polls-show-yingluck-is-the-most-popular-minister-%E2%80%93-part-2/ | title = Polls show Yingluck is most popular Thai Minister – Part 2 | date = 17 August 2011 | publisher = Asian correspondent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 floods ===

The 2011 [[rainy season]] saw the highest levels of rainfall in Thailand in the previous 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = CNN | newspaper = World Business Times | date = 21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding started in northern Thailand on 31 July, a week prior to Yingluck's appointment as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Bangkok Post | title = North, Northeast inundated by effects of Nock-ten | date = 1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding quickly spread from the North to the Central [[Chao Phraya River]] Basin, and by the beginning of October, the [[phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya District|province of Ayutthaya]], north of Bangkok, was almost flooded. The floods were the worst in Thailand in over 50 years. Yingluck established centralised flood monitoring and relief operations in mid-August and made tours of flooded provinces beginning 12 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Bangkok Post | title = Yingluck to visit flooded provinces | date = 12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yingluck also pledged to invest in long-term flood prevention projects, including the construction of drainage canals. Flood reduction measures were hampered by disputes between people on the different sides of flood barriers: those on the flooded side in some instances sabotaged the barriers, sometimes resulting in armed confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Bangkok Post | title = Death toll in ravaged provinces climbs to 37 | date = 22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Nation | title = La Nina to raise risk of flooding | date = 23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva and military leaders called for Yingluck to declare a [[state of emergency]], claiming that it would give the military greater authority to deal with embankment sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Military wants PM to declare state of emergency in capital | newspaper = The Nation | date = 15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A state of emergency had last been declared in 2010 during the Abhisit-government's crackdown on anti-government protesters. Yingluck refused to declare a state of emergency, saying that it would not improve flood management. Instead, she invoked the 2007 Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Act and issued a disaster warning which gave her government greater authority to manage flood control and drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Nation | url = http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Disaster-warning-issued-for-Bangkok-30168212.html | title = Disaster warning issued for Bangkok | date = 21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cabinet reshuffle ===
[[File:Martin Zeil und Yingluck Shinawatra 3783.JPG|thumb|Yingluck Shinawatra in [[Munich]] with [[Bavaria]]n minister for economy [[Martin Zeil]]]]

On 18 January 2012, Yingluck reshuffled her cabinet, assigning six cabinet members to new posts, naming ten new ministers and deputies and dismissing nine members of the government.&lt;ref name="Overhauling"&gt;{{Citation |title=Drastic overhauling for Thai Cabinet |publisher=Asia One |date=18 January 2012 |url= http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20120118-322543.html |accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regrouping was assessed as a step to increase loyalty to the head of government and a reaction to discontent with the government's management of the [[2011 Thailand floods|flood disaster]].&lt;ref name="Overhauling"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = http://english.cri.cn/6966/2012/01/19/2743s677094.htm |title=Yingluck Enhances Unity with Cabinet Reshuffle |publisher=CRI|date=19 January 2012|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially noted was the choice of [[Nalinee Taveesin]] (Minister in the PM's Office), who is on a US blacklist for alleged business links to Zimbabwean President [[Robert Mugabe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL3E8CJ1DQ20120119 |first=Martin|last=Petty|title=Thai PM gives cabinet post to U.S. blacklisted businesswoman|work=Reuters|date=19 January 2012|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jhFaoVcAfOolpvbp4Uj8UGsEDCdA?docId=CNG.9081bc8797787335271f45ae49aca168.361 |title= New Thai minister on US blacklist for Mugabe links| work= AFP | date = 19 January 2012|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20120119-322747.html | title = New Thai minister on US blacklist |work= Asia One|date= 19 January 2012|accessdate= 19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nattawut Saikua]] (Deputy Minister of Agriculture), the first leader of the [[United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship]] (UDD, or "Red Shirts") in the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url= http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/489966 | title =A new cabinet reshuffle in Thailand|work=Bahrain News Agency (BNA) |date=19 January 2012|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Thanyarat | last = Doksone|title=Thai 'Red Shirt' Firebrand Appointed to Cabinet|work=ABC News |date=18 January 2012 |url= http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/thai-red-shirt-firebrand-appointed-cabinet-15386024 |accessdate= 19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title= Blacklisted Businesswoman, Red Shirt Leader Join Thai Cabinet|work= Voice of America|date= 18 January 2012| url= http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2012/01/18/blacklisted-businesswoman-red-shirt-leader-join-thai-cabinet/|accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yingluck's first cabinet had not incorporated any "Red Shirts" activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Pavin|last = Chachavalpongpun | title =Thailand's New Yingluck Cabinet|work=Asia Sentinel|date=10 August 2010|url= http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3376&amp;Itemid=387 |accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013/14 Opposition protests, supreme court impeachment and coup ===
{{main|2013–14 Thai political crisis}}

On 9 December 2013, Yingluck dissolved the country's parliament and called early elections in the face of anti-government protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Calamur | first =Krishnadev |title= Thai Prime Minister Dissolves Parliament, Calls New Elections| url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/12/09/249729649/thai-prime-minister-dissolves-parliament-calls-new-elections |publisher=NPR|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 May 2014, the Constitutional Court unanimously dismissed Yingluck from office in consequence of her removing an appointee of an earlier government, Thawil Pliensri, from his post as National Security Council secretary-general in 2011. The court deemed the transfer unconstitutional and therefore, removed Yingluck from office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Court rules on PM's fate |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/408457 |location=Bangkok |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=7 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks after Yingluck was impeached, the military coup of 2014 occurred.

=== 2014 negligence of duty investigation and trial ===

Based on the 2007 Thai constitution, public officials can be charged and imprisoned for abuse of power and negligence, even without proof of corruption.

As chairperson of the rice committee, Yingluck was investigated by Thailand's anti-graft agency about her role in the rice pledging scheme. Two of her former ministers were also investigated, and later sentenced for decades in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yingluck to be probed, ex-ministers charged on rice scheme|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/389909/yingluck-to-be-probed-ex-ministers-charged-on-rice-scheme|publisher=Post Publishing|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being chairperson of the rice committee, Yingluck admitted in the 2013 censure debate against her government that she had never attended meetings of the National Rice Policy Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PM Admits Rice Panel Absences|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/382021/pm-admits-rice-panel-absences|publisher=Post Publishing|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May 2014, the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) unanimously agreed to indict Yingluck in the rice-pledging scheme corruption case citing millions of rice farmers who remain unpaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ousted Yingluck to face impeachment over rice-pledging scheme |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Ousted-Yingluck-to-face-impeachment-over-rice-pled-30233176.html |location=Bangkok |newspaper=The Nation |date=8 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yingluck indicted on rice-pledging scheme  |url=http://www.china.org.cn/world/2014-05/08/content_32330719.htm|location=China |newspaper=Xinhua|date=8 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Business lobbies, academics blast rice subsidies, govt's 'insincere' anti-graft sentiments  |url=http://tdri.or.th/en/tdri-insight/business-lobbies-academics-blast-rice-subsidies-govts-insincere-anti-graft-sentiments/|location=Thailand|date=13 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November, Thailand's National Legislative Assembly (NLA) denied the addition of 72 pieces of evidence to her rice-pledging case.
