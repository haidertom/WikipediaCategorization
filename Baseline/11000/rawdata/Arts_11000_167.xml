'''Actual Art''' is a genre of art that was first named by critic [[Alfred Frankenstein]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' in a review of [[Helene Aylon]]’s work.  The name was chosen because the art was "real", but the term ''[[Realism (arts)|realism]]'' was already in use.&lt;ref name="Frankenstein"&gt;[Frankenstein, Alfred. San Francisco Chronicle, "NY, Helene Aylon" September 28, 1975]&lt;/ref&gt; Frankenstein described Aylon's work as a genre of art that involves “the self-conscious enlistment of the forces of nature, by artists, toward the completion of their art”.&lt;ref name="Frankenstein"/&gt; Collaboration with nature necessarily brings the dimension of time into as an integral component of the artworks, with some requiring many thousands of years for their completion. The artists consider the future of the work to be as important as its present, relinquishing control over the work to nature.&lt;ref&gt;"Fugate-Wilcox's deliberate yielding to the forces over which he has no control measures his awareness of the power of nature." Jonathon Goodman, ''Art in America'' (Dec. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!-- [[Image:Redspot.jpg|thumb|right|300px|"Red Spot" painting of 21st century material; a paint that never dries, by Tery Fugate-Wilcox]] --&gt;

==History==
In 1982, the Actual Art Foundation formed in the [[Tribeca]] district of New York City to promote exclusively artists working in the Actual Art genre, and in 1985, obtained its 501-C3 not-for-profit tax-exempt status to fund exhibitions of Actual Art and projects proposed by Actual Artists.  The most notable early exhibitions sponsored by the Actual Art Foundation were:

* "It's About Time" at the New York City Gallery in 1983
* "Time Will Tell" at Squibb International, Princeton, NJ in 1984
* "Slow Kinetic Art" at the Wadsworth Athenium, Hartfortd, CT
* "Time Waits..." co-sponsored with [[Johannes, 11th Prince of Thurn and Taxis]] and his wife [[Gloria, Princess of Thurn and Taxis|Gloria]] at [[St. Emmeram's Abbey|Schloss St. Emmeram]] in [[Regensburg]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].

The "Time Will Tell" exhibit was documented in articles appearing in the ''New York Times'', the ''Bergen County Record'', the ''Princeton Packet'', and the ''Trentonian''.&lt;ref&gt;Lou Cook, "Actual Exhibit at Squibb", ''Trentonian'', June 4, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The headquarters of Actual Art Foundation was also used for an episode of Law &amp; Order circa 1990, featuring Actual Art. Actual Art Foundation lost its Tribeca headquarters in the attacks of [[9/11]] and created an Art Center at Candlewood Lake in Connecticut&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actvalartfovndation.blogspot.com www.actvalartfovndation.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
In Actual Art, what future generations will see is programmed into the work, making time an element of the work, as well as space, form or color. The artists introduce time as a tool in the making of art. Actual Art is about energy; specifically, about the energy and life in the materials. Words like “decay”, “deterioration” or “destruction” are replaced with “change”.&lt;ref&gt;[Weiss, Paulette. "Actual Art at Fulcrum Gallery" '''Where Magazine''', July 1997 illust]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tery Fugate-Wilcox]] is quoted as saying, “The work will last forever, as long as you understand it changes.”&lt;ref&gt;K. Lancion, “Contrarian Gallery gains Cultural Leverage”, ''Craine’s Small Business'', January 9, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Actual Art moves one to think about ways to work with nature instead of fighting it. In place of the constant attempts to inhibit materials’ natural tendency to change (to the detriment of the planet), man might be examining and exploiting the inherent qualities of the materials we work with. Actual Artists have a visionary sense of the natural order of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;[Randell, Susan '''Manhattan Arts International'''  June-Aug, 1994 pg. 6, Illust]&lt;/ref&gt;

This {{convert|1|acre|m2|sing=on}} slab of concrete, {{convert|20|ft|m}} thick is intended to span the San Andreas Fault, which will rip the artwork in half, with the west half traveling north towards Alaska over the next few million years or so.&lt;ref&gt;[Walker, Michael.

'''Akan goldweights''', (locally known as '''mrammou'''), are weights made of brass used as a measuring system by the [[Akan people]] of [[West Africa]], particularly for weighing gold dust which was [[currency]] until replaced by paper money and coins.

Used to weigh gold and merchandise, at first glance the goldweights look like miniature models of everyday objects. Based on the [[Islamic]] weight system, each weight had a known measurement. This provided merchants with secure and fair-trade arrangements with one another. The status of a man increased significantly if he owned a complete set of weights. Complete small sets of weights were gifts to newly wedded men. This insured that he would be able to enter the merchant trade respectably and successfully.

Beyond their practical application, the weights are miniature representations of [[West African]] culture items such as [[adinkra symbols]], plants, animals and people.{{ref|Garrard1}}&lt;ref name="Bakewell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilks,Ivor. Wangara, Akan, and Portuguese in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|editor1-last=Bakewell|editor1-first=Peter|title=Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas|date=1997|publisher=Variorum, Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Aldershot|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Dating the weights==
Stylistic studies of goldweights can provide relative dates into the two broad early and late periods. The Early period is thought to have been from about 1400–1720 AD, with some overlap with the Late period, 1700-1900 AD.{{ref|Garrard1}} There is a distinct difference between the Early and Late periods. [[Geometric]] weights are the oldest forms, dating from 1400 AD onwards while figurative weights, those made in the image of people, animals, building etc., first appear around 1600 AD.{{ref|Garrard4}}.

Radiocarbon dating, a standard and accurate method in many disciplines, cannot be used to date the weights, as it is an inorganic material. The base components of inorganic materials, such as metals, formed long before the manufacturing of the artifact.{{ref|Garrard2}} The [[copper]] and [[zinc]] used to make the alloy are exponentially older than the artifact itself. Studies on the quality or origins of the [[base metal]]s in [[brass]] are not very useful due to the broad distribution and recycling of the material.

Studying the weight’s cultural background or provenance is an accurate method of dating the weights. Historical records accompanying the weight describing the people to whom it belonged to, as well as a comparative study of the weights and oral and artistic traditions of neighbouring communities should be part of studying the background and provenance of the weights.{{ref|Danguah1}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Meanings behind the weights==
Scholars use the weights, and the oral traditions behind the weights, to understand aspects of [[Akan people#Elements of Akan culture|Akan culture]] that otherwise may have been lost. The weights represent stories, riddles, and code of conducts that helped guide Akan peoples in the ways they live their lives. Central to Akan culture is the concern for equality and justice; it is rich in oral histories on this subject. Many weights symbolize significant and well-known stories. The weights were part of the Akan's cultural reinforcement, expressing personal behaviour codes, beliefs, and values in a medium that was assembled by many people.{{ref|Garrard3}}

[[Anthony Appiah]] describes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Appiah|first=Kwame Anthony|title=In my father's house: Africa in the philosophy of culture|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-506852-8|edition=1.  paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;  how his mother, who collected goldweights, was visited by Muslim [[Hausa people|Hausa]] traders from the north. The goldweights they brought were "sold by people who had no use for them any more, now that paper and coin had replaced gold-dust as currency. And as she collected them, she heard more and more of the folklore that went with them; the proverbs that every figurative gold-weight elicited; the folk-tales, Ananseasem, that the proverbs evoked." Appiah also heard these Ananseasem, [[Anansi]] stories, from his father, and writes: "Between his stories and the cultural messages that came with the gold-weights, we gathered the sort of sense of a cultural tradition that comes from growing up in it. For us it was not Asante tradition but the webwork of our lives."

There are a number of parallels between Akan goldweights and the seals used in [[Harappa]]. Both artifacts stabilized and secured regional and local trade between peoples, while they took on further meaning beyond their practical uses.{{ref|Garrard5}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Shields are symbols of bravery, stamina, or a glorious deed, though not necessarily in battle. Double-edged swords symbolize a joint rule between female and male, rather than implying violence or rule with fear. The naming of the weights is incredibly complex, as a complete list of Akan weights had more than sixty values, and each set had a local name that varied regionally. There are, from studies done by Garrard, twelve weight-name lists from [[Ghana]] and the [[Ivory Coast]].{{ref|Garrard3}}

==Collections of weights==
Some estimate that there are 3 million goldweights in existence. [[Simon Fraser University]] has a small collection, consisting mostly of geometric style weights, with a number of human figurative weights. Both types are pictured here and come from the [[SFU]] Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography. Many of the largest museums of in the U.S.A. and Europe have sizable collections of goldweights. The [[National Museum of Ghana]], the [[:fr:Musée des civilisations de Côte d'Ivoire|Musée des Civilisations de Côte d'Ivoire]] in Abidjan,&lt;ref name="MdCAbidjan"&gt;
{{cite web

==Manufacture of the weights==
In the past, each weight was meticulously carved, then cast using the ancient technique of [[Lost-wax casting|lost wax]]. As the Akan culture moved away from using gold as the basis of their economy, the weights lost their cultural day-to-day use and some of their significance. Their popularity with tourists has created a market that the locals fill with mass-produced weights. These modern reproductions of the weights have become a tourist favorite. Rather than the simple but artistic facial features of the [[anthropomorphic]] weights or the clean, smooth lines of the geomorphic weights, modern weights are unrefined and mass-produced look. The strong oral tradition of the Akan is not included in the creation of the weights; however, this does not seem to lessen their popularity.

The skill involved in casting weights was enormous; as most weights were less than 2½ ounces and their exact mass was meticulously measured. They were a standard of measure to be used in trade, and had to be accurate. The [[goldsmith]], or ''adwumfo'', would make adjustments if the casting weighed too much or too little. Even the most beautiful, figurative weights had limbs and horns removed, or edges filed down until it met the closest weight equivalent. Weights that were not heavy enough would have small lead rings or glass beads attached to bring up the weight to the desired standard. There are far more weights without modifications than not, speaking to the talent of the goldsmiths. Most weights were within 3% of their theoretical value; this variance is similar to those of European nest weights from the same time{{ref|Garrard2}}.

Early weights display bold, but simple, artistic designs. Later weights developed into beautiful works of art with fine details. However, by the 1890s (Late Period) the quality of both design and material was very poor, and the abandonment of the weights quickly followed.

Tim Garrard (April 28, 1943 – May 17, 2007) studied the Akan gold culture. His research was centered on goldweights and their cultural significances and purposes. He was also interested in the gold trade, the creation of the weight measurements, and how Akan trade networks operated with other networks. His works and those that use his work as a base are very informative about broader Akan culture.

The weights pictured here are part of the collection at the [http://www.sfu.museum SFU museum]. Donated to the museum in the late 1970s, they are part of a wide collection of [[Africa]]n cultural pieces.

The '''Ashta-Nayika''' is a collective name for eight types of ''nayika''s or heroines as classified by [[Bharata Muni|Bharata]] in his [[Sanskrit]] treatise on [[performing arts]] - ''[[Natya Shastra]]''. The eight nayikas represent eight different states (''avastha'') in relationship to her hero or ''nayaka''.&lt;ref name="sahitya"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature |volume=2|year=2005|publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]]|isbn=81-260-1194-7|chapter=Erotic Literature (Sanskrit)}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[archetypal]] states of the [[Romance (love)|romantic]] heroine, it has been used as theme in [[Indian painting]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian sculpture|sculpture]] as well as [[Indian classical dance]] and [[music]].

==History and cultural depictions==
[[File:Deceived Heroine (Vipralabdha), Nayika Painting Appended to a Ragamala (Garland of Melodies) LACMA M.73.2.5.jpg|thumb|Vipralabdha throwing away her jewellery.]]
The Ashta-Nayika classification (''nayika-bheda'') first appears in ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' (24.210-11), a key [[Sanskrit]] treatise on Indian [[performing arts]], authored by [[Bharata Muni|Bharata]] (dated between 2nd century BC and 2nd century AD).&lt;ref name="sahitya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="music"&gt;{{cite book|last=Luiz Martinez|first= José |title=Semiosis in Hindustani music|year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidas Publishers|isbn=81-208-1801-6|pages=288–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification is detailed in later works like the ''Dasarupaka'' (10th century), ''[[Sahityadarpana]]'' (14th century) and various other treatises on poetics as well as erotic ''[[Kamashastra]]'' texts like Kuttanimata (8th-9th century) based on courtesans, ''Panchasayaka'', ''Anangaranga'' and ''Smaradipika''. [[Keshavdas|Keshavadasa]]'s ''Rasikapriya'' (16th century) in [[Hindi]], also elaborates on the Ashta-nayika.&lt;ref name="sodhi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sodhi|first=Jiwan|title=A study of Bundi school of painting|year=1999|publisher=Abinav Publishers|isbn=81-7017-347-7|pages=52–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ashta-Nayika have been illustrated in [[Indian painting]], literature, sculpture as well as [[Indian classical dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Banerji|first=Projesh |title=Dance in thumri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsuhSiITjU8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA13&amp;dq=Ashta+Nayika|year=1986|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=81-7017-212-8|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"&gt;{{cite book|last=Varadpande|first=Manohar Laxman |title=Woman in Indian sculpture|year=2006|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=81-7017-474-0|pages=93–106|chapter=Shringara nayika}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable medieval paintings that depict the Ashta nayika are the [[Ragamala paintings]], as those from the [[Bundi]] school of painting.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;

A famous example in Indian literature is [[Jayadeva]]'s ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' (12th century) as well as in the [[Vaishnava]] poet Banamali's compositions, [[Radha]] dons the roles of the various nayikas while with her nayaka is the god [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/09/14/stories/2007091450100200.htm|title=Learn the lingo|date=Sep 14, 2007|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ashta-Nayika is a central theme in ''Pahari embroidery'' used to decorate the ''Chamba [[Rumal]]'', especially produced in [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh|Chamba]], [[Himachal Pradesh]]. The Ashta Nayika are usually portrayed in eight panels on the Rumal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naik|first=Shailaja D. |title=Traditional embroideries of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNAwl-jS3gwC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=%22Ashta+Nayika%22|year=1996|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=81-7024-731-4|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indian (Hindustani) classical music, the eternal love between [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]] is represented through the consciousness of [[Radha]] as the leitmotif that dominates the lyrics. Especially the semi-classical genre of [[Thumri]] imbibes the myriad moods of [[Radha]] as Ashta Nayika consumed by passionate love for [[Krishna]].

==The classification==
The ''Natya Shastra'' describes the nayikas in the following order: Vasakasajja, Virahotkanthita, Svadhinabhartruka, Kalahantarita, Khandita, Vipralabdha, Proshitabhartruka and Abhisarika. The nayikas are further classified in two varieties of the ''[[shringara]] rasa'', the ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' related to love: Sambhoga (love in meeting) and Vipralambha (love in separation). Vasakasajja, Svadhinabhartruka and Abhisarika are associated with  Sambhoga; the others with Vipralambha.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

In the ''Shringara Prakasha'', Bhoja relates the various nayakas and nayikas with musical ''[[raga]]''s and ''ragini''s (a female raga). Somanatha's ''Ragavibodha'' (1609) and Damodara's ''Sangitadarpana'' (c. 1625) continue this trend.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Vasakasajja===

Vasakasajja ("one dressed up for union")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Vasakasajjika is waiting for her lover returning from a long journey. She is depicted in her bed-chamber filled with lotus leaves and garlands.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; She is dressing herself for the union with her lover and "eager with expectation of love's pleasure".&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; Her beauty is compared by Kesavadasa to [[Rati]] - the Hindu love goddess, waiting for her husband, the love god [[Kamadeva]].&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; A Vasakasajja sculpture is found in the Lakshmana Temple in [[Khajuraho]] and the National Museum, Delhi.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

The ''Ragavibodha'' associates the raginis [[Bhupali]] and [[Todi]] with Vasakasajja.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Virahotkanthita===

Virahotkanthita ("One distressed by separation")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Utka (as described by Keshavadasa) is the distressed heroine pining for her lover, who, due to his preoccupation, fails to return home. She is depicted waiting for him, sitting or standing on a bed or out in the pavilion.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;

The ''Ragavibodha'' identifies the raginis Mukhari, Pauravi and Turushkatodi with the Virahotkanthita, while the ''Sangitadarpana'' names Patamanjari in this category.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Svadhinabhartruka===

}}

Svadhinabhartruka ("one having her husband in subjection")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Svadhinapatika(as named by Keshavadasa) is the woman who is loved by her husband and controls him. He is subjugated by her intense love and pleasing qualities.He is devoted and faithful to her
&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; In paintings, this nayika is depicted with a nayaka, who applies ''[[Alta (dye)|mahawar]]'' on her feet or a vermilion [[tilak]] (mark) on her forehead.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; In [[Jayadeva]]'s [[Gita Govinda]] as well as in the poem ''Kuru Yadunandana'', [[Radha]] is portrayed as a Svadhinabhartruka. In the latter, Radha commands her lover, the god [[Krishna]], to rearrange her makeup which is in disarray due to their fierce [[coitus]].&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

Many raginis like Malashri, Travanika, Ramakriti, Jaitashri and Purvi  are associated with Svadhinabhartruka.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Kalahantarita===

Kalahantarita ("one separated by quarrel")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Abhisandhita (as named by Keshavadasa)&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; is a heroine separated from her lover due to a quarrel or jealousy&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; or her own arrogance.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; Her lover is usually depicted leaving her apartment disheartened, while she too becomes heartsick and repentant without him.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; In other portrayals, she is depicted refusing the advances of her lover or refusing a wine cup from him. In Gita Govinda, Radha is also portrayed as Kalahantarita in an instance.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;
{{clear}}

===Khandita===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Khandita Nayika.jpg|thumb|upright|Khandita rebuking her lover.]]

Khandita ("one enraged with her lover")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; is an enraged heroine, whose lover had promised her to spend the night with her, but instead comes to her house the next morning after spending the night with another woman. She is depicted offended, rebuking her lover for his infidelity.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

In the ''Sangitadarpana'', the ragini Varati represents the Khandita Nayika.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Vipralabdha===

Vipralabdha ("one deceived by her lover"),&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; , is a deceived heroine,&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; who waited for her lover the whole night.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; She is depicted throwing away her jewellery as her lover did not keep his promise.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; This happens when a lover meets a Khandita and promises a tryst and breaks his promise.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

The ''Sangitadarpana'' associates Vipralabdha with the ragini Bhupali. However, the ''Ragavibodha'' presents the raginis Varati and Velavati as Vipralabdhas.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Proshitabhartruka===
[[File:Proshita-patika Nayika.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Proshita-patika mourning.]]

Proshitabhartruka ("one with a sojourning husband")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Proshitapatika (as named by Keshavadasa) is the woman whose husband has gone away from her for some business and does not return on the appointed day. She is depicted seated mourning, surrounded by her maids, but refusing to be consoled.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;

The ''Ragavibodha'' describes the raginis Dhanashri and Kamodi as Proshitabhartrukas.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Abhisarika===

Abhisarika ("one who moves")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; is a heroine, who sets aside her modesty and moves out of her home to secretly meet her lover.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; She is depicted at the door of her house and on her way to the tryst, defying all kinds of difficulties like the storm, snakes and dangers of the forest.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; In art, Abhisarika is portrayed often in hurry towards her destination.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

The raginis Bahuli and Saurashtri are described having the traits of the daring Abhisarika.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

'''Beirut''' was a non-profit art institution that was founded in [[Giza]], [[Egypt]] in 2012. It was registered as Goldin + Senneby LLC in [[Cairo]], Egypt. The art space closed in 2015.

==Overview==
Beirut was an art initiative and exhibition space founded by Sarah Rifky and Jens Maier Rothe as a space that considers institution building as a curatorial act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmuseum.org/blog/view/on-instituting-a-new-space-for-thought|title=On Instituting A New Space For Thought|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artterritories.net/?page_id=3202|title=008.01 BEIRUT  {{!}} ArtTerritories|website=www.artterritories.net|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution’s activities were centered around hosting artists, artworks, research projects and other institutions engaging with similar questions of politics, economy, education, ecology and the arts. The art space was established in a late 1940s three-story villa surrounded by a little garden in the neighborhood of [[Agouza]], Giza. Beirut was initiated in the aftermath of the Egyptian uprising, examining the space of art during this insurgent time. It closed in 2015 following tightening security and decreased support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2012/10/30/beirut-in-cairo-the-citys-new-art-space/|title=Beirut in Cairo: the city’s new art space|date=30 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Imaginary School Program==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}} 
tISP was an eight-month cross-disciplinary practice and theory based program initiated by Beirut  in 2014. The program directed by Antonia Alampi, comprised a series of workshops, lectures, field trips and reading groups focused on the notion of instituting and organizing. Participants looked at collectives, non-movements, informal groups and non-governmental civic and cultural organizations in Cairo. tISP was designed in response too surge of new initiatives, collectives and institutions founded in Cairo following the 2011 uprising, taking a critical and investigative look at alternative civic infrastructures.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

'''''Butterflies''''' is a series paintings made by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in 1889 and 1890. Van Gogh made at least four paintings of [[butterfly|butterflies]] and one of a [[moth]].  The metamorphosis of the caterpillar into a butterfly was symbolic to Van Gogh of men and women's capability for transformation.

==Butterflies and moths==
[[Butterfly|Butterflies]] and [[moths]], in the insect order [[Lepidoptera]], are [[Differences between butterflies and moths|distinguished]] generally in several ways:  Butterflies are brighter in color and fly in the day.  Butterfly wings are not linked and fold together when they are in a resting position.  On the other hand, moths are generally duller in color, fly at night and have linked wings.  There are some exceptions, though, such as a few types of colored moths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/What-are-the-differences-between-butterflies-and-moths | title=What are the differences between butterflies and moths? | publisher=Australian Museum | accessdate=2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Butterflies as a subject==
Butterflies are found in art and literature, often as symbols of freedom, transformation and life. Van Gogh used butterflies in his works as a symbol of hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Butterflies of Oklahoma, Kansas, and North Texas | first1=J | last1=Dole | first2=W | last2=Gerard | first3=Nelson | last3=J | publisher=University of Oklahoma Press | location= | year=2004 | page=3 | isbn=0-8061-3554-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJMCX1MpPZAC&amp;pg=PA3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his favorite metaphors was about transformative possibilities.&lt;ref name="Gayford, M 2008 7"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Yellow House: Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Nine Turbulent Weeks in Provence | author=Gayford, M | publisher=Mariner Books | location= | year=2008 |origyear=2006 | page=7| isbn=978-0-618-99058-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QVAevUM7oIC&amp;pg=PA7
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter to his sister Wil, Van Gogh says that like a grub eats salad roots, unknowing of the transformation that will take it to a beetle, we are not aware of our potential for [[metamorphosis]].  Similarly, he as a "painter ought to paint pictures; possibly something else will come after that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and God: A Creative Spiritual Quest | author=Edwards, C | publisher=Loyola Press | location=Chicago | year=1989 | page=112 | isbn=0-8294-0621-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYA9QzwvsekC&amp;pg=PA112
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of prostitutes, such as those he met at brothels, Van Gogh wondered of any woman who fell into a life of degradation: "She is seeking, seeking, seeking -- does she herself know what?  Might she be transformed one day like a grub into a butterfly?"&lt;ref name="Gayford, M 2008 7"/&gt;  That hope may have been on Van Gogh's mind when he took in pregnant [[Sien (Van Gogh series)|Sien Hoornik]], a prostitute, and her daughter when he lived in The Hague in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Table: At the Auberge Ravoux | first1=A | last1=Leaf | first2=F | last2=Lebain | publisher=Artisan | location=New York | year=2001 | pages=11–12| isbn= 9781579653156| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBxJtWUz-CoC&amp;pg=PA11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to his friend [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]], Van Gogh uses the miracle of transformation from caterpillar to butterfly to consider what possibilities may be available in the universe:
"However, since nothing confutes the assumption that lines and forms and colours exist on innumerable other planets and suns as well, we are at liberty to feel fairly serene about the possibilities of painting in a better and different existence, an existence altered by a phenomenon that is perhaps no more ingenious and no more surprising than the transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly or of a grub into a maybug. The existence of a painter-butterfly would be played out on the countless celestial bodies which, after death, should be no more inaccessible to us than the black dots on maps that symbolize towns and villages are in our earthly lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/B08.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh.

When in need of solace, nature is where Van Gogh went to find peace.  In a letter to his sister Wilhelmina he writes that he finds to calm down it's best to "look at a blade of grass, the branch of a fir tree, an ear of wheat. So if you want to do, as the artists do, go look at the red and white poppies with their bluish leaves, their buds soaring on gracefully bent stems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/W13.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh.

==Paintings made in Arles==
Van Gogh came to [[Arles]] in [[southern France]] when he was about 35 years of age. There he began producing some of his best work.   The [[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|sunflower paintings]], some of the most recognizable of Van Gogh's paintings, were created in this time.  This is likely one of Van Gogh's happier periods of life.  He is confident, clear-minded and seemingly content.&lt;ref name="Morton"/&gt;  In a letter to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], he wrote, "Painting as it is now, promises to become more subtle - more like music and less like sculpture - and above all, it promises color." As a means of explanation, Van Gogh explains that being like music means being comforting.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Arts Entwined: Music and Painting in the Nineteenth Century | first1=M | last1=Morton | first2=P | last2=Schmunk | publisher=Garland Publishing | location=New York | year=2000 | pages=177–178 | isbn=0-8153-3156-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7NP724mFE1MC&amp;pg=PA177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Grass and Butterflies''===
''Grass and Butterflies,'' made in Arles, is part of a private collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/174/Grass-and-Butterflies.html |title=Grass and Butterflies |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===''Two White Butterflies''===
Fascinated by butterflies at a young age, [[Vincent Dethier]] became an [[entomologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Biographical Memoirs |first1=A | last1=Gelperin | first2=J | last2=Hildebrand | first3=T | last3=Eisner | volume=89 | publisher=National Academy of Sciences (U.S.) | location=Washington, D.C. | year=2006 | pages=4, 8| url=http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/vdethier.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In tribute to him on his seventieth birthday, [[Miriam Rothschild]] expressed her appreciation metaphorically through Van Gogh's painting:  "Two white butterflies twirling in freedom and winged delight.  For me they are the symbol of daydreaming — the poetry that Vince Dethier insinuates so cunningly into our factual information and knowledge.  For the gift, of these special white butterflies — along with all your official and unofficial students, past, present and future — Vince Dethier, I tender you my most heartfelt and grateful thanks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Biographical Memoirs |author=National Academy of Sciences | volume=89 | publisher=National Academy of Sciences (U.S.) | location=Washington, D.C. | year=2007 | page=91 | isbn=978-0-309-11372-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjmCN46fHb0C&amp;pg=PA91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretation of ''Two White Butterflies'' describes fragile white butterflies that fly over a field of turning grass, evoking a sense of foreboding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Art, crime, and madness: Gesualdo, Caravaggio, Genet, Van Gogh, Artaud | author=Shoham, S | publisher=Sussex Academic Press | location=Brighton, England | year=2002 | page=150 | isbn=1-903900-05-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7F8eSRKBFMC&amp;pg=PA150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groupings of butterfly and garden paintings===
Jennifer Helvey, author of ''Irises: Vincent van Gogh in the Garden'', groups five garden paintings that Van Gogh made in Arles due to stylist similarity. This grouping includes two butterfly paintings: ''Two White Butterflies'' and ''Grass and Butterflies.'' She found the paintings seem true, natural reflections of gardens, with a top-down perspective. The works in the grouping share a similar color palette and rhythmic brushstrokes. ''Iris'' appears, though, to have been subject to greater study: the single plant centered and the brushstrokes of the grass radiating out from the iris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Irises: Vincent van Gogh in the garden | author=Helvey, J | publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum | location=Los Angeles | year=2009 | page=50 | isbn=978-0-89236-226-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUZ-dHerY3sC&amp;pg=PA46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Paintings made in Saint-Rémy==
For one year, from May 1889 to May 1890, Van Gogh was voluntarily admitted at the asylum at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]], which is near Arles. During that time he was often restricted to working within the asylum's grounds.&lt;ref name="NGL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/vincent-van-gogh-long-grass-with-butterflies |title=Long Grass with Butterflies

Within the grounds of the asylum he painted ivy covered trees, lilacs, and irises of the garden.&lt;ref name="Met Article"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VGM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=12267&amp;lang=en |title=The Therapy of Painting | author= | date= | work= | publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=March 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Green Peacock Moth''===
In May 1889 Van Gogh began work on ''Green Peacock Moth'' which he self-titled ''Death's Head Moth.'' The moth, called death's head, is a rarely seen nocturnal moth.  He described the large moth's colors "of amazing distinction, black, grey, cloudy white tinged with carmine or vaguely shading off into olive green."&lt;ref name="Harrison-DHM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/592.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh.

Although composed of natural motifs, Van Gogh's layering of pattern in Butterflies and Poppies suggests a decorative quality like that of a textile or a screen."  Mancoff compared this study to the Japanese prints he admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/artwork/vincent-van-gogh-final-paintings6.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh Final Paintings |author=Mancoff, D |year=2006–2011 |work=HowStuffWorks |publisher=Publications International, Ltd. |accessdate=2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Existential Butterfly'', a book of poetry about butterflies and nature, Curtis Farmwald wrote of van Gogh's ''Poppies and Butterflies'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Existential Butterfly | author=Farmwald, C | publisher=Trafford Publishing | location=Victoria, B.C. | year=2002 | page=24 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcd3Fd6MWIUC&amp;pg=PA24 | isbn=9781553696551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Though it was painted
:Years ago in another country
:By the troubled Vincent van Gogh,
:The painting could have been done
:Right here sometime this summer.
:I’ve seen red poppies like those
:Growing wild just down the road.
:Yellow sulphurs like those
:Are all over my yard.
:Can their beauty still inspire
:A troubled soul to survive?"

Indicating his desire to make the painting, in 1888 Van Gogh mentions hoping to make a better version of butterflies or the field of poppies while in Arles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/471.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh.

'''''Cartas Chilenas''''' (in {{lang-en|Chilean Letters}}) is an [[unfinished creative work|unfinished]] series of satirical poems whose authorship is attributed to [[Portuguese Brazilian|Luso-Brazilian]] [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassic]] poet [[Tomás António Gonzaga]]. The poems circulated in the city of [[Ouro Preto|Vila Rica]] (present-day Ouro Preto) via pamphlets for several years before the [[Inconfidência Mineira|1789 Minas Conspiracy]], but were discontinued after the Conspiracy was dismantled, as Gonzaga was sent to exile in the [[Island of Mozambique]]. It is said that the ''Cartas Chilenas'' were loosely based on and inspired by [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Persian Letters]]''.

The poems were compiled for the first time and published in 1863. They were re-edited several times after that, reaching their present form in 1957 thanks to the extensive research of Portuguese philologist [[Manuel Rodrigues Lapa]].

==Plot and setting==
''Cartas Chilenas'' is a satirical poem in the shape of an [[epistolary novel]], indirectly written "in honor" of Luís da Cunha Meneses, then-governor of the [[Minas Gerais|Captaincy of Minas Gerais]], and the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese Crown]]. It begins with a fictional foreword, in which an anonymous Brazilian man explains how the book came into being: he obtained a copy of a series of letters from a man coming to Brazil from an unnamed [[Hispanic America]] country, and decided to translate these letters from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] in order to keep the Brazilian governors from making the same mistakes made by Fanfarrão Minésio, the tyrannic governor of Chile.

The thirteen letters were written as [[blank verse]] poems by "Critilo" (the assumed ''nom de plume'' of [[Tomás António Gonzaga]]), who lives in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]] (actually [[Ouro Preto|Vila Rica]], [[Minas Gerais]]), and are addressed to his friend, "Doroteu" (possibly [[Cláudio Manuel da Costa]]), who lives in [[Madrid]]. In each letter, "Critilo" describes life in Santiago under the despotic and corruption-filled régime of the Chilean governor, "Fanfarrão Minésio" (who is actually Luís da Cunha Meneses).

'''Dansaekhwa''' ({{lang-ko|단색화}}), also known as "Tansaekhwa" refers to a loose grouping of paintings that emerged in Korean painting starting in the mid-1970s, when a group of artists began to push paint, soak canvas, drag pencils, rip paper, and otherwise manipulate the materials of painting. Tansaekhwa means ‘monochrome painting’ in Korean and was used by the critic Lee Yil in 1980 to refer to a group of largely non-figurative paintings painted in neutral hues.  Promoted in Seoul, Tokyo, and Paris, Tansaekhwa grew to be the international face of contemporary Korean art and a cornerstone of contemporary Asian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kee|first1=Joan|title=Contemporary Korean Art: Tansaekhwa and the Urgency of Method|date=2013|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=0966350391|pages=384|edition=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 May 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures associated with Tansaekhwa include: [[Cho Yong-ik]], Chung Chang-Sup, [[Chung Sanghwa|Chung Sang-Hwa]], Ha Chonghyun, Heu Hwang, Kim Guiline, Kwon Young-woo, [[Lee Dong-youb|Lee 
Dong Youb]], [[Lee Ufan]], [[Park Seo-bo|Park Seobo]], Suh Seung-Wong, and Yun Hyong-keun.

==History==
Lee Ufan had moved to Japan in 1956, where he established himself with the Mono-ha movement in the late 1960s. In the mid-1970s he introduced his Korean peers to the Tokyo art scene. “Five Korean Artists, Five Kinds of White,” a group show held at Tokyo Gallery in May 1975, is often credited as the first major presentation of the works that later became known as Tansaekhwa. The five featured artists were Kwon Young-woo, Lee Dong Youb, Heu Hwang, Suh Seung-won and Park Seobo.

==Recent attention==
In 2013, the first extended scholarly discussion of Tansaekhwa, written by Joan Kee, was published by the University of Minnesota Press. It was a finalist for the annual College Art Association Charles Rufus Morey Prize for the most distinguished book in the history of art, the first book on any aspect of modern and contemporary Asian art to receive this designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/moreyfinalists# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322211016/http://www.collegeart.org/awards/moreyfinalists# |archive-date=2016-03-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jenny Jungsil|title=Contemporary Korean Art: Tansaekhwa and the Urgency of Method|journal=Journal of Korean Studies|date=2014|volume=38|pages=157–160|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/594914|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2014, a spate of survey shows in Korea and the United States triggered renewed critical and commercial interest in Dansaekhwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Degen|first1=Natasha|last2= Kim|first2=Kibum|year= 2015|title=The Koreans at the Top of the Art World |website=New Yorker |url= http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-koreans-at-the-top-of-the-art-world |access-date= 2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Everworld''''' is a fantasy novel series written by [[K. A. Applegate]] and published by [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic]] between 1999 and 2001. It consists of twelve books and a companion music CD titled ''The Everworld Experience''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Ever-World-Experience/release/4836367|title=Various - The Ever World Experience|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main characters==
* '''David Levin''': The self-appointed leader of the protagonists. David takes on all the burdens of the group, and has been troubled by his past in which he was cowardly; he must prove himself to be a man.  Before being sucked into Everworld, he was involved in a romantic relationship with Senna Wales.  As such, he is most susceptible to the influence of Senna's powers. He shows his courage and bravery before [[Zeus]], other gods, and Vikings. David fights with the Sword of [[Galahad]], after witnessing Sir Galahad's death.  At the end of the series, he opts to stay in Everworld to help protect it, as well as to escape his mother's smoking and depression problems.  David narrates ''#1: Search for Senna'', ''#5: Discover the Destroyer'', and ''#10: Understand the Unknown''.
* '''Christopher Hitchcock''': The reluctant clown of the group, Christopher often makes jokes specifically targeted towards the other members of the group (April ([[sexism]]), Jalil ([[racism]]), and David ([[antisemitism]])).  He does this to keep the others at a distance, so they won't get to know him. Christopher is, in his own words, on the road to becoming an [[alcoholic]] like his parents. However, he can be a jerk one minute, and a kind, caring person the next. Christopher gave up the offer to become an immortal because he failed to save the life of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], Zeus' male lover; blaming his failure on latent homophobia causes Christopher to fall into an alcoholic depression and is the turning point for his character. Christopher also decreases in his prejudice jokes when Keith, who is part of a group of racists and anti-Semitics that plan to overthrow the government, tries to recruit him.  At the end of the series, he opts to stay in Everworld to avoid his parents' alcoholic nature, escape his younger brother's ridicule and abuse, and stay off the road to a possible alcoholic future.  Christopher narrates ''#2: Land of Loss'', ''#6: Fear the Fantastic'', and ''#11: Mystify the Magician''.
* '''April O'Brien''': The heroine of the group, April is Senna's half-sister; their personalities, however, are directly opposite, and the two hate each other with a passion. April is a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], somewhat [[feminism|feminist]], and very beautiful with red hair and green eyes. She is in the [[drama]] [[Club (organization)|club]] at her real world school, and she is often singing songs from ''Rent''. She is also said to be very popular at the main characters' high school.  April carries her own burdens in the group, and is often the voice of reason next to Jalil. She is a vegetarian.  She has the most reason to want to return to the Old World at the end of the series, due to how much she could possibly leave behind.  Ultimately, however, she opts to remain in Everworld due to her unbearable guilt and inability to face her father over her murder of Senna, knowing that it would never be acceptable in their home world, no matter how necessary it had been in Everworld.  April narrates ''#3: Enter the Enchanted'', ''#7: Gateway to the Gods'', and ''#12: Entertain the End''.
* '''Jalil Sherman''': The scientist and sole African-American of the group, he wants to find the "[[software]]" on which Everworld runs and control it. In the real world, Jalil is [[obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive]], but in Everworld, he is unaffected. His disorder is a secret to the rest of the group for a majority of the series. Senna, however, knows of his condition and was able to temporarily cure it while the two were in the Old World, on the condition he would swear to serve her. He refused. Jalil always tries hard to search for a logical explanation for the many illogical phenomena in Everworld. He and April often butt heads when it comes to [[religion]], but the two often fall on the same side in arguments within the group. At the end of the series, he opts to stay in Everworld rather than return home to the Old World because he does not have to live with his disorder.  His name ironically means "godlike."  Jalil narrates ''#4: Realm of the Reaper'' and ''#8: Brave the Betrayal''.
* '''Senna Wales''': The witch who intertwines all the characters. Senna is David's girlfriend, Christopher's ex-girlfriend, and April's half-sister (they have the same father and different mothers) and has blond hair and gray eyes. Senna is the only main character with real magical power, and at times, uses the others for her own ends, whether through [[emotional manipulation]] or magic. Her magical power is much stronger in Everworld than in the Old World. Her name was originally Senda (meaning "gateway" in Spanish), but after her mother left her she began to refer to herself based on her father's mispronunciation. Senna sometimes uses her powers on others for her own benefit, whether for protection or distraction, though usually in an effort to further her own plans.  Senna's ultimate goal is to overthrow the powers of Everworld and rule over it for her own.  She is ultimately foiled in her plan, however, when she is killed by April in the penultimate book.  Senna only narrates ''#9: Inside the Illusion''.

==Recurring characters==
* '''[[Loki]]''': The [[Norsemen|Norse]] god of destruction who brought David, Senna, Christopher, Jalil, and April into Everworld. Loki wants to use Senna as a gateway to the Old World to escape Ka Anor. Loki escaped from his prison when he was brought to Everworld centuries ago and at some point in the recent past overthrew and imprisoned Odin.  He is also the father of [[Hel (being)|Hel]], [[Fenrisulfr|Fenrir]], and the [[Jörmungandr|Midgard Serpent]].
* '''[[Ka Anor]]''': The god-eating deity of the Hetwans who wants to devour all the gods in Everworld before they escape to the Old World. It also is trying to capture Senna, most likely to prevent the other gods from using her to escape.
* '''Thorolf''': A [[Viking]], in whose farm David, Christopher, Jalil, and April spend the night in ''Everworld #1: Search for Senna''. Died and "ascended" to Valhalla in ''Everworld #8: Brave The Betrayal''.
* '''Olaf Ironfoot''': A [[Viking]] king with an iron foot, Olaf fought alongside David, Christopher, and Jalil against the [[Aztecs]]. He engaged [[Huitzilopoctli]] in personal combat wielding [[Mjolnir]], before being sliced in half by the god. He is of African descent, likely due to the Vikings' tendency to intermarry with other peoples.
* '''Sven Swordeater''': A young [[Viking]] who was stabbed through the cheeks, causing a [[speech impediment]]. Sven was also killed by [[Huitzilopoctli]].
* '''Monsieur Jean-Claude LeMieux''': A [[Frenchman]] who is brought to Everworld thanks to a nuclear explosion. He lives in and is the [[mayor]] of the Greek version of [[Atlantis]].
* '''[[Étaín|Etain]]''': An [[Irish people|Irish]] woman, the half-[[elf]] daughter of the Queen of the Elves, whom Christopher falls in love with. Etain seems to have feelings for him too; however, the series ends with the implication that she probably married the dwarf-king Baldwin in exchange for his assistance in the war to save Everworld.
* '''Keith''': A violent and suicidal [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] who worked with Christopher at an independent copy store for a short amount of time.
* '''Anica''': A [[Wicca]]n who fled the Old World when Loki and other forces desiring a gateway began to search for her, taking refuge with the Egyption Pantheon of Everworld. Before leaving she left her illegitimate daughter with the girl's father and his family, the O'Briens. Anica fears Senna's wrath above all else, but at the same time, seeks her forgiveness.  She is last seen pleading for it, but it is unknown as to whether or not she receives it from Senna.
* '''[[Merlin]]''': The famous wizard who, along with Ka Anor and Loki, is trying to capture Senna, though in his case it is merely to keep anyone from using her, and likely to prevent her takeover of Everworld. Senna fears him the most, and refers to him as the most powerful being in Everworld, because while he lacks the power of the average god, his cleverness and imagination give him an edge. His ultimate goal is to bring all the deities and people of Everworld together to stop Ka Anor.

==People==

===Old-Worlders===
The Old-Worlders are people who do not live in Everworld and who live
in the old world.

===Gods===
Many gods were in the Everworld series.  Nearly all the gods shared similar characteristics such as shape shifting, physical perfection, superhuman strength and immortality. They could only be killed by the weapon of another god such as Thor's hammer Mjolnir or through severe injury. Even then, there is a chance they could heal. Real world weapons however do seem to harm gods. When the Sennites arrived with automatic weapons, they apparently killed Fenrir. Many of the gods had special powers related to their field and some were radically more powerful than others. Nearly all of them were portrayed as being cold and cruel in their attitude toward humans if not outright insane due to their power and long lives and would rather carry on their petty squabbles from ancient times. Most are slow to change or act unless they feel immediately threatened allowing the threat of the Hetwan to grow. The gods in Everworld included:

''This list is not complete''

===Vikings===
The Vikings are very similar to their real world counterparts, but in many ways are easier to relate to than other groups of people. A mixture of farmers, craftsmen and warriors that glorify battle, but are trustworthy allies.  Among the peoples of Everworld they are easy to get along with and motivate into needed action instead of bickering amongst themselves. They are also the most cosmopolitan of Everworld humans, as they readily accept people of other races into their ranks (African, Asian, etc.) They worshiped Loki for an unknown period of time when he overthrew Odin and other major gods such as Thor and Balder disappeared.

===Aztecs===
The [[Aztecs]], in their ''Everworld'' incarnation, are portrayed as an utterly savage and barbaric society. They are first encountered at the end of the first book, ''Search for Senna''. The [[Aztecs]] are known by many names in Everworld, including "The Blood-Drinkers," "The Mexica," and "The Heart Eaters." Some groups worship [[Huitzilopoctli]], while others worship [[Quetzalcoatl]].

===Coo-Hatch===
The Coo-Hatch are strange creatures from an alien world who abandoned their gods after their God of the Flame and Goddess of the Ore brought them to Everworld against their will. A majority of the Coo-Hatch seem to be disillusioned by their deities and Everworld and want to go back to their realm. They often ally themselves with whomever they believe can achieve this goal. They have large red eyes with blue pupils, two main arms as well as two smaller arms that have more dexterity and are on the sides of their faces. Their mouths are long and tapered. Juvenile Coo-Hatch are small and flighted with needle-like mouths. The juveniles are very fast fliers, covering a space of 20 feet in the length of a human blink.

The Coo-Hatch are also master metal forgers and can create blades sharp enough to cut through any known material; they use this skill to make small, accurate throwing blades and metal tools. In exchange of April's chemistry book, the Coo-Hatch improve Jalil's pocket knife to their quality of metal, giving them a small blade that can cut through anything, the group dubbing it "Excalibur". The Coo-Hatch had no knowledge of guns or explosives prior to the exchange. The Coo-Hatch used the textbook to develop primitive cannons. The Coo-Hatch then aided the Hetwans in almost taking over Mt. Olympus. Later, some of the tribes of the Coo-Hatch team up with the protagonists and develop cannons to use in an assault on the Hetwans (which supposedly takes place after the series end).

Their one true desire is to go back to their forges on their home world, which they cannot do without a gateway like Senna or her mother. Though this plot was not built upon later in the series, Senna's mother was sought out to send them back to their world.

===Hetwan===
The Hetwan are large, sentient insectoid aliens that seem to exist as a collective hive rather than as a group of individuals. Male Hetwan consist of two arms, a pair of wings, fly-like eyes, and three constantly moving claws near their mouths. The claws are used to grasp a tube that is then used to project the Hetwan's [[acidic]] [[saliva]]. They continue moving at a slower pace after death. Female Hetwan are flying translucent sacks of organs. They travel in packs, where, upon encountering male Hetwan, they are savagely torn apart, thus birthing perhaps a dozen Hetwan on the waist of the male.

The Hetwan worship [[Ka Anor]], the dread god of terror, and serve his will to devour all the gods in Everworld. Though aliens, the Hetwan have no high-tech weaponry. They do, however, wield devices similar to long straws (nicknamed "Super-Soakers" by the main characters), out of which they shoot a burning, venomous acid.  The Hetwan themselves seem to feel no fear of death or anything.  As repeatedly stated by them they exist merely to serve Ka Anor and are absolutely loyal to him.

The Hetwan live in a great city that resembles a giant needle sticking out of a pit (referred to by Chris as "Junkie Dreamland"), with an assortment of strange creatures from their home world.

The main characters often fight against the Hetwan. Because Ka Anor intends to eventually kill and consume all of Everworld's gods, most of the peoples of Everworld would be considered enemies of the Hetwan, although they generally seek to appease them out of fear of destruction.

Little is known about the Hetwans' life before Everworld, but like all alien species (those not from [[human]] [[mythology]]), they were brought there from another world (not "our" world) by their particular deity, the dread-god Ka Anor. They then began to conquer everything they came across, while collecting [[deity|gods]] for their deity to consume. The Hetwan kingdom in Everworld alternates between perfectly hemispherical hills and gullies, giving a scooped-out appearance. The alien trees make strange musical sounds.  The Hetwan capital, where Ka Anor resides, is a massive tower (dubbed "Junkie Dream Mountain" for its needle-like appearance) in the middle of a lava and glass filled crater.  The only transportation across this gulf is by means of the "Red Wings", giant insects that can carry passengers.

===Knights===
The knights are classic men of [[chivalry]]. Self-described as "creatures of myth and legend", their main pastimes seem to be slaying [[dragons]], rescuing young girls, and feasting. Despite witnessing April taking out several [[trolls]], the knights still believe that women should act "womanly"—no fighting, allowing themselves to be looked over and pampered. They are very brave and value honor highly. The knights met in the series were all surviving members of the Knights of the Round Table such as [[Galahad]].  While they had not aged since entering Everworld they lack the immortality of many other beings.  Merlin is often allied with these beings.

===Eunuchs===
The [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] in Everworld are male warriors with big, muscular bodies but with high-pitched voices; this is because they were [[castration|castrated]] before they reached [[puberty]].

The symbol on their breastplates is a bloody dagger with two red diamonds. They always say "jewels" when referring to [[testicles]]. The eunuchs guard the City of [[Hel (being)|Hel]] (known only as "Her City"), kidnapping men to inhabit it as Hel's personal harem. (Why Hel's harem requires eunuchs is never explained, but perhaps indicates that her powers over or interest in castrated males is reduced or nonexistent.)

===Fairies===
The fairies share some characteristics with the wood [[nymphs]]. Like nymphs, they are about four feet tall and rather thin. Fairies can move quickly when necessary, though not as quickly as nymphs can. Unlike the fairies commonly portrayed, they do not have wings. Their typical attire is a leather [[tunic]] and a tight [[helmet]], and their main weapons are [[arrow]]s and [[sword]]s. Different colored tunics signify different jobs within Fairy Land; for example, a fairy wearing a dark blue tunic is part of the fairy version of the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] and goes around making notes on the various stands within the city, while a fairy in a black tunic is part of the police force.

Fairies in Everworld, also called "[[leprechauns]]", are known for their cupidity---Fairy Land, which is very pristine and clean compared to other parts of Everworld, serves as a kind of economic center for the entire world. It has a King and Queen; though it is unclear who has official power, the Queen is portrayed as the brains of the two.

===Greeks===
In the books, the [[Greeks]] are battling the [[Hetwan]] to keep [[Ka Anor]] from conquering [[Mount Olympus]].  They live in the land surrounding the Everworld equivalent of Mt. Olympus.  They worship [[Zeus]] along with the other Olympian gods such as, [[Ares]], [[Hera]], and [[Athena]].  Among the gods of Everworld, Olympus is implied to be one of the most powerful places due to the large number of gods living there. Athena is one of the few gods who not only acts in a sane manner, but also aides the protagonists in their quest.

===Egyptians===
The [[Egyptians]] are a reactionary race living along the [[Nile]]. Due to centuries of ritual and inbreeding the Egyptian culture became weak. The [[Amazons]], led by Pretty Little Flower used this to their advantage and proceeded to subjugate and loot Egypt. This ended when the crocodile god [[Sobek]] freed the capital and killed Pretty Little Flower, becoming Lord of all Egypt. The rest of the Egyptian gods had become living statues due to their long lives and dedication to ritual.

===Dwarves===
[[norse dwarves|Dwarves]] are a mountain dwelling race. Dwarves stand about four feet tall with extremely stocky builds. Most dwarves have long hair and beards. They are generally seen with chainmail and some sort of weapon. While most dwarves seen are men, often women are mistaken for men, due to their masculine appearance. They are skilled in both mining and blacksmithing.

The dwarves are led by King Baldwin, who resides in his capital of Daggermouth. Beneath Daggermouth is a mining complex known as the Five Hills, each of which produce a different kind of metal. They are known to have close relations to the [[Vikings]], as is evidenced by their metalwork in Viking ships, as well as their reverence for [[Thor]] and [[Baldur]].

===Mermaids===
Mermaids are ruled by [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]. In the book, there are Mermen as well. The Mermen act as guards and are part of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]'s army. The Mermaids swim around topless, and much to Christopher's delight, their hair rarely manages to cover their nudity.  They live underwater in the Roman version of Atlantis.

===Atlanteans===
A technologically advanced race living under the Everworld's ocean. They are led by Jean-Claude LeMieux, who serves as mayor of the city.  There is Roman and a Greek version of the city.

===Irish===
In the books, the [[Irish people|Irish]] have embraced [[technology]] faster than any other people; in one of their cities, they have [[electricity]] and [[cable cars]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}. This is believed to come to some degree from the telegraph that the main characters brought to Everworld, but also from the goddess Brigid. Their knowledge also may have come from the [[Druids]], who are ordered by colors; the "yellow" druids being those in the study of electricity and technology. The lands of the [[Irish people|Irish]] are protected by the Fiannans, a special order of knights.  They are ruled by a number of kings who are ruled by a high king.  Merlin is closely allied with them and they attribute his wisdom to maintaining peace in their land for over two hundred years.

===Sennites===
The Sennites are a group of [[white supremacy|white supremacists]] Senna brought over from the real world. With modern weapons, they are a force to be reckoned with. At the beginning of the final book, ''Entertain the End'', with Senna dead, David and the others wonder if the Sennites might forge an alliance with [[Ka Anor]]; this forces the four to make a deal with the gods in order to stem the threat.

'''Evgenia Petrovna Antipova''' ({{lang-ru|Евге́ния Петро́вна Анти́пова}}; October 19, 1917 in [[Toropets]], [[Tver Governorate]], [[Russian Republic|Russia]] – January 27, 2009 in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]) was a Russian Soviet painter, watercolorist, graphic artist, and Art teacher, a member of the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists]] (before 1992 the Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation),&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of members of the Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation.'' Leningrad, Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1987. P.7.&lt;/ref&gt; lived and worked in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad – Saint Petersburg]] and regarded as one of representatives of the [[Leningrad School of Painting]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. P.9, 15, 20, 21, 24, 356, 388–397, 399, 400, 403–407, 439, 442, 445.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
'''Evgenia Petrovna Antipova''' was born on October 19, 1917 in [[Toropets]] town, [[Tver Governorate]]. Her father was a railway office worker. Since 1928 she lived with her parents in Samara on the Volga River. There she began to get busy in an artistic studio under the direction of Pavel Krasnov. From 1935, Antipova lived in Leningrad. In 1936–1939 she studied in the [[Leningrad Secondary Art School]] at the [[Russian Academy of Arts|All-Russian Academy of Arts]]. Her teachers were Leonid Ovsyannikov, [[Alexander Zaytsev (artist)|Alexander Zaytsev]], Leonid Sholokhov, Alexander Debler, [[Vladimir Gorb]].

In 1939 Antipova entered the painting department of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts|Repin Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (since 1944 named after Ilia Repin)]], where she studied with [[Semion Abugov]], [[Genrikh Pavlovsky]], [[Alexander Osmerkin]], [[Gleb Savinov]], and Vladimir Malagis.&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School''. Saint Petersburg, NP-Print Edition, 2007. P.356.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 Antipova at first participated in the All-Union Youth Artistic Exhibition in Moscow, presenting the sketch of work «Valery Chkalov among young people». It was printed in a magazine called the «Young Artist» for 1939.

The start of [[Operation Barbarossa]] found Antipova on summer practice in the West Ukraine. With the last echelons she reached Leningrad. On July 28, 1941 Antipova made a match for Jacov Lukash, a fourth-year student of the department of monumental painting. Called up to serve in the [[Red Army]], he perished at the front in May 1942. Up to the beginning of 1942, Antipova remained in blockaded Leningrad. In February 1942, she was evacuated to Novosibirsk, where she lived and worked up to the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socrealizm.com.ua/gallery/artist/antipova-ep-1917|title=Ленинградский художник Антипова Евгения Петровна (artist Antipova Evgeniya Petrovna)|last=|first=|date=|website=Socialist Realism. Kiev club of collectors.|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 she returned to Leningrad and in 1950 graduated from the [[Repin Institute of Arts]] in [[Boris Ioganson]]'s personal art studio (the former studio of [[Alexander Osmerkin]]). Her graduate work was a painting named «Andrey Zhdanov visits the Palace of Young Pioneers in Leningrad».&lt;ref&gt;''Anniversary Directory graduates of Saint Petersburg State Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, Russian Academy of Arts. 1915–2005''. Saint Petersburg, Pervotsvet Publishing House, 2007. P.61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950–1956 Antipova taught painting and composition in [[Tavricheskaya Art School]] in Leningrad. Since 1950 she participated in art exhibitions. In 1953 she was accepted in the members of [[Leningrad Union of Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of members of the Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation''. Leningrad, Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1987. P.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Antipova painted genre and decorative compositions, portraits, landscapes, still life paintings, worked in oils and watercolours. Among her favorite themes and motives were a blossoming apple orchard, a Crimean landscape, a still life in the interior and in the exterior. Among the known paintings of 1950th and beginning of 1960th «Practical exercises»&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Весенняя выставка произведений ленинградских художников 1954 года|''Весенняя выставка произведений ленинградских художников 1954 года'']].

C.8.&lt;/ref&gt; (1964), and others. They give an idea of range of possibilities and direction of creative searches of artist. Antipova gravitated to expression of her individual attitude in themes, not applying on the exhaustive scope of the phenomenas of the life.

In 1960th Antipova tries itself in the series of portraits. Most considerable it is been «A Girl from Pereslavl» and «Waitress» (both 1964). From the end of 1960th leading genres in creation of Antipova were still life in an interior and exterior, and also landscape. The prevailing style of painting is distinguished by several conventional drawing and composition, the interest for the transmission of color and light and air. Among the most known works of this period «City courtyard in Gavan»,&lt;ref&gt;''Петербург — Петроград — Ленинград в произведениях русских и советских художников. Каталог выставки''.

Каталог.'' Л., Художник РСФСР, 1990. C.47.&lt;/ref&gt; (1989), «Blooming Little Apple-tree» (1997), and others. In the still lifes, Antipova increasingly prefer the open composition, placing a table with a bouquet of flowers, or a book in a corner of the garden, among the branches of a blossoming apple or cherry. Her best works of this genre – «A Midday» (1982), «Still Life. Flowering willow, Calla lilies, Daffodils»&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' Saint Petersburg, NP-Print Edition, 2007. P.146.&lt;/ref&gt; (1984) – are seen as images of the perfect world in which man finds harmony with nature and in his soul. This is the main theme of her art she continued until her death.

'''Eyebeam''' is a not-for-profit art and technology center in New York City, founded by John S. Johnson III with co-founders David S. Johnson and Roderic R. Richardson.

Originally conceived as a digital effects and coding [[atelier]] and center for youth education, Eyebeam has become a center for the research, development, and curation of [[new media]] works of art and [[open source technology]]. Eyebeam annually hosts up to 20 residents and co-produces youth educational programs, exhibitions, performances, symposia, workshops, [[hackathon]]s and other events with these residents as well as with partner organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyebeam.org/about |title=About |author=Eyebeam Art + Technology Center |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects developed at Eyebeam have received awards and recognition including [[Webby Awards]], [[Guggenheim Fellowships]], and the [[Prix Ars Electronica]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==History==
Eyebeam, originally called Eyebeam Atelier, was first conceived as a collaboration between David S. Johnson, a digital artist, and John S. Johnson III, a filmmaker and philanthropist.  The two were introduced by Roderic R. Richardson, a mutual friend who recognized their shared interests and helped establish the new venture in its early stages.  The inspiration to name the project Eyebeam Atelier came partly from the sculpture atelier of John Johnson's father, [[John Seward Johnson II]] and the [[Experiments in Art and Technology]] collective.  After observing [[new media]] as a growing genre, the co-founders were motivated to create a similar studio. They recognized a need to provide artists and digital film artists access to new technology and a shared workspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jana |first1=Reena |year=2002 |title=Johnson and Johnson Heir Founds Digital Art Museum |journal=Carrindex Gabrius }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to offering resources for new media artists, Johnson saw a need to provide middle and high school students with educational and artistic opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An Elegant Marriage of Inside and Outside |author=Herbert Muschamp |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/21/arts/design/21MUSC.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 21, 2001 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital Day Camp, the first youth program which catered to new [[media literacy|media education]], was founded in 1998; in the pilot program, New York-based high school students learned web development and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lopez |first1=Allan |year=1998 |title=Eyebeam Atelier |journal=TheBlowUp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Future sessions included project-based learning around themes of [[bioart]], [[Urban Interventionism|urban interventionism]], [[game design]], and [[wearable technology]].

Eyebeam’s first forum, “Interaction,” took place online in the summer of 1998 and was curated by [[UCSD]] professor Jordan Crandall. The forum, an [[email list]] called &lt;eyebeam&gt;&lt;blast&gt;, was hosted by [[Brian Holmes]], [[Olu Oguibe]], and [[Gregory Ulmer]], and included [[Lev Manovich]], [[N. Katherine Hayles]], [[Saskia Sassen]], [[Matthew Slotover]], [[Ken Goldberg]], [[Geert Lovink]], [[Knowbotic Research]], [[Hans-Ulrich Obrist]], [[Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger]], [[Mark Tribe]], and [[Critical Art Ensemble]] among the participating  artists, educators, new media and internet theorists, and technologists (cite). The discussions spurred by &lt;eyebeam&gt;&lt;blast&gt; were compiled into a book titled “Interaction: Artistic Practice on the Network” and published in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flagan |first1=Are |year=2001 |title=Interaction – Artistic Practice in the Network – Review |journal=Afterimage |issue=July/August }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to funding artistic research, Johnson hoped to develop Eyebeam as a space that would also function as a museum devoted to new media works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An Avant-Garde Design For A New Media Center |author=Julie V. Iovine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/21/arts/an-avant-garde-design-for-a-new-media-center.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 21, 2002 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Eyebeam announced an international architectural competition to construct a space devoted to the dialog between art and technology, with the design firm [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro|Diller + Scofidio]]’s “Olympic class” design named the winner of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pratt |first=Kevin |title= Building the Better Mousetrap |pages=Issue No. 315 |publisher=Time Out New York |date= October 1, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyebeam held its first [[open studio]]s for artists in residence and fellows in 2002. [[Alexander R. Galloway]], [[G. H. Hovagimyan]], [[Tony Martin (artist)|Tony Martin]], [[Yael Kanarek]], [[M.River &amp; T.Whid Art Associates|MTAA]], [[John Klima (artist)|John Klima]], [[Jem Cohen]], [[Cory Arcangel]], and [[Michael Bell-Smith]] were among the inaugural exhibitors.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Among the projects on display was Galloway’s Carnivore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://r-s-g.org/carnivore/|title=Carnivore|work=r-s-g.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]] library that allowed for the creative misuse of data surveillance created in tandem with other members of Radical Software Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eai.org/artistTitles.htm?id=8785/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rojas |first1=Pete |year=2003 |title=Digital Details: Internet Surveillance Tools Make For Unlikely Inspiration |journal=Surface |issue=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnivore takes its name and function from [[Carnivore (software)|DCS1000]], a surveillance system used by the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]].

During their R&amp;D Fellowships, [[Theo Watson]] and [[Zachary Lieberman]] continued to develop [[openFrameworks]], a C/C++ library originally created at [[Parsons The New School for Design|Parsons]]. Together with [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]], openFrameworks became one of the most popular platforms for [[creative coding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/qa-with-zach-lieberman-founder-of-openframeworks-pt-i |title=Q&amp;A With Zachary Lieberman, Founder of openFrameworks (pt.1) |author=Julia Kaganskiy |date=August 3, 2010 |work=The Creators Project |publisher=VICE Media |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eyebeam OpenLab served as the birthplace of the [[Graffiti Research Lab]]. Founded by [[James Powderly]] and [[Evan Roth]] during their OpenLab fellowships in 2005, the GRL was envisioned as a nonprofit design studio for creating experimental technologies with street art applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Writing's on the Wall.

(Free Art and Technology) Lab]], a collective dedicated to the merging of [[open source]] technology and [[popular culture]], with [[Theo Watson]], Chris Sugrue, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/net-art-powerhouse-fat-lab-featured-on-pbs-arts-video |title=Net Art Powerhouse F.A.T.

Eyebeam expanded its programmatic lineup of exhibitions and workshops with MIXER, a series dedicated to showcasing leading performance artists in the field of live video and audio, in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spare Times |author=Melena Ryzik |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/arts/16wspare.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=November 16, 2007 |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural event, “Brother Islands (Places to Lose People),” was focused around an immersive experimental documentary of [[North Brother Island, East River|North Brother Island]] and [[Wards Island]] by media artist [[Benton C Bainbridge]]. MIXER events were organized around themes as disparate as the World's Fair, the 2010 Winter Olympics, and New York City’s underground and featured interactive installations alongside performances by musicians and performance artists including [[Dam Funk|DāM-FunK]], [[Paper Rad|Extreme Animals]], [[CHERYL]], and [[D-Fuse AV]]. That same year, fellows and resident artists began organizing mobile workshops and talks. 
In 2011, several Eyebeam residents, fellows, and alumni participated in [[Talk to Me (exhibition)|''Talk to Me: Design and the Communication between People and Objects'']] at the [[MoMA|Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. Eyebeam Fellow Ayah Bdeir’s littleBits, a DIY kit of open source pre-assembled circuits, was among the projects displayed and was acquired by the MoMA as part of their permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=145485 |title=MoMA – The Collection – Ayah Bdeir. littleBits. 2008. |date= |work=The Museum of Modern Art |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014 the first ever [[Wikipedia:Meetup/ArtAndFeminism|Art + Feminism Wikipedia Edit-A-Thon]] was hosted at Eyebeam and co-organized by fellow [[Laurel Ptak]] in conjunction with more than 30 satellite edit-a-thons internationally across the United States, Canada, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

In July 2014 Eyebeam left their Chelsea space and now operates out of an interim space in [[Industry City]] in [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn]].

Since November 2017 Eyebeam has been located at 199 Cook Street in Brooklyn. This coincides with their 20th anniversary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/408850/eyebeam-new-bushwick-home-at-20/|title=As Eyebeam Turns 20, the Arts Nonprofit Moves to Bushwick|date=2017-11-01|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an organization which was celebrated in Spring 2018.

{{Fantasy}}
{{Speculative fiction|cTopic=Fantasy fiction}}
'''Fantasy films''' are films that belong to the [[fantasy]] genre with fantastic themes, usually [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[supernatural]] events, [[mythology]], [[folklore]], or exotic [[fantasy world]]s. The [[Film genre|genre]] is considered a form of [[speculative fiction]] alongside [[science fiction film]]s and [[horror film]]s, although the genres do overlap. Fantasy films often have an element of magic, [[myth]], wonder, escapism, and the extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/fantasyfilms.html Fantasy Films&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgenres==
Several sub-categories of fantasy films can be identified, although the delineations between these subgenres, much as in fantasy literature, are somewhat fluid.

The most common fantasy subgenres depicted in movies are [[High fantasy|High Fantasy]] and [[Sword and sorcery|Sword and Sorcery]].{{according to whom|date=October 2016}} Both categories typically employ quasi-medieval settings, wizards, magical creatures and other elements commonly associated with fantasy stories.

High Fantasy films tend to feature a more richly developed fantasy world, and may also be more character-oriented or thematically complex. Often, they feature a hero of humble origins and a clear distinction between good and evil set against each other in an epic struggle. Many scholars cite [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' novel as the prototypical modern example of High Fantasy in literature, and the recent [[Peter Jackson]] [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|film adaptation]] of the books is a good example of the High Fantasy subgenre on the silver screen.

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Conan the barbarian.jpg|thumb|left|''Conan the Barbarian'' (1982), a typical Sword and Sorcery film]] --&gt;
Sword and Sorcery movies tend to be more plot-driven than high fantasy and focus heavily on action sequences, often pitting a physically powerful but unsophisticated warrior against an evil wizard or other supernaturally endowed enemy.  Although Sword and Sorcery films sometimes describe an epic battle between good and evil similar to those found in many High Fantasy movies, they may alternately present the hero as having more immediate motivations, such as the need to protect a vulnerable maiden or village, or even being driven by the desire for vengeance.

The [[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|1982 film adaptation]] of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'', for example, is a personal (non-epic) story concerning the hero's quest for revenge and his efforts to thwart a single megalomaniac—while saving a beautiful princess in the process.  Some critics refer to such films by the term [[Sword and sandal|Sword and Sandal]] rather than Sword and Sorcery, although others would maintain that the Sword and Sandal label should be reserved only for the subset of fantasy films set in ancient times on the planet Earth, and still others would broaden the term to encompass films that have no fantastic elements whatsoever.  To some, the term Sword and Sandal has pejorative connotations, designating a film with a low-quality script, bad acting, and poor production values.

Another important subgenre of fantasy films that has become more popular in recent years is [[contemporary fantasy]].  Such films feature magical effects or supernatural occurrences happening in the "real" world of today.

[[Films with live action and animation]] such as [[Disney]]'s ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', ''[[Pete's Dragon]]'', ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'', and the [[Robert Zemeckis]] film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' are also fantasy films although are more often referred to as Live action/animation hybrids (2 of those are also classified as musicals).

Fantasy films set in the [[afterlife]], called [[Bangsian fantasy|Bangsian Fantasy]], are less common, although films such as the 1991 [[Albert Brooks]] comedy ''[[Defending Your Life]]'' would likely qualify.  Other uncommon subgenres include [[Historical fantasy|Historical Fantasy]] and [[Romantic fantasy|Romantic Fantasy]], although 2003's ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' successfully incorporated elements of both.

As noted above, superhero movies and fairy tale films might each be considered subgenres of fantasy films, although most would classify them as altogether separate movie genres.

==Fantasy movies and the film industry==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:LOTRROTKmovie.jpg|thumb|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'', winner of the 2003 Academy Award for Best Picture]] --&gt;
As a cinematic genre, fantasy has traditionally not been regarded as highly as the related genre of science fiction film.  Undoubtedly, the fact that until recently fantasy films often suffered from the "[[Peplum (film genre)|Sword and Sandal]]" afflictions of inferior production values, over-the-top acting, and decidedly poor special effects was a significant factor in fantasy film's low regard.

Since the early 2000s, however, the genre has gained new respectability in a way, driven principally by the successful adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings'' and J.K. Rowling's ''Harry Potter'' series. Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy is notable due to its ambitious scope, serious tone, and thematic complexity. These pictures achieved phenomenal commercial and critical success, and the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|third installment]] of the trilogy became the first fantasy film ever to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. The ''Harry Potter'' series has been a tremendous financial success, has achieved critical acclaim for its design, thematic sophistication and emotional depth, grittier realism and darkness, narrative complexity, and characterization, and boasts an enormous and loyal fanbase.

Following the success of these ventures, Hollywood studios have greenlighted additional big-budget productions in the genre.  These have included adaptations of the first, second, and third books in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series and the teen novel ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'', as well as adaptations of [[Susan Cooper]]'s ''[[The Dark Is Rising (film)|The Dark Is Rising]]'', [[Cornelia Funke]]'s ''[[Inkheart]]'', [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[The Golden Compass]]'', [[Holly Black]]'s ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles]]'', Nickelodeon's TV show ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', and the ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' segment (along with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s original poem) ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]''

Fantasy movies in recent years, such as ''The Lord of the Rings'' films, the first and third ''Narnia'' adaptations, and the first, second, fourth and seventh ''Harry Potter'' adaptations have most often been released in November and December. This is in contrast to science fiction films, which are often released during the northern hemisphere summer (June–August). All three installments of the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean films|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' fantasy films, however, were released in July 2003, July 2006, and May 2007 respectively, and the latest releases in the ''Harry Potter'' series were released in July 2007 and July 2009. The huge commercial success of these pictures may indicate a change in Hollywood's approach to big-budget fantasy film releases.

==History==
{{Fantasyfilmlist}}

Fantasy films have a history almost as old as the medium itself.  However, fantasy films were relatively few and far between until the 1980s, when high-tech filmmaking techniques and increased audience interest caused the genre to flourish.

In the era of [[silent film]], the earliest fantasy films were those made by French film pioneer [[Georges Méliès]] from 1903. The most famous of these was 1902's ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. In the Golden Age of Silent film (1918–1926) the most outstanding fantasy films were [[Douglas Fairbanks]]' ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1924)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1924), [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Die Nibelungen]]'' (1924), and ''[[Der müde Tod|Destiny]]'' (1921). Other notables in the genre were [[F.W. Murnau]]'s romantic ghost story ''[[Phantom (1922 film)|Phantom]]'', ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' starring [[Elmo Lincoln]], and [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Satan (film)|The Sorrows of Satan]]''.

===1930s===
{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1930s}}
Following the advent of [[sound film]]s, audiences of all ages were introduced from 1937's ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' to 1939's ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.  Also notable of the era, the iconic 1933 film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' borrows heavily from the [[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]] subgenre of fantasy fiction as does such films as the 1935 adaptation of H. Rider Haggard's novel ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'' about an African expedition that discovers an immortal queen known as Ayesha "She who must be obeyed". [[Frank Capra]]'s 1937 picture ''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' transported audiences to the [[Himalaya]]n fantasy kingdom of [[Shangri-La]], where the residents magically never age. Other noteworthy fantasy films of the 30s include ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]'' in 1932 starring [[Johnny Weissmuller]] starting a successful series of talking pictures based on the fantasy-adventure novels by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] and the [[G. W. Pabst]] directed ''[[The Mistress of Atlantis]]'' from 1932. 1932 saw the release of the [[Universal Studios]] monster movie ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' which combined horror with a romantic fantasy twist. more light-hearted and comedic affairs from the decade include films like 1934s romantic drama film [[Death Takes a Holiday]] where [[Fredric March]] plays Death who takes a human body to experience life for three days and 1937s ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]'' where a man is haunted by two fun-loving ghosts who try to make his life a little more exciting.

===1940s===
{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1940s}}
The 1940s then saw several full-color fantasy films produced by [[Alexander Korda]], including ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940), a film on par with ''The Wizard of Oz'', and ''[[Jungle Book (1942 film)|Jungle Book]]'' (1942).  In 1946, [[Jean Cocteau]]'s classic adaptation of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' won praise for its [[Surrealism|surreal]] elements and for transcending the boundaries of the [[fairy tale]] genre.  ''[[Sinbad the Sailor (1947 film)|Sinbad the Sailor]]'' (1947), starring [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], has the feel of a fantasy film though it does not actually have any [[fantastic]] elements.

Several other pictures featuring supernatural encounters and aspects of Bangsian fantasy were produced in the 1940s during [[World War II]].  These include ''[[Beyond Tomorrow (1940 film)|Beyond Tomorrow]]'', ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941 film)|The Devil and Daniel Webster]]'', and ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'', all from 1941, ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1943 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' the musical ''[[Cabin in the Sky (film)|Cabin in the Sky]]'' (1943), the comedy ''[[The Horn Blows at Midnight]]'' and romances such as ''[[The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]]'' (1947), ''[[One Touch of Venus (film)|One Touch of Venus]]'' and ''[[Portrait of Jennie]]'', both 1948.

An astonishing anticpation of the full "sword and sorcery" genre was made in 1941 in Italy by Alessandro Blasetti. ''[[La Corona di Ferro (1941 film)|La Corona di Ferro]]'' presents the struggles of two imaginary kingdoms around the legendary Iron Crown (historically the ancient crown of Italy), with war, cruelty, betrayal, heroism, sex, magic and mysticism, a whirl of events taken from every possible fairy tale and legend source Blasetti could find. This movie is unlike anything done before; indeed, considering that it was finished fifteen years before the publication of Lord Of The Rings, its invention of a vast, national epic mythology is an act of genius. And while the storytelling is rough - due to the need to insert everything - and the resources limited, Blasetti shows how to make a little go a long way through beautifully staged and designed battle and crowd scenes.

Although it's not classified as a fantasy film, [[Gene Kelly]]'s ''[[Anchors Aweigh]]'' had a fantasy sequence called "The King who Couldn't Dance" in which Gene did a song and dance number with [[Jerry Mouse]] from [[Tom and Jerry]].

Because these movies do not feature elements common to high fantasy or [[sword and sorcery]] pictures, some modern critics do not consider them to be examples of the fantasy genre.

===1950s===
{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1950s}}
In the 1950s there were a few major fantasy films, including ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]'' and ''[[The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T]]'', the latter penned by [[Dr. Seuss]].  Jean Cocteau's [[Orphée|Orphic Trilogy]], begun in 1930 and completed in 1959, is based on [[Greek mythology]] and could be classified either as fantasy or surrealist film, depending on how the boundaries between these genres are drawn. Russian fantasy director [[Aleksandr Ptushko]] created three mythological epics from Russian fairytales, ''[[Sadko]]'' (1953), ''[[Ilya Muromets (film)|Ilya Muromets]]'' (1956), and ''[[Sampo (film)|Sampo]]'' (1959). Japanese director [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]'s 1953 film ''[[Ugetsu Monogatari (film)|Ugetsu Monogatari]]'' draws on Japanese classical ghost stories of love and betrayal.

Other notable pictures from the 1950s that feature fantastic elements and are sometimes classified as fantasy are ''[[Harvey (film)|Harvey]]'' (1950), featuring a [[púca]] of [[Celtic mythology]]; ''[[Scrooge (1951 film)|Scrooge]]'', the 1951 adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''; and [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s 1957 masterpiece, ''[[The Seventh Seal]]''. Disney's 1951 animated film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' is also a fantasy classic.

There were also a number of lower budget fantasies produced in the 1950s, typically based on Greek or Arabian legend.  The most notable of these may be 1958's ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'', featuring special effects by [[Ray Harryhausen]] and music by [[Bernard Herrmann]].

===1960s===
{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1960s}}
Harryhausen worked on a series of fantasy films in the 1960s, most importantly ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963). Many critics have identified this film as Harryhausen's masterwork for its [[stop-motion]] animated statues, skeletons, [[harpies]], [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]], and other mythological creatures. Other Harryhausen fantasy and science fantasy collaborations from the decade include the 1961 adaptation of [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Mysterious Island (1961 film)|Mysterious Island]]'', the critically panned ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' starring [[Raquel Welch]], and ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969).

Capitalising on the success of the [[sword and sandal]] genre several Italian [[B-movie]]s based on classical myth were made, including the ''[[Maciste]]'' series. Otherwise, the 1960s were almost entirely devoid of fantasy films. The fantasy picture ''[[7 Faces of Dr. Lao]]'', in which [[Tony Randall]] portrayed several characters from Greek mythology, was released in 1964. But the 1967 adaptation of the Broadway musical ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' removed most of the fantasy elements from [[T. H. White]]'s classic ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', on which the musical had been based. The 1960s also saw a new adaption of Haggard's ''[[She (1965 film)|She]]'' in 1965 starring [[Ursula Andress]] as the immortal "She who must be obeyed" and was followed by a sequel in 1968 ''[[The Vengeance of She]]'' based loosely on the novel [[Ayesha: The Return of She]] both produced by [[Hammer Film Productions]], 1968 also saw the release of ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' based on a story by [[Ian Fleming]] with a script from [[Roald Dahl]].

===1970s===
{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1970s}}
Fantasy elements of [[Arthurian legend]] were again featured, albeit absurdly, in 1975's ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''. Harryhausen also returned to the silver screen in the 1970s with two additional ''Sinbad'' fantasies, ''[[The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1974) and ''[[Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger]]'' (1977). The animated movie ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]'' (1977) had limited success at the box office but achieved status as a [[cult film]]. There was also ''[[The Noah]]'' (1975) which was never released theatrically but became a [[cult favorite]] when it was finally released on DVD in 2006. Some would consider 1977's ''[[Oh, God! (film)|Oh God!]]'', starring [[George Burns]] to be a fantasy film, and ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' (1978) was a successful Bangsian fantasy remake of 1941's ''Here Comes Mr. Jordan'' (not 1943's ''Heaven Can Wait'').

A few low budget "Lost World" pictures were made in the 1970s, such as 1975's ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (1975 film)|The Land That Time Forgot]]''. Otherwise, the fantasy genre was largely absent from mainstream movies in this decade, although 1971's ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' and ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'' were two fantasy pictures in the public eye the former being predominantly from the same team who did ''Mary Poppins'' the latter again being from Roald Dahl in both script and novel.

===1980s===
{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1980s}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Ladyhawke ver1.jpg|200px|thumb|As fantasy film's box office draw increased, so did its star power. 1985's ''[[Ladyhawke]]'', for example, starred [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] and [[Rutger Hauer]].]] --&gt;
1980s fantasy films were initially characterised by directors finding a new spin on established mythologies. Ray Harryhausen brought the monsters of Greek legends to life in ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' while Arthurian lore returned to the screen in [[John Boorman]]'s 1981 ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]''. Films such as [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1985 ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'' and [[Terry Gilliam]]'s 1981–1986 trilogy of fantasy epics (''[[Time Bandits]]'', ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', and ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'') explored a new artist-driven style featuring surrealist imagery and thought-provoking plots. The modern [[sword and sorcery]] boom began around the same time with 1982's ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' followed by ''[[Krull (film)|Krull]]'' and ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' in 1983, as well as a boom in [[fairy tale]]-like fantasy films such as ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]]'' (1985), ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987), and ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]'' (1988).

The 1980s also started a trend in mixing modern settings and [[action movie]] effects with exotic fantasy-like concepts. ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), directed by [[John Carpenter]] and starring [[Kurt Russell]], combined humor, martial arts and classic Chinese folklore in a modern Chinatown setting. ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'', a film about immortal Scottish swordsmen, was released the same year.

[[Jim Henson]] produced two iconic fantasy films in the 80s, the solemn ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'' and the more whimsical and lofty ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]''. Meanwhile, [[Robert Zemeckis]] helmed ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', featuring various famous cartoon characters from animation's "Golden Age," including [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Droopy]], [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]], [[Sylvester the Cat]], [[Tweety Pie]], and [[Jiminy Cricket]], among others.

The '''Fine Arts of Leningrad''' retrospective exhibition ({{lang-ru|Выставка "Изобразительное искусство Ленинграда" 1976 года}}) became the largest showing of Leningrad artists in the Soviet History outside the city, as well as in total one of the most important art exhibitions in USSR of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov. ''Unknown Socialist Realism: The Leningrad School''. Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition took place in the [[Moscow Manege|Moscow Manezh]].

== History and organization ==
The retrospective exhibition ''[[Fine Art of Leningrad|Fine Arts of Leningrad]]'' was opened in Moscow at the end of 1976. The organization and preparation of the exhibition carried out by a specially formed exhibition committee, which consisted of 44 the most authoritative art experts under head of [[Boris Ugarov]]. It published a catalog of the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;''Изобразительное искусство Ленинграда. Каталог выставки''. Л., Художник РСФСР, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibition displayed works of art by painters, sculptors, graphics, masters of arts and crafts, and artists of theater and cinema covering a span of over 40 years. The artworks were presented from the important Soviet art museums, including the [[Russian Museum|State Russian Museum]] and the [[Tretyakov gallery]].

== Contributing artists ==

The two '''fontane dei mostri marini''' are located in the [[Piazza della Santissima Annunziata|Santissima Annunziata plaza]] in [[Florence]].

==History==
The two fountains were placed in 1641 at the sides of the Santissima Annunziata plaza, having been commissioned in 1626. The statues were originally intended to compliment the [[Monument of the Four Moors]] in [[Livorno]]. To this end, artist [[Pietro Tacca]] began to work on them in 1627 with the help of two students: [[Bartolomeo Salvini]] and [[Francesco Maria Bandini]].

In 1641, following the death of Tucca, the fountains were placed in the Santissima Annunziata plaza on opposite sides of the [[Equestrian Monument of Ferdinando I]].

The fountains were restored over a period spanning from 1987 to 1988, and again between May and June 1996 by [[Giovanni Morigi]] under the direction of the Carlo Francini Office of Fine Arts of the City of Florence. Despite these efforts, the statues again began to show signs of material degradation and the fountains were eventually shut down. In 2013, money obtained by the Municipality of Public Land Concession for Special Initiatives was used to initiate a new restorative effort.

==Description==
These two fountains are considered masterpieces among Mannerist sculptures for their beauty and balance, using contemporary marine symbology (such as [[seashell]]s, [[fish]], legendary monsters, garlands of [[shellfish]] and [[algae]], and masks) alongside traditional maritime themes and symbols. As emphasized, for example, by [[Giuseppe Richa]] in ''Notizie Istoriche delle chiese fiorentine'' (XVIII secolo), it was unconventional that sprays of water would not be directed upwards, but sometimes come out from mouths of the monsters directed downwards.

Pietro Tacca's signature (&lt;small&gt;PETRUS TACC F.&lt;/small&gt;) can be found on both fountains; this is most easily read with one's back to the basilica.

'''Frank Spencer Curtis Budgen''' (1 March 1882 – 26 April 1971) was an English [[Painting|painter]], writer and socialist activist acquainted with the author [[James Joyce]].

==Life==
Born in [[Crowhurst, Surrey|Crowhurst]], [[Surrey]], Budgen spent six years at sea before working in [[London]] as a postal worker. He changed jobs a number of times before travelling to [[Paris]] in 1910 to study painting. He supported himself there by working as a model for the Swiss sculptor [[August Suter (sculptor)|August Suter]] (1887-1965)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jjon.org/jioyce-s-people/suter jjon.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and became acquainted with the French writer [[Blaise Cendrars]] and the Swiss poet and translator [[:de:Siegfried Lang|Siegfried Lang]]. At the invitation of August Suter he moved to Switzerland shortly before [[World War I]]. Here he was employed by the British government at the Ministry of Information, an institution established in [[Zürich]] for "the spread of British propaganda in neutral countries."  He returned to London after the war, where he remained until his death. Budgen was a member of the [[Socialist Labour Party (UK, 1903)|Socialist Labour Party]] and eventually its general secretary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/challinor/1977/british-bolshevism/ch05.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He translated and published the first cheap edition of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' with Lily G. Aitken.&lt;ref&gt;The Socialist Labour Press, Glasgow, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; Budgen never lost contact with his Swiss friends and paid several visits to Switzerland to meet August and Paul Suter as well as Siegfried Lang. He was a guest of honour at the first James-Joyce-Symposium in Dublin in 1967.

Frank Budgen was married to Francine Budgen (11 June 1896 – 16 April 1977) with daughter Joan.&lt;ref&gt;''A Wake Newslitter'', New Series, Vol. IX, Nr. 1, February 1972, "Frank Budgen Issue"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne F. Cooper, ''Claude McKay: rebel sojourner in the Harlem Renaissance: a biography'', Schocken Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Joyce and Budgen spent much of the war in the same city, Zurich, and similar social circles of artists,&lt;ref&gt;There is a [http://www.joycefoundation.ch/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BudgenWeb.jpg statue of Frank Budgen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714160125/http://www.joycefoundation.ch/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BudgenWeb.jpg |date=2014-07-14 }} by his sculptor friend August Suter on Uraniastrasse 9&lt;/ref&gt; writers and musicians. According to Budgen's 1934 memoir ''James Joyce and the Making of Ulysses'', Joyce regularly discussed aesthetic matters with him, often referring to the content of Joyce's ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'', ''Ulysses'' and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. The last of these three, Budgen stated, Joyce referred to at the time as ''Work in Progress''; indeed a number of the conversations he reports as having had with Joyce imply that the author was working out the form and content of this work in part by arguing with Budgen.

Joyce scholar Clive Hart wrote about him:&lt;blockquote&gt;One of Budgen's many fine qualities was a gift for making new friendships with people of all ages. Although he used occasionally to grumble about the unfortunate effects of technological progress on the quality of life in London and elsewhere, he never failed, even in his last years, to welcome new life, new experience. In his thirties, when he and Joyce were closest, Budgen must have been a most stimulating companion. Even in his eighties he was an excellent man at a party, enjoying the company of people of all kinds, being lionized by many of the men and by virtually all of the women, talking with zest, listening (as few people do) with equal zest. It was when he was in the company of a number of his friends that one saw most clearly the vigorous, intelligent, endlessly curious man whom Joyce had known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hart|first=Clive|title=Introduction|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/JoyceColl/JoyceColl-idx?type=turn&amp;id=JoyceColl.BudgenUlysses&amp;entity=JoyceColl.BudgenUlysses.p0008&amp;isize=text|work=James Joyce and the Making of "Ulysses"|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Frank and Francine Budgen are buried at the graveyard of St George’s Church, Crowhurst, Surrey.

'''French post-structuralist feminism''' takes [[post-structuralism]] and combines it with [[feminist]] views and looks to see if a literary work has successfully used the process of [[mimesis]] on the image of the female. If successful, then a new image of a [[woman]] has been created by a woman for a woman, therefore it is not a biased opinion created by [[men]]. Along with [[Luce Irigaray]] and [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Hélène Cixous]] is considered one of the mothers of poststructuralist feminist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zffBjzTsRHUC&amp;pg=PA88 |title=Feminism: a paradigm shift |page=88 |first=Neeru |last=Tandon |year=2008 |isbn=9788126908882}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, these three together with [[Bracha Ettinger]] have considerably influenced French feminism and [[Feminist psychology|feminist]] [[psychoanalysis]].

==''L’Écriture féminine''==
''[[Écriture féminine]]'' literally means ''women's writing.'' It is a [[philosophy]] that promotes women's experiences and feelings to the point that it strengthens the work. It is a strain of feminist literary theory that originated in France in the 1970s.

[[Hélène Cixous]] first uses this term in her essay, ''The Laugh of the Medusa'' in which she asserts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Woman must write her self: must write about women and bring women to writing, from which they have been driven away as violently as from their bodies. Écriture féminine places experience before language, and privileges the anti-linear, cyclical writing so often frowned upon by patriarchal society.''{{cite quote|date=April 2017}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Important French post-structuralist feminists==
===Hélène Cixous===

In the 1970s, Cixous began writing about the relationship between sexuality and language. Like many other feminist theorists, Cixous believes that human sexuality is directly tied to how people communicate in society.

====The Laugh of the Medusa====
In [[Hélène Cixous]]' essay "The Laugh of the Medusa", she discusses how women have been repressed through their bodies all through history. She suggests that if women are forced to remain in their bodies as a result of male repression then they can do one of two things. The first option is to remain trapped inside their bodies, thereby perpetuating the passivity women have been a party to throughout history. The second option is to use the female body as a medium of communication, a tool through which women can speak. This is ironic given the body, the very thing women have been defined by and trapped within, can now become a vehicle in transcending the boundaries once created by the body.&lt;ref name = "adv"/&gt;

In the original myth Medusa was a beautiful woman who confronted endless hardships that were brought about by the actions of men. She was raped, killed, and beheaded by various gods. However even in the face of tragedy and disgrace, Medusa was still portrayed as a meaningful figure. Following the moment her head was cut off, a Pegasus flew out of her body, representing the birth of beauty.

In the more popular version known by most today, Medusa is a monster with hair of a thousand snakes whose glance will turn anything she looks at into stone. Cixous claims that this monstrous image of Medusa exists only because it has been directly determined by the male gaze. Even though this version of the myth is misrepresentative of the original version, people continue to believe the modern version without question.&lt;ref name = "adv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/english/English295/albright/main1.htm |title=Helene Cixous' "The Laugh of the Medusa" Resource Page |date=April 17, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cixous suggests that it is important for women to expose the flaws in language that currently exist. Through the awareness of such flaws, as well as the invention of new ways of expression, women can overcome the obstacles that are constructed by what she labels a phallocentric discourse. She argues that even through attempts to expose current inadequacies, it will always be impossible to define a feminine practice of writing because this practice can never be theorized, enclosed, coded. "It will always surpass the discourse that regulates the phallocentric system; it does and will take place in areas other than those subordinated to philosophico-theoretical domination. It will be conceived of only by those who are breakers of automatisms." &lt;ref name = "adv"/&gt;

===Luce Irigaray===
Born in [[Belgium]] in 1932 Irigaray is a French feminist, psychoanalytic, and cultural theorist. Best known works: Speculum of the Other Woman (1974) and This Sex is Not One (1977).
She was inspired by the psychoanalytic theories of [[Jaques Lacan]] and the deconstruction of Jaques Derrida. Her work aims to reveal a perceived masculine philosophy underlying language and gestures toward a “new” feminine language that would allow women to express themselves if it could be spoken.

===Julia Kristeva===
Born on June 24, 1941 in [[Bulgaria]] Kristeva is a Bulgarian-French philosopher, [[literary critic]], [[psychoanalyst]], [[feminist]], and (most recently) novelist, who has lived in France since the mid-1960s. [[Julia Kristeva]] has become influential in today's international critical analysis, cultural theory, and feminism after publishing her first book ''Semeiotikè'' in 1969.
Although Kristeva does not refer to her own writing as feminist, many feminists turn to her work in order to expand and develop various discussions and debates in feminist theory and criticism.

Three elements of Kristeva's thought have been particularly important for feminist theory in Anglo-American contexts:
*Her attempt to bring the body back into discourses in the human sciences;
*Her focus on the significance of the maternal body and pre-oedipal in the constitution of subjectivity; and
Her notion of abjection as an explanation for oppression and discrimination.

===Critique of classical psychoanalysis===
[[Sigmund Freud]] established the initial theories which would serve as a basis for some of Cixous' arguments in her writings. Freud's analysis of gender roles and sexual identity concluded with separate male ([[Oedipus]]) and female ([[Electra]]) theories of which Cixous was critical. For [[Bracha Ettinger]] both Oedipus and Electra are complexes that belong to the phallic paradigm. She proposes a different paradigm: the feminine-matrixial borderspace.

[[File:HMV GV 116 t.jpg|thumb|right|A '''G.V. Series''' (G.V.116) recording of the 1941 songs "El estagiario / Mi refugio" by Argentine [[Carlos Di Sarli]] y su [[Orquesta típica]]. Thousands of such records were sent to colonial Africa in the 1940s, sparking the creation of new musical styles across the continent.]]
The '''G.V. Series''' (perhaps for ''Grabación Victor'')&lt;ref&gt;White 2002 and Stewart 2004 offer several variations on G. V.'s real and perceived meanings, which include "Grabación Victor" ("Victor Recording" in Spanish), "Grabado en Venezuela" (recorded in Venezuela), "Gramophone Victor", and a popular Congolese nickname "Grands Vocalistes" (great singers). White (2002) also reports it may only be an [[EMI]] records code which lies between G.U. and G.W.&lt;/ref&gt; were a series of 10&amp;nbsp;inch [[78 rpm]] [[Gramophone record]]s produced in Europe and the United States from 1933 to 1958, and exported (or repressed on site) to colonial Tropical Africa. They are credited with introducing [[Afro-Cuban music]] into modern African popular culture. The resulting re-interpretations influenced the creation of several genres of African popular music.

==The Series==
Over 250 titles (double sided records) were produced in the G.V. Series. The records were launched by the British [[EMI]] company's [[His Master's Voice]] label in 1933, in part because of shrinking demand during the [[Great Depression]]. In the 1940s, HMV reached agreement with other companies, such as [[RCA Victor]] to share the royalties of their artists in the production of G.V. Series recordings. Thereafter local distributors were able to request, or press themselves, any of the back catalog of these companies for relatively low cost in Africa, making the records affordable to African listeners for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;White (2002) describes this process, citing Gronow, P. The Recording Industry: An Ethnomusicological Approach. Tampere, Finland: University of Tampere Press (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time in West Africa (what became [[Nigeria]] and [[Ghana]], specifically) EMI was recording and releasing [[Sakara music|Sakara]], [[Juju]] and [[Apala]] music on 78rpm discs in the ''[[Parlophone]] B'', ''HMV JL'', ''HMV JZ'' and ''[[Decca Records|Decca]] WA/GWA/NGA'' series (1947–52), as well as HMV owned local labels, such as Ghana's [[Taymani Special]].&lt;ref&gt;see Chapter Twenty (pp.149–156) of John Collins. Musicmakers of West Africa. Lynne Rienner Publishers (1985) {{ISBN|0-89410-075-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there were also domestic record producers beginning to appear in Anglophone West Africa, Francophone Central African music was based on the twin poles of small domestic labels of the 1940s and 50s, and the Latin music supplied by the G.V. Series records and later competitors from [[Pathé Marconi]] and Decca.&lt;ref&gt;For the impact of the G.V. Series vs. these series of domestic music on Ghanaian and Nigerian music see: John Low. 'A History of Kenyan Guitar Music: 1945–1980', African Music, VI, 2,1982, pp.23–24&lt;br&gt;
Christopher Waterman. Juju: A Social History and Ethnography of an African Popular Music, Chicago, University of Chicago Press (1990), pp.46–47&lt;/ref&gt;  Anglophone West Africa also had twin advantages of having had access to domestic recording and the distribution across West Africa of these recordings by the HMV owned [[Zonophone]] label of African music from 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon. Savannaphone. FolkRoots No.122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuban music in Africa==
While the G.V. Series drew on a wide back catalogue of music, they are best known as the first exposure many Africans had to [[Afro-Cuban]] music (specifically [[Son Cubano|Son]] and [[Son montuno]]). Some musicians of the era still refer to these songs not by the Spanish language titles but by the G.V. numbers of their records.&lt;ref&gt;"The influence that they had may be measured in part by older musicians recalling Cuban tunes by the HMV catalogue number rather than the proper title." – Paul Vernon. [http://www.bolingo.org/audio/texts/fr145eastafrica.html Feast of East].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine initial G.V. records were released in 1933, drawn from EMI's back catalogue of '"''general ethnic''" or "''Spanish''" recordings, with G.V. 1 being "''[[The Peanut Vendor]]''" by [[Don Azpiazu &amp; his Havana Casino Orchestra]], recorded New York City, 13 May 1930.&lt;ref&gt;John Cowley. [http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/ubunca.htm uBungca (Oxford Bags): Recordings in London of African and West Indian music in the 1920s and 1930s]. Musical Traditions No 12, Summer 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note were Cuban artists such as Son combo [[Sexteto Habanero]], [[Trio Matamoros]], [[Don Azpiazú]], [[Abelardo Valdés]], [[Antonio Machin]], as well as big band leader [[Xavier Cugat]], originally recorded in the United States for the American market.

These records spawned some of the most successful modern musical styles West Africa, Central Africa, and East Africa. The most notable of these styles is [[African Rumba|Congolese Rumba]] ("''Soukous''") which developed in [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]], Belgian Congo (modern Kinshasa, [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]]) in the 1940s and 50s. The guitar styles of [[Highlife music]] in British colonial West Africa were also highly influenced by these records, as were the stylings of the Dakar sound in Senegal.  African guitar playing in general, and the electric guitar in particular, was popularised in part by the music distributed in the G.V. Series records. The music of East Africa was also influenced by the G.V. series, sold through East African Music Stores in [[Nairobi]] as its agents in [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]] and [[Dar-es-Salaam]]. But here too, the Cuban musics of the G.V. series quickly had to complete with domestic music produced by EMI and specialist labels like [[Odeon Swahili]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Vernon.

'''Gourd art''' involves creating works of [[art]] using ''[[Lagenaria]] spp.'' hard-shell gourds as an art medium. Gourd surfaces may be carved, painted, sanded, burned, dyed, and polished. Typically, a harvested gourd is left to dry over a period of months before the woody surface is suitable for decorating.

Gourd decoration, including [[pyrography]], is an ancient tradition in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] as well as among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], notably the central highland people of [[Peru]], the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]], [[Hopi]] and [[Pueblo]] nations of the [[American Southwest]], and the [[Nuxálk Nation|Nuxálk]] and [[Haida people|Haida]] nations of [[British Columbia]]. Gourd crafting and painting has evolved from early hand carvings to the modern day use, by some, of electric wood burners and high-speed pen-shaped rotary tools that can be used to inscribe almost any design. 

A wide variety of gourd shapes and sizes yields an array of art pieces, including: ornaments, bowls, sculpture, vases, and wall art such as masks. Artistic styles can range from craft to fine art. Perhaps the most prolific and successful gourd artist in the United States is Robert Rivera of New Mexico.

The American Gourd Society, headquartered in [[Kokomo, Indiana]], was founded in 1937 and publishes its own [[magazine]]. The Canadian Gourd Society was formed in 1999 and is located in [[Kitchener, Ontario]]. Both are national nonprofit organizations dedicated to the education and instruction of those interested in gourd history, cultivation, painting, crafts, and participating in competitions. Gourd Art shows and festivals occur in many places throughout [[North America]], the oldest running festival was founded in [[North Carolina]] in 1942. In recent years, [[Internet]] technology has considerably broadened exposure to the art form which in turn has helped generate a marked increase in the number of participants. In North America, gourd art has been the subject of specialty television programs such as ''[[The Carol Duvall Show]]'' on [[Home &amp; Garden Television]]. No longer considered just a [[craft]], gourd art is being elevated to the point where it has been featured in a number of galleries and magazines and exhibited at the [[United States Botanic Garden]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

In 2003, gourd artists from the United States, [[Australia]], and Canada got together to create the world's first Gourdpatch [[quilt]]. Each artist brought their particular artistic style to a flat 4" × 4" gourd tile which was stitched together to create a quilt.

{{Culture of Indonesia}}
It is quite difficult to define '''Indonesian art''', since the country is immensely diverse. The sprawling archipelago nation consists of 13,466 islands.&lt;ref name="NG-Indonesia-Island"&gt;{{cite news|  title = Hanya ada 13.466 Pulau di Indonesia | date = 8 February 2012 | work = National Geographic Indonesia | url=http://nationalgeographic.co.id/berita/2012/02/hanya-ada-13466-pulau-di-indonesia | language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 922 of those permanently inhabited,&lt;ref&gt;Based on "Seminar Nasional Penetapan Nama Pulau-pulau Kecil Dalam Presektif Sejarah" or "National Seminary of Name For Little Islands From History Side", 16 to 18 July 2008 at [[Palembang]], South Sumatra, Indonesia&lt;/ref&gt; by over 300 [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|ethnic groups]],&lt;ref&gt;Kuoni - Far East, A world of difference.

Indonesia also has experienced a long [[History of Indonesia|history]], with each period leaves a distinctive arts. From [[Prehistoric Indonesia|prehistoric]] cave paintings and [[megalithic]] ancestral statues of Central Sulawesi, tribal wooden carving traditions of [[Toraja]] and [[Asmat people]], graceful Hindu-Buddhist art of classical Javanese civilization which produced [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]], vivid [[Balinese Painting|Balinese paintings]] and [[Balinese dance|performing arts]], [[Islamic art]]s of [[Aceh]], to contemporary arts of modern Indonesian artists. Both Indonesian diversity and history add to complexity on defining and identifying what is Indonesian art.

===Painting=== 
{{see|List of Indonesian painters}}
[[File:Balinese Cockfighting.jpg|thumb|Traditional Balinese painting depicting [[cockfighting]]]]
Prehistoric [[cave painting]]s were discovered in numbers of sites in Indonesia.

The cave paintings was estimated dated from circa 10,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = Antara | title = "Karst" Sangkulirang-Mengkalihat Menuju Situs Warisan Dunia | date = 27 April 2014 | author = Masnun Masud | url = http://www.antarakaltim.com/berita/20228/karst-sangkulirang-mengkalihat-menuju-situs-warisan-dunia | language = Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Floral designs are part of Indonesian culture

The art of [[painting]] is quite well-developed in [[Bali]], where its people are famed for their artistry. The [[Balinese art]] paintings tradition started as classical [[Kamasan]] or [[Wayang]] style visual narrative, derived from East Javanese visual art discovered on East Javanese [[Candi of Indonesia|candi]] bas reliefs. Balinese painting tradition is notable for its highly vigorous yet refined intricate art which resembles baroque folk art with tropical themes. [[Ubud]] and [[Batuan, Bali|Butuan]] in Bali are well known for their paintings. Numbers of painter artists have settled in Bali, which in turn developed the island into a world's artists enclave. Balinese painting is also a sought-after collection or souvenir for visitors in Bali.

Modern Indonesian paintings were pioneered by [[Raden Saleh]], a 19th-century Arab-Javanese painter renowned for his [[Romanticism|romantic]]-naturalistic work during [[Dutch East Indies]] period in Indonesia. A popular genre developed during colonial Dutch East Indies is called ''Mooi Indie'' (Dutch for "Beautiful Indies"), which mostly capture the romantic scenes of colonial Indies.

===Sculpture===
[[File:Prajnaparamita Java Side Detail.JPG|thumb|[[Prajñāpāramitā]] statue from East Java]]
Megalithic sculpture has been discovered in several sites in Indonesia. Subsequently, tribal art has flourished within the culture of [[Nias people|Nias]], [[Batak people|Batak]], [[Asmat people|Asmat]], [[Dayak people|Dayak]] and [[Toraja]]. Wood and stone are common materials used as the media for sculpting among these tribes.

Between 8th to 15th century, Javanese civilization has developed a refined stone sculpting art and architecture which was influenced by Hindu-Buddhist [[Dharmic]] civilization. The celebrated example is the temples of [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]]. The [[Shailendra dynasty|Shailendra]] reign of [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] has produced multiple temples also with its refined sculpture of Hindu and Buddhist deities. Fine example includes the Buddhas image of Borobudur with its serene expression, Vairocana flanked by Padmapani and Vajrapani in [[Mendut]] temple, also Hindu pantheon of Shiva Mahadewa, Brahma, Vishnu, Ganesha, Durga, Agastya and Nandi in Prambanan temple compound. The [[Prajnaparamita of Java]] is a masterpiece of Javanese classical Hindu-Buddhist art, created in 13th century [[Singhasari kingdom|Singhasari]], East Java.&lt;ref name="National Museum"&gt;{{cite web | title=Collectionː Prajnaparamita|publisher=National Museum of Indonesia|url= http://www.museumnasional.or.id/collections/arkeologi/prajnaparamita.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of wood carving is quite well-developed in Indonesia. Other than tribal art woodcarvings of Asmat, Dayak, Nias, and Toraja—certain area is well known for its refined wood carving culture; they are [[Jepara]] in Central Java, and [[Bali]]. [[Mas, Bali|Mas village]] near Ubud in Bali is renowned for their wood carving art. Balinese woodcarving today has a sustained tourist market in Bali.

==Functional art==
Functional art refers to objects that mainly serve practical purposes. Functional art includes objects related to a human's essential needs and necessities, such as clothing, dwelling, tools and other useful objects, which are often decorated and embellished in ways that do not necessarily serve the functional purpose of the object itself. The main example of daily functional objects that developed into work of arts include: textiles and weavings; wicker objects made from plants fibers; and tools and containers, such as [[bamboo]] and [[rattan]] weaving. One of the most elaborate examples of functional art is the traditional dwelling structures in Indonesian vernacular architecture.

===Wicker===

Wooden materials, coconut shell and plants fibers; such as reed, bamboo and rattan has long being used in traditional weavings in Indonesian traditional society to create tools or containers. Examples includes woven [[noken]] bag created by native Papuans, [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] weaved bamboo containers and cooking utensils, to Dayak and Torajan wicker woven hats.

Artifacts such as food and drink containers, dated from 400&amp;nbsp;BC to AD 100 have been found, mostly as burial gifts.&lt;ref name="Zahorka"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Sunda Kingdoms of West Java, From Tarumanagara to Pakuan Pajajaran with the Royal Center of Bogor | first = Herwig | last = Zahorka | publisher = Yayasan Cipta Loka Caraka | location = Jakarta | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xSRwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kathleen McArthur''' (1915–2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McArthur, Kathleen (1915 - 2000)|url=https://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/mcarthur-kathleen.html|website=Australian National Herbarium|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was an [[Australia]]n [[natural history|naturalist]], [[writer]], [[botanical illustrator]] and [[Conservation movement|conservationist]].  She was born in [[Brisbane, Queensland]] to Catherine and Daniel Evans.  Her mother was a daughter of the Durack pastoral family, her father a co-founder of an engineering firm.  She married Malcolm McArthur in 1938 and had three children before divorcing in 1947.  From 1942 she lived at [[Caloundra]] on the [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]] of Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Judith. (1997). ''Brilliant Careers: Women collectors and illustrators in Queensland'', p. 60. Queensland Museum. {{ISBN|0-7242-7693-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The environmental activist==
McArthur was a strong environmentalist and a co-founder, with [[Judith Wright]], [[David Fleay]] and Brian Clouston, of the [[Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland]] in 1962, and served as vice-president from then until 1965.  In 1963 she founded the [[Caloundra]] branch of the society.

She was involved in several campaigns during the 1960s and 1970s to preserve landscapes threatened by economic development, including the [[Pumicestone Passage]], the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and [[Great Sandy National Park|Cooloola]].  Much campaign work was funded through her growing and selling native plants as well as through exhibitions of her wildflower paintings.  She was especially concerned for the [[Wallum]] country of south-eastern Queensland, a habitat characterised by floristically-rich coastal heath and swamps on deep sandy soils.

The spider, ''Ozicrypta mcarthurae'', was named after her for her outstanding contribution to conservation. In 1996 she was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[doctorate]] by [[James Cook University]] of North Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Judith. (1997). ''Brilliant Careers: Women collectors and illustrators in Queensland'', p. 61. Queensland Museum. {{ISBN|0-7242-7693-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
McArthur wrote a weekly column, ''Wildlife and Landscape'', for her local paper.  She also started the Lunch Hour Theatre in Caloundra, a monthly event for which she wrote scripts based on environmental, biographical and historical subjects.  Books authored (and illustrated) by McArthur include:
* 1959 – ''Queensland Wildflowers – A Selection''. Jacaranda Press: Brisbane.
* 1978 – ''Pumicestone Passage: A Living Waterway''. Bacchus Printing: Brisbane.

"'''Lauda Sion Salvatorem'''" is a [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]] prescribed for the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] for the feast of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]. It was written by [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] around 1264, at the request of [[Pope Urban IV]] for the new Mass of this feast, along with ''[[Pange Lingua Gloriosi Corporis Mysterium|Pange lingua]]'', ''[[Sacris solemniis]]'', ''[[Adoro te devote]]'', and ''[[Verbum supernum prodiens]]'', which are used in the Divine Office. 

==Overview==
The [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]] melody of the "Lauda Sion" is borrowed from the eleventh-century sequence ''Laetabundi iubilemus'' attributed to [[Adam of Saint Victor]].

The hymn tells of the institution of the [[Eucharist]] and clearly expresses the belief of the Roman Catholic Church in [[transubstantiation]], that is, that the bread and wine truly become the Body and Blood of Christ when consecrated by a validly-ordained priest or bishop during the Mass. 

"Lauda Sion" is one of only four medieval Sequences which were preserved in the [[Tridentine Mass|''Missale Romanum'']] published in 1570 following the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563)—the others being [[Victimae paschali laudes]] (Easter), [[Veni Sancte Spiritus]] (Pentecost), and [[Dies Irae]] (Requiem Masses). (A fifth, [[Stabat Mater]], would later be added in 1727.) Before Trent, many feasts had their own sequences.&lt;ref&gt;David Hiley, ''Western Plainchant : A Handbook'' (OUP, 1993), II.22, pp.172-195&lt;/ref&gt; The "Lauda Sion" is still sung today, though its use is optional in the post-[[Vatican II]] [[Mass of Paul VI|Ordinary form]]. 

As with St. Thomas' other three Eucharistic hymns, the last few stanzas of the "Lauda Sion" are often used alone, in this case, to form the ''Ecce panis Angelorum''.

{{Expand Japanese|美白|date=September 2014}}
[[File:Japanese lady shoulder in Tōkyō.jpg|thumb|right|Shoulder of a woman from [[Tokyo]], showing her pale skin tone]]
{{nihongo|'''''Bihaku'''''|美白}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term meaning "beautifully white" which was coined in the early 1900s with the emergence of [[skin whitening]] products and cosmetics. Even in ancient Japanese Haiku there have been numerous references to this.

== Summary ==
Although [[skin tone]] differs based on a person's [[Race (human classification)|racial background]], those with fair skin have difficulty maintaining{{clarify|date=September 2018}} skin tone due to melanin production. In Japan the [[Physical attractiveness|preference]] for skin that is white and free of blemishes has been documented since at least the [[Heian period]] (794-1185), as in books like ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Hitotsubashi University|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43294433|volume=30|number=2|year=1998|journal=Hitotsubashi Journal of Social Studies|title=THE USE OF RACE AND RACIAL PERCEPTIONS AMONG ASIANS AND BLACKS: THE CASE OF THE JAPANESE AND AFRICAN AMERICANS }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an old proverb {{nihongo|"white skin covers the seven flaws"|色の白いは七難隠す|iro no shiroi wa shichinan kakusu}} which refers to a white-skinned woman being beautiful even if her features are not attractive. 

The cultural fallout of [[Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan]] (1895–1945) has resulted in Taiwanese women becoming consumers of Japanese skin whitening products in the 20th century. [[Mainland China]] has also become a large market for ''bihaku'' products from companies like [[Shiseido]], [[Shu Uemura]] and [[SK-II]] in the 21st century. Further expansion into pan-Asian markets may be represented by [[Girls' Generation]] partnership with [[Dior]] in 2011 to advertise their lightening cream, appealing to [[Korean Wave]] culture consumers.&lt;ref name="Pan"&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Beautiful White: An Illumination of Asian Skin-Whitening Culture|first=Elysia|last=Pan|date=April 2003|publisher=Duke University|pages=23, 27-30, 38, 50-52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bihaku products are highly popular among mature women. They are also popular with teenage girls and those in their twenties who desire to look like pop singers, such as [[Ayumi Hamasaki]], and are promoted in numerous youth fashion magazines such as ''[[Popteen]]'' and ''S Cawaii!''. Bihaku products are also prevalent and a key item in numerous youth subcultures such as [[gyaru]] and ageha girls. An opposition to the idea of fair skin beauty grew with the gyaru subculture called "[[ganguro]]" in the 1990s although died out by the end of the 2000s.

== Method ==
The popular method of ''bihaku'' is to use cosmetics that stop the production of melanin. Traditionally ''[[uguisu no fun]]'' was used to lighten and balance skin tone although today it is considered a luxury item. The most popular products often contain [[sake]] and [[rice bran]] which contain [[kojic acid]].

For skin whitening cosmetics for use by the public, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] has recognized a combination of [[active ingredient]]s. These are mainly [[arbutin]] and [[kojic acid]].&lt;ref name="Pan"/&gt; Other ingredients include [[Vitamin C]] derivatives, [[tranexamic acid]] and ten-odd other types. Many of these active ingredients work through inhibiting  [[catechol oxidase]]. Some types of [[BB cream]], VIORIS products are also said to have skin whitening effects which contributes to the popularity of the cream in Asian markets.

As for other methods of skin whitening, other decolorizing chemicals can be used. Aesthetic skin decolorizing surgeries can also be performed, but excessive cleansings can cause a number of problems, such as facial inflammation, but in the 2000s this is in decline. Historically, [[Uguisu no fun|the droppings]] of the {{nihongo|Japanese bush-warbler|鴬|uguisu}} have been used as an ingredient in face-washes for whitening skin.

[[File:Frida Kahlo, 1937, Memory, the Heart, oil on metal, 40 x 28 cm.jpg|thumb|Frida Kahlo, 1937, ''Memory, the Heart'', oil on metal, 40 x 28 cm]]
'''''Memory, the Heart''''', a 1937 painting by [[Frida Kahlo]], depicts the pain and anguish Kahlo experienced during and after an affair between her husband, artist [[Diego Rivera]], and her sister, [[Cristina Kahlo]].

The painting is sometimes known by the title '''''Recuerdo''''' ('''''Memory''''').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fridakahlo.org/memory-the-heart.jsp ''Memory, the Heart''] at fridakahlo.org&lt;/ref&gt; The oil-on-metal work measures 40 x 28&amp;nbsp;cm, and is held in the collection of Michel Petitjean in Paris, France.

==Description==
Kahlo portrays herself standing on a beach by the water's edge, one foot on the sand and one in the sea, looking towards the viewer with an expressionless face covered in tears. A metal rod goes through a large empty space in her chest. The rod has an image of [[Cupid]] at each end, shown as if riding a [[seesaw]]. Frida's heart is represented by a large bleeding mutilated organ lying outside her body. The blood from the heart seeps into the sand and flows into the sea. Two dresses, one a schoolgirl dress, the other her traditional [[Tehuantepec]]-style costume, hang near Frida; not empty, they contain one human arm apiece. The schoolgirl dress arm reaches for but does not touch Frida, while the arm in the Tehauna dress supports the armless and immobile artist.

These symbols and others in the painting show the artist's immense pain, and her personal emotional damage and rebuilding, resulting from the affair between her sister and husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torton Beck|first=Evelyn|date=2006|title=Kahlo's World Spilt Open|url=|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=32|pages=54–81|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fridakahlo.org/memory-the-heart.jsp ''Memory, the Heart''] at fridakahlo.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Million Dollar Baby''''' is a 2004 American [[Sport film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed, co-produced, and scored by [[Clint Eastwood]], and starring Eastwood, [[Hilary Swank]], and [[Morgan Freeman]]. This film is about an underappreciated boxing trainer, the mistakes that haunt him from his past, and his quest for atonement by helping an underdog amateur boxer achieve her dream of becoming a professional.

''Million Dollar Baby'' opened to wide acclaim from critics, and won four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Its screenplay was written by [[Paul Haggis]], based on short stories by [[F.X. Toole]], the pen name of fight manager and [[cutman]] Jerry Boyd. Originally published under the title ''Rope Burns'', the stories have since been republished under the film's title.

==Plot==
Margaret "Maggie" Fitzgerald ([[Hilary Swank|Hilary Swank]]), a waitress from a [[Missouri]] town in the [[Ozarks]], shows up in the Hit Pit, a run-down [[Los Angeles]] gym  owned and operated by Frankie Dunn ([[Clint Eastwood]]), an old, cantankerous boxing trainer. Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he initially refuses. Maggie works out tirelessly each day in his gym, even after Frankie tells her she's "too old" to begin a boxing career at her age. Eddie "Scrap-Iron" Dupris ([[Morgan Freeman]]), Frankie's friend and employee—and the film's narrator—encourages and helps her.

Frankie's prize prospect, "Big" Willie Little, signs with successful manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Frankie rejecting offers for a championship bout. With prodding from Scrap and impressed with her persistence, Frankie reluctantly agrees to train Maggie. He warns her that he will teach her only the basics and then find her a manager. Other than Maggie and his employees, the only person Frankie has contact with is a local priest, with whom he spars verbally at daily [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]].

Before her first fight, Frankie leaves Maggie with a random manager in his gym, much to her dismay; upon being told by Scrap that said manager deliberately put her up against his best girl (coaching the novice to lose) to give her an easy win, Frankie rejoins Maggie in the middle of the bout and coaches her instead to an unforeseen victory. A natural, she fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division with Frankie's coaching, winning many of her [[lightweight]] bouts with first-round knockouts. Earning a reputation for her [[Knockout|KOs]], Frankie must resort to bribery to get other managers to put their trainee fighters up against her.

Eventually, Frankie takes a risk by putting her in the junior [[welterweight]] class, where her nose is broken in her first match. Frankie comes to establish a paternal bond with Maggie, who substitutes for his estranged daughter. Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for her with Mickey Mack at a diner on her 33rd birthday. Out of loyalty, she declines. Frankie begrudgingly accepts a fight for her against a top-ranked opponent in the UK, where he bestows a [[Irish language|Gaelic]] nickname on her. The two travel to Europe as she continues to win; Maggie eventually saves up enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house, but her mother berates Maggie for endangering her government aid, claiming that everyone back home is laughing at her.

Frankie is finally willing to arrange a title fight. He secures Maggie a $1 million match in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] against the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] women's welterweight champion, Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman, a German ex-prostitute who has a reputation as a dirty fighter. Overcoming a shaky start, Maggie begins to dominate the fight, but after a round has ended, Billie knocks her out with an illegal [[sucker punch]] from behind after the bell has sounded to indicate the end of the round. Before Frankie can pull the corner stool out of the way which was inappropriately placed on its side by Frankie's assistant, Maggie lands hard on it, breaking her neck and leaving her a ventilator-dependent [[Tetraplegia|quadriplegic]].

Frankie is shown experiencing the first three of [[Kübler-Ross model|the five stages of grief]]: first seeking multiple doctors' opinions in denial, then blaming Scrap in anger and later trying to bargain with God through prayer.

In a medical rehabilitation facility, Maggie looks forward to a visit from her family, but they arrive accompanied by an attorney; their only concern is to transfer Maggie's assets to them. She orders them to leave, threatening to sell the house and inform the [[IRS]] of her mother's [[welfare fraud]] if they ever show their faces again.

As the days pass, Maggie develops [[bedsore]]s and undergoes an [[amputation]] for an infected leg. She asks a favor of Frankie: to [[Assisted suicide|help her die]], declaring that she got everything she wanted out of life. A horrified Frankie refuses, and Maggie later bites her tongue repeatedly in an attempt to bleed to death, but the medical staff saves her and takes measures to prevent further suicide attempts. The priest Frankie has harassed for 23 years, Father Horvak, warns him that he would never find himself again if he were to go through with Maggie's wishes.

Frankie sneaks into the gym one night, unaware that Scrap is watching from the shadows. Just before administering a fatal injection of [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]], he finally tells Maggie the meaning of a nickname he gave her, ''[[Macushla|Mo Chuisle]]'' (spelled incorrectly in the film as "mo cuishle"): [[Irish language|Irish]] for "my darling, and my blood" (literally, "my pulse"). He never returns to the gym. Scrap's narration is revealed to be a letter to Frankie's daughter, informing her of her father's true character. The last shot of the film shows Frankie sitting at the counter of a diner where Maggie once took him, and after having a homemade lemon meringue pie with her, said "Now I can die and go to heaven".

==Development and production==
The film was stuck in [[development hell]] for years before it was shot. Several studios rejected the project even when Eastwood signed on as actor and director. Even Warner Bros., Eastwood's longtime home base, would not agree to a [[United States dollar|US$]]30 million budget. Eastwood persuaded Lakeshore Entertainment's Tom Rosenberg to put up half the budget (as well as handle foreign distribution), with Warner Bros. contributing the rest ($15 million). Eastwood shot the film in less than 40 days between June and July 2004.&lt;ref name="Eliot309"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes156"/&gt; Filming took place in Los Angeles and film sets at Warner Bros. Studios.&lt;ref name="Hughes156"/&gt; The term 'Million Dollar Baby' was from the [[nose art]] of a [[World War II]] [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] heavy bomber. Eastwood had his daughter Morgan Colette appear in a brief role as a girl who waves to Swank's character at a gas station.&lt;ref name="Hughes157"&gt;Hughes, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fold 3 WWII Crew photos&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood had confidence in Swank's acting background, but upon seeing Swank's small physique, he had concerns, "I just thought, 'Yeah, this gal would be great. If we can get her trained up. If we can get a little bit more bulk on her, to make her look like a fighter'...She was like a feather. But what happened is, she had this great work ethic."&lt;ref name=cbs1&gt;{{cite web|author=Rebecca Leung |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/02/60II/main677647.shtml |title=Hilary Swank: Oscar Gold – 60 Minutes |publisher=CBS News |date=March 2, 2005 |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, to prepare for her role, Swank underwent extensive training in the ring and weight room gaining 19 pounds of muscle, aided by professional trainer [[Grant L Roberts]].  She trained for nearly five hours every day, winding up with a potentially life-threatening [[staphylococcus]] infection.  She did not tell Eastwood about the infection because she thought it would be out of character for Maggie.&lt;ref name=cbs1/&gt;

==Box office==
''Million Dollar Baby'' initially had a [[limited release]], opening in eight theaters in December 2004.&lt;ref name="Hughes160"&gt;Hughes, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; In its later [[wide release]] opening, the film earned $12,265,482 in North America and quickly became a box-office hit both domestically and internationally. It grossed $216,763,646 in theaters; $100,492,203 in the United States, and $116,271,443 overseas. The film played in theaters for six and a half months.&lt;ref name=boxofficemojo&gt;{{cite web|title=Million Dollar Baby (2004)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=milliondollarbaby.htm|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The film received critical acclaim. It holds a 91% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 261 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Clint Eastwood's assured direction - combined with knockout performances from Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman - help ''Million Dollar Baby'' to transcend its clichés, and the result is deeply heartfelt and moving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/million_dollar_baby/|title=''Million Dollar Baby'' (2004)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has a score of 86 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 39 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/million-dollar-baby/critic-reviews|title=''Million Dollar Baby'' Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' gave the film four stars and stated that "Clint Eastwood's ''Million Dollar Baby'' is a masterpiece, pure and simple," listing it as the best film of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Million Dollar Baby|date=7 January 2005|publisher=rogerebert.com|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041214/REVIEWS/41201004/1023|accessdate=26 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Medved]] stated: "My main objection to ''Million Dollar Baby'' always centered on its misleading marketing, and effort by Warner Brothers to sell it as a movie about a female ''[[Rocky]]'', with barely a hint of the pitch-dark substance that led Andrew Sarris of the ''[[New York Observer]]'' ... to declare that 'no movie in my memory has depressed me more than ''Million Dollar Baby''.'"&lt;ref&gt;Medved, Michael. "My 'Million Dollar' Answer," OpinionJournal/Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. (17 February 2005). [http://townhall.com/columnists/michaelmedved/2005/02/17/my_million_dollar_answer/page/full Archived at TownHall.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2005, the film sparked controversy when some [[Disability rights movement|disability rights activists]] protested the ending. [[Wesley J. Smith]] in ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' also criticized the film for its ending and for missed opportunities; Smith said, "The movie could have ended with Maggie triumphing once again, perhaps having obtained an education and becoming a teacher; or, opening a business managing boxers; or perhaps, receiving a standing ovation as an inspirational speaker."

Eastwood responded to the criticism by saying the film was about the [[American dream]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/13/arts/13rich.html?ex=1265778000&amp;en=20285b456ee22b66&amp;ei=5090&amp;partnrer=rssuserland The New York Times &gt; Arts &gt; Frank Rich: How Dirty Harry Turned Commie]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Eastwood distanced himself from the actions of characters in his films, noting, "I've gone around in movies [[Dirty Harry (film series)|blowing people away with a]] [[.44 Magnum]]. But that doesn't mean I think that's a proper thing to do". Roger Ebert stated that "a movie is not good or bad because of its content, but because of how it handles its content. ''Million Dollar Baby'' is classical in the clean, clear, strong lines of its story and characters, and had an enormous emotional impact".&lt;ref name=spoiler&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050129/COMMENTARY/501290301|title=Critics have no right to play spoiler|accessdate=27 November 2007|author=Roger Ebert|date=29 January 2005|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators {{Who|date=May 2017}} criticized the fact that the phrase ''mo chuisle'', a term of endearment meaning literally "my pulse", and generally "my darling", was misspelled in the film as ''Mo Cuishle'', as shown on the back of Maggie's robe. It is translated in the film as "my darling, my blood", although an Irish Gaelic translation site states that it is always translated as "pulse", not as "blood".&lt;ref&gt;IrishGaelicTranslator.com. [http://www.irishgaelictranslator.com/articles/?p=39 Million Dollar Baby movie]&lt;/ref&gt; The original phrase is short for ''a chuisle mo chroí'', meaning "O pulse of my heart".&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;Wes Davis [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/26/opinion/26davis.html?ex=1267160400&amp;en=63b9bdbd40e19929&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland Fighting Words]. New York Times, 26 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The film has been praised, however, for stirring renewed interest in the Irish language in the U.S.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

==Accolades==

      <comment>This is a misreading of Aristotle's position, see Poetics p.4 ISBN 014-04-4636-2, Aristotle specifically defines poetry as written language and even notes that the term is often incorrectly applied to people who write non-fiction in verse form</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8170">{{Other uses|Mode (disambiguation){{!}}Mode}}

In [[literature]] and other artistic media, a '''mode''' is an unspecific critical term usually designating a broad but identifiable kind of [[literary method]], [[Mood (literature)|mood]], or manner that is not tied exclusively to a particular [[List of narrative forms|form]] or [[Literary genre|genre]]. Examples are the ''satiric'' mode, the ''ironic'', the ''comic'', the ''pastoral'', and the ''didactic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] uses 'mode' in a more specific sense. Kinds of poetry, he writes, may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'' of [[mimesis|imitation]], according to their ''objects'' of imitation, and according to their mode or 'manner' of imitation (section I). "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section III). According to this definition, 'narrative' and 'dramatic' are modes of fiction:
:"This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in Aristotle's differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''[[mimesis]]'' (direct imitation). It has, as we shall see, important consequences for both the logic and the language of the drama."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Elam|1980|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction-writing==
[[Fiction]] is a form of [[narrative]], one of the four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse.  Fiction-writing also has distinct forms of expression, or modes, each with its own purposes and conventions.  Agent and author [[Evan Marshall (agent)|Evan Marshall]] identifies five [[fiction-writing mode]]s: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Marshall|1998|pp=143–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author and writing-instructor [[Jessica Page Morrell]] lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Morrell|2006|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Selgin|2007|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summarization===
Summarization (also referred to as summary, narration, or narrative summary) is the fiction-writing mode whereby story events are condensed.  The reader is told what happens, rather than having it shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Marshall|1998|pp=144–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fiction-writing axiom "[[Show, don't tell]]" the "tell" is often in the form of summarization.

Summarization has important uses:
* To connect one part of a story to another
* To report events whose details aren't important
* To telescope time
* To convey an emotional state over an extended period of time&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Marshall|1998|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To vary the rhythm and texture of the writing&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Browne|King|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of summary is that it takes up less space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Selgin|2007|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to author [[Orson Scott Card]], either action or summarization could be right, either could be wrong.  Factors such as rhythm, pace, and tone come into play.  The objective is to get the right balance between telling versus showing, action versus summarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Card|1988|pp=140–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introspection===
{{main|Introspection}}
Introspection (also referred to as internal dialogue, interior monologue, self-talk) is the fiction-writing mode used to convey a character's thoughts.  As explained by Renni Browne and Dave King, "One of the great gifts of literature is that it allows for the expression of unexpressed thoughts ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Browne|King|2004|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Nancy Kress]], a character's thoughts can greatly enhance a story: deepening characterization, increasing tension, and widening the scope of a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kress|2003|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As outlined by Jack M. Bickham, thought plays a critical role in both [[scene (fiction)|scene]] and [[sequel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bickham|1993|pp=12–22,50–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essay-writing==
According to Frederick Crews, it is traditional and useful to think of essays as falling into four types, corresponding to four basic functions of prose:  ''description'', or picturing; ''narration'', or telling; ''exposition'', or explaining; and ''argument'', or convincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Anker distinguishes between nine different modes of essay writing:  ''narration'', or writing that tells stories; ''illustration'', or writing that gives examples; ''description'', or writing that creates pictures in words; ''process analysis'', or writing that explains how things happen; ''classification'', or writing that sorts things into groups; ''definition'', or writing that tells what something means; ''comparison and contrast'', or writing that shows similarities and differences; ''cause and effect'', or writing that explains reasons or results; and ''argument'', or writing that persuades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Anker|2004|pp=97–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NVA''' is an arts organisation and charity based in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. It was founded in 1992 by [[Angus Farquhar]], a former member of the group [[Test Dept]]. The company's name is an acronym of ''nacionale vitae activa'', a Latin term meaning 'the right to influence public affairs'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/about/ About NVA.] Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is best known for its dramatic, large-scale environmental artworks in Scottish natural landscapes, building on the site-specific performances that Farquhar created with Test Dept. These works have included ''The Secret Sign'', ''The Path'', ''The Storr'' and ''Half Life''. The works are designed to involve local communities and to incorporate regeneration aspects that will benefit the landscapes in the future. For example, improvements were made to the footpaths around The Storr as part of the preparation for that work.

== ''The Secret Sign'' ==

''The Secret Sign'' took place at night on 9–16 May 1998 at The Devil's Pulpit, Finnich Glen, near [[Loch Lomond]]. Audience members were transported by bus (with the windows blacked out) to the site of the work, where they were given hard hats and wading boots. They were then escorted through the glen by members of the company. Various artistic interventions were visible along the way, including lights, sounds, birds of prey and live performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/the+secret+sign/ ''The Secret Sign''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Path'' ==

''The Path'' was a two-hour night-time walk that took place from 19 May – 4 June 2000 at Glen Lyon in Perthshire. Like ''The Secret Sign'' it featured light, sound, performance and music, including Buddhist chant by Ani Choying Drolma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/the+path/ ''The Path''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Storr'' ==

''The Storr'' took place at night from 1 August – 17 September 2005 at [[The Storr]], a rocky hill in [[Trotternish]] on the [[Isle of Skye]]. Audience members were bussed to the site from bases in [[Portree]] and [[Staffin]] and kitted out with head torches and walking sticks. They were then led up to the base of the Old Man of Storr, a natural rock formation. Like the earlier works, the walk was marked by lights, sounds, music and performance. The work contained music by [[Geir Jenssen]] and [[Paul Mounsey]], live performance by [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] singer Ann Martin and recordings of the works of Gaelic poet [[Sorley MacLean]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/the+storr+unfolding+landscape/ ''The Storr''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements of ''The Storr'' included a series of [[LED]] stars which together made up the largest light sculpture ever seen in the UK.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;"[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1532752,00.html Call of the wild]". ''The Guardian'' 21 July 2005. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost of mounting the work was £1 million.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

== ''Half Life'' ==

''Half Life'' took place at [[Kilmartin Glen]], [[Argyll]] from 4–16 September 2007, and was a collaboration between NVA and the [[National Theatre of Scotland]]. It consisted of two parts: a daytime element, where visitors could explore a series of sites and installations based around known and rarely seen prehistoric landmarks; and a night-time element, consisting of an outdoor production staged in a forest location at the entrance to the glen, centred on a sculptural set constructed from felled logs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/half+life/ ''Half Life''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''White Bike Plan'' ==

In April 2010 NVA re-enacted Witte Fietsenplan (White Bike Plan), a free transport programme by the Provos, the Dutch counter culture movement of the 1960s. NVA released 50 white bicycles across the city, which were available for the audience of Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art to travel between venues for the duration of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nva.org.uk/past-projects/witte+feitsenplan+white+bike+plan-24/ ''White Bike Plan''.] Documentation of event on NVA website. Retrieved 8 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Glasgow Harvest'' ==

NVA hosted the first Glasgow Harvest in August 2010 at the Hidden Gardens. Glasgow Harvest was a celebration of urban farming, and encouraged visitors to participate in a mass open-air meal prepared using their home-grown ingredients.
Visitors were invited to contribute to an immense jam wall, sample edible punk haircuts, and submit to competition the creative containers they had used to grow plants. Glasgow's allotments made 12 different soups and 20 local schools participated in the Double Rubble Chip Challenge - making chips at Harvest from potatoes they had grown from seed in their playgrounds.

== ''Speed of Light'' ==
Speed of Light was a major [[Edinburgh International Festival]] 2012 commission, one of Scotland's signature contributions to the [[2012 Cultural Olympiad|Olympic cultural programme]]. Conceived and produced by NVA, the transformation of [[Arthur's Seat]], [[Edinburgh]]'s iconic mountain, combined innovative public art and sport. Using energy-harvesting technologies to illuminate walkers and specially designed battery-powered light suits worn by runners, Speed of Light harnessed collective action to create a multi-layered night-time animation. NVA's Speed of Light also investigated the physical and emotional aspects to endurance running and the extent to which the power of the mind can override physical pain. A series of related blogs, web portraits, events, lectures and co-commissions were presented in partnership with eight of the [[Edinburgh Festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speed of Light: Overview|url=http://nvaspeedoflight.org.uk/#!/page/2/Overview|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Ninja|Ninjas]]''' are historically known as Japanese spies, assassins, or thieves who formed their own caste outside the usual feudal divisions of lords, and samurai surfs. They are often used as [[stock character]]s in [[Japan]]ese and world [[popular culture]].

==History==
[[File:Jiraiya - kuniyoshi - japanese heroes for the twelve signs.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Ninja killing a snake with a sword|[[Jiraiya]] battles a snake with the help of a [[Japanese common toad|toad]]; [[Woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock print]] on paper by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]], about 1843]]

The ninja first entered popular culture in the [[Edo period]], when [[Japanese folklore|folktales]] and plays about ninjas were conceived. In modern Japan, ninjas are a [[national myth]] that stems from [[Folklore|folk tales]] and modern day popular culture.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Phelan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/feb/26/ninja-festival-iga-ueno-japan |title=Tall tales and tiny assassins at Japan's ninja festival |publisher=The Guardian |date=2011-02-26 |accessdate=2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these folk tales are based on historical figures, such as a ''daimyō'' (lord) challenging a ninja to prove his worth by stealing his pillow or weapon while he slept.&lt;ref name="Turnbull2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turnbull|first1=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Turnbull (historian)|title=Ninja AD 1460 - 1650|date=2004|publisher=Osprey|location=Oxford|isbn=9781841765259|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}}

Ninja-themed international media franchises include the 1980s ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' comic book and animated series, and the late-1990s ''[[Naruto]]'' manga and anime series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/487 |title=FROM THE ARCHIVES&amp;nbsp;– Black Belt Magazine |publisher=Blackbeltmag.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117131320/http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/487 |archivedate=November 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hendrix |first=Grady |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/summer_movies/2007/06/the_state_of_the_ninja.single.html |title=The state of the ninja |publisher=Slate.com |date=2007-06-26 |accessdate=2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear left}}

===Legendary abilities===
[[Superhuman]] or [[supernatural]] powers were sometimes associated with the ninja. Such powers include [[flight]], [[invisibility]], [[shapeshifting]], the ability to "split" into multiple bodies, the summoning of animals, and control over the [[Five elements (Japanese philosophy)|five classical elements]]. These notions stemmed from popular imagination regarding the ninja's mysterious status, as well as romantic ideas found in later Japanese art during the [[Edo period]]. Magical powers were sometimes rooted in the ninja's own efforts to disseminate fanciful information. For example, Nakagawa Shoshujin, the 17th-century founder of Nakagawa-ryū, or martial art style, claimed in his own writings (''Okufuji Monogatari'') that he had the ability to transform into birds and animals.&lt;ref name="Turnbull2003"/&gt;{{rp|13}}

Perceived control over the elements may be grounded in real tactics, which were categorized by association with forces of nature. For example, the practice of starting fires in order to cover a ninja's trail falls under ''katon-no-jutsu'' ("fire techniques").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mol|first1=Serge|title=Classical Weaponry of Japan: Special Weapons and Tactics of the Martial Arts|date=2003|publisher=Kodansha International|location=Tokyo|isbn=9784770029416|page=176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ninja's adaption of [[kite]]s in espionage and warfare is another subject of legends. Accounts exist of ninjas being lifted into the air by kites, where they flew over hostile terrain and descended into or dropped bombs on enemy territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Draeger|first1=Donn F.|last2=Smith|first2=Robert W.|title=Comprehensive Asian Fighting Arts|date=1985|publisher=Kodansha International|location=Tokyo|isbn=9780870114366|pages=128–129|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kites were indeed used in Japanese warfare, but mostly for the purpose of sending messages and relaying signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckley|first1=Sandra|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Japanese Culture|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415143448|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|257}} Turnbull suggests that kites lifting a man into midair might have been technically feasible, but states that the use of kites to form a human "[[Hang gliding|hang glider]]" falls squarely in the realm of fantasy.&lt;ref name="Turnbull2003"/&gt;{{rp|22–23}}

====Kuji-kiri====
''[[Kuji-kiri]]'' is an esoteric practice which, when performed with an array of hand "seals" (''[[kuji-in]]''), was meant to allow the ninja to enact superhuman feats.

The ''kuji'' ("nine characters") is a concept originating from [[Taoism]], where it was a string of nine words used in charms and incantations.&lt;ref name="Waterhouse"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waterhouse|first1=David|title=Religion in Japan: Arrows to Heaven and Earth |date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521550284|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–3}} In [[China]], this tradition mixed with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] beliefs, assigning each of the nine words to a Buddhist deity. The ''kuji'' may have arrived in Japan via Buddhism,8-11}} where it flourished within [[Shugendō]].&lt;ref name="Waterhouse"/&gt;{{rp|13}} Here too, each word in the ''kuji'' was associated with Buddhist deities, animals from Taoist mythology, and later, Shinto [[kami]].&lt;ref name="Waterhouse"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}} The ''[[mudrā]]'', a series of hand symbols representing different Buddhas, was applied to the ''kuji'' by Buddhists, possibly through the esoteric ''[[Mikkyō]]'' teachings.&lt;ref name="Waterhouse"/&gt;{{rp|24–25}} The ''[[yamabushi]]'' ascetics of Shugendō adopted this practice, using the hand gestures in spiritual, healing, and [[exorcism]] rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teeuwen|first1=Mark|last2=Rambelli|first2=Fabio|title=Buddhas and Kami in Japan: Honji Suijaku as a Combinatory Paradigm|date=2003|publisher=Routledge Curzon|location=London|isbn=9780415297479|edition=Reprinted\page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the use of ''kuji'' passed onto certain ''[[bujutsu]]'' (martial arts) and ''[[ninjutsu]]'' schools, where it was said to have many purposes.&lt;ref name="Waterhouse"/&gt;{{rp|31–33}} The application of ''kuji'' to produce a desired effect was called "cutting" (''kiri'') the ''kuji''. Intended effects range from physical and mental concentration, to more incredible claims about rendering an opponent immobile, or even the casting of magical spells.&lt;ref name="Waterhouse"/&gt;{{rp|31}} These legends were captured in popular culture, which interpreted the ''kuji-kiri'' as a precursor to magical acts.

In the [[Marvel Universe]], ninjas have been heroes and villains.

In the ''[[Marvel Mangaverse]]'', Spider-Man is the last member of a ninja clan. A sinister ninja cult, [[The Hand (comics)|the Hand]], appears in ''[[X-Men]]'' and ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''. The cult and its associates were responsible for the martial training of Psylocke, [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], Daredevil, [[Black Tarantula]], [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Lady Bullseye]] and Wolverine. The Hand's heroic counterpart is [[The Chaste]], which struggles with its Korean offshoot the True Believers (including Dragonfly Meiko Yin).

Characters with mystical, superhuman martial-arts abilities attributed to ninja appear in the [[DC Universe]]. Bruce Wayne received ninja training prior to becoming Batman. Another character portrayed similarly to a ninja is master martial artist and assassin [[Lady Shiva]]; Shiva killed [[Armless Master]], who trained [[Catwoman]] and [[Hellhound]]. One alternative-universe comic substitutes Batman with a Japanese female ninja named Komori (Bat).&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America: Shogun of Steel'' (Elseworlds, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Alternative versions of Robin|alternative version of Robin]], Tengu, was raised by Cat-Ninja (Catwoman) in feudal Japan.

Joe)|Storm Shadow]], [[Jinx (G.I. Joe)|Jinx]], [[Kamakura (G.I. Joe)|Kamakura]], [[Firefly (G.I. Joe)|Firefly]] and the [[Arashikage]] ninja clan, an extended family of ninja characters.

===1998 East Java ninja scare===
{{Main|1998 East Java ninja scare}}

The [[1998 East Java ninja scare]] was an outbreak of [[mass hysteria]] in [[East Java]], [[Indonesia]], in which the local population believed they were being targeted by sorcerers known as [[ninja]], who were blamed for mysterious killings of religious leaders by assassins dressed in black. As many as 150-300 “sorcerers” were killed between February and October, with the most deaths occurring between August and September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kristof |first1=Nicholas D. |title=Fears of Sorcerers Spur Killings in Java |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/20/world/fears-of-sorcerers-spur-killings-in-java.html |accessdate=June 6, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 20, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuno felting''' is a fabric [[felt]]ing technique developed by Polly Stirling, a fiber artist from New South Wales, Australia, around 1992. The name is derived from the Japanese word "nuno" meaning cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Ziek, B. (2004). The felt frontier: I: Polly Stirling: Contemporary feltmaker. Surface Design Journal, 28(4), 35-38&lt;/ref&gt; The technique bonds loose fibre, usually [[wool]], into a sheer fabric such as [[silk]] gauze, creating a lightweight felt. The fibres can completely cover the background fabric, or they may be used as a decorative design that allows the backing fabric to show. Nuno felting often incorporates several layers of loose fibres combined to build up colour, texture, and/or design elements in the finished fabric.

The nuno felting process is particularly suitable for creating lightweight fabrics used to make clothing. The use of silk or other stable fabric in the felt creates fabric that will not stretch out of shape. Fabrics such as [[nylon]], [[muslin]], or other open weaves can be used as the felting background, resulting in a wide range of textural effects and colours.

[[File:Nuno felt jacket.jpg|thumb|Nuno Felted Jacket by Elynn Bernstein / A Mano Studios]]Nuno felt is an extremely versatile created fabric. It can be made in many weights to accommodate many different uses. It can be made much lighter in weight than traditional all-wool felt accounting for its wonderful movement and drape. Because of the range of weights possible with the cloth very fashionable and exciting garments can be made.

You would make a very light weight nuno fabric by laying one layer of loose fiber onto an open weave fabric base, thus being suitable for a summer dress. A much heavier nuno fabric results from laying 3-4 layers of loose fibers onto an open weave base making fabric suitable for a winter coat. A pair of boots could be made using even more layers of fibers.

Wool is only one kind of fiber that can be used in making this nonwoven cloth. There are hundreds of different wools and fibers to choose from, each with its own unique properties and handling abilities. Different fibers create different surface textures. Other types of fiber that will felt other than sheep's wool are: camel, llama, alpaca, Mohair goat, Cashmere goat, yak, Angora rabbit, beaver, dog, cat, human hair (think dredlocks).

[[File:Blank book on a table.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Blank paperback book]]
A '''paperback''', also known as a '''softcover''' or '''softback''', is a type of book characterized by a thick paper or [[paperboard]] cover, and often held together with [[adhesive|glue]] rather than [[stitch (textile arts)|stitches]] or [[Staple (fastener)|staple]]s. In contrast, [[hardcover]] or hardback books are bound with cardboard covered with cloth. The pages on the inside are made of paper.

Inexpensive books bound in paper have existed since at least the 19th century in such forms as [[pamphlet]]s, [[yellow-backs|yellowback]]s, [[dime novel]]s, and [[airport novel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [[Tauchnitz]] editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern paperbacks can be differentiated by size. In the U.S., there are "[[#Mass-market|mass-market paperbacks]]" and larger, more durable "[[#Trade|trade paperbacks]]." In the U.K., there are A-format, [[#B-format|B-format]], and the largest C-format sizes.&lt;ref name="GuardianSize"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson-Fletcher |first=Honor |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/insidepublishing/story/0,,534924,00.html |accessdate=2006-11-16 |title=Why Size Matters |date=11 August 2001 |publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paperback editions of books are issued when a publisher decides to release a book in a low-cost format. Cheaper, lower quality paper; glued (rather than stapled or sewn) bindings; and the lack of a hard cover may contribute to the lower cost of paperbacks. Paperbacks can be the preferred medium when a book is not expected to be a major seller or where the publisher wishes to release a book without putting forth a large investment. Examples include many novels, and newer editions or reprintings of older books.

Since paperbacks tend to have a smaller [[profit margin]], many publishers try to balance the profit to be made by selling fewer hardcovers against the potential profit to be made by selling more paperbacks with a smaller profit per unit. First editions of many modern books, especially [[genre fiction]], are issued in paperback. Best-selling books, on the other hand, may maintain sales in hardcover for an extended period to reap the greater profits that the hardcovers provide.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

==History==
[[File:Piles of paperback novels (Source).webm|alt=Piles of paperback novels|thumb|268x268px|Piles of [[paperback]] novels]]
The early 19th century saw numerous improvements in the printing, publishing and book-distribution processes, with the introduction of steam-powered printing presses, pulp mills, automatic type setting, and a network of railways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/collections/early/victorian/intro.html The British Library – Aspects of the Victorian book]&lt;/ref&gt; These innovations enabled the likes of Simms and McIntyre of Belfast,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/collections/early/victorian/yellow/yellow1.html The British Library – Yellowbacks – The Parlour Library]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Routledge|Routledge &amp; Sons]] (founded in 1836) and Ward &amp; Lock (founded in 1854) to mass-produce cheap uniform [[yellowbacks|yellowback]] or paperback editions of existing works, and distribute and sell them across the [[British Isles]], principally via the ubiquitous [[W H Smith|W H Smith &amp; Sons]] newsagent found at most urban British railway stations. These paper bound volumes were offered for sale at a fraction of the historic cost of a book, and were of a smaller format, {{convert|110|x|178|mm|in|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="GuardianSize" /&gt; aimed at the railway traveller.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain, volume 6 1830–1914, edited by David McKitterick, {{ISBN|0521866243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Routledge's Railway Library series of paperbacks remained in print until 1898, and offered the traveling public 1,277 unique titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/collections/early/victorian/yellow/yellow2.html The British Library – Yellowbacks – Routledge's Railway Library.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The German-language market also supported examples of cheap paper-bound books: 
Bernhard [[Tauchnitz]] started the Collection of British and American Authors in 1841. These inexpensive, paperbound editions, a direct precursor to mass-market paperbacks, eventually ran to over 5,000 volumes. [[Reclam]] published Shakespeare in this format from October 1857&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Roger |first= Christine |title= La Réception de Shakespeare en Allemagne De 1815 À 1850: Propagation Et Assimilation de la Référence Étrangère |trans-title= The reception od Shakespeare in Germany from 1815 to 1850: the spread and assimilation of foreign reference material |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQliue-UQfkC |accessdate= 2013-02-17 |series= Contacts.

Thousands of titles eventually followed, which included nearly all the world's great literature. In this way, and despite most Western countries' imitations, Reclam paperbacks became the world's foremost paperback series.}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 10 November 1867.

===20th century===
The German publisher [[Albatross Books]] revised the 20th-century mass-market paperback format in 1931, but the approach of [[World War II]] cut the experiment short. It proved an immediate financial success in the United Kingdom in 1935 when [[Penguin Books]] adopted many of Albatross' innovations, including a conspicuous logo and color-coded covers for different genres. British publisher [[Allen Lane]] invested his own financial capital to launch the Penguin Books imprint in 1935, initiating the paperback revolution in the English-language book-market by releasing ten reprint titles. The first released book&lt;!-- does this mean bestseller, or first book printed? --&gt; on Penguin's 1935 list was [[André Maurois]]' ''Ariel''.&lt;ref&gt;McCleery, Alistair. "The Return of the Publisher to Book History: The Case of Allen Lane.” Book History. 5 (2002): 161–185. JSTOR. Web. 10 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lane intended to produce inexpensive books. He purchased paperback rights from publishers, ordered large [[Edition (book)#Print run|print runs]] (such as 20,000 copies—large for the time) to keep [[unit price]]s low, and looked to non-traditional book-selling retail locations. Booksellers were initially reluctant to buy his books, but when [[Woolworths Group plc|Woolworths]] placed a large order, the books sold extremely well. After that initial success, booksellers showed more willingness to stock paperbacks, and the name "Penguin" became closely associated with the word "paperback".{{cn|date=December 2018}}

In 1939, Robert de Graaf issued a similar line in the United States, partnering with [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] to create the [[Pocket Books]] label. The term "pocket book" became synonymous with paperback in English-speaking North America. In French, the term ''livre de poche'' was used and is still in use today. De Graaf, like Lane, negotiated paperback rights from other publishers, and produced many runs. His practices contrasted with those of Lane by his adoption of illustrated covers aimed at the North American market. To reach an even broader market than Lane, he used distribution networks of newspapers and magazines, which had a lengthy history of being aimed (in format and distribution) at mass audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Korda|first1=Michael|title=Another life : a memoir of other people|date=1999|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0679456597|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its number-one position in what became a very long list of pocket editions, [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]]'s ''[[Lost Horizon (novel)|Lost Horizon]]'' is often cited as the first American paperback book. However, the first mass-market, pocket-sized, paperback book printed in the US was an edition of [[Pearl Buck]]'s ''[[The Good Earth]]'', produced by Pocket Books as a proof-of-concept in late 1938, and sold in New York City.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

Through the circulation of the paperback in kiosks and bookstores, scientific and intellectual knowledge was able to reach the masses. This occurred at the same time that the masses were starting to attend university, leading to the student revolts of 1968 prompting open access to knowledge. The paperback book meant that more people were able to openly and easily access knowledge and this led to people wanting more and more of it. This accessibility posed a threat to the wealthy by imposing that it would be turned upside down, as the masses were now able to access almost all of the knowledge the wealthy previously had access to. Treating the paperback as any other book drastically weakened the distinction between high and low culture. The paperback revolution essentially broke this relationship by redefining it through access to knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, Ben. "The Paperback Revolution: Mass-circulation Books and the Cultural Origins of 1968 in Western Europe.” Journal of the History of Ideas. 72.4 (2011): 613–636. JSTOR. Web. 10 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paperback originals==
&lt;!-- [[File:Guy Gibson VC - Enemy Coast Ahead - 1857 Pan paperback book cover.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Guy Gibson]] cover of 1957 [[Pan Books|Pan]] imprint, ''[[Enemy Coast Ahead]]'']] --&gt;
In the United States, many companies entered the paperback publishing field in the years after Pocket Books' inception, including [[Ace Books|Ace]], [[Dell Publishing|Dell]], [[Bantam Books|Bantam]], [[Avon (publishers)|Avon]] and dozens of other smaller publishers. At first, paperbacks consisted entirely of reprints, but in 1950, [[Fawcett Publications]]' [[Gold Medal Books]] began publishing original works in paperback.

Fawcett was also an independent [[newsstand]] distributor, and in 1945, the company negotiated a contract with [[New American Library]] to distribute their Mentor and Signet titles. That contract prohibited Fawcett from becoming a competitor by publishing their own paperback reprints. Roscoe Kent Fawcett wanted to establish a line of Fawcett paperbacks, and he felt original works would not be a violation of the contract. To challenge the contract, Fawcett published two anthologies—''The Best of [[True (magazine)|True]] Magazine'' and ''What Today's Woman Should Know About Marriage and Sex''—reprinting material from Fawcett magazines not previously published in books. When these books were successfully published, he announced Gold Medal Books, a line of paperback originals. Sales soared, prompting Gold Medal editorial director Ralph Daigh to comment, "In the past six months we have produced 9,020,645 books, and people seem to like them very well." However, hardcover publishers resented Roscoe Fawcett's innovation, as evidenced by Doubleday's LeBaron R. Barker, who claimed that paperback originals could "undermine the whole structure of publishing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allanguthrie.co.uk/pages/noir_zine/articles/paperback_originals.php Crider. Bill. "Paperback Originals," ''The Mystery Readers Newsletter'', 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703014426/http://www.allanguthrie.co.uk/pages/noir_zine/articles/paperback_originals.php |date=3 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre categories began to emerge, and mass-market book covers reflected those categories. Mass-market paperbacks influenced slick and [[pulp magazines]]. The market for cheap magazines diminished when buyers began to buy cheap books instead. Authors also found themselves abandoning magazines and writing for the paperback market. The leading paperback publishers often hired experienced pulp magazine cover artists, including [[Rudolph Belarski]] and [[Earle K. Bergey]], who helped create the look and feel of paperbacks and set an appealing visual standard that continues to this day. Scores of well-known authors were published in paperback, including [[Arthur Miller]] and [[John Steinbeck]].

[[World War II]] brought both new technology and a wide readership of men and women now in the military or employed as shift workers; paperbacks were cheap, readily available, and easily carried. Furthermore, people found that restrictions on travel gave them time to read more paperbacks. [[Four-color printing]] and [[lamination]] developed for military maps made the paperback cover eye catching and kept ink from running as people handled the book. A revolving metal rack, designed to display a wide variety of paperbacks in a small space, found its way into [[pharmacy|drugstore]]s, [[dimestore]]s, and markets. Soldiers received millions of paperback books in [[Armed Services Editions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/09/publishers-gave-away-122951031-books-during-world-war-ii/379893/ |title=Publishers Gave Away 122,951,031 Books During World War II |first=Yoni |last=Appelbaum |date=10 September 2014 |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. paperbacks quickly entered the Canadian market. Canadian mass-market paperback initiatives in the 1940s included White Circle Books, a subsidiary of Collins (U.K.); it was fairly successful but was soon outstripped by the success of [[Harlequin Enterprises|Harlequin]] which began in 1949 and, after a few years of publishing undistinguished novels, focused on the romance genre and became one of the world's largest publishers.

[[McClelland and Stewart]] entered the Canadian mass-market book trade in the early 1960s, with its "Canadian best seller library" series, at a time when Canadian literary culture was beginning to be popularized, and a call for a Canadian author identity was discussed by the Canadian people.

&lt;!-- multiple articles link here; see "What links here" in menu "Toolbox" --&gt;
A mass-market paperback is a small, usually non-illustrated, inexpensive [[bookbinding]] format. This includes the U.K. A-format books of {{convert|110|x|178|mm|in|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="GuardianSize" /&gt; and the U.S. "pocketbook" format books of a similar size. These are generally printed on low quality paper, which discolors and disintegrates over a period of decades.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}} They are commonly released after the [[hardbound|hardback]] edition and often sold in non-traditional bookselling locations such as [[airport novel|airport]]s, [[drugstore]]s, and supermarkets, as well as in traditional [[bookstore]]s.

In 1982, [[romance novel]]s accounted for at least 25% of all paperback sales.&lt;ref name="mcdowell19820110"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/10/books/the-paperback-evolution.html |title=The Paperback Evolution |last=McDowell |first=Edwin |date=1982-01-10 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-03-15 |page=7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, 51% of paperback sales were romance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Romance By The Numbers|url=http://ew.com/article/2014/10/17/romance-numbers/|accessdate=7 May 2018|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many titles, especially in genre fiction, have their [[first edition]]s in paperback and never receive a hardcover printing. This is particularly true of first novels by new authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Flint |first=Eric |url=http://www.baens-universe.com/articles/The_Economics_of_Writing |accessdate=2007-10-17 |title=Column: Salvos Against Big Brother; article: 'The Economics of Writing' |editor=Jim Baen's Universe (e-zine) [[Eric Flint]] (ed.) |quote=[[Mother of Demons]] was published in September 1997, and it was only published in a mass-market paperback edition, as was the standard practice at the time for first novels. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716052311/http://www.baens-universe.com/articles/The_Economics_of_Writing |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business practices by publishers and booksellers also differentiate mass-market paperbacks from hardbacks. When booksellers note that particular books are not selling, they may return them to the publisher for a refund or credit on future orders. However, in the case of mass-market paperbacks, this return usually means stripping the front cover, and returning only the cover for credit, while the remainder of the book is "pulped" (recycled). The copyright page often carries a warning that anyone who buys a [[Stripped book|book missing its front cover]] should assume that the publisher has received no payment and the author has received no [[royalties]] for that copy.

The mass-market paperbacks sold in airport [[newsstand]]s have given rise to the vaguely defined literary genre of the "[[airport novel]]", bought by travelers to read during their potentially long hours of sitting and waiting. Mass-market paperbacks also have offered collections of comic strips and magazine cartoon series, such as [[Ernie Bushmiller]]'s ''[[Nancy (comics)|Nancy]]'' and [[Chon Day]]'s ''[[Brother Sebastian]].''

==={{anchor|bfp}}B-format===
The term B-format indicates a medium-sized paperback of {{convert|129|x|198|mm|in|abbr=on}}. This size has been used to distinguish [[literary novel]]s from [[genre fiction]].&lt;ref name="GuardianSize" /&gt; In the U.S., books of this size are thought of as smaller trade paperbacks (see below).

==={{anchor|trp}}Trade===
&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy]] [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] [[New York Times Best Seller list]] [[The First and Last Freedom]]--&gt;
A trade paperback, sometimes referred to as a "trade paper edition" or just as a "trade", is a higher-quality paperback book. If it is a softcover edition of a previous hardcover edition, and if published by the same publishing house as the hardcover, the text pages are normally identical to the text pages in the hardcover edition, and the book is close to the same size as the hardcover edition. Significantly, the pagination is the same so that references to the text will be unchanged: this is particularly important for reviewers and scholars. The only difference is the soft binding; the paper is usually of higher quality than that of a [[Paperback#Mass-market|mass-market paperback]], for example [[acid-free paper]].

Trade paperbacks are typically priced lower than hardcover books and higher than mass-market paperbacks. Virtually all [[advance copy|advance copies]] sent for promotional and review purposes are issued in trade paperback format. 

In the U.S., the term trade paperback also encompasses the medium-sized paperbacks described as B-format, above. Trade paperbacks are {{convert|135|x|216|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="GuardianSize" /&gt;

====Trade comics====
{{Main|Trade paperback (comics)}}

Trade paperbacks are often used to reprint several issues of a [[Comic book|comic]] series in one volume, usually an important storyline or the entire series itself, and the name "trade paperback" has become synonymous with a collection of reprinted material. [[Graphic novel]]s may also be printed in trade paperback form. Publishers sometimes release popular collections first in a hardback form, followed by a trade paperback months later. Examples include [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' and [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Watchmen]]'' among many others.

[[File:Pomander 3.jpg|thumb|Venetian woman with a pomander]]

A pomander, from [[French language|French]] ''pomme d'ambre'', i.e., apple of amber, is a ball made for perfumes, such as [[ambergris]] (whence the name), [[musk]], or [[civet (perfumery)|civet]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=46}} The pomander was worn or carried in a vase, also known by the same name, as a protection against [[infection]] in times of pestilence or merely as a useful article to modify bad smells.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=46}} The globular cases which contained the pomanders were hung from a neck-chain or belt, or attached to the girdle, and were usually perforated in a variety of [[openwork]] techniques, and made of gold or silver.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=46}} Sometimes they contained several partitions, in each of which was placed a different perfume.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=46}}

The term "pomander" can refer to the scented material itself or to the container that which contains such material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.larsdatter.com/pomanders.htm|title=Pomanders|work=larsdatter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silvercollection.it/dictionarypomander.html POMANDER MEMENTO MORI]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corine Schleif and Volker Schier, ''Katerina's Windows: Donation and Devotion, Art and Music, as Heard and Seen Through the Writings of a Birgittine Nun,'' University Park: Penn State Press, 2009, pp. 237, 242-244&lt;/ref&gt; The container could be made of gold or silver and eventually evolved to be shaped like nuts, skulls, hearts, books and ships. Smaller versions were made to be attached by a chain to a finger ring and held in the hand. Even smaller versions served as cape buttons or rosary beads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ganoksin.com/article/small-wonders-aromatic-adornments/|title=Small Wonders – Aromatic Adornments|publisher= ganoskin|accessdate= 12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pomander can be a bag containing fragrant herbs and might be viewed as an early form of [[aromatherapy]]. Pomanders can be considered related to [[censer]]s, in which aromatics are burned or roasted rather than naturally evaporated.

==History==
Pomanders were first mentioned in literature in the mid-thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/bulletin_of_hispanic_studies/v086/86.1.twomey.html|title=Project MUSE - The Bulletin of Hispanic Studies - Perfumes and perfume-making in the Celestina|work=jhu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used in the late [[Middle Ages]] through the 17th century.&lt;ref name="groom274"&gt;Groom, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;
Also a version of the pomander with oranges, [[clove]]s, oils, and a golden ribbon can be used as a recovery charm in witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hearth-n-home.blogspot.com/2011/12/pomander-recovery-spell-and-charm.html|title=Hearth-n-Home: Pomander Recovery spell and charm|author=Mamma Kay|work=hearth-n-home.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://begumafreedaali.blogspot.com/2013/08/a-magical-pomander.html|title=A-Magical Pomander ~ Begum Afreeda Ali|work=begumafreedaali.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://witcheslore.com/bookofshadows/rituals-spell-casting/magic-and-spell-casting/2537/|title=Magic and Spell-Casting - Witchcraft - Pagan, Wiccan, Occult and Magick|work=witcheslore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spellsofmagic.com/coven_spells.html?coven=6&amp;slist=7|title=Cure Spells|work=SpellsOfMagic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
Pomanders were first made for carrying as religious keepsakes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyotbrothers.com/jewelry-history/jewelry-history-page11.htm Jewelry of the middle ages]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
The ''Archaeological Journal'', Volume 31 of 1874 describes on page 339 a 1584 formula for making a pomander that was also published by [[Frederic Madden]] in his 1831 history book ''Privy purse expenses of the Princess Mary, daughter of [[King Henry the Eighth]], afterwards [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]'' on page 257:

{{Quote|[[Benzoin resin]], [[calamite]], [[labdanum]], and [[storax balsam]] were ground into a powder, dissolved in [[rose water]] and put into a pan over a fire to cook together. The cooked mixture was then removed from the fire, rolled into an apple shape and coated with a powdered mixture of cinnamon, sweet sanders, and cloves.

After this, a concoction was made from three grains each of [[ambergris]], [[deer musk]], and [[civet (perfumery)|civet musk]]. The ambergris was dissolved first and the deer and civet musk mixed in later. The "apple" ball was rolled through the musk concoction to blend in these ingredients and then kneaded to combine and molded back into the shape of an apple.&lt;ref&gt;Longman, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madden, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Nostradamus====
[[Michel de Nostredame]] had a similar method and formula using similar ingredients, but a rather different procedure.

"Rose tablets" were made by soaking a pound of roses without the flower heads in [[deer musk]] water overnight. The water was then thoroughly squeezed out and the roses ground with seven ounces of [[benzoin resin|benzoin]], a quarter of [[ambergris]] and another of [[civet (perfumery)|civet musk]]. This mixture was made into tablets, which were each sandwiched between rose petals and dried in a cool, dark area&lt;ref name=Boeser11&gt;Boeser (chapter 11)&lt;/ref&gt;

To form the final pomander, two ounces of the purest [[labdanum]], an ounce each of [[Styrax]] calamites and benzoin resin, half an ounce of the rose tablets, one ounce of violet powder, and half a [[dram (unit)|dram]] each ambergris and musk were ground into a powder and kneaded with the rose-musk water from the production of the rose tablets. This produced "an aromatic ball of the most supreme perfume, and the longest-lasting that can be made anywhere in the world."&lt;ref name=Boeser11/&gt;

====Pouncet box====
In the late 16th century the pouncet box appeared which, whilst retaining the traditional features of the pomander, was designed to hold liquid perfumes, blended with powder and absorbed on a sponge or piece of cotton. It was favoured by the upper classes who appreciated the delicacy of the liquid perfumes. Its name stemmed from the fact that the box was "pounced" or pierced to release the scent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ganoksin.com/article/small-wonders-aromatic-adornments/|title=Small Wonders – Aromatic Adornments|publisher=Ganoskin|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[File:Orange pomander.jpg|thumb|An orange studded with [[clove]]s.]]

One modern style of pomander is made by studding an orange or other fruit with whole dried [[clove]]s and letting it [[curing (food preservation)|cure dry]], after which it may last several years. This modern pomander serves the functions of perfuming and freshening the air and also of keeping drawers of clothing and linens fresh, pleasant-smelling, and moth-free.

==Culture==
A pomander is worn by [[Mia Farrow|Rosemary Woodhouse]], in [[Roman Polanski]]'s 1968 film, ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''. It figures as a central part of the plot development.

The pouncet box is mentioned in Shakespeare's ''[[Henry IV Part I]]'' when Hotspur is accused of withholding Scottish nobles captured in a skirmish and in self-defence pleads, in describing the King's messenger:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
::He was perfumèd like a milliner,
::And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held
::A pouncet box, which ever and anon
::He gave his nose and took’t away again,
::Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
::Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talked.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Etymology==
Medieval pomander paste formulas usually contained ambergris. From this came "pomme ambre" (amber apple) and from there the word ''pomander'' was developed.&lt;ref name="groom274"/&gt; Other names for the pomander are Ambraapfel, Bisamapfel, Bisamknopf, Bisambüchse, balsam apple, Desmerknopf, musk ball Desmerapfel, Oldanokapsel, Pisambüchse, and smelling apple.

[[File:RichardD'OylyCarte.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Richard D'Oyly Carte]]
'''Richard D'Oyly Carte''' (3 May 1844 – 3 April 1901) was an English talent agent, theatrical [[impresario]], composer and hotelier during the latter half of the [[Victorian era]]. Rising from humble beginnings, Carte built two of London's theatres and a hotel empire, while also establishing an opera company that ran continuously for over a hundred years and a management agency representing some of the most important artists of the day.

Carte started his career working for his father, [[Richard Carte]], in the music publishing and musical instrument manufacturing business. As a young man, he conducted and composed music, but he soon turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency. Carte believed that a school of wholesome, well-crafted, family-friendly, English [[comic opera]] could be as popular as the risqué French works dominating the London musical stage in the 1870s. To that end, he brought together the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] and composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] and, together with his wife [[Helen Carte]], he nurtured their collaboration on a series of thirteen [[Savoy opera]]s. He founded the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] and built the state-of-the-art [[Savoy Theatre]] to host the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas.

Carte also built the [[Savoy Hotel]] in London, and acquired other luxury hotels. In addition, he erected the [[Palace Theatre, London]], which he had intended to be the home of a new school of English [[grand opera]], although this ambition was not realised beyond the production of a single grand opera by Sullivan, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]''. Nevertheless, his partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, and his careful management of their operas and relationship, created a series of works whose success was unprecedented in the history of musical theatre. His opera company, later operated by Helen and then by his son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], and granddaughter, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte|Bridget]], promoted those works for over a century, and they are still performed regularly today.

==Early life==
[[File:Richard-carte.jpg|thumb|left|Carte's father, Richard]]
Carte was born in [[Greek Street]] in the [[West End of London]] on 3 May 1844.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He was the eldest of six children. His father, [[Richard Carte]] (originally Cart; 1808–1891), was a [[flautist]], and his mother was the former Eliza Jones (1814–1885); they had eloped, to the disappointment of her father, Thomas Jones, a clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;Young, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; His siblings were Blanch (1846–1935), Viola (1848–1925), Rose (b. 1854), Henry (1856–1926) and Eliza (1860–1941). Carte was of Welsh and [[Normans|Norman]] ancestry; D'Oyly is a Norman French name which "was a forename (not part of a double surname)".&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32311, "Carte, Richard D'Oyly (1844–1901)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The name comes from his mother's grandmother, Elizabeth D'Oyly, who was a descendant of Peregrine D'Oyly of Overbury Hall in [[Layham]], Suffolk (c. 1625–1667).&lt;/ref&gt; To supplement his income as a performer, Carte's father joined the firm of Rudall, Rose &amp; Co., musical instrument makers and music publishers, in 1850.&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;Burgess, Michael.

==Career==
Between 1868 and 1877, Carte wrote and published the music for a number of his own songs and instrumental works, as well as several comic operas: ''Doctor Ambrosias – His Secret'', at [[St. George's Hall, London|St. George's Hall]] (1868);&lt;ref&gt;"Music and Musicians", ''The Daily News'', 12 April 1895&lt;/ref&gt; ''Marie'', with librettist E.

C. Burnand]], in tandem with English adaptations of two Offenbach pieces, called ''Rose of Auvergne'' and ''Breaking the Spell'', in which Carte's client [[Selina Dolaro]] appeared.&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 5 September 1871, p. 1. The composer's brother, [[Fred Sullivan]], managed the tour and played Cox, while [[Richard Temple (opera singer)|Richard Temple]] played Bouncer, in ''Cox and Box''.&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's musical talent would be helpful later in his career, as he was able to audition singers himself from the pianoforte.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

He took what other people thought were risks, but he felt were certainties. He knew everyone worth knowing... and his practical judgement was as sure as his sense of artistry."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, ''quoted'' in Burgess, Michael. "Richard D'Oyly Carte", ''The Savoyard'', January 1975, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding his opera company===
[[File:Trial by Jury cover.jpg|right|thumb|Programme for ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', 1875]]
In 1874, Carte leased the [[Opera Comique]], a theatre off [[Strand, London|the Strand]], where he presented [[Charles Lecocq]]'s new [[opéra bouffe]] ''[[Giroflé-Girofla]]'', given in French by the company who had premiered the work three months earlier in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;"Opera Comique", ''The Era'', 7 June 1874, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  He followed this with ''The Broken Branch'', an English adaptation of [[Gaston Serpette]]'s ''La branche cassée''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Carte announced his ambitions on the front of the programme for the latter: "It is my desire to establish in London a permanent abode for light Opera."&lt;ref&gt;"Our Representative Man", ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 10 October 1874, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' reported, "Mr D'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager, but a trained musician, and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine opera bouffe, and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment of a higher order, such as a musician might produce with satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 23 August 1874, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte later said it was "the scheme of my life" to found a school of high-quality, family-friendly English comic opera,&lt;ref name="Joseph, p. 11"&gt;Joseph, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the [[wikt:bawdy|bawdy]] [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and adaptations of French operettas that dominated the London musical stage at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 108–09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 128–29&lt;/ref&gt; His experience in writing operettas, however, had convinced him that his own creative talents were inadequate for the task. He later wrote to the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]], "I envy your position but I could never attain it. If I could be an author like you I would certainly not be a manager. I am simply the tradesman who sells your works of art."&lt;ref name=Joseph27&gt;Joseph, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 1874 Carte did not yet have the resources to make his idea into reality, and after his season at the Opera Comique, he terminated his lease.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he arranged for his client, Offenbach, to collaborate with [[H. B. Farnie]] to write a new operetta on the theme of ''[[Dick Whittington and His Cat]]'', which played during the Christmas season at the [[Alhambra Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art and Literary Gossip", ''[[The Manchester Times]]'', 29 August 1874&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gänzl|Gänzl, Kurt]].

In 1875, Carte became the business manager of the [[Royalty Theatre]], under the direction of his client, the popular singing actress Madame [[Selina Dolaro]]. There he programmed Offenbach's ''[[La Périchole]]''. To fill out the evening (as long programmes were the fashion in Victorian theatre), he needed another piece. He remembered a libretto for a one-act [[comic opera]] that W. S. Gilbert had written and shown to him in 1873, called ''[[Trial by Jury]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Sullivan's popular 1867 opera, ''[[Cox and Box]]'', had been revived at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in 1874, and Carte had already asked him to write a piece for the Royalty. Carte knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'' in 1871, and he now suggested that Sullivan could write the music for ''Trial by Jury''.&lt;ref name=Ainger108&gt;Ainger, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, George. "Whose ''Zoo''; or, When Did the ''Trial'' Begin?", ''Nineteenth Century Theatre Research'', 12, December 1984, pp. 39–54&lt;/ref&gt; Because Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of increasing the quality and respectability of English musical theatre, and so broadening its audience through the promotion of well-crafted English light operas, Carte gave them wider authority as director and music director than was customary at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Vorder Bruegge, Andrew.

Carte managed the first tour of ''Trial by Jury'', which stopped at the Theatre Royal in [[Dublin]], Ireland, in September 1875. While there, he met a young Scottish actress, Susan Couper Black, who used the stage name [[Helen Lenoir]]. She became fascinated by his vision for establishing a company to promote English [[comic opera]]&lt;ref name="Ainger, p. 111"/&gt; and gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation as his secretary.&lt;ref name=Joseph134&gt;Joseph, pp. 134–35&lt;/ref&gt; Well-educated, with an organisational ability, business acumen, focus on detail and diplomatic skills that surpassed even Carte's, Lenoir gradually became intensely involved in all of his business affairs. Carte and Lenoir married in 1888, three years after the death of his first wife.&lt;ref name=helenDNB&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59169, "Carte, Helen (1852–1913)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/59169}} accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 111–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the initial production of ''Trial by Jury'', however, Carte continued to produce continental operetta, touring in the summer of 1876 with a repertoire consisting of English adaptations of French opera bouffe (Offenbach’s ''La Périchole'', and ''[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein]]'', Lecocq's ''[[La fille de Madame Angot]]'' and [[Léon Vasseur]]'s ''La Timbale d'argent''), paired with two one-act English after-pieces (''Happy Hampstead'' and ''Trial by Jury''). Carte acted as the musical director of this travelling company that included [[W.H. Denny]].&lt;ref name=whowaswho/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 4 July 1876, p. 6; ''The Freeman's Journal'' (Dublin), 28 July 1876, p. 1; and ''The Era'', 23 July 1876, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wachs, Kevin.

Encouraged by the success of ''Trial by Jury'', Carte made attempts in 1875–76 to raise money for either a revival of ''Thespis'' or a new piece.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 113 and 119&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he finally found four backers and formed the "Comedy Opera Company" to produce the future works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], along with the works of other British author/composer teams.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; This allowed Carte to lease the Opera Comique and to give Gilbert and Sullivan firm terms for a new opera.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 130–31&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Helen Lenoir had been promoted from Carte's secretary to his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; The first comic opera produced by the new company was Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' in 1877, with a plot involving a tradesmanlike London magician and his patented love potion. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte were able to select their own cast, instead of using the players under contract to the theatre where the work was produced, as had been the case with their earlier works. They chose talented actors, few of whom were well-known stars, and Carte's agency provided many of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 111; Ainger, pp. 133–34&lt;/ref&gt; The reception of the piece showed that Carte had been right: there was a promising future in family-friendly English comic opera.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 141–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 113–14&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sorcerer'' was followed by ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' in 1878. Business for the new opera was slow at first.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's investors in the Comedy Opera Company advocated cutting their losses and closing the show.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; After promotional efforts by Carte and Sullivan, who included some of the ''Pinafore'' music in several [[promenade concert]]s at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], ''Pinafore'' became a hit.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Carte persuaded Gilbert and Sullivan that when their original agreement with the Comedy Opera Company expired in July 1879, a business partnership among the three of them would be to their advantage.&lt;ref name=joseph18&gt;Joseph, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The three each put up £1,000 and formed a new partnership under the name "[[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|Mr Richard D'Oyly Carte's Opera Company]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 162–67&lt;/ref&gt; Under the partnership agreement, once the expenses of mounting the productions had been deducted, each of the three men was entitled to one third of the profits.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

On 31 July 1879, the last day of their agreement with Carte, the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the ''Pinafore'' set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 170–72&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery and props.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 170–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-opcom.html "The Fracas at the Opera Comique",] ''The Theatre'', 1 September 1879, reprinted at the Stage Beauty website, accessed 6 May 2009.

''H.M.S.

To try to counter this [[copyright infringement|copyright piracy]] and make some money from the popularity of their opera in America, Carte travelled to New York with the authors and the company to present an "authentic" production of ''Pinafore'' there, beginning in December 1879, as well as American tours.&lt;ref name=Ainger182&gt;Ainger, pp. 182–83&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's assistant, Helen Lenoir, who became his wife in 1888, made fifteen visits to America in the 1880s and 1890s to promote Carte's interests, superintending arrangements for American productions and tours of each of the new Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=helenDNB/&gt; Beginning with ''Pinafore'', Carte licensed the [[J.

In an effort to head off unauthorised American productions of their next opera, ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Carte and his partners opened it in New York on 31 December 1879, prior to its 1880 London premiere.&lt;ref name=Ainger182/&gt; They hoped to forestall further "piracy" by establishing the authorised production and tours in America before others could copy it and by delaying publication of the score and libretto.

Carte had been planning to build a new theatre for several years to promote English comic opera and, in particular, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=savoyard&gt;"100 Electrifying Years", ''The Savoyard'', Volume XX no. 2, D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust, September 1981, pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 172–72&lt;/ref&gt; With profits from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency, he bought property along the Strand in 1880 with frontage onto the Thames Embankment, where he built the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1881. Carte chose the name in honour of the [[Savoy Palace]], which had been built on the site in the thirteenth century by [[Peter of Savoy, Earl of Richmond|Peter, Count of Savoy]]. It later passed to [[John of Gaunt]] but was destroyed in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The Savoy Theatre was a state-of-the-art facility, setting a new standard for technology, comfort and decor. It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; and seated nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).&lt;ref&gt;[[J. P.

''Patience'' was the first production at the new theatre, transferring there on 10 October 1881.

At that performance, Carte stepped on stage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of the new technology.&lt;ref name=bettany&gt;Bettany, unnumbered page (there are no page numbers in the book)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' concluded that the theatre "is admirably adapted for its purpose, its acoustic qualities are excellent, and all reasonable demands of comfort and taste are complied with."&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 11 October 1881, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Strand, including the Savoy Theatre, and a depiction of Richard D'Oyly Carte, are featured in [[Nicholas Meyer]]'s 1976 novel ''[[The West End Horror]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Carte and his manager, [[George Edwardes]] (later famous as manager of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]), introduced several innovations at the theatre including free programme booklets, the orderly "queue" system with numbered tickets for the pit and gallery (an American idea), tea served at the interval and a policy of no tipping for [[cloakroom]] or other services.&lt;ref name=bettany/&gt; Daily expenses at the theatre were about half the possible takings from ticket sales.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dark and Grey, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The last eight of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas were premiered at the Savoy, and all of their operas came to be known as [[Savoy opera]]s.

===Peak years for the opera company===
During the years when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written, Richard D'Oyly Carte also produced operas and plays by other writing teams, as well as other works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas. Many of these were [[Savoy opera#Companion pieces|companion pieces]] to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, as the Victorian audiences preferred long evenings in the theatre. Some, however, were new full-length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte's touring companies, which toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and these new works, extensively. Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency. As an example of their level of activity, an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of ''Patience'' in London and its 100th performance in New York states that, in addition to these two productions of ''Patience'', Carte was simultaneously producing many other projects. These included two companies touring with ''Patience'', two touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, one touring with the operetta ''[[Olivette (opera)|Olivette]]'' (co-produced with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]]), one with ''[[Claude Duval (opera)|Claude Duval]]'' in America, a production of ''Youth'' running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of ''Patience'', ''Pirates'', ''Claude Duval'' and ''[[Billee Taylor]]'' in association with [[J. C. Williamson]] in Australia, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091001081006/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/museum/patience/250perf/pc250.html 250th Anniversary ''Patience'' programme, 1881]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte also introduced the practice of licensing amateur theatrical societies to present works for which he held the rights, increasing the works' popularity and the sales of scores and libretti, as well as the rental of band parts.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 81 and 163.&lt;/ref&gt; This had an important influence on amateur theatre in general. Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the [[Savoy opera]]s, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur societies "support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites."&lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to "the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas".&lt;ref name="Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394"&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] was founded in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan operas that year.&lt;ref name="Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394"/&gt;

After ''Patience'', Carte produced ''[[Iolanthe]]'', which opened in 1882. During its run, in February 1883, Carte signed a five-year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, obliging them to create new operas for him upon six months' notice.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan had not intended to immediately write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882 and must have felt the long-term contract necessary for his security.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 217–19&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, "Effectively, [the contract] made [Gilbert and Sullivan] Carte's employees – a situation which created its own resentments."&lt;ref name=Crowthcarpet&gt;Crowther, Andrew. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/quarrel.html "The Carpet Quarrel Explained",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023151629/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/quarrel.html |date=23 October 2010 }} ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', 28 June 1997, accessed 7 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership's next opera, ''[[Princess Ida]]'', opened in January 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 225–26&lt;/ref&gt; Carte soon saw that ''Ida'' was running weakly at the box office and invoked the agreement to call upon his partners to write a new opera. The musical establishment constantly pressured Sullivan to abandon comic opera in favour of serious music,&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The Times'', 27 May 1878, p. 6, favourably reviewing ''H.M.S. Pinafore'', nevertheless added, "we cannot suppress a word of regret that the composer on whom before all others the chances of a national school of music depend should confine himself ... to a class of production which, however attractive, is hardly worthy of the efforts of an accomplished and serious artist."&lt;/ref&gt; and after he was knighted in 1883, the pressure only increased. He soon regretted having signed the five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1884, Sullivan told Carte that "it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself."&lt;ref name=Crowthcarpet/&gt;

During this conflict and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners' differences using a mixture of friendship and business acumen.&lt;ref name=Joseph27/&gt; Sullivan asked to be released from the partnership on several occasions.&lt;ref name=jacobssullivan&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26772?docPos=7 "Sullivan, Arthur Seymour",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Carte was able to coax eight comic operas out of his partners in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ''Pirates'' premiered on 31 December 1879, so technically it's seven, but Joseph counts it as eight. --&gt; When ''Princess Ida'' closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, for the first time in the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready. Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 230–33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|left|Lithograph from ''The Mikado'']]
Carte produced the first revival of ''The Sorcerer'', together with ''Trial by Jury'', and matinees of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' played by a cast of children, while he waited for his partners to finish writing the new work. This became the partnership's most successful opera, ''[[The Mikado]]'', which opened in March 1885.&lt;ref name=Wilson13&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The piece satirised British institutions by setting them in a fictional Japan and took advantage of the Victorian craze for the exotic and "picturesque" Far East.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian. "Japan in London 1885", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', issue 22, Winter 2007, pp. 686–96&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Mikado'' became the partnership's longest-running hit, lasting for 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, and supplanting ''Patience'' as the second-longest-running work of musical theatre up to that time.&lt;ref name=Longest/&gt; It was extraordinarily popular in the US and worldwide and remains the most frequently performed Savoy Opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bradley|first=Ian|url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/hrgsp/old/productions/mik97/mik97hist.htm |title=Note on the popularity of '&amp;#39;The Mikado'&amp;#39; |publisher=Hcs.harvard.edu |accessdate=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John.]] [http://www.musicals101.com/gilbert3.htm "G&amp;S101: G&amp;S Story: Part III"], Musicals101.com, accessed 8 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The partnership's next opera was ''[[Ruddigore]]'', which opened in January 1887. The piece, though a financial success, was a relative disappointment after the extraordinary run of ''The Mikado''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Ruddigore'' closed after nine months, Carte mounted revivals of earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas at the Savoy for almost a year. After another attempt by Gilbert to persuade Sullivan to set a "lozenge plot", Gilbert met his collaborator half way by writing a serio-comic plot for ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', which premiered in October 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; The opera ran for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions. This was a happy time for Carte, with a long-running opera, new marriage and new hotel and opera house under construction.&lt;ref name=Wilson13/&gt; When Carte asked his partners for a new work, Sullivan again expressed reluctance to write another comic opera, asking if Gilbert would write a "dramatic work on a larger musical scale".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert declined but offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted: the two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan could work on a [[grand opera]] that Carte would produce at a new theatre he was planning to build to present British grand opera.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; The new comic opera was ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', which opened in December 1889 and became one of the partnership's greatest successes.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years, Carte was not just the manager of the theatre. He was a full participant in the producing partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, involved in casting and finding designers; in charge of publicity; directing and hiring designers for the non-Gilbert works, including the many companion pieces (sometimes with the help of assistants);&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; and casting, directing and rehearsing the touring companies, among other duties.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henry Lytton]], "Mr. Carte was a great stage manager. He could take in the details of a scene with one sweep of his eagle eye and say unerringly just what was wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Lytton, Henry. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html ''Secrets of a Savoyard''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706175513/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html |date=6 July 2008 }} (1922), chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of Carte's productions created a national and international taste for them, and he sent touring companies throughout the British provinces, to America (generally managed by Helen), Europe&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Bentley/&gt; [[Queen Victoria]] honoured the company by calling for a [[Royal Command Performance]] of ''The Gondoliers'' at [[Windsor Castle]] in 1891. Following the libretto closely, she noticed additions to the text made by some of the actors and asked Carte to explain why this was done. Carte replied that they "are what we call 'gags'". The queen answered that she had always understood that "gags were things that were put by authority into people's mouths." Carte rejoined, "These gags, Your Majesty, are things people put into their own mouths without authority."&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], writing in ''[[The World (journal)|The World]]'' in October 1893, stated:

===End of the partnership and last years===
[[File:Ivanhoe-programme.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' programme cover]]
On 22 April 1890, during the run of ''The Gondoliers'', Gilbert discovered that maintenance expenses for the theatre, including a new £500&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&amp;use%5B%5D=DEFIND&amp;use%5B%5D=WAGE&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPCP&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPC&amp;year_early=1890&amp;pound71=500&amp;shilling71=&amp;pence71=&amp;amount=500&amp;year_source=1890&amp;year_result=2006 |title=Approximately £37,818.60 in 2006 prices |access-date=19 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714064621/http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&amp;use%5B%5D=DEFIND&amp;use%5B%5D=WAGE&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPCP&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPC&amp;year_early=1890&amp;pound71=500&amp;shilling71=&amp;pence71=&amp;amount=500&amp;year_source=1890&amp;year_result=2006 |archive-date=14 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; carpet for the front lobby of the theatre, were being charged to the partnership instead of borne by Carte. Gilbert angrily confronted Carte, but Carte refused to reconsider the accounts. Even though the amount of the charge was not great, Gilbert felt that it was a moral issue involving Carte's integrity, and he could not look past it. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that "I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen".&lt;ref name=Crowthcarpet/&gt; Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte "in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial."&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Matters deteriorated further, and Gilbert brought a lawsuit. Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building the [[Palace Theatre, London|Royal English Opera House]], the inaugural production of which was to be Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Gilbert won the dispute and felt vindicated, but his actions had been hurtful to his partners, and the partnership disbanded.&lt;ref name=Vowed&gt;Shepherd, Marc. "Introduction: Historical Context", ''The Grand Duke'', p. vii, New York: Oakapple Press, 2009.

Carte's first production at the Royal English Opera House was of Sullivan's only grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'', which opened in January 1891. It played for an initial run of 155 performances, a record for an opera, but no other operas shared the new opera house with it. Instead, ''Ivanhoe'' was presented every night with alternating casts. When ''Ivanhoe'' finally closed in July, Carte had no new work ready to play at the opera house, and so it had to close. The opera house re-opened in November 1891 with [[André Messager]]'s ''[[La Basoche]]'' at first alternating in repertory with ''Ivanhoe'', and then ''La Basoche'' played alone, closing in January 1892.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Carte again had no new opera to present at the house, and the venture soon failed. [[Henry J. Wood|Sir Henry Wood]], who had been [[répétiteur]] for the production, recalled in his autobiography, "If D'Oyly Carte had had a repertory of six operas instead of only one, I believe he would have established English opera in London for all time. Towards the end of the run of ''Ivanhoe'' I was already preparing ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' with [[Eugène Oudin]] in the name part. He would have been superb. However, plans were altered and the ''Dutchman'' was shelved."&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Henry.

[[File:Glad to See You Together.png|thumb|220px|left|The ''Entr'acte'' expresses its pleasure that Gilbert and Sullivan are reunited.]]
Because of the carpet quarrel, Gilbert had vowed to write no more for the Savoy.&lt;ref name=Vowed/&gt; When ''The Gondoliers'' closed in 1891, Carte needed new authors and composers to write works for the Savoy Theatre. He turned to old friends [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance]], [[Frank Desprez]] and [[Edward Solomon]] for his next piece, ''[[The Nautch Girl]]'', which ran for a satisfying 200 performances in 1891–92. Carte then revived Solomon and [[Sydney Grundy]]'s ''[[The Vicar of Bray (opera)|The Vicar of Bray]]'', which ran through the summer of 1892. Next came Grundy and Sullivan's ''[[Haddon Hall]]'', which held the stage until April 1893.&lt;ref name=joseph111&gt;Joseph, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; While Carte presented new pieces and revivals at the Savoy, his touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America. In 1894, for example, Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America.&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoyards on Tour", ''The Sketch'', 13 June 1894, pp. 373–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert's aggressive, though successful, legal action had embittered Carte and Sullivan, but the partnership had been so profitable that Carte and his wife eventually sought to reunite the author and composer. After several attempts by the Cartes, the reconciliation finally came through the efforts of [[Chappell &amp; Co.|Tom Chappell]], who published the sheet music to their operas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Wolfson| first=John| year=1976| title=Final curtain: The last Gilbert and Sullivan Operas|page=7 |publisher=Chappell in association with A. Deutsch| location=London | ISBN=0-903443-12-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, Gilbert and Sullivan produced their penultimate collaboration, ''[[Utopia, Limited]]''. While ''Utopia'' was being prepared, Carte produced ''[[Jane Annie]]'', by [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], with music by [[Ernest Ford]]. Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing after only 51 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Tillett, Selwyn.

[[File:Comic Opera at the Savoy.png|right|thumb|[[George Grossmith]] comforts Carte after failure of ''[[The Grand Duke]]'']]
''Utopia'' was Carte's most expensive production to date, but it ran for a comparatively disappointing 245 performances, until June 1894.&lt;ref name=joseph111/&gt; Carte then played first ''[[Mirette (opera)|Mirette]]'', composed by [[André Messager]], then ''[[The Chieftain]]'', by [[Francis Burnand|F. C. Burnand]] and Sullivan. These ran for 102 and 97 performances, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; The company then toured the London suburbs, and the theatre was dark during the summer of 1895, reopening in November for a revival of ''[[The Mikado]]''.&lt;ref name=Wilson52&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1896 by ''[[The Grand Duke]]'', which ran for 123 performances and was Gilbert and Sullivan's only financial failure. ''The Gondoliers'' turned out to be Gilbert and Sullivan's last big hit, and after ''The Grand Duke'', the two men never collaborated again.&lt;ref name=joseph111/&gt; At the Savoy, Carte produced ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'' (1897), ''[[The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein]]'' (1897), ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'' (1898) and ''[[The Lucky Star]]'' (1899), as well as revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=Wilson52/&gt;

Though the 1890s brought Carte more disappointments than hits in the theatre, his hotel business prospered and grew. He acquired [[Simpson's-in-the-Strand]]&lt;ref name=savoy&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021221064512/http://www.the-savoy-group.com/Simpsons/AboutUs/History/history.asp The Savoy Group, history pages, Simpson's-in-the-Strand], accessed 1 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Claridge's]] Hotel, both of which he entirely rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claridges.co.uk/page.aspx?id=1846 The Savoy Group, history pages, Claridge's], accessed 1 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There was one grave setback, in 1897, when he had to dismiss his manager, Ritz, and his star chef, Escoffier, for financial misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;Brigid, Allen.

He was determined to engage M. Joseph, proprietor of the Marivaux Restaurant in Paris, then at the height of its fame. Carte was seriously ill, but he insisted on being carried to the boat-train. In Paris he bought the Marivaux and returned with Joseph to the Savoy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Mirror]]'', 10 June 1904, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

She profitably managed the theatre and the provincial touring companies.&lt;ref name=helenDNB/&gt; In 1894, Carte had hired his son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], as an assistant.

Carte was married twice. His first wife was Blanche Julia Prowse (1853–1885), the daughter of [[Keith Prowse|William Prowse]], a piano manufacturer, music publisher and booking agent. As a teenager, she had participated in amateur theatricals with Carte.&lt;ref name=Ainger75/&gt; They married in 1870&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and had two sons, Lucas (1872–1907) and [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]].&lt;ref name=j132&gt;Joseph, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Blanche died of pneumonia in 1885,&lt;ref name=j132/&gt; and in 1888, Carte married his assistant, [[Helen Carte|Helen]].&lt;ref name=Joseph134/&gt; Their wedding took place in the [[Savoy Chapel]], with [[Arthur Sullivan]] as the best man.&lt;ref name=goodman&gt;Goodman, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert received training in an accounting firm and then became his father's assistant in 1894. Lucas, who was not involved in the family businesses, became a [[barrister]]. He was appointed Private Secretary to [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Charles Russell]] in 1899 in connection with the [[Schomburgk Line|Venezuelan boundary arbitration]] in Paris. There he contracted [[tuberculosis]] and later died of that disease at the age of 34.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas was born on 27 December 1872 and was educated at [[Winchester College]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He was called to the bar in 1897. After he contracted tuberculosis, he worked for the rest of his life on issues relating to the disease and died on 18 January 1907. See Obituary of Lucas D'Oyly Carte, ''The Times'', 22 January 1907, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte's London house was at the [[Adelphi, London|Adelphi]], not far from the Savoy.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Passionate about the visual arts as well as the performing arts, Carte invited his friend, the artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James McNeill Whistler]], to decorate the house. Whistler had the entire billiard room painted the colour of the billiard cloth, and elsewhere painted his favourite yellow with his own hand.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally enthusiastic for technological innovation, Carte installed a lift, the first in a private house in England.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1890, he bought a small island in the [[River Thames]], between [[Weybridge]] and [[Shepperton]], called Folly Eyot, which he renamed [[D'Oyly Carte Island]]. He wanted to use the island as an annex to his new [[Savoy Hotel]], but the local authorities refused to grant him a drinks licence for the property.&lt;ref&gt;Barrington, Rutland (1908). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dT1AAAAAIAAJ ''Rutland Barrington: A Record of 35 Years' Experience on the English Stage, By Himself''], p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he built Eyot House, a large house and garden on the island, that he used as a residence.&lt;ref&gt;Pauling, Keith. [http://www.thamespathway.com/chapter10/richard-doyly-carte.aspx "Richard D’Oyly Carte"], ''Thames Pathway: Journal of a Walk Down the River Thames'', 2009 {{ISBN|1445222396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riverthames.co.uk/about_thames/3763.htm "Shepperton Lock",] ''About the Thames'', accessed 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Carte displayed his macabre sense of humour by keeping a crocodile on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 124. Baily speculates that Carte's sense of humour was a bond with Gilbert just as his "cultured musical mind" was a bond with Sullivan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Richard DOyly Carte Grave.JPG|right|upright|thumb|Carte's grave at St Andrews Church, Fairlight]]
Carte died at his London home from [[dropsy]] and heart disease in 1901, just short of his 57th birthday.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=R. D'Oyly Carte is Dead. The Famous Theatrical Manager Had Long Been an Invalid.

A memorial service was held at the Chapel Royal of the Savoy, where a memorial stained glass window was later dedicated to him.&lt;ref name=goodman/&gt; He left an estate valued at £250,000.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This sum is equivalent to more than £100,000,000 in 2007 values: see [http://www.measuringworth.com measuring worth.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte was instrumental in bringing the British theatre from its low status in the mid-Victorian age to a position of respectable eminence, with knighthoods for actors, such as [[Henry Irving]], and for dramatists, including Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 128 ''quoting'' Gilbert, describing mid-19th century productions as "crude, unintelligent, and sometimes frankly improper"&lt;/ref&gt; George Bernard Shaw wrote of Carte's theatrical legacy, "Mr D'Oyly Carte founded a new school of English comic opera; raised operatic inscenation to the rank of a fine art; and finally built a new English Opera House and made a magnificent effort to do for English grand opera what he had done for comic opera."&lt;ref&gt;''The World'', 2 August 1893, ''quoted'' in Laurence, p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; In Carte's obituary, ''[[The Times]]'' noted, "By his refined taste he raised the reputation of the ''mise en scène'' of the Savoy operas to a very high pitch. He set a high standard".&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; Beyond this, however, Carte's influence, through the production of the Savoy operas, heavily influenced the course of the [[Cultural influence of Gilbert and Sullivan#Musical theatre|development of modern musical theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Bargainnier, Earl F. "W. S. Gilbert and American Musical Theatre", pp. 120–33, ''American Popular Music: Readings from the Popular Press'' by Timothy E.

Carte was also a prime mover in making hotels respectable and respected: in the words of the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'': "Led by the prince of Wales [the Savoy] became the meeting place for London high society and the ''nouveaux riches'' of the British empire.... [The] food and the ambience lured people from the clubs to dine in public and give great parties there. It allowed ladies, hitherto fearful of dining in public, to be seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms."&lt;ref&gt;Ashburner, F.[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50441 "Escoffier, Georges Auguste (1846–1935)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2006, accessed 17 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DOCplanter.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Planter in the Embankment Gardens behind the [[Savoy Hotel]]]]
Carte left the theatre, opera company, hotels and his other business interests to Helen.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy Operas in Britain and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 111–27&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 she leased the Savoy Theatre to [[William Greet]], overseeing his management of a revival of ''Iolanthe'' and several new comic operas.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert became chairman of the [[Savoy Hotel]] by 1903, which Helen continued to own.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1906, Helen staged a Gilbert and Sullivan repertory season at the Savoy Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; The season, and the following one, which were both directed by Gilbert, earned excellent reviews and sold well, revitalising the company. After the second repertory season concluded in 1909, however, the company did not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 138 and 186&lt;/ref&gt;

At her death in 1913, Helen passed the family businesses to Carte's son, Rupert. He maintained the hotel business, disposing of the Grand Hotel in Rome, but expanding the group in London.&lt;ref name=profit/&gt; The Savoy Group remained under the control of the Carte family and its associates until 1994.&lt;ref name=billions&gt;Prynn, Jonathan.

Rupert D'Oyly Carte refreshed the opera company's productions and added London seasons, beginning in 1919, as well as provincial and foreign tours.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 160 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 Rupert died, leaving a strong company to his daughter [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 273–74&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became too much for the company. Bridget was forced to close the company in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond, and Carte's vision of wholesome light operas that celebrate Great Britain endures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bradley | first = Ian| authorlink=Ian Bradley|title = Oh Joy!

[[File:Godward-The Mirror-1899.jpg|thumb|180px|''The Mirror'' (1899) by [[John William Godward]]]]
'''Sheer fabric''' is [[textile|fabric]] which is made using thin [[Thread (unit of measurement)|thread]] and/or low density of [[knits|knit]] and which results in a semi-[[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] and flimsy cloth. Some fabrics become [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] when wet. 

==Overview==
The sheerness of a fabric is expressed as a numerical [[Denier (measure)|denier]] which ranges from 3 (extremely rare, very thin, barely visible) to 15 (standard sheer for stockings) up to 30 (semi opaque) until 100 (opaque). The materials which can be made translucent include [[Gossamer (fabric)|gossamer]], [[silk]], [[rayon]] or [[nylon]]. Sheer fabric comes in a wide variety of colors, but for curtains, white and shades of white, such as cream, winter white, eggshell, and ivory are popular. In some cases, sheer fabric is embellished with embroidered patterns or designs.

[[File:Chorwacja, widok z wyspy Ciovo na wyspę Solta.JPG|thumb|right|Sheer curtains]]
[[Image:Pantyhose2.jpg|thumb|right|Sheer [[pantyhose]] made from nylon]]

A common use for sheer fabric is in curtains, which allows for sunlight to pass through during daylight, while maintaining a level of privacy. Due to the loose weave in sheer fabrics curtains offer little heat insulation. However, when it is lighter on the inside of a room than it is on the outside (such as at nighttime), then the inside of the room can be seen from the outside.

Sheer fabric is used in clothing, in garments such as stockings or tights and in dancewear and lingerie, and sometimes as part of clothing, such as in [[wedding gown]]s and formal costumes. Sheer fabric for clothing offers very little in the way of warmth for the wearer, and for this reason is commonly worn in hot weather. It offers relatively low [[Sun protective clothing|sun protection]].

Though sheer stockings have been popular since the 1920s, and have been used in women's nightwear for some time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seriously Sensual|url=https://www.seriouslysensual.co.uk/nightwear/|website=Nightwear|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the use of sheer fabrics in other clothing has become more common in recent years. There was a predominant sheer fashion trend in fashion circles since 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.theage.com.au/2010/02/15/1123369/600-GALL-BEGG-SS7-600x400.jpg The Age: 15/2/10 - 2010 Allan Border Medal]&lt;/ref&gt; with sheer fabrics being used in tight clothes, layers, and in delicate feminine draping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionising.com/trends/b--Sheer-fashion-trend-2009-2010-953.html Sheer fashion trend: 2009 &amp; 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{maplink|frame=y|frame-align=left|zoom=12|type=shape|id=Q461572|text=Location in New York City}}

===Boundaries===
Because of the nature of neighborhoods in New York City,{{refn|group=notes|Neighborhoods in New York City do not have official status, and their boundaries are not specifically set by the city, although the boundaries of related areas, such as zoning districts and historic districts are set and specific. Because of this, the definition of where neighborhoods begin and end is subject to a variety of forces, including the efforts of real estate concerns to promote certain areas, the use of neighborhood names in media news reports, and the everyday usage of people.&lt;ref&gt;Scherzer, Kenneth A. "neighborhoods" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, pp.886-87. Quote: "Most neighborhoods in New York have a generally recognized central district, but their boundaries are difficult to define, especially if the population is transient and heterogeneous, the neighborhood is centrally situated, or the question of boundaries is politically sensitive ... Perceptions play a large role in shaping the evolution of neighborhoods: areas that are perceived as desirable tend to grow and prosper, which in turn makes them more desirable. At the same time the boundaries of a prosperous neighborhood inevitably expands, which serves the interests of residents of adjoining areas, of real estate brokers and speculators, and sometimes of government. A similar process works in reverse to the detriment of declining neighborhoods.  Sometimes neighborhoods are renamed in an effort to improve their image."&lt;/ref&gt;}} different sources will often give different boundaries for each one. In the case of SoHo, all sources appear to agree that the northern boundary is [[Houston Street]], and the southern boundary is [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], but the location of the eastern and western boundaries is disputed.

In 1974, shortly after SoHo first came into existence, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the boundaries as "stretching from Houston to Canal Streets between [[West Broadway]] and [[Lafayette Street]]"&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, Wendy (November 24, 1974) [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1974/11/24/91085427.pdf "SoHo a 'Victim of its Own Success'"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; – a definition it continued to hold to in 2016&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, Aileen (April 27, 2016) [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/realestate/living-in-soho-chic-stores-and-cobblestones.html?_r=0 "SoHo: Chic Stores and Cobblestones"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; – but ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'' reports that SoHo is bounded by Crosby Street on the east, and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] to the west.&lt;ref name=enc-nyc&gt;Gold, Joyce. "SoHo" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, pp.1202-03&lt;/ref&gt; These are the same boundaries shown by [[Google Maps]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/maps/place/SoHo,+New+York,+NY/@40.7236447,-74.0050567,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2598c5e51e2f3:0xce2f3449f490f818!8m2!3d40.723301!4d-74.0029883 "Soho, Manhattan"] [[Google Maps]]". Accessed: April 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''[[AIA Guide to New York City]]'' gives the western boundary of SoHo north of [[Broome Street]] as being West Broadway,&lt;ref name=aia /&gt; and ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine gives the eastern boundary as Lafayette Street and the western boundary as the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff [http://nymag.com/realestate/articles/neighborhoods/soho.htm "Neighborhood Profile: SoHo"] ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''. Accessed: April 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The very small-scale map at the Community Board 2 profile page on New York City's official website appears to show Sixth Avenue and Lafayette Street as the western and eastern boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/community/community-portal-1.page?cd=mn02 "Community Portal: Manhattan Community District 2"] nyc.gov. Accessed: April 18, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Summing up these sources, the western boundary of SoHo may be the Hudson River, Sixth Avenue or West Broadway, and the eastern boundary may be Crosby Street or Lafayette Street.

In the 1990s, real estate agents began giving an adjacent neighborhood below West Houston Street various appellations, with no general agreement on whether it should be called West SoHo, [[Hudson Square]] or the [[South Village]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Clare. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/15/realestate/living-in-west-soho-eschewing-a-name-and-becoming-an-address.html "Living in: West SoHo; Eschewing a Name and Becoming an Address"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' (August 15, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''AIA Guide'' calls that neighborhood "An intersection of brick and glass, searching for an identity", and refers to the western section of it as "The Glass Box District".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite aia5}}, p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic District===
The SoHo–Cast Iron Historic District is contained within the zoned SoHo neighborhood. Originally ending in the west at the eastern side of West Broadway and to the east at the western side of Crosby Street, the SoHo–Cast Iron Historic District was expanded in 2010 to cover most of West Broadway and to extend east to Lafayette and Centre Streets. The boundary lines are not straight, and some block-fronts on West Broadway and Lafayette are excluded from the District.&lt;ref&gt;[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] [http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/maps/sohodextmap.pdf "SoHo–Cast Iron Historic District Extension Map"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Designation Report, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early years===
During the colonial period, the land that is now SoHo was part of a grant of farmland given to freed slaves of the [[Dutch West Indies Company]], and the site of the first free Black settlement on Manhattan island.&lt;ref name=desrep4&gt;Designation Report, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; This land was acquired in the 1660s by Augustine Hermann, and then passed to his brother-in-law, Nicholas Bayard.&lt;ref name=desrep4 /&gt; The estate was confiscated by the state as a result of Bayard's part in [[Leisler's Rebellion]], but was returned to him after the sentence was annulled.&lt;ref name=desrep5&gt;Designation Report, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century natural barriers&amp;nbsp;– streams and hills&amp;nbsp;– impeded the growth of the city northward into the Bayard estate, and the area maintained its rural character.&lt;ref name=desrep5 /&gt; During the [[American Revolution]], the area was the location of numerous [[fortification]]s, [[redoubt]]s and [[breastwork (fortification)|breastwork]]s.&lt;ref name=desrep5 /&gt; After the war, Bayard, who had suffered financially because of it, was forced to mortgage some of the property, which was divided up into lots, but even then there was very little development in the area, aside from some manufacturing at Broadway and Canal Street.&lt;ref name=desrep5 /&gt;

Serious development of the area did not begin until the Common Council, answering the complaints of landowners in the area, drained the [[Collect Pond]], which had once been an important source of fresh water for the island, but which had become polluted and rank and a breeding ground for mosquitoes. A canal was built to drain the pond into the Hudson, and the canal and pond were both later filled in using earth from nearby Bayard's Hill.&lt;ref name=desrep5 /&gt; Once Broadway was paved and sidewalks were built there and along Canal Street, more people began to make their homes there, joining earlier arrivals such as [[James Fennimore Cooper]].&lt;ref name=desrep5 /&gt;

==={{anchor|decline}} Commerce, entertainment, and decline===
By the mid-19th century, the early [[Federal architecture|Federal]]- and [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]]-style homes were replaced by more-solid structures of masonry and cast iron, and along Broadway, large marble-skinned commercial establishments began to open, such as [[Lord &amp; Taylor]], [[Arnold Constable &amp; Company]] and [[Tiffany &amp; Company]], as well as grand hotels such as the St. Nicholas and the Metropolitan.&lt;ref name=desrep6&gt;Designation Report. p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Theatres followed in their wake, and Broadway between Canal and [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston]] Streets became a lively theater and shopping district and the entertainment center of New York;&lt;ref name=desrep6 /&gt; as usual with such areas, it was home to many brothels as well,&lt;ref name="Ephemeral New York"&gt;{{Cite web| title = West Broadway: once a slum called 'Rotten Row' | work=Ephemeral New York | date = 2011-03-16 | url = http://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/west-broadway-once-a-slum-called-rotten-row/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the side streets off of Broadway became the city's [[red-light district]].&lt;ref name=desrep6 /&gt; As this change in character drove out the middle-class, their place was taken by small manufacturing concerns, including cabinet-makers and the lumberyards that supplied them, brass and copper firms, makers of china and glassware, locksmiths, snuff manufacturers and book publishers.&lt;ref name=desrep7&gt;Designation Report, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

This dramatic shift in the nature of the neighborhood continued to drive out residents, and between 1860 and 1865 the Eighth Ward, which included the SoHo area, lost 25% of its population.&lt;ref name=desrep7 /&gt; After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Panic of 1873]], in the 1880s and 90s, large manufacturers began to move into the area, especially textile firms, and the area became the mercantile and wholesale dry-goods trade center of the city, and was the subject of significant real-estate speculation.&lt;ref name=desrep7 /&gt; This phase came to an end by the close of the 19th century, and as the center of the city continued to move uptown, the quality of the area declined.&lt;ref name=desrep8&gt;Designation Report, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], the textile industry largely moved to the South, leaving many large buildings in the district unoccupied. In some buildings they were replaced by warehouses and printing plants, and other buildings were torn down to be replaced by gas stations, auto repair shops and parking lots and garages.&lt;ref name=extdesrep&gt;Betts, Mary Beth (ed.) [http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/sohoextdesignation.pdf "SoHo&amp;nbsp;– Cast-Iron Historic District Extension Designation Report"], [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] (May 11, 2010) pp.5–6&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s, the area had become known as '''Hell's Hundred Acres''',&lt;ref name=extdesrep /&gt; an industrial wasteland, full of [[sweatshop]]s and small factories in the daytime, but empty at night. It would not be until the 1960s, when artists began to be interested in the tall ceilings and many windows of the empty manufacturing lofts, that the character of the neighborhood began to change again.&lt;ref name=desrep8 /&gt;

===Cast-iron architecture===
SoHo boasts the greatest collection of [[cast-iron architecture]] in the world.&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, pp.39-41&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 250 cast-iron buildings stand in New York City, and the majority are in SoHo. Cast iron was initially used as a decorative front over a pre-existing building. With the addition of modern, decorative facades, older industrial buildings were able to attract new commercial clients. Most of these facades were constructed during the period from 1840 to 1880.&lt;ref name=enc-nyc /&gt; In addition to revitalizing older structures, buildings in SoHo were later designed to feature the cast iron.

[[File:E.V. Haughwout Building-2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[E. V. Haughwout Building]] at Broadway and [[Broome Street (Manhattan)|Broome Street]] was built in 1856–57, and has a cast-iron facade by [[Daniel D. Badger]]]]

An American architectural innovation, cast iron was cheaper to use for facades than materials such as stone or brick. Molds of ornamentation, prefabricated in foundries, were used interchangeably for many buildings, and a broken piece could be easily recast. The buildings could be erected quickly; some were built in four months. Despite the brief construction period, the quality of the cast-iron designs was not sacrificed. Bronze had previously been the metal most frequently used for architectural detail. Architects found that the relatively inexpensive cast iron could provide intricately designed patterns. Classical French and Italian architectural designs were often used as models for these facades. Because stone was the material associated with architectural masterpieces, cast iron, painted in neutral tints such as beige, was used to simulate stone.

There was a profusion of cast iron foundries in New York, including Badger's Architectural Iron Works, James L. Jackson's Iron Works, and Cornell Iron Works.

Since the iron was pliable and easily molded, sumptuously curved window frames were created, and the strength of the metal allowed these frames considerable height. The once-somber, gas-lit interiors of the industrial district were flooded with sunlight through the enlarged windows. The strength of cast iron permitted high ceilings with sleek supporting columns, and interiors became expansive and functional.

During cast iron's heyday, many architects thought it to be structurally more sound than steel. It was also thought that cast iron would be fire-resistant, and facades were constructed over many interiors built of wood and other flammable materials. When exposed to heat, cast iron buckled, and later cracked under the cold water used to extinguish fire. In 1899, a building code mandating the backing of cast-iron fronts with masonry was passed. Most of the buildings that stand today are constructed in this way. It was the advent of steel as a major construction material that brought an end to the cast iron era.{{clear left}}

===Lower Manhattan Expressway===
In the 1960s, the SoHo area was to have been the location of two enormous elevated [[highway]]s that comprised the two branches of the [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]], a [[Robert Moses]] project that was intended to create an [[automobile]] and [[truck]] through-route connecting the [[Manhattan Bridge]] and [[Williamsburg Bridge]] on the east with the [[Holland Tunnel]] on the west.&lt;ref name=enc-nyc /&gt;&lt;ref name="nycroads"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/lower-manhattan/ |title=Lower Manhattan Expressway (I-78 and I-478, unbuilt) |first=Steve |last=Anderson |work=NYCRoads |accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young [[historic preservation]] movement and [[architectural]] critics, stung by the destruction of the original [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Pennsylvania Station]] in 1963 and the threat to other historic structures, challenged the plans because of the threatened loss of a huge quantity of 19th-century cast-iron buildings.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-RememberingPioneer-2008"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/remembering-a-pioneer-of-the-preservation-movement/|title=Remembering a Pioneer of the Preservation Movement|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|authorlink=David W. Dunlap|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 29, 2008|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NYC SoHo Green Street.jpg|thumb|325px|right|[[Cast-iron architecture]] on Greene Street]]

When [[John V. Lindsay]] became [[Mayors of New York City|mayor of New York City]] in 1966, his initial reaction was to try to push the expressways through, dubbing the project the Lower Manhattan Expressway, depressing some of the proposed highway in residential areas and stressing the importance of the artery to the city. Nevertheless, through the efforts of [[Jane Jacobs]], Tony D'Apolito, [[Margot Gayle]], and other local, civic, and cultural leaders, as well as SoHo artist residents themselves, the project was derailed.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-RememberingPioneer-2008"/&gt;

===Artists move in===
After the abandonment of the highway scheme, the city was left with a large number of historic buildings that were unattractive for the kinds of [[manufacturing]] and [[commerce]] that survived in the city in the 1970s. The upper floors of many of these buildings had been built as commercial [[Manhattan loft]]s, which provided large, unobstructed spaces for manufacturing and other industrial uses. These spaces attracted artists who valued them for their large areas, large windows admitting [[natural lighting|natural light]] and low rents. Most of these spaces were also used illegally as living space, despite being neither [[zoning|zoned]] nor equipped for residential use. This widespread zoning violation was ignored for a long period of time, as the artist-occupants were using space for which there was little demand due to the city's poor economy at the time, and would have lain dormant or been abandoned otherwise.&lt;ref name=aia /&gt;&lt;ref name=enc-nyc /&gt;&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;
[[File:105 Mercer Street.jpg|thumb|left|187px|SoHo also contains former industrial buildings in other architectural styles, and is also dotted with smaller structures like this [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] house built in 1819–20.]]
Nevertheless, as the artist population grew, the city made some attempts to stem the movement, concerned about the occupation of space that did not meet residential building codes, and the possibility that the occupied space might be needed for the return of manufacturing to New York City. Pressured on many sides, the city abandoned attempts to keep the district as strictly [[industry|industrial]] space, and in 1971, the Zoning Resolution was amended to permit Joint Live-Work Quarters for artists, and the M1-5a and M-5b districting was established to permit visual artists, certified as such by the Department of Cultural Affairs, to live where they worked.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In 1987, non-artists residing in SoHo and NoHo were permitted to [[Grandfather clause|grandfather]] themselves, but that was the only extension to non-artists and was a one-time agreement.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The area received landmark designation as the SoHo–Cast Iron Historic District in 1973.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

[[File:428 Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|428 Broadway (428-432) was built in 1888-89 and was designed by Samuel A. Warner in the [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne style]]]]

===Gentrification and shopping===
In 2005, the construction of residential buildings on empty lots in the historic district was permitted. Nevertheless, with no enforcement of the new zoning laws by the city, beginning in the 1980s, in a way that would later apply elsewhere, the neighborhood began to draw [[List of highest-income urban neighborhoods in the United States|more affluent residents]]. Due to rent protection and stability afforded by the [[1982 Loft Law]], in addition to the fact that many of the artists owned their co-ops, many of the original pioneering artists remained despite the popular misconception that gentrification forced them to flee. Many residents have lived in the neighborhood for decades. In the mid-1990s, most of the galleries moved to Chelsea, but several galleries remain as of 2013, including William Bennett Gallery, [[Martin Lawrence Galleries]], [[Terrain Gallery]], Franklin Bowles Gallery, and Pop International Gallery.

SoHo's location, the appeal of lofts as living spaces, its architecture, and its reputation as a haven for artists all contributed to this change. The pattern of [[gentrification]] is typically known as the "SoHo Effect" and has been observed elsewhere in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/arts/artistic-enclave-gets-its-footing-in-rhode-island.html?pagewanted=2 | title = Artistic Enclave Gets Its Footing In Rhode Island | first= Katie | last= Zezima | work = [[The New York Times]] | date =August 10, 2004 | accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0928/p01s01-ussc.html | title= In New England, a city revival built on creativity | first=Sara B. | last=Miller | work = The Christian Science Monitor | date =September 28, 2004 | page = [http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0928/p01s01-ussc.html/(page)/2 2] | accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A backwater of poor artists and small factories in the 1970s, SoHo became a popular tourist destination for people seeking fashionable clothing and exquisite architecture, and home to some of the most expensive real estate in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Most Expensive ZIP Codes| work = [[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/special-report/2012/1016_zip-codes_rank.html|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SoHo's chain outlets are clustered in the northern area of the neighborhood, along [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and Prince and [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Streets]]. The sidewalks in this area are often crowded with tourists and with vendors selling jewelry, T-shirts, and other works. SoHo is known for its commercialization and eclectic mix of boutiques for shopping—although in 2010, it had twice as many chain stores as boutiques and three times as many boutiques as art galleries.&lt;ref name=sz&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/nyregion/21gentrify.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=A Contrarian's Lament in a Blitz of Gentrification|date=Feb 21, 2010|work=The New York Times|last=Powell|first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Third National Art Exhibition "Soviet Russia" (Moscow, 1967)''' ({{lang-ru|Третья Республиканская художественная выставка "Советская Россия" 1967 года}}) became a main national art event of 1967, as well as one of the largest Soviet art exhibitions of the 1960s. The exhibition took place in [[Moscow Manege|Manezh Exhibition Hall]].

== History and organization ==
The exhibition opened on September 20, 1967, in [[Moscow Manege]]. Organization and preparation of the Second National Art Exhibition "Soviet Russia" engaged a specially formed Exhibition Committee in the amount of 83 most authoritative experts in the field of fine arts under head of [[Vladimir Serov (painter)|Vladimir Serov]]. It published a catalog of the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;''Третья Республиканская художественная выставка «Советская Россия». Каталог.'' М., Советский художник, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, the Exhibition displayed over 2,000 works of art of painters, sculptors, graphics, masters of arts and crafts, artists of theater and cinema. Many of art works have been purchased for the largest Soviet art museums, including the [[Russian Museum]], the [[Tretyakov Gallery]], and others. After the Exhibition in Moscow there were organized traveling exhibitions, which have been shown in major cities of the Russian Federation.

'''Spanish Colonial architecture''' represents [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial]] influence on [[New World]] and [[East Indies]]' cities and towns, and it is still being seen in the [[architecture]] as well as in the [[Urban planning|city planning]] aspects of conserved present-day cities. These two visible aspects of the city are connected and complementary. The 16th century [[Laws of the Indies]] included provisions for the layout of new colonial settlements in the [[Americas]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://ca.phaidon.com/store/art/art-of-colonial-latin-america-9780714841571/&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve the desired effect of inspiring awe among the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]-Indians as well as creating a legible and militarily manageable landscape, the early colonizers used and placed the new architecture within planned townscapes and [[:Category:Spanish missions in the Americas|mission]] compounds.

The new [[church (building)|churches]] and [[mission station]]s, for example, aimed for maximum effect in terms of their imposition and domination of the surrounding buildings or countryside. In order for that to be achievable, they had to be strategically located – at the center of a [[town square]] (plaza) or at a higher point in the landscape. These elements are common and can also be found in almost every city and town in Spain.

The '''Spanish Colonial''' style of architecture dominated in the early Spanish colonies of North and South America, and were also somewhat visible in its other colonies. It is sometimes marked by the contrast between the simple, solid construction demanded by the new environment and the [[Baroque]] ornamentation exported from Spain.

Mexico, as the center of [[New Spain]]—and the richest province of Spain's colonial empire—has some of the most renowned buildings built in this style. With twenty-nine sites, Mexico has more sites on the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] list than any other country in the [[Americas]], many of them boasting some of the richest Spanish Colonial architecture. Some of the most famous cities in Mexico built in the Colonial style are [[Puebla]], [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]], [[Querétaro]], [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]], and [[Morelia]].

The historic center of [[Mexico City]] is a mixture of architectural styles from the 16th century to the present. The [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] – built from 1563 to 1813 in a variety of styles including the Renaissance, Baroque, and Neo Classical. The rich interior is mostly Baroque. Other examples are the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]], the beautifully restored 18th-century [[Palace of Iturbide|Palacio de Iturbide]], the 16th-century [[Casa de los Azulejos, Mexico City|Casa de los Azulejos]] – clad with 18th-century blue-and-white [[Talavera (pottery)|talavera]] tiles, and many more churches, cathedrals,  museums, and palaces of the elite.

During the late 17th century to 1750, one of Mexico's most popular architectural styles was Mexican [[Churrigueresque]]. These buildings were built in an ultra-[[Baroque]], fantastically extravagant and visually frenetic style.

[[Antigua Guatemala]] in [[Guatemala]] is also known for its well preserved Spanish colonial style architecture. The city of Antigua is famous for its well-preserved Spanish [[Mudéjar]]-influenced [[Baroque]] architecture as well as a number of spectacular ruins of colonial churches dating from the 16th century. It has been designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

The [[Ciudad Colonial]] (colonial city) of [[Santo Domingo]], [[Dominican Republic]], founded in 1498, is the oldest city in the New World and a prime example of this architectural style. The port of [[Cartagena, Colombia]], founded in 1533 and [[Santa Ana de Coro]], [[Venezuela]], founded in 1527, are two more [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] preserving some of the best Spanish colonial architecture in the Caribbean." [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] was founded by the Spaniards in 1521, where Spanish colonial architecture can be found like the Historic [[Hotel El Convento]].&lt;ref name="Peter Haldeman"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hotel El Convento: Making Over a Nunnery|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/archive/convento_article_052002|publisher=Architectural Digest|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Old San Juan]] with its walled city and buildings (ranging from 1521 to the early 20th century) are very good examples, and in excellent condition.

According to UNESCO, Quito, Ecuador has the largest, best-preserved, and least-altered historic centre (320 hectares) in Latin America, despite several earthquakes. It was the first city that was inscribed onto the UNESCO World Heritage List, along with Kraków, Poland in 1978. The historic district of this city is the sole largest and best preserved area of Spanish Colonial architecture in the world.

== History of the city grid in the New World ==
The idea of laying out a city in a grid pattern is not unique to the Spanish. In fact, it never started out with the Spanish colonizers. It has been traced back to some ancient civilizations especially the ancient cities of the [[Aztec]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and also [[Ancient Greek]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanislawski|first=Dan|title=The Origin and Spread of the Grid-Pattern Town|date=Jan 1946|volume=36|issue=1|jstor=211076}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was spread by the Roman conquest of European empires and its ideas were adopted by other civilizations. It was popularized at different paces and in different levels throughout the Renaissance—the French took to building grid-like villages (ville-neuves) and the English, under [[King Edward I]] did as well. Some{{who|date=April 2017}} argue, however, that Spain was not part of this movement to order towns as grids. Despite its clear military advantage, and despite the knowledge of city planning, the New World settlements of the Spanish actually grew amorphously for some three to four decades before they turned to grids and city plans as ways of organizing space.
In contrast to the orders given much later on how the city should be laid out, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] did not give specific instructions for how to build the new settlements in the Caribbeans. To Nicolas De Ovando, he said the following in 1501:

:As it is necessary in the island of Española to make settlements and from here it is not possible to give precise instructions, investigate the possible sites, and in conformity with the quality of the land and sites as well as with the present population outside present settlements establish settlements in the numbers and in the places that seem proper to you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanislawki|first=Dan|title=Early Spanish Town Planning in the New World|journal=Geographical Review|date=Jan 1947|volume=37|issue=1|jstor=211364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== City planning: a royal ordinance ==
[[File:Manila 1851.jpg|right|thumb|Map of the walled city of [[Intramuros]] in Manila with elements of colonial planning called [[Laws of the Indies]] present.]]
In 1513 the monarchs wrote out a set of guidelines that ordained the conduct of Spaniards in the New World as well as that of the Indians that they found there. With regards to city planning, these ordinances had details on the preferred location of a new town and its location relative to the sea, mountains and rivers. It also detailed the shape and measurements of the central plaza taking into account the spacing for purposes of trade as well as the spacing for purposes of festivities or even military operations—occasions that involved horse-riding. In addition to specifying the location of the church, the orientation of roads that run into the main plaza as well as the width of the street with respect to climatic conditions, the guidelines also specified the order in which the city must be built.

:The building lots and the structures erected thereon are to be so situated that in the living rooms one can enjoy air from the south and from the north, which are the best. All town homes are to be so planned that they can serve as a defense or fortress against those who might attempt to create disturbances or occupy the town. Each house is to be so constructed that horses and household animals can be kept therein, the courtyards and stockyards being as large as possible to insure health and cleanliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nuttall|first=Zelia|title=Royal Ordinances Concerning the Laying Out of New Towns|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|date=May 1922|volume=5|issue=2|pages=249–254|doi=10.2307/2506027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== La Traza ==
The '''traza''' or layout was the pattern on which Spanish American cities were built beginning in the colonial era.  At the heart of Spanish colonial cities was a central plaza, with the main church, town council (''cabildo'') building, residences of the main civil and religious officials, and the residences of the most important residents (''vecinos'') of the town built there. The principal businesses were also located around this central plan.  Radiated from the main square were streets in at right angles, a grid that could extend as the settlement grew, impeded only by geography.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, ''Early Latin America'', New York: Cambridge University Press, 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt; About three decades into colonization of the New World, the conquistadores started to build and plan cities according to laws prescribed by the monarchs in the Laws of the Indies. In addition to describing other aspects of the interactions between the Spanish conquerors and the natives they encountered, these laws ordained the specific ways new settlements should be laid out. In addition to specifying the layout, the laws also required a pattern in settlement based on social standing, in which the people of higher social status lived closer to the center of the town, the center of political, ecclesiastical, and economic power. The 1790 census for Mexico City indicates that in the traza that there was indeed a higher concentration of Spaniards (''españoles''), but that there was no absolute racial or class segregation in the city, particularly since elite households usually had non-white servants.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Nodin Valdés, "The Decline of the ''Sociedad de Castas'' in Mexico City." PhD Dissertation, University of Michigan 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The grid was not limited to Spanish settlements; however, "Reducciones" [[Indian Reductions]] and "Congregaciones"  were created in a similar grid-like manner for Indians in order to organize these populations in more manageable units for purposes of taxation, military efficiency and in order to teach Indians the way of the Spanish.

Modern cities in Latin America have grown, and consequently erased or jumbled the previous standard spatial and social organization of the cityscape. Elites do not always live closer to the city center, and the point-space occupied by individuals is not necessarily determined by their social status. The central plaza, the wide streets and a grid pattern are still common elements in [[Mexico City]] and [[Puebla]] de Los Angeles. It is not uncommon in modern-founded towns, especially those in remote areas of Latin America, to have retained the "checkerboard layout" even to present day.

Mexico City is a good example of how these ordinances were followed in laying out a city. Previously the capital of the Aztec empire, [[Tenochtitlan]] was captured and placed under Spanish rule in 1521. After news of the conquest, the king sent instructions very similar to the aforementioned Ordinance of 1513. In some parts the instructions are almost verbatim to his previous ones. The instructions were meant to direct the conqueror—[[Hernán Cortés]]—on how to lay out the city and how to allocate land to the Spaniards. It is pointed out, however, that though the king might have sent many such orders and instructions to other conquistadores, Cortés was perhaps the first one to implement them. He insisted on carrying out the building of a new city where the Indian Empire had stood, and he incorporated features of the old plaza into the new grid. Much was accomplished since he was accompanied by men familiar with the grid system and the royal instructions. The point here is that Cortés accomplished the planning and was on his way to finish the building of Mexico City before the royal ordinances addressed specifically to him even arrived. Men like Cortés and Alonso García Bravo (who is also called "the good geometer"),{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} played a crucial role in creating a city scape of New World cities as we know them.

In places of dense indigenous settlement, such as in Central Mexico, the mendicant orders (Franciscans, Dominicans, and Augustinians) built churches on the sites of prehispanic temples. In the early period of the "spiritual conquest", there were so many indigenous neophytes who attended Mass that a large open-air atrium was built, walling off a space within the church complex to create an enlarged sacred space without great expense of building.&lt;ref&gt;John McAndrew, ''The Open Air Churches of Sixteenth-Century Mexico: Atrios, Posas, Open Chapels and other Studies'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous labor was used in construction; since a communities sacred place was a symbol and embodiment of that community, laboring to create these structures was not necessarily an unwanted burden. Since Mexico experienced many sixteenth-century epidemics that drastically diminished the size of the central Mexican indigenous population, there were often elaborate churches with few Indians still living to attend them, such as the Augustinian church at Acolman, Mexico. The different mendicant orders had distinct styles of building. Franciscans built large churches to accommodate the new neophytes, Dominican churches were highly ornamented, while the Augustinian churches were characterized by their critics as opulent and sumptuous.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, and Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''. Pearson, 2003, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mission churches were often of simple design. As mendicants were pushed out of central Mexico and as Jesuits also evangelized Indians in northern Mexico, they built mission churches as part of a larger complex, with living quarters and workshops for resident Indians. Unlike central Mexico, where churches were built in existing indigenous towns, on the frontier where indigenous did not live in such settlements, the mission complex was created.&lt;ref&gt;Altman, et al., ''Early History of Greater Mexico'', pp. 130–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the Spaniards in 1571 brought in European colonial architecture to the Philippines. Specifically suited for the hot tropics of the new Far east territory, European architecture was transposed via Acapulco, Mexico into a uniquely Filipino style. The [[Nipa hut]] or [[Nipa hut|Bahay Kubo]] of the Indigenous Filipinos gave way to the ''[[Nipa hut#Bahay Na Bato|Bahay Na Bato]]'' (stone house) and other Filipino houses collectively called ''[[Nipa hut#Bahay Na Bato|Bahay Filipino]]'' (Filipino houses) and became the typical houses of Filipinos in the past.
The ''[[Ancestral houses of the Philippines|Bahay Filipino]]'' houses, followed the nipa hut's arrangements such as open ventilation and elevated apartments. The most obvious difference between Filipino houses would be the materials that was used to build them. Bahay na bato has Spanish and [[Chinese architecture|Chinese]] influence. Its most common appearance is like that of stilt Nipa hut that stands on Spanish style stone blocks or bricks as foundation instead only just of wood or bamboo stilts, usually with solid stone foundations or brick lower walls, and overhanging, wooden upper story/stories with balustrades Ventanillas and [[capiz shell]] sliding windows, and a Chinese tiled roof or sometimes Nipa roof which are today being replaced by galvanized roof. Today these houses are more commonly called [[Ancestral houses of the Philippines|Ancestral houses]], due to most ancestral houses in the Philippines are Bahay na bato.&lt;ref&gt;http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:81/CC01/NLP00VM052mcd/v2/v3.pdf''THE SPANISH COLONIAL TRADITION.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earthquake Baroque''' is a style of [[Baroque architecture]] found in the [[Philippines]], which suffered destructive [[Earthquake|earthquakes]] during the 17th century and 18th century, where large public buildings, such as [[Church (building)|churches]], were rebuilt in a [[Baroque]] style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bootsnall.com/articles/05-06/antiguas-environs-antigua-guatemala.html "Antigua’s Environs – Antigua, Guatemala"]. BootsnAll Indie Travel Guide. Retrieved on 2011-07-06.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Philippines, destruction of earlier churches from frequent earthquakes have made the church proportion lower and wider; side walls were made thicker and heavily [[Buttress|buttressed]] for stability during shaking.  The upper structures were made with lighter materials.&lt;ref name="City"&gt;[http://www.aenet.org/manila-expo/page16.htm "The City of God: Churches, Convents and Monasteries"]. Discovering Philippines. Retrieved on 2011-07-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell towers are usually lower and stouter compared to towers in less seismically active regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Finch, Ric. [http://www.rutahsa.com/antigua.html "Antigue Guatemala-- Monumental City of the Americas"]. Rutahsa Adventures. Retrieved on 2011-07-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  Towers have thicker girth in the lower levels, progressively narrowing to the topmost level.&lt;ref name="City" /&gt; In some churches of the Philippines, aside from functioning as watchtowers against pirates, some bell towers are detached from the main church building to avoid damage in case of a falling bell tower due to an earthquake.

'''Symphony No. 3''', Op. 21, in C major is a large-scale orchestral-vocal composition by the Romanian composer [[George Enescu]], written in 1916–18.

==History==
Enescu began writing the Third Symphony at [[Sinaia]] in May 1916, not long before [[Romania during World War I|Romania entered the First World War]]. During the withdrawal of Romania to the province of [[Moldavia]] in face of the invading forces of the [[Central Powers]], he finished the first movement in 1917 at [[Iași]]. The second movement was completed at the height of the conflict, in January 1918, also at Iași, and the third was finished on 20 August of the same year at [[Dorohoi]] ({{harvnb|Hoffman and Marbe|1971|loc=471}}; {{harvnb|Malcolm|1990|loc=125, 274}}). The premiere date is disputed. According to one authority the Symphony was first performed in 1918 and then again at least once in the same year {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=544n12}}. According to others, however, the first performance did not take place until 25 May 1919 at the [[Romanian Athenaeum|Athenaeum]] in Bucharest, with the Orchestra of the Ministry of Education and the Carmen Choral Society, conducted by the composer, prefaced by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach's]] [[Brandenburg_Concertos#No._4_in_G_major,_BWV_1049|''Brandenburg'' Concerto No. 4]] ({{harvnb|Hoffman and Marbe|1971|loc=468–69}}; {{harvnb|Malcolm|1990|loc=128–29}}). Although the symphony was an immediate success, Enescu was not satisfied with it and undertook a revision in 1920. The new version was premiered in Paris at the end of February 1921, conducted by [[Gabriel Pierné]], but Enescu still was not satisfied and continued to revise the score for more than thirty years. The latest revision is dated 12 June 1951 ({{harvnb|Malcolm|1990|loc=129}}; {{harvnb|Bentoiu|2010|loc=196, 544n12}}). It was not published until 1965, by the Editura muzicală a uniunii compozitorilor din Republica socialistă românia in Bucharest.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for 4 flutes, 4 oboes, 4 clarinets, 4 bassoons, 6 horns, 6 trumpets, 4 trombones, 3 tubas, timpani, 6 percussionists, piano, organ, wordless chorus, 2 harps, 20 first violins, 20 second violins, 14 violas, 12 cellos and 12 double basses.

==Analysis==
[[File:Ateneul Român stage.jpg|thumb|Stage of the Athenaeum, Bucharest]]
The symphony is in three [[movement (music)|movements]]:
*Moderato, un poco maestoso
*Vivace ma non troppo
*Lento ma non troppo

Enescu employs the same thematic material throughout the symphony, [[Cyclic form|cyclically]], but develops it in different ways. The first movement alternates brooding, questioning, heroic, and lyrical moods; the second movement is a darkly sinister scherzo, relieved briefly by a bright march episode; the finale is solemn and serene, introducing a wordless choir. It ends in "a sort of quiet ecstasy" with the lightest of orchestral textures and employs at one point a small bell which, according to the score, "should have the same sort of sonority as the bells which are used in Catholic churches at the Elevation of the Host". The strongly contrasted characters of the three movements—and especially the paradisal serenity of the finale—have tempted some critics, beginning with [[Pierre Lalo]] in 1921, to interpret the symphony programmatically as a "[[Dante Alighieri|Dantesque]] trilogy" of [[Purgatorio (Dante)|Purgatory]] (alternatively, Earth), [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], and [[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradise]] {{harv|Malcolm|1990|loc=125, 128}}.

'''''Terms of Endearment''''' is a 1983 American [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] adapted from [[Larry McMurtry]]'s [[Larry_McMurtry#Houston_series|1975 novel]], directed, written, and produced by [[James L. Brooks]], and starring [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Debra Winger]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Jeff Daniels]], and [[John Lithgow]]. The film covers 30 years of the relationship between Aurora Greenway (MacLaine) and her daughter Emma (Winger).

The film received eleven [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, and won five. Brooks won the Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium]], while MacLaine won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], and Nicholson won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. In addition, it won four [[Golden Globe]]s: [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama|Best Motion Picture – Drama]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama|Best Actress in a Drama]] (MacLaine), [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor]] (Nicholson), and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] (Brooks).

==Plot== 	
Widowed Aurora Greenway ([[Shirley MacLaine]]) keeps several suitors at arm's length, focusing instead on her close, but controlling, relationship with daughter Emma ([[Debra Winger]]). Anxious to escape her mother, Emma marries young college professor Flap Horton ([[Jeff Daniels]]) over her mother's objections, moves away, and has three children. Despite their frequent spats and difficulty getting along, Emma and Aurora have a tie between them that cannot be broken, and keep in touch by telephone.

Emma and Flap soon run into financial and marital difficulties. Emma has trouble managing the children and household, and she and Flap both have extramarital affairs. Emma relies increasingly on her mother for emotional support. Meanwhile, the lonely Aurora overcomes her repression, and begins a whirlwind romance with her next-door neighbor, retired [[astronaut]] Garrett Breedlove ([[Jack Nicholson]]). 

The Horton family moves from Houston to Des Moines and eventually to Nebraska, apparently for Flap's career, but mostly so he can be near his girlfriend. Emma is diagnosed with cancer, which becomes terminal. Aurora stays by Emma's side through her treatment and hospitalization, even while dealing with her own pain after Garrett suddenly ends their relationship. The dying Emma shows her love for her mother by entrusting her own children to Aurora's care. After Emma's death, Garrett re-appears in the family's life, and begins to bond with Emma's young children.

==Production==
Brooks wrote the supporting role of Garrett Breedlove for [[Burt Reynolds]], who turned down the role because of a verbal commitment he had made to appear in ''[[Stroker Ace]]''. "There are no awards in Hollywood for being an idiot", Reynolds later said of the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0002/23/lkl.00.html | title= 	Larry King Live:Burt Reynolds Discusses His Career in Showbiz | date=February 23, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior shots of Aurora's home were filmed at 3060 Locke Lane, Houston, Texas. [[Larry McMurtry]], writer of the novel on which the screenplay was based, had received his M.A. at [[Rice University]], a mere three miles from the home.

The exterior shots of locations intended to be in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], [[Kearney, Nebraska]], and Lincoln, Nebraska, were all filmed in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]. Many scenes were filmed on, or near, the campus of the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/t/Terms_Of_Endearment.html#.V7fb6o-cHIU|title=Filming Locations for Oscar-winner Terms Of Endearment (1983), around Texas and Nebraska.|first=Tony|last=Reeves|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During filming in Lincoln, Debra Winger met the then-governor of Nebraska, [[Bob Kerrey]], and wound up dating him for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-12/entertainment/ca-438_1_debra-winger|title=SHORT TAKES : Debra Winger Is Not for Politics|date=September 12, 1990|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On working with Nicholson, MacLaine said, "Working with Jack Nicholson was crazy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ouzuonian|first=Richard|title=The present life of Shirley MacLaine|date=1 May 2015|publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]''|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2015/05/01/the-present-life-of-shirley-maclaine.html|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that his spontaneity may have contributed to her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shirley MacLaine on Jack Nicholson: He showed up to set practically nude|date=October 30, 2014|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/10/30/shirley-maclaine-on-jack-nicholson-showed-up-to-set-practically-nude/|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We're like old smoothies working together. You know the old smoothies they used to show whenever you went to the [[Ice Follies]]. They would have this elderly man and woman – who at that time were 40 – and they had a little bit too much weight around the waist and were moving a little slower. But they danced so elegantly and so in synch with each other that the audience just laid back and sort of sighed. That's the way it is working with Jack. We both know what the other is going to do. And we don't socialize, or anything. It's an amazing chemistry – a wonderful, wonderful feeling.&lt;ref name=tcm/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
MacLaine confirmed in an interview with ''[[USA Today]]'' that Nicholson improvised when he put his hand down her dress in the beach scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexander|first=Bryan|title=Shirley MacLaine tries to bring Jack Nicholson on board "with every script"|date=2 March 2017|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/03/02/shirley-maclaine-tries-bring-jack-nicholson-board-every-script/98621194/|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The film was generally well regarded by critics, and maintains an 88% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with the consensus: "A classic tearjerker, ''Terms of Endearment'' isn't shy about reaching for the heartstrings – but is so well-acted and smartly scripted that it's almost impossible to resist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/terms_of_endearment/ | title=Terms of Endearment Movie Reviews, Pictures | publisher=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a four-out-of-four star rating, calling it "a wonderful film" and stating, "There isn't a thing that I would change, and I was exhilarated by the freedom it gives itself to move from the high comedy of Nicholson's best moments to the acting of Debra Winger in the closing scenes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Ebert | first =Roger | title =Terms of Endearment | work =[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date =November 23, 1983 | url =http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/terms-of-endearment-1983 | accessdate =April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]], who gave the film a highly enthusiastic review, correctly predicted upon its release that it would go on to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] of 1983. In his movie guide, [[Leonard Maltin]] awarded the film a rare four-star rating, calling it a "Wonderful mix of humor and heartache", and concluded the film was "Consistently offbeat and unpredictable, with exceptional performances by all three stars".&lt;ref name="bookref1"&gt;{{cite book| last=Maltin| first=Leonard| authorlink=|title=2013 Movie Guide|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|date=|location=|pages=1386|isbn=978-0-451-23774-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Birth of a Race''''' is a [[1918 in film|1918]] American [[Silent film|silent]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[John W. Noble]]. It was made as a response to the 1915 film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', and was meant to discredit the negative stereotypes perpetuated by the film. Initially, it was intended to be a short answer film that could be appended to ''The Birth of a Nation'' in 1915 but a combination of weak financial backing and growing ambitions delayed its completion for more than two years.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/85119/Birth-of-a-Race/overview|title=The Birth of a Race}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/AbbrView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=2099|work=[[American Film Institute|AFI]]|title=The AFI Catalog of Feature Films: ''The Birth of a Race''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/B/BirthOfARace1918.html|title=''The Birth of a Race''|work=silentera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When finally released in December, 1918, following the end of [[World War I]], ''The Birth of a Race'' was a two-hour feature length film, portraying the achievements of black people through history.&lt;ref name=tbt&gt;{{cite news|author=Guzzo, Paul|title=

This film is preserved at the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.mbrs.sfdb.1678/default.html|work=The Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog|title=''The Birth of a Race''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Following the "Birth of the Human Race" section, the film had epic scenes of ancient Egypt with [[Nubians|Nubian]] soldiers and the [[finding of Moses|rescue of infant Moses in the river]]. A later scene portrayed [[Simon of Cyrene]] helping Jesus carry his cross on the [[Via Dolorosa]] and the signing of the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref name=tbt /&gt;

The film then shifted to World War I, with two white brothers in a [[German-American]] family going to war in Europe, one ("George") fighting for the United States, and the other ("Oscar") fighting for Germany. George is wounded, and at the hospital defends it from a German attack, killing Oscar in the process. George is sent home to America, where he rescues his wife from a German spy.

==Production==
[[File:Birth of a Race set.png|thumb|left|Filming on an Egyptian set in Tampa, 1918]]
Principal filming took place in Chicago and Tampa, Florida. Several outdoor scenes were filmed in Tampa in January, 1918, including ancient Egypt and the rescue of the infant Moses from a river and [[Simon of Cyrene]] helping Jesus carry his cross on the [[Via Dolorosa]].&lt;ref name=tbt /&gt;

==Reception==
Critics complained that the screenplay was muddled about two white brothers fighting on opposite sides in WWI. ''Birth of a Race'' also suffered at the box office due to its release just weeks after the end of WWI; audiences were no longer interested in seeing a war film.&lt;ref name=tbt /&gt;

'''''The Café-Concert''''' is an 1879 painting by the French painter [[Édouard Manet]], who often captured café scenes depicting social life at the end of the nineteenth century similar to those depicted in this painting.&lt;ref name="Art babble"&gt;[http://www.arable.com/artists/edouard_manet#works ArtBabble]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The setting has been identified as the Brasserie Reichshoffen on the Boulevard Rochechouart.&lt;ref name="William Johnston"&gt;Johnston, W., Nineteenth Century Art: From Romanticism to Art Nouveau, The Walters Art Gallery, 2000, p. 136, {{ISBN|1857592263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manet shows us men and women in the new brasseries and cafes of Paris, which presents the viewer with an alternate view of new Parisian life.&lt;ref name="Herbert"&gt;Herbert, R.L., Impressionists:Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society, Yale University Press, 1991, p. 2, {{ISBN|0300050836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manet claimed he was painting “des oeuvres sinceres” or “sincere works”. The women depicted in these scenes were courting certain risks with regards to perception and morality.&lt;ref name="Dolan"&gt;Dolan,T., Perspectives on Manet, Ashgate, 2012, p. 23, {{ISBN|1409420744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
In ''The Café-Concert'', Manet presents a [[Café-chantant|café-concert]] in which three central figures form a triangle but are all engaged in opposite directions.   The scene of a café-concert, supposedly casual, is hinted by Manet to be one of separation. The waitress enjoys a beer, while the woman at the bar smokes a cigarette and appears subdued and the man appears to be at ease as he watches the performance (the singer known as “La Belle Polonaise” is reflected in the mirror in the background of the painting). It is noted that the man evokes confidence, because men unlike women could frequent cafés without insecurity.&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt; The painting was posed and completed in a studio but gives the appearance of being freshly observed.&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;

==Analysis==
In this painting, concepts of conventional composition are rejected. The figures of the individuals represented are not clearly defined but modeled with brushstrokes. The colors are placed directly on the canvas with loose, repetitive strokes instead of applying layers of pigments and glazes over a dark background.&lt;ref name="William Johnston"/&gt;

==''Off the Wall''==
Currently, ''The Café-Concert '' is being featured in ''Off the Wall'', an open-air exhibition on the streets of [[Baltimore]], Maryland. A reproduction of the painting, the original is part of [[The Walters Art Museum]] collection, will be on display at the CFG Community Bank (Fell's Point).&lt;ref name="Off the Wall"&gt;[http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ Walters Art Museum - Off the Wall] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119005400/http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ |date=2012-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Gallery in London began the concept of bringing art out of doors in 2007 and the Detroit Institute of Art introduced the concept in the U.S.. The ''Off the Wall'' reproductions of the Walters' paintings are done on weather-resistant vinyl and include a description of the painting and a QR code for smart phones.&lt;ref name="The Baltimore Sun"&gt;Smith, T., Walters Art Museum goes of the wall, The Baltimore Sun, September 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Slim Shady LP''''' is the second studio album and the major-label debut&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaufman|first1=Gil|title=Best Of '99: Eminem Pulls No Punches On Major-Label Debut Album|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/511899/best-of-99-eminem-pulls-no-punches-on-major-label-debut-album/|accessdate=25 May 2017|publisher=MTV News|date=9 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; by American rapper [[Eminem]]. It was released on February 23, 1999 by [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and [[Interscope Records]]. Recorded in [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]], [[Michigan]], following Eminem's recruitment by [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Jimmy Iovine]], the album features production from Dr. Dre, the [[Bass Brothers]], and Eminem himself. ''The Slim Shady LP'' is his first album with a major label after his first album ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'' was released on an independent label in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaufman|first1=Gil|title=Best Of '99: Eminem Pulls No Punches On Major-Label Debut Album|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/511899/best-of-99-eminem-pulls-no-punches-on-major-label-debut-album/|accessdate=25 May 2017|publisher=MTV News|date=9 February 1999|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913062602/http://www.mtv.com/news/511899/best-of-99-eminem-pulls-no-punches-on-major-label-debut-album/|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the album's lyrical content is written from the perspective of the rapper's [[alter ego]] Slim Shady, whom the rapper created on the ''[[Slim Shady EP]]'' (1997). The lyrics are noted for their depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity.

The album was met with both critical and commercial success; critics praised Eminem for his unique lyrical style, and the album debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] behind [[TLC (band)|TLC]]'s ''[[FanMail]]'' with 283,000 copies sold in its opening week. "[[Just Don't Give a Fuck]]", from the [[Slim Shady EP]], was released in October 1998. 

The first official single, "[[My Name Is]]", peaked at number 36 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming his first entry on that chart. ''The Slim Shady LP'' went on to be certified quadruple-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and has sold over 18 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biggest selling artist of the 21st century|url=https://medium.com/@shelrochaleal/the-biggest-selling-artist-of-the-21st-century-958352bda1ca|accessdate=25 September 2018|publisher=A Medium Corporation|date=2 February 2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album won a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Best Rap Album]], and in 2012, the album was ranked number 275 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ''Magazine'''s  list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time - Eminem, 'The Slim Shady LP'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/eminem-the-slim-shady-lp-20120524|website=Rolling Stone|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510002609/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/eminem-the-slim-shady-lp-20120524|archivedate=2015-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Slim Shady LP'' turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. [[Interscope Records]] awarded him with his own record label, [[Shady Records]], and he embarked on an extensive touring schedule to promote the album. In the summer of 1999, the rapper frequently performed on the [[Vans Warped Tour]] and in hip-hop clubs. He also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] and a negative influence on American youth.

== Background ==
Eminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, his debut album ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'', which was recorded at the Bassmint, a recording studio owned by the [[Bass Brothers]], was released under their independent record label [[Web Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozza|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Infinite'' achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations.  The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: "After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A lot of it was because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don't you go into rock &amp; roll?' All that type of shit started pissing me off."&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;  After the release of ''Infinite'', Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in a suicide attempt.&lt;ref name="allmusicbio"&gt;{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |title=Eminem – Biography |url=http://allmusic.com/artist/eminem-p347307/biography |work=AllMusic |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=November 29, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129034257/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eminem-p347307/biography |archivedate=November 29, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disappointment of ''Infinite'' inspired Eminem to create the [[alter ego]] Slim Shady: "Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all these words to rhyme with it."&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;  Slim Shady served as Eminem's vent for his frustrations, and in the spring of 1997, he recorded the eight-song extended play ''[[Slim Shady EP]]''. During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times.&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;  After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to [[Los Angeles]] to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide [[rap battle]] competition.  He placed second, and the staff at [[Interscope Records]] who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of the ''Slim Shady EP'' to company CEO [[Jimmy Iovine]].&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt; Iovine played the tape for hip hop producer [[Dr. Dre]], founder of [[Aftermath Entertainment]].  Dr. Dre recalled, "In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'"&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt; Eminem and Dr. Dre subsequently began work on Eminem's major-label debut album.

==Recording==
[[File:Dr. Dre.jpg|thumb|190px|Eminem had idolized ''The Slim Shady LP'' co-producer Dr. Dre (''pictured in 2008'') since he was a teenager.]]
''The Slim Shady LP'' was recorded at Studio 8 at 430 [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|8 Mile Road]] in [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]], [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Studiowhere"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494874/slim-shady-studio-up-auction.jhtml|title=Studio Where Eminem Worked On Shady LP Up For Auction|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=December 14, 2004|accessdate=March 4, 2012|work=MTV News|publisher=Viacom|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111120430/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494874/slim-shady-studio-up-auction.jhtml|archivedate=November 11, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since listening to his group [[N.W.A]] as a teenager, was nervous to work with him on the album: "I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much&amp;nbsp;... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre."&lt;ref name="Bozza24"&gt;Bozza, 2003. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions.&lt;ref name="Stubbs58"&gt;Stubbs, 2006. p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;  The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his [[freestyle rap]]s; "Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for", Eminem recalled.&lt;ref name="Stubbs58"/&gt; He later said: "Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them." "&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;  On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished "[[My Name Is]]" in an hour.&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;  Three other songs, including "Role Model", were also recorded that day.&lt;ref name="Bozza24"/&gt;

"[['97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde]]", which was formerly featured on the ''Slim Shady EP'' as "Just the Two of Us", was rerecorded for ''The Slim Shady LP'' to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead told her that he would be taking Hailie to [[Chuck E. Cheese's]]. However, he really took her to the recording studio.&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt; He explained, "When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out." Eminem also said, "When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it."&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;  The song "[[Guilty Conscience (song)|Guilty Conscience]]" contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted [[Dee Barnes]].  Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre "fell out of his chair laughing" upon hearing the lyric.&lt;ref name="Stubbs68"&gt;Stubbs, 2006. p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ken Kaniff", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle.  After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums.&lt;ref name="Bozza43"&gt;Bozza, 2003. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Another skit, "Bitch", is an answering machine message in which Zoe Winkler, daughter of actor [[Henry Winkler]], tells a friend that she was disgusted by Eminem's music. He met and had dinner with her in order to get permission to use the recording on the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chonin|first1=Neva|title=Rage Against the Past / Eminem is a former skinny white kid who raps with a vengeance|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Rage-Against-the-Past-Eminem-is-a-former-skinny-2931902.php|accessdate=January 19, 2018|date=May 8, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Eminem was mixing ''The Slim Shady LP'', at the same time, [[Kid Rock]] was recording his fourth studio album, ''[[Devil Without a Cause]]''; being friends with Kid Rock, Eminem asked Kid Rock to record [[scratching]] for Eminem's song "My Fault", which appears on ''The Slim Shady LP''; in return, Eminem delivered a guest rap verse on Kid Rock's song "Fuck Off" for ''Devil Without a Cause''.&lt;ref name=freepearly&gt;https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/brian-mccollum/2015/08/26/kid-rock-early-years-detroit/31193049/&lt;/ref&gt;

Eminem's vocal inflection on the record has been described as a "nasal whine"; Jon Pareles of ''[[The New York Times]]'' likened his "calmly sarcastic delivery" to "the early [[Beastie Boys]] turned cynical".&lt;ref name="NYtimesrev"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/17/arts/pop-review-a-rapper-more-gauche-than-gangsta.html|title=Pop Review; A Rapper More Gauche Than Gangsta|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=April 17, 1999|accessdate=July 12, 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113094605/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/17/arts/pop-review-a-rapper-more-gauche-than-gangsta.html|archivedate=November 13, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', columnist Greg Kot compared the rapper's vocals to "[[Pee-wee Herman]] with a nasal Midwestern accent".&lt;ref name="ctrev"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-04-09/features/9904090063_1_slim-shady-lp-eminem-vanilla-ice|title=Feeding the Frenzy|last=Kot|first=Greg|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Company|date=April 9, 1999|accessdate=July 12, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103160810/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-04-09/features/9904090063_1_slim-shady-lp-eminem-vanilla-ice|archivedate=November 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A skit entitled "Lounge" appears before "My Fault" featuring Eminem and the Bass Brothers imitating [[rat pack]] crooners.

Many of the songs from ''The Slim Shady LP'' are written from the perspective of Eminem's alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish depictions of violence, which he refers to as "made-up tales of trailer-park stuff".&lt;ref name="Bite"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bite me|last=Verrico|first=Lisa|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=May 20, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the [[horror film]] genre: "Why can't people see that records can be like movies?  The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren't on a screen."&lt;ref name="Noshame?"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/14/entertainment/ca-29770|title=Has He No Shame?|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|work=The Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=May 14, 2000|accessdate=March 11, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715014258/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/14/entertainment/ca-29770|archivedate=July 15, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] by critics and commentators.&lt;ref name="Guardiancover"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cover story: Emma Brockes meets Eminem|last=Brockes|first=Emma|date=November 12, 1999|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, "I have a fairly salty relationship with women&amp;nbsp;... But most of the time, when I'm saying shit about women, when I'm saying 'bitches' and 'hoes', it's so ridiculous that I'm taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don't hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.'"&lt;ref name="Guardiancover"/&gt;  Despite the album's explicit nature, Eminem refused to say the word "[[nigga]]" on the album, with the rapper noting, "It's not in my vocabulary."&lt;ref name="Guardiancover"/&gt; ''The Slim Shady LP'' begins with a "Public Service Announcement" introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic [[disclaimer]] discussing the album's explicit lyrical content.&lt;ref name="Bestskit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/12/the-50-greatest-hip-hop-skits/eminem-public-service-announcement-2000|title=The 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Skits - Eminem "Public Service Announcement"|last=Alvarez|first=Gabriel|date=December 6, 2011|accessdate=March 11, 2012|work=Complex|publisher=Complex Media|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109035556/http://www.complex.com/music/2011/12/the-50-greatest-hip-hop-skits/eminem-public-service-announcement-2000|archivedate=January 9, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in the album, a skit entitled "Paul" features a phone call from [[Paul Rosenberg (music manager)|Paul Rosenberg]] to Eminem telling him to "tone down" his lyrics.&lt;ref name="Hasted111"&gt;Hasted, 2011. p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

"Guilty Conscience" is a concept song featuring Dr. Dre.  The song focuses on a series of characters who are faced with various situations, while Dr. Dre and Eminem serve as the "angel" and "devil" sides of the characters' conscience, respectively.&lt;ref name="Newsroom"/&gt;  The song draws inspiration from a scene in the 1978 comedy film ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', in which a man takes advice from an angel and devil on his shoulder while considering raping an unconscious girl at a party.&lt;ref name="Noshame?"/&gt; In the film, he ends up deciding not to go through with the rape, but in "Guilty Conscience", the outcome is unclear.&lt;ref name="Noshame?"/&gt;  On "My Fault", Eminem tells the story of a girl who overdoses on [[Psilocybin mushrooms|psychedelic mushrooms]] at a [[rave]].&lt;ref name="Bozza49"&gt;Bozza, 2003. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  "[['97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde]]" features Eminem convincing his infant daughter to assist him in disposing of his wife's corpse. It is an [[epilogue]] to the song "[[Kim (Eminem song)|Kim]]", although "'97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde" was released first. Eminem wrote the song at a time in which he felt that Kim was stopping him from seeing his daughter.&lt;ref name="Noshame?"/&gt;  Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic explained that "There have been more violent songs in rap, but few more disturbing, and it's not because of what it describes, it's how he describes it -- how the perfectly modulated phrasing enhances the horror and black humor of his words."&lt;ref name="AllmusicReview"/&gt;  On the song "Brain Damage", Eminem discusses his childhood experiences with bullies at school.&lt;ref name="AllegedBully"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451396/alleged-bully-sues-eminem-1-million.jhtml|title=Alleged Bully From Eminem's 'Brain Damage' Files $1 Million Suit|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|date=December 10, 2001|accessdate=February 16, 2012|work=MTV News|publisher=Viacom|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202035439/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451396/alleged-bully-sues-eminem-1-million.jhtml|archivedate=February 2, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many of the lyrics on the album are intended to be humorous, several songs depict Eminem's frustrations with living in poverty. When discussing ''The Slim Shady LP'', Anthony Bozza of ''Rolling Stone'' described Eminem as "probably the only MC in 1999 who boasts low self-esteem.  His rhymes are jaw-droppingly perverse, bespeaking a minimum-wage life devoid of hope, flushed with rage and weaned on sci-fi and slasher flicks."&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eminem-blows-up-20091105|title=Eminem Blows Up|last=Bozza|first=Anthony|date=November 5, 2009|accessdate=February 16, 2012|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FxQwPdj4?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eminem-blows-up-20091105|archivedate=April 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eminem was inspired to write "Rock Bottom" after being fired from his cooking job at a restaurant days before his daughter's birthday.&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;  The song bemoans human dependency on money, discussing its ability to brainwash an individual.&lt;ref name="Stubbs81" /&gt;  He illustrates his struggles to provide for his daughter, describing himself as "discouraged, hungry, and malnourished."&lt;ref name="Stubbs81"/&gt;  "If I Had" follows a similar theme, as he describes living on minimum wage and remarks that he is "tired of jobs starting off at $5.50 an hour".&lt;ref name="Hartigan162"&gt;Hartigan, 2005. p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;  In the song, he expresses his irritation with fitting the "white trash" stereotype.&lt;ref name="Hartigan161"&gt;Hartigan, 2005. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was met with general acclaim from [[music critics]]. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[AllMusic]] gave the album five stars out of five, praising the rapper's "expansive vocabulary and vivid imagination", adding that "Years later, as the shock has faded, it's those lyrical skills and the subtle mastery of the music that still resonate, and they're what make ''The Slim Shady LP'' one of the great debuts in both hip-hop and modern pop music."&lt;ref name="AllmusicReview"/&gt;  David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described the album's "unapologetic outrageousness" as a reaction to the "soul positivity" of [[conscious hip hop]], noting that "''The Slim Shady LP'' marks the return of irreverent, wiseass attitude to the genre, heard throughout the album in its nonstop barrage of crudely funny rhymes&amp;nbsp;... Even pop fans deadened to graphic lyrics are likely to flinch."&lt;ref name="EWeekly Review"/&gt;  Soren Baker of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave the album three and a half stars out of four and stated that "He isn't afraid to say anything; his lyrics are so clever that he makes murder sound as if it's a funny act he may indulge in simply to pass the time" but lamented the "sometimes flat production that takes away from the power of Eminem's verbal mayhem."&lt;ref name="LATimes Review"/&gt;

Many reviewers commented on the album's lyrical content. Gilbert Rodman of ''[[Popular Communications]]'' states, "Eminem's music contains more than its fair share of misogynistic and homo-phobic lyrics, but simply to reduce it to these (as many critics do) doesn't help to explain Eminem. It merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodman|first=Gilbert|title=And Other Four Letter Words: Eminem And The Cultural Politics Of Authenticity|journal=[[Popular Communications]]|year=2006|pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rob Sheffield of ''Rolling Stone'' enjoyed the record's comedic nature, writing "Simply put: Eminem will crack you up", but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that "the wife-killing jokes of "97 Bonnie and Clyde' aren't any funnier than [[Garth Brooks]]', and 'My Fault' belongs on some sorry-ass [[Bloodhound Gang]] record."&lt;ref name="RSReview"/&gt; Nathan Rabin of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' felt that although the album is "sophomoric and uninspired" at times, Eminem's "surreal, ultraviolent, trailer-trash/post-gangsta-rap extremism is at least a breath of fresh air in a rap world that's despairingly low on new ideas."&lt;ref name="Rabin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/eminem-the-slim-shady-lp,20723/|title=Eminem: The Slim Shady LP - Review|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|work=''[[The A.V.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Eminem-01-mika.jpg|thumb|The success of the album transformed Eminem into an international celebrity. Pictured in a concert in [[Munich]], Germany in October 1999]]
After the success of ''The Slim Shady LP'', Eminem went from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. [[Interscope Records]] awarded him with his own record label, [[Shady Records]]; the first artist Eminem signed was rapper and his best friend [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]].&lt;ref name="Hasted 123"&gt;Hasted, 2011. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;  Eminem, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle: "This last Christmas, there were so many fucking presents under the tree&amp;nbsp;... My daughter wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth. But she's got one now. I can't stop myself from spoiling her."&lt;ref name="Hasted 123"/&gt;

To promote ''The Slim Shady LP'', Eminem embarked on an extensive tour schedule.  He joined the [[Vans Warped Tour]] as a last-minute replacement for [[Cypress Hill]], a schedule that included 31 North American dates from June 25 to July 31, beginning in San Antonio and ending in Miami.&lt;ref name="Huxley79"&gt;Huxley, 2000. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; He often played a show in the afternoon on the Warped Tour, and then drove to another location to perform at a hip hop club at night.&lt;ref name="Hasted 123"/&gt; During a performance in Hartford, Connecticut near the end of the Warped Tour, Eminem slipped on a puddle of liquid and fell ten feet down off the stage, cracking several ribs.&lt;ref name="Huxley79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hasted 125"&gt;Hasted, 2011. p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled that the stress of his newfound fame led him to drink excessively, and reflected, "I knew I had to slow it down. The fall was like a reminder."&lt;ref name="Hasted 125"/&gt; However, after receiving medical attention, he was well enough to travel to New York the following day for a performance on ''[[Total Request Live]]''.&lt;ref name="Huxley79"/&gt;

Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content.  He was labeled as "misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence", and in an editorial by ''Billboard'' editor in chief [[Timothy White (editor)|Timothy White]], the writer accused Eminem of "making money by exploiting the world's misery."&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt; During a radio interview in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a [[Freestyle rap|freestyle]] about "slapping a pregnant bitch" to the extent that on air she broke a copy of ''The Slim Shady LP''.&lt;ref name="Hasted 125"/&gt; The rapper defended himself by saying, "My album isn't for younger kids to hear. It has an advisory sticker, and you must be eighteen to get it. That doesn't mean younger kids won't get it, but I'm not responsible for every kid out there. I'm not a role model, and I don't claim to be."&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt;

==Lawsuits==
On September 17, 1999, Eminem's mother, Deborah Nelson, filed a $10 million lawsuit against him for [[slander]] based on his claim that she uses drugs in the line "I just found out my mom does more dope than I do" from "My Name Is".&lt;ref name="Bozza69"&gt;Bozza, 2003. p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thereal"&gt;{{cite news|title=INTERVIEW: Who's the real Slim Shady?|last=Verrico|first=Lisa|work=[[Scotland on Sunday]]|publisher=[[Johnston Press]]|date=January 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a two-year-long trial, she was awarded $25,000, of which she received $1,600 after legal fees.&lt;ref name="Bozza69"/&gt; Eminem was not surprised that his mother had filed the lawsuit against him, referring to her as a "lawsuit queen", and alleging that "That's how she makes money. When I was five, she had a job on the cash register at a store that sold chips and soda. Other than that, I don't remember her working a day in her life."&lt;ref name="Thereal"/&gt; She later filed another lawsuit against him for emotional damages suffered during the first trial, which was later dismissed.&lt;ref name="Bozza69"/&gt;

In December 2001, DeAngelo Bailey, a janitor living in [[Roseville, Michigan]] who was made the subject of the song "Brain Damage" in which he is portrayed as a school bully, filed a $1 million lawsuit against Eminem for slander and [[Expectation of privacy|invasion of privacy]].&lt;ref name="AllegedBully"/&gt; Bailey's attorney stated "Eminem is a Caucasian male who faced criticism within the music industry that he had not suffered through difficult circumstances growing up and he was therefore a 'pretender' in the industry&amp;nbsp;... Eminem used Bailey, his African-American childhood schoolmate, as a pawn in his effort to stem the tide of criticism."&lt;ref name="AllegedBully"/&gt; In 1982, Eminem's mother unsuccessfully sued the Roseville school district for not protecting her son, as she claimed that attacks from bullies caused him headaches, nausea, and antisocial behavior.&lt;ref name="AllegedBully"/&gt; Additionally, Bailey had previously admitted to bullying Eminem in the April 1999 issue of ''Rolling Stone Magazine''.&lt;ref name="BlowsUp"/&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed by judge [[Deborah Servitto]] in 2003, who rapped in her explanation that the lyrics—which include the school principal collaborating with Bailey, and Eminem's entire brain falling out of his head—were too exaggerated for a listener to believe that they were recalling an actual event.&lt;ref name="victim"/&gt; The verdict was upheld in 2005, and Bailey's lawyer ruled out any further appeals.&lt;ref name="victim"&gt;{{cite news|title=Eminem safe from bully's lawsuit|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4451583.stm|accessdate=June 17, 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=April 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003, 70-year-old widow Harlene Stein filed suit against Eminem and Dr. Dre on the grounds that "Guilty Conscience" contains an unauthorized sample of "Go Home Pigs" composed for the film ''[[Getting Straight]]'' by her husband, [[Ronald Stein]], who died in 1988.&lt;ref name="OldLady"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1478649/eminem-sued-over-sample.jhtml|title=Eminem Gets Sued&amp;nbsp;...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2623">'''Theatre practitioner''' is a modern term to describe someone who both creates [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]]s and who produces a [[theory|theoretical]] [[discourse]] that informs his or her practical work.&lt;ref&gt;Milling and Ley (2001, vi, 173) and Pavis (1998, 280). {{lang-de|Theaterpraktiker}}, {{lang-fr|praticien}}, {{lang-es|teatrista}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A theatre practitioner may be a [[Theatre director|director]], a [[dramatist]], an [[actor]], or—characteristically—often a combination of these traditionally-separate roles. "Theatre practice" describes the collective work that various theatre practitioners do.&lt;ref&gt;Pavis (1998, 392).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is not ordinarily applied to theatre-makers prior to the rise of [[modernism]] in the theatre, instead describing theatre [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] from [[Constantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]]'s development of his '[[Stanislavski's 'system'|system]]', through [[Vsevolod Meyerhold|Meyerhold]]'s [[Biomechanics (Meyerhold)|biomechanics]], [[Antonin Artaud]]'s [[Theatre of cruelty]], [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s [[Epic theatre|epic]] and [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s [[poor theatre]], down to the present day, with contemporary theatre practitioners including [[Augusto Boal]] with his [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], [[Dario Fo]]'s popular theatre, [[Eugenio Barba]]'s theatre anthropology and [[Anne Bogart]]'s [[viewpoints]].&lt;ref&gt;McCullough (1996, 15-36) and Milling and Ley (2001, vii, 175).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Time Squad''''' is an American children's animated television series created by [[Dave Wasson]] for [[Cartoon Network]], and the 10th of the network's [[Cartoon Cartoons]]. It follows the adventures of Otto Osworth, Buck Tuddrussel, and the robot Larry 3000, a trio of hapless "time cops" living in the far distant future who [[time travel|travel back in time]] attempting to correct the course of history. During their adventures, they run into major [[historical figure]]s such as [[Julius Caesar]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], and [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]], who have taken a drastically different course of life than history dictates. The mission of the Time Squad is to guide these figures onto the correct path and ensure the integrity of the future.

The series premiered during Cartoon Network's marathon block "Cartoon Cartoon Summer" on June 8, 2001, and ended after two seasons on November 26, 2003, airing 26 episodes in total. In the course of its run, the series received five [[Annie Award]] nominations. Creator Dave Wasson described the series as "a C-student's guide to history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cartoon Net Gives Go to 4 New Shows|first=Paula|last=Bernstein|url=https://variety.com/2001/tv/news/cartoon-net-gives-go-to-4-new-shows-1117794058/|date=February 21, 2001|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the final Cartoon Network original series to premiere during [[Betty Cohen]]'s tenure, as she later resigned due to creative disagreements with [[Jamie Kellner]], then-head of [[Turner Broadcasting System]].

==Overview==
The show is set in the year 100,000,000 AD, on a satellite which orbits Earth. This future Earth is never visited directly, though it is referred in dialogue as a peaceful [[utopia]] where there are no longer any problems to solve. All nations of the world have merged into one, and according to Tuddrussel, there are "no wars, no pollution, and [[bacon]] is good for your [[heart]]".

Despite this cheerful vision of the future, the space station on which the characters live and from which they travel to the past is remarkably [[dystopia|dystopic]]. It features a shooting range, a [[terrarium]] and a prison for repeat offenders, but it is dank, outdated (for the time) and unclean. Mostly this seems to be down to officer Buck Tuddrussel ([[Rob Paulsen]]), a scruffy and immature perennial bachelor, who nevertheless happens to be the station's most senior officer.

The only other official member of Buck's unit is Larry 3000 ([[Mark Hamill]]), a translator robot and former diplomat who was rendered more or less obsolete when all of the world's nations merged. Buck's mindless machismo clashes with Larry's effete sensibilities, and the two bicker terribly. Added to this the fact that neither of them has any great knowledge of history, they made a rather poor team together.

However, when they encounter Otto Osworth ([[Pamela Adlon]]), an 8-year-old boy who happens to be an orphan from the 21st century, he is quickly recruited and added to the team. Otto is shown to be the only one on the team with any enthusiasm or competence for the job. The problem is, neither of the other two are particularly willing to listen to his advice, and he must often resort to trickery to make sure the mission is completed.

The Time Squad organization is set up to ensure that history is maintained and the future protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Eli Whitney's Flesh-Eating Mistake|series=Time Squad|network=Cartoon Network|date=June 8, 2001|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Larry 3000, "time is like a rope", and, as it is woven at one end, ages and gradually unravels and frays at the other. In the context of the show, this often means that historical figures have made different, sometimes [[Anachronism|anachronistic]], choices in life (see [[free will]]), and as such will not be able to fulfill the role that history says they fulfilled (an example of this [[Henry Ford]] did not invent the automobile assembly line due to constant hostility of the [[Dodo Bird|dodo birds]] that never became extinct). According to creator Dave Wasson, "We started by basically knowing what a guy did in history, then found the most outlandish way he could go wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Time Squad' Aims to Rewrite History|first=Bill|last=Keveney|date=June 8, 2001|work=[[USA Today]]|section=Life|page=15E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==

===Main characters===
* {{anchor|Otto Osworth}}Otto Osworth (voiced by [[Pamela Adlon]]): An orphan illegally traveling along with Tuddrussel and Larry, taken on board due to their incompetence and his impressive historical knowledge (and for Otto to escape his brutal life at the orphanage). Despite being a bookworm, his demeanor is far from boring; he is just as childlike and jocular as any regular eight-year-old. Even though he is the youngest, he is also the most responsible out of the squad, being the only one pure enough to not let himself get swayed by temptations. Depending on who he's siding with, he can either become loud and destructive (when Tuddrussel has him company) or composed and calm (when it's Larry he agrees with). It's unknown what happened to Otto's parents.
* {{anchor|Larry 3000}}Lawrence "Larry" 3000 (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]): A grumpy robot and the only one on board able to operate the computer. It's his job to make sure the squad ends up at the right time and place. Initially, he was programmed as a polyglotic robot for diplomatic purposes; when all of the nations rejoiced into one, huge country, his consular abilities were no longer needed. Larry is famous for his effeminate behaviour and interests, which are portrayed all but subtly. Unusually, he is extremely dramatic and open in showing his emotions whilst still being the snarkiest of the trio. He prides himself in having knowledge of proper etiquette and manners. For Otto, he has been repeatedly depicted as a maternal figure.
* {{anchor|Buck Tuddrussel}}Beauregard "Buck" Tuddrussel (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]): An immature time cop, who possesses all the physical requirements for his job and none the intellectual. Whenever there's someone who needs a beating up (and even when they do not), he's the best person to get assigned for such a task. Impulsiveness, aggressiveness and air-headedness are traits which define Tuddrussel quite nicely. Not much of his backstory is known, aside from his Southern heritage and a short-lived marriage to fellow time cop Sheila Sternwell.

===Recurring===
* {{anchor|Sheila Sternwell}}Sheila Sternwell Tudrussel (voiced by Mari Weiss): A lieutenant within Time Squad ranks, Sheila is a no-nonsense woman that takes her job seriously. The ex-wife of Tuddrussel, it's made clear that while she regrets making the mistake of marrying him in the first place, and can be slightly bitter towards him, she does not actually resent him and still does her job and helps out Tuddrussel and his unit when needed. She even seems to go far in not ratting out Tuddrussel and Larry over Otto, and other screw ups that she should be reporting.
* {{anchor|XJ5}}XJ5 (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]): An advanced robot that is more qualified for the job of a time cop than Larry, and he loves to rub it in. Working with Officer Sternwell, XJ5 provides actual help and guidance on missions.
* {{anchor|J.T. Laser}}J.T. Laser (voiced by [[Jim Wise]]): Professional and competent, J.T. is the best officer of what Time Squad has to offer; but he is also an arrogant jerk that gladly makes trouble for Tuddrussel and Larry.
* {{anchor|Lance Nine Trillion}}Lance Nine Trillion (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]): A high-tech robot in Time Squad that provides with the most ranked officer. Lance is the perfect (obnoxious) partner for J.T.
* {{anchor|Sister Thornley}}Sister Thornley (voiced by [[Dee Dee Rescher]]): Otto's former caretaker and nasty [[nun]] of the show before getting "adopted" by Larry and Tuddrussel. Otto had good reason to fear her, as did the other kids that she kept. Obviously not afraid of the police or anyone coming after her, Sister Thornley freely abuses kids that are put into her care, while at the orphanage and even more disturbingly in public. Her motives are despairingly questionable, such making the children work under horrific conditions in order to make a quick buck, or why she had a problem with Otto reading books (or any child reading, for that matter. She apparently had an entire policy against it). At the end, Larry and Tuddrussel officially takes Otto much to her dismay, but to her joy she finds another genius child she could abuse.
