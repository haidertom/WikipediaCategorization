Originally developed by Drs. Rick Luettich and Joannes Westerink,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luettich|first1=Rick|last2=Westerink|first2=Joannes|last3=Scheffner|first3=Norman|title=ADCIRC: An Advanced Three-Dimensional Circulation Model for Shelves, Coasts, and Estuaries.

Report 2. User's Manual for ADCIRC-2DDI|date=January 1994|publisher=Coastal Engineering Research Center|location=Vicksburg MS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the model is developed and maintained by a combination of academic, governmental, and corporate partners, including the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], the [[University of Notre Dame]], and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|US Army Corps of Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adcirc.org/community/developers/development-group/ ADCIRC Development Group]. Retrieved on 27 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ADCIRC system includes an independent multi-algorithmic wind forecast model and also has advanced coupling capabilities, allowing it to integrate effects from sediment transport, ice, waves, surface runoff, and baroclinicity.

== Access ==
The model is free, with source code made available by request via the website&lt;ref name=adcircwebsite /&gt;, allowing users to run the model on any system with a [[List of compilers#Fortran compilers|Fortran compiler]]. A pre-compiled [[Windows]] version of the model can also be purchased alongside the [[SMS (hydrology software)]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aquaveo.com/software/sms-adcirc SMS ADCIRC website]. Retrieved 27 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;. ADCIRC is coded in [[Fortran]], and can be used with native [[binary file|binary]], [[ASCII|text]], or [[netCDF]] file formats.  

== Capabilities ==
The model formulation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/ims/adcirc/adcirc_theory_2004_12_08.pdf ADCIRC Theory Report]. Retrieved on 27 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;
is based on the [[shallow water equations]], solving the [[continuity equation#fluid dynamics|continuity equation]] (represented in the form of the Generalized Wave Continuity Equation&lt;ref name="Kinnmark1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kinnmark|first1=Ingemar|title=The Shallow Water Wave Equations: Formulation, Analysis and Application|volume=15|year=1986|issn=0176-5035|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-82646-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
and the momentum equations (with [[Cauchy momentum equation#Convective acceleration|advective]], [[Coriolis force|Coriolis]], [[viscosity#Eddy viscosity|eddy viscosity]], and [[shear stress#shear stress in fluids|surface stress]] terms included).  ADCIRC utilizes the [[finite element method]] in either three-dimensional or two-dimensional depth-integrated form on a triangular [[unstructured grid]] with [[Cartesian Coordinate System|Cartesian]] or [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical]] coordinates. It can run in either [[Barotropic fluid|barotropic]] or [[baroclinic]] modes, allowing inclusion of changes in water density and properties such as salinity and temperature. ADCIRC can be run either in serial mode (e.g. on a personal computer) or in parallel on [[supercomputer|supercomputers]] via [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]]. The model has been optimized to be [[parallel algorithm#parallelizability|highly parallelized]], in order to facilitate rapid computation of large, complex problems.&lt;ref name="KerrDonahue2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=P.

ADCIRC is able to apply several different bottom friction formulations including [[Manning formula|Manning's n]]-based bottom drag due to changes in land coverage (such as forests, cities, and seafloor composition), as well as utilize atmospheric forcing data (wind stress and atmospheric pressure) from several sources, and further reduce the strength of the wind forcing due to [[roughness length|surface roughness]] effects.&lt;ref name="WesterinkLuettich2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Westerink|first1=Joannes J.|last2=Luettich|first2=Richard A.|last3=Feyen|first3=Jesse C.|last4=Atkinson|first4=John H.|last5=Dawson|first5=Clint|last6=Roberts|first6=Hugh J.|last7=Powell|first7=Mark D.|last8=Dunion|first8=Jason P.|last9=Kubatko|first9=Ethan J.|last10=Pourtaheri|first10=Hasan|title=A Basin- to Channel-Scale Unstructured Grid Hurricane Storm Surge Model Applied to Southern Louisiana|journal=Monthly Weather Review|volume=136|issue=3|year=2008|pages=833–864|issn=0027-0644|doi=10.1175/2007MWR1946.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DietrichBunya2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dietrich|first1=J.

The model is also able to incorporate effects such as time-varying topography and bathymetry, boundary fluxes from rivers or other sources, tidal potential, and sub-grid scale features like levees. 

ADCIRC is frequently coupled to a [[wind wave model]] such as STWAVE, [http://swanmodel.sourceforge.net/ SWAN], or [[Wind wave model#WAVEWATCH|WAVEWATCH III]], especially in storm surge applications where [[radiation stress|wave radiation stress]] can have important effects on ocean circulation and vice versa. In these applications, the model is able to take advantage of tight coupling with wave models to increase calculation accuracy.&lt;ref name="DietrichBunya2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BunyaDietrich2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunya|first1=S.|last2=Dietrich|first2=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5087">In [[second-language acquisition]], the '''Acculturation Model''' is a theory proposed by John Schumann to describe the acquisition process of a second language (L2) by members of ethnic minorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellis |first= Rod |authorlink=Rod Ellis |title=The Study of Second Language Acquisition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KglibyrZ5sC&amp;pg=PA230 |accessdate= |year=1994 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn= 0-19-437189-1 |page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; that typically include immigrants, migrant workers, or the children of such groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (1994), p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; This acquisition process takes place in natural contexts of majority language setting. The main suggestion of the theory is that the acquisition of a second language is directly linked to the acculturation process, and learners’ success is determined by the extent to which they can orient themselves to the target language culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= VanPatten |first=Bill |authorlink= |title=Key Terms in Second Language Acquisition |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KO-ZDi_lpYIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=ja&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2010 |publisher= Continuum|location= |isbn=9780826499158 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The acculturation model came into light with Schumann’s study of six non-English learners where one learner named Alberto, unlike the other five, had little progress in the acquisition process of [[English Language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631214823_chunk_g97806312148235_ss1-2 |title= Acculturation |author= |date= |work=Blackwell Reference Online |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Inc |doi=10.1111/b.9780631214823.1999.x |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The process of acculturation was defined by Brown as "the process of being adapted to a new culture" which involves a new orientation of thinking and feeling on the part of an L2 learner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=H. Douglas |title=Principles of Language Learning and Teaching |url= |accessdate= |year=1994 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall Regents]] |location=[[New Jersey]] |isbn= 0-13-191966-0 |pages=169–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brown, as culture is an integral part of a human being, the process of acculturation takes a deeper turn when the issue of language is brought on the scene. Schumann based his Acculturation Model on two sets of factors: social and psychological. Schumann asserts that the degree to which the second-language learners acculturate themselves towards the culture of target-language (TL) group generally depends on social and psychological factors; and these two sorts of factors will determine respectively the level of ''social distance'' and ''psychological distance'' an L2 learner is having in course of his learning the target-language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schumann |first=John H |title=The Pidginization Process: A Model for Second Language Acquisition |url= |accessdate= |year=1978 |publisher=Newbury House Publishers|location=Rowley |pages=367–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social distance, as Ellis notes, concerns the extent to which individual learners can identify themselves with members of TL group and, thereby, can achieve contact with them. Psychological distance is the extent to which individual learners are at ease with their target-language learning task.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (1994), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Schumann identifies eight factors that influence social distance: social dominance, integration pattern, enclosure, cohesiveness, size factor, cultural congruence, attitude factor, and intended length of residence. He also identifies three factors that influence psychological distance: motivation, attitude, and culture shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3203534|title=The pidginization process : a model for second language acquisition|last=H.|first=Schumann, John|date=1978|publisher=Newbury House Publishers|isbn=0883770962|location=Rowley, Mass.|oclc=3203534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumann later sought to extend the acculturation model by assessing contemporary cognitive models for second language acquisition, including McLaughlin’s cognitive theory, Hatch and Hawkins’ experiential approach, Bialystok and Ryan’s model of knowledge and control dimensions, Anderson’s active control of thought framework, and Gasser's connectionist lexical memory framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schumann|first=John|date=Winter 1990|title=Extending the Scope of the Acculturation/Pidginization Model to Include Cognition|url=https://www.jstor.org.proxy-bc.researchport.umd.edu/stable/3587114|journal=TESOL Quarterly|volume=24|issue=4|pages=667–684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred Swaine Taylor''' (11 December 1806 in [[Northfleet]], Kent – 27 May 1880 in [[London]]) was an English [[toxicologist]] and medical writer, who has been called the "father of British forensic medicine"&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, Louis, [http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/reprint/31/7/1235 'Alfred Swaine Taylor (1806–1880), pioneer toxicologist – and a slight case of murder'],''Clinical Chemistry'' 31:7 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/4355 Alfred Swaine Taylor]. Royal College of Physicians of London (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an early experimenter in photography.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Roger, ''Impressed by Light. British Photographs from Paper Negatives, 1840-1860'', (Yale University Press, 2007), p.378.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor studied medicine at [[Guy's Hospital]] and [[St Thomas's Hospital]] and was appointed Lecturer in Medical Jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital in 1831. In 1832 he succeeded Alexander Barry as joint Lecturer on Chemistry with [[Arthur Aitken]]. He published textbooks on [[medical jurisprudence]] and [[toxicology]], contributed to the ''[[Dublin Quarterly Journal]]'' and medical periodicals, and edited the ''[[Medical Gazette]]''. He appeared as expert witness in several widely reported murder cases. He also developed the use of [[hyposulphate of lime]] as a fixing agent for photography.

'''Animal studies''' is a recently recognized field in which animals are studied in a variety of cross-disciplinary ways. Scholars who engage in animal studies may be formally trained in a number of diverse fields, including [[geography]], [[art history]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[film studies]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[literary studies]], [[museology]], [[philosophy]], communication, and [[sociology]]. They may engage with questions about literal animals, or about notions of "animality" or "brutality," employing various theoretical perspectives, including [[feminism]], [[Marxist theory]], and [[queer theory]]. Using these perspectives, those who engage in animal studies seek to understand both human-animal relations now and in the past, and to understand animals as beings-in-themselves, separate from our knowledge of them. Because the field is still developing, scholars and others have some freedom to define their own criteria about what issues may structure the field.

==History==
As an interdisciplinary subject, animal studies exists at the intersection of a number of different fields of study. Different fields began to turn to animals as an important topic at different times and for various reasons, and these separate disciplinary histories shape how scholars approach animal studies.

In part, animal studies developed out of the [[animal liberation movement]] and was grounded in [[ethics|ethical]] questions about co-existence with other species: whether it is moral to eat animals, to do scientific research on animals for human benefit, and so on. Animal studies scholars who explore the field from an ethical perspective frequently cite [[Australian]] philosopher [[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 work, ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'',&lt;ref name="Gorman"&gt;{{cite web |author=Gorman, James |date=12 January 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/science/animal-studies-move-from-the-lab-to-the-lecture-hall.html?pagewanted=all |title=Animal Studies Move From the Lab to the Lecture Hall |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a founding document in animal studies.  Singer's work followed [[Jeremy Bentham#Animal rights|Jeremy Bentham]]'s by trying to expand [[utilitarian]] questions about pleasure and pain beyond humans to other [[sentience|sentient]] creatures.

Theorists interested in the role of animals in literature, culture, and [[Continental philosophy]] also consider the late work of [[Jacques Derrida]] a driving force behind the rise of interest in animal studies in the humanities.&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt;  Derrida's final lecture series, ''The Animal That Therefore I Am'', examined how interactions with animal life affect human attempts to define humanity and the self through language. Taking up Derrida's deconstruction and extending it to other cultural territory, [[Cary Wolfe]] published ''Animal Rites'' in 2003 and critiqued earlier animal rights philosophers such as [[Peter Singer]] and Thomas Regan. Wolfe's study points out an insidious humanism at play in their philosophies and others. Recently also the Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] published a book on the question of the animal: ''The Open. Man and Animal''.

==Research topics and methodologies==
Researchers in animal studies examine the questions and issues that arise when traditional modes of [[Humanities|humanistic]] and [[Science|scientific]] inquiry begin to take animals seriously as subjects of thought and activity.  Students of animal studies may examine how humanity is defined in relation to animals, or how representations of animals create understandings (and misunderstandings) of other species. In order to do so, animal studies pays close attention to the ways that humans [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] animals, and asks how humans might avoid bias in observing other creatures. For instance, [[Donna Haraway]]'s book, ''Primate Visions'', examines how [[diorama]]s created for the [[American Museum of Natural History]] showed family groupings that conformed to the traditional human [[nuclear family]], which misrepresented the animals' observed behavior in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donna |last=Haraway |authorlink=Donna_Haraway |jstor=466593 |title=Teddy Bear Patriarchy: Taxidermy in the Garden of Eden, New York City, 1908–1936 |journal=Social Text |issue=11 |date=Winter 1984–1985 |pages=20–64 |publisher=Duke University Press |doi = 10.2307/466593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical approaches in animal studies have also considered representations of non-human animals in popular culture, including species diversity in animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}}, eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt;

By highlighting these issues, animal studies strives to re-examine traditional [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] categories in the context of a renewed attention to and respect for animal life. The assumption that focusing on animals might clarify human knowledge is neatly expressed in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s famous dictum that animals are "good to think."&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Totemism''. Boston: Beacon Press, 1963, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Batrachology''' is the branch of [[zoology]] concerned with the study of [[amphibian]]s including [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[salamander]]s, [[newt]]s, and [[caecilian]]s. It is a sub-discipline of [[herpetology]], which includes also non-avian [[Reptile|reptiles]] ([[snake]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[amphisbaenia|amphisbaenids]], [[turtle]]s, [[terrapin]]s, [[tortoise]]s, [[crocodilia|crocodilians]], and the [[tuatara]]). '''Batrachologists''' may study the [[evolution]], [[ecology]], [[ethology]], or [[anatomy]] of amphibians.

Amphibians are [[Ectotherm|cold blooded]] vertebrates largely found in damp habitats although many species have special behavioural adaptations that allow them to live in deserts, trees, underground and in regions with wide seasonal variations in temperature. There are over 7250 [[species]] of amphibians.&lt;ref name="AmphibiaWeb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/ |title=AmphibiaWeb |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5638">A '''bibliogram''' is a verbal construct made when [[noun phrase]]s from extended stretches of text are ranked high to low by their [[frequency (statistics)|frequency]] of [[co-occurrence]] with one or more user-supplied seed terms. Each bibliogram has three components:

* A seed term that sets a [[wiktionary:context|context]].
* Words that co-occur with the seed across some set of records.
* Counts (frequencies) by which co-occurring words can be ordered high to low.

The term was introduced in 2005 by [[Howard D. White]] to name the linguistic object studied, but not previously named, in [[informetrics]], [[scientometrics]] and [[bibliometrics]]. The noun phrases in the [[ranking]] may be authors, journals, subject headings, or other indexing terms. The "stretches of text” may be a book, a set of related articles, a subject bibliography, a set of Web pages, and so on. Bibliograms are always generated from writings, usually from scholarly or scientific literature.

As a family of term-frequency distributions, the bibliogram has frequently been written about under  descriptions such as:

* positive skew distribution
* empirical hyperbolic
* scale-free (see also [[Scale-free network]])
* [[power law]]
* [[size frequency distribution]]
* reverse-J

It is sometimes called a "core and scatter" distribution. The "core" consists of relatively few top-ranked terms that account for a disproportionately large share of co-occurrences overall.

The "scatter” consists of relatively many lower-ranked terms that account for the remaining share of co-occurrences. Usually the top-ranked terms are not tied in frequency, but identical frequencies and tied ranks become more common as the frequencies get smaller. At the bottom of the distribution, a long tail of terms are tied in rank because each co-occurs with the seed term only once.

In most cases bibliograms can be described by [[power law]]s such as [[Zipf's law]] and [[Bradford's law]]. In this regard, they have long been studied by mathematicians and statisticians in information science. However, these treatments typically ignore the qualitative meanings of the ranked terms themselves, which are often of interest in their own right. For example, the following bibliogram was made with an author's name as seed and shows the descriptors that co-occur with her name in the [[ERIC]] database. The descriptors are ranked by how many of her articles they were used to index:

 6   Creativity
 4   Creativity Tests
 3   Divergent Thinking
 2   Elementary School Mathematics
 2   Instruction
 2   Mathematics Education
 2   Problem Solving
 2   Research
 2   Time
 1   Acceleration
 1   Anxiety
 1   Beginning Teachers
 1   Behavioral Objectives
 1   Child Development
 1   Classroom Techniques
 1   Cognitive Development
     etc.

This author is a researcher in education, and it will be seen that the terms profile her intellectual interests over the years. In general, bibliograms can be used to:

* suggest additional terms for search strategies
* characterize the work of scholars, scientists, or institutions
* show who an author cites over time
* show who cites an author over time
* show the other authors with whom an author is co-cited over time
* show the subjects associated with a journal or an author
* show the authors, organizations, or journals associated with a subject
* show library classification codes associated with subject headings and vice versa
* show the popularity of items in the collections of libraries
* model the structure of literatures with title terms, descriptors, author names, journal names  

Bibliograms can be created with the RANK command on Dialog (other vendors have similar commands), ranking options within [[WorldCat]], [[Histcite|HistCite]], [[Google Scholar]], and inexpensive content analysis software.

White suggests that bibliograms have a parallel construct in what he calls ''associograms''. These are the rank-ordered lists of word association norms studied in [[psycholinguistics]]. They are similar to bibliograms in statistical structure but are not generated from writings. Rather, they are generated by presenting panels of people with a stimulus term (which functions like a seed term) and tabulating the words they associate with the seed by frequency of co-occurrence. They are currently of interest to information scientists as a nonstandard way of creating thesauri for document retrieval.

==Examples==
Other examples of bibliograms are the ordered set of an author's [[co-authors]] or the list of authors that are published in a specific journal together with their number of articles. A popular example is the list of additional titles to consider for purchase that you get when you search an item in [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]. These suggested titles are the top terms in the "core" of a bibliogram formed with your search term as seed. The frequencies are counts of the times they have been co-purchased with the seed.

Examples of associagrams may be found in the [http://www.eat.rl.ac.uk/ Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus].

==Other methods==
Similar but different methods are used in [[data clustering]] and [[data mining]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060612215241/http://labs.google.com/sets Google Sets] does also create list of associated terms to a given set of terms.

The '''{{lang|nl|Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica}}''' (abbr. '''CWI'''; English: "National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science") is a research center in the field of [[mathematics]] and  [[theoretical computer science]]. It is  part of the [[Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] (NWO) and is located at the [[Amsterdam Science Park]]. This institute is famous as the creation ground of the [[Python Programming Language]]. It was a founding member of the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics ([[ERCIM]]).

==Early history==
The institute was founded in 1946 by [[Johannes van der Corput]], [[David van Dantzig]], [[Jurjen Koksma]], [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers]], [[Marcel Minnaert]] and [[Jan Arnoldus Schouten]]. It was originally called ''Mathematical Centre'' (in Dutch: ''Mathematisch Centrum''). One early mission was to develop mathematical prediction models to assist large Dutch engineering projects, such as the  [[Delta Works]]. During this early period, the Mathematics Institute also helped with designing the wings of the [[Fokker F27 Friendship]] airplane, voted in 2006 as the most beautiful Dutch design of the 20th century.{{Citation needed |date=December 2013}}

The computer science component developed soon after. [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]], considered the founder of computer science (or ''informatica'') in the Netherlands, was the director of the institute for almost 20 years. [[Edsger Dijkstra]] did most of his early influential work on algorithms and formal methods at CWI. The first Dutch computers, the [[Electrologica X1]] and [[Electrologica X8]], were both designed at the centre, and [[Electrologica]] was created as a spinoff to manufacture the machines.

In 1983, the name of the institute was changed to CWI to reflect a governmental push for emphasizing computer science research in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Bennie Mols: ''ERCOM: The Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica turns 60.'' In: Newsletter of the European Mathematical Society, No. 56 (September 2007), p. 43 ([https://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2007-09-65.pdf online])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent research==
The institute is known for its work in fields such as [[operations research]], [[software engineering]], information processing, and mathematical applications in [[life sciences]] and [[logistics]].
More recent examples of research results from CWI include the development of scheduling algorithms for the Dutch railway system (the [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]], one of the busiest rail networks in the world) and the development of the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]] by [[Guido van Rossum]]. Python has played an important role in the development of the [[Google platform|Google search platform]] from the beginning, and it continues to do so as the system grows and evolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://python.org/about/quotes/ |title=Quotes about Python |publisher=Python.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Many information retrieval techniques used by packages such as [[SPSS]] were initially developed by Data Distilleries, a CWI [[Corporate spin-off|spinoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloorresearch.com/analysis/spss-and-data-distilleries/ |title=SPSS and Data Destileries |publisher=Python.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224133541/http://www.bloorresearch.com/analysis/spss-and-data-distilleries/# |archive-date=2015-02-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sumath |last2=Sivanandam |first1=S |first2=S.N. |date=2006 |title=Introduction to Data Mining and its Applications

Work at the institute was recognized by national or international research awards, such as the [[Lanchester Prize]] (awarded yearly by [[INFORMS]]), the [[Gödel Prize]] (awarded by [[ACM SIGACT]]) or the [[Spinoza Prize]]. Most of its senior researchers hold part-time professorships at other Dutch universities, with the institute producing over 170 full professors during the course of its history. Several CWI researchers have been recognized as members of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Academia Europaea]], or as knights in the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cwi.nl/news/2013/cwi-lectures-organized-in-honour-of-mathematician-lex-schrijver |title=Lex Schrijver receives EURO Gold Medal 2015 |publisher=cwi |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, CWI in association with [[Google]] announced a successful [[collision attack]] on [[SHA 1]] encryption algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html Announcing the first SHA1 collision]&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Internet==
CWI was an early user of the [[Internet]] in Europe. The first connection in Europe to the [[NSFnet]] network, which later developed into the Internet, was established at CWI on 17 November 1988 by [[Piet Beertema]], and cwi.nl was the first national [[domain name]] ever issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [https://www.sidn.nl/over-sidn/geschiedenis/ De geschiedenis van SIDN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727033624/https://www.sidn.nl/over-sidn/geschiedenis/ |date=2013-07-27 }} (History of SIDN), [http://www.sidn.nl Official website] of SIDN&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amsterdam Internet Exchange]] (one of the largest Internet Exchanges in the world, in terms of both members and throughput traffic) is located at the neighbouring [[Stichting Academisch Rekencentrum Amsterdam|SARA]] (an early CWI spin-off) and [[NIKHEF]] institutes. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) office for the Benelux countries is located at CWI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3c.nl |title=The World Wide Web Consortium  - Benelux Office |publisher= W3C |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-off companies==
CWI has demonstrated a continuing effort to put the work of its researchers at the disposal of society, mainly by collaborating with commercial companies and creating spin-off businesses. In 2000 CWI established "CWI Incubator BV", a dedicated company with the aim to generate high tech spin-off companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cwi.nl/general/spinoff-companies |title=Spin-off companies' details |publisher=CWI Amsterdam |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the CWI spinoffs include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cwi.nl/sharing-knowledge/spin-offs |title=Spin-off companies |publisher=CWI Amsterdam |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Septic tank EN.svg|thumb|right|Scheme of a cesspit which is constructed like an underground holding tank]]
A '''cesspit''' (or '''cesspool''' or '''soak pit''' in some contexts), is a term with various meanings: it is used to describe either an underground holding tank (sealed at the bottom) or a soak pit (not sealed at the bottom).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies - (2nd Revised 2rEdition)|author1=Tilley, E. |author2=Ulrich, L. |author3=Lüthi, C. |author4=Reymond, Ph. |author5=Zurbrügg, C. |publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used for the temporary collection and storage of [[Human feces|feces]], excreta or fecal sludge as part of an on-site [[sanitation]] system and has some similarities with [[septic tank]]s or with soak pits. Traditionally, it was a deep cylindrical chamber dug into the earth, having approximate dimensions of 1 metre diameter and 2–3 metres depth. Their appearance was similar to that of a hand-dug water well.

The pit can be lined with bricks or concrete, covered with a slab and needing to be emptied frequently when it is used like an underground holding tank.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In other cases (if soil and [[groundwater]] conditions allow), it is not constructed watertight, to allow liquid to leach out (similar to a [[pit latrine]] or to a soak pit).

== Uses ==
[[File:Cess Pool in Slovakia.jpg|thumb|An empty, old cesspool in Slovakia]]
=== Holding tank ===
In the UK a cesspit is a sealed tank for the reception and temporary storage of [[sewage]]; in North America this is simply referred to as a "[[holding tank]]". Because it is sealed, the tank must be emptied frequently &amp;mdash; in many cases as often as weekly. Because of the need for frequent emptying, the cost of maintenance of a cesspit can be very high.

=== Infiltration systems ===
A cesspool was at one time{{when|date=April 2016}} built like a [[dry well]] lined with loose-fitting brick or stone, used for the disposal of sewage via infiltration into the soil. Liquids leaked out through the soil as conditions allowed, while solids decayed and collected as  composted matter in the base of the cesspool. As the solids accumulated, eventually the particulate solids blocked the escape of liquids, causing the cesspool to drain more slowly or to overflow.

A [[biofilm]] forms in the loose soil surrounding a cesspool or [[pit latrine]] which provides some degree of attenuation of the pollutants present, but a very deep cesspool can allow raw sewage to directly enter [[groundwater]] with minimal biological cleansing, leading to [[groundwater pollution]] and undrinkable water supplies.  It is for this reason that deep water wells on the property must be drilled far from the cesspool.

Most residential waste cesspools in use in the US today are rudimentary septic systems, consisting of a concrete-capped pit lined with [[concrete masonry unit]]s (cinder blocks) laid on their sides with perforated [[drain field]] piping ([[weeping tile]]) extending outward below the level of the intake connection. The concrete cover will often have a cleanout pipe extending above ground. Some are constructed with concrete walls on one or more sides.

The waste cesspool is vulnerable to overloading or flooding by heavy rains or snow melt because it is not enclosed and sealed like conventional septic tank systems. It is also vulnerable to the entry of tree roots which can eventually cause the system to fail.

== Regulations ==
Modern environmental regulations either discourage or ban the use of cesspools, and instead connections to municipal [[Sanitary sewer|sewage systems]] or [[septic tank]]s are encouraged or required.

In many countries, planning and development regulations for the protection of the watershed prevent home-owners who live close to rivers and environmentally sensitive areas from installing a [[septic system]], requiring a holding tank instead.

=== United States ===
In some localities in the U.S., existing rural residential waste cesspools are "[[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]]" or allowed to continue operations until they no longer function. Once defunct, they must be disconnected and replaced by modern septic systems. In areas that have a higher than usual [[water table]] or fail a [[percolation test]], an above-ground drain field waste disposal system may be installed instead.

In the case of sale or transfer of residential property that uses an existing waste cesspool system, local laws may differ. Some counties or jurisdictions do not permit the sale of residential property that utilizes a waste cesspool. Other counties or villages may recognize the "grandfather clause" and allow the property sale or transfer.

=== Europe ===
In France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland, cesspits are forbidden.

== History ==
{{seealso|History of water supply and sanitation}}
===United States===
The typical American urbanite in the 1870s relied on the rural solution of individual well and outhouse (privy) or cesspools. Baltimore in the 1880s smelled "like a billion [[polecat]]s," according to [[H. L. Mencken]], and a [[Chicago]]an said in his city "the stink is enough to knock you down." Improvement was slow, and large cities of the East and South depended to the end of the century mainly on drainage through open gutters. Pollution of water supplies by [[sewage]] as well as dumping of [[industrial waste]] accounted in large measures for the public health records and staggering mortality rates of the period.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The National Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
Cesspits were introduced to Europe in the 16th century, at a time when urban populations were growing at a faster rate than in the past. The added burden of waste volume began overloading urban street gutters, where [[chamber pot]]s were emptied each day. There was no regulation of cesspit construction until the 18th century, when a need to address sanitation and safety concerns became apparent. Cesspits were cleaned out by tradesmen using shovels and horse-drawn wagons. Cesspools were cleaned only at night, to reduce the smell and annoyance to the public. The typical cesspit was cleaned out once every 8 to 10 years. Fermentation of the solid waste collecting in cesspits, however, resulted in dangerous infections and gases that sometimes asphyxiated cesspit cleaners. Cesspits began to be cleaned out more regularly, but strict regulations for cesspit construction and ventilation were not introduced until the 1800s.&lt;ref name="La Berge 2002 207–9"&gt;{{cite book|last=La Berge|first=Ann Elizabeth Fowler|title=Mission and Method: The Early Nineteenth-Century French Public Health Movement|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521527019|pages=207–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before construction reforms were introduced in the early 19th century, liquid waste would seep away through the ground, leaving solid waste behind in the cesspit. While this made removal of solid waste easier, the seeping liquid waste often contaminated well water sources, creating public health problems. Municipal reforms required that cesspits be built of solid walls of stone and concrete. This kept liquid waste in the cesspit, forcing cesspits to be cleaned more frequently, on average two or three times per year. Liquid cesspit waste would be removed with pumps by cesspit cleaners, and then solid waste, valuable as fertilizer and for manufacturing [[ammonia]], was removed.&lt;ref name="La Berge 2002 207–9" /&gt; 
 
In 1846, French public hygienist [[Alphone Guérard]] estimated that 100 cesspits were cleaned in Paris every night, by 200-250 total cesspit cleaners in the city, and out of a total of 30,000 cesspits. The replacement of Paris' cesspit system was challenged for decades by officials not on public hygiene grounds, but on economic ones, based on the desire to conserve human waste as fertilizer rather than disposing of it in a modern sewer system. Paris' sewer system began modernizing in the 1880s, with the conversion of storm sewers for public sewage. Some cesspits were still in use in Paris into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=La Berge|first=Ann Elizabeth Fowler|title=Mission and Method: The Early Nineteenth-Century French Public Health Movement|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521527019|pages=209, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society and culture ==

=== Accidents ===
In Suffolk County, on Long Island, [[New York (state)|New York]], most households still use cesspools for waste drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Shovel Ready|date=2011-01-24|url=http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/Straggler/098.html|author=[[John Derbyshire]]|journal=[[National Review]]|volume=63|issue=1|page=55|issn=0028-0038|department=The Straggler}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cesspool collapses have occurred in this area, for example on December 8, 2009. Two workers in a decommissioned cesspit were trapped, subsequently leading to a two-hour rescue mission. Since 1998, six cases of cesspools collapsing and sucking in human residents that were standing over them have been reported, injuring a total of seven people, killing one in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,192807,00.html|title=Man, Son, Neighbor Sucked Into N.Y.

On June 1, 2011, two teenagers from [[Farmingville, New York|Farmingville]] in [[Long Island, New York]], drowned after becoming overwhelmed by fumes and trapped in a backyard cesspool measuring 16-feet deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/02/us-fatal-cesspool-idUSTRE7516AP20110602|title=Two teens die after trapped in backyard cesspool on Long Island|date=|work=Reuters|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapsing cesspools were mostly due to older cesspools built with brick or [[cinder block]]. These structures weakened over their lifespan leading to increased risk of collapse. Newer cesspools are [[Precast concrete|cast concrete]] which dramatically decrease any risk of collapse. All new construction in areas without waste sewer systems use these new precast cesspools. In addition, cast concrete cesspools are used commonly in commercial construction for storm water collection.

'''Chemotrophs''' are organisms that obtain [[energy]] by the [[oxidation]] of [[electron donor]]s in their environments.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160912"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Visions of Life on Mars in Earth’s Depths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |date=12 September 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These molecules can be [[organic molecule|organic]] ([[chemoorganotroph]]s) or [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] ([[chemolithotroph]]s).  The chemotroph designation is in contrast to [[phototroph]]s, which utilize solar energy. Chemotrophs can be either [[autotroph]]ic or [[heterotroph]]ic. Chemotrophs are commonly found in ocean floors where sunlight cannot reach them because they are not dependent on solar energy. Ocean floors often contain underwater volcanos that can provide heat as a substitute for sunlight's warmth.

==Chemoautotroph== 
'''Chemoautotrophs''' (or chemotrophic autotroph) (''[[Ancient Greek language|Greek]]'': Chemo (χημία) = chemical, auto (αὐτός) = self, troph (τροφιά) = nourishment), in addition to deriving energy from [[chemical reaction]]s, synthesize all necessary organic compounds from [[carbon dioxide]]. Chemoautotrophs use inorganic energy sources such as [[hydrogen sulfide]], elemental [[sulfur]], [[iron(II) oxide|ferrous iron]], molecular [[hydrogen]], and [[ammonia]].  Most chemoautotrophs are [[extremophile]]s, [[bacteria]] or [[archaea]] that live in hostile environments (such as [[deep sea vent]]s) and are the [[primary producer]]s in such [[ecosystem]]s. Chemoautotrophs generally fall into several groups: [[methanogen]]s, [[halophile]]s, [[Microbial metabolism#Sulfur oxidation|sulfur oxidizers]] and [[Sulfur-reducing bacteria|reducer]]s, [[nitrification|nitrifiers]], [[anammox]] bacteria, and [[thermoacidophile]]s. An example of one of these prokaryotes would be [[Sulfolobus]]. Chemolithotrophic growth can be dramatically fast, such as ''[[Hydrogenovibrio crunogenus]]'' with a [[doubling time]] around one hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1128/JB.187.16.5761-5766.2005 | pmid=16077123 | volume=187 | issue=16 | title=The Carbon-Concentrating Mechanism of the Hydrothermal Vent Chemolithoautotroph Thiomicrospira crunogena | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Bacteriology | pages=5761–5766 | last1 = Dobrinski | first1 = K.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[chemosynthesis]]", coined in 1897 by [[Wilhelm Pfeffer]], originally was defined as the energy production by oxidation of inorganic substances in association with [[autotrophy]] - what would be named today as chemolithoautotrophy. Later, the term would include also the chemoorganoautotrophy, that is, it can be seen as a synonym of [[chemoautotrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, D. P., &amp; Wood, A. P. (2006).

In the deep oceans, iron-oxidizing bacteria derive their energy needs by oxidizing ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) to ferric iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;). The electron conserved from this reaction reduces the [[respiratory chain]] and can be thus used in the synthesis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] by forward [[electron transport]] or [[NADH]] by reverse [[electron transport]], replacing or augmenting traditional [[phototrophism]].
*In general, iron-oxidizing bacteria can exist only in areas with high ferrous iron concentrations, such as new lava beds or areas of hydrothermal activity. Most of the ocean is devoid of ferrous iron, due to both the oxidative effect of dissolved oxygen in the water and the tendency of bacteria to take up the iron.
*Lava beds supply bacteria with ferrous iron straight from the Earth's mantle, but only newly formed [[igneous]] rocks have high enough levels of ferrous iron. In addition, because oxygen is necessary for the reaction, these bacteria are much more common in the upper ocean, where oxygen is more abundant.
*What is still unknown is how exactly iron bacteria extract iron from rock. It is accepted that some mechanism exists that eats away at the rock, perhaps through specialized [[enzyme]]s or compounds that bring more FeO to the surface. It has been long debated about how much of the weathering of the rock is due to [[biotic component]]s and how much can be attributed to [[abiotic component]]s.
*Hydrothermal vents also release large quantities of dissolved iron into the deep ocean, allowing bacteria to survive. In addition, the high thermal gradient around vent systems means a wide variety of bacteria can coexist, each with its own specialized temperature niche.
*Regardless of the [[catalytic]] method used, chemoautotrophic bacteria provide a significant but frequently overlooked food source for deep sea ecosystems - which otherwise receive limited sunlight and organic nutrients.

[[Manganese]]-oxidizing bacteria also make use of igneous lava rocks in much the same way; by oxidizing manganous manganese (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) into manganic (Mn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;) manganese. Manganese is more scarce than iron oceanic crust, but is much easier for bacteria to extract from igneous glass. In addition, each manganese oxidation donates two electrons to the cell versus one for each iron oxidation, though the amount of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] or [[NADH]] that can be synthesised in couple to these reactions varies with pH and specific reaction thermodynamics in terms of how much of a [[Gibbs free energy]] change there is during the oxidation reactions versus the energy change required for the formation of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] or [[NADH]], all of which vary with concentration, pH etc. Much still remains unknown about manganese-oxidizing bacteria because they have not been cultured and documented to any great extent.

Common misunderstandings include the following ideas:
# Every aspect of the biology of an [[organism]] can be predicted from its [[gene]]s
# Single genes code for specific [[anatomy|anatomical]] or [[ethology|behavioural]] features
# Genes are a [[blueprint]] of an organism's form and behaviour
# Genes are uninterrupted sections of [[DNA]] that only code for a single [[protein]]

==Genetic determinism==
{{Main|Genetic determinism}}
While there are many examples of animals that display certain well-defined behaviour that is genetically programmed,&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.personalityresearch.org/evolutionary/sphexishness.html see this discussion] of the behaviour of the [[Sphex|digger wasp]]&lt;/ref&gt; these examples have been extrapolated to a popular misconception that all patterns of behaviour, and more generally the [[phenotype]], are rigidly genetically determined. There is good evidence that some basic aspects of human behaviour, such as [[circadian rhythm]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Florez JC, Takahashi JS |title=The circadian clock: from molecules to behaviour |journal=Ann. Med. |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=481–90 |date=August 1995 |pmid=8519510 |doi=10.3109/07853899509002457 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are genetically-based, but it is clear that many other aspects are not.

In the first place, much phenotypic variability does not stem from genes themselves. For example:
# [[Epigenetic inheritance]]. In the widest definition this includes all biological inheritance mechanisms that do not change the DNA sequence of the [[genome]]. In a narrower definition it excludes biological phenomena such as the effects of [[prions]] and maternal antibodies which are also inherited and have clear survival implications.
# [[Learning|Learning from experience]]. This is obviously a very important feature of humans, but there is considerable evidence of learned behaviour in other animal species ([[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s). There are even reports of learned behaviour in ''[[Drosophila]]'' [[larva]]e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gerber B, Hendel T |title=Outcome expectations drive learned behaviour in larval Drosophila |journal=Proc. Biol. Sci. |volume=273 |issue=1604 |pages=2965–8 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17015355 |pmc=1639518 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3673 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17015355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A gene for X==
In the early years of genetics it was suggested that there might be "a gene for" a wide range of particular characteristics. This was partly because the examples studied from [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]] onwards inevitably focused on genes whose effects could be readily identified; partly that it was easier to teach science that way; and partly because the mathematics of evolutionary dynamics is simpler if there is a simple mapping between genes and phenotypic characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document

These have led to the general perception that there is "a gene for" arbitrary traits,&lt;ref name=Bishop2010&gt;{{cite web

leading to controversy in particular cases such as the purported "[[Biology and sexual orientation|gay gene]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | accessdate = 2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in light of the known complexities of gene expression networks (and phenomena such as [[epigenetics]]), it is clear that instances where a single gene "codes for" a single, discernible phenotypic effect are rare, and that media presentations of "a gene for X" grossly oversimplify the vast majority of situations.

==Genes as a blueprint==
It is widely believed that genes provide a "blueprint" for the body in much the same way that [[architecture|architectural]] or [[mechanical engineering]] blueprints describe buildings or machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dusheck J |title=The interpretation of genes |journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |volume=111 |pages=52–9 |year=2002 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_8_111/ai_92284523}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a superficial level, genes and conventional blueprints share the common property of being low [[dimension]]al (genes are organised as a one-dimensional string of [[nucleotide]]s;&lt;ref name=RD/&gt; blueprints are typically two-dimensional drawings on paper) but containing information about fully three-dimensional structures. However, this view ignores the fundamental differences between genes and blueprints in the nature of the mapping from low order information to the high order object.

In the case of biological systems, a long and complicated chain of interactions separates genetic information from [[macroscopic]] structures and functions. The following simplified diagram of causality illustrates this:

:Genes → Gene expression → Proteins → Metabolic pathways → Sub-cellular structures → Cells → Tissues → Organs → Organisms

Even at the small scale, the relationship between genes and proteins (once thought of as "[[one gene, one polypeptide]]")&lt;ref&gt;Evers, C. [http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/One_Gene_One_Enzyme.html The One Gene/One Enzyme Hypothesis], [https://web.archive.org/web/20000303105015/http://www.nationalhealthmuseum.org/ National Health Museum], retrieved 12 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; is more complicated, because of [[alternative splicing]].

Also, the causal chains from genes to functionality are not separate or isolated but are entangled together, most obviously in [[metabolic pathway]]s (such as the [[Calvin cycle|Calvin]] and [[citric acid cycle|citric acid]] cycles) which link a succession of [[enzyme]]s (and, thus, gene products) to form a coherent [[biochemistry|biochemical]] system. Furthermore, information flow in the chain is not exclusively one-way. While the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] describes how information cannot be passed back to inheritable genetic information, the other causal arrows in this chain can be [[wikt:bidirectional|bidirectional]], with complex feedbacks ultimately regulating [[gene expression]].

Instead of being a simple, linear mapping, this complex relationship between genotype and phenotype is not straightforward to [[Code|decode]]. Rather than describing genetic information as a blueprint, some have suggested that a more appropriate [[analogy]] is that of a [[recipe]] for [[cooking]],&lt;ref name=RD&gt;{{cite book | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | authorlink = Richard Dawkins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Blind Watchmaker | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc. | location = New York | origyear = 1986 | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-393-31570-3 |page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a collection of [[ingredient]]s is combined via a set of instructions to form an [[emergent property|emergent structure]], such as a cake, that is not described explicitly in the recipe itself.

==Genes as words==

This diagram labels a region of only 40 or so bases as a gene. In reality most genes are hundreds of times larger and have several Introns, sometimes over 100.]]

It is popularly supposed that a gene is "a linear sequence of nucleotides along a segment of DNA that provides the coded instructions for synthesis of RNA"&lt;ref&gt;gene. (n.d.). Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Retrieved 30 May 2007, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gene Dictionary.com website]&lt;/ref&gt; and even some current medical dictionaries define a gene as "a hereditary unit that occupies a specific location on a chromosome, determines a particular characteristic in an organism by directing the formation of a specific protein, and is capable of replicating itself at each cell division."&lt;ref&gt;gene. (n.d.). The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved 30 May 2007, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gene Dictionary.com website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, as the diagram illustrates schematically, genes are much more complicated and elusive concepts. A reasonable modern definition of a gene is "a locatable region of genomic sequence, corresponding to a unit of inheritance, which is associated with regulatory regions, transcribed regions and/or other functional sequence regions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pearson H |title=Genetics: What is a gene? |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue= 7092|pages=398–401 |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/441398a |pmid=16724031|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..398P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of misperception is perpetuated when mainstream media report that an organism's genome has been "deciphered" when they mean that it has simply been [[Sequencing|sequenced]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[The New York Times]]'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/01/science/01gene.html?ex=1338350400&amp;en=b0aff834ad39b962&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss Genome of DNA Discoverer Is Deciphered].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10862">'''Consulting psychology''' is a specialty area of [[psychology]] that addresses such areas as [[psychological evaluation|assessment]] and interventions at the individual, group, and organizational levels. The ''Handbook of Organizational Consulting Psychology''&lt;ref&gt;Lowman, R.L. (Ed.). (2002). ''Handbook of Organizational Consulting Psychology''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; provides an overview of specific areas of study and application within the field. The major journal in the field is ''[[Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research]]''. Consulting psychologists typically work in business or non-profit organizations, in consulting firms or in private practice. Consulting psychologists are typically professionally licensed as psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apadiv31.org/Coop/EducationInOrganizationalPsychology.pdf |title=Education and Training in Organizational and Consulting Psychology |last=Lowman |first=Rodney L. |work=PDF |accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining consulting psychology==
The [[American Psychological Association]] defines the fields as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Consulting psychology shall be defined as the function of applying and extending the specialized knowledge of a psychologist through the process of consultation to problems involving human behavior in various areas. A consulting psychologist shall be defined as a psychologist who provides specialized technical assistance to individuals or organizations in regard to the psychological aspects of their work. Such assistance is advisory in nature and the consultant has no direct responsibility for its acceptance. Consulting psychologists may have as clients individuals, institutions, agencies, corporations or other kinds of organization."&lt;ref&gt;APA Division 13, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Consultation should help individuals and organizations "become more efficient and effective."&lt;ref&gt;Former Div. 13 Chair DeWayne Kurpius, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models of consultation==

===Generic===

The generic model encompasses all kinds of consulting, starting with Entry, moving through Diagnosis and Implementation and ending with an explicit Disengagement.&lt;ref name="cg"&gt;Caplan, G. (1970). ''Theory and practice of mental health consultation''. New York: Basic Books.; Caplan, G. &amp; Caplan, R.B. (1993). Mental health consultation and collaboration. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Client-centered===

This approach focuses on an individual client (recipient of service) and helps service providers better help that client.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; The consultant functions assesses the client, makes a diagnosis and recommends changes to the consultee, typically a teacher, physician or other care providers.

===Consultee-centered===

This relationship focuses on the consultee rather than a particular client, helping build new skills via training and/or supervision.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; The consultant typically does not meet clients directly. Consultees seek consultation to increase knowledge, skills, confidence, and/or objectivity.

===Consultee-centered administrative consultation===

In some cases, the focus is on administrative rather than professional staff. Such relationships are typically longer term.

=== Behavioral consultation model/behavioral-operant ===
In this model, the consultant is an authority figure who assumes primary responsibility for the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Bergan, J.R. &amp; Kratochwill, T.R. (1990) ''Behavioral Consultation and Therapy''. New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is on problem-solving more than skills development or a particular client.

===Organization consultation===
This model employs systems theory to improve productivity or to streamline the relationship between an organization and its environment.

===Statistical consultation===
A model that focuses on having statistical consultants to research empirical evidence and sophisticated analysis through consulting test and certified projects.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, J. &amp; Dang, J.(2010) ''Measurement, Monte Carlo, and music: Why doctorates in psychology and other applied fields make desirable consultants in statistics''. Consulting Psychology Journal, 62,4–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation and risk management===
A model used by behavioral scientists who works in jury thought and decision making processes. They are usually reserved to help attorneys and insurance companies to evaluate the risks of lawsuits and/or the application of settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, J. M. (2010) ''Litigation consulting: Expanding beyond jury selection to trial strategy and tactics''. Consulting Psychology Journal, 62,
12–20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles==
Consulting psychology encompasses diverse roles including individual assessment, individual and group process consultation, organizational development, education/training, employee selection/appraisal, research and evaluation test construction, executive/manager coaching, change management, expert technical support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.div13.org/about_consulting.aspx |title=Society of Consulting Psychology (Division 13) |publisher=Div13.org |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional education==
The [[American Psychological Association]] publishes professional training guidelines for consulting psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Guidelines for education and training at the doctoral and postdoctoral levels in consulting psychology/Organizational consulting psychology (2007). ''American Psychologist'', 62, 980–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Master's programs are available under varying program names (e.g., business psychology). Some psychologists come to the field from areas such as [[clinical psychology]], [[counseling psychology]], or [[industrial and organizational psychology]].

==Consultation in community psychology==
It is often critical to build community relationships to understand the context and enable the collection of appropriate data to supporting the consulting relationship. Strong relationships can increase trust between consultants and clients, leading to more effective interventions. [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]]'s model of [[Ecological Systems Theory]] is a framework for navigating the challenges of consulting in community psychology.

===Cultural sensitivity===

{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
Consulting psychology can involve providers in communities unlike their own. Success requires sensitivity to cultural variation, including recognition of the consultant's own cultural bias and/or ethnocentrism. This is further complicated by potential differences between the background of the consultee and client. In this context, "culture" involves client’s/consultee’s religious, cultural and family background and value system.

Cultural differences can involve communication styles, attitudes towards conflict, approaches to completing tasks, decision-making and attitudes towards disclosure.

==Notable consulting psychologists==
Consulting psychologists who have helped to develop the field include [[Clayton Alderfer]], Chris Argyris, [[Eliott Jaques]], Harry Levinson, and [[Edgar Schein]]. More recent authors include Arthur Freedman, Dale Fuqua, Richard Kilburg, [[Rodney L. Lowman]], Jody Newman, Ann O'Roark, David Peterson, Sharon Robinson-Kurpius, Peter Sorensen, and Len Sperry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Society of Consulting Psychology==
The field's professional association is the [[Society of Consulting Psychology]], Division 13 of the [[American Psychological Association]]. The [[Society of Industrial–Organizational Psychology]] is another professional association of which many consulting psychologists are members.

The [[American Board of Professional Psychology]] certifies participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abpp.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3314 |title=ABAP – Organizational and Business Consulting Psychology |publisher=abpp.org |accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical issues==
Consultants face different ethical questions than clinicians:&lt;ref&gt;Fanibanda, D.K. (1976). Ethical issues of mental health consultation. ''Professional Psychology'', 7, 547–52.&lt;/ref&gt;
* What degree of responsibility does the consultant take for a consultee's behavior and client outcomes?
* To what extent and over what period is the consultee dependent on the consultant?
* How is the consultant's responsibility for resolving conflicts with and among other participants?
* What are acceptable motivations for the consultant to offer consulting services?
* How are financial arrangements handled?
* What is the proper oversight for consulting relationships?
* What are the consultant's responsibilities for maintaining confidentiality?

Consulting relationships differ from traditional counseling and psychotherapeutic relationships in fundamental ways{{vague|date=July 2012}} that require consideration in evaluating ethical questions. As of 2012, formal ethical guidelines specific to the discipline are not available. Existing codes of ethics for the helping professions provide limited guidance for consultation practice.&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;Newman, J.L. (1993). Ethical Issues in Consultation. ''Journal of Couunseling and Development'', 72, 148–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical issues are inevitably complicated by the fact that consulting relationships involve three parties: the consultant, the consultee, and the consultee's client system.

Confidentiality depends on the consultant and on the cooperative efforts of perhaps many organizational members. Variable levels of participation means attention to providing only appropriate access to information. Managing information access and confidentiality require negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, J.L. &amp; Robinson, S.E. (1991). In the best interests of the consultee: Ethical issues in consultation. ''Consulting Psychology Bulletin'', 43, 23–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clients' right to informed consent must be maintained in the presence of a consulting relationship. This right is complicated by the corresponding rights of consultees, including the right not to accept consultation.

Power is typically distributed unequally among participants in the consultation process. Power differentials may be real or perceived. Those with greater power must take responsibility for its use and impact.&lt;ref name="newman"/&gt;

Consultants with preexisting personal or professional relationships with participants in the consultation must take care that such relationships do not comprise the process.

'''DNA ligase''' is a specific type of enzyme, a [[ligase]], ({{EC number|6.5.1.1}}) that facilitates the joining of [[DNA]] strands together by catalyzing the formation of a [[phosphodiester bond]]. It plays a role in repairing single-strand breaks in duplex [[DNA]] in living organisms, but some forms (such as [[LIG4|DNA ligase IV]]) may specifically repair double-strand breaks (i.e. a break in both [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] strands of DNA). Single-strand breaks are repaired by DNA ligase using the complementary strand of the double helix as a template,&lt;ref name="pmid15565146"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pascal JM, O'Brien PJ, Tomkinson AE, Ellenberger T | title = Human DNA ligase I completely encircles and partially unwinds nicked DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 432 | issue = 7016 | pages = 473–8 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15565146 | doi = 10.1038/nature03082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with DNA ligase creating the final phosphodiester bond to fully repair the DNA.

DNA ligase is used in both [[DNA repair]] and [[DNA replication]] (see ''[[DNA ligase#Mammalian ligases|Mammalian ligases]]'').  In addition, DNA ligase has extensive use in [[molecular biology]] laboratories for [[recombinant DNA]] experiments (see ''[[DNA ligase#Research Applications|Research Applications]]''). Purified DNA ligase is used in gene cloning to join DNA molecules together to form [[recombinant DNA]].

== Enzymatic mechanism ==
[[File:Ligase.svg|thumb|The image demonstrates how ligase (yellow oval) catalyzes two DNA fragment strands. The ligase joins the two fragments of DNA to form a longer strand of DNA by "pasting" them together.]]
The mechanism of DNA ligase is to form two [[covalent]] [[phosphodiester bonds]] between [[3' end|3' hydroxyl ends]] of one [[nucleotide]] ("acceptor"), with the [[5' end|5' phosphate end]] of another ("donor"). Two ATP molecules are consumed for each phosphodiester bond formed. AMP is required for the ligase reaction, which proceeds in four steps:

# Reorganization of activity site such as nicks in DNA segments or Okazaki fragments etc.
# Adenylation (addition of AMP) of a [[lysine]] residue in the active center of the enzyme, [[pyrophosphate]] is released;
# Transfer of the AMP to the 5' phosphate of the so-called donor, formation of a pyrophosphate bond; 
# Formation of a phosphodiester bond between the 5' phosphate of the donor and the 3' hydroxyl of the acceptor.&lt;ref name="pmid4377758"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lehman IR | title = DNA ligase: structure, mechanism, and function | journal = Science | volume = 186 | issue = 4166 | pages = 790–7 | date = November 1974 | pmid = 4377758 | doi = 10.1126/science.186.4166.790 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ligation.svg|thumb|center|350px|A pictorial example of how a ligase works (with [[DNA end|sticky end]]s)]]

Ligase will also work with [[DNA end|blunt end]]s, although higher enzyme concentrations and different reaction conditions are required.

== Types ==

=== ''E. coli'' ===
The ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' DNA ligase is encoded by the ''lig'' gene.  DNA ligase in ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', as well as most prokaryotes, uses energy gained by cleaving [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD) to create the phosphodiester bond.&lt;ref name="foster"/&gt;  It does not ligate blunt-ended DNA except under conditions of molecular crowding with [[polyethylene glycol]], and cannot join RNA to DNA efficiently.

The activity of E. coli DNA ligase can be enhanced by [[DNA polymerase]] at the right concentrations. Enhancement only works when the concentrations of the DNA polymerase 1 are much lower than the DNA fragments to be ligated. When the concentrations of Pol I DNA polymerases are higher, it has an adverse effect on E. coli DNA ligase&lt;ref name="pmid29409896"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang Y, LiCata VJ | title = Pol I DNA polymerases stimulate DNA end-joining by Escherichia coli DNA ligase | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 497 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–18 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29409896 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.01.165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== T4 ===
The DNA ligase from [[bacteriophage T4]]('''Enterobacteria phage T4''' is a [[bacteriophage]] that infects ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' bacteria. The T4 phage is a member of the [[T-even bacteriophages|T-even phages]], a group including enterobacteriophages [[Enterobacteria phage T2|T2]] and [[Enterobacteria phage T6|T6]]. T4 is capable of undergoing only a [[Lytic|lytic lifecycle]] and not the [[Lysogeny|lysogenic lifecycle]].) is the ligase most-commonly used in laboratory research.&lt;ref name="url_www.promega.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.promega.com/~/media/files/resources/product%20guides/cloning%20enzymes/ligases.pdf?la=en+ | title = Ligases | work = Enzyme Resources Guide | publisher = Promega Corporation | pages = 8–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can ligate either [[cohesive end|cohesive or  blunt ends]] of DNA, oligonucleotides, as well as RNA and RNA-DNA hybrids, but not single-stranded nucleic acids. It can also ligate [[Sticky and blunt ends|blunt-ended DNA]] with much greater efficiency than ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' DNA ligase.  Unlike ''E. coli'' DNA ligase, T4 DNA ligase cannot utilize NAD and it has an absolute requirement for ATP as a cofactor. Some engineering has been done to improve the ''in vitro'' activity of T4 DNA ligase; one successful approach, for example, tested T4 DNA ligase fused to several alternative DNA binding proteins and found that the constructs with either p50 or [[NF-kB]] as fusion partners were over 160% more active in blunt-end ligations for cloning purposes than wild type T4 DNA ligase.&lt;ref name="pmid23754529"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson RH, Morton SK, Deiderick H, Gerth ML, Paul HA, Gerber I, Patel A, Ellington AD, Hunicke-Smith SP, Patrick WM | title = Engineered DNA ligases with improved activities in vitro | journal = Protein Engineering, Design &amp; Selection | volume = 26 | issue = 7 | pages = 471–8 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23754529 | doi = 10.1093/protein/gzt024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical reaction for inserting a fragment into a plasmid vector would use about 0.01 (sticky ends) to 1 (blunt ends) units of ligase.  The optimal incubation temperature for T4 DNA ligase is 16 °C.&amp;nbsp;

=== Mammalian ===
In mammals, there are four specific types of ligase.
#[[LIG1|DNA ligase I]]: ligates the nascent DNA of the [[DNA replication#Lagging strand|lagging strand]] after the [[RNase H|Ribonuclease H]] has removed the RNA primer from the [[Okazaki fragment]]s.
#[[LIG3|DNA ligase III]]: [[protein complex|complexes]] with [[DNA repair]] [[protein]] [[XRCC1]] to aid in sealing DNA during the process of [[DNA repair|nucleotide excision repair]] and recombinant fragments. Of the all known mammalian DNA ligases, only Lig III has been found to be present in mitochondria.
#[[LIG4|DNA ligase IV]]: complexes with [[XRCC4]].  It catalyzes the final step in the [[non-homologous end joining]] DNA double-strand break repair pathway.  It is also required for [[V(D)J recombination]], the process that generates diversity in [[immunoglobulin]] and [[T-cell receptor]] loci during [[immune system]] development.

*DNA ligase II: appears to be used in repair. It is formed by alternative splicing of a proteolytic fragment of DNA ligase III and does not have its own gene, therefore it is often considered to be virtually identical to DNA ligase III.

DNA ligase from [[eukaryotes]] and some microbes uses [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) rather than NAD.&lt;ref name="foster"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Foster JB, Slonczewski J | title = Microbiology: An Evolving Science | edition = Second | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company | location = New York | year = 2010 | pages = | isbn = 978-0-393-93447-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermostable===
Derived from a thermophilic bacterium, the enzyme is stable and active at much higher temperatures than conventional DNA ligases. Its half-life is 48 hours at 65°C and greater than 1&amp;nbsp;hour at 95°C. Ampligase DNA Ligase has been shown to be active for at least 500 thermal cycles (94°C/80°C) or 16 hours of cycling.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;This exceptional thermostability permits extremely high hybridization stringency and ligation specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epibio.com/enzymes/ligases-kinases-phosphatases/dna-ligases/ampligase-thermostable-dna-ligase?details|title=Ampligase- Thermostable DNA Ligase|website=www.epibio.com|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement of activity==
There are at least three different units used to measure the activity of DNA ligase:&lt;ref name="Russell_2001"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Russell DW, Sambrook J | title = Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory | location = Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-87969-577-4 | volume = 1 | edition = 3rd | chapter = Chapter 1: Plasmids and Their Usefulness in Molecular Cloning  | pages=1–159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Weiss unit''' - the amount of ligase that catalyzes the exchange of 1 nmole of &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P from inorganic [[pyrophosphate]] to ATP in 20 minutes at 37&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt;C.  This is the one most commonly used.
* '''Modrich-Lehman unit''' - this is rarely used, and one unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to convert 100 nmoles of d(A-T)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to an exonuclease-III resistant form in 30 minutes under standard conditions.
* Many commercial suppliers of ligases use an arbitrary unit based on the ability of ligase to ligate cohesive ends.  These units are often more subjective than quantitative and lack precision.

== Research applications ==
{{main|Ligation (molecular biology) }}
DNA ligases have become indispensable tools in modern molecular biology research for generating [[recombinant DNA]] sequences.  For example, DNA ligases are used with [[restriction enzyme]]s to insert DNA fragments, often [[genes]], into [[plasmid]]s.

Controlling the optimal temperature is a vital aspect of performing efficient recombination experiments involving the ligation of cohesive-ended fragments.  Most experiments use T4 DNA Ligase (isolated from [[Enterobacteria phage T4|bacteriophage T4]]), which is most active at 37&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Baneyx_1993"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Baneyx F, Lucotte G | title = Introduction to Molecular Cloning Techniques | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester | year = 1993 | page = 156 | isbn = 978-0-471-18849-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, for optimal ligation efficiency with cohesive-ended fragments ("sticky ends"), the optimal enzyme temperature needs to be balanced with the [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of the sticky ends being ligated,&lt;ref name="Tabor_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabor S | title = DNA ligases | journal = Current Protocols in Molecular Biology | volume = Chapter 3 | issue =  | pages = Unit 3.14 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 18265223 | doi = 10.1002/0471142727.mb0314s08 | isbn = 978-0-471-14272-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Homologous chromosome|homologous pairing]] of the sticky ends will not be stable because the high temperature disrupts [[hydrogen bonding]]. A ligation reaction is most efficient when the sticky ends are already stably annealed, and disruption of the annealing ends would therefore result in low ligation efficiency. The shorter the [[DNA end#Overhangs and sticky ends|overhang]], the lower the T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;. It has been shown recently that T4 DNA ligase in combination with 3 M [[Trimethylglycine|betaine]] and 10 % [[Polyethylene glycol|PEG]] 8000 can ligate [[Xeno nucleic acid|XNA]] molecules &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kestemont|first=Donaat|last2=Renders|first2=Marleen|last3=Leonczak|first3=Piotr|last4=Abramov|first4=Mikhail|last5=Schepers|first5=Guy|last6=Pinheiro|first6=Vitor B.|last7=Rozenski|first7=Jef|last8=Herdewijn|first8=Piet|date=2018|title=XNA ligation using T4 DNA ligase in crowding conditions|url=https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2018/CC/C8CC02414F|journal=Chemical Communications|language=en|volume=54|issue=49|pages=6408–6411|doi=10.1039/c8cc02414f|issn=1359-7345}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Since blunt-ended DNA fragments have no cohesive ends to anneal, the melting temperature is not a factor to consider within the normal temperature range of the ligation reaction. The limiting factor in blunt end ligation is not the activity of the ligase but rather the number of alignments between DNA fragment ends that occur.  The most efficient ligation temperature for blunt-ended DNA would therefore be the temperature at which the greatest number of alignments can occur.  The majority of blunt-ended ligations are carried out at 14-25&amp;nbsp;°C overnight.  The absence of stably annealed ends also means that the ligation efficiency is lowered, requiring a higher ligase concentration to be used.&lt;ref name="Tabor_2001"/&gt;

A novel use of DNA ligase can be seen in the field of nano chemistry, specifically in DNA origami. &amp;nbsp;DNA based self-assembly principles have proven useful for organizing nanoscale objects, such as biomolecules, nanomachines, nanoelectronic and photonic component. Assembly of such nano structure requires the creation of an intricate mesh of DNA molecules. Although DNA self-assembly is possible without any outside help using different substrates such as provision of catatonic surface of Aluminium foil, DNA ligase can provide the enzymatic assistance that is required to make DNA lattice structure from DNA over hangs.&lt;ref name="pmid28189681"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhanjadeo MM, Nayak AK, Subudhi U | title = Surface-assisted DNA self-assembly: An enzyme-free strategy towards formation of branched DNA lattice | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 485 | issue = 2 | pages = 492–498 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28189681 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.02.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first DNA ligase was purified and characterized in 1967 by the Gellert, Lehman, Richardson, and Hurwitz laboratories.&lt;ref name="Shuman 17365–17369"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shuman S | title = DNA ligases: progress and prospects | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 284 | issue = 26 | pages = 17365–9 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19329793 | pmc = 2719376 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.R900017200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first purified and characterized by Weiss and Richardson using a six-step chromatographic-fractionation process beginning with elimination of cell debris and addition of streptomycin, followed by several Diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose column washes and a final phosphocellulose fractionation. The final extract contained 10% of the activity initially recorded in the&amp;nbsp;''E. coli&amp;nbsp;''media; along the process it was discovered that ATP and Mg++ were necessary to optimize the reaction. The common commercially available DNA ligases were originally discovered in [[Enterobacteria phage T4|bacteriophage T4]], ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' and other [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="WeissRichardson1967"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss B, Richardson CC | title = Enzymatic breakage and joining of deoxyribonucleic acid, I. Repair of single-strand breaks in DNA by an enzyme system from Escherichia coli infected with T4 bacteriophage | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 1021–8 | date = April 1967 | pmid = 5340583 | pmc = 224649 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.57.4.1021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disorders ==
Genetic deficiencies in human DNA ligases have been associated with clinical syndromes marked by immunodeficiency, radiation sensitivity, and developmental abnormalities,&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="Shuman 17365–17369"/&gt; [[LIG4 syndrome]] (Ligase IV syndrome) is a rare disease associated with mutations in DNA ligase 4 and interferes with dsDNA break-repair mechanisms. Ligase IV syndrome causes immunodeficiency in individuals and is commonly associated with microcephaly and marrow hypoplasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Altmann T, Gennery AR | title = DNA ligase IV syndrome; a review | journal = Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 137 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27717373 | pmc = 5055698 | doi = 10.1186/s13023-016-0520-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of prevalent diseases caused by lack of or malfunctioning of DNA ligase is as follows.

=== Xeroderma pigmentosum ===

Xeroderma pigmentosum, which is commonly known as XP, is an inherited condition characterized by an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight. This condition mostly affects the eyes and areas of skin exposed to the sun. Some affected individuals also have problems involving the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/xeroderma-pigmentosum|title=xeroderma pigmentosum| work = Genetics Home Reference | access-date = 2017-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ataxia-telangiectasia ===

Mutations in the&amp;nbsp;ATM&amp;nbsp;gene cause&amp;nbsp;ataxia-telangiectasia. The&amp;nbsp;ATM&amp;nbsp;gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control&amp;nbsp;cell&amp;nbsp;division&amp;nbsp;and is involved in DNA repair. This protein plays an important role in the normal development and activity of several body systems, including the nervous system and immune system. The ATM protein assists cells in recognizing damaged or broken DNA strands and coordinates DNA repair by activating enzymes that fix the broken strands. Efficient repair of damaged DNA strands helps maintain the stability of the cell's genetic information. Affected children typically develop difficulty walking, problems with balance and hand coordination, involuntary jerking movements (chorea), muscle twitches (myoclonus), and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). The movement problems typically cause people to require wheelchair assistance by adolescence. People with this disorder also have slurred speech and trouble moving their eyes to look side-to-side (oculomotor apraxia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ataxia-telangiectasia#genes | title = ataxia-telangiectasia | work = Genetics Home Reference | access-date = 2017-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fanconi Anemia ===

[[Fanconi anemia]] (FA) is a rare, inherited blood disorder that leads to bone marrow failure. FA prevents bone marrow from making enough new blood cells for the body to work normally. FA also can cause the bone marrow to make many faulty blood cells. This can lead to serious health problems, such as [[leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/fanconi | title = What Is Fanconi Anemia? | publisher = NHLBI, NIH | access-date = 2017-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bloom syndrome ===

[[Bloom syndrome]] results in skin that is sensitive to sun exposure, and usually the development of a butterfly-shaped patch of reddened skin across the nose and cheeks. A skin rash can also appear on other areas that are typically exposed to the sun, such as the back of the hands and the forearms. Small clusters of enlarged blood vessels (telangiectases) often appear in the rash; telangiectases can also occur in the eyes. Other skin features include patches of skin that are lighter or darker than the surrounding areas (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation respectively). These patches appear on areas of the skin that are not exposed to the sun, and their development is not related to the rashes.

== As a drug target ==
In recent studies, human DNA ligase I was used in [[Computer-aided drug design]] to identify DNA ligase inhibitors as possible therapeutic agents to treat cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomkinson AE, Howes TR, Wiest NE | title = DNA ligases as therapeutic targets | journal = Translational Cancer Research | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 24224145 | pmc = 3819426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since excessive cell growth is a hallmark of cancer development, targetes chemotherapy that disrupts the functioning of DNA ligase can impede adjuvant cancer forms. Furthermore, it has been shown that DNA ligase can be broadly divided into two categories namely, ATP dependent and NAD+ dependent. Previous research has shown that although NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent DNA ligases have been discovered in sporadic cellular or viral niches outside the bacterial domain of life, there is no instance in which a NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent ligase is present in a eukaryal organism. The narrow phylogenetic distribution, unique substrate specificity, and distinctive domain structure of NAD+ depandant compared with ATP-dependent human DNA ligases recommend the NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;ligases as targets for the development of new antibacterial drugs.&lt;ref name="Shuman 17365–17369" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1592">A '''device-independent pixel''' (also: ''density-independent pixel'', ''dip'', ''dp'') is a physical [[Units of measurement|unit of measurement]] based on a coordinate system held by a computer and represents an abstraction of a [[pixel]] for use by an application that an underlying system then converts to physical pixels.

A typical use is to allow mobile device software to scale the display of information and user interaction to different screen sizes. The abstraction allows an application to work in pixels as a measurement, while the underlying graphics system converts the abstract pixel measurements of the application into real pixel measurements appropriate to the particular device.
For example, on the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system a device-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 [[Dots per inch|dpi]] screen,&lt;ref&gt;http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#dips-pels&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] specifies one device-independent pixel as equivalent to 1/96th of an inch.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/text/archive/2009/12/11/wpf-text-measurement-units.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

As dp is a physical unit it has an absolute value which can be measured in traditional units, e.g. for Android devices 1 dp equals 1/160 of inch or 0.15875 mm.

While traditional pixels only refer to the display of information, device-independent pixels may also be used to measure user input such as input on a touch screen device.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2085">A '''drop-out compensator''' is an [[error concealment]] device that was commonly used in the [[analog video]] era to hide brief RF signal "drop-outs" on [[videotape]] playback caused by imperfections in or damage to the tape's magnetic coating. Most compensators worked by repeating earlier video scan-lines over short periods of signal loss; one early such system, "Mincom" was developed in the 1960s by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the company now known as [[3M]]. Because of the high cost of the 3M device at the time, [[BBC R&amp;D]] engineers developed a simpler, less expensive unit based on a [[sample-and-hold]] technique for in-house use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/rdreport_1964_77.shtml|title=R&amp;D Report 1964-77 : Simple drop-out compensator for video tape recorders|author=W.K.E. Geddes|date=14 December 1964|accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dedicated drop-out compensators were eventually superseded by the incorporation of drop-out compensation functionality into [[timebase corrector]]s based on analog-to-digital conversion and digital line stores. 

The advent of [[compressed digital video]] systems finally eliminated the need for line-based drop-out compensators. Most low-level media errors, such as those caused by tape damage or imperfections, are now dealt with by [[forward error correction]] techniques, and those which overwhelm the FEC layer are typically too severe to remedy using simple line-based error concealment techniques, because damage to the compressed bitstream will often damage large parts of the video image. However, since occasional signal drop-outs can still occur, either through severe tape damage or because of [[packet loss]] in packetized video transmission, modern [[error concealment]] techniques that are aware of the structure of the compressed video format have been developed to deal with these.

[[File:Eleonora Eduard1.jpg| thumb|[[Eleanor of Castile]], Queen Consort of England 1272–90.]]
The '''Eleanor crosses''' were a series of twelve lavishly decorated stone monuments  topped with tall crosses, of which three survive nearly intact, in a line down part of the east of England. [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] had the crosses erected between 1291 and 1294 in memory of his wife [[Eleanor of Castile]], marking the nightly resting-places along the route taken when her body was transported to London. Several artists worked on the crosses, as the "Expense Rolls" of the Crown show, with some of the work being divided between the main figures, sent from London, and the framework, made locally. "Alexander of Abingdon" and "William of Ireland", both of whom had worked at Westminster Abbey, were apparently the leading sculptors of figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cockerill|first1=Sara|title=Eleanor of Castile: The Shadow Queen|date=2014|publisher=Amberley|page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===The procession===
[[File:Lincoln 171.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Eleanor's viscera in the Angel Choir at [[Lincoln Cathedral]].]]
{{Main|Eleanor of Castile}}
Upon her death in 1290 at [[Harby, Nottinghamshire|Harby]], near the city of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], the body of Queen Eleanor was carried to Lincoln where she was embalmed, probably either at the [[Gilbertine]] [[St. Catherines, Lincoln#St. Catherine's|priory of St Catherine, Lincoln]] in the south of Lincoln, or at the priory of the Dominicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powrie|first1=Jean|title=Eleanor of Castile|date=1990|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[Organ (anatomy)|viscera]], less her heart, were sent to the Angel Choir of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] for burial, where they still rest.  Her body was then sent to London, taking 12 days to reach [[Westminster Abbey]].  The crosses were erected at the places where her funeral procession stopped overnight.

At Westminster she was buried at the feet of her father-in-law King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]. Her heart travelled with the body and was buried in the abbey church at the London Dominicans' priory at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], along with that of her young son [[Alphonso, Earl of Chester]].

===Reasons for construction===
A similar event had taken place in France for the body of King [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in 1271, although his [[memorial cross]]es, unlike Eleanor's, were erected in part as a manifesto for [[canonisation]]; Edward had probably seen similar memorial crosses in France and elsewhere in Europe during his travels.  They were at least in part intended as [[cenotaph]]s to provoke [[chantry chapel|prayers for her soul]] from passers-by and pilgrims&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of St Albans''&lt;/ref&gt;

==The twelve places==
The only three crosses still standing are those at Geddington, Hardingstone, just outside Northampton, and Waltham Cross, although remnants of the lost ones can also be seen at other sites.

[[File:Geddington Eleanor cross.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Geddington cross]]
[[File:QueenEleanorCross.JPG|thumb|right|150px|The Northampton Cross]]
[[File:NorthamptonPlaque.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Plaque recording the history of the Northampton Cross]]

===Lincoln===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|53|12|51|N|00|32|47|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The only remaining piece of the [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] Eleanor cross is in the grounds of [[Lincoln Castle]]. The cross originally stood at [[St. Catherines, Lincoln|St Catherine's]], an area at the end of Lincoln's High Street.

===Grantham===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|52|54|37|N|00|38|25|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
No part survives of the [[Grantham]] Cross in [[Lincolnshire]], though the records of the 18th-century antiquary, [[William Stukeley]], suggest that it featured Eleanor's coats of arms.

===Stamford===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|52|39|22|N|00|29|37|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Only a small marble fragment survives of the [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] Cross in [[Lincolnshire]], a carved rose excavated by [[William Stukeley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamfordmercury.co.uk/letters/Overwhelming-evidence-on-site-of.3242452.jp ''Stamford Mercury'' "Overwhelming evidence on site of Eleanor cross"]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the closure of [[Stamford Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lincolnshire.gov.uk/stamfordmuseum Stamford Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; the carved fragment is displayed in the Discover Stamford area at the town's library. Stukeley's sketch of the top portion of the Stamford Cross, which suggests that it stylistically resembled the Geddington Cross, is preserved in his diaries in the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford. &lt;br/&gt;See below for the modern monument erected by the [[Smith of Derby Group]].

===Geddington===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|52|26|15|N|00|41|07|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Still standing, the [[Geddington]] Cross in [[Northamptonshire]] is the best-preserved of the three survivors. It is unique among the surviving crosses in having a triangular plan, and a taller and more slender profile with a lower tier entirely covered with rosette [[diapering]], instead of the arch-and-gable motif with tracery which appears on both the others; and canopied statues surmounted by a slender hexagonal pinnacle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/ConProperty.57 English Heritage: Geddington's Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardingstone, Northampton===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|52|13|02|N|00|53|50|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The Northampton cross in [[Hardingstone]] in [[Northamptonshire]] is still standing at the edge of [[Delapré Abbey]], on the side of the A508 leading out of Northampton, just north of the junction with the A45; the King stayed nearby at [[Northampton Castle]]. This cross was begun in 1291 by John of Battle. He worked with [[William of Ireland]] to carve the statues: William was paid £3 6s. 8d. per figure.

The cross is octagonal in shape and set upon some steps: the present ones are replacements. It is built in three tiers and originally had a crowning terminal, possibly a cross. It is not known when this became lost.&lt;ref&gt;''The Buildings of England – Northamptonshire''. N [[Pevsner]] (Second edition). {{ISBN|0-300-09632-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local anecdote says that it was knocked off by a low-flying aircraft from a nearby airfield in the Second World War. However the records show that the cross had been lost by 1460 - there is mention of a "headless cross" at the site from where [[Thomas Bourchier (bishop)|Thomas Bourchier]], the Archbishop of Canterbury watched [[Margaret of Anjou]]'s flight following the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/victoriahistoryo03adki#page/2/mode/2up Adkins, W.R.D., ed. ''The Victoria History of the County of Northampton''. -vol iii, p3 (1906)]&lt;/ref&gt; A replacement cross was installed in the first restoration of 1713, but was replaced by the picturesque broken shaft which is seen today by a further restoration in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Salzman|first1=L.F.|title=A History of the County of Northamptonshire Vol 4|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66362|website=British History Online|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cross is referred to in [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain|Tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain]]'', in his report on the Great Fire of Northampton in 1675, "...a townsman being at Queen's Cross upon a hill on the south side of the town, about two miles ({{convert|2|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) off, saw the fire at one end of the town then newly begun, and that before he could get to the town it was burning at the remotest end, opposite where he first saw it."

Its bottom tier features open books.  These probably included painted inscriptions of Eleanor's biography and of prayers for her soul to be said by viewers, now lost.

===Stony Stratford===
&lt;small&gt;(plaque at {{Coord|52|03|32|N|00|51|24|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;

The [[Stony Stratford]] Cross in [[Buckinghamshire]] stood at the lower end of the town, towards the [[River Great Ouse|River Ouse]], on [[Watling Street]] (now the High Street), although its exact location is hotly debated. It is said to have been of a tall elegant design (perhaps similar to that at Geddington); it was destroyed during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] by the Parliamentarians. The base survived for some time, but any trace has vanished. This commemorative plaque on the wall of 157 High Street is all that is now visible, and reads:

"Near this spot stood the Cross erected by King Edward the I to mark the place in Stony Stratford where the body of Queen Eleanor rested on its way from Harby in Nottinghamshire to Westminster Abbey in 1290"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/mkm/stonystratford/docs/eleanor.html Stony Stratford's Eleanor Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woburn===
&lt;small&gt;(approximately at {{Coord|51|59|20|N|00|37|10|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;

Work on the [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]] Cross in [[Bedfordshire]] started in 1292, later than most of the others. A great part of the work was done by one Ralph de Chichester. No part survives. The precise location is unknown.

===Dunstable===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|53|10|N|00|31|16|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;

Eleanor's coffin was guarded by Canons in [[Dunstable Priory]] whilst local people mourned at the crossroads in [[Dunstable]] in [[Bedfordshire]], the location where the original cross was then constructed. A shopping precinct in High Street North now contains a modern cross statue in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;

===St Albans===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|45|04|N|00|20|26|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The [[St Albans]] Cross in [[Hertfordshire]] was erected in the Market Place at a cost of £100. It stood for many years in front of the fifteenth-century [[Clock Tower, St Albans|Clock Tower]] in the High Street (opposite the Waxhouse Gateway entrance to the [[St Albans Cathedral|Abbey]]), and was demolished in the early eighteenth century due to neglect, and replaced by the town pump. A fountain was erected in its stead in 1874, which was subsequently relocated to Victoria Place.

===Waltham (now Waltham Cross)===
[[File:Waltham Cross.JPG|thumb|The Eleanor Cross at Waltham Cross:  Erected  in 1294 and still intact.]]
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|41|09|N|00|01|59|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The [[Waltham Cross]] monument in [[Hertfordshire]] was constructed in co-operation between an architect and a sculptor: Roger of Crundale, who was the senior royal mason, and Master [[Alexander of Abingdon]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/stories/sadrei_eleanorcross.html Image of the cross at Waltham.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is still standing, although it has been restored on several occasions, and the original statues of Eleanor were replaced by replicas during the last major restoration in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowewood.com/tag/eleanor-cross#post-271 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002090538/http://www.lowewood.com/tag/eleanor-cross#post-271 |date=2 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original statues were kept for some years at Cheshunt Public Library; but they were removed, possibly in the 1980s, to the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]. A photograph on the Lowewood Museum website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowewood.com/tag/eleanor-cross#attachment_273 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002090538/http://www.lowewood.com/tag/eleanor-cross#attachment_273 |date=2 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows one of the original statues in front of a staircase at the library.

===Westcheap (now Cheapside)===
&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|30|51|N|00|05|41|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Fragments of the [[Cheapside]] Cross in the [[City of London]] are held by the [[Museum of London]], but although a number of drawings of the cross – and of its destruction – survive, they post-date an extensive restoration, or even rebuilding, under [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], and thus provide no safe indication of how the original looked.  It is likely, however, that it was similar to the Waltham and Hardingstone Crosses, but even more ornate and boasting some marble facings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cockerill|first1=Sara|title=Eleanor of Castile: The Shadow Queen|date=2014|publisher=Amberley|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cheapside Cross was demolished in May 1643 under an ordinance from the Parliamentary Committee for the Demolition of Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry, led by [[Robert Harley (1579-1656)|Sir Robert Harley]]. The cross was the third incarnation of the monument, which had been reconstructed and refurbished several times in the preceding three centuries, in which time it had enjoyed the protection of various monarchs and the Mayor and Corporation of London.

Matters came to a head during the years running up to the [[English Civil War]], when the cross was seen to encompass the doctrinal debates of the period. To puritanical reformers, it was identified with '[[Dagon]]', the ancient god of the Philistines, and was seen as the embodiment of Royal Catholic tradition. At least one riot was fought in its shadow as opponents of the cross descended upon it to pull it down, and supporters rallied to stop them.

After [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had fled London to raise an army at the start of the Civil War, the destruction of the cross was almost the first order of business for Harley's commission. Though less well known than the Charing Cross, the downfall of the Cheapside Cross is one of the most interesting and arguably important examples of [[iconoclasm]] in English history.

Fragments of this cross are displayed in the [[Museum of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander, Binski|title=Age of Chivalry|year=1987|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charing (now Charing Cross)===

&lt;small&gt;({{Coord|51|30|26|N|00|07|39|W|}})&lt;/small&gt;

The cross at [[Charing Cross]] in [[Westminster]], in what was then the [[Royal Mews]], was the most expensive, built of marble in co-operation between an architect, Richard of Crundale, who was the senior royal mason, and a sculptor, Master [[Alexander of Abingdon]].

According to [[folk etymology]], the name Charing derives from French ''{{lang|fr|chère reine}}'' (dear queen),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Eleanor Crosses|url=http://archive.museumoflondon.org.uk/medieval/People/147014/|work=Eleanor of Castille|publisher=[[Museum of London]]|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the name probably came from the Anglo-Saxon word ''{{lang|ang|ċerring}}'', meaning a bend, as it stands on the outside of a 90-degree bend in the River Thames (see [[Charing]] in Kent). The original cross stood at the top of [[Whitehall]] on the south side of [[Trafalgar Square]], but was destroyed on the orders of Parliament in 1647 during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], and was replaced by an equestrian statue of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1675 following the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]]. This point in Trafalgar Square is regarded as the official centre of London in legislation and when measuring distances from London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/08/15/charingcross_feature.shtml Where Is The Centre Of London?] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replicas and imitations==
During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries several replica Eleanor Crosses were erected, including at [[Ilam, Staffordshire|Ilam]] in Staffordshire, [[Walkden]] in Lancashire, and the [[Eleanor Cross, Sledmere]] in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]].

The most substantial of these is in London, outside Charing Cross railway station. Erected in 1865, a few hundred yards to the east of the original site of the Eleanor Cross, on the [[Strand, London|Strand]], it is not a faithful copy, being more ornate than the original. It stands {{convert|70|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and was commissioned by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] Company for their newly opened Charing Cross Hotel. The new cross was designed by the architect of the hotel, [[Edward Middleton Barry|E. M. Barry]], who is best known for his work on [[Covent Garden]]. It was constructed by [[Thomas Earp (sculptor)|Thomas Earp]] of Lambeth from [[Portland stone]], [[Mansfield]] stone (a fine sandstone) and [[Aberdeen granite]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/7219.aspx "Charing Cross"]. Network Rail. Retrieved 22 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was restored to a substantial extent between October 2009 and July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-10911029|title=Renovated Eleanor's Cross in Charing Cross unveiled|date=9 August 2010|work=News London|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Queen Victoria Monument, Birkenhead]] [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]], Merseyside, unveiled in 1905, is in the form of an Eleanor cross. The Ilam cross was built in 1840 by Jesse Watts Russell of [[Ilam Hall]] to commemorate his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thornber.net/staffs/html/ilam.html Ilam photograph]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Glastonbury Market Cross]] resembles an Eleanor cross.

The start of the 21st century was marked in Stamford by erecting a modern monument inspired by the lost Cross. It stands in Sheepmarket, rather than at the original location. The carved detail is based on the fragment in Stamford Museum.

The '''electrical penetration graph''' or '''EPG''' is a system used by biologists to study the interaction of [[insect]]s such as [[aphid]]s, [[thrips]], and [[leafhopper]]s with [[plant]]s. Therefore, it can also be used to study the basis of [[plant virus]] transmission, host plant selection by insects and the way in which insects can find and feed from the [[phloem]] of the plant. It is a simple system consisting of a partial [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] which is only completed when a species such as aphids, which are the most abundantly studied, inserts its [[stylet (anatomy)|stylet]] into the plant in order to ''probe'' the plant as a suitable host for feeding. The completed circuit is displayed visually as a graph with different waveforms indicating either different insect activities such as saliva excretion or the ingestion of cellular contents or indicating which tissue type has been penetrated (i.e. [[phloem]], [[xylem]] or [[Leaf#Mesophyll|mesophyll]]). So far, around ten different graphical waveforms are known, correlating with different insect/plant interaction events.

== The Circuit ==
The circuit connects to the insect via a 20&amp;nbsp;µm [[gold]] or [[platinum]] wire and to the plant via a copper electrode placed in the soil. The circuit also passes through, normally, a one [[gigaohm]] [[resistor]] and a 50x [[amplifier]] before the results are stored digitally and interpreted by a computer to calculate the final graph.

[[File:Turtle entangled in marine debris (ghost net).jpg|thumb|300px|A sea turtle entangled in a ghost net.]]

'''Ghost nets''' are [[fishing net]]s that have been [[marine debris|left or lost in the ocean]] by fishermen. These nets, often nearly invisible in the dim light, can be left tangled on a rocky reef or drifting in the open sea. They can [[Plastic_pollution#Entanglement|entangle]] [[fish]], [[dolphin]]s, [[sea turtle]]s, [[shark]]s, [[dugong]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[seabird]]s, [[crab]]s, and other creatures, including the occasional human diver.&lt;ref&gt;Esteban, Michelle (2002) [http://www.eurocbc.org/page54.html ''Tracking Down Ghost Nets'']&lt;/ref&gt; Acting as designed, the nets restrict movement, causing starvation, laceration and infection, and suffocation in those that need to return to the surface to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6248366.stm |title='Ghost fishing' killing seabirds |accessdate=2008-04-01 |date=28 June 2007 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Marine organisms entangled in a ghost net within the Maldives (Olive Ridley Project).jpg|thumb|300px|Many marine species including [[turtles]], [[sharks]], [[whales]], [[dolphins]], [[dugong]]s become entangled in ghost nets. Most go unnoticed and unrecorded.]]
[[File:Starbuck AKK FishnetFloat.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[glass float]] on the beach. Many of these floats for fish nets wash up on island beaches around the Pacific. The loss of the floats can leave fish nets drifting in the open ocean where they continue to entangle fish, birds, and marine mammals.]]

Some commercial fisherman use [[gillnet]]s. These are suspended in the sea by flotation [[buoy]]s, such as [[glass float]]s, along one edge. In this way they can form a vertical wall hundreds of metres long, where any fish within a certain size range can be caught. Normally these nets are collected by fishermen and the catch removed. 

If this is not done, the net can continue to catch fish until the weight of the catch exceeds the buoyancy of the floats. The net then sinks, and the fish are devoured by bottom-dwelling crustaceans and other fish. Then the floats pull the net up again and the cycle continues. Given the high-quality synthetics that are used today, the destruction can continue for a long time.

The problem is not just nets but '''ghost gear''' in general;&lt;ref name=guard1&gt;Hannah Gould, [https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/sep/10/fishing-industry-vows-to-tackle-wildlife-deaths-from-ghost-gear Hidden problem of 'ghost gear': the abandoned fishing nets clogging up oceans], ''Theguardian.com'', 10 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; old-fashioned [[crab trap]]s, without the required "rot-out panel", also sit on the bottom, where they become self-baiting traps that go on catching crabs year after year. Even balled-up [[fishing line]] can be deadly for a variety of creatures, including birds and marine mammals. Over time the nets become more and more tangled. In general, fish are less likely to be trapped in gear that has been down a long time.&lt;ref&gt;Dunagan, Christopher (2000)[[The Sun (Lowell)|''The Sun'']]. [http://web.kitsapsun.com/news/2000/may/0504pugetsoundwa.html The net effect: trouble] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404001020/http://web.kitsapsun.com/news/2000/may/0504pugetsoundwa.html |date=2009-04-04 }}, 5 April&lt;/ref&gt;

Fishermen sometimes abandon worn-out nets because it is often the easiest way to get rid of them.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;

The French government offered a reward for ghost nets handed in to local coastguards along sections of the Normandy coast between 1980 and 1981. The project was abandoned when people vandalized nets to claim rewards, without retrieving anything at all from the shoreline or ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Andres, Von Brandt (1984) ''Fish catching methods of the world'' {{ISBN|978-0-685-63409-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, the Global Ghost Gear Initiative (GGGI) was created by the [[World Animal Protection]] to give a unique and stronger voice to the cause.

The term ALDFG means "abandoned or lost or discarded fishing gear".

==Environmental impact==
From 2000 to 2012, the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] reported an average of 11 large [[whales]] entangled in ghost nets every year along the US west coast. From 2002 to 2010, 870 nets were recovered in [[Washington (state)]] with over 32,000 marine animals trapped inside. Ghost gear is estimated to account for 10% of all [[marine litter]].&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;

According to the SeaDoc Society, each ghost net kills $20,000 worth of [[Dungeness crab]] over 10 years. The [[Virginia Institute of Marine Science]] calculated that ghost crab pots capture 1.25 million [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]]s each year in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] alone.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;

In May 2016, the [[Australian Fisheries Management Authority]] (AFMA) recovered 10 tonnes of abandoned nets within the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone and [[Torres Strait]] protected zone perimeters. One protected turtle was rescued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afma.gov.au/ghost-net-busters/ Ghost net busters], ''Afma.gov.au'', 3 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
Unlike synthetic fishing nets, [[biodegradable]] fishing nets decompose naturally under water after a certain period of time. Coconut fibre ([[coir]]) fishing nets are commercially made and are hence a practical solution that can be taken by fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2016-02-biodegradable-fishing-nets-marine-animals.html Biodegradable fishing nets: advantages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/economic/futurefibres/fibres/coir/en/ Coir fishing nets]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company Net-works worked out a solution to turn discarded fishing nets into carpet tiles.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Beavis,[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/30/net-works-is-net-gain-for-poor-coastal-community Net-Works is net gain for poor coastal community], ''Theguardian.com'', 30 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the US Fishing for Energy initiative collected 2.8 million pounds of fishing gear, and in partnership with [[Covanta Energy]] turned this into enough electricity to power 182 homes for one year by incineration.&lt;ref name=guard1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NOAA, [https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/prevention/fishing-energy Fishing for Energy]. Accessed July 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

A plan to protect UK seas from ghost fishing was backed by the [http://conservativeeurope.com/news/meps-back-plan-to-end-ghost-fishing European Parliament] Fisheries Committee in 2018. Mr Flack, who led the committee, said: "Abandoned fishing nets are polluting our seas, wasting fishing stocks and indiscriminately killing whales, sea lions or even dolphins. The tragedy of ghost fishing must end.&lt;ref&gt;MEPs back plan to end ‘ghost fishing', [http://conservativeeurope.com/news/meps-back-plan-to-end-ghost-fishing]. 20 June, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7150">'''Gravitational biology''' is the study of the effects [[gravity]] has on [[life|living organisms]]. Throughout the history of the Earth life has [[evolution|evolved]] to survive changing conditions, such as changes in the [[climate]] and [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. However, one constant factor in evolution since life first began on Earth is the [[force]] of gravity. As a consequence, all [[biological process]]es are accustomed to the ever-present force of gravity and even small variations in this force can have significant impact on the health and function and the system of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/print.php?page=human03 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831083511/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/print.php?page=human03 |archivedate=2007-08-31 |df= }} Astrobiology: The Living Universe - Gravitational Biology&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gravity and life on Earth ==
The force of gravity on the surface of the Earth, normally denoted [[Standard gravity|''g'']], has remained constant in both direction and magnitude since the formation of the planet.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} As a result, both [[plant]] and [[animal]] life have evolved to rely upon and cope with it in various ways.

=== Plant use of gravity ===
{{main|Gravitropism}}
Plant [[tropism]]s are directional movements of a plant with respect to a directional stimulus. One such tropism is [[gravitropism]], or the growth or movement of a plant with respect to gravity. Plant roots grow towards the pull of gravity and away from sunlight, and shoots and stems grow against the pull of gravity and towards sunlight.

=== Animal struggles with gravity ===
Gravity has had an effect on the development of animal life since the first [[single-celled organism]].
The size of single biological cells is [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the strength of the gravitational field exerted on the cell. That is, in stronger gravitational fields the size of cells decreases, and in weaker gravitational fields the size of cells increases. Gravity is thus a limiting factor in the growth of individual cells.

Cells which were naturally larger than the size that gravity alone would allow for had to develop means to protect against internal sedimentation. Several of these methods are based upon [[protoplasm]]ic motion, thin and elongated shape of the cell body, increased [[cytoplasm]]ic [[viscosity]], and a reduced range of [[specific gravity]] of cell components relative to the ground-plasma.&lt;ref&gt;"Gravitational Zoology: How Animals Use and Cope with Gravity" Ralf H. Anken, Hinrich Rahmann. 2001. {{cite web |url=http://www.dlr.de/me/Institut/Abteilungen/Strahlenbiologie/pdf/astrobiologie/P4_20.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928041012/http://www.dlr.de/me/Institut/Abteilungen/Strahlenbiologie/pdf/astrobiologie/P4_20.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of gravity on many-celled organisms is considerably more drastic. During the period when animals first evolved to survive on land some method of directed locomotion and thus a form of [[endoskeleton|inner skeleton]] or [[exoskeleton|outer skeleton]] would have been required to cope with the increase in the force of gravity due to the weakened upward force of [[buoyancy]]. Prior to this point, most lifeforms were small and had a worm- or jellyfish-like appearance, and without this evolutionary step would not have been able to maintain their form or move on land.

In larger terrestrial [[vertebrates]] gravitational forces influence [[musculoskeletal system]]s, fluid distribution, and [[hydrodynamics]] of the [[Circulatory system|circulation]].

== Gravity and life elsewhere ==
{{further|Weightlessness#Human health effects|G-force#Human tolerance of g-force}}
Every day the realization of [[space habitat]]ion becomes closer, and even today [[space station]]s exist and are home to long-term, though not yet permanent, residents. Because of this there is a growing scientific interest in how changes in the gravitational field influence different aspects of the [[physiology]] of living organisms, especially [[mammals]] since these results can normally be closely related to the expected effects on humans. All current research in this field can be classified into two groups.&lt;ref&gt;"Models to Study Gravitational Biology of Mammalian Reproduction". Janet Tou, April Ronca, Richard Grindeland, and Charles Wade. ''Biology of Reproduction'' vol. 67. 2002. {{cite web |url=http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/content/abstract/biolreprod.102.007252v1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630072749/http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/content/abstract/biolreprod.102.007252v1 |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first group consists of the experiments that involve gravitational fields of less than one ''g'', termed ''hypogravity'', without [[artificial gravity]], or ''microgravity''. A space station or a spacecraft in a [[spaceflight]] will be in hypogravity. Therefore, understanding of the effects of hypogravity on the human body is necessary for prolonged space travel and colonization.

The second group consist of those involving gravitational fields of more than one ''g'', termed ''hypergravity''. For brief periods during take-off and landing of space craft [[astronauts]] are under the influence of hypergravity. Understanding the effects of hypergravity are also necessary if colonization of planets larger than the Earth is ever to take place.

===Recent experiments===
Recent experiments have proven that alterations in [[metabolism]], [[immune cell]] function, [[cell division]], and cell attachment all occur in the hypogravity of space. For example, after a matter of days in [[Weightlessness#Microgravity|microgravity]] (&lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; ''g''), human immune cells were unable to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into mature cells. One of the large implications of this is that if certain cells cannot differentiate in space, organisms may not be able to reproduce successfully after exposure to zero gravity.

Scientists believe that the stress associated with space flight is responsible for the inability of some cells to differentiate. These stresses can alter metabolic activities and can disturb the chemical processes in living organisms. A specific example would be that of bone cell growth. Microgravity impedes the development of bone cells. Bone cells must attach themselves to something shortly after development and will die if they cannot. Without the downward pull of a gravitational force on these bone cells, they float around randomly and eventually die off. This suggests that the direction of gravity may give the cells clues as to where to attach themselves.

==History==

Hobart and William Smith Colleges, private colleges in Geneva, New York, began on the western frontier as the Geneva Academy.  After some setbacks and disagreement among trustees, the Academy suspended operations in 1817.  By the time Bishop [[John Henry Hobart]], of the [[Episcopal Diocese of New York]], first visited the city of Geneva in 1818, the doors of Geneva Academy had just closed.  Yet, Geneva was a bustling [[Upstate New York]] city on the main land and stage coach route to the West.  Bishop Hobart had a plan to reopen the Academy at a new location, raise a public subscription for the construction of a stone building, and elevate the school to college status.  Roughly following this plan, Geneva Academy reopened as '''Geneva College''' in 1822 with conditional grant funds made available from [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]] in [[New York City]].  Geneva College was renamed Hobart College in 1852 in honor of its founder, Bishop Hobart.

William Smith College was founded in 1908, originally as William Smith College for Women.  Its namesake and founder was a wealthy local nurseryman, benefactor of the arts and sciences, and philanthropist.  The school arose from negotiations between William Smith, who sought to establish a women's college, and Hobart College President Langdon C. Stewardson, who sought to redirect Smith's philanthropy towards Hobart College. Smith, however, was intent on establishing a coordinate, nonsectarian women's college, which, when realized, coincidentally gave Hobart access to new facilities and professors. The two student bodies were educated separately in the early years, even though William Smith College was a department of Hobart College for organizational purposes until 1943. That year, after a gradual relaxation of academic separation, William Smith College was formally recognized as an independent college, co-equal with Hobart. Both colleges were reflected in a new, joint corporate identity.

In April 2018, the president of the institution resigned following anonymous allegations he plagiarized parts of his doctoral dissertation. However, after a review by his degree-granting institution, it was determined his degree should stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/04/24/ex-president-hobart-will-keep-doctorate |title=Ex-President of Hobart Will Keep Doctorate |author=Scott Jaschik |publisher=Inside Higher Ed |publication-date=24 April 2018 |access-date=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pat McGuire, an emeritus professor of economics, was appointed the interim president of the Colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/04/13/hobart-president-resigns-after-plagiarism-allegations |title=Hobart President Resigns After Plagiarism Allegations |author=Rick Seltzer |publisher=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=April 13, 2018 |accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Layout===

[[File:Stjohnschapel7.jpg|thumb|right| St. John's Chapel, designed by [[Richard Upjohn]]]]

Hobart and William Smith Colleges' campus is situated on {{convert|170|acre|km2}} in [[Geneva, New York]], along the shore of [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]], the largest of the [[Finger Lakes]]. The campus is notable for the style of Jacobean architecture represented by many of its buildings, notably Coxe Hall, which houses the President's Office and other administrative departments. In contrast, the earliest buildings and the chapel are Gothic in style.

[[File:Dem1908.jpg|thumb|left| Hobart Quadrangle (1908)]] '''The Quad''', the core of the Hobart campus, was formed by the construction of Medbery, Coxe, and Demarest. Several years later, Arthur Nash, a Hobart professor, designed Williams Hall, which would be constructed in the gap between Medbery and Coxe. The Quad is formed to the east by Trinity and Geneva Hall, the two original College buildings, and to the south by the Science compound, and Napier Hall. [[Geneva Hall and Trinity Hall, Hobart &amp; William Smith College|Geneva Hall (1822) and Trinity Hall (1837)]] were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the schools announced they were going solar by building two solar farms to create enough electricity for about 50 percent of HWS' needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2016/07/03/hobart-william-smith-solar-farms/86597722/|title=Hobart and William Smith Colleges go solar|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hws coxe hall.JPG|250px|thumb|right|The iconic Coxe Hall, fronting the Hobart Quad.  The building, named for Bishop Arthur Cleveland Coxe, is an excellent example of [[Jacobean architecture]].]]

'''The Hill''' (or William Smith Hill) is a prominent feature of the historic William Smith campus. Located at the top of a large sloping hill to the West of Seneca Lake and the Hobart Quad, the Hill houses three historic William Smith dorms, and one built in the 1960s (Comstock, Miller, Blackwell, and Hirshson Houses). At its peak resides William Smith's all female dorms. The Hill was the site originally conceived for William Smith College. Unveiled in 2008 for the William Smith Centennial is a statue of the college's founder and benefactor, William Smith.

A 15 million dollar expansion of the Scandling Campus Center was completed in autumn 2008.  This renovation added over 17,000 additional square feet, including an expanded cafe, a new post office, and more meeting areas. In 2016 the Gearan Center for Performing Arts was completed at a cost of 28 million dollars; the largest project in the history of the colleges. This 65,000 square foot facility brings together music, dance, theater and media and society in a unified academic space.

===Key buildings===

'''Coxe Hall''', serves as the main administrative hub of campus. Constructed in 1901, the building is named after Bishop Arthur Clevland Coxe, a benefactor of the school, and houses the president's office, Bartlett Theater, The Pub, and a classroom wing, which was added in the 1920s. Arthur Cleveland Coxe was closely affiliated with the school. The building was designed by [[Clinton and Russell]] Architects.

'''Gearan Center for the Performing Arts,''' named in honor of President Mark D Gearan and Mary Herlihy Gearan, is a state of the art facility completed in 2016.  It includes a light-filled lobby that links three flexible performance and rehearsal spaces designed specifically for theater, music and dance. Adaptable seating allows for the creation of spaces that can be changed to accommodate multiple types of productions and audience sizes. Also included are faculty offices, practice and recital rooms and a film screening room.

'''Scandling Campus Center''', named after [[William F. Scandling|William F. Scandling '49]], is the central hub of student life. Scandling, renovated and expanded in 2009, houses Saga (the dining hall), the post office, offices of student activities, a cafe, and Vandervort room (a large event space).

'''Gulick Hall''', was built in 1951 as part of the post-war "mini-boom" that also included the construction of the Hobart "mini-quad" dormitories Durfee, Bartlett, and Hale (each named for a 19th-century Hobart College president). Gulick Hall originally housed the campus dining services and, later, the Office of the Registrar.  Completely renovated in 1991, Gulick now houses both the Office of the Registrar and the Psychology department, which was moved from Smith Hall in 1991 prior to its renovation in 1992.

[[File:Mh1955a.jpg|thumb|left| Medbery Hall in 1955]]

'''Stern Hall''', named for the lead donor, Herbert J. Stern '58, was completed in 2004. It houses the departments of economics, political science, anthropology &amp; sociology, environmental studies and Asian languages and cultures.

'''Smith Hall''', built in 1907, originally housed both the Biology and Psychology Departments.  It is now home to the Dean's Offices of both colleges, along with the departmental offices of Writing and Rhetoric and the various modern language departments.  Smith Hall was the first building constructed with funds from William Smith on the William Smith College campus, but it is also the first building that has always been shared by both colleges.

'''Williams Hall''', completed in 1907, housed the first campus gymnasium and, after the construction of Bristol gymnasium, served several other lives as campus post office, book store, IT services and location of the Music Department.

'''Demarest Hall''', connected to St. John's Chapel by St. Mark's Tower, houses the departments of Religious Studies and English and Comparative Literature as well as the Women's Studies Program.  Also home to the Blackwell Room, named in honor of Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell (once used as study area and library, the space is now used for classrooms in the absence of more intentional planning for classroom space),  Demarest was designed by [[Richard Upjohn]]'s son, Richard M. Upjohn. (Upjohn's grandson, [[Hobart Upjohn]] would design several of the College's buildings as well). Demarest served as the College's library until the construction of the Warren Hunting Smith Library in the early 1970s. In the 1960s it was expanded to hold the College's growing number of volumes. Today, it also houses the Fisher Center for the Study of Women and Men, an intellectual center led by such scholar faculty as Dunbar Moodie (Sociology), and Betty Bayer (Women's Studies).

[[File:Dem1919.jpg|thumb|left| Demarest Hall, 1919]]

'''Trinity Hall''' built in 1837, was the second of the colleges' buildings. Trinity Hall was designed by college president Benjamin Hale, who taught architecture. Trinity served as a dormitory and a library, but it was converted into a space for classrooms, labs, and offices later in the 19th century. It presently is home to the Salisbury Center for Career Services.

[[File:Merritt2.jpg|thumb|right| Merrit Hall, Chemistry Dept.]]

'''Merrit Hall''', completed in 1879, was built on the ruins of the old medical college. Merrit was the first science building on campus and housed the chemistry labs. Merrit also housed a clock atop the quad side of the building. On the eve of the Hobart centennial in 1922, students climbed to the top and made the bell strike 100 times. Merrit Hall was also one of the first buildings shared by Hobart and William Smith. Today Merrit Hall houses a lecture hall and faculty offices.
'''St. John's Chapel''', designed by [[Richard Upjohn]] the architect of [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]] in New York City, served as the religious hub of the campus, replacing Polynomous, the original campus chapel. In the 1960s, St. John's was connected to Demarest Hall by St. Marks Tower.

'''Houghton House''', the mansion, known for its Victorian elements, is home to the Art and Architecture departments. The country mansion was built, in the 1880s by [[William J. King]]. It was purchased in 1901 by the wife of Charles Vail (maiden name Helen Houghton), Hobart graduate and professor, as the family's summer home. Mrs. Vail remodeled the Victorian mansion's interior to the present classical decor in 1913.  The family's "town home" is 624 S. Main Street and is now the Sigma Phi fraternity. Helen Vail's heirs donated the house and its grounds to the colleges to be used as a woman's dormitory. After many years as a student dorm, the house became home to the art department after the original art studio was razed to make way for the new Scandling Campus Center. The building is now home to the Davis Art Gallery, with lecture rooms, multiple faculty offices, and architecture studios on the top floor.

'''Katherine D. Elliot Hall''', was constructed in 2006. The "Elliot" houses {{convert|14600|sqft|m2}} contains art classrooms; offices; studios for painting, photography, and printing; and wood and metal shops.

[[File:Wh1909c.jpg|thumb|right| Williams Hall, 1909. Old College Gymnasium.]]

'''Goldstein Family Carriage House''', was built by William J. King in 1882 and was renovated in 2006 to house a digital imaging lab and a photo studio with a darkroom for black-and-white photography.

'''Warren Hunting Smith Library''', in the center of the campus, houses 385,000 volumes, 12,000 periodicals, and more than 8,000 VHS and DVD videos.  In 1997, the library underwent a major renovation, undergoing several improvements, such the addition of multimedia centers, and the addition to its south side of the L. Thomas Melly Academic Center, a spacious, modern location for "round the clock" study.

'''Napier Hall''', attached to the Rosenberg Hall, houses several classrooms and was completed in 1994.

'''Rosenberg Hall''', named for Henry A. Rosenberg (Hobart '52), is an annex of Lansing and Eaton Hall, the original science buildings. Rosenberg houses many labs and offices.

'''Lansing Hall''', built in 1954, is home to Sciences and Mathematics. The building is named for John Ernest Lansing, Professor of Chemistry (1905–1948), who twice served as acting president.

'''Eaton Hall''', is named for [[Elon Howard Eaton]], Professor of Biology (1908–1935). Eaton, one of New York's outstanding ornithologists, was one of the professors brought to campus with William Smith grant funds. He received the Distinguished Faculty Award in 1992. Eaton Hall is a part of the science complex at the south end of the Hobart Quad, which consists of Lansing, Rosenberg, and Napier.

===Dormitories===

====Men's dorms====
[[File:GenevaHall1896.jpg|thumb|right| Geneva Hall, 1896 Class Day]]

'''Geneva Hall''', built in 1822, is the college's first building, and the cornerstone site designated by the School's founder, Bishop [[John Henry Hobart]]. The building is one of the oldest academic building in continuous use, having served as a dormitory, among other uses, since its completion. The building has inscribed into its quoins, and alongside the perimeter of its facade, plaques which list the graduates of classes dating back to the 19th century.

'''The Mini Quad''', consisting of three building, Durfee, Hale, and Bartlett, houses about 150 Hobart students.  Since the 2010 academic year, Hale is home to one floor of William Smith students.

'''Hale Hall''' is named for Benjamin Hale, president of Hobart College from 1836 to 1858.

'''Bartlett Hall''' was named after the Reverend Murray Bartlett, who served as fourteenth president of Hobart College from 1919 to 1936

'''Durfee Hall''' was named after [[William Pitt Durfee]], who from 1884 to 1929 served as Professor of Mathematics and Chair of the Mathematics Department. He was the first dean of a liberal arts college and served as acting president of the Colleges four times.

====Women's dorms====

'''Blackwell House''' was designed and built in 1860 by [[Richard Upjohn]] as a residence for William Douglass, who served as a trustee of Hobart College. The house was purchased in 1908 as the first William Smith dormitory. The house still houses William Smith students and is known for its grand Victorian features from fireplaces, to chandeliers, to large old windows. Though rarely recognized as such, the house is named for Elizabeth Blackwell, an early graduate of what became the Colleges.

[[File:BlackwellHouse.jpg|thumb|left| Historic Blackwell House]]

'''Comstock House''' was designed by [[Richard Upjohn]]'s grandson, Hobart Upjohn, in 1932.  Comstock is a women's dormitory named for Anna Botsford Comstock, friend of William Smith and the first woman to be named a member of the Board of Trustees.

'''Miller House''' was William Smith College's second dormitory. Miller was designed by Arthur Nash, professor and grandson of Arthur Cleveland Coxe. Nash also designed Smith Hall and Williams Hall. This house honors Elizabeth Smith Miller, a leader in the women's movement.

'''Hirshson House''', completed in 1962, was named for the president of the colleges, Dr. Louis Melbourne Hirshson, the last Episcopal clegy person to serve in that capacity. The building is home to William Smith students.

====Coed dorms====

[[File:Mh1955c.jpg|thumb| Medbery Hall, 1955|alt=]]

'''Medbery Hall''' is an original Hobart College dorm dating from the 1900. Medbery defines the right side of the Hobart Quadrangle. Designed by [[Clinton and Russell]] architects at the same time as Coxe Hall, the two buildings share similarity in their Jacobean Gothic style. Medbery is adorned with a recognizable Flemish roofline. Medbery was designed without long hallways "conductive to rioting" and mischief, such as rolling a cannonball down the hallway. Such mischief was experienced in the other two dormitories on campus, Geneva and Trinity Halls.

'''Jackson, Potter, Rees''', together known as JPR for short (and once dubbed "superdorm"), the three identical buildings create their own quad in the south end of campus. The dorms were built in 1966 and are named after various historical figures of Hobart College. The complex houses about 230 first-year and upper class Hobart and William Smith students. The building was completely renovated in 2005 to include quad living spaces (two double bed rooms connected by a common living room) and open lounge spaces and lounges on every floor.

'''Jackson Hall''' is named for Abner Jackson, president of the Hobart in the middle of the 19th century.  Jackson would go on to become president of [[Trinity College, Hartford|Trinity College]] in Connecticut, where he would be the principal designer of its present campus.

'''Rees Hall''' is named for Major James Rees, an early settler and landowner in Geneva and an acquaintance of George Washington.

'''Potter Hall''' is named for John Milton Potter, President of Hobart and William Smith Colleges from 1942 to 1947.

"The Village at Odells Pond" is a collection of apartment style dorms available to upperclassmen at the colleges. The units have either four or five bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a living room and a kitchen.

The surrounding ecosystem plays a major role in the Colleges' curriculum and acquisitions.  The Colleges own the {{convert|108|acre|km2|adj=on}} Hanley Biological Field Station and Preserve on neighboring [[Cayuga Lake]] and hosts the [[Finger Lakes Institute]], a non-profit institute focusing on education and ecological preservation for the Finger Lakes area.

On Seneca Lake one will find the ''William Scandling'', a Hobart and William Smith {{convert|65|ft|m|adj=on}} research vessel used to monitor lake conditions and in the conduct of student and faculty research.

The Colleges also own and operate [[WEOS]]-FM and [[WHWS-LP]], public radio stations broadcasting throughout the Finger Lakes and worldwide, on the web.

==Academics==
Hobart and William Smith Colleges offer the degrees of [[bachelor of arts]], [[bachelor of science]], and [[Master of Arts in Teaching]]. The colleges follow the semester calendar and have a student to faculty ratio of 11:1.

The colleges are known for the number of students that study abroad for a semester during the academic year; in recent years, between 40% and 60% of students have spent at least one semester studying off-campus. In former years, the majority of these terms abroad were led by faculty from the Colleges.

The Colleges have long been recognized for the high quality of their education and in 1961 were undefeated National Champions (an honor earned after winning five consecutive challenges) on the [[GE College Bowl]], one of only three institutions in the United States to achieve this distinction at the time. In 2004, a William Smith student was selected as a [[Rhodes Scholar]].

The Colleges have a long history of strength in interdisciplinary programs, including [[women's studies]] (well over 40 years old, and thus one of the first in the nation), [[Asian studies]], [[environmental studies]], and [[LGBT studies]].

In addition to the ''Seneca Review'', published on campus, from 2001 to 2004, Hobart and William Smith Colleges saw the publication of a literary magazine, ''SCRY!: A Nexus of Politics and the Arts''.  Under the editorial supervision of Binh Nguyen (Hobart '04), the magazine included contributions from both professionals and students.  The Canadian poet/classicist [[Anne Carson]] appeared twice. John O'Brien, the founder of The Center for Book Culture, contributed.  Award-winning on-campus writers, such as Jim Crenner, David Weiss, [[Deborah Tall]] and James McCorkle, submitted original poems.  There were writings and artworks by students as well.

===Trias Writers-in-Residence===
Founded in 2011 with a grant from alumnus [[Peter Trias]], Hobart and William Smith Colleges established the Trias Writer-in-Residence, which brings renowned authors to campus for a year to mentor undergraduate creative writing students. Former writers in residence have included [[Mary Ruefle]], [[Mary Gaitskill]], Tom Piazza, [[Chris Abani]], and [[John D'Agata]].

===Elizabeth Blackwell Award===
Given in her memory, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award is presented periodically by Hobart and William Smith Colleges to a woman who has demonstrated "outstanding service to humankind". Its recipients have included [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] [[Janet Yellen]] (2015), the Most Rev. [[Katharine Jefferts Schori]] (2013), [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]] (2011), first woman ordained a rabbi in the United States, Rabbi [[Sally Priesand]] (2009), [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine Albright]] (2001), tennis great [[Billie Jean King]] (1998), [[Wilma Mankiller]] (1996), first woman chief of the Cherokee Nation; [[U.S. Representative]] [[Barbara Jordan]] (1993), U.S. Senator [[Margaret Chase Smith]] (1991), former Surgeon General [[Antonia Novello]] (1991), Supreme Court Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] (1985), and [[Fe del Mundo]], the first Asian woman admitted to [[Harvard Medical School]] (1966), among many others.&lt;ref name=Recipients&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth Blackwell Award Recipients |url=http://www.hws.edu/about/blackwell.aspx|publisher=Hobart and William Smith Colleges|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===President's Forum===
Each semester, Hobart and William Smith sponsors a series of guest lectures. The most prominent has been the President's Forum, established in 2000 and led by former president [[Mark Gearan]]. The forum has included The Hon. [[Shireen Avis Fisher]], [[Nancy Zimpher]], [[Mary Matalin]] and [[James Carville]], [[Kathy Platoni]], [[Svante Myrick]], [[Cornel West]], [[Ralph Nader]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Eric Liu]], and [[Alan Keyes]], among other prominent names.

===Publications===
''Echo and Pine'' is the annual student-produced college yearbook. Originally two separate publications, the Hobart Echo of Seneca, and the William Smith Pine, the two merged in the 1960s to create one publication to serve both colleges.

''The Herald'' is the student-run school newspaper, founded in the late 19th century as the Hobart Herald.

''The Pulteney St. Survey'' is the official magazine of Hobart and William Smith Colleges.

''martini'' is the alternative student publication at Hobart &amp; William Smith Colleges.  Characteristically spelled with all lowercase letters, it provides a witty and critical look at music, politics, and social issues in a style that aspires to be "crisp, clean, and hard hitting". ''martini'' is published bi-weekly.

''Thel'' is the Colleges' literary magazine.

''Aleph'' is a journal of international travel, rooted in the colleges' strong study-abroad program.

=== Debate ===
The HWS Debate Team dates back over 100 years.  Notable recent victories include the Northeastern Regional Championship in both 2010 and 2011, the US National Championship in 2012 and winning the Hart House IV in 2016.  The team hosts the HWS IV (one of the largest tournaments in North America) each fall, and the HWS Round Robin (an international tournament of champions) each spring.  Every year, an HWS debater is honored with the Nathan D. Lapham Prize in Public Speaking, which comes with a cash award of up to $1000 to the student.  HWS is among the few liberal-arts colleges to offer numerous four-year debate scholarships.

===Music===

Hobart and William Smith has a number of ensemble groups, including:

'''Colleges Chorale''', which is a mixed ensemble comprising the finest vocal talent on the campus. The students accepted into this 45-voice ensemble have gone through a careful audition process involving evaluation of both vocal technique and musicianship. The Chorale performs a wide range of a cappella choral repertoire—music from the Middle Ages to the present day. In addition to a formal concert at the end of each semester and the annual spring tour, the Colleges Chorale performs at various campus events throughout the year. Each spring the group takes a four-day tour. Recent tour destinations have included New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Boston.

'''Cantori''' is a chamber vocal ensemble comprising members from the larger Colleges Chorale. Since the group's formation in 1993, the sixteen-member Cantori has sought to foster contemporary choral music through the Cantori Commissioning Project – the annual commissioning and performance of a new work by a deserving American composer.

'''Guitar Ensemble''',

==Coordinate system==
Officially chartered as "Hobart and William Smith Colleges," and informally referred to as "HWS" or "the Colleges," William Smith and Hobart have each retained its own traditions, while integrating many aspects of student life in an arrangement called the "coordinate system." When many single-sex institutions became co-ed in the 1960s and '70s, the Colleges, like others such as Columbia/Barnard, chose to maintain two separate entities, joined together in order to work as a whole. Though not donated for this purpose, a prior president, Richard H. Hersh, came to see the system as symbolized in the campus sculpture of a scissors embedded in the lawn south of the library.

[[File:Hws seneca lake.jpg|thumb|left|The colleges' campus borders Seneca Lake.]]

The colleges share most administrative offices (there is only one president's office, for example, which differentiates the Colleges from one or more other coordinate systems), while maintaining separate deans' offices, athletics programs, student governments and, until recently, admissions offices. Even some regulations about student life vary.  Hobart College allows [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] and Greek organizations while William Smith welcomed their first sorority onto campus in the Fall of 2017.

A male graduate receives a degree from Hobart College and a female graduate from William Smith College.  Alums are always referred to in the single-sex sense of the word, as "alumnae and alumni" and any reference to the institution is always in the plural ("colleges"). Of course, the coordinate system allows ease of transfer for those who transition from male to female or female to male during their time at the Colleges and thus offers a challenge both to single sex and co-educational systems.

Each college celebrates its own traditions. During the academic year, William Smith College celebrates annual events such as Founder's Day and Moving Up Day.  Hobart has Charter Day, which celebrates the 1822 founding and its own honor societies:  The Druid Society for seniors (founded 1903), Chimera Society (juniors, 1910) and Orange Key (sophomores, 1926).  The William Smith Senior Honor Society is Hai Timiai ("Honored Women" in Greek). Each society has specific roles and functions on campus. In 2016 the Colleges considered changing the structure of the traditional commencement ceremony. Ultimately the Board of Trustees, administration and student conducted surveys decided to leave the current system in place. The change would have resulted in a completely uniform ceremony of both Hobart and William Smith graduates. The current divides the colleges into Hobart College and William Smith College for men and woman respectively.

===Origins of the coordinate system===
Despite some sharing of facilities, at the beginning of their relationship the two colleges were quite separate. Classes were conducted in duplicate, and women students were not allowed on the Hobart campus. Those who required access to Trinity and Merritt halls (where chemistry and physics classes were held), the library, and the chapel traveled there on public sidewalks along the campus perimeter.

The enforced separation of the colleges eroded gradually over the years. In 1922, the first joint commencement was held, but baccalaureate services remained separate until 1942. By then, the practice of holding duplicate classes was less observed, particularly in upper-level courses with few students. In 1938, first-year courses were held in common, without any of the dire consequences some had predicted, and by 1941 [[coeducational]] classes had become the norm.

In 1943, during the administration of President [[John Milton Potter]], William Smith College was elevated from its original status as a department of Hobart College to an independent college, co-equal with Hobart. At President Potter's suggestion, the two colleges established a joint corporate identity. For a detailed explanation of the shared and structurally separate elements of the Colleges as they now exist, see '''Coordinate System''' below.

====Hobart seal====
Arthur Cleveland Coxe, the namesake of Bishop [[Arthur Cleveland Coxe]], his grandfather (for whom Coxe Hall is named), designed the seal in 1895. The Latin phrase "Sigillvm Collegii Hobartiani in Civ Neo Ebor", along the margin of the seal, translates as "The Seal of Hobart College in the State of New York," "Civ" being short for "Civitate" and "Ebor" for "Eboraco," the ablative case of Eboracum, the Latin name of York. "Vita Lux Hominvm", the phrase on the scroll, translates "Life and Light of Mankind." "Disce" is the Latin singular imperative (command) for "learn," and is a charge to the students to excel, while 1822 signifies the date of the College's charter. On the shield, the book represents learning and education, the cross, religion. The key on the left may symbolize knowledge. The crossing key, on the right, is symbolic of the bishop's crook, a reminder of the College's founder, Bishop Hobart.

====William Smith seal====
The seal of William Smith College depicts a lamp, which is the traditional symbol of enlightenment and education. Greek words meaning "life"  and "soul" are placed above the lamp. This suggests the College is concerned with all phases of life and attempts to meet both the physical and spiritual needs of the students. The date of the founding, 1908, is at the base of the lamp, and the inner field is surrounded by boughs of laurel

;History
Originally known as the Hobart Deacons, Hobart's athletic teams became known as the "Statesmen" in 1936, following the football team's season opener against [[Amherst College]]. The morning after the game, ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to the team as "the statesmen from Geneva," and the name stuck. The nickname for William Smith's athletic teams comes from a contest held in 1982. Several names were submitted, but "[[Heron]]s" was selected because of the strong and graceful birds that lived at nearby Odell's Pond. These ominous birds frequently flew over the athletic fields as the teams were practicing.

;Affiliations
The colleges compete in NCAA Division III, with the exception of men's [[lacrosse]], which competes in the Division I [[Northeast Conference]]. The colleges' main conference affiliation is with the [[Liberty League]] with the following exceptions: Hobart hockey competes in the [[New England Hockey Conferene]]; Hobart lacrosse competes in the Northeast Conference; William Smith ice hockey competes in the [[United Collegiate Hockey Conference]]; and the William Smith golf team is an independent.

;Facilities
Hobart and William Smith recently finished construction on the state of the art Caird Center for Sports and Recreation, which is now home to most of its athletics teams.

;Football
Offensive linesman [[Ali Marpet]], drafted in the 2nd round, 61st overall, of the [[2015 NFL draft]], is the highest-drafted pick in the history of [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] football.&lt;ref name="nbcsports.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/05/02/ali-marpet-puts-d3-hobart-on-the-nfl-draft-scoreboard/|title=Ali Marpet puts D3 Hobart on the NFL Draft scoreboard – College Football Talk|work=NBC Sports |author=Kevin McGuire|date=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was three-time All-[[Liberty League]] first team (2012, 2013, 2014), and 2014 Liberty League Co-Offensive Player of the Year—the first offensive lineman in league history to be so honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libertyleagueathletics.com/news/2014/11/19/FB_1119141022.aspx|title=Liberty League Athletics – Liberty League announces 2014 Football Award Recipients|work=Liberty League}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seniorbowl.com/news-highlights-detail.php?news=286|title=Press Release: News: Senior Bowl|work=seniorbowl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afca.com/article/article.php?id=2576|title=AFCA Announces 2014 Division III Coaches All-America Team|work=afca.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227094413/http://www.afca.com/article/article.php?id=2576|archivedate=February 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Statesmen lacrosse team has compiled fifteen national championships (1 USILA, 2 NCAA Division II, and 13 NCAA Division III).

;Golf
The Hobart Statesmen golf team is rich in history and tradition dating back to 1912.

;Field hockey
The William Smith field hockey team has captured three national championships, ascending to the top of Division III in 1992, 1997 and 2000.

;Sailing
The lone coed team, the HWS [[sailing]] team is a member of the [[Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association]]. In 2005, the Colleges won the [[Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association]] Team Race National Championship and the ICSA Coed Dinghy National Championship.

;Soccer
The William Smith soccer team was the first Heron squad to capture a national championship, winning the 1988 title bout with a 1–0 victory over [[University of California, San Diego]].  The Herons won their second national championship in 2013 with a 2–0 victory over Trinity University, Texas.

;Crew
The Hobart Crew team has also found success, earning gold medals at the Head of The Charles Regatta, the ECAC National Invitational Regatta (most recently a gold in the 2nd varsity 8+ over the "Hometown Boys" of WPI in 2015), and the IRA National Championships.  While the Hobart Crew team has won gold in every event they have entered since the inception of rowing as a Liberty League Sport, they failed to win the team championships only once (2004.) The eventual champions, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, were known for having a large team and only able to defeat the Statesmen by securing a win in the 2nd Varsity 8+ – the only event that Hobart did not have an entry. However, over the past few seasons Hobart has fielded one of the most dominant 2nd Varsity 8's in school history.  The Crew Team took part in the '''Henley Royal Regatta''' in '''Henley, England''' in the summer of 2011, as well as the summer of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.row2k.com/henley/features.cfm?ID=1216&amp;site=henley#.VZ2gM_lViko|title=Henley Thursday: Making the Most of Chances|website=row2k.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early History and Growth==

===Geneva Academy===
Geneva Academy was founded in 1796 when Geneva was just a small frontier settlement. It is believed to be the first school formed in Geneva.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.rays-place.com/ny/geneva-4.htm
|title=History of Ontario County – History of Geneva College in Geneva, New York. |accessdate=June 6, 2010|work=|publisher=D. Mason &amp; Company, Syracuse, N.Y., 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was considered "the gateway to Genesee County" and was in the early stages of development from the wilderness.&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt; Geneva Academy was founded by Rev. Henry Axtell. On May 3, 1796, a special meeting was held, as recorded in town of Seneca records, and three commissioners were chosen to receive the moneys granted by the state for the "use of schools."&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt;

In 1809, the trustees of the academy announced the engagement of the Rev. Andrew Wilson, formerly of the [[University of Glasgow]] in Scotland as head of the school.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; He remained until 1812 when Ransom Hubell, a graduate of [[Union College]], was made principal.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; The academy was granted a charter on March 29, 1813.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; In 1817, Hubbell was succeeded by the Rev. John S. Cook. On December 8, 1817, due to some "differences of feeling,"&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; a meeting of the board of trustees was held and it was decided the academy operations should be suspended. A committee was appointed consisting of the Rev. Henry Axtell, James Carter, and David Cook, to take charge of the school building and allow use by "any respectable teacher" until the trustees came to a decision and resumed their duties.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt;

The first meeting after the suspension took place on March 6, 1821. It was called by trustee James Rees to announce [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]] in [[New York City]] had bequeathed an endowment of $750 per annum to the school, specifically for the support of an academy at [[Fairfield, New York]].&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; One of the conditions of the grant from Trinity Church was Geneva residents should erect a building for the accommodation of the "Branch Theological School." Another stipulation required the site location be chosen by Bishop Hobart.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; Agreeable to the resolution, the bishop viewed several sites in Geneva and on March 17, 1821, he communicated to the trustees his selection of the college site.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; The Rev. Daniel McDonald D.D., formerly principal of the Fairfield Academy, was appointed principal of Geneva Academy.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; The academy reopened its doors on April 25, 1821, in a frame schoolhouse erected in 1817 in the rear of Trinity Church in Geneva.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt;

Early pioneers felt the need of "education advantages" beyond what the academy could provide. At the request of Trinity Church,&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; they began raising funds using voluntary labor and subscription. "They boldly built Geneva Hall before they applied to the state for a charter."&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt; By the spring of 1822,&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; sufficient community funds had been raised to complete Geneva Hall, a stone structure still in use today.

===Geneva College===
On April 10, 1822, Geneva College received a provisional charter. The State Regents of New York demanded the accumulation of funds yielding $4,000 per year before a permanent charter was granted. The college was accorded a three-year grace period to meet this requirement.&lt;ref name="charter"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hobart College, 125 Years Old, Prospers on Unusual. |newspaper=[[Rochester Democrat and Chronicle]] |location=Rochester, New York |date=June 1, 1947 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Regents granted the full charter on February 8, 1825, and at that time, Geneva Academy officially changed its name to Geneva College.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt; Rev. J. Adams was president of the college as of 1827.

[[File:Genevacollegedrawing1.jpg|thumb|left| Ad for Geneva College, 1841]]

Creative financing by the founders of Geneva College plagued their successors for several decades. In a marketing effort, the founders sent agents selling certificates, which for $100 entitled "the subscriber, his heirs and assigns, to the privilege of sending one student to the Geneva Academy (or to Geneva College) for 20 years, commencing from the date hereof or any time he choose."&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt;

The certificates became known as "The Little Old Men of the Sea," because decade after decade they were turned in for redemption and caused much consternation for the college fathers. Times changed and the cost of education and the cost of living in Geneva soared, leaving quite a financial burden for the school. The last certificate showed up in 1930 and was honored by Hobart College.&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt;

In 1824, a course in "practical business" was instituted, a creative concept during those days. "In direct reference to the practical business of life by which the Agricultural, the Merchant and the Mechanic may receive a practical knowledge of what genius and experience have discovered without passing through a tedious course of Classical Studies."&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt; This course was in addition to the traditional college program.&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt;

The "English Course," as it was known, was a radical departure from long established educational usage and represented the beginning of the college work pattern found today.&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt;

===Geneva Medical College===
[[File:Geneva medical college lg.jpg|thumb|Geneva Medical College]]
{{Main|Geneva Medical College}}

Geneva Medical College was founded on September 15, 1834, as a separate department (college) of Geneva College. The medical school was founded by [[Edward Cutbush]], who also served as the first dean for the school.&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt; In 1871, Hobart College disbanded the medical school and sold its library, anatomical specimens, and other tangible assets to Dean John Towler, who donated them to [[Syracuse University]] on condition the trustees immediately establish an [[American Medical Association]]-approved medical school. Thus the Syracuse University College of Medicine came into being on December 4, 1871, with Frederick Hyde as dean.&lt;ref name="syracuse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upstate.edu/com/about/history.php
|title=History of the College of Medicine |accessdate=June 4, 2010|work=|publisher=SUNY Upstate Medical Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of greatest prosperity for the school occurred between the years 1840 to 1850. During that time, 596 physicians graduated from the college.&lt;ref name="schoolhouse"/&gt;

===Elizabeth Blackwell===
[[File:P12b9.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Elizabeth Blackwell Class of 1849]]

Amid many distinguished male graduates was one woman. In an era when the prevailing conventional wisdom was no woman could withstand the intellectual and emotional rigors of a medical education, [[Elizabeth Blackwell (doctor)|Elizabeth Blackwell]], (1821–1910) applied to and was rejected – or simply ignored – by 29 medical schools before being admitted in 1847 to the Medical Institution of Geneva College.&lt;ref name="liz"/&gt;

The medical faculty, largely opposed to her admission but seemingly unwilling to take responsibility for the decision, decided to submit the matter to a vote of the students. The men of the College voted to admit her.&lt;ref name="lizzie"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_35.html
|title=Changing the Face of Medicine – Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell |accessdate=June 5, 2010|work=|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackwell graduated two years later, on January 23, 1849, at the top of her class to become the first woman doctor in the Northern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="liz"/&gt; "The occasion marked the culmination of years of trial and disappointment for Miss Blackwell, and was a key event in the struggle for the emancipation of women in the nineteenth century in America."&lt;ref name="liz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.hws.edu/library/archives/pdfs/tripp.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031212033218/http://academic.hws.edu/library/archives/pdfs/tripp.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 12, 2003|title=Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell's Graduation – An Eyewitness Account by Margaret Munro De Lancey|accessdate=June 5, 2010|work=|publisher=Hobart and William Smith Colleges}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackwell went on to found the [[Lower Manhattan Hospital|New York Infirmary for Women and Children]] and had a role in the creation of its medical college.&lt;ref name="liz"/&gt; She then returned to her native England and helped found the [[National Health Society]] and taught at the first college of medicine for women to be established there.

===Hobart College===
[[File:Presidentchair1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hobart President's Chair]]

The school was known as Geneva College until 1852, when it was renamed in memory of its most forceful advocate and founder, Bishop Hobart, to Hobart Free College. In 1860, the name was shortened to Hobart College.&lt;ref name="charter"/&gt;

[[File:Bishop hobart.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bishop Hobart.]]

Hobart College of the 19th century was the first American institution of higher learning to establish a three-year "English Course" of study to educate young men destined for such practical occupations as "journalism, agriculture, merchandise, mechanism, and manufacturing", while at the same time maintaining a traditional four-year "classical course" for those intending to enter "the learned professions."  It also was the first college in America to have a Dean of the College.

Notable 19th-century alumni included [[Albert J. Myer|Albert James Myer]], Class of 1847, a military officer assigned to run the [[United States Weather Bureau]] at its inception, was a founding member of the [[International Meteorological Organization]], and helped birth the [[U.S. Signal Corps]], and for whom [[Fort Myer, Virginia]], is named; General [[Edward S. Bragg|E. S. Bragg]] of the Class of 1848, colonel of the Sixth Wisconsin Regiment and a brigadier general in command of the [[Iron Brigade]] who served one term in Congress and later was ambassador to [[Mexico]] and consul general of the U.S. in [[Cuba]]; two other 1848 graduates, [[Clarence A. Seward]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.samueleells.org/SewardScholarships/SewardScholarshipAbout/ClarenceASeward/tabid/67/Default.aspx|title= A Brief History of Clarence A. Seward|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= |website= http://www.samueleells.org/|publisher= The Samuel Eells Literary and Educational Foundation|access-date= 2015-03-02|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150402154240/http://www.samueleells.org/SewardScholarships/SewardScholarshipAbout/ClarenceASeward/tabid/67/Default.aspx|archive-date= April 2, 2015|dead-url= yes|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas M. Griffith, who were assistant secretary of state and builder of the first national railroad across the [[Mississippi River]], respectively; and [[Charles J. Folger]], Class of 1836, a [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] in the 1880s.

Until the mid-20th century, Hobart was strongly affiliated with the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] and produced many of its clergy. While this affiliation continues to the present, the last Episcopal clergyman to serve as President of Hobart (1956–1966) was Louis Melbourne Hirshson. Since then, the president of the colleges has been a layperson.

During [[World War II]], Hobart College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name="navalyearbooks-v-12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/guides/yearbooks.htm |title=Naval Training and Education Yearbooks in the Navy Department Library |publisher=Department of the Navy |last= |first= |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding of William Smith College===
Toward the end of the 19th century, Hobart College was on the brink of bankruptcy. It was through the presidency of Langdon Stewardson the college obtained a new donor, nurseryman William Smith.  Smith had built the Smith Opera House in downtown Geneva and the Smith Observatory on his property when he became interested in founding a college for women, a plan he pursued to the point of breaking ground before realizing it was beyond his means. As publicized in The College Signal on October 7, 1903, "William Smith, a millionaire nurseryman, will found and endow a college for women at Geneva, N. Y., to be known as the William Smith College for Women The institution will be in the most beautiful section. One building is to cost $150,000. Mr. Smith maintains the Smith observatory there."&lt;ref&gt;"The College Signal" (Semi-monthly published by the Students of the Massachusetts Agricultural College) Vol. XIV. October 7, 1903. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, Hobart College President Langdon C. Stewardson learned of Smith's interest and, for two years, attempted to convince him to make Hobart College the object of his philanthropy. With enrollments down and its resources strained, Hobart's future depended upon an infusion of new funds.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:William Smith -- founder of William Smith College.jpg|thumb|right|William Smith.]] --&gt;
Unable to convince Smith to provide direct assistance to Hobart, President Stewardson redirected the negotiations toward founding a coordinate institution for women, a plan that appealed to the [[philanthropist]]. On December 13, 1906, he formalized his intentions; two years later William Smith School for Women – a coordinate, nonsectarian women's college – enrolled its first class of 18 students. That charter class grew to 20 members before its graduation in 1912.

In addition, Smith's gift made possible construction of the Smith Hall of Science, to be used by both colleges, and permitted the hiring, also in 1908, of three new faculty members who would teach in areas previously unavailable in the curriculum: biology, sociology, and psychology.

===World War II===
Between 1943 and 1945, Hobart College trained almost 1,000 men in the U.S. Navy's [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 program]], many of whom returned to complete their college educations when the post-World War II GI Bill swelled the enrollments of American colleges and universities. In 1948, three of those veterans – [[William Scandling|William F. Scandling]], Harry W. Anderson, and W. P. Laughlin – took over operation of the Hobart dining hall. Their fledgling business was expanded the next year to include William Smith College; after their graduation, in 1949, it grew to serve other colleges and universities across the country, eventually becoming [[Saga Corporation]], a nationwide provider of institutional food services.

==Title IX sexual assault investigation==
On May 1, 2014, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] released a list of 55 colleges being investigated for potential violations of federal law regarding [[sexual assault]] and harassment complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-list-higher-education-institutions-open-title-i|website=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list included Hobart and William Smith Colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-list-higher-education-institutions-open-title-i|website=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''[[New York Times]]'' article published in July of the same year detailed a case in which a student reported a sexual assault by three college football players two weeks into her first year; within two weeks the college's investigation cleared the two men accused, despite medical evidence, a corroborating witness to one of the incidents and discrepancies in the alleged perpetrators' accounts of the evening. The story also alleged the members of the disciplinary panel that heard the case were uninformed about sexual assault and frequently changed the subject rather than hear the victim's account of events.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bogdanich |first1=Walter|title=Reporting Rape and Wishing She Hadn't: How One College Handled a Sexual Assault Complaint|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/us/how-one-college-handled-a-sexual-assault-complaint.html|accessdate=13 July 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the report, the colleges unveiled new initiatives and policies, including revising their sexual violence policies, creating a rape hotline and forming an Office of [[Title IX]] Programs and Compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fltimes.com/news/new-initiatives-policies-greet-hws-students/article_2037b6fe-30b4-11e4-a4ac-0019bb2963f4.html|title=New initiatives, policies greet HWS students|last=Miller|first=Jim|website=Finger Lakes Times |access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydrogen darkening''' is a physical degradation of the [[Glass#Optical properties|optical properties]] of [[glass]]. Free hydrogen atoms are able to bind to the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[silica]] glass compound forming [[hydroxyl]] (OH)—a chemical compound that interferes with the passage of light through the glass.

The problem is particularly relevant to [[fiber optic cable]]s—particularly in oil and gas wells where fiber optic cables are used for [[distributed temperature sensing]]. Hydrogen can be present due to the [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] of [[hydrocarbon]]s in the well.  The darkening of the fiber can distort the DTS reading and possibly render the DTS system inoperable due to the [[optical loss budget]] being exceeded.

To prevent this, coatings such as [[carbon]] are applied to the fiber, and hydrogen capturing gels are used to buffer the fiber, and other proprietary techniques may be used to prevent hydrogen atoms from reaching the glass fiber via the [[cable sheath]].

In [[biology]], an '''identification key''' is a printed or computer-aided device that aids the [[identification (biology)|identification]] of biological entities, such as [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fossil]]s, [[microorganism]]s, and [[pollen]] grains.  Identification keys are also used in many other scientific and technical fields to identify various kinds of entities, such as [[disease]]s, [[soil type]]s, [[mineral]]s, or [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] artifacts.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Traditionally identification keys have most commonly taken the form of '''[[single-access key]]s'''. These work by offering a fixed sequence of ''identification steps'', each with multiple alternatives, the choice of which determines the next step.  If each step has only two alternatives, the key is said to be '''dichotomous''', else it is '''polytomous'''.  Modern '''[[multi-access key|multi-access]]''' or '''interactive''' keys allow the user to freely choose the identification steps and their order.

At each step, the user must answer a question about one or more features (''characters'') of the entity to be identified. For example, a step in a [[botany|botanical]] key may ask about the color of flowers, or the disposition of the leaves along the stems.  A key for [[insect]] identification may ask about the number of [[Chaetotaxy|bristle]]s on the rear leg.

==Principles of good key design==

Identification errors may have serious consequences in both pure and applied disciplines, including [[ecology]], medical diagnosis, [[pest (animal)|pest]] control, [[forensic]]s, etc.&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;
  [http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/bsc/news_19_2/error_rates.htm Steve Marshall]
&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, identification keys must be constructed with great care in order to minimize the incidence of such errors.

Whenever possible, the character used at each identification step should be ''diagnostic''; that is, each alternative should be common to all members of a group of entities, and unique to that group.  It should also be ''differential'', meaning that the alternatives should separate the corresponding subgroups from each other.  However, characters which are neither differential nor diagnostic may be included to increase comprehension (especially characters that are common to the group, but not unique).

Whenever possible, redundant characters should be used at each step.  For example, if a group is to be split into two subgroups, one characterized by six black spots and the other by four brown stripes, the user should be queried about all three characters (number, shape, and color of the markings) — even though any single one of them would be sufficient in theory.  This redundancy improves the reliability of identification, provides a consistency check against user errors, and allows the user to proceed even if some of the characters could not be observed. In this case, the characters should be ordered according to their reliability and convenience. Further error tolerance can be achieved by using [[reticulation (single-access key)|reticulation]].

The [[terminology]] used in the identification steps should be consistent in meaning and should be uniformly used. The use of alternative terms for the same concept to achieve more "lively prose" should be avoided.  Positive statements should be used in preference to negative statements.{{clarify|date=August 2009}}  The wording of the alternatives should be completely parallel sentences; alternatives like "flowers red, size 10-40 cm" versus "flowers yellow" should be avoided.

Geographic distribution characters should be used with caution. Species that have not been observed in a region may still occasionally occur there. Also, the [[organism]] may have been transported, particularly to locations near ports and airports, or it may have changed its range (e. g., due to [[global warming]]). For [[Europe]] and, probably, [[North Africa]] a [[Palaearctic]] key is advisable.

Rarity is not a viable character. An identification may be correct even though a species is very rare.

===Common problems in key usage===

Key users must overcome many practical problems, such as:

* ''Variant forms'': The key may identify only some forms of the species, such as adult males (or, more rarely, females). Keys for larvae identification may consider only the final [[instar]]. (This is not the case, however, of keys used in [[forensic entomology|forensic identification of fly larvae]].)
* ''Incomplete coverage'': Species and groups that are difficult to identify or that have been poorly characterized may have been left out of the key, or may be mentioned only in introductory text.
* ''Lighting and magnification'': Very few keys give details of how the specimen was viewed (the magnification, lighting system, angle of view etc.).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This can cause problems. The author may, for instance refer to tiny bristles, hairs or [[chaeta]]e—but how tiny?
* ''Language'': Very few keys are multilingual.&lt;ref name="timb"&gt;
  [http://delta-intkey.com/wood/index.htm Commercial Timbers], an example of a key in five languages. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of a key may be incorrect or misleading. Many keys contain vague words that do not translate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

* ''Obsolescence'': Older keys may not include more recently described species. They may also use outdated  [[scientific classification|species names]], which must then be mapped to the current ones.

==Verifying identifications==
The identification obtained from a key should be viewed as only a suggestion of the species's real identity. Full identification requires comparison of the specimen with some authoritative source, such as a full and accurate description of the species, preferably in a [[monograph]].  Many keys contain brief descriptions to allow more certain identification, but these should not be assumed sufficient for verification.

Comparison with a monographic description is often difficult in practice, as many monographs are expensive, out of print, written in foreign languages, or hard to obtain. Monographs are often several decades old, so that often the species names used in the key do not match those used in the monograph.

Another alternative is comparison with authoritatively identified specimens in natural history museums or other relevant repositories.  Authoritatively identified images are becoming more common on the internet.  To qualify, the image must be labeled with a ''voucher specimen'' number, the name of the scientist who identified the photographed specimen, and the name of the public institution where the specimen is housed (so that interested parties can re-examine the specimen themselves).

'''Intrinsic value''' exists wherever self-valuing beings exist &lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1996) "Forms of capital and intrinsic value," Chemosphere (1996) Vol. 33, No. 9, pp. 1801-1811. https://www.academia.edu/25475674/FORMS_OF_CAPITAL_AND_INTRINSIC_VALUES&lt;/ref&gt;. The intrinsic value of a human, or any other sentient animal, is the value it confers on itself by desiring its own lived experience as an end in itself. Because intrinsic value is self-ascribed, all animals have it, unlike instrumental or extrinsic values. Instrumental value is the value that others confer on an animal (or on any other entity) because of its value as a resource (e.g. as property, labour, food, fibre, 'ecosystem services') or as a source of emotional, recreational, aesthetic or spiritual gratification. Intrinsic values are conferred from within an animal, and are therefore not directly measurable by economists, while extrinsic values are conferred from outside and can, in principle, be measured econometrically.  

The phrase "intrinsic value" (often used synonymously with ''inherent value'') has been adopted by [[animal rights]] advocates. The Dutch ''Animal Health and Welfare Act'' referred to it in 1981: "Acknowledgment of the intrinsic value of animals means that animals have value in their own right and as a consequence their interests are no longer automatically subordinate to man's interests."&lt;ref&gt;Cock Buning, Tj. (2006). "Empirisch onderzoek naar morele oordeelsvorming bij genetische modificatie van dieren," ''NVBE Nieuwsbrief'', 13,3, 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt; This acknowledgement has stirred a debate on what it [[logical consequence|entails]] in the context of [[animal husbandry]], [[animal breeding]], [[vivisection]], [[animal testing]] and [[biotechnology]]. It is also used by environmental advocates and in law to holistically encompass the totality of intrinsic values in an ecosystem. Article 7(d) of New Zealand's ''Resource Management Act'' (RMA), for example, requires particular regard to be to given to "intrinsic values of ecosystems" &lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Parliament (1991) ''Resource Management Act'' http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1991/0069/latest/whole.html#DLM230267&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the moral status of animals (1880–1980) ==

Moral attitudes towards animals in the west (as expressed in public debate and legislation) have changed considerably over time. Britain's first anti-cruelty laws were introduced in the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]]. This was followed by similar laws in many other countries, especially in the second half of the 20th century. These laws did not challenge the idea that other animals are resources for human use and they only limited those acts of cruelty which (a) had few economic or social repercussions; and (b) were offensive to human sensibilities (the so-called [[Offence principle]]) or at odds with human dignity. These regulations were [[anthropocentric]] in character: they generally gave human economic and recreational interests, such as farming, fishing and blood sports, greater priority than animal suffering - that is they favoured the animals' instrumental values over their intrinsic ones. 

During the second half of the 20th century, the intensification of cattle breeding, the growth of pig and chicken factory farming and the increased use of animals in harmful laboratory experiments provoked fierce debates in which the negative consequences for the animals themselves became an issue. Notably during the 1960s and 1970s, pressure groups started to argue on behalf of the interests of animals kept in laboratories and farms. They expressed their discontent with laws that protected the institutional cruelty of the animal exploitation industries while only prohibiting selected acts of individual cruelty in certain situations. They called for new forms of legislation that would protect animals for non-[[anthropocentric]] reasons.

In these discussions (of the moral relevance of the animal's welfare) two key issues were involved. To begin with, the [[Harm principle]], rather than the [[Offence principle]], should be the moral foundation for the protection of animals. Secondly, as to the scepticism expressed by scientists regarding the presence of consciousness and self-awareness in animals, they should be granted the benefit of the doubt by adopting the so-called ''analogy postulate''. Applied [[ethology|ethological]] research into the behaviour of animals in captivity made it clear that the intensive use of animals had negative effects on the animal's health and well-being. Nevertheless, concern for the well-being of animals had to be purged from [[anthropomorphism]] and [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalism]]. This point of view is taken for example in a report by the Dutch Federation of Veterinarians in the EEC (FVE, 1978) concerning welfare-problems among domestic animals. This document states that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
although the interests of animals often conflict with the demands of society, society remains responsible for the welfare of the animals involved. Considerations regarding animal welfare ought to be based on veterinary, scientific and ethological norms, but not on sentiment. And although animals do not have fundamental rights, human beings have certain moral obligations towards them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Intrinsic value and animal ethics (1980–2000) ==
During the 1970s and 1980s, the criticism regarding the living conditions of farm and laboratory animals became mixed up with other social debates, notably the discussions concerning the protection of the (natural) environment and the ones concerning the development of new breeding techniques. Due to this broadening of the issues, other objections against the use of animals for scientific or economic reasons emerged. The instrumental use of the animals, it was said, is hard to reconcile with their ''intrinsic'' (or ''inherent'') value. In 1981 the Dutch government included the [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]-argument in a statement concerning the protection of animals (CRM, 1981). Now a principle was formulated that allowed for the possibility that, in some cases, the interests of animals might prevail over and above those of science and industry. The interests of the animal involved health and well-being as experienced by the animals themselves, independent from considerations concerning their suitability for human use. It was now claimed that animals have an [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]], that is a ''good-of-their-own'', and an interest in their own well-being.

Developments within the field of biotechnology broadened the scope of the debate on the moral status of animals even more. After the controversy concerning the transgenic bull Herman and the [[lactoferrin]] project of GenePharming, modern biotechnology has almost become a synonym for [[genetic engineering]]. In the debate on bull Herman, concern for the [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] of animals became an issue in its own right. Many felt that there was more to [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] than merely the concern for the animal's welfare. Since then, [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] not only refers to the animal's welfare, but also to the moral attitude society takes towards animals (or nature) as such. For some, this stance means a return to the [[Offence principle]], and therefore not helpful in the struggle against [[anthropocentrism]] or [[anthropomorphism]]. Others however maintain that recognition of the [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] of animals goes beyond [[animal welfare]], since it respects the animal as "centre of its own being".

== Analysis of the term ''intrinsic value'' ==
The cause of much confusion in the discussion over [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] in relation to the moral status of animals, is the diversity of meanings and connotations associated with [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]. Broadly speaking there are 4 main positions in this debate defining [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]. One can adhere to a meaning of [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] of animals in a sense that is:&lt;ref&gt;van der Tuuk, Edward. "Intrinsic value &amp; the struggle against anthropocentrism," in Dol, Marcel et al. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/l74rq21v5846474t/ ''Recognizing the Intrinsic Value of Animals''], APS, Van Gorcum, Assen, 1999, chapter 2, pp. 29–37. {{ISBN|90-232-3469-3}}&lt;!--it is the book or the article that is being referenced here?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[behaviourism|behaviouristic]], as a ''morally neutral'' value that the animal's ''own'' (hence ''intrinsic'') species-specific behaviour seeks to satisfy. Ethologists like [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and [[Gerard Baerends]] refer in this context to [[Expectancy-value theory|expectancy-values]] (see also [[ethology]])
* [[utilitarian]], as a ''formal'' basis to grant animals ''specific'' rights, based upon the idea of [[sentience]] and ''interests'', defined by [[ethology|ethological]] knowledge, and defines corresponding human obligations (see also [[Peter Singer]]'s ideas about [[Equal consideration of interests]])
* [[deontological]], as respect for the animal's ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' or [[Conatus|striving]] and consequential ''fundamental'' rights (see also [[Tom Regan]]'s ideas about ''inherent value'' and [[Tom_Regan#Animal_rights|animal rights]])
* [[respect|attitudinal]], as ''[[prima facie]]'' respect for all living beings, regardless of qualities like [[sentience]] (see also [[Reverence for Life]] and [[Ethical intuitionism]] and [[Moral sense theory]])

Of the first, [[behaviourism|behaviouristic]] interpretation, one can say (since it is ''morally neutral'') that it is useless to ethical theory. Of the fourth, attitudinal or intuitionistic interpretation, one can say that it is indiscriminate of sentience or interests, and could be used for any kind of (natural, cultural or abstract) entity worth protecting (including species, cultures, languages, historical buildings or sites, etc.). [[Animal_welfare#Animal_welfare_compared_with_animal_rights|The core issue in the debate over intrinsic value of animals remains between utilitarianists and deontologists]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5770">The '''John W. Kluge Prize''' for the Study of Humanity is awarded since 2003 for lifetime achievement in the humanities and social sciences to celebrate the importance of the Intellectual Arts for the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.loc.gov/loc/kluge/prize/|title= John W. Kluge Prize for Achievement in the Study of Humanity|publisher= Library of Congress|accessdate = 21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The prize is awarded by the [[John W. Kluge Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]].  The Prize is conferred in a ceremony in the Great Hall of the Jefferson Building, attended by American political leaders to dramatize America's commitment to these areas of human inquiry. The Prize winner will give an address, will remain in residence at the Library of Congress for a short time thereafter, and will be expected to have some informal interaction with Members of the [[United States Congress]].

Members of the [[Kluge Scholars' Council|Scholars' Council]], as described in the appended Charter of the John W. Kluge Center, and holders of the Kluge Chairs will be among those offering recommendations to the Librarian of Congress concerning recipients of the Kluge Prize.

Endowed by Library benefactor [[John Kluge|John W. Kluge]], the Kluge prize rewards lifetime achievement in the wide range of disciplines not covered by the [[Nobel Prize]]s. Such disciplines include history, philosophy, politics, anthropology, sociology, religion, criticism in the arts and humanities, and linguistics. The award is at the financial level of the Nobel awards.

The prize is international; the recipient may be of any nationality, writing in any language. The main criterion for a recipient of the Kluge Prize is deep intellectual accomplishment in the human sciences. The recipient's body of work should evidence growth in maturity and range over the years. The recipient will have demonstrated unusual distinction within a given area of inquiry and across disciplines in the human sciences. Significantly, the recipient's writings should be, in large part, understandable and important for those involved in public affairs.

==Candidates==

In order to ensure consideration of as wide a pool of candidates as possible, in 2001, the Librarian of Congress solicited nominations for the Kluge Prize from a broad range of individuals knowledgeable about the humanities and social sciences in colleges, universities, and research institutions across the globe, as well as from independent scholars and writers.

In 2002, the Librarian of the Library of Congress called upon a Scholars' Council of 20 preeminent scholars from around the world to consider the range of nominations. The council had been established to offer suggestions and advice on the choice of scholars to study at the John W. Kluge Center at the Library.

Based upon extensive research and further recommendations, the director of the Office of Scholarly Programs prepared a list of candidates for the Librarian's consideration in 2003. In addition to soliciting numerous outside reviews for each of these scholars, the Librarian called upon an expert staff of curators in the Library to conduct extensive biographical and bibliographical research as well as to gather published reviews and discussions of each candidate's work, prepare abstracts of translations of key articles from material available only in foreign languages, and provide a brief characterization and evaluation of the scholarly corpus of the candidate.

Finally, detailed dossiers on each candidate were sent to the members of the Final Kluge Prize Review Panel. Deliberating at the Library, this panel submitted its recommendations to the Librarian, who then made the final decision.

The '''Las Cruces Biological Station / Wilson Botanical Garden''' is located in the southern [[Puntarenas]] [[province]] of [[Costa Rica]],  and is the newest of the three [[research station]]s operated by the [[Organization for Tropical Studies]] (OTS).  Las Cruces includes a biological research station, tourist facilities, and the botanical gardens started by Robert and Catherine Wilson, and bequeathed to OTS.&lt;ref name="CRG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilson Botanical Gardens from CostaRicaGuide.com|url=http://costa-rica-guide.com/parks/wilson.htm|accessdate=2007-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heliconia hirsuta 1zz.jpg|thumb|A ''Heliconia hirsuta'' in the botanical garden of the station]]

Las Cruces is located in a mountainous region at an elevation of approximately 1,000 [[meters above sea level]] (m.a.s.l.).  Surrounded mostly by [[pastures]], [[Coffee_in_the_global_economy#Coffee_and_the_environment|coffee plantation]]s and other [[Farmland (farming)|agricultural areas]], Las Cruces includes a relatively small 270 Ha [[forest fragmentation|forest fragment]] that ranges from 900–1300 m.a.s.l.  As such, much of the research conducted here focuses on [[agroecology]] or studies of [[forest fragmentation]].

'''Dr. Leslie A. Baxter''' (born 17 January 1949 in [[Portland, Oregon]]), United States is a scholar and teacher in [[communication studies]], best known for her research on family and relational communication. Her work is focused on relationships: romantic, marital, and friendly. She is best known for her [[Relational dialectics|Relational Dialectics]] theory.

==Background==
Baxter attended [[Madison High School (Portland, Oregon)|Madison High School]] and graduated in 1964.

Dr. Baxter stayed in Portland during her college years and attended [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]], where she studied communications. She received a bachelor's degree in 1971 and continued her studies with Speech-Communication at the [[University of Oregon]], where she received her master's degree in 1972. In 1975, Baxter received a Ph.D. from the [[University of Oregon]] in Speech-Communication. She is currently a professor at [[University of Iowa]] in Communication Studies.

Dr. Baxter started her work as a professor at the [[University of Montana]] and served her time there from 1975 to 1976. From 1976 to 1989, she was a faculty member in the Communications Department at Lewis &amp; Clark College, where she had received her undergraduate degree. During the last two years at Lewis &amp; Clark, she was the Associate Provost. Dr. Baxter then moved to California where, from 1989 to 1994, she taught in the Rhetoric and Communication Department as well as the Human Development Graduate Group at the [[University of California-Davis]]. In 1994, she moved to [[Iowa]] where she started her career as a Communication Studies professor at the [[University of Iowa]]. From 2000 to 2010, she was the F. Wendell Miller Professor, where she held the maximum period of professorship. In 2004, Dr. Baxter was the secondary appointment in the College of Public Health, Department of Community &amp; Behavioral Health at the University of Iowa. In 2012, she became a Collegiate Fellow in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

==Scholarly work==

Dr. Baxter's work focuses on researching family and relational communication. Relational Dialectics Theory, which was created by Baxter and Barbara Montgomery, has been mentioned in books and scholarly journals and received awards. Relational Dialectics Theory is recognizing that all communication is the interplay of differences. Baxter has been awarded for her work in communication and dedication to teaching.

In one of her published articles, "Problematizing the Problem in Communication: A Dialogic Perspective," Baxter discusses the problems within dialogue. She compares her thoughts on dialogue to [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]’s dialogism. She also compares her ideas with relational dialectics with an interview conducted by Em Griffin, an author of ''A First Look at Communication Theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/video_transcript_11.pdf|title=Interview transcript, AFirstLook.com, January 2014|last=Griffin|first=Em|date=|website=A First Look|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes that differences in relationships are what give it a wholeness, where as Bakhtin’s reference to dialogue isn’t used in "the sense of a happy, pleasant experience".

For Baxter’s study on family communication, ''Topic Expansiveness and Family Communication Patterns'' discovers individual’s binary decision in engaging disclosure or avoidance within communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Leslie A.|last2=Akkoor|first2=Chitra|date=2011-01-14|title=Topic Expansiveness and Family Communication Patterns|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/15267431003773523|journal=Journal of Family Communication|volume=11|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/15267431003773523|issn=1526-7431}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study used 122 parents and their children to find communication patterns of avoidance, like sexual issues and topics of drinking/drugs, money, and educational progress. The topics were relative to friendships and everyday activities that would change the dialogue. The four topics of adolescent dating, family relationship rules, family relationship concerns, and traditions were the final grouped topics. ''Parental Rule Socialization for Preventive Health and Adolescent Rule Compliance'' looked into family rules rather than their communication pattern. Rules like nutrition, exercise, and sun protection in 164 families were examined. The outcome of this study showed that parents reported higher rule articulation than their children within the three topics. In 2014, another study was published about family communication. The study ''Discursive Constructions of the Meaning of "Family" in Online Narratives of Foster Adoptive Parents'' examined normativity of families, seeing if shared genetics established as a legitimate family. The study showed that it was the importance of dialogue of families that defined a "family", rather than how the family is constructed.

Leslie Baxter spent her career teaching and conducting research at universities around the Western part of the United States. One study to examine college student’s communication was to look at how 109 Midwestern university students used their health communication on a daily basis. The results were that impact of health communication varied by every topic, channel, relationship, and purpose whether that were to seek help for their health or have interpersonal communication (face-to-face, phone, and/or email).

Romantic relationships are another topic Dr. Baxter has researched. In one study done with William Wilmot, they used fourteen categories of tests in which lovers test the seriousness of their significant other’s commitment. They finalized results of women relying on secrets tests more often than men. For example, introducing their lover as "my boyfriend". They also concluded that men and women used different kinds of tests. A study done with Daena Goldsmith looked at communication in dating couples. They researched taboo subjects and what couples avoid talking about.

A '''maid''', or '''housemaid''' or '''maidservant''', is a female [[domestic worker]]. Although now usually found only in the most wealthy of [[households]], in the [[Victorian era]] domestic service was the second largest category of employment in England and Wales, after agricultural work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/census.html|title=Occupations: census returns for 1851, 1861 and 1871|work=victorianweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Maids were once part of an elaborate hierarchy in [[great house]]s, where the [[retinue]] of servants stretched up to the housekeeper and butler, responsible for female and male employees respectively. The word "maid" itself is short for "maiden", meaning a girl or unmarried young woman or virgin. Domestic workers, particularly those low in the hierarchy, such as maids and [[footmen]], were expected to remain unmarried while in service,&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''Essay XI''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Malthus, ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'', p.139&lt;/ref&gt; and even highest-ranking workers such as butlers could be dismissed for marrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1320949/Downstairs-Downton-Abbey-How-real-servants-worked-14-hour-days-maids-confined-virgin-quarters.html|title=Downstairs at Downton: How the real servants worked 14-hour days and the maids were confined to 'virgin quarters'|date=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Victorian England, all middle class families would have "help", but for most small households, this would be only one employee, the maid of all work, often known colloquially as "the girl".

Historically many maids suffered from [[Prepatellar bursitis]], an inflammation of the [[Prepatellar bursa]] caused by long periods spent on the knees for purposes of scrubbing and fire-lighting, leading to the condition attracting the colloquial name of "Housemaid's Knee".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://patient.info/health/housemaids-knee-prepatellar-bursitis|title = Housemaid's Knee (Prepatellar Bursitis)|work = Patient.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{See also|Foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong}}

In the contemporary [[Western world]], comparatively few households can afford live-in domestic help, usually relying on [[cleaner]]s, employed directly or through an agency ([[Maid service]]). Today a single maid may be the only [[domestic worker]] that upper-middle class households employ, as was historically the case. 

In less developed nations, various factors ensure a labour source for domestic work: very large differences in the income of urban and rural households, widespread poverty, fewer educated women, and limited opportunities for the employment of less educated women.

Maids perform typical domestic chores such as laundry, ironing, cleaning the house, grocery shopping, cooking, and caring for household pets. They may also [[child care|take care of children]], although there are more specific occupations for this, such as [[nanny]]. In some poor countries, maids take care of the elderly and people with disabilities. Many maids are required by their employers to wear a [[uniform]].

Legislation in many countries makes certain living conditions, working hours, or minimum wage a requirement of domestic service. Nonetheless, the work of a maid has always been hard, involving a full day, and extensive duties.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} 

==Types==
[[File:Joshua Reynolds - George Clive and his Family with an Indian Maid - WGA19338.jpg|thumb|right|[[George Clive (died 1779)|George Clive]] and his family with an Indian maid, painted 1765. As she appears to be caring for the child, she may be an ''[[Amah (occupation)|ayah]]''.]]
Maids traditionally have a fixed position in the hierarchy of the large households, and although there is overlap between definitions (dependent on the size of the household) the positions themselves would typically be rigidly adhered to. The usual classifications of maid in a large household are:

* [[Lady's maid]]: a senior servant who reported directly to the [[lady]] of the house, but ranked beneath the [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|Housekeeper]], and accompanied her lady on travel. She took care of her mistress's clothes and hair, and sometimes served as confidante. 
* House-maid or housemaid: a generic term for maids whose function was chiefly "above stairs", and were usually a little older, and better paid. Where a household included multiple housemaids the roles were often sub-divided as below.
** Head house-maid: the senior house maid, reporting to the Housekeeper. (Also called "House parlour maid" in an establishment with only one or two upstairs maids).
** Parlour maid: they cleaned and tidied reception rooms and living areas by morning, and often served refreshments at [[afternoon tea]], and sometimes also dinner. They tidied studies and libraries, and (with footmen) answered bells calling for service.&lt;ref&gt;A Parlour Maid's timetable is summarised [http://chestofbooks.com/food/household/Woman-Encyclopaedia-1/Parlourmaid-s-Time-Table.html in this webpage] extract from a book.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Chamber maid: they cleaned and maintained the bedrooms, ensured fires were lit in fireplaces, and supplied hot water.
** Laundry maid: they maintained bedding and towels. They also washed, dried, and ironed clothes for the whole household, including the servants.
** Under house parlour maid: the general deputy to the house parlour maid in a small establishment which had only two upstairs maids.
* [[Nursemaid|Nursery maid]]: also an "upstairs maid", but one who worked in the children's nursery, maintaining fires, cleanliness, and good order. Reported to the [[Nanny]] rather than the Housekeeper.
* [[Kitchen maid (domestic worker)|Kitchen maid]]: a "below stairs" maid who reported to the Cook, and assisted in running the kitchens.
** Head kitchen maid: where multiple kitchen maids were employed, the "head kitchen maid" was effectively a [[line cook|deputy to the cook]], engaged largely in the plainer and simpler cooking (sometimes cooking the servants' meals).
** Under kitchen maid: where multiple kitchen maids were employed these were the staff who prepared vegetables, peeled potatoes, and assisted in presentation of finished cooking for serving.
* [[Scullery maid]]: the lowest grade of "below stairs" maid, reporting to the cook, the scullery maids were responsible for washing cutlery, crockery, and glassware, and scrubbing kitchen floors, as well as monitoring ovens while kitchen maids ate their own supper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianlifestyle.org/?cat=14|title=Victorian Life Style|work=victorianlifestyle.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Between maid]]: roughly equivalent in status to scullery maids, and often paid less, the between maids in a large household waited on the senior servants ([[butler]], [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]], and [[Cook (domestic worker)|cook]]) and were therefore answerable to all three department heads, often leading to friction in their employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourwardfamily.com/victorian_servants.htm|title=ourwardfamily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes known by the name 'tweeny'.
* [[Still room maid]]: a junior maid employed in the [[still room]]; as the work involved the supply of alcohol, cosmetics, medicines, and cooking ingredients across all departments of the house, the still room maids were part of the "between staff", jointly answerable to all three department heads.

In more modest households a single '''maid-of-all-work''' or '''skivvy''' was often the only staff. It is possible this word originates from the Italian for slave ("schiavo"—"owned person").

==In popular culture==
One of the most in-depth and enduring representations of the lives of several types of maid was seen in the 1970s television drama ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]]'', set in [[England]] between 1903 and 1936. Another representation of the lives of maids is seen nowadays in ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', set in England between 1912 and 1926.

==In Middle East countries==

Foreign women are employed in Middle East and African countries ([[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Somalia]], [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Nigeria]], [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) and others) in large numbers to work as maids and domestic servants and are often vulnerable to sexual abuse, violence and poor living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2008/07/07/if-i-am-not-human/abuses-against-asian-domestic-workers-saudi-arabia|title="As If I Am Not Human" - Abuses against Asian Domestic Workers in Saudi Arabia|date=7 July 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the guardian1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/13/saudi-arabia-treatment-foreign-workers |date=13 January 2013| title=Saudi Arabia's treatment of foreign workers under fire after beheading of Sri Lankan maid |last=Chamberlain |first=Gethin |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humanrightswatch1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Human Rights Watch |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=printdoc&amp;amp;docid=412ef32a4| title='Bad Dreams:' Exploitation and Abuse of Migrant Workers in Saudi Arabia |publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |date= 14 July 2004 |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7885">'''Mamai–Hora''' is the largest multicomplex burial mound of national importance in the Northern Black Sea region. It is located on the left bank of the [[Kakhovka Reservoir]] near the village of [[Великая Знамянка|Velyka Znamianka]] in [[Kamianka-Dniprovska Raion|Kamiansko-Dniprovsk district]], [[Zaporizhia Oblast|Zaporizhzhia oblast]].

== History of site studies ==
The plan of the burial ground was first drawn by [[Boris Grakov|B. N. Grakovs's]] expedition in 1946–1947; later in 1976 it was edited by the Institute of Archaeology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. In 1988 a study was carried out by the archaeological expedition led by G. M. Toshchev and S. I. Andrukh. The first years of excavations were focused on studying of small hillocks. In the early 90s, aerial photography and an additional topographical survey were carried out.  As a result, both hundreds of separate "spots" and joined ones were documented.  Also, the approximate boundaries of the burial mound were determined; its size covered some 30 ha. It is possible that the original footprint of the site was substantially larger, and reduced considerably due to the loss of more than 300 meters of shoreline after the [[Kakhovka Reservoir]] was created. Supporting this conjecture, destroyed burials in close proximity to the water have been unearthed. Since the middle of the 90s, archaeological work have been done manually. In total, about 8 hectares of the site have been studied. More than 600 funeral complexes, concentrated in burial mounds and soil burial grounds or individual burials have been identified.

== Cultures ==

=== Neolithic and Eneolithic periods ===
26 [[Neolithic]] and 4 [[Eneolithic]] burials were discovered in total. The grave goods are represented by clay pottery and adornments made of red deer teeth. [[Inhumation]] was carried out both in soil burial grounds and burial mounds.

=== The Bronze Age ===
A tradition of erecting burial mounds ([[kurgan]]s) became widespread in the [[Bronze Age]]. The burials of all known cultures of that age have been found in the earthen hillocks studied at Mamai-Hora, i.e. the [[Pit-Grave]], [[Catacomb]], [[Multi-cordoned ware culture|Multiroller ceramics]] and [[Srubna culture|Logs cultures]]. Each of them had its own specific funeral practices, burial rites and grave goods made of clay, bronze, stone, and flint. Trees were often used in burials, namely oak and ash. A vault was revealed next to one of the mounds, that was a pit with ore from which the paint was burned and a lavishly ornamented Catacomb culture vessel found.

==== The Pit-Grave culture ====
The [[Pit-Grave]] culture is represented by 14 locations, both burial mounds and burial grounds. Grave goods – decorated pottery.

==== The Catacomb culture ====
The main [[Catacomb culture]] burials are soil burials, but several of them were dug into the Eneolithic period burial mounds. In total there are 33 burials. Grave goods are sparse, represented by clay pottery and cult axes.

==== The Multiroller ceramics culture ====
There are only nine burials of the Babyno culture ([[Multi-cordoned ware culture|Multiroller ceramics culture]]).

==== The Bilozerska culture ====
The Bilozerska culture soil burial ground contains 5 burials.

==== The Novocherkassk culture ====
The fault line between the Bronze Age and the early Iron Age is marked by two burials of the [[Novocherkassk culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Тощев Г. Н. Памятники предскифского времени на Мамай-Горе // Древнее Причерноморье. – IX. – Одесса, ФЛП «Фридман А. С.», 2011. — С. 494—495&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Scythians === 
The earliest [[Scythian]] burial dates to the end of the VII-VI centuries BC. The rest of the complexes come from the period of the 5th–4th centuries BC. The total number of burials from this period is 370.&lt;ref&gt;Андрух С. И., Тощев Г. Н.

И. Могильник Мамай-Гора. Кн. ІІ. – Запорожье, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The grave goods are varied. This is pottery both locally produced and imported from the Greek centers. Weaponry is represented by differently sized swords, darts, spear points and arrowheads. Amidst adornments, there are bracelets, hryvnias, pendants, earrings, rings, plaques and beads. A [[Sarmatian]] burial was inlet into the Scythian kurhan.

=== The Polovtsians ===
Two [[Polovtsian]] soil burials have been excavated. The rest were inlet into earlier-period hillocks or formed independent complexes. 25 burials were revealed. The varied grave goods are represented by ornaments, household objects, and weapons.

=== The Golden Horde ===
A burial ground dating back to the 1st half of 14th century has been excavated. 19 nomadic burials and a cult pit of the [[Golden Horde]] period have been researched. Weapons, details of horse harnesses, belt buckles, earrings, awls, beads, and remains of headwear were found in male burials; ornaments, household objects, and remains of headwear in female burials. Beads were found in children's burials. A kurgan burial ground dating back to the mid-second half of the XIV century has also been found. In all 23 burials were revealed. The main burials were in five hillocks, while  the rest were inlet into the Scythian period kurgans. Also, 700 meters to the south of Mamai-Hora burial mounds, the Mamai-Surka burial ground dating back to the end of the 13th and beginning of the 15th century was researched. 1162 of its burials were studied.&lt;ref&gt;Ельников М.

=== The Late Middle Ages ===
A new surge of active use of the site as a cemetery can be dated to the 15th century. In 2015, 126 graves forming a soil burial ground dating to this time were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Тощев А. Г.

== Relevance and causes ==

=== Theory of mind ===
Mind-blindness is a state where the ToM has not been developed, or has been lost in an individual. According to the theory, ToM is implicit in neurotypical individuals. This enables one to make automatic interpretations of events taking into consideration the mental states of people, their desires and beliefs. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] described how an individual lacking a ToM would perceive the world in a confusing and frightening manner, leading to a withdrawal from society.&lt;ref name=cohen1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baron-Cohen |first=Simon |title=Autism: a specific cognitive disorder of 'mind-blindness |journal=[[International Review of Psychiatry]] |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |year=1990 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=81–90 |doi=10.3109/09540269009028274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative approach to the social impairment observed in mind-blindness focuses on emotion of subjects. Based on empirical evidence, [[Uta Frith]] concluded that the processing of complex cognitive emotions is impaired compared to simpler emotions. In addition, attachment does not seem to fail in the early childhood of autistics. This suggests that emotion is a component of social cognition that is separable from [[mentalization|mentalizing]].&lt;ref name=cory /&gt;

Lombardo and Cohen updated the theory and pinpointed some additional factors that play an important part in ToM of autistic people. They highlighted that the middle [[cingulate cortex]] which is outside the traditional mentalizing region was underactive in autistic patients, while the rest of ToM activation was normal. This region was important in deciding how much to invest in a person and hence required mentalization.&lt;ref name=lamcohen&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lombardo |first=Michael V. |author2=Baron-Cohen, Simon |title=The role of the self in mindblindness in autism |journal=[[Consciousness and Cognition]] |publisher=[[Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness]] |date=1 March 2011 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=130–140 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.09.006 |pmid=20932779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological basis ===
Neural correlates of the ToM point towards three regions of the brains. The anterior paracingulate cortex (Brodmann), is considered at the key region of mentalizing. It is located anterior corpus callosum and the anterior cingulate cortex. This cortex is associated with the medial frontal cortex where activation is associated with the mentalization of states. The cells of the ACC develops at the age of 4 months suggesting that the manifestations of mind-blindness may occur around this time.&lt;ref name=perry&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gallagher | first=Helen L. | author2=Frith, Christopher D. | title=Functional imaging of 'theory of mind' | journal=[[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] | publisher=[[Cell Press]] | location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] | date=1 February 2003 | volume=7 | issue=2 | pages=77–83 | doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)00025-6 | pmid=12584026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the anterior paracingulate cortex is the superior temporal sulcus and the temporal poles that are involved with the ToM and its nature. However, these areas are not uniquely associated with mentalization. They aid in the activation of the regions that are associated with the ToM. The superior temporal sulcus is involved in the processing of behavioural information while the temporal poles are involved in the retrieval of personal experiences. These are considered important regions for the activation of the ToM regions and are associated with the mind-blindness. The temporal poles provide personal experiences for mentalization such as facial recognition, emotional memory and familiar voices. In patients suffering from semantic dementia, the temporal regions of these patients undergo atrophy and lead to certain deficits which can cause mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=perry /&gt;

[[File:250px-Gray726-STS.png|thumb|right|Superior temporal sulcus]]
The amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex also are a part of the ToM.  It is in involved in the interpretation of behaviour which plays an important role in social cognition and therefore contributes to the theory of the mind. It is suspected that the damage to the orbitofrontal cortex brings upon subtle impairments, but not a total loss of the ToM that would to mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=perry /&gt; Some studies{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} have shown that the orbitofrontal cortex is not directly associated with the theory of the mind or mind-blindness. However, a study by Stone and colleagues were able to show impaired ToM on mentalisation tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stone | first=V.E. | last2=Baron-Cohen | first2=S. | last3=Knight | first3=R.T. | title=Frontal lobe contributions to the theory of mind | journal=[[Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience]] | publisher=[[MIT Press]] | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | date=September 1998 | volume=10 | pages=640–656 | doi=10.1162/089892998562942 | pmid=9802997 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the frontal lobe is associated with executive function, researchers theorize that the frontal lobe plays an important role in ToM and its associated nature. It has also been suggested that the executive function and the theory of mind share the same regions.&lt;ref name=jose&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Josef Perner  | author2=Birgit Lang | lastauthoramp=yes | title=Development of theory of mind and executive control | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | publisher=Cell Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | date=1 September 1999 | volume=3 | issue=9 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01362-5 | pages=337–344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that ToM and mind-blindness can explain executive function deficits, it is argued that autism is not identified with the failure of the executive function.&lt;ref name=Peter&gt;{{cite book | last=Carruthers | first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Carruthers (philosopher) | editor1=Carruthers, Peter | editor2=[[Peter K. Smith|Smith, Peter K.]] | title=Theories of Theories of Mind | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CtJ6BFChp9IC&amp;printsec=frontcover |chapter=Chapter 16.

Lesion studies show that when lesions are imposed to the medial frontal lobe, performance on mentalization tasks is reduced, similar to typical mind-blindness cases.&lt;ref name=tom&gt;{{cite journal | authors=Havet-Thomassin, P. Allain, F. Etcharry-Bouyx, &amp; D. le Gall | title=What about theory of mind after severe brain injury? | journal=[[Brain Injury (journal)|Brain Injury]] | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | date=2006 | volume=20 | issue=1 | pages=83–91 | doi=10.1080/02699050500340655 | pmid=16403703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients that experienced frontal lobe injuries due to severe head trauma showed signs of mind blindness, as a result of a lost ToM. However, it is still debated whether the inactivation of the medial frontal lobe is involved in mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bird|first=C. M.|title=The impact of extensive medial frontal lobe damage on 'Theory of Mind' and cognition|journal=[[Brain (journal)|Brain]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=14 January 2004|volume=127|issue=4|pages=914–928|doi=10.1093/brain/awh108|pmid=14998913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frith and Frith proposed that a neural network that comprised the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex and the STS, is crucial for the normal functioning of ToM and self monitoring. This so formed dorsal system is crucial for social cognition. Disruption of this neural network leads to mind-blindness in schizophrenic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frith | first=Uta | author2=Frith, C.D | title=The biological basis of social interaction | journal=[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] | location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]] | date=October 2001 | volume=10 | pages=151–155 | issue=5 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another clue towards a possible explanation of mind-blindness in autistics was done by Castelli and colleagues. They were able to show that the connectivity between occipital and the temporo-parietal regions were weaker in the autistic group than the control group. The under activation of this network may inhibit the interactive influences between regions that process higher and lower perceptual items.&lt;ref name=cory /&gt;

=== Relationship to diagnostic criteria ===

=== Relationship to autism ===
Mind-blindness is usually associated with [[Autism|autistic]] people. Lower performance on the mentalization tasks were the first screening task used to diagnose the autism, with a good prediction level.&lt;ref name=cory /&gt;

Cohen proposed the mind-blindness theory of autism as "deficits in the normal process of empathising". He described empathising to include the ToM, mind reading and taking an intentional stance. According to this view empathising includes the ability to attribute mental states and to react in an appropriate emotional manner which is appropriate to another's mental state.  More deficits tend to occur in reference to one's own mental states compared to the other's mental states. It has been proposed that autistic people undergo a specific developmental delay in the area of metarepresentational development. The delay facilitates mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=cohen2&gt;{{cite journal | last=Baron-Cohen |first=S. | title=The cognitive neuroscience of autism | journal=[[Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry]] | publisher=[[BMJ (company)|BMJ]] | location=London | date=1 July 2004 | volume=75 | issue=7 | pages=945–948 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.2003.018713| pmc=1739089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that suggests that certain patients develop a rudimentary ToM and do not suffer from complete lack of ToM causing mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=cohen2 /&gt; A study by Bowler concluded that mind-blindness and social impairment is not as straightforward as previously thought. It showed that a complete possession of ToM was not enough to protect from social impairments in autistic people. Conversely the absence or impairment of the ToM that leads to mind-blindness does not lead to social impairments.&lt;ref name=bowler&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bowler | first=Dermont. M. | title=Theory of Mind in Asperger's syndrome | journal=[[Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry]] | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | location=Hoboken, New Jersey | date=July 1992 | volume=33 | issue=5 | pages=877–893 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1992.tb01962.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social and cognitive differences seen in autistic people are often attributed due to mind blindness. Abnormal behaviour of autistic children are perceived to include a lack of reciprocity. Some cases in which mind-blindness manifests includes the child being totally withdrawn from social settings as well as not being able to make eye contact while in other cases the individual may attempt to interact with other people. However, global asocial behaviours is not the rule in autism. Cohen described the cognitive/mind-blindness effects in autistic people as a "triad of deficits". The triad consists of deficits in social, communication and imagination of others' mind.&lt;ref name=cohen2 /&gt;

Ozonoff and colleagues were able to discriminate between autistic people diagnosed with [[Asperger's syndrome]] and other autistic people by their ability to solve ToM tasks. It is due to those diagnosed with AS seem more neurotypical in development early on in childhood. The siblings of individuals diagnosed with AS were shown to have a lesser variant of ToM deficits. This shows that the cognitive deficits that affect the ToM play central role in the phenotype expressed in AS diagnosed.&lt;ref name=ozonoff&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ozonoff | first=S | author2=Rogers, S. &amp; Pennington, B. | title=Asperger's syndrome: Evidence for an empirical distinction from high-functioning autism | journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | location=Hoboken, New Jersey | date=November 1991 |volume=32 | issue=7 | pages=1107–1122 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1991.tb00352.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship to schizophrenia ===
People with [[schizophrenia]] also show deficits associated with mind-blindness.&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"/&gt; However, there is an ongoing debate as to whether individuals with schizophrenia have an impaired ToM leading to mind-blindness or display an exaggerated ToM. Unlike autism, schizophrenia is a late onset condition. It is speculated that this difference in the condition may account for differences seen in the ToM abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Other Minds. How Humans Bridge the Divide Between Self And Others | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJqB_NboEYYC&amp;printsec=frontcover | origyear=[https://books.google.com/books?id=UxE1nwEACAAJ 2005] | year=2007 | publisher=[[Guilford Press]]| location=New York City | author=Langdon, Robyn |editors=Malle, Bertram F.; Hodges, Sara D. |chapter=Chapter 21.

It is unknown whether the ToM in schizophrenia deteriorates in the affected person as the condition progresses.&lt;ref name= brune /&gt;

The cognitive impairment linked to mind-blindness is best explained by a modular theory; the domain specific capabilities that account for mindreading and mentalization are lost in schizophrenia. Furthermore, Frith has predicted that the extent of mind-blindness depends on whether the objective/behavioural or subjective symptoms of ToM abilities prevail.&lt;ref name=cory /&gt; Patients with the behavioural symptoms perform the poorest in ToM tasks, similar to autistic subjects, while patients displaying subjective/experiential symptoms have a ToM. However, these patients are impaired in using contextual information to infer what these mental states are.&lt;ref name= brune /&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The mind-blindness theory helps to explain the impairment in the social development of individuals as well as the impairment in the communication skills of autistics. However one of the most important limitations of this theory is that it is unable to explain the highly repetitive behaviours which is a characteristic trait attributed to autistic people. This triad is explained through the process of systemising.&lt;ref name=cohen2 /&gt; The theory also did not account for the motor problems and the superior rote memory skills that were associated with autism.&lt;ref name=cory /&gt; These aspects along with the highly repetitive behaviours formed the triad of strengths. Simon Baron-Cohen himself has acknowledged that the theory, while adept at explaining the communications difficulties experienced by autistic people, fails to explain such patients' penchants for narrowly defined interests, an important step to proper diagnosis.  Furthermore, mind-blindness seems decidedly non-unique to autistic people, since conditions ranging from [[schizophrenia]] to various [[narcissistic personality disorder]]s and/or [[anti-social personality disorder]]s all exhibit mind-blindness to some degree.&lt;ref name="cohen" /&gt;

Another issue associated with the mind-blindness theory is that researchers are unable to predict whether the social deficits are a primary or secondary result of mind-blindness. In addition, Klin and his fellow researchers highlighted another limitation that was that the mind-blindness theory failed to delineate whether the ToM deficits are a generalised deficit or a specific discrete of a mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Klin, Ami., Folkmar, Fred R., Sparrow, Sara S.| title=Autistic Social Dysfunction: Some limitations of the Theory of Mind hypothesis | journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | location=Hoboken, New Jersey | date=July 1992 | volume=33 | issue=5 | pages=861–876 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1992.tb01961.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Shanker also argued in favour of Klin's argument, that a major part of the mind-blindness theory depicts the ToM as an autonomous cognitive capacity compared to being part of a more general ability for reflective thinking and empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Shanker | first=S. | title=The Roots of Mindblindness |journal=[[Theory &amp; Psychology]] | date=1 October 2004 | volume=14 | issue=5 | pages=685–703 | doi=10.1177/0959354304046179}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Autism-stacking-cans 2nd edit.jpg|thumb|A boy with autism, obsessively stacking cans.]]

Other researchers have pointed out the inherent flaws of assuming autistic traits develops from a "theory of mind" deficit, pointing out that this presupposes autistic traits derives from a single, core insufficiency within the brain.  This contrasts, they say, with the very same researchers' description of autism as a "puzzle", which implies a far more diverse range of causes than a single, unifying theory.&lt;ref name="smukler"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Smukler, David | title=Unauthorized Minds: How 'Theory of Mind' Theory Misrepresents Autism | journal=Mental Retardation | date=February 2005 | volume=43 | issue=1 | pages=11-24 | doi=10.1352/0047-6765(2005)43&lt;11:UMHTOM&gt;2.0.CO;2 | pmid=15628930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have also pointed out that Mind-blindness wrongly categorizes autism as a problem to be fixed, rather than a condition to be accommodated. This assumes an inherent lack of [[intelligence]] in autistic people, which ignores the nuanced view of intelligence (as in varying types of intelligence) that has been observed in cognitive research.&lt;ref name="smukler" /&gt;

The drawbacks in the Mind-blindness theory of autistic people paved way for the [[Empathizing–systemizing theory|E-S theory]] which helps to explain the observations seen in these individuals. The E-S theory accounts for both the triad of deficits which is the loss of empathising and the triad of strengths is related to hyper systemisation of certain behaviours. The theory also helps to explain the exaggerated male spectrum termed as the extreme male behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Baron-Cohen | first=S. | author2=Knickmeyer, Rebecca S. | author3= Belmonte, Mathew S. | title=Sex Differences in the Brain: Implications for Explaining Autism | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] | date=4 November 2005 | volume=310 | issue=5749 | pages=819–823 | doi=10.1126/science.1115455 | pmid=16272115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species use restricted [[ecological niche]]s, and the niches of all species are '''segregated''', often with much overlap, by the use of different habitats, different geographic areas and seasons, and different food resources, to mention only a few of the many niche dimensions. The causes of niche restriction and segregation are important problems in evolutionary ecology.

==Background==
Two ecological paradigms deal with the problem. The first paradigm predominates in what may be called “classical” ecology. It assumes that niche space is largely saturated with individuals and species, leading to strong competition. Niches are restricted because “neighbouring” species, i.e., species with similar ecological characteristics such as similar habitats or food preferences, prevent expansion into other niches or even narrow niches down. This continual struggle for existence is an important assumption of [[natural selection]] introduced by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] as an explanation for evolution.

The other paradigm assumes that niche space is to a large degree vacant, i.e., that there are many [[vacant niches]]. It is based on many empirical studies &lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1980. Warum sind ökologische Nischen begrenzt?  Zwischenartlicher Antagonismus oder innerartlicher Zusammenhalt?  Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 33, 98-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 2005a. Eine neue Ökologie. Aktuelle Probleme der evolutionären Ökologie. Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 58, 420-426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)"&gt;K. Rohde: Nonequilibrium Ecology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. auf http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553&lt;/ref&gt; and theoretical investigations especially of Kauffman 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, S.A. 1993. The origins of order. Self-organization and selection in evolution. Oxford University Press, New York Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Causes of vacant niches may be evolutionary contingencies or brief or long-lasting environmental disturbances.

Both paradigms agree that species are never “universal” in the sense that they occupy all possible niches; they are always specialized, although the degree of specialization varies. For example, there is no universal parasite which infects all host species and microhabitats within or on them. However, the degree of host specificity varies strongly. Thus, ''Toxoplasma'' (Protista) infects numerous vertebrates including humans, ''Enterobius vermicularis'' infects only humans.

The following mechanisms for niche restriction and segregation have been proposed:

== Niche restriction ==

# Species must be specialized in order to survive. They may survive for a while in less optimal habitats under favourable conditions, but they will be extinguished when conditions become less favourable, for example due to changed weather conditions (this aspect was especially emphasized by Price 1983).&lt;ref&gt;Price, P. W. 1983. Communities of specialists: vacant niches in ecological and evolutionary time. In Strong, D., Simberloff, D. and Abele, L. Eds.. Ecological Communities: Conceptual Issues and the Evidence. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Niches remain narrow or become narrower as the result of natural selection in order to enhance the chances of mating. This “mating theory of niche restriction” &lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1977. A non-competitive mechanism responsible for restricting niches.  Zoologischer Anzeiger 199, 164-172.&lt;/ref&gt; is supported by the observation that niches of asexual stages are often wider than those of sexually mature stages; that niches become narrower at the time of mating; and that microhabitats of sessile species and of species with small population sizes often are narrower than those of non-sessile species and of species with large population sizes.

== Niche segregation ==

# The random selection of niches in largely empty niche space will often automatically lead to segregation (this mechanism is of particular importance in the second paradigm).
# Niches are segregated due to interspecific competition (this mechanism is of particular importance in the first paradigm).
# Niches of similar species are segregated (as the result of natural selection) in order to prevent interspecific hybridisation, because hybrids are less fit. (Many cases of niche segregation explained by interspecific competition are better explained by this mechanism, i.e., “[[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement of reproductive barriers]]”) (e.g., Rohde 2005b).&lt;ref name="Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)"/&gt;

==Relative significance of the mechanisms==

Both paradigms acknowledge a role for all mechanisms (except possibly for that of random selection of niches in the first paradigm), but emphasis on the various mechanisms varies. The first paradigm stresses the paramount importance of interspecific competition, whereas the second paradigm tries to explain many cases which are thought to be due to competition in the first paradigm, by reinforcement of reproductive barriers and/or random selection of niches. – Many authors believe in the overriding importance of interspecific competition. Intuitively, one would expect that [[interspecific competition]] is of particular importance in all those cases in which sympatric species (i.e., species occurring together in the same area) with large population densities use the same resources and largely exhaust them. However, Andrewartha and Birch (1954,1984)&lt;ref&gt;Andrewartha,H.G. and Birch, L.C. 1954. The distribution and abundance of animals. University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrewartha, H.G. and Birch, L.C. 1984. The ecological web. University of Chicago Press. Chicago and London.&lt;/ref&gt; and others have pointed out that most natural populations usually don’t even approach exhaustion of resources, and too much emphasis on interspecific competition is therefore wrong. Concerning the possibility that competition has led to segregation in the evolutionary past, Wiens (1974, 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1974. Habitat heterogeneity and avian community structure in North American grasslands. American Midland Naturalist 91,195-213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1984. Resource systems, populations, and communities. In: Price, P.W., Slobodchikoff, C.N. and Gaud, W.S. Eds. A new ecology. Novel approaches to interactive systems. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, Chichester, Brisbane, Toronto, Singapore, pp. 397-436.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that such assumptions cannot be proven, and Connell (1980)&lt;ref&gt;Connell, J.H. 1980. Diversity and the coevolution of competitors, or the ghost of competition past. Oikos 35, 131-138.&lt;/ref&gt; found that interspecific competition as a mechanism of niche segregation has been proven only for some pest insects. Barker (1983),&lt;ref&gt;Barker, J.S.F. 1983. Interspecific competition. In: Ashburner, M., Carson, H.L. and Thompson, jr., J.N. Ed. The genetics and biology of Drosophila. Academic Press, London, pp. 285-341.&lt;/ref&gt; in his review of competition in ''Drosophila'' and related genera, which are among the best known animal groups, concluded that the idea of niche segregation by interspecific competition is attractive, but that no study has yet been able to show a mechanism responsible for segregation. Without specific evidence, the possibility of random segregation can never be excluded, and assumption of such randomness can indeed serve as a null-model. – Many physiological and morphological differences between species can prevent hybridization. Evidence for niche segregation as the result of reinforcement of reproductive barriers is especially convincing in those cases in which such differences are not found in allopatric but only in sympatric locations. For example, Kawano (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Kawano, K. 2002. Character displacement in giant rhinoceros beetles. American Naturalist 159, 255-271.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown this for giant rhinoceros beetles in Southeast Asia. Two closely related species occur in 12 allopatric (i.e., in different areas) and 7 sympatric (i.e., in the same area) locations. In the former, body length and length of genitalia are practically identical, in the latter, they are significantly different, and much more so for the genitalia than the body, convincing evidence that reinforcement is an important factor (and possibly the only one) responsible for niche segregation. - The very detailed studies of communities of Monogenea parasitic on the gills of marine and freshwater fishes by several authors have shown the same. Species use strictly defined microhabitats and have very complex copulatory organs.  This and the fact that fish replicas are available in almost unlimited numbers, makes them ideal ecological models.  Many congeners (species belonging to the same genus) and non-congeners were found on single host species. The maximum number of congeners was nine species. The only limiting factor is space for attachment, since food (blood, mucus, fast regenerating epithelial cells) is in unlimited supply as long as the fish is alive. Various authors, using a variety of statistical methods, have consistently found that species with different copulatory organs may co-occur in the same microhabitat, whereas congeners with identical or very similar copulatory organs are spatially segregated, convincing evidence that reinforcement and not competition is responsible for niche segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1991. Intra- and interspecific interactions in low density populations in resource-rich habitats.  Oikos 60, 91-104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1994. Niche restriction in parasites: proximate and ultimate causes. Parasitology 109, S69-S84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simkova, A., Desdevises,Y.,Gelnar,M. and Morand, S. (2000).

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to control engineering:

'''[[Control engineering]]''' &amp;ndash; engineering discipline that applies control theory to design systems with desired behaviors. The practice uses sensors to measure the output performance of the device being controlled and those measurements can be used to give feedback to the input actuators that can make corrections toward desired performance. When a device is designed to perform without the need of human inputs for correction it is called automatic control (such as cruise control for regulating a car's speed).

==History==

The Payson Center was founded in 1998 by [[William E. Bertrand]] and [[Eamon Kelly (academic administrator)|Eamon Kelly]] as the '''Payson School for International Development and Technology Transfer''', with a focus on [[information and communication technology]] in international development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payson.tulane.edu/history "History," Payson Center for International Development website] (accessed 21 April 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 2007 Payson maintained an office in [[Arlington, VA]].

In 2008 it was reorganized as part of the [[Tulane Law School]], which at the time was a unique affiliation. In 2014, the Center underwent another restructuring and no longer exists as a functioning entity.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7905">In [[linguistics]], especially within [[generative grammar]], '''phi features''' (denoted with the Greek letter [[Phi|φ]] 'phi') are the semantic features of [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]],  [[Grammatical gender|gender]], and [[Grammatical case|case]], as encoded in pronominal agreement with [[nouns]] and [[pronouns]] (the latter are said to consist only of phi-features, containing no lexical head). Several other features are included in the set of phi-features, such as the categorical features ±N (nominal) and ±V (verbal), which can be used to describe [[lexical category|lexical categories]] and case features.&lt;ref name="Kerstens, Johan"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cJagGHOlKDUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1 The syntax of number, person, and gender: a theory of phi-features], Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., 1993, p.2"&lt;/ref&gt;

Phi-features are often thought of as the "silent" features that exist on lexical heads (or, according to some theories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/885337994|title=The universal structure of categories : towards a formal typology|last=Martina,|first=Wiltschko,|isbn=9781316004159|location=Cambridge|oclc=885337994}}&lt;/ref&gt;, within the syntactic structure) that are understood for number, gender, person or reflexivity. Due to their silent nature, phi-features are often only understood if someone is a native speaker of a language, or if the translation includes a gloss of all these features. Many languages exhibit a [[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]] phenomenon which means that they rely on other lexical categories to determine the phi-features of the lexical heads.

In [[English language|English]], we rely on nouns to determine the phi-features of a word, but other languages rely on inflections of the different parts of speech to determine person, number and gender of the nominal phrases to which they refer. Mainly '''verbs''' and '''adjectives''' are responsible for bearing inflections which signal the phi-features of a particular subject or object. Verbs appear to be responsible for carrying the most features and tend to carry person, number and gender agreements cross-linguistically for both subjects and objects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511619830|title=The Syntax of Agreement and Concord|last=Baker|first=Mark C.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511619830|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Adjectives also carry phi-features in some languages, they tend to agree in number and gender but rarely for person &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511619830|title=The Syntax of Agreement and Concord|last=Baker|first=Mark C.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511619830|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Person ===
In English, person agreement is understood in the pronoun or noun overtly, while the verb carries the agreement marker to agree with the person phi-features on the Noun. For English, there is only one verb agreement required for the third person singular in the present tense (usually -s), as seen in the table '''Person Agreement for WALK: English'''.

|You (all) walk
|-
|'''3rd'''
|He/she/it '''''walks'''''
|They walk
|}
In a null-subject language such as [[Italian language|Italian]], however, subjects are not required (in fact, in many null subject languages, producing overt subjects is a sign of non-nativity). Therefore, Italian uses a different inflectional morphology for each pronominal that is based not the person features of the nominal subject it agrees with:

&lt;u&gt;- Camminare (''to walk''):&lt;/u&gt;
cammin'''o''' (''I walk)'', cammin'''iamo''' (''we walk'')

camm'''ini''' (''you walk''), cammin'''ate''' (''you all walk'')

cammi'''na''' (''he/she walks''), camm'''inano''' (''they walk'')
=== Number ===
In English, number agreement is not inflected on Verbs like they are in other languages. This is partly because English is a language that requires subjects and the subjects in English overtly express number. In English, number is a phi-feature that is understood on the noun. In terms of inflectional morphology, the most common in English is ''-s'' inflected on nouns that are plural:

- Duck'''s''', fridge'''s''', baseball'''s''', cup'''s''', book'''s''', mirror'''s''', car'''s''', building'''s''', clown'''s''', bridge'''s''', cream'''s'''....

Some cases of plurality in English require conjugation of the entire noun to express the phi-feature of plurality:

- M'''en''', wom'''en''', m'''ice''', t'''eeth'''....

Neither verbs nor adjectives are used to agree with the phi-features of the noun that they are agreeing with in English.
[[File:Feminine and Masculine inflections (singular) in Italian.png|alt=|thumb|419x419px|Bolded words are the inflected forms for gender in Italian.]]

=== Gender ===
English is a language that does not have gendered nominal phrases and pronouns (except in the case of proper names of nouns that are sentient beings who belong to a certain gender category) and does not have phi-feature agreement for gender. Many other languages of the world do have gendered nouns. [[German language|German]], for example, has three genders; feminine, masculine and neuter. Italian has two: feminine and masculine phi-features. For Italian, inflections on the '''adjectives''' and '''determiners''' are used for gender agreement within the pronominal phrase.

=== Case ===
Reflexivity is overt in English for every person:

my'''''self'',''' your'''''self'',''' him'''''self''''', your'''''selves''''', our'''''selves''''', them'''''selves'''''

In many languages, reflexivity is not overt for person. A prime example is apparent in [[French language|French]] ''se''. French ''se'' is used to express reflexivity for every expression of the third person. For this reason, some theories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Déchaine|first=Rose-Marie|last2=Wiltschko|first2=Martina|date=2017-03-23|title=A Formal Typology of Reflexives|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/10.1111/stul.12072|journal=Studia Linguistica|language=en|volume=71|issue=1-2|pages=60–106|doi=10.1111/stul.12072|issn=0039-3193}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that reflexive phi-features for languages such as French posit in a level on the syntactic structure that is silent, between the determiner and the noun.

'''Production equipment control''' involves production equipment that resides in the [[shop floor]] of a manufacturing company and its purpose is to produce goods of a wanted [[Quality (business)|quality]] when provided with [[production resource]]s of a required quality. In modern [[production line]]s the production equipment is fully automated using [[industrial control method]]s and involves limited [[unskilled labour]] participation. Modern production equipment consists of [[mechatronic]] modules that are integrated according to a [[control architecture]]. The most widely known architectures involve [[hierarchy]], [[polyarchy]], [[hetaerarchy]] and hybrid. The methods for achieving a [[technical effect]] are described by [[control algorithm]]s, which may or may not utilize [[formal method]]s in their design.

'''Prototype theory''' is a mode of graded [[categorization]] in [[cognitive science]], where some members of a category are more central than others.  For example, when asked to give an example of the concept ''furniture'', ''chair'' is more frequently cited than, say, ''stool''. Prototype theory has also been applied in [[linguistics]], as part of the mapping from [[phonology|phonological structure]] to [[semantics]].

==Overview==
As formulated in the 1970s by [[Eleanor Rosch]] and others{{Citation needed|reason=Which others?|date=August 2018}} , prototype theory was a radical departure from traditional necessary and sufficient conditions as in [[Aristotelian logic]], which led to
set-theoretic approaches of [[Extension (semantics)|extensional]] or [[intension]]al [[semantics]].  Thus instead of a [[definition]] based model—e.g. a bird may be defined as elements with the features [+feathers], [+beak] and [+ability to fly]—prototype theory would consider a category like bird as
consisting of different elements which have unequal status and, therefore, a ''robin'' is considered to be '''more''' prototypical of a ''bird'' than, say, a ''penguin'' (which, for instance) can't fly).  This leads to a graded notion of categories, which is a central notion in many models of [[cognitive science]] and [[cognitive semantics]], e.g. in the work of [[George Lakoff]] (''Women, Fire and Dangerous Things'', 1987) or [[Ronald Langacker]] (''Foundations of Cognitive Grammar'', vol. 1/2 1987/1991).

==Terminology==
The term ''prototype'', as defined in [[Eleanor Rosch]]'s study "Natural Categories" (1973), and was initially defined as denoting a stimulus, which takes a salient position in the formation of a category, due to the fact that it is the first stimulus to be associated with that category. Rosch later defined it as the most central member of a category.&lt;!-- Ways in which human beings deal cognitively with their perceptions of the world. --&gt;

==Categories==
In her 1975 paper, ''Cognitive Representation of Semantic Categories'' (J Experimental Psychology v. 104:192-233), Eleanor Rosch asked 200 American college students to rate, on a scale of 1 to 7, whether they regarded the following items as a good example of the category ''furniture''. This ranged from chair and sofa, ranked number 1, to a love seat (number 10), to a lamp (number 31), all the way to a telephone, ranked number 60.

While one may differ from this list in terms of cultural specifics, the point is that such a graded categorization is likely to be present in all cultures. Further evidence that some members of a category are more privileged than others came from experiments involving:

:1. ''Response Times'': in which queries involving a prototypical members (e.g. ''is a robin a bird'') elicited faster response times than for non-prototypical members.

:2. ''Priming'': When primed with the higher-level (superordinate) category, subjects were faster in identifying if two words are the same.  Thus, after flashing ''furniture'', the equivalence of ''chair-chair'' is detected more rapidly than ''stove-stove''.

:3. ''Exemplars'': When asked to name a few exemplars, the more prototypical items came up more frequently.

Subsequent to Rosch's work, prototype effects have been investigated widely in areas such as colour cognition ([[Brent Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay]], 1969), and also for more abstract notions.  Subjects may be asked, e.g. "to what degree is this narrative an instance of telling a lie?" [Coleman/Kay:1981].  Similarly work has been done on actions (verbs like look, kill, speak, walk [Pulman:83]), adjectives like "tall" [Dirven/Taylor:88], etc.

Another aspect in which Prototype Theory departs from traditional [[Aristotelian categorization]] is that there do not appear to be [[natural kind]] categories (bird, dog) vs. artifacts (toys, vehicles).

A common comparison is the use of prototype or the use of exemplars in category classification. Medin, Altom, and Murphy (1984) found that using a mixture of prototype and exemplar information, participants were more accurately able to judge categories. Participants who were presented with prototype values classified based on similarity to stored prototypes and stored exemplars, whereas participants who only had experience with exemplar only relied on the similarity to stored exemplars. Smith and Minda (2002) looked at the use of prototypes and exemplars in dot-pattern category learning. They found that participants used more prototypes than they used exemplars, with the prototypes being the center of the category, and exemplars surrounding it.

===Basic level categories===

The other notion related to prototypes is that of a ''basic level'' in cognitive categorization. When asked ''What are you sitting on?'', most subjects prefer to say chair rather than a subordinate such as ''kitchen chair'' or a superordinate such as ''furniture''.  Basic categories are relatively homogeneous in terms of sensory-motor [[affordance]]s — a chair is associated with bending of one's knees, a fruit with picking it up and putting it in your mouth, etc.  At the subordinate level (e.g. [dentist's chairs], [kitchen chairs] etc.) hardly any significant features can be added to that of the basic level; whereas at the superordinate level, these conceptual similarities are hard to pinpoint.  A picture of a chair is easy to draw (or visualize), but drawing furniture would be difficult.

Rosch (1978) defines the basic level as that level that has the highest degree of cue validity. Thus, a category like [animal] may have a prototypical member, but no cognitive visual representation.  On the other hand, basic categories in [animal], i.e. [dog], [bird], [fish], are full of informational content and can easily be categorized in terms of [[Gestaltism|Gestalt]] and semantic features.

Clearly semantic models based on attribute-value pairs fail to identify privileged levels in the hierarchy.  Functionally, it is thought that basic level categories are a decomposition of the world into maximally [[Information Theory|informative]] categories.  Thus, they
* maximize the number of attributes shared by members of the category, and
* minimize the number of attributes shared with other categories

However, the notion of Basic Level is problematic, e.g. whereas dog as a basic category is a species, bird or fish are at a higher level, etc.  Similarly, the notion of frequency is very closely tied to the basic level, but is hard to pinpoint.

More problems arise when the notion of a prototype is applied to lexical categories other than the noun. Verbs, for example, seem to defy a clear prototype: [to run] is hard to split up in more or less central members.

===Prototype and category formation and autism===
[[Autism]] has been shown to affect category and prototype formation. Gastgeb, Dundas, Minshew, and Strauss (2011) found that adults with high-functioning autism had difficulty forming categories and prototypes for dot patterns. Compared to those without autism, the pattern of results was the same, but overall performance of the autism groups was significantly lower.

Individuals with autism have also been shown to have differences in the formation of prototypes for faces. Gatsgeb, Wilkinson, Minshew, and Strauss (2011), in a separate study from the above, found that adults with high-functioning autism have significant difficulty in forming prototypes for faces. After shown a series of faces based on prototypes faces, those with autism had a harder time identifying the prototype faces than those without autism.

Children with autism also show prototype effects. Molesworth, Bowler, and Hampton (2008) found that two-thirds of their sample of autistic children with high-functioning autism did not show diminished prototype effects, while one-third showed no prototype effects. Molesworth, Bowler, and Hampton (2005) found signs of the prototype effect is children with autism and [[Asperger syndrome]] showed signs of prototype effects, yet the effects were not diminished from children without autism or Asperger syndrome.

==Distance between concepts==
The notion of prototypes is related to [[Wittgenstein]]'s (later) discomfort with the traditional notion of category. This influential theory has resulted in a view of semantic components more as ''possible'' rather than necessary contributors to the meaning of texts.  His discussion on the category ''game'' is particularly incisive (Philosophical Investigations 66, 1953):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
   Consider for example the proceedings that we call 'games'. I mean board games,
   card games, ball games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all?
   Don't say, "There must be something common, or they would not be called
   'games'"--but look and see whether there is anything common to all. For if
   you look at them you will not see something common to all, but similarities,
   relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: don't think,
   but look! Look for example at board games, with their multifarious
   relationships. Now pass to card games; here you find many correspondences
   with the first group, but many common features drop out, and others appear.
   When we pass next to ball games, much that is common is retained, but much
   is lost. Are they all 'amusing'? Compare chess with noughts and crosses. Or
   is there always winning and losing, or competition between players? Think of
   patience. In ball games there is winning and losing; but when a child throws
   his ball at the wall and catches it again, this feature has disappeared. Look
   at the parts played by skill and luck; and at the difference between skill in
   chess and skill in tennis. Think now of games like ring-a-ring-a-roses; here
   is the element of amusement, but how many other characteristic features have
   disappeared! And we can go through the many, many other groups of games in the
   same way; can see how similarities crop up and disappear. And the result of
   this examination is: we see a complicated network of similarities overlapping
   and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of
   detail.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clearly, the notion of
''[[family resemblance]]'' is calling for a notion of conceptual distance, which is closely related to the idea of graded sets, but there are problems as well.

Recently, [[Peter Gärdenfors]] ([[#Gardenfors2004|2004]]) has elaborated a possible partial explanation of prototype theory in terms of multi-dimensional feature spaces called [[conceptual space]]s, where a category is defined in terms of a conceptual distance. More central members of a category are "between" the peripheral members. He postulates that most ''natural'' categories exhibit a convexity in conceptual space, in that if x and y are elements of a category, and if z is ''between'' x and y, then z is also likely to belong to the category.

However, in the notion of game above, is there a single prototype or several? Recent linguistic data from colour studies seem to indicate that categories may have more than one focal element—e.g. the [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]] colour term ''rihlaza'' refers to a green-blue continuum, but appears to have two prototypes, a focal blue, and a focal green. Thus, it is possible to have single categories with multiple, disconnected, prototypes, in which case they may constitute the union of several convex sets rather than a single one.

==Combining categories==
All around us, we find instances where objects like ''tall man'' or ''small elephant'' combine one or more categories. This was a problem for extensional semantics, where the semantics of a word such as ''red'' is to be defined as the set of objects having this property. Clearly, this does not apply so well to modifiers such as ''small''; a ''small mouse'' is very different from a ''small elephant''.

These combinations pose a lesser problem in terms of prototype theory. In situations involving adjectives (e.g. ''tall''), one encounters the question of whether or not the prototype of [tall] is a 6 foot tall man, or a 400-foot skyscraper [Dirven and Taylor 1988]. The solution emerges by contextualizing the notion of prototype in terms of the object being modified. This extends even more radically in compounds such as ''red wine'' or ''red hair'' which are hardly ''red'' in the prototypical sense, but the red indicates merely a shift from the prototypical colour of wine or hair respectively. This corresponds to [[de Saussure]]'s notion of concepts as purely differential: "non pas positivement par leur contenu, mais negativement par leurs rapports avec les autres termes du systeme" [p.&amp;nbsp;162; not positively, in terms of their content, but negatively by contrast with other terms in the same system (tr. Harris 83)].

Other problems remain—e.g. in determining which of the constituent categories will contribute which feature?  In the example of a "pet bird" [Hampton 97], ''pet'' provides the habitat of the compound (cage rather than the wild), whereas ''bird'' provides the skin type (feathers rather than fur).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13960">'''Radiation materials science''' describes the interaction of radiation with [[matter]]: a broad subject covering many forms of [[irradiation]] and of matter.

==Main aim of radiation material science==
Some of the most profound effects of [[irradiation]] on materials occur in the core of [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear power reactors]] where atoms comprising the structural components are displaced numerous times over the course of their engineering lifetimes. The consequences of radiation to core components includes changes in [[shape]] and [[volume]] by tens of percent, increases in [[hardness]] by factors of five or more, severe reduction in [[ductility]] and increased [[embrittlement]], and susceptibility to environmentally induced cracking. For these structures to fulfill their purpose, a firm understanding of the effect of radiation on materials is required in order to account for irradiation effects in design, to mitigate its effect by changing operating conditions, or to serve as a guide for creating new, more radiation-tolerant materials that can better serve their purpose.

== Radiation ==
{{Main|Radiation}}
The types of radiation that can alter structural materials consist of [[Neutron radiation|neutrons]], [[Ionizing radiation|ions]], [[electrons]] and [[gamma rays]]. All of these forms of radiation have the capability to displace atoms from their lattice sites, which is the fundamental process that drives the changes in structural metals.The inclusion of ions among the irradiating particles provides a tie-in to other fields and disciplines such as the use of [[Particle accelerator|accelerators]] for the [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of [[Radioactive waste|nuclear waste]], or in the creation of new materials by [[ion implantation]], [[ion beam mixing]], [[Plasma-immersion ion implantation|plasma assisted ion implantation]] and [[Ion beam deposition|ion beam assisted deposition]].

The effect of irradiation on materials is rooted in the initial event in which an energetic projectile strikes a target. While the event is made up of several steps or processes, the primary result is the [[single displacement reaction|displacement]] of an atom from its lattice site. [[Irradiation]] displaces an atom from its site, leaving a vacant site behind (a [[Vacancy defect|vacancy]]) and the displaced atom eventually comes to rest in a location that is between lattice sites, becoming an [[Interstitial defect|interstitial]] atom. The vacancy-interstitial pair is central to radiation effects in crystalline solids and is known as a [[Frenkel pair]] (FP). The presence of the Frenkel pair and other consequences of irradiation damage determine the physical effects, and with the application of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]], the mechanical effects of irradiation by the occurring of interstitial, phenomena, such as [[Neutron-induced swelling|swelling]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[phase transition]], [[Segregation in materials|segregation]], etc., will be effected. In addition to the atomic displacement, an energetic charged particle moving in a lattice also gives energy to electrons in the system, via the [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|electronic stopping power]]. This energy transfer can also for high-energy particles produce damage in non-metallic materials, as so called [[ion tracks]].&lt;ref name="Mef94"&gt;

== Radiation damage ==
{{main|Radiation damage}}
The radiation damage event is defined as the transfer of energy from an incident projectile to the solid and the resulting distribution of target atoms after completion of the event. This event is composed of several distinct processes:
# The interaction of an energetic incident particle with a lattice atom
# The transfer of [[kinetic energy]] to the lattice atom giving birth to a [[primary knock-on atom]] (PKA)
# The displacement of the atom from its lattice site
# The passage of the displaced atom through the lattice and the accompanying creation of additional knock-on atoms
# The production of a [[collision cascade|displacement cascade]] (collection of point defects created by the PKA)
# The termination of the PKA as an interstitial

The result of a radiation damage event is, if the energy given to a lattice atom is above the [[threshold displacement energy]],  the creation of a collection of [[Crystallographic defect#Point defects|point defects]] (vacancies and interstitials) and clusters of these defects in the crystal lattice.

The essence of the quantification of radiation damage in solids is the number of displacements per unit volume per unit time &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; :
:&lt;math&gt; R = N \int_{E_{min}}^{E_{max}} \int_{T_{min}}^{T_{max}} \phi(E_i)\,\sigma(E_i,T)\,\upsilon(T)\,dT\,dE_i. &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the atom number density, &lt;math&gt;E_{max}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{min}&lt;/math&gt; are the maximum and minimum energies of the incoming particle, &lt;math&gt;\phi(E_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the energy dependent particle flux, &lt;math&gt;T_{max}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{min}&lt;/math&gt; are the maximum and minimum energies transferred in a collision of a particle of energy &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; and a lattice atom, &lt;math&gt;\sigma(E_i,T)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]] for the collision of a particle of energy &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; that results in a transfer of energy &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; to the struck atom, &lt;math&gt;\upsilon(T)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of displacements per primary knock-on atom.

The two key variables in this equation are &lt;math&gt;\sigma(E_i,T)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\upsilon(T)&lt;/math&gt;. The term &lt;math&gt;\sigma(E_i,T)&lt;/math&gt; describes the transfer of energy from the incoming particle to the first atom it encounters in the target, the primary knock-on atom (PKA); The second quantity &lt;math&gt;\upsilon(T)&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of displacements that the PKA goes on to make in the solid; Taken together, they describe the total number of displacements caused by an incoming particle of energy &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the above equation accounts for the energy distribution of the incoming particles. The result is the total number of displacements in the target from a flux of particles with a known energy distribution.

In radiation material Science the displacement damage in the alloy ( &lt;math&gt;\left[ dpa \right]&lt;/math&gt; = '''displacements per atom in the solid''' ) is a better representation of the effect of irradiation on materials properties than the fluence ( neutron fluence, &lt;math&gt;\left[ MeV \right]&lt;/math&gt; ).

== Radiation resistant materials ==
To generate materials that fit the increasing demands of nuclear reactors to operate with higher efficiency or for longer lifetimes, materials must be designed with radiation resistance in mind. In particular, [[Nuclear reactor|Generation IV nuclear reactors]] operate at higher temperatures and pressures compared to modern [[pressurized water reactor]]s, which account for a vast amount of western reactors. This leads to increased vulnerability to normal mechanical failure in terms of [[Creep (deformation)|creep resistance]] as well as radiation damaging events such as [[neutron-induced swelling]] and [[Segregation in materials|radiation induced segregation of phases]]. By accounting for radiation damage, reactor materials would be able to withstand longer operating lifetimes. This allows reactors to be decommissioned after longer periods of time, improving return on investment of reactors without compromising safety. This is of particular interest in developing commercial viability of advanced and theoretical nuclear reactors, and this goal can be accomplished through engineering resistance to these displacement events.

=== Grain boundary engineering ===
[[Cubic crystal system|Face centered cubic]] (FCC) metals such as austenitic steels and Ni-base alloys can benefit greatly from grain boundary engineering. Grain boundary engineering attempts to generate higher amounts of special grain boundaries, characterized by favorable orientations between grains. By increasing populations of low energy boundaries without increasing grain size, fracture mechanics of these FCC metals can be changed to improve mechanical properties given a similar displacements per atom (DPA) value versus non grain boundary engineered alloys. This method of treatment in particular yields better resistance to [[stress corrosion cracking]] and oxidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Grain boundary engineering for structure materials of nuclear reactors|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022311513005539|journal = Journal of Nuclear Materials|date = 2013-10-01|pages = 661–666|volume = 441|issue = 1–3|doi = 10.1016/j.jnucmat.2013.03.050|first = L.|last = Tan|first2 = T. R.|last2 = Allen|first3 = J. T.|last3 = Busby|bibcode = 2013JNuM..441..661T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materials selection ===
By using advanced methods of [[material selection]], materials can be judged on criteria such as neutron-absorption cross sectional area. Selecting materials with minimum neutron-absorption can heavily minimize the number of DPA that occur over a reactor material's lifetime. This slows the radiation embrittlement process by preventing mobility of atoms in the first place, proactively selecting materials that do not interact with the nuclear radiation as frequently. This can have a huge impact on total damage especially when comparing the materials of modern advanced reactors of zirconium to stainless steel reactor cores, which can differ in absorption cross section by an order of magnitude from more optimal materials.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, M.F. and Michael Smidman.

=== Short range order (SRO) self-organization ===
For nickel-chromium and iron-chromium alloys, short range order can be designed on the nano-scale (&lt;5&amp;nbsp;nm) that absorbs the interstitial and vacancy's generated by PKA events. This allows materials that mitigate the swelling that normally occurs in the presence of high DPAs and keep the overall volume percent change under the ten percent range. This occurs through generating a metastable phase that is in constant, dynamic equilibrium with surrounding material. This metastable phase is characterized by having an enthalpy of mixing that is effectively zero with respect to the main lattice. This allows phase transformation to absorb and disperse the point defects that typically accumulate in more rigid lattices. This extends the life of the alloy through making vacancy and interstitial creation less successful as constant neutron excitement in the form of displacement cascades transform the SRO phase, while the SRO reforms in the bulk solid solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Self-organization of a nanocrystalline structure in transition-metal alloys under the action of temperature and irradiation as a basis for designing radiation-resistant structural materials for nuclear reactors|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0036029510030092|journal = Russian Metallurgy (Metally)|date = 2010-07-20|issn = 0036-0295|pages = 197–206|volume = 2010|issue = 3|doi = 10.1134/S0036029510030092|first = V.

'''Roger Parker''' (born [[London]] [[United Kingdom]], 2 August 1951) is an English [[musicologist]] and, since January 2007, has been [[Thurston Dart]] Professor of Music at [[King's College London]].&lt;ref name=BIO2&gt;https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/roger.parker.html&lt;/ref&gt;
His work has centred on [[opera]]. Between 2006 and 2010, while Professor of Music at [[Gresham College]], London, Parker presented four series of free public lectures, one example being "Verdi and Milan" in 2007 which is available on video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/verdi-and-milan|title=Verdi and Milan|work=gresham.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to teaching, Parker has been active as joint editor in the preparation of [[Critical edition (opera)|critical editions]] of the work of 19th-century Italian composer [[Gaetano Donizetti]] for the Milan publishing house [[Casa Ricordi|Ricordi]].&lt;ref name=DONIZ/&gt;  He also acts as Repertory Consultant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opera-rara.com/profile/news/read/id/38/|title=Charles Alexander - Chairman|work=opera-rara.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the UK's specialised recording company, [[Opera Rara]], which has commissioned performances and recordings of rare Donizetti operas such as ''[[Belisario]]'' in 2012 and ''[[Les Martyrs]]'' in 2014.&lt;ref name=BIO/&gt; Additionally, Parker has presented talks on UK radio on aspects of opera, including his talk  "Verdi 200: Viva Verdi"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pmf8c|title=BBC Radio 3 - Sunday Feature, Verdi 200: Viva Verdi|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[BBC radio 3]] on 6 January and 13 October 2013.

==Education and academic work==
He studied at the [[University of London]], first at [[Goldsmiths' College]], and then at [[King's College London]] from which he obtained his PhD in 1981. In 1982, he moved to [[Cornell University]] in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]], where he was assistant professor and then associate professor. Returning to England to become a lecturer in music (later professor) and fellow of [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], in 1999 he became professor of music at [[Cambridge University]], where he was a fellow of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]]. Between 2005 and 2006, he was the chair of the School of Arts and Humanities. Parker became the Visiting [[Ernest Bloch]] Lecturer at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 2002 and, in 2007, he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].

==Preparation of critical editions of operas==
Roger Parker's focus has been in the area of Italian opera of the nineteenth century. For ten years he was founding co-editor (with Arthur Groos) of the ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', and he continues as General [[editing|Editor]] of ''The [[Critical edition (opera)|Critical Edition]] of the Operas of Gaetano Donizetti'' published it Italy by [[Casa Ricordi]] of [[Milan]] and in the United States by the University of Chicago Press under the auspices of the Fondazione Donizetti. His co-editor is Gabriele Dotto, who led Ricordi's editorial department from 1992 to 2001.&lt;ref name=DONIZ&gt;http://www.ricordi.it/cms/critical-editions/gaetano-donizetti&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donizetti.org/index.php?catid=23&amp;blogid=4|title=Fondazione Donizetti Bergamo - Fondazione Donizetti Bergamo|work=donizetti.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221224646/http://www.donizetti.org/index.php?catid=23&amp;blogid=4|archivedate=2014-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critical editions of Donizetti's operas on which Parker has worked include ''[[Linda di Chamounix]]'' in 2007&lt;ref&gt;http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/L/bo5814116.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those titles which appear on the Donizetti Society's list of works completed by Parker alone, such as ''[[Lucrezia Borgia]]'' (1998) and ''[[Adelia]]''.  Additionally, along with Dotto, he has co-authored the critical edition of ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' which was presented at the [[Royal Opera House]], London in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donizettisociety.com/scores.htm#Critical|title=Donizetti Society Scores and Librettos Page|work=donizettisociety.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Parker is also credited as editor of the critical edition of [[Puccini]]'s opera, ''[[Manon Lescaut]]'' published by Ricordi in 2013.

A major revival&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/arts/16iht-loomis16.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; of a never-completed Donizetti opera, ''[[Le duc d'Albe]]'', was given in 2012 by the [[Vlaamse Opera]] from a critical edition prepared by Parker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/action/ArtsHums/Finishing-the-job-Kings-academic-completes-Donizetti-opera.aspx|title=King's College London -  Finishing the job: King's academic completes Donizetti opera|work=kcl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has written about the work involved in its preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donizettisociety.com/Articles/articleleduc.htm|title=Donizetti Society  Article - Le Duc d'Albe|work=donizettisociety.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement with performances==
For the preparation, recording, and presentation of the Opera Rara recording of Donizetti's ''Belisario'' in 2012, it has been noted that the opera was "performed in the edition by Sir Mark Elder, Roger Parker and Jurgen Selk, based on the 2010 edition by [[Ottavio Sbragia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalsource.com/db_control/db_concert_review.php?id=10568|title=Donizetti's Belisario – BBCSO/Mark Elder and Opera Rara [Nicola Alaimo, Joyce El-Khoury, Russell Thomas &amp; Camilla Roberts] @www.classicalsource.com|work=classicalsource.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that event, Parker coordinated and presented an afternoon-long public symposium on the opera. In a similar fashion, when Donizetti's ''Les Martyrs'' was presented by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in London in November 2014, Roger Parker was part of an introductory panel which also included Dr Flora Willson (who prepared the critical edition) and author and Donizetti biographer [[Jonathan Keates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oae.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Les-Martyrs-Programme.pdf|format=PDF|title=Programme for ''Les Maryrs''|website=oae.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and appointments==
He received the "Premio Giuseppe Verdi" in 1986, was a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]] Fellow in 1986–87, and in 1991 was awarded the [[Dent May|Dent]] Medal of the [[Royal Musical Association]]. 2008 saw his election as [[Fellow of the British Academy]],&lt;ref name=BIO/&gt; while, in 2014, he was appointed member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]].

It has had a significant impact on collective responses to [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault]] in Western academic [[science]].

Published in 2014 by a team of [[Anthropologist|anthropologists]], [[Kathryn B. H. Clancy]], Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and [[Katie Hinde]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.

Second, women are more likely to be harassed by senior staff, while men are harassed by their peers. Third, the majority of field scientists do not know how to report harassment.

== Methods ==
The study included responses from 666 field scientists (77.5% were women and 85.9% of participants identified as heterosexual). The survey was conducted in two waves. The first wave ran from February 21 to April 12, 2013, and captured responses from biological anthropologists.  The second wave, running from April 13 to May 10, collected responses from scientists in other disciplines. A further 26 interviews were completed to explore more in-depth experiences of sexual harassment in a broad range of fieldwork sites. The respondents were asked about experiences had at any time during their career.

The survey was not designed to estimate the prevalence of sexual harassment or assault at field sites. It was conducted online and offered anonymity, suggesting a potential [[self-selection bias]]. Only two questions in the survey directly queried the behavior experienced by respondents:

:32. Have you ever personally experienced inappropriate or sexual remarks, comments about physical beauty, cognitive sex differences, or other jokes, at an anthropological field site?

:39. Have you ever experienced physical sexual harassment, unwanted sexual contact, or sexual contact in which you could not or did not give consent or felt it would be unsafe to fight back or not give your consent at an anthropological field site?

An affirmative response to question 32 was counted as a report of sexual harassment, while an affirmative response to question 39 was counted as sexual assault, including rape.

== Findings ==
Almost three-quarters of participants (72.4%) had directly observed or been told about inappropriate behaviour or sexual comments during fieldwork. Around two-thirds of participants (64%) had personally experienced sexual language in the field and 20% of participants had experienced unwanted sexual contact. The study presented these findings as reports of "sexual harassment" and "sexual assault" respectively, though respondents were not asked whether they had been sexually harassed or assaulted. Following conventions in this area of scholarship, the study counted all "sexual remarks" as sexual harassment and all "unwanted sexual contact" as sexual assault.  

The majority of people who experienced sexual harassment and assault were students and postdoctoral candidates. Perpetrators vary according to their target's gender: women are more likely to be harassed by superiors (senior people who have authority over them), while men are more likely to be harassed by their peers. Few people were sexually harassed by local members of the public, and instead the harassment occurred between colleagues in the field.

The SAFE13 study identifies several areas of improvement in combating sexual harassment in the field. For example, only around one-third of field scientists (37.7%) recalled a code of conduct operating at their fieldwork site, and less than one-quarter remembered there being anti-harassment policies. Amongst respondents who had experienced sexual harassment or assault, only one-fifth of survivors (20% each of women and men) knew of an easy way to formally report this experience. Amongst the small minority of people who did report sexual harassment and assault, less than 20% were satisfied with the outcome. The study therefore contributes to a body of empirical studies showing workplace sexual harassment negatively impacts on personal safety and professional productivity. In particular, the study shines attention on the role of fieldwork site directors in establishing clear rules to discourage sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/567418|title=News Bureau {{!}} ILLINOIS|last=Yates|first=Diana|website=news.illinois.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SAFE2 ==
In 2017, the qualitative findings of SAFE13 were published. Authored by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy, the study focused on the experiences of 26 interviewees, who were mostly anthropologists or [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] (23 of 26 interviewees), women (23 of 26), and white (21 of 26).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Robin G.|last2=Rutherford|first2=Julienne N.|last3=Hinde|first3=Katie|last4=Clancy|first4=Kathryn B. H.|date=2017-12-01|title=Signaling Safety: Characterizing Fieldwork Experiences and Their Implications for Career Trajectories|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aman.12929/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=119|issue=4|pages=710–722|doi=10.1111/aman.12929|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some participants described incidents of sexual harassment in multiple fieldwork sites, so fifty-four field contexts are represented in their narratives. Twelve participants recalled working at field sites with clear anti-harassment rules (representing 18 fieldwork sites). These sites had training, explicit conversations, and senior researchers modelled proactive behaviour to redress sexual harassment. Actively enforced anti-harassment policies were associated with positive fieldwork experiences where scientists felt safe, valued and equal. These sites were categorised by the researchers as "green" contexts where best practice was enforced by senior members of the research team. As a result there were fewer negative experiences, and transgressions were acted upon by leaders.

The rest of the participants described ambiguity or lack of clarity about codes of conduct. Even if they had some rules, sexual harassment still took place because were no consequences. Ambiguity led to repercussions for scientists who resisted sexual coercion, such as being alienated from colleagues and being denied professional opportunities. Harassment and negative fieldwork experiences also led to negative letters of employment, strained workplace relationships, career stalling, being forced to move to another site, or leaving their careers. The hostility would be continued into the future in other contexts, such as at conferences. Some participants were discouraged or prevented from taking formal reporting action by administrators. The researchers call ambiguous sites "yellow" contexts because if there was a vague set of rules, they were not consistently applied. "Red" contexts are fieldwork sites where there is both an absence of rules and consequences. 

SAFE2 and SAFE13 are recognised as having led to concrete institutional and policy changes in academic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic and public impact ==
Prior to its final publication, the evolving findings of the SAFE13 study received media coverage in 2013, with a focus on how sexual harassment creates a "chilly climate" in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/safe13-field-site-chilly-climate-and-abuse/|title=I had no power to say that's not okay: Reports of harassment and abuse in the field|last=Clancy|first=Kate|date=|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-03-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public discussion of the evolving study's findings explored the negative impact of harassment on junior women researchers. Media articles focused on fear of professional retribution if scientists report sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/17/young-scientists-face-rampant-sexual-harassment-in-the-field/|title=Study: Young female scientists face sexual harassment, assault while in the field|last=Hogan|first=Caelainn|date=2014-07-17|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other science publishers discussed the sense of powerless that both victims and bystanders face as harassment goes unpunished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/04/survey-finds-sexual-harassment-anthropology|title=Survey Finds Sexual Harassment in Anthropology|date=2013-04-13|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the final report was published, the study became widely cited as evidence that sexual harassment contributes to women leaving science careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmonds|first=Anna|title=Many women scientists sexually harassed during fieldwork|url=https://www.nature.com/news/many-women-scientists-sexually-harassed-during-fieldwork-1.15571|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional scientific societies publicly responded that, beyond making principal researchers responsible for reporting sexual harassment, institutional responses were additionally required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/16/sexual-assault-harassment-science-fieldwork-studies-research-study/12735343/|title=Sex assaults, harassment reported in science fieldwork|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The SAFE13 study inspired women scientists in other fields to conduct similar surveys into sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gewin|first=Virginia|date=2015-03-11|title=Social behaviour: Indecent advances|url=https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7542-251a|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=519|issue=7542|pages=251–253|doi=10.1038/nj7542-251a}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also paved the way for larger institutional surveys on harassment by professional societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201512/astronomy.cfm|title=Astronomy Allies Team Up to Confront Sexual Harassment|website=www.aps.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAFE13 study is referenced in high-profile cases, to contextualise the institutional dynamics that enable harassment to continue over many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-end-sexual-harassment-in-astronomy1/|title=How to End Sexual Harassment in Astronomy|last=Urry|first=Meg|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study has had a major impact on American [[astronomy]] and [[physics]] in particular, as these disciplines increasingly grapple with public incidents of harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/30/us/astronomy-sexual-harassment/index.html|title=Sexual harassment in STEM: 'It's tragic'|last=CNN|first=Sara Ganim,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, USA Rep. [[Jackie Speier]] of California sponsored a bill to compel research institutions to report investigations of harassment as a condition of receiving federal grant money. She cited the SAFE13 study as one piece of evidence informing the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://speier.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congresswoman-jackie-speier-introduces-bill-stop-rampant-sexual-abuse|title=Congresswoman Jackie Speier Introduces Bill to Stop Rampant Sexual Abuse, Harassment in STEM Research|date=2016-09-21|work=Congresswoman Jackie Speier|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also referred to SAFE13 in media interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/jackie-speier-sexual-harassment-science/|title=Rep Jackie Speier on Why She's Taking on Sexual Harassment in Science|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, the USA [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) announced it would require institutions to report whenever a researcher who is funded by their grants has engaged in sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/issuances/in144.jsp|title=Important Notice No. 144: Harassment (in144) {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSF also expects institutions they fund to provide a harassment-free workplace. The NSF Office of Diversity and Inclusion will additionally provide policies and resources to support this aim, and create an anonymous reporting system to receive direct reports of sexual harassment. The NSF is one of various science agencies under pressure by the [[United States Congress|USA Congress]] to counter sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witze|first=Alexandra|date=2018-02-08|title=US science agency will require universities to report sexual harassment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01744-5|journal=Nature|language=EN|volume=554|issue=7692|pages=287–288|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-01744-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a major cultural change in scientific science since the SAFE13 study first recommended a review of institutional responses to harassment.

On 27 February 2018, lead researcher of the SAFE13 study, Kathryn (Kate) Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-research-and-technology-hearing-review-sexual-harassment-and|title=Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing - A Review of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Science|date=2018-02-27|work=Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing identified a need to redress sexual harassment in science as a way to boost opportunities in science. Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kateclancy.com/transcript-of-my-oral-testimony-from-february-27th-congressional-hearing-on-sexual-misconduct-in-the-sciences/|title=Transcript of my oral testimony from February 27th Congressional hearing on sexual misconduct in the sciences {{!}} Context &amp; Variation|website=kateclancy.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five years after its preliminary findings were released, the SAFE13 study continues to be referenced in various media articles exploring how victims of sexual harassment are punished when they report harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAFE13 has also been cited as an important resource in responding to the aftermath of the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] movement in 2017, by providing systematic context of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/what-happens-now-studies-of-sexual-harassment-show-the-way/|title=What Happens Now?

Since 2013, scientists have consistently used the hashtag #SAFE13 in connection to other research on sexual harassment, as well as to discuss media reports and investigations on sexual harassment in science and academia, and to share personal experiences of harassment in academic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://breakingbio.com/2014/10/07/breaking-bio-episode-68-safe13-with-drs-clancy-nelson-rutherford-hinde/|title="Breaking Bio Episode 68 – #SAFE13 with Drs.

Part of the [[Simulacra and Simulation|three order simulacra]], the '''second-order simulacra''', a term coined by [[Jean Baudrillard]], are [[symbol]]s of a non faithful representation to the original. Here, signs and images do not faithfully show us reality, but might hint at the existence of something real which the sign itself is incapable of encapsulating.&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard 1994 [1981], Simulacra and Simulation, University of Michigan Press, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

While the first-order simulacra is a faithful copy to the original and the third order are symbols that have become without referents, that is, symbols with no real object to represent but pretends to be a faithful copy of an original. Simply put, a third-order simulacra are symbols in themselves taken for reality and further layer of [[symbol]]ism is added. This occurs when the symbol is taken to be more important or authoritative of the original entity, authenticity has been replaced by copy (thus reality is replaced by a substitute).

The consequence of the propagation of second-order [[simulacra]] is that, within the affected context, nothing is "real," though those engaged in the illusion are incapable of seeing it. Instead of having experiences, people observe spectacles, via real or [[metaphor]]ical control screens. Instead of the real, we have simulation and simulacra, the [[Hyperreality|hyperreal]].

In his essay "The Precession of the Simulacra," Baudrillard recalls a tale from a short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]] in which a king requests a map (i.e. a symbol) to be produced so detailed that it ends up coming into one-to-one correspondence with the territory (i.e. the real area the map is to represent); this references the philosophical concept of [[map–territory relation]]. Baudrillard argues that in the [[postmodern]] epoch, the territory ceases to exist, and there is nothing left but the map; or indeed, the very concepts of the map and the territory have become indistinguishable, the distinction which once existed between them having been erased.

Among the many issues associated with the propagation of second-order simulacra to the third-order is what Baudrillard considers the termination of history. The method of this termination comes through the lack of oppositional elements in society, with the mass having become "the [[silent majority]]," an imploded concept which absorbs images passively, becoming itself a media overwritten by those who speak for it (i.e. the people are symbolically represented by governing agents and market statistic, marginalizing the people themselves). For Baudrillard this is the natural result of an ethic of unity in which actually agonistic opposites are taken to be essentially the same. For example, Baudrillard contends that [[moral universalism]] (human rights, equality) is equated with [[globalization]], which is not concerned with immutable values but with mediums of exchange and equalisation such as the global market and [[mass media]].

The '''soil food web''' is the community of organisms living all or part of their lives in the soil. It describes a complex living system in the soil and how it interacts with the environment, plants, and animals.

[[Food webs]] describe the transfer of energy between species in an [[ecosystem]].  While a [[food chain]] examines one, linear, energy pathway through an ecosystem, a food web is more complex and illustrates all of the potential pathways. Much of this transferred energy comes from the sun. Plants use the sun’s energy to convert [[inorganic compound]]s into energy-rich, [[organic compound]]s, turning carbon dioxide and minerals into plant material by [[photosynthesis]]. Plant flowers [[Exudate#Plant exudates|exude]] energy-rich [[nectar]] above ground and plant roots exude acids, sugars, and ectoenzymes into the [[rhizosphere]], adjusting the [[pH]] and feeding the food web underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mineral Nutrition of Higher Plants |last1= Marschner|first1=Horst |year= 1995  |isbn=978-0124735439 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Walker | first1 = T.

Plants are called [[autotroph]]s because they make their own energy; they are also called producers because they produce energy available for other organisms to eat. [[Heterotroph]]s are consumers that cannot make their own food. In order to obtain energy they eat plants or other heterotrophs.

== Above ground food webs ==

In above ground food webs, energy moves from producers (plants) to primary consumers ([[herbivore]]s) and then to secondary consumers (predators). The phrase, [[trophic level]], refers to the different levels or steps in the energy pathway. In other words, the producers, consumers, and decomposers are the main trophic levels. This chain of energy transferring from one species to another can continue several more times, but eventually ends. At the end of the food chain, decomposers such as bacteria and fungi break down dead plant and animal material into simple nutrients.

== Methodology ==
The nature of soil makes direct observation of food webs difficult. Since soil organisms range in size from less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm (nematodes) to greater than 2&amp;nbsp;mm (earthworms) there are many different ways to extract them. Soil samples are often taken using a metal core. Larger macrofauna such as [[earthworm]]s and insect [[larva]] can be removed by hand, but this is impossible for smaller nematodes and soil arthropods. Most methods to extract small organisms are dynamic; they depend on the ability of the organisms to move out of the soil. For example, a [[Antonio Berlese|Berlese funnel]], used to collect small [[arthropod]]s, creates a light/heat gradient in the soil sample. As the microarthropods move down, away from the light and heat, they fall through a funnel and into a collection vial. A similar method, the Baermann funnel, is used for nematodes. The Baerman funnel is wet, however (while the Berlese funnel is dry) and does not depend on a light/heat gradient. Nematodes move out of the soil and to the bottom of the funnel because, as they move, they are denser than water and are unable to swim. Soil microbial communities are characterized in many different ways. The activity of microbes can be measured by their respiration and carbon dioxide release. The cellular components of microbes can be extracted from soil and genetically profiled, or microbial biomass can be calculated by weighing the soil before and after fumigation.

== Types of food webs ==
[[File:Indirect interaction.png|thumb|right|An example of a soil interaction web. Image courtesy of Kalessin11.]]

There are three different types of food web representations: topological (or traditional) food webs, flow webs and interaction webs. These webs can describe systems both above and below ground.

=== Topological webs ===
Early food webs were topological; they were descriptive and provided a nonquantitative picture of consumers, resources and the links between them. Pimm ''et al.'' (1991) described these webs as a map of which organisms in a community eat which other kinds. The earliest topological food web, made in 1912, examined the predators and parasites of cotton [[boll weevil]] (reviewed by Pimm ''et al.'' 1991). Researchers analyzed and compared topological webs between ecosystems by measuring the web’s interaction chain lengths and connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |year=1991 |title=Food web patterns and their consequences |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=350 |pages=669–674 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v350/n6320/abs/350669a0.html |author1=Pimm S.L., Lawton J.H.  |author2=Cohen J.E.  |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1038/350669a0 |issue=6320 |bibcode=1991Natur.350..669P}}&lt;/ref&gt; One problem faced in standardizing such measurements is that there are often too many species for each to have a separate box. Depending on the author, the number of species aggregated or separated into functional groups may be different.&lt;ref name="de Ruiter"&gt;{{citation |year=1996 |chapter=Energetics and stability in below ground food webs |title=Food webs: integration of patterns and dynamics |editors=G. Polis and K.O Winemiller |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |author=de Ruiter P.C., A.M. Neutel and J.C. Moore }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors may even eliminate some organisms. By convention, the dead material flowing back to detritus is not shown, as it would complicate the figure, but it is taken account in any calculations.&lt;ref name="de Ruiter" /&gt;

== Flow webs ==
Miosis build on interconnected food chains , adding quantitative information on the movement of carbon or other nutrients from producers to consumers. Hunt ''et al.'' (1987) published the first flow web for soil, describing the short grass [[prairie]] in Colorado, USA. The authors estimated nitrogen transferral rates through the soil food web and calculated nitrogen mineralization rates for a range of soil organisms. In another landmark study, researchers from the Lovinkhoeve Experimental Farm in the Netherlands examined the flow of [[carbon]] and illustrated transfer rates with arrows of different thicknesses.&lt;ref name=Brussaard &gt;{{citation |year=1988 |title=The Dutch Programme on soil ecology of arable farming systems I. Objectives, approach, and preliminary results |journal=Ecological Bulletins |volume=39 |pages=35–40 |author=Brussaard, L.J., A. van Veen, M.J. Kooistra, and G. Lebbink }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to create a flow web, a topological web is first constructed. After the members of the web are decided, the [[biomass]] of each functional group is calculated, usually in kg carbon/[[hectare]]. In order to calculate feeding rates, researchers assume that the population of the functional group is in equilibrium. At equilibrium, the reproduction of the group balances the rate at which members are lost through natural death and predation&lt;ref name=Hunt&gt;{{citation |year=1987 |title=The detrital food web in a shortgrass prairie |journal=Biology and Fertility of Soils |volume=3 |pages=57–68 |author=Hunt, H.W., D.C. Coleman, E.R. Ingham, R.E. Ingham, E.T. Elliott, J.C. Moore, S.L. Rose, C.P.P. Reid, and C.R. Morley }}&lt;/ref&gt; When feeding rate is known, the efficiency with which nutrients are converted into organism biomass can be calculated. This energy stored in the organism represents the amount available to be passed on to the next trophic level.

After constructing the first soil flow webs, researchers discovered that nutrients and energy flowed from lower resources to higher trophic levels through three main channels.&lt;ref name=Brussaard /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hunt /&gt; The bacterial and fungal channels had the largest energy flow, while the herbivory channel, in which organisms directly consumed plant roots, was smaller. It is now widely recognized that bacteria and fungi are critical to the decomposition of carbon and nitrogen and play important roles in both the [[carbon cycle]] and [[nitrogen cycle]].

=== Interaction web ===
An interaction web, shown above right,&lt;ref&gt;[[USDA]]-NRCS, 2004, [http://soils.usda.gov/sqi/concepts/soil_biology/soil_food_web.html "The Soil Food web"] in ''The Soil Biology Primer''.  Url accessed 2006–04-11&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to a topological web, but instead of showing the movement of energy or materials, the arrows show how one group influences another. In interaction food web models, every link has two direct effects, one of the resource on the consumer and one of the consumer on the resource.&lt;ref name=Stiling1999&gt;{{citation |last=Stiling |first=P. |year=1999 |title=Ecology, Theories and Applications. Third Edtn |publisher=Prentice Hall. New Jersey USA. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the resource on the consumer is positive, (the consumer gets to eat) and the effect on the resource by the consumer is negative (it is eaten). These direct, trophic, effects can lead to indirect effects. Indirect effects, represented by dashed lines, show the effect of one element on another to which it is not directly linked.&lt;ref name=Stiling1999 /&gt; For example, in the simple interaction web below, when the predator eats the root herbivore, the plant eaten by the herbivore may increase in biomass. We would then say that the predator has a beneficial indirect effect on the plant roots.

== Food web control ==

=== Bottom-up effects ===
Bottom-up effects occur when the density of a resource affects the density of its consumer.&lt;ref name=Shurin&gt;{{citation |year=2006 |title=All wet or dried up? Real differences between aquatic and terrestrial food webs |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume=273 |pages=1–9 |author=Shurin, J.B., D.S. Gruner, and H. Hillebrand |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3377 |issue=1582 |pmid=16519227 |pmc=1560001}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the figure above, an increase in root density causes an increase in herbivore density that causes a corresponding increase in predator density. [[Correlations]] in abundance or biomass between consumers and their resources give evidence for bottom-up control.&lt;ref name=Shurin /&gt; An often-cited example of a bottom-up effect is the relationship between herbivores and the [[primary productivity]] of plants. In terrestrial ecosystems, the [[biomass]] of herbivores and [[detritivore]]s increases with primary productivity. An increase in primary productivity will result in a larger influx of leaf litter into the soil ecosystem, which will provide more resources for bacterial and fungal populations to grow. More microbes will allow an increase in bacterial and fungal feeding [[nematodes]], which are eaten by mites and other predatory nematodes. Thus, the entire food web swells as more resources are added to the base.&lt;ref name=Shurin /&gt;  When ecologists use the term, bottom-up control, they are indicating that the biomass, abundance, or diversity of higher trophic levels depend on resources from lower trophic levels.&lt;ref name=Stiling1999 /&gt;

=== Top-down effects ===
Ideas about top-down control are much more difficult to evaluate. Top-down effects occur when the population density of a consumer affects that of its resource;&lt;ref name=Stiling1999 /&gt; for example, a predator affects the density of its prey. Top-down control, therefore, refers to situations where the abundance, diversity or biomass of lower trophic levels depends on effects from consumers at higher trophic levels.&lt;ref name=Stiling1999 /&gt; A [[trophic cascade]] is a type of top-down interaction that describes the indirect effects of predators. In a trophic cascade, predators induce effects that cascade down food chain and affect biomass of organisms at least two links away.&lt;ref name=Stiling1999 /&gt;

The importance of trophic cascades and top-down control in terrestrial ecosystems is actively debated in ecology (reviewed in Shurin ''et al.'' 2006) and the issue of whether trophic cascades occur in soils is no less complex&lt;ref name=Wardle&gt;{{citation |last=Wardle |first=D.A |year=2002 |title=Communities and Ecosystems: Linking the aboveground and belowground components ''Monographs in population biology'' |volume=31 |publisher=Princeton University Press. New Jersey }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trophic cascades do occur in both the bacterial and fungal energy channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Setälä  |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1007/s004420050859 |pmid=28308090 |issue=2 |bibcode=1999Oecol.120..279L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mikola and Setälä’s study, microbes eaten by nematodes grew faster when they were grazed upon frequently. This [[compensatory growth]] slowed when the microbe feeding nematodes were removed. Therefore, although top predators reduced the number of microbe feeding nematodes, there was no overall change in microbial biomass.

Besides the grazing effect, another barrier to top down control in soil ecosystems is widespread omnivory, which by increasing the number of trophic interactions, dampens effects from the top. The soil environment is also a matrix of different temperatures, moistures and nutrient levels, and many organisms are able to become dormant to withstand difficult times. Depending on conditions, predators may be separated from their potential prey by an insurmountable amount of space and time.

Any top-down effects that do occur will be limited in strength because soil food webs are donor controlled. Donor control means that consumers have little or no effect on the renewal or input of their resources.&lt;ref name=Stiling1999 /&gt; For example, aboveground herbivores can overgraze an area and decrease the grass population, but decomposers cannot directly influence the rate of falling plant litter. They can only indirectly influence the rate of input into their system through nutrient recycling which, by helping plants to grow, eventually creates more litter and detritus to fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |year=2003 |title=Top down is bottom up: does predation in the rhizosphere regulate aboveground dynamics? |journal=Ecology |volume=84 |pages=846–857 |author=Moore, J.C., K. McCann, H. Setälä, and P.C. de Ruiter |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0846:TIBDPI]2.0.CO;2 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the entire soil food web were completely donor controlled, however, [[bacterivore]]s and [[fungivore]]s would never greatly affect the bacteria and fungi they consume.

While bottom-up effects are no doubt important, many soil ecologists suspect that top-down effects are also sometimes significant. Certain predators or parasites, when added to the soil, can have a large effect on root herbivores and thereby indirectly affect plant fitness. For example, in a coastal shrubland food chain the native [[entomopathogenic nematode]], ''Heterorhabditis marelatus'', parasitized ghost moth caterpillars, and ghost moth caterpillars consumed the roots of bush lupine. The presence of ''H. marelatus'' correlated with lower caterpillar numbers and healthier plants. In addition, the researchers observed high mortality of bush lupine in the absence of entomopathogenic nematodes. These results implied that the nematode, as a natural enemy of the ghost moth caterpillar, protected the plant from damage. The authors even suggested that the interaction was strong enough to affect the population dynamics of bush lupine;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |year=1996 |title=Entomopathogenic nematodes: natural enemies of root-feeding caterpillars on bush lupine |journal=Oecologia (Berlin) |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=167–173 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t235587137165187/ |author=Strong, D. R., H.K. Kaya, A.V. Whipple, A.L, Child, S. Kraig, M. Bondonno, K. Dyer, and J.L. Maron |doi=10.1007/BF00333228 |pmid=28307747 |bibcode=1996Oecol.108..167S }}&lt;/ref&gt; this was supported in later experimental work with naturally-growing populations of bush lupine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  |year=2004 |title=Climate affects predator control of an herbivore outbreak |journal=American Naturalist |volume=163 |pages=754–762 |doi=10.1086/383620 |author1=Evan L. Preisser  |author2=Donald R. Strong   |lastauthoramp=yes |issue=5  |pmid=15122492 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Top down control has applications in agriculture and is the principle behind [[biological control]], the idea that plants can benefit from the application of their herbivore’s enemies. While wasps and ladybugs are commonly associated with biological control, parasitic nematodes and predatory mites are also added to the soil to suppress pest populations and preserve crop plants. In order to use such biological control agents effectively, a knowledge of the local soil food web is important.

== Community matrix models ==
A [[community matrix]] model is a type of interaction web that uses differential equations to describe every link in the topological web. Using [[Lotka-Volterra equation]]s, that describe predator-prey interactions, and food web energetics data such as biomass and feeding rate, the strength of interactions between groups is calculated.&lt;ref name="de Ruiter1995"&gt;{{citation |year=1995 |title=Energetics, patterns of interaction strengths, and stability in real ecosystems |journal=[[Science (magazine)|Science]] |volume=269 |pages=1257–1260 |bibcode=1995Sci...269.1257D |author=de Ruiter, P.C., Neutel, A.-M., &amp; Moore, J.C. |last2=Neutel |last3=Moore |doi=10.1126/science.269.5228.1257 |pmid=17732112 |issue=5228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Community matrix models can also show how small changes affect the overall stability of the web.

== Stability of food webs ==
Mathematical modeling in food webs has raised the question of whether complex or simple food webs are more stable. Until the last decade, it was believed that soil food webs were relatively simple, with low degrees of connectance and omnivory.&lt;ref name=Wardle /&gt; These ideas stemmed from the mathematical models of May which predicted that complexity destabilized food webs. May used community matrices in which species were randomly linked with random interaction strength to show that local stability decreases with complexity (measured as connectance), diversity, and average interaction strength among species.&lt;ref name=May&gt;{{citation |last=May |first=R.M |year=1973 |title=Stability and complexity in model ecosystems |publisher=Princeton: Princeton University Press. New Jersey }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of such random community matrices attracted much criticism. In other areas of ecology, it was realized that the food webs used to make these models were grossly oversimplified&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |year=1991 |title=Complex trophic interactions in deserts: an empirical critique of food web theory |journal=American Naturalist |volume=138 |pages=123–155 |author=Polis, G.A. |doi=10.1086/285208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not represent the complexity of real ecosystems. It also became clear that soil food webs did not conform to these predictions. Soil ecologists discovered that omnivory in food webs was common,&lt;ref name=Walter&gt;{{citation |year=1991 |title=Missing links: a review of methods used to estimate trophic links in food webs |journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment |volume=34 |pages=399–405 |url= https://zenodo.org/record/1258391|author1=Walter, D.E. D.T. Kaplan |author2=T.A. Permar  |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1016/0167-8809(91)90123-F|format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that food chains could be long and complex&lt;ref name=Hunt /&gt; and still remain resistant to disturbance by drying, freezing, and fumigation.&lt;ref name=Wardle /&gt;

But why are complex food webs more stable? Many of the barriers to top-down trophic cascades also promote stability. Complex food webs may be more stable if the interaction strengths are weak&lt;ref name=May /&gt; and soil food webs appear to consist of many weak interactions and a few strong ones.&lt;ref name="de Ruiter1995" /&gt; Donor controlled food webs may be inherently more stable, because it is difficult for primary consumers to overtax their resources.&lt;ref name="De Angelis"&gt;{{citation |last=De Angelis |first=D.L. |year=1992 |title=Dynamics of nutrient cycling and food webs |publisher=Chapman and Hall. London. England |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NHFBDX9-7L0C&amp;pg=PA190 |isbn=978-0-12-088458-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of the soil also acts as a buffer, separating organisms and preventing strong interactions.&lt;ref name=Wardle /&gt; Many soil organisms, for example bacteria, can remain dormant through difficult times and reproduce quickly once conditions improve, making them resilient to disturbance.

Stability of the system is reduced by the use of nitrogen-containing inorganic and organic fertilizers, which cause [[soil acidification]].

== Interactions not included in food webs ==
Despite their complexity, some interactions between species in the soil are not easily classified by food webs. Litter transformers, mutualists, and ecosystem engineers all have strong impacts on their communities that cannot be characterized as either top-down or bottom-up.

Litter transformers, such as [[isopod]]s, consume dead plants and excrete fecal pellets. While on the surface this may not seem impressive, the fecal pellets are moister and higher in nutrients than the surrounding soil, which favors colonization by bacteria and fungi. Decomposition of the fecal pellet by the microbes increases its nutrient value and the isopod is able to re-ingest the pellets. When the isopods consume nutrient-poor litter, the microbes enrich it for them and isopods prevented from eating their own feces can die.&lt;ref name=Hassall&gt;{{citation |year=1982 |title=The role of coprophagy in the feeding strategies of terrestrial isopods |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g056115700k7q277/ |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=53 |pages=374–381 |author=Hassall, M., S.P. Rushton |doi=10.1007/BF00389017 |pmid=28311744 |issue=3 |bibcode=1982Oecol..53..374H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship has been called an “external rumen”, similar to the mutualistic relationship between bacteria and cows. While the bacterial symbionts of cows live inside the [[rumen]] of their stomach, isopods depend on microbes outside their body.

Ecosystems engineers, such as earthworms, modify their environment and create habitat for other smaller organisms. Earthworms also stimulate microbial activity by increasing soil aeration and moisture, and transporting litter into the ground where it becomes available to other soil fauna.&lt;ref name=Wardle /&gt;  Fungi create nutritional niche for other organisms by enriching nutritionally extremelly scarce food - the dead wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Filipiak|first=Michał|last2=Sobczyk|first2=Łukasz|last3=Weiner|first3=January|date=2016-04-09|title=Fungal Transformation of Tree Stumps into a Suitable Resource for Xylophagous Beetles via Changes in Elemental Ratios|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/7/2/13|journal=Insects|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=13|doi=10.3390/insects7020013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows [[Xylophagy|xylophages]] to develop and in turn affect dead wood, contributing to wood decomposition and nutrient cycling in the forest floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Filipiak|first=Michał|last2=Weiner|first2=January|date=2016-09-01|title=Nutritional dynamics during the development of xylophagous beetles related to changes in the stoichiometry of 11 elements|journal=Physiological Entomology|volume=42|language=en|pages=73-84|doi=10.1111/phen.12168|issn=1365-3032|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In aboveground and aquatic food webs, the literature assumes that the most important interactions are competition and predation. While soil food webs fit these sorts of interactions well, future research needs to include more complex interactions such as mutualisms and habitat modification.

While they cannot characterize all interactions, soil food webs remain a useful tool for describing ecosystems. The interactions between species in the soil and their effect on decomposition continue to be well studied. Much remains unknown, however, about soil food webs stability and how food webs change over time.&lt;ref name=Wardle /&gt;  This knowledge is critical to understanding how food webs affect important qualities such as soil fertility.

In contrast, gametes are cells that fuse during [[sexual reproduction]], [[germ cell]]s are cells that give rise to gametes, and [[stem cells]] are cells that can divide through [[mitosis]] and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into diverse specialized cell types. For example, in [[mammal]]s, somatic cells make up all the internal organs, skin, bones, blood and connective tissue, while mammalian germ cells give rise to [[spermatozoa]] and [[ovum|ova]] which fuse during [[fertilization]] to produce a cell called a [[zygote]], which divides and differentiates into the cells of an [[embryo]]. There are approximately 220 types of somatic cells in the human body.&lt;ref name="campbell229"/&gt;

Theoretically, these cells are not germ cells (the source of gametes); they never transmit to their descendants the mutations they have undergone. However, in [[sponge]]s, non-differentiated somatic cells form the germ line and, in [[Cnidaria]], differentiated somatic cells are the source of the germline.

The word "somatic" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''sōma'', meaning "body".

==Evolution==
As [[multicellularity]] evolved many times, sterile somatic cells did too. The evolution of an immortal [[germline]] producing specialized somatic cells involved the emergence of [[Death#In biology|mortality]], and can be viewed in its simplest version in [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3098969 | pmid=21174128 | doi=10.1007/s00497-010-0158-4 | volume=24 | title=Evolution of reproductive development in the volvocine algae | year=2011 | journal=Sex. Plant Reprod. | pages=97–112 | author=Hallmann A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those species with a separation between sterile somatic cells and a germ line are called [[Weismann barrier|Weismannists]]. However, Weismannist development is relatively rare (e.g., [[vertebrate]]s, [[arthropod]]s, ''[[Volvox]]''), as a great number of species have the capacity for [[somatic embryogenesis]] (e.g., [[land plant]]s, most [[algae]], many [[invertebrates]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 29-297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niklas, K. J. (2014) [http://www.amjbot.org/content/101/1/6.long The evolutionary-developmental origins of multicellularity].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics and chromosome content==
Like all cells, somatic cells contain [[DNA]] arranged in [[chromosome]]s.  If a somatic cell contains chromosomes arranged in pairs, it is called [[diploid]] and the organism is called a diploid organism. (The gametes of diploid organisms contain only single unpaired chromosomes and are called [[haploid]].)  Each pair of chromosomes comprises one chromosome inherited from the father and one inherited from the mother. For example, in humans, somatic cells contain 46 [[chromosomes]] organized into 23 pairs.  By contrast, gametes of diploid organisms contain only half as many chromosomes. In humans, this is 23 unpaired chromosomes. When two gametes (i.e. a spermatozoon and an ovum) meet during conception, they fuse together, creating a [[zygote]]. Due to the fusion of the two gametes, a human zygote contains 46 chromosomes (i.e. 23 pairs).

However, a large number of [[species]] have the chromosomes in their somatic cells arranged in fours ("[[tetraploid]]") or even sixes ("[[hexaploid]]"). Thus, they can have diploid or even triploid germline cells. An example of this is the modern cultivated species of [[wheat]], ''Triticum aestivum L.'', a hexaploid species whose somatic cells contain six copies of every [[chromatid]].

The frequency of spontaneous [[mutation]]s is significantly lower in advanced male [[germ cell]]s than in somatic cell types from the same individual.&lt;ref name="pmid9707592"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walter CA, Intano GW, McCarrey JR, McMahan CA, Walter RB |title=Mutation frequency declines during spermatogenesis in young mice but increases in old mice |journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |volume=95 |issue=17 |pages=10015–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9707592 |pmc=21453 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.95.17.10015|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Female germ cells also show a mutation frequency that is lower than that in corresponding somatic cells and similar to that in male germ cells.&lt;ref name="pmid23153565"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphey P, McLean DJ, McMahan CA, Walter CA, McCarrey JR |title=Enhanced genetic integrity in mouse germ cells |journal=Biol.

Such mechanisms likely include elevated levels of [[DNA repair]] enzymes that ameliorate most potentially mutagenic [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damages]].&lt;ref name="pmid23153565" /&gt;

==Cloning==
In recent years, the technique of [[cloning]] whole organisms has been developed in mammals, allowing almost identical genetic clones of an animal to be produced. One method of doing this is called "[[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]" and involves removing the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] from a somatic cell, usually a skin cell. This nucleus contains all of the genetic information needed to produce the organism it was removed from. This nucleus is then injected into an [[ovum]] of the same species which has had its own genetic material removed. The ovum now no longer needs to be fertilized, because it contains the correct amount of genetic material (a [[diploid]] number of [[chromosomes]]). In theory, the ovum can be implanted into the [[uterus]] of a same-species animal and allowed to develop. The resulting animal will be a nearly genetically identical clone to the animal from which the nucleus was taken. The only difference is caused by any [[mitochondria]]l DNA that is retained in the ovum, which is different from the cell that donated the nucleus.  In practice, this technique has so far been problematic, although there have been a few high-profile successes, such as [[Dolly the Sheep]] and, more recently, [[Snuppy]], the first cloned [[dog]].
Somatic cells have also been collected in the practice of [[cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]] as a means of conserving animal genetic material, including to clone livestock.

==Genetic Modifications==
Development of [[biotechnology]] has allowed for the genetic manipulation of somatic cells, whether for the modelling of chronic disease or for the prevention of malaise conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somatic genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 generates and corrects a metabolic disease|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep44624|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH Commits $190M to Somatic Gene-Editing Tools/Tech Research|url=https://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/nih-commits-190m-to-somatic-gene-editing-toolstech-research/81255414|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic engineering of somatic cells has resulted in some [[Human genetic engineering#Controversy|controversies]], although the International Summit on Human Gene Editing has released a statement in support of genetic modification of somatic cells, as the modifications thereof are not passed on to offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Treat Gene Editing Differently In Two Types Of Human Cells?|url=http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/why-treat-gene-editing-differently-two-types-human-cells/|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Speed learning''' is a collection of methods of [[learning]] which attempt to attain higher rates of learning without unacceptable reduction of [[Understanding|comprehension]] or [[Storage (memory)|retention]]. It is closely related to [[speed reading]], but encompasses other methods of learning, such as [[observation]], [[listening]], [[conversation]], [[question]]ing, and [[Introspection|reflection]].

The general approach is to use procedures or a sequence of techniques that have been shown to provide a more efficient path to attaining the same goal. Some of the techniques have existed since ancient times (e.g. [[Mnemonic]]s) whilst others are a result of more recent scientific research (e.g. [[Forgetting curve|Forgetting Curves]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0993496424|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
[[Psychologist]]s and [[education]]al specialists have long sought methods for improving not just the quality of learning, the comprehension and retention of knowledge, but the rate at which knowledge can be acquired, especially in an age in which the amount of information people need to deal with is growing rapidly and threatening to overwhelm them.

The limited "channel capacity" of human individuals has also led to investigation of rapid knowledge acquisition and appropriate dissemination of it by organizations. This is an important part of the science of [[management]]. It generally involves dividing the knowledge-acquisition effort among multiple individuals, each of whom becomes a "subject matter expert" on some specialized area of the larger topic, then having them extract and abstract the more important findings and recommendations from that investigation into reports to and discussions with others in the organization. This filtering process necessarily involves some loss of detail, but if done well should enable the organization or its managers to make high-quality, error-avoiding decisions. On the other hand, the loss of detail as abstraction of information ascends a hierarchical organization can lead to distortion that results in bad decision-making.

This article is about the concept in biology. For the concept in physics, see [[Symmetry breaking]].

'''Symmetry breaking''' is the process by which uniformity is broken, or the number of points to view invariance are reduced, to generate a more structured and improbable state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Rong|author2=Bruce Bowerman |title=Symmetry Breaking in Biology|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2010|volume=2|issue=3|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a003475|pmid=20300216|pages=a003475|pmc=2829966}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is to say, symmetry breaking is the event where symmetry along a particular axis is lost to establish a polarity.  [[Cell polarity|Polarity]] is a measure for a biological system to distinguish poles along an axis.  This measure is important because it is the first step to building complexity.  For example, during organismal development, one of the first steps for the embryo is to distinguish its [[Ventral#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal-ventral axis]].  The symmetry-breaking event that occurs here will determine which end of this axis will be the ventral side, and which end will be the dorsal side.  Once this distinction is made, then all the structures that are located along this axis can develop at the proper location.  As an example, during human development, the embryo needs to establish where is ‘back’ and where is ‘front’ before complex structures, such as the spine and lungs, can develop in the right location (where the lungs is placed ‘in front’ of the spine).  This relationship between symmetry breaking and complexity was articulated by [[P.W. Anderson]].  He speculated that increasing levels of broken symmetry in many-body systems correlates with increasing complexity and functional specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Philip W.|title=More is Different|journal=Science|year=1972|volume=177|issue=4047|pages=393–396|doi=10.1126/science.177.4047.393|pmid=17796623}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a biological perspective, the more complex an organism is, the higher number of symmetry-breaking events can be found.  Without symmetry breaking, building complexity in organisms would be very difficult.

The importance of symmetry breaking in biology is also reflected in the fact that it’s found at all scales.  Symmetry breaking can be found at the macromolecular level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Fei|title=The Signaling Mechanisms Underlying Cell Polarity and Chemotaxis|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2009|volume=1|issue=4|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a002980|pmid=20066099|pages=a002980|pmc=2773618}}&lt;/ref&gt;  at the subcellular level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Jonathan|title=Cellular Polarity in Prokaryotic Organisms|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2009|volume=1|issue=6|pmid=20457568|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a003368|pages=a003368|pmc=2882128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and even at the tissues and organ level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=James W.|title=Remodeling epithelial cell organization: Transitions between front-rear and apical-basal polarity|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology|year=2009|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a000513|pages=a000513|pmc=2742086}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It’s also interesting to note that most asymmetry on a higher scale is a reflection of symmetry breaking on a lower scale.  Cells first need to establish a polarity through a symmetry-breaking event before tissues and organs themselves can be polar.  For example, one model proposes that left-right body axis asymmetry in vertebrates is determined by asymmetry of [[Cilium|cilia]] rotation during early development, which will produces a constant, unidirectional flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babu|first=Deepak|author2=Sudipto Roy |title=Left–right asymmetry: cilia stir up new surprises in the node|journal=Open Biology|year=2013|volume=3|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuznetsov|first1=A.

There are several examples of symmetry breaking that are currently being studied.  One of the most studied examples is the cortical rotation during ''Xenopus'' development, where this rotation acts as the symmetry-breaking event that determines the dorsal-ventral axis of the developing embryo.  This example is discussed in more detail below.
&lt;br&gt;Another example that involves symmetry breaking is the establishment of dendrites and axon during [[neuron]] development, and the PAR protein network in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''. It is thought that a protein called shootin-1 determines which outgrowth in neurons eventually becomes the axon, at it does this by breaking symmetry and accumulating in only one outgrowth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toriyama|first=Michinori|author2=Tadayuki Shimada |author3=Ki Bum Kim |author4=Mari Mitsuba |author5=Eiko Nomura |author6=Kazuhiro Katsuta |author7=Yuichi Sakumura |author8=Peter Roepstorff |author9=Naoyuki Inagaki  |title=Shootin1: A protein involved in the organization of an asymmetric signal for neuronal polarization|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|year=2006|volume=175|issue=1|pages=147–157 |doi=10.1083/jcb.200604160 |pmid=17030985 |pmc=2064506}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PAR protein network works under similar mechanisms, where the certain PAR proteins, which are initially homogenous throughout the cell, break their symmetry and are segregated to different ends of the zygote to establish a polarity during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Motegi|first=Fumio|author2=Geraldine Seydoux |title=The PAR network: redundancy and robustness in a symmetry-breaking system|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|year=2013|volume=368|issue=1629|doi=10.1098/rstb.2013.0010|pages=20130010|pmc=3785961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cortical Rotation==
'''Cortical rotation''' is a phenomenon that seems to be limited to ''Xenopus'' and few ancient [[Teleostei|teleosts]], however the underlying mechanisms of cortical rotation have conserved elements that are found in other [[chordate]]s.  Research in this area is on-going and changes to the model described below are to be expected.
In fact, the origin of asymmetry in cell division, cell polarity and the mechanism that breaks the symmetry continue to be topics of intense research.  Since the early 1990s, many discoveries have been made leading to a sound model of the mechanism for symmetry breaking.  This article will focus solely on symmetry breaking in the ''[[Xenopus]]'' embryo, an animal model that has wide application.

A sperm can bind a ''Xenopus'' egg at any position of the pigmented animal hemisphere; however once bound this position then determines the dorsal side of the animal.  The dorsal side of the [[Egg (biology)|egg]] is always directly opposite the [[sperm]] entry point.  The reason being the sperm's [[centriole]] acts as an organizing center for the egg’s [[microtubule]]s. While this observation has been known for quite some time, the question of how all of this works is more complicated.  The molecular mechanisms driving dorsal-ventral asymmetry are a fine example of simplicity and complexity inherent in biology.

==Molecular mechanisms==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Xenopus cortical rotation.jpg|thumb|Schematic of ''Xenopus'' embryo showing some of the molecular mechanisms during cortical rotation.  The sperm centriole acts as a (-) end organizer for microtubules in the cytoplasm of the embryo.  The microtubules grow outward toward the plus end and interact with an area of the embryo call the cortex, which has microtubules that organize (+ end) in the direction of the cortical rotation.  The cortex and cytoplasm are differentiated by density, as the cytoplasm contains the dense yolk of the embryo.
During cortical rotation, microtubules are linked via kinesin motors to elements within the cortex (which are linked to the plasma membrane) and the movement along the microtubules allow the kinesin motors to physically shift the cortex.  This alone does not explain dorsal-ventral axis development, as it has been shown to occur without polymerized microtubules, thus movement of these dorsal-determining elements can occur independent of the cortical microtubule array.  These elements, a signalosome which incompasses Dsh, Wnt 11 (mRNA), β-catenin (mRNA), Fz-7, GSK3, likely occur together in vessicles. VegT acts with Wnt 11 at the dorsal side to activate Xnr1 and Nodal genes that propagate development. {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
A series of experiments utilizing UV irradiation, cold temperature and pressure (all of which cause microtubule depolymerization) demonstrated that without polymerized microtubules cortical rotation did not occur and resulted in a mutant ventral phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerhart J, Danilchik M, Doniach T, Roberts S, Rowning B, Stewart R |title=Cortical rotation of the ''Xenopus'' egg: consequences for the anteroposterior pattern of embryonic dorsal development |journal=Development |volume=107 |issue=Suppl |pages=37–51 |year=1989 |pmid=2699856 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study also revealed that mutant phenotype could be rescued (returned to normal) by physically turning the embryo, thus mimicking cortical rotation and demonstrating that microtubules were not the determinant of dorsal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(80)90082-2 |vauthors=Scharf SR, Gerhart JC |title=Determination of the dorsal-ventral axis in eggs of ''Xenopus laevis'': complete rescue of UV-impaired eggs by oblique orientation before first cleavage |journal=Dev.

To identify these elements, researchers looked for mRNA and protein that demonstrated localization to either the vegetal pole or the dorsal side of the embryo to find candidates.

The Dsh protein was fused to a GFP and tracked during cortical rotation, it was observed to be in vesicles that were couriered along microtubules to the dorsal side.  This led researchers to look into other candidates of the Wnt pathway.  Wnt 11 was found to be located specifically at the vegetal pole prior to cortical rotation and is moved to the dorsal side where it activates the [[wnt signaling pathway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tao Q, Yokota C, Puck H, Kofron M, Birsoy B, Yan D, Asashima M, Wylie CC, Lin X, Heasman J |title=Maternal wnt11 activates the canonical wnt signaling pathway required for axis formation in ''Xenopus'' embryos |journal=Cell |volume=120 |issue= 6|pages=857–71 |year=2005 |pmid=15797385 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  VegT, a T-box transcription factor, is localized to the vegetal cortex and upon cortical rotation is released in a gradient fashion into the embryo to regulate mesoderm development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang J, King ML |title=''Xenopus'' VegT RNA is localized to the vegetal cortex during oogenesis and encodes a novel T-box transcription factor involved in mesodermal patterning |journal=Development |volume=122 |issue=12 |pages=4119–29 |date=December 1996 |pmid=9012531 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9012531}}&lt;/ref&gt;  VegT activates Wnt expression, so while not acted on or moved during cortical rotation, it is active in dorsal-ventral axis formation.

The question still remains, how are these molecules being moved to the dorsal side?  This is still not completely known, however evidence suggests that microtubule bundles within the cortex are interacting with kinesin (plus-end directed) motors to become organized into parallel arrays within the cortex and this motion of the motors is the cause of the rotation of the cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marrari Y, Rouviere C, Houliston E |title=Complementary roles for dynein and kinesins in the ''Xenopus'' egg cortical rotation |journal=Dev Biol |volume=271 |issue= 1|pages=38–48 |year=2004 |pmid=15196948 |doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.03.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also unclear is whether Wnt 11 is the main dorsal determinant or is β-catenin also required, as these two molecules have both been demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient for dorsal development.  This along with all of the other factors are important for activating Nodal genes that propagate normal dorsoventral development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21818">A '''temporal database''' stores data relating to time instances. It offers temporal data types and stores information relating to past, present and future time.
The temporal database has two major notions or attributes.
1. valid time.
2. transaction time.
More specifically the temporal aspects usually include [[valid time]] and [[transaction time]]. These attributes can be combined to form bitemporal data.

* '''Valid time''' is the time period during which a fact is true in the real world.
* '''Transaction time''' is the time period during which a fact stored in the database was known.
* '''Bitemporal data''' combines both Valid and Transaction Time.

It is possible to have timelines other than Valid Time and Transaction Time, such as Decision Time, in the database. In that case the database is called a multitemporal database as opposed to a bitemporal database. However, this approach introduces additional complexities such as dealing with the validity of (foreign) keys.

Temporal databases are in contrast to [[current database]]s (not to be confused with currently available databases), which store only facts which are believed to be true at the current time.

==Features==
Temporal databases support managing and accessing temporal data by providing one or more of the following features:&lt;ref name="SQL2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DB2"/&gt;

* A time period datatype, including the ability to represent time periods with no end (infinity or forever)
* The ability to define valid and transaction time period attributes and bitemporal relations
* System-maintained transaction time
* Temporal [[primary keys]], including non-overlapping period constraints
* Temporal constraints, including non-overlapping uniqueness and [[referential integrity]]
* Update and deletion of temporal records with automatic splitting and coalescing of time periods
* Temporal queries at current time, time points in the past or future, or over durations
* Predicates for querying time periods, often based on [[Allen's interval algebra#Relations|Allen’s interval relations]]

==History==
With the development of SQL and its attendant use in real-life applications, database users realized that when they added date columns to key fields, some issues arose.  For example, if a table has a primary key and some attributes, adding a date to the primary key to track historical changes can lead to creation of more rows than intended.  Deletes must also be handled differently when rows are tracked in this way.  In 1992, this issue was recognized but standard database theory was not yet up to resolving this issue, and neither was the then-newly formalized [[SQL-92]] standard.

[[Richard Snodgrass]] proposed in 1992 that temporal extensions to SQL be developed by the temporal database community. In response to this proposal, a committee was formed to design extensions to the 1992 edition of the SQL standard (ANSI X3.135.-1992 and ISO/IEC 9075:1992); those extensions, known as TSQL2, were developed during 1993 by this committee.&lt;ref name="snodgrass9"&gt;Snodgrass, 1999, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1993, Snodgrass presented this work to the group responsible for the American National Standard for Database Language SQL, ANSI Technical Committee X3H2 (now known as NCITS H2). The preliminary language specification appeared in the March 1994 ACM SIGMOD Record. Based on responses to that specification, changes were made to the language, and the definitive version of the TSQL2 Language Specification was published in September, 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt was made to incorporate parts of TSQL2 into the new SQL standard [[SQL:1999]], called SQL3. Parts of TSQL2 were included in a new substandard of SQL3, ISO/IEC 9075-7, called SQL/Temporal.&lt;ref name="snodgrass9"/&gt; The TSQL2 approach was heavily criticized by [[Chris Date]] and [[Hugh Darwen]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Darwen, C.J. Date, “[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.116.7598 An overview and Analysis of Proposals Based on the TSQL2 Approach]”, In ''Date on Database: Writings 2000-2006'', C.J. Date, Apress, 2006, pp. 481-514&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO project responsible for temporal support was canceled near the end of 2001.

As of December 2011, ISO/IEC 9075, Database Language [[SQL:2011]] Part 2: SQL/Foundation included clauses in table definitions to define "application-time period tables" ([[valid time]] tables), "system-versioned tables" ([[transaction time]] tables) and "system-versioned application-time period tables" ([[bitemporal]] tables). A substantive difference between the TSQL2 proposal and what was adopted in SQL:2011 is that there are no hidden columns in the SQL:2011 treatment, nor does it have a new data type for intervals; instead two date or timestamp columns can be bound together using a &lt;code&gt;PERIOD FOR&lt;/code&gt; declaration. Another difference is replacement of the controversial (prefix) statement modifiers from TSQL2 with a set of temporal predicates.&lt;ref name="SQL2011"/&gt;

Another features of [[SQL:2011]] standard related with temporal databases are the Automatic time period splitting, Temporal primary keys, Temporal referential integrity, Temporal predicates with [[Allen's interval algebra]] and Time-sliced and sequenced queries.

==Example==
For illustration, consider the following short biography of a fictional man, John Doe:

:John Doe was born on April 3, 1975 in the Kids Hospital of Medicine County, as son of Jack Doe and Jane Doe who lived in Smallville. Jack Doe proudly registered the birth of his first-born on April 4, 1975 at the Smallville City Hall. John grew up as a joyful boy, turned out to be a brilliant student and graduated with honors in 1993. After graduation, he went to live on his own in Bigtown. Although he moved out on August 26, 1994, he forgot to register the change of address officially. It was only at the turn of the seasons that his mother reminded him that he had to register, which he did a few days later on December 27, 1994. Although John had a promising future, his story ends tragically. John Doe was accidentally hit by a truck on April 1, 2001. The coroner reported his date of death on the very same day.

===Using a current database===
To store the life of John Doe in a current (non-temporal) database we use a table ''Person (Name, Address)''. (In order to simplify ''Name'' is defined as the [[primary key]] of ''Person''.)

John's father officially reported his birth on April 4, 1975. On this date a Smallville official inserted the following entry in the database: &lt;code&gt;Person(John Doe, Smallville)&lt;/code&gt;.
Note that the date itself is not stored in the database.

After graduation, John moves out, but forgets to register his new address. John's entry in the database is not changed until December 27, 1994, when he finally reports it. A Bigtown official updates his address in the database. The ''Person'' table now contains &lt;code&gt;Person(John Doe, Bigtown)&lt;/code&gt;.
Note that the information of John living in Smallville has been overwritten, so it is no longer possible to retrieve that information from the database. An official accessing the database on December 28, 1994 would be told that John lives in Bigtown.
More technically: if a database administrator ran the query &lt;code&gt;SELECT ADDRESS FROM PERSON WHERE NAME='John Doe'&lt;/code&gt; on December 26, 1994, the result would be &lt;code&gt;Smallville&lt;/code&gt;. Running the same query 2 days later would result in &lt;code&gt;Bigtown&lt;/code&gt;.

Until his death, the database would state that he lived in Bigtown. On April 1, 2001, the coroner deletes the John Doe entry from the database. After this, running the above query would return no result at all.

===Using Valid time===
{{Main article|Valid time}}[[Valid time]] is the time for which a fact is true in the real world. A valid time period may be in the past, span the current time, or occur in the future.

For the example above, to record valid time, the ''Person'' table has two fields added, ''Valid-From'' and ''Valid-To''.  These specify the period when a person's address is valid in the real world.
On April 4, 1975 John's father registered his son's birth. An official then inserts a new entry into the database stating that John lives in Smallville from April 3. Note that although the data was inserted on the 4th, the database states that the information is valid since the 3rd. The official does not yet know if or when John will move to another place, so the ''Valid-To'' field is set to [[infinity]] (∞). The entry in the database is:

 Person(John Doe, Smallville, 3-Apr-1975, ∞).

On December 27, 1994 John reports his new address in Bigtown where he has been living since August 26, 1994. A new database entry is made to record this fact:

 Person(John Doe, Bigtown, 26-Aug-1994, ∞).

The original entry &lt;code&gt;Person (John Doe, Smallville, 3-Apr-1975, ∞)&lt;/code&gt; is not deleted, but has the ''Valid-To'' attribute updated to reflect that it is now known that John stopped living in Smallville on August 26, 1994.
The database now contains two entries for John Doe

 Person(John Doe, Smallville, 3-Apr-1975, 26-Aug-1994).
 Person(John Doe, Bigtown, 26-Aug-1994, ∞).

When John dies his current entry in the database is updated stating that John does not live in Bigtown any longer. The database now looks like this

 Person(John Doe, Smallville, 3-Apr-1975, 26-Aug-1994).
 Person(John Doe, Bigtown, 26-Aug-1994, 1-Apr-2001).

===Using Transaction time===
{{Main article|Transaction time}}[[Transaction time]] records the time period during which a database entry is accepted as correct. This enables queries that show the state of the database at a given time. Transaction time periods can only occur in the past or up to the current time.  In a transaction time table, records are never deleted. Only new records can be inserted, and existing ones updated by setting their transaction end time to show that they are no longer current.

To enable transaction time in the example above, two more fields are added to the Person table: ''Transaction-From'' and ''Transaction-To''. ''Transaction-From'' is the time a transaction was made, and ''Transaction-To'' is the time that the transaction was superseded (which may be infinity if it has not yet been superseded).  This makes the table into a [[#Bitemporal_relations|bitemporal table]].

What happens if the person's address as stored in the database is incorrect? Suppose an official accidentally entered the wrong address or date? Or, suppose the person lied about their address for some reason. Upon discovery of the error, the officials update the database to correct the information recorded.

For example, from 1-Jun-1995 to 3-Sep-2000, John Doe moved to Beachy. But to avoid paying Beachy's exorbitant residence tax, he never reported it to the authorities. Later during a tax investigation, it is discovered on 2-Feb-2001 that he was in fact in Beachy during those dates.  To record this fact, the existing entry about John living in Bigtown must be split into two separate records, and a new record inserted recording his residence in Beachy. The database would then appear as follows:

 Person(John Doe, Smallville, 3-Apr-1975, 26-Aug-1994).
 Person(John Doe, Bigtown, 26-Aug-1994, 1-Jun-1995).
 Person(John Doe, Beachy, 1-Jun-1995, 3-Sep-2000).
 Person(John Doe, Bigtown, 3-Sep-2000, 1-Apr-2001).

However, this leaves no record that the database ever claimed that he lived in Bigtown during 1-Jun-1995 to 3-Sep-2000. This might be important to know for auditing reasons, or to use as evidence in the official's tax investigation. Transaction time allows capturing this changing knowledge in the database, since entries are never directly modified or deleted.  Instead, each entry records when it was entered and when it was superseded (or logically deleted). The database contents then look like this:

 Name, City, Valid From, Valid Till, Entered, Superseded

 Person(John Doe, Smallville, 3-Apr-1975,  ∞,           4-Apr-1975,  27-Dec-1994).
 Person(John Doe, Smallville, 3-Apr-1975,  26-Aug-1994, 27-Dec-1994, ∞          ).
 Person(John Doe, Bigtown,    26-Aug-1994, ∞,           27-Dec-1994, 2-Feb-2001 ).
 Person(John Doe, Bigtown,    26-Aug-1994, 1-Jun-1995,  2-Feb-2001,  ∞          ).
 Person(John Doe, Beachy,     1-Jun-1995,  3-Sep-2000,  2-Feb-2001,  ∞          ).
 Person(John Doe, Bigtown,    3-Sep-2000,  ∞,           2-Feb-2001,  1-Apr-2001 ).
 Person(John Doe, Bigtown,    3-Sep-2000,  1-Apr-2001,  1-Apr-2001,  ∞          ).

The database records not only what happened in the real world, but also what was officially recorded at different times.

==Bitemporal relations==
{{Main article|Bitemporal Modeling}}
A [[Bitemporal Modeling|bitemporal relation]] contains both valid and transaction time. This provides both '''historical''' and '''rollback''' information. Historical information (e.g.: "Where did John live in 1992?") is provided by the valid time. Rollback (e.g.: "In 1992, where did the database believe John lived?") is provided by the transaction time. The answers to these example questions may not be the same{{snd}} the database may have been altered since 1992, causing the queries to produce different results.

The valid time and transaction time do not have to be the same for a single fact. For example, consider a temporal database storing data about the 18th century. The valid time of these facts is somewhere between 1701 and 1800.  The transaction time would show when the facts were inserted into the database (for example, January 21, 1998).

==Schema evolution==
{{Main article|Schema evolution}}
A challenging issue is the support of temporal queries in a transaction time database under evolving [[database schema|schema]]. In order to achieve perfect archival quality it is of key importance to store the data under the schema version under which they first appeared. However, even the most simple temporal query rewriting the history of an attribute value would be required to be manually rewritten under each of the schema versions, potentially hundreds as in the case of MediaWiki [http://yellowstone.cs.ucla.edu/schema-evolution/index.php/Schema_Evolution_Benchmark].
This process would be particularly taxing for users. A proposed solution is to provide automatic query rewriting,&lt;ref name="curino-vldb-prima2008"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is not part of SQL or similar standards.

A suggested approach to supposedly minimize the complexities of [[schema evolution]] is to use a so-called "schema-agnostic" NoSQL database which allegedly reduces the complexities of modeling bitemporal data.&lt;ref name="mlw-talk-why-banks-need-bitemporal-2015"&gt;{{cite conference

==Implementations in notable products==
The following implementations provide temporal features in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

* [[MariaDB]] version 10.3.4 added support for [[SQL:2011]] standard as "System-Versioned Tables".&lt;ref&gt;https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/system-versioned-tables/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Oracle Database]]{{snd}} Oracle Workspace Manager is a feature of Oracle Database which enables application developers and DBAs to manage current, proposed and historical versions of data in the same database.
* [[PostgreSQL]] version 9.2 added native ranged data types that are capable of implementing all of the features of the pgFoundry temporal contributed extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paquier|first1=Michael|title=Postgres 9.2 highlight: range types |url=http://michael.otacoo.com/postgresql-2/postgres-9-2-highlight-range-types/ |date=1 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423215529/http://michael.otacoo.com/postgresql-2/postgres-9-2-highlight-range-types/ |archivedate=2016-04-23 |work=Michael Paquier&lt;!-- skip this, as name already in, change to website url, or not, as seems down..?--&gt; - Open source developer based in Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Katz|first1=Jonathan S.|title=Range Types: Your Life Will Never Be The Same|url=https://wiki.postgresql.org/images/7/73/Range-types-pgopen-2012.pdf|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PostgreSQL range types are supported by numerous native operators and functions.
* [[Teradata]] provides two products. Teradata version 13.10 and [[Teradata#Teradata Database 14|Teradata version 14]] have temporal features based on TSQL2&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kateb, Mohammed et al.  "[http://www.edbt.org/Proceedings/2013-Genova/papers/edbt/a51-al-kateb.pdf Temporal Query Processing in Teradata]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}".  EDBT/ICDT ’13 March 18–22, 2013, Genoa, Italy&lt;/ref&gt; built into the database.
* [[IBM DB2]] version 10 added a feature called "time travel query"&lt;ref name="DB2"&gt;http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/dm-1204db2temporaldata/&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on the temporal capabilities of the [[SQL:2011]] standard.&lt;ref name="SQL2011"&gt;Kulkarni, Krishna, and Jan-Eike Michels.

* [[Microsoft SQL Server]] introduced Temporal Tables as a feature for SQL Server 2016. The feature is described in a video on Microsoft's "Channel 9" web site.&lt;ref name ="SQLServerVideo"&gt;http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Data-Exposed/Temporal-in-SQL-Server-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-relational, NoSQL database management systems that provide temporal features including the following:
* [[MarkLogic]] introduced bitemporal data support in version 8.0. Time stamps for Valid and System time are stored in JSON or XML documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bridgwater|first1=Adrian|title=Data Is Good, 'Bidirectionalized Bitemporal' Data Is Better|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2014/11/24/data-is-good-bidirectionalized-bitemporal-data-is-better/#5424ff9b567b |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ultraluminous X-ray source''' ('''ULX''') is an astronomical source of [[X-rays]] that is less luminous than an [[active galactic nucleus]] but is more consistently luminous than any known stellar process (over 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; [[erg]]/s, or 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; [[watt]]s), assuming that it radiates [[isotropy|isotropically]] (the same in all directions). Typically there is about one ULX per galaxy in galaxies which host them, but some galaxies contain many. The [[Milky Way]] has not been shown to contain a ULX. The main interest in ULXs stems from their luminosity exceeding the [[Eddington luminosity]] of [[neutron stars]] and even [[stellar black hole]]s. It is not known what powers ULXs; models include beamed emission of stellar mass objects, [[accretion (astrophysics)|accreting]] [[intermediate-mass black hole]]s, and super-Eddington emission.

==Observational facts==
ULXs were first discovered in the 1980s by the [[Einstein Observatory]]. Later observations were made by [[ROSAT]]. Great progress has been made by the X-ray observatories [[XMM-Newton]] and [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]], which have a much greater [[spectral resolution|spectral]] and [[angular resolution]]. A survey of ULXs by [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] observations shows that there is approximately one ULX per galaxy in galaxies which host ULXs (most do not).&lt;ref name="swartz04"&gt;

ULXs are found in all types of galaxies, including [[elliptical galaxies]] but are more ubiquitous in [[Galaxy formation and evolution|star-forming galaxies]] and in gravitationally interacting galaxies. Tens of percents of ULXs are in fact background [[quasars]]; the probability for a ULX to be a background source is larger in [[elliptical galaxies]] than in [[spiral galaxies]].

==Models==
The fact that ULXs have Eddington luminosities larger than that of stellar mass objects implies that they are different from normal [[X-ray binaries]]. There are several models for ULXs, and it is likely that different models apply for different sources.

'''Beamed emission''' — If the emission of the sources is strongly beamed, the Eddington argument is circumvented twice: first because the actual [[luminosity]] of the source is lower than inferred, and second because the accreted gas may come from a different direction than that in which the [[photons]] are emitted. Modelling indicates that stellar mass sources may reach luminosities up to 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s (10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; W), enough to explain most of the sources, but too low for the most luminous sources. If the source is stellar mass and has a [[thermal]] [[spectrum]], its [[temperature]] should be high, temperature times the [[Boltzmann constant]] ''kT'' ≈ 1 keV, and [[quasi-periodic oscillations]] are not expected.

'''Intermediate-mass black holes''' — [[Black holes]] are observed in nature with masses of the order of ten times the mass of the [[Sun]], and with masses of millions to billions the solar mass. The former are '[[stellar black hole]]s', the end product of massive stars, while the latter are [[supermassive black hole]]s, and exist in the centers of galaxies. [[Intermediate-mass black hole]]s (IMBHs) are a hypothetical third class of objects, with masses in the range of hundreds to thousands of solar masses.&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David|authorlink=David Merritt|title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|date=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9781400846122|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intermediate-mass black holes are light enough not to sink to the center of their host galaxies by [[dynamical friction]], but sufficiently massive to be able to emit at ULX luminosities without exceeding the [[Eddington limit]]. If a ULX is an intermediate-mass black hole, in the high/soft state it should have a thermal component from an accretion disk peaking at a relatively low temperature (''kT''&amp;nbsp;≈ 0.1 keV) and it may exhibit quasi-periodic oscillation at relatively low [[frequencies]].

An argument made in favor of some sources as possible IMBHs is the analogy of the X-ray spectra as scaled-up stellar mass black hole X-ray binaries.  The spectra of X-ray binaries have been observed to go through various transition states.  The most notable of these states are the low/hard state and the high/soft state (see Remillard &amp; McClintock 2006). The low/hard state or power-law dominated state is characterized by an absorbed power-law X-ray spectrum with spectral index from 1.5 to 2.0 (hard X-ray spectrum). Historically, this state was associated with a lower luminosity, though with better observations with satellites such as RXTE, this is not necessarily the case.  The high/soft state is characterized by an absorbed thermal component (blackbody with a disk temperature of (''kT''&amp;nbsp;≈ 1.0 keV) and power-law (spectral index&amp;nbsp;≈ 2.5). At least one ULX source, Holmberg II X-1, has been observed in states with spectra characteristic of both the high and low state.  This suggests that some ULXs may be accreting IMBHs (see Winter, Mushotzky, Reynolds 2006).

'''Background [[quasars]]''' — A significant fraction of observed ULXs are in fact background sources. Such sources may be identified by a very low temperature (e.g. the soft excess in PG quasars).

'''[[Supernova]] remnants''' — Bright supernova (SN) remnants may perhaps reach luminosities as high as 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s (10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; W). If a ULX is a SN remnant it is not variable on short time-scales, and fades on a time-scale of the order of a few years.

==Notable ULXs==

*'''Holmberg II X-1''': This famous ULX resides in a dwarf galaxy. Multiple observations with XMM have revealed the source in both a low/hard and high/soft state, suggesting that this source could be a scaled-up X-ray binary or accreting IMBH.
*'''[[Messier 74|M74]]''': Possibly containing an [[intermediate-mass black hole]], as observed by Chandra in 2005.
*'''[[M82 X-1]]''': This is the most luminous known ULX (as of Oct 2004), and has often been marked as the best candidate to host an intermediate-mass black hole.&lt;ref name=" "&gt;

'''Wikispecies''' is a [[wiki]]-based online project supported by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Its aim is to create a comprehensive [[free content]] catalogue of all [[species]]; the project is directed at scientists, rather than at the general public. [[Jimmy Wales]] stated that editors are not required to [[fax]] in their degrees, but that submissions will have to pass muster with a technical audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Calling all taxonomists |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=307 |issue=5712 |pages=1021 |doi=10.1126/science.307.5712.1021a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiSpecies |newspaper=[[American Scientist|American Scientist Online]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430034914/http://www.americanscientist.org/template/SiteOfTheWeekTypeDetail/assetid/43122 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/template/SiteOfTheWeekTypeDetail/assetid/43122 |archivedate=30 April 2005 |date=25 April 2005 |publisher=Sigma Xi |accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikispecies is available under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] and [[Creative Commons licenses|CC BY-SA 3.0]].

Started in September 2004, with [[biologist]]s across the world invited to contribute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|first=Mark |last=Peplow |year=2005 |title=Species list reaches half-million mark |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/news050314-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project had grown a framework encompassing the [[Linnaean taxonomy]] with links to [[Wikipedia]] articles on individual species by April 2005.&lt;ref name=AS /&gt;

== History ==
[[:species:User:Benedikt|Benedikt Mandl]] co-ordinated the efforts of several people who are interested in getting involved with the project and contacted potential supporters in early summer 2004. Databases were evaluated and the administrators contacted, some of them have agreed on providing their data for Wikispecies. Mandl defined two major tasks:
# Figure out how the contents of the data base would need to be presented—by asking experts, potential non-professional users and comparing that with existing databases
# Figure out how to do the software, which hardware is required and how to cover the costs—by asking experts, looking for fellow volunteers and potential sponsors

Advantages and disadvantages were widely discussed by the wikimedia-I mailing list. The board of directors of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] voted by 4 to 0 in favor of the establishment of a Wikispecies. The project was launched in August 2004 and is hosted at species.wikimedia.org. It was officially merged to a sister project of Wikimedia Foundation on September 14, 2004.
* On October 10, 2006, the project exceeded 75,000 articles.
* On May 20, 2007, the project exceeded 100,000 articles with a total of 5,495 registered users.
* On September 8, 2008, the project exceeded 150,000 articles with a total of 9,224 registered users.
* On October 23, 2011, the project reached 300,000 articles.
* On June 16, 2014, the project reached 400,000 articles.
* On January 7, 2017, the project reached 500,000 articles.
* On October 30, 2018, the project reached 600,000 articles, and a total of 1.12 million pages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics Wikispecies statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikispecies comprises taxon pages, and additionally pages about synonyms, taxon authorities, taxonomical publications, and institutions or repositories holding type specimen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://species.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikispecies:Page_types Wikispecies psge types]&lt;/ref&gt;
