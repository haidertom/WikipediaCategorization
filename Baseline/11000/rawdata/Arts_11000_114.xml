{{Original research|date=November 2009}}
'''Airport novel(s)''' represent a [[literary genre]] that is not so much defined by its [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] or cast of [[stock character]]s, as much as it is by the social function it serves.  An airport novel is typically a fairly long but fast-paced [[novel]] of intrigue or adventure that is stereotypically found in the reading fare offered by [[airport]] [[newsstand]]s.

Considering the marketing of fiction as a trade, airport novels occupy a niche similar to the one that once was occupied by [[pulp magazine]] fiction and other reading materials typically sold at newsstands and [[kiosk]]s to travellers.  This pulp fiction is one obvious source for the genre; sprawling [[historical novel]]s of exotic adventure such as those by [[James A. Michener|James Michener]] and [[James Clavell]] are another source.  In [[French language|French]], such novels are called ''romans de gare'', "[[train station|railway station]] novels",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Romans de gare|work=Harper-Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=Harper-Collins|date= 2007|isbn= 978-0-00-728044-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that writers in France were aware of this potential market at an even earlier date.&lt;ref name="Sweeney, Seamus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000327.php |title=A New Genre: The Record Store Book|website=The Social Affairs Unit|author=Sweeney, Seamus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The somewhat dated, Dutch term 'stationsroman' is a [[calque]] from French.

==Meeting the reading needs of travelers==
An airport novel must necessarily be superficially engaging, while not being particularly profound or philosophical, or at least, without such content being necessary for enjoyment of the book. The reader is not a person alone, in a quiet setting, contemplating deep thoughts or savouring fine writing; the reader is being jostled and penned among strangers, and seeks distraction from the boredom and inconveniences of travel. Similarly, the reader is not in a position to consult reference works, scholarly papers, or the author's previous works. The writer of an airport novel must meet the needs of readers in this situation.

The realisation that this niche market for [[mass market paperback]]s had given rise to a new genre was slow in coming. Perhaps a defining moment in the history of the genre came in 1968, when [[Arthur Hailey]] published ''[[Airport (novel)|Airport]]'', an airport novel that used the commercial flight industry to frame an adventure yarn about a disaster in an airport.&lt;ref name="Fear of Flying"&gt;Sarah Vowell, [http://www.salon.com/ent/music/vowe/1998/08/24vowe.html ''Fear of Flying''] at salon.com, byline Aug. 24, 1998, accessed Mar. 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Hailey's other novels, [[soap opera]] tales with complex plots of adultery and intrigue featuring business characters, using a number of other industries as backdrops (e.g. ''[[The Final Diagnosis]]'' ([[hospital]]s); ''[[Hotel (novel)|Hotel]]'' ([[hotel]]s);  ''[[Wheels (novel)|Wheels]]'' ([[automobile]] industry); ''[[The Moneychangers]]'' ([[banking]]) represented an emerging genre.

==Format==
{{Original research|date=May 2010}}
{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}
Airport novels are always [[paperback book]]s of a small but thick format. These books are often printed on inexpensive [[newsprint]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Their titles are often printed in a gilded, silvery or vividly scarlet finish, which more often than not starts very quickly to dissolve and stick to the reader's fingertips. This is not a problem for their intended purpose; they are made to be bought on impulse, and their readers often discard them when finished.

Airport novels are typically quite long books; a book that a reader was able to finish before the journey was done would similarly be unsatisfying.  Because of this length, the genre attracts prolific authors, who use their output as a sort of [[brand]]ing; each author is identified with a certain sort of story, and produces many variations of the same thing.  Well-known authors' names are usually in type larger than the title on the covers of airport novels, often in [[Embossing (paper)|embossed]] letters.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cathcart, ''[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/atoday/stories/s153446.htm Airport art: what is it?]''.  [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], byline July 17, 2000, accessed Mar. 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Airport novels typically fall within a number of other [[genre fiction|fictional genres]], including:

* [[Crime fiction]]
* [[Detective fiction]]
* [[Historical romance]]
* [[Spy fiction]]
* [[Thriller (genre)|Thriller]]s

Whatever the genre, the books must be fast-paced and easy to read.  The description "airport novel" is mildly [[pejorative]]; it implies that the book has little lasting value, and is useful chiefly as an inexpensive form of entertainment during travel.  Airport novels are sometimes contrasted with [[literary fiction]]; so that a novel with literary aspirations would be disparaged by the label.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Kulakauskas, [http://www.illiterarty.com/genre-airport-novel Genre: ''Airport novel''] at illiterarty.com, no date; accessed Mar. 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Avenue of Chestnut Trees at La Celle-Saint-Cloud''''' (French - ''Allée de châtaigniers à La Celle-Saint-Cloud'') or  '''''Edge of the Fontainebleau Forest''''' (''Lisière de la forêt de Fontainebleau'') is an 1865 pre-[[Impressionist]] painting by [[Alfred Sisley]], produced in the woods at [[La Celle-Saint-Cloud]]. It was refused by the [[Paris Salon]] of 1867 and bought by [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]] in 1877. It was acquired in 1919 by [[Joseph Duveen]], who in 1921 gave it to the [[Petit Palais]], where it still hangs.

The '''British Shakespeare Company''' was a British open-air touring [[Shakespeare]] Company.   Founded by Robert J. Williamson in 1994 (as the '''R. J. Williamson Company'''), it was renamed in 2005.  Originally based in [[Leeds]] (performing in the ruins of [[Kirkstall Abbey]]), the company later established Shakespeare festivals for [[Brighton]], [[Nottingham]], The [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew Gardens]], [[Cannizaro Park]] in Wimbledon and [[Holland Park Theatre]] in central London.

The company produced two of Shakespeare's most commercially popular plays each year from 1994 to 2007, totalling over 700 performances, usually featuring household names from film, television and stage. These have included [[James Alexandrou]] from ''[[EastEnders]]'', [[Pierce Brosnan]]'s actor son Sean, the dancer and performer [[Wayne Sleep]], and the comedian [[Norman Pace]]. The 2007 shows, ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' and ''[[As You Like It]]'' toured Norway, Windsor, Leeds and Oxford. In 2008 the company performed ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' for two nights at [[Arundel Castle]].

The company's last tour in 2009 starred [[Mark Arden]], [[Louisa Lytton]], [[Daniela Lavender]], [[David Davies (actor)|David Davies]], [[Gabriel Thomson]], [[Steven Blakeley]] and Robert J. Williamson. The company performed ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''. This was the BSC's largest tour, commencing at the [[Rose Theatre, Kingston]], [[Trinity College, Dublin]], Ramme Gaard in Norway, before visiting [[Gawsworth Hall]] in Cheshire, [[Norwich Cathedral]], [[Kentwell Hall]] in Suffolk, [[Kirkstall Abbey]] in Leeds, Burgrave Palace in [[Prague]], Sterts Theatre in Cornwall and [[Arundel Castle]] in West Sussex.  Since this tour there has been no further activity by the company.

From 2006, when the company began performing at [[Ramme Gaard]], an ecological estate with an outdoor [[amphitheatre]] on the coast of [[Norway]], the Norwegian billionaire and philanthropist [[Petter Olsen]] was its patron.

[[File:Hanging Church.jpg|thumb|[[Pulpit]] and section of [[iconostasis]] inside [[The Hanging Church]] in Cairo]]
[[File:StMarkCathAlex.jpg|thumb|right|St. Mark Coptic Cathedral in Alexandria]]
'''Coptic architecture''' is the [[architecture]] of the [[Copt]]s, who form the majority of [[Christianity in Egypt|Christians]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/History/Coptic/080500000000000001.htm Egypt state info]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coptic churches range from great [[cathedral]]s such as [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral]] to the smallest churches in rural villages. Many ancient monasteries like [[Monastery of Saint Anthony]] also exist. Ancient churches like the [[Hanging Church]] in [[Coptic Cairo]] carry important historical value to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] and the Copts in general.

==Origin and influence==
[[File:Kairo Hanging Church BW 1.jpg|thumb|left|The Hanging Church is Cairo's most famous [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] church first built in the 3rd or 4th century]]
{{copts}} 
Some authorities trace the origins of Coptic architecture to [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]], seeing a similarity between the plan of ancient [[Egyptian temples]], progressing from an outer courtyard to a hidden inner [[sanctuary]] to that of Coptic churches, with an outer [[narthex]] or porch, and (in later buildings) a sanctuary hidden behind an [[iconostasis]]. Others see the earliest Coptic churches as progressing, like those of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] churches, from the Graeco-Roman [[basilica]]. The ruins of the [[cathedral]] at [[Hermopolis Magna]] (c.430–40) are the major survival of the single brief period when the Coptic Orthodox Church represented the official religion of the state in Egypt.

Thus, from its early beginnings Coptic architecture fused indigenous Egyptian building traditions and materials with Graeco-Roman and Christian Byzantine styles. The fertile styles of neighbouring Christian [[Syria]] had a greatly increased influence after the 6th century, including the use of stone [[tympanum (architecture)|tympani]].&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Atroshenko and Judith Collins, ''The Origins of the Romanesque'', p. 120, Lund Humphries, London, 1985, {{ISBN|0-85331-487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a period of two thousand years, Coptic architecture incorporated native [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Graeco-Roman]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and Western European styles.

After the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], the influence of Coptic art and architecture on Egyptian Islamic architecture and the incorporation of some Coptic features in Islamic building in Egypt can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0018814.html Tiscali]&lt;/ref&gt; This can be explained by the fact that the early Muslim rulers of Egypt, much like the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] and Byzantine rulers before them, recruited native [[Egyptians]] to undertake the building labor. In later centuries, Coptic art and architecture also incorporated motifs inspired by Islamic styles.&lt;ref&gt;Kamil, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, very early examples of the pointed arch appear in Coptic churches from the 4th century onwards, and this became a notable feature of [[Islamic architecture]], and may have spread from there to European [[Gothic architecture]], though this whole area remains controversial among architectural historians, with many now seeing the origins among the [[Assyria]]ns, from whom it spread to [[Persia]], where it joined the Islamic style.&lt;ref&gt;See: "Arch (pointed)", in ''A Concise Dictionary of Architecture''; Frederic Hicks Jones; 1991; Thomson Crisp Learning, {{ISBN|1-56052-066-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] broke from the other [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es in 451 AD. After that date, the Copts, then a great majority of the Egyptian population, were shunned and often persecuted by their Byzantine rulers until the conquest of Egypt by Islam, after which the slowly declining Coptic population was in a rather precarious position. Coptic architecture therefore lacked the lavish patronage of rulers and the Court, which was directly responsible for most of the important buildings of Byzantine and medieval Catholic architecture. Most buildings are small, conservative in design, and remain closer to vernacular styles. They also have a tendency to massive construction, which is partly a surviving Egyptian taste from the Pharaonic period, partly reflects the need to semi-fortify buildings, partly is an inevitable result of [[mudbrick]] construction of large structures, and is also partly to keep them cool in the Egyptian climate.

Well before the break of 451, Egyptian Christianity had pioneered [[monasticism]], with many  communities being established in deliberately remote positions, especially in Southern Egypt. The relatively large number of buildings surviving from the early periods of monasticism, from about the 5th century onwards, are one of the most important groups of early Christian buildings to remain, and offer a useful corrective to the Court art of [[Ravenna]] or [[Constantinople]]. Many very early wall-paintings also survive. Even the ruins of monasteries in many places have survived in a good enough condition to impress the visitor and inform the art historian. Early Coptic architecture is therefore of great importance in the study of Early Christian architecture in general.
[[File:Assouan cathedrale copte.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Archangel Michael's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in [[Aswan]]]]

Despite the break with the other churches, aspects of the development of the arrangement of Coptic churches have paralleled those in Orthodoxy, such as the emergence of a solid [[iconostasis]] to separate the [[sanctuary]], and the West, such as the movement over the centuries of the place of baptism from the [[narthex]] or outer porch into the rear of the nave. However the existence of three altars in the sanctuary, sometimes in separate [[apse]]s, is typically and distinctively Coptic. The altars themselves are always free-standing.

Especially between the Muslim conquest and the 19th century, the external facade of Coptic urban churches is usually plain and discreet, as is the roof-line. Equally the monasteries were often enclosed with high blank walls to defend them from desert raiders during the Middle Ages. However, internally the churches can be ornately decorated, although monumental sculpture of holy figures is avoided as in Orthodoxy.
 
Many Coptic monasteries and churches scattered throughout Egypt are built of [[mudbrick]] on the basilica plan inherited from Graeco-Roman architectural styles. They usually have heavy walls and columns, [[architrave]]s and barrel-vaulted roofs, and end in a tripartite [[apse]], but many variant plans exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/churchtypology.htm|title=Typology of Ancient Egyptian Christian Churches|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domes are small compared to Byzantine churches, and from the 10th-century naves are often roofed with domed [[cupola]]s. The dome raised on a circular supporting wall, which is so characteristic of later [[Byzantine architecture]], is rarely used. Massive timber is often used across the nave, sometimes to support a flat roof, and sometimes to give structural strength to the walls. Inside the churches are richly decorated with [[fresco]]ed murals and reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575254/Coptic_Art_and_Architecture.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwRLzdm8?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575254/Coptic_Art_and_Architecture.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconostasis==
[[File:17112007051.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Example of modern Coptic Iconostasis of at [[St Mary and St Mercurius Coptic Orthodox Church]] in [[Wales]]]]
The screen known as the [[iconostasis]] separating the sanctuary from the main body of the church is one of the main features of any Coptic church. The Coptic iconostasis is usually less completely composed of [[icon]]s than the Eastern Orthodox one, although there will always be several. It is very often an open-work screen, usually made of [[ebony]] and sometimes inlaid with ivory like that in [[Saint Mary Church (Harat Zewila)]].  These may be in geometrical patterns comparable to the secular screens which are a feature of traditional Egyptian houses.

The [[iconostasis]] of Saint Mary Church in Harat Zewila in [[Old Cairo]], rebuilt after 1321, shows the mixture of stylistic elements in Coptic architecture. The basic plan is that of the [[basilica]], and recycled ancient columns are used. The older woodwork is Islamic in style, as are the [[Muqarnas]] in the [[pendentive]]s, and a Gothic revival [[rood]] cross surmounts the iconostasis. This uses Islamic abstract motifs, which is also common. Some screens are pierced rather than solid.

There are many examples of Coptic iconostasis that predate the earliest surviving Eastern and Western counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUl6v71PXVoC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=coptic+iconostasis&amp;source=web&amp;ots=2XbjWhbwMx&amp;sig=cVpPHYsRvMH_iNx5xBGemEPPSw4|title=The Ancient Coptic Churches Of Egypt|last=Butler|first=Alfred J.|date=2004|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=9780766190078|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Khurus or Choir==
Between the 7th and 12th centuries, many churches were built or modified with a distinctive Coptic feature, the ''khurus'', a space running across the whole width of the church separating the ''naos'' or [[nave]] from the sanctuary, rather as the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] does in [[Gothic architecture]].
[[File:Archangel Michael's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, built in the Coptic style 2006-10-EGYPT-ASWAN.jpg|thumb|right|240x120px|Archangel Michael's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Aswan]]

==Decorative carving==
Early Coptic buildings contain elaborate and vigorous decorative carving on the capitals of columns, or friezes, some of which include [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]], confronted animals, and other motifs.  These are also related to Coptic [[illuminated manuscript]]s and fabrics, and are often regarded as significant influences both on early Islamic art, like the [[Mshatta facade]] and on the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles (which appears to have been in contact with Coptic monasteries).&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Honour and John Fleming, A World History of Art, 1982, Macmillan, London, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; From Insular art these motifs developed into European [[Romanesque art]].&lt;ref&gt;Atroshenko and Collins, op cit, p. 120-139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The architecture of many Coptic buildings remains poorly documented, as they become more at risk for abandonment, vandalism, and destruction. Time sensitive architectural and cultural research projects are awaiting initiation.

Examples of significant Coptic architecture include:
*Cathedral ruins at [[Hermopolis Magna]], built c. 430—440, in the [[Minya Governorate]] ([[Lower Egypt]]).
*The [[White Monastery]] and [[Red Monastery]], near [[Souhag]] in the [[Sohag Governorate]] ([[Middle Egypt]]), with buildings from the 5th century and onwards.
*The "[[Coptic Cairo|Coptic Cairo District]]" of [[Old Cairo]] (Lower Egypt), with numerous churches from the 7th century and onwards, including "[[The Hanging Church]]" and [[Saint Mary Church (Haret Elroum)|Saint Mary Church (''Haret Elroum'')]].
*The [[Deir el-Muharraq|Deir el-Muharraq monastery complex]] (the Burned Monastery), near [[El-Qusiya]] in the [[Asyut Governorate]] ([[Upper Egypt]]). Established in the 4th century, with a 6th-7th century fortress, and churches from the 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th centuries.

==Modern Coptic architecture==

European architectural styles began to influence Coptic churches in the eighteenth century. Examples of modern Coptic churches that have features of European churches are St. Mary (El Marashly) Church in [[Zamalek]], [[Cairo]] designed by famous Coptic architect [[Ramses Wissa Wassef]], other examples of modern Coptic architecture are the [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, Cairo]] consecrated in 1968 and [[Archangel Michael's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral Aswan]] consecrated in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copticpope.org/downloads/eng_keraza/engkeraza31-03-2006.pdf Elkeraza English] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305153931/http://www.copticpope.org/downloads/eng_keraza/engkeraza31-03-2006.pdf |date=2009-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coptic churches maintained the tradition of being built in the same shapes as older churches yet it is noticeable that modern Coptic churches are in general bigger than older ones.

The mark for the beginning of the revival of Coptic architecture was in the late eighteenth century by the building of the [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral (Azbakeya)|Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral]] in Azbakeya, Cairo, that became the seat of the Coptic Pope in 1800 A D.

Regulations preventing building new churches, which were put by the [[Ottomans]], were eased in the following years by the rulers of Egypt; allowing many churches to be rebuilt and new churches were also permitted after more than three hundred years of prevention.

Many of the rebuilt churches carried the old features of the Coptic architecture with the addition of modern features.

'''Eileen Barnes''' (1876–1956) was a notable and highly acclaimed botanical artist, well known for her definitive and accurate depictions of Ireland's plant life.&lt;ref name="Lucey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lucey|first1=John|title=Eileen Barnes (1876–1956): the contributions of a gifted artist, scientific illustrator and model-maker to Irish natural history|journal=Irish Naturalists' Journal|year=2015|volume=34|issue=2|pages=113–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Patricia|title=Irish Botanical Illustrators &amp; Flower Painters|date=2000|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Suffolk|isbn=9781851493579|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Eileen Barnes was born in 1876 in her parent's home at 137 Great Britain Street (now [[Parnell Street]]), Dublin. She was the youngest child of Edwin and Elizabeth Barnes (née McKay). Her father was a grocer and wine merchant who had premises on Great Britain Street and at 57 [[Camden Street, Dublin|Camden Street]]. Barnes attended Rutland School for Girls in Dublin, going on to enrol in the [[Dublin Metropolitan School of Art]] in 1898 and 1899. She appears to have received an Art Teacher's Certificate in 1899. Immediately after leaving the School of Art Barnes worked as a governess in [[County Tipperary]], teaching the two daughters of Anna Maria Cooper-Chadwick.&lt;ref name="Lucey" /&gt;

==Career==
She spent most of her career working with the [[National Museum of Ireland]]'s natural history and antique's division, helping the naturalist [[Robert Lloyd Praeger]] and botanist [[Matilda Knowles]], as well as creating models for the museum's exhibits.&lt;ref name="Proffitt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Creese|first1=Mary R. S.|last2=Creese|first2=Thomas M.|title=Ladies in the Laboratory 2|date=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0810849798|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her association with the [[Natural History Museum (Ireland)|Natural Museum]] in Dublin appears to have begun in 1907, when she is recorded as donating models of the eggs of a platypus. By 1909 she appears to be working in the museum, setting up exhibition cases, constructing models of natural habitats, and wax models. Many of these examples, such as the rock pool and mammal displays that are still exhibited on the ground floor of the Natural History Museum, are believed to be her work. Her formal position within the Museum is unclear, with her at times being referred to as a staff member or the "Museum Artist".&lt;ref name="Lucey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Desmond|first1=Ray|title=Dictionary of British And Irish Botantists And Horticulturalists Including plant collectors, flower painters and garden designers|date=1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=0850668433|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes illustrated [[cephalopod]]a for [[Annie Massy]], such as those collected by the 1910-1913 British Antarctic expedition. She undertook similar illustration work for the sponge expert, [[Jane Stephens]], illustrating a number of her publications. She also illustrated the [[Foraminifera]] collected during the [[Clare Island Survey]].&lt;ref name="Lucey" /&gt; Her work was highly regarded by Praeger, who even went as far as to name one of his plants after her (''Sedum barnesianum'').&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Barnes' works have been featured in numerous books and monographs, and still highly regarded today, especially her ''sedums'' ([[stonecrop]]s) and ''sempervivums'' ([[house leek]]s).&lt;ref name="Proffitt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Proffitt|first=Pamela|title=Notable Woman Scientists|date=1999|publisher=Gale Group Inc.|location=27500 Drake Rd., Farmington Hills, MI 48331-3535|isbn=0-7876-3900-1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked with [[Robert Francis Scharff]] to reconstruct and illustrate specimens of the [[Giant Irish deer]]. Barnes also undertook some cartographic work with the [[Geological Survey of Ireland]], and restoration of archaeological artefacts from the [[Royal Irish Academy]].&lt;ref name="Lucey" /&gt; She also assisted [[Mary Eily de Putron]] when she was working at the museum.

Barnes was a member of the Dublin Naturalists' Field Club from 1913. It is believed she collected specimens of [[lichen]], with one specimen found in the herbarium of the Irish [[National Botanic Gardens (Ireland)]].&lt;ref name="Lucey" /&gt;

==Later life and death==
Barnes retired from her work with the Museum at some point after March 1947, though continued to restore artefacts on behalf of the Museum into the 1950s. She lived with her mother and siblings until their deaths. None of her five siblings who reached adulthood married, meaning that Barnes had no close family when she died in 1956. Neither Barnes birth or death was officially registered, with her date of death remaining undocumented until 2015. She was admitted to [[Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital]] on 13 February 1956, undergoing an operation to "extensive burns" on 27 February. She later died on 12 March, and was buried alongside her siblings Herbert and Edith on 14 March 1956.&lt;ref name="Lucey" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2562">'''Fronte Nuovo delle Arti''' was an Italian artistic movement active in [[Venice]], [[Rome]] and [[Milan]] in the years following [[Second World War|WWII]] (1946 to 1950). It is considered to be part of the post-cubism movement.

"Fronte Nuovo delle Arti" was founded in September-October 1946 with the name ''Nuova Secessione Artistica Italiana'' (New Italian Artistic Secession). The first manifesto was published on 1 October 1946 in [[Venice]]. It was written by Giuseppe Marchiori and signed by [[Emilio Vedova]], [[Renato Birolli]], [[Ennio Morlotti]], [[Armando Pizzinato]], Giuseppe Santomaso, Alberto Viani, [[Bruno Cassinari]], [[Renato Guttuso]], Leoncillo Leonardi and [[Carlo Levi]]. Later on, Guttuso proposed to change the name of the movement to ''Fronte Nuovo delle Arti''. 

The reasoning for this group of artists and critics to develop the ideas leading to the formation of the ''Fronte'' was to go beyond the positions of the movement Novecento italiano, who were deemed as outdated in light of the most recent artistic developments in Europe. 

"Fronte Nuovo delle Arti'' had a number of exhibitions in Italy but it disbanded after an intense internal debate about [[Abstract art|abstraction]] and [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. Pizzinato and Guttuso rejected [[abstractionism]] and announced their decision to quit. The movement was officially dissolved on 3 September 1950 in Venice.

The '''Gesellschaft zur Verfolgung von Urheberrechtsverletzungen e.V.''' (GVU, Society for the Prosecution of Copyright Infringement) is a registered association under German law. According to its own description it works for the [[Video game industry|game]] and [[film industry]] and helps to protect [[intellectual property]] and to counter the illegal distribution of [[Copyright infringement|copied materials]]. For this purpose, the association cooperates with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mpaa.org/about/around-the-world | title = Around the World | publisher = Motion Picture Association of America | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GVU was founded in the spring of 1984 and entered the register of associations in February 1985 for the first time. The headquarters were located first in [[Hamburg]], since 2008 they have been in [[Mitte (locality)|Berlin-Mitte]]. The GVU became known to a wider public by participating in campaigns such as "pirates are criminals“ and investigations in the Kino.to case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = European Police Shut Down Internet Pirate Kino.to | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/european-police-shut-down-internet-196223 | publisher = The Hollywood Reporter | author = Scott Roxborough | date = 2011-08-06 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:ZentraleGVU.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Headquarters in Berlin (Quarter Mitte)]]

=== Early Years ===
Against the backdrop of a rapidly increasing demand for movies on [[VHS]] and an increase in [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] at the same time, film industry representatives agreed in early 1984 to set up a separate company to combat illegal distribution of [[copyright]]ed material. The decision was primarily driven by the motivation of the industry, to detach from the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI). The longtime chairman of the Bundesverband Audiovisuelle Medien (BVV, Federal Association of Audiovisual Media) and Managing Director of the German subsidiary of [[Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment]], Bodo Schwartz, was key in the establishment of GVU.

The establishment of the GVU as a [[Business entity|legally registered association]] was formally announced in the autumn of 1984 at the [[High fidelity|HiFi]] trade fair in Düsseldorf. The first constitution was adopted on December 17, 1984. It first entered the register of the city of Hamburg on February 27, 1985, finalising the establishment of the association on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.handelsregister.de/rp_web/welcome.do?language=en | title = Common register portal of the German federal states | publisher = Amtsgericht Hagen | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next to Bodo Schwartz, Paul Miller of the [[Cinema International Corporation]] (CIC) and Manfred Goller of the Verband der Filmverleiher (VDF, Association of Film Distributors) were members of the founding board.

=== Software Era ===

After exclusive funding of the GVU by the movie industry in its initial years, the organisations range of tasks expanded in 1997 to include [[PC game|computer games]]. On the one hand this was due to the parallels between illegal copies of films and games - both in the production and distribution - and on the other hand, the simpler distribution of unauthorized material over the emerging [[Internet]]. [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]’s membership of the GVU in 1997 initiated the membership of the entire Entertainment Software Association in the GVU in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/241.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807142341/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/241.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-07 |title=Milestones of our Work |publisher=GVU |date=2007-04-03 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |format=PDF |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Microsoft]] entered the GVU as the first member of the [[software industry]], which represented a significant milestone for the work of the GVU and directed the attention of the general public to the association. Simultaneously, this resulted in an expansion of the range of GVU’s tasks. As early as in 2001, the GVU took over the [[Management|administration]] of the organization SAFE, which is responsible for the fight against [[copyright infringement]] in [[Switzerland]]. At the same time, cooperation intensified with the [[Austria]]n Verein für Anti-Piraterie (VAP, Association for Anti-Piracy) in the film and video industry, so the entire [[German language|German-speaking]] area was fully covered.

=== Management ===

The statutes of the GVU provides that the [[Vorstand|board]] consists of a chairman and at least three others. The GVU is represented jointly by at least two board members. Currently (as of November 2012) the committee includes Vincent de La Tour (Chairman), Dr. Holger Ensslin, Violetta Psofiou, Ralph Tübben, Alexander Skipis and Dr. Bernd Fakesch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/17_Impressum.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130211040202/http://www.gvu.de/17_Impressum.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-11 |title=Imprint on the Official Website |publisher=GVU |language=German |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[List of company registers|Commercial Register]] there are committees for finance, legal and technology. Next to the executive board the association has a full-time [[general manager|executive director]] who is responsible for the daily operations and reports to the Board. Dr. Matthias Leonardy currently holds this position, who previously worked as a [[Syndic|general counsel]] for the German [[eBay]] Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.linkedin.com/pub/matthias-leonardy/0/668/a40 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121225201307/http://de.linkedin.com/pub/matthias-leonardy/0/668/a40 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-25 |title=Professional Profile of Matthias Leonardy |publisher=LinkedIn |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work and structure of the GVU was mainly characterized by Bodo Schwartz, who was on the executive board for over 20 years and led it as Chairman for a long time. He also represented the GVU to media and shaped the image of the association in the public, including through various interviews. Schwartz retired from his position of CEO of [[Twentieth Century Fox]] in 2002, and retired from the GVU in October 2006. His retirement speech in late January 2007 was held by [[Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Speech at the New Year Reception of the GVU | date = 2009-08-25 | accessdate = 2011-12-23 | language = German | publisher = FDP Bayern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==

In 2011, a total of about 50 companies and organizations were represented as a member of the GVU. In the field of film this includes virtually all major [[Hollywood]] studios, such as [[Sony Pictures]], [[Twentieth Century Fox]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.]] and [[The Walt Disney Studios (production company)|Walt Disney Studios]]. Members from the gaming industry include [[Ubisoft]], Microsoft, [[Activision]], [[Konami]] and [[Koch Media]] as well as respective affiliates of the major film studios. In addition, in its Annual Report 2011, the service providers [[arvato]], [[Cinram]], [[OpSec]] and [[Rovi]] got quoted as members.&lt;ref name="report2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/828.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907051457/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/828.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-07 |title=Annual Report 2011 |publisher=GVU |language=German |format=PDF |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special role is played by the membership of numerous [[Trade association|professional organizations]], in which the interests and positions of certain industries are bundled. So for example currently the [[Bundesverband Musikindustrie]] (BVMI, Federal Association of Music Industry), the [[Bundesverband Informationswirtschaft, Telekommunikation und neue Medien]] (BITKOM, German Association for Information Technology, Telecommunications and New Media) and the [[Bundesverband Interaktive Unterhaltungssoftware]] (BIU, Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software) belong to the GVU. The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), one of the foremost organizations against [[copyright infringement]] in the [[English language|English speaking world]], is a full member too.

Overall, in 2011, nine organizations, 21 films- and 15 games providers and five other companies supported the GVU. Over the last five years the number of members has remained largely constant. However, as a result of the economic and [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis]], the association lost some companies from the movie industry. The most prominent example in this case is the production and distribution company [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which in 2007 was still listed as a member of the GVU, but no longer in the following year. MGM went into administration in 2010 and withdrew from other industry associations.

Since 2007, the GVU has published annually a list of its members.&lt;ref name="report2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/408.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812185131/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/408.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-08-12 |title=Annual Report 2007 |publisher=GVU |format=PDF |language=German |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations and [[business|companies]] indirectly involved in the GVU through third-party associations are not explicitly listed in it.

&lt;/timeline&gt;

== Activities ==

The activities of the Association focuses on preventing economic losses of its members, resulting from unauthorized copying and its dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.din.de/sixcms_upload/media/2896/TMC_Leonardy.pdf |title=Digital IP Theft: What it is, its Economics and Effects – and then, what? |author=Matthias Leonardy |publisher=5th Transatlantic Market Conference |date=2011-11-02 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090428/http://www.din.de/sixcms_upload/media/2896/TMC_Leonardy.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GVU estimated the loss at several hundred million euros annually. In addition to those defined in the constitution, the association based its efforts primarily on copyright law.

=== Investigations ===

The association applies a large part of its resources to the actual detection of copyright infringements. The action is driven by the view that government agencies alone cannot monitor the entire [[Market (economics)|market]] for unlicensed content, which is why the GVU tries to fill this gap. The employees of the GVU, including former [[police officers]] and [[commissioners]], systematically scour the relevant sources of illegal copies, especially on the Internet. Unlike other organizations, by its own admission the GVU does not primarily aim at end-consumers, rather, it targets mainly the "big fishes". Besides those people who for example record a movie at the cinema or make copies from a computer game, these increasingly include the operators of so-called [[BitTorrent|Trackers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=German |url=http://www.gvu.de/26_Illegale_Kopien.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531164334/http://www.gvu.de/26_Illegale_Kopien.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-05-31 |title=Mission and Activities - Disseminating Illegal Copies |publisher=GVU |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GVU mainly focuses on large, internationally active [[Warez group|release groups]] where copyrighted products are reproduced and distributed systematically, especially for profit. In its work, the association - if possible - accesses to public registers, for example, to reveal the real people behind a [[Shell corporation|shell company]]. Due of their private-sector activity, the GVU may not identify IP addresses directly. Instead the association directs this as evidence to the relevant authorities. This is usually done as part of criminal procedure, which then leads to public prosecutorial investigations. Unless a criminal procedure is actually opened, an employee of the association often act as an [[expert witness]]. Not every [[complaint]] will automatically lead to a successful prosecution, for example the GVU had to make a total of three applications in the case of Kino.to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.netzwelt.de/news/87476-interview-gvu-war-bereits-dritte-strafantrag-gegen-kino-to.html | title = This was the third complaint against kino.to | publisher = Netzwelt | author = Markus Franz | date = 2011-07-10 | accessdate = 2011-12-23 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as it is known to date, the GVU does not claim [[damages]] from [[warez]] users according to civil law. Instead the association allows its members the freedom to make possible claims for losses incurred. However, the association engages in strongly communicating its legal opinion in individual cases. Particularly in cases related to so-called illegal [[streaming media|streaming]] of copied content, many legal assessments and opinions remain debatable.

=== Public Relations ===

In addition to its investigative activities the GVU does intensive public relations, which aims to raise awareness of copyright infringement. In the years 2009 to 2011 members of the association participated in nearly 100 events and reached about 2.000 participants through their [[Presentation|speeches]]. In addition, since the late 80s the GVU has offered seminars for police officers and prosecutors, where they can learn about the consequences of [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] as well as the activities of the association.

In 1990, the GVU launched a prevention program on the topic of [[holography]], a technology making it easier for [[retail]]ers and [[consumer]]s to identify unauthorized copied media. In addition, the association was known to a wider audience through the campaign "Pirates are criminals". This was produced by a subsidiary of the Central Association of German Film Theatres, where the GVU sits on the advisory board. During the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2006]] an action of the umbrella organization MPAA was supported by [[Pelé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2006/06/10/mpaa_enlists_football_legend_pel_in_piracy_fight | title = MPAA enlists football legend Pelé in piracy fight | author = James Delahunty | publisher = AfterDawn | date = 2006-06-10 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the GVU has performed annually the so-called ROOF-industry forum together with VAP and SAFE, which recently took place in the Kalkscheune venue in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://irights.info/blog/arbeit2.0/2011/11/22/5-dach-branchenforum-gvu-verkundet-neue-strategie-vielleicht/ | title = GVU announces new strategy - perhaps? | publisher = iRights | date = 2011-11-22 | accessdate = 2011-12-23 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the event, [[Jurist|lawyers]], representatives of the games and movie industries are brought together with trade associations and [[Advocacy group|other stakeholders]] under the slogan "prevention and education". In 2011, the study of digital content usage (short DCN study) received large attention, since it was the first to cover the specific uses of legal and illegal online content. The study was prepared by the GVU and the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (Federal Association of Music Industry) as well as the [[Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels]] (Association of German Book Trade).

=== Political Influence ===
Beside the main activities, GVU also gives advice to politicians and represents its interests there.&lt;ref name="report2011" /&gt; For example, the association - as well as others around the globe - requested a [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] warning. This should be presented to an Internet user as soon as it first wants to call a pirated copy, but this remains controversial in [[Germany]]. In the course of this particular position, the GVU criticized the [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Justice]]. Furthermore, the association has complained for years that in case of copyright infringement there is a right of access to Internet service providers, but this would fail due to the lack of storage of communication data ("web problem").

The GVU also calls to execute the missing third basket of the reform of copyright law at last. Likewise, the trend towards trivialisation of copyright infringement by individual politicians criticized repeatedly, most recently in an article by [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] and [[Paul van Dyk]] in TIME.

== Proceedings ==

The investigations conducted by the association were influenced by [[Technological change|technological progress]] over the years: After the beginning of the 80s the fight against pirated VHS tapes were in the spotlight, many prosecutions in the 90s and the following years related to the distribution of movies and games via [[Peer-to-Peer|P2P networks]]. Since 2010 streaming has taken an increasingly larger space.&lt;ref name="report2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/798.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128005349/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/798.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-11-28 |title=Annual Report 2009 |publisher=GVU |date=2011-11-22 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |format=PDF |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of cases opened in the years 2007 to 2011 fell from 576 to 204. The decrease is mainly due to the fact that since 2008 many [[State's attorney|prosecutors]] have focused on those investigations in which more than 200 [[Reproduction|copies]] of a work were produced. The GVU in its own words has adopted this trend and focuses its investigative activities increasingly on major cases.

In addition to the operations that stern directly from GVU investigations, the association supports those proceedings initiated by the relevant legal authorities. In addition, each year several proceedings are officially reported, which were initiated jointly by [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] and the GVU. About a quarter of all cases result in a [[Sentence (law)|verdict]] or penalty order.

=== Significant Cases ===

In recent years, the GVU has uncovered many release groups and other networks, some of which stand out because of their size or importance.  Especially if in the course of the investigation a [[Search and seizure|house search]] takes place, the respective cases and the activities of the association experienced increased media attention. Mentioned in the annual reports of the GVU important procedures include the following:

* In September 2007, 50 properties were searched simultaneously in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and [[Belgium]]. The aim of the objective, which was launched by the GVU project "autumn storms", was primarily to obtain evidence. According to media reports, a total of 60 [[Personal computer|computers]] and 15 [[Hard disk drive|hard drives]] were seized. The GVU itself evaluates the action a success, for example by "[[Keinohrhasen]]" was no unauthorized copy in circulation until 2007.&lt;ref name="report2007" /&gt;
* Also in the same year a person could be found who was responsible for the spread of so-called First seeding the first illegal version of "[[Spider-Man 3|Spiderman 3]]". The person was also senior member of a release group that was responsible for numerous other software [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]].
* In March 2008, a request by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] umbrella organization caused that the GVU has started investigations against the operator of an internet portal, that offered primarily latest films like "[[Rush Hour 3]]". In the course of the proceedings it became clear that behind the offer stood a broad network, which had connections to the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Australia]]. Following a criminal complaint of the GVU the [[Frankfurt]] [[Kriminalpolizei|Criminal Police]] confiscated ten servers of the group, which were hosted there in one [[data center|datacenter]].&lt;ref name="report2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/586.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230033113/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/586.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-12-30 |title=Annual Report 2008 |publisher=GVU |language=German |format=PDF |date=2009-11-16 |accessdate=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Earlier this year, the GVU acted against a Payserver-ring that gave users access to pirated copies for a fee. In this case 13 [[Byte|terabytes]] of data were provided for a total of more than 10,000 registered users. In addition the association led a criminal conduct against operators of so-called trackers in [[BitTorrent]] network.
* In the spring of 2009 this led to another spectacular lawsuit: After raids in [[Lüneburg]], [[Wolfenbüttel]] and [[Braunschweig]] three men were [[Detention (imprisonment)|arrested]], who ran a tracker with 24.500 copied movies, TV shows, games, audiobooks, [[eBook]]s, music and software. This was characterized particularly by the fact that every user had to pay a fee to access the tracker. In addition, extensive [[User guide|instructions]] were provided to make the access to pirate copies simply as possible for less experienced people too.&lt;ref name="report2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/653.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124112337/http://www.gvu.de/media/pdf/653.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-01-24 |title=Annual Report 2009 |publisher=GVU |format=PDF |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2012-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The annual report also points to another important event: In 2005, the Swiss organization SAFE had received a notice of information about a large Payserver ring. Since the physical location was in [[Germany]], the persecution was handed over to the local association. The GVU set a criminal complaint against the head of the server in 2009.
* In March 2010, the GVU presented a criminal complaint, which was directed against a [[projectionist]] from [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. The projectionist was one of the most active Cinegroups and procured high-quality pirated audio material for the production of pirated copies. The investigations of the association revealed that they were identical to the original material even to the audio [[watermark]]ing. The group ended their activities completely after the arrest of the projectionist.&lt;ref name="report2010" /&gt;
* Another complaint in the same year was directed against the streaming hosting clickandload on which more than 20 terabytes of pirated copies were provided. According to the GVU-investigation the platform was organized as far-flung release group and, in particular, those who provided an illegally copy, shared revenue from [[advertising]] on the [[Website|site]]. During the police investigation the portal was completely shut down. Against the relevant uploader clickandload also proceedings were initiated.

In the following years, the association wants especially to tackle the financing of "piracy". The aim of the operation is to prevent professional service of ad-funded websites with pirated works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvu.de/25_208_Alexander_Skipis_in_den_GVU_Vorstand_gewaehlt_Austrocknen_von_Finanzquellen_digitaler_Hehler_im_Jahr_2013_ein_Schwerpunktthema_der_GVU.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130206185156/http://www.gvu.de/25_208_Alexander_Skipis_in_den_GVU_Vorstand_gewaehlt_Austrocknen_von_Finanzquellen_digitaler_Hehler_im_Jahr_2013_ein_Schwerpunktthema_der_GVU.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-06 |title=In 2013, the GVU focuses on Financing of Piracy |publisher=GVU |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2012-12-06 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Platform Kino.to ===
[[File:KinoToScreenshot.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Message from the Criminal Police]]

The most important proceeding of the GVU in the last decade was against Kino.to. In June 2011 Kino.to was one of the 50 most visited sites in Germany and was thus well known to the general public. According to the film industry over 96 per cent of visitors were located in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. At Kino.to it was possible to view tens of thousands of videos via so-called Streams, including numerous high-quality [[Movie theater|movies]] and [[Television program|TV series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/229865/article.html | title = Police Shut Down German Movie-streaming Portal | author = Jeremy Kirk | publisher = PCWorld | date = 2011-06-09 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Kino.to has become available in March 2008, the GVU was determined to go against its backers. According to the GVU, the process was difficult, as those behind Kino.to had specifically concealed their [[Identity (social science)|identities]]. For example, the [[top-level domain]] [[.to]] was chosen, as the responsible authority in [[Tonga]] does not releases any information about the respective owners of domains. Only when the third formal complaint by the Association was reported to the authorities in Dresden on April 28, 2011, the desired outcome was achieved: In early June, in [[Police raid|raids]] across several [[Europe]]an countries, several persons were arrested who were directly involved in Kino.to - including the owner Dirk B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Police take down Kino.to in massive anti-piracy operation | url = http://www.techspot.com/news/44187-police-take-down-kinoto-in-massive-anti-piracy-operation.html | publisher = TechSpot | author = Emil Protalinski | date = 2011-06-10 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainly responsible for the success was the Integrierte Ermittlungseinheit Sachsen (INES, Integrated Detection Unit Saxony). During the course of process Kino.to was shut down on the suspicion of the backers forming a criminal organization and copyright infringement on an industrial scale. A message relating to the criminal investigation is now found at Kino.to. What is seen in the film industry as a major success fuelled huge criticisms by the majority of Kino.to users.

As a direct result of the closure of Kino.to, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] started an attack on the [[Web server]] of the GVU, which finally led to an overload and failure of the website. In addition under the name KinoX.to a portal got created which is a direct descendant of Kino.to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/german-piracy-site-kinoto-relaunches-210099 | title = German Piracy Site Kino.to Relaunches as KinoX.to | publisher = The Hollywood Reporter | author = Scott Roxborough | date = 2011-12-07 | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GVU has now also initiated an investigation into this portal. In addition, the association and authorities are investigating the [[Online advertising|advertising]] and marketing of Kino.to and KinoX.to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/video/anonymous-retaliates-against-kino-to-take-down/ |date=2011-06-09 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |title=Anonymous retaliates against Kino.to takedown |publisher=GigaOM |author=Janko Roettgers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203205442/http://gigaom.com/video/anonymous-retaliates-against-kino-to-take-down/ |archivedate=2012-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malware ==

A [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]], which had been discovered for the first time on 20 March 2012, used the [[logo]] of GVU without permission of the Association. It targets and infects PCs running Microsoft [[Windows XP]] or later versions and claims to have [[Ransomware|locked the PC]] on behalf of the GVU, as pirated content had been detected on it. In fact not a single file on the hard disk is checked; however the user is prompted to pay a fee in order to regain access to the computer. Usually, the requested amount is between 50 and 100 euros and is to be paid via [[paysafecard]] or (now defunct) [[Ukash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.2-spyware.com/remove-gvu-virus.html | title = Remove GVU Virus - Removal Instructions | publisher = 2Spyware | author = Ugnius Kiguolis | accessdate = 2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, numerous variants of the GVU Trojan are circulating purporting to be a program of the [[Federal Office for Information Security|Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik]] (BSI, Federal Office for Information Security) or the [[Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte]] (GEMA, Society for musical performing and mechanical reproduction rights). Due to the widespread use of the Trojan, in August 2012 the GVU released its first statement regarding the [[malware]], aimed in particular at the malware authors. It was speculated that the Trojan was written by operators of illegal streaming portals in order to open up new financial sources. The page KinoX.to which strongly resembles Kino.to was used for the mass dissemination of new variants of the malware according to GVU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gvu-blog.de/?p=427 |title=What Kinox has to do with the GVU Trojans? |publisher=GVU Blog |author=Christine Ehlers |date=2012-08-14 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817122054/http://www.gvu-blog.de/?p=427 |archivedate=2012-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

In January 2006 the GVU was itself under investigation. The state prosecution of [[Ellwangen]] accused the association of having promoted the illegal distribution of copyrighted material. As the accusation details the association had allegedly had financial dealings with an administrator of the so-called IOH server, over which numerous release groups had collected and distributed copied content. In addition, the association got accused of directly providing hardware for the operation of the server.

During the course of the investigation the business premises of the GVU in Hamburg, as well as the [[apartment|home]] of a senior employee, were searched. The GVU has officially confirmed the raid and, according to the authorities, made available all of the information. Due to the particular urgency of the case, the action gained widespread media attention. However, suspicions against the association have not been confirmed. The investigation has since halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.onlinekosten.de/news/artikel/19848/0/Razzia-Ermittlungen-gegen-die-GVU | title = Roundup: Investigation of the GVU | language = German | publisher = Onlinekosten | author = Volker Briegleb | date = 2006-01-24 | accessdate = 2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, during another investigation, the role of the GVU was criticised: The [[Kiel]] District Court said that during the course of proceedings against a suspected software pirates, it is essential to ensure the independence of police investigative work. Specifically, there were complaints that an employee of the GVU had worked as an expert in the process and at the same time had a free hand in the analysis of seized computers. The requirement of impartiality, not only for [[judge]]s but also for prosecutors and the [[police]] had, in their opinion, not been fully safeguarded. Investigating authorities were prohibited to privatize their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/LGKIEL/EN/LGKIEL_node.html |title=Official Website of the Kiel District Court |publisher=Schleswig-Holstein |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201081913/http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/LGKIEL/EN/LGKIEL_node.html |archivedate=2012-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the strategy of the GVU in luring software pirates through a so-called [[Honeypot (computing)|honey pot]] trap has remained a subject of criticism. For example, during the course a raid in autumn 2007 suspicions were raised that the GVU and other organizations had installed open [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP servers]] on network, intended for the use by release groups, thus enabling the determination release group members based on their [[IP address]]. According to the unanimous opinion of experts, this approach is, at least legally, unobjectionable.

Individual media outlets have criticised the GVU’s close proximity to [[lawyer]]s, prosecutors, police and internet [[service provider]]s, although naturally these kind of co-operations are part of the work of any interest group. The Association’s close cooperation with various other organizations is repeatedly criticized, especially during its annual Industry Forum.

In August 2010, the GVU was suspected of having caused the unjustified removal of several posts on the video platform [[Vimeo]], which had been published under a [[Creative Commons]] license and are therefore available to all. Among other contents, "You are a terrorist" and "Electric Reporter" were affected. During the course of the investigation into the case it was revealed that the removal of the content was not initiated by the association, but by the company OpSec Security, based in [[Munich]]. The authors Alexander Lehmann and Mario Sixtus were able to obtain an injunction against the company and the GVU has since explicitly distanced itself from the company. According to the GVU, OpSec Security had at no point been contracted to clear videos from Vimeo in its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-failure-takes-down-creative-commons-video-100812/ | title = Anti-Piracy Failure Takes Down Creative Commons Videos | publisher = TorrentFreak | date = 2010-08-12 | accessdate = 2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Giant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth''''' (1890) is an [[oil on canvas]] [[still life]] by [[Martin Johnson Heade]] acquired by the [[National Gallery of Art]] in 1982. Heade made significant contributions to floral still-life painting during the course of his career, the NGA points out, with ''Giant Magnolias'' being one of the finest. Heade married in 1883 and settled in [[St. Augustine, Florida]] after a lackluster career as an itinerant artist. He was patronized by Floridian [[Henry Morrison Flagler]], an oil and railroad magnate, who regularly purchased his works. The NGA believes this personal and professional stability stimulated the production of the still-life paintings of Heade's last years.

The NGA writes, "Certainly works such as ''Giant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth'', with their striking contrasts of brilliantly lit flowers and leaves set against a dark background, are among the most original still lifes of the nineteenth century. They are also for many observers strongly sensual, their lush colors, full, curving contours, overall sense of opulence, and implied perfumed scent of the flowers suggestive, perhaps, of female nudes languidly reclining on luxurious couches."

'''Julie McNamara''' (born 26 March 1960) is a theatre director, playwright, producer, actor and poet. She is Artistic Director of touring theatre company Vital Xposure. Patron of disability arts organisation [[DaDaFest]] and a political activist for human rights and gender politics.

==Early career==
McNamara first performed as a backing singer in 1977 with punk band [[The Plague]]. That same year she was voted Actress of the Year in Merseyside Drama Festival.&lt;ref name="nostringsattached1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nostringsattached.org.au/julie-mcnamara.html |title=Julie McNamara &amp;#124; No Strings Attached Theatre of Disability |publisher=Nostringsattached.org.au |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She went on to work with Lowbrow Theatre, and the [[National Student Drama Festival]] at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. She wrote and directed a trilogy: Venus and the Fly Trap, Cock and Bull Stories and Kill the Fatted Calf all produced in Nottingham 1981- 2.&lt;ref name="nostringsattached1"/&gt; By 1987 she was working for socio-political company Banner Theatre touring the UK’s Trade Union clubs, factory floors and picket lines.&lt;ref name="nostringsattached1"/&gt;

==Theatre and disability==
The majority of McNamara’s work is created to ensure access for Deaf and disabled people is aesthetically integrated within the performance. However, she feels this has not always been successful and there is still scope for new developments. In a 2010 interview with Disability Arts Online she clarified: “We still didn't get it right for everybody. Some people don't read [[British Sign Language]], their first language may be English and we had requests for 'Stage text' which frankly I hate. I don't know what the solution is. I still need to explore possibilities, but I am more and more convinced that the 'access' should never get in the way of the aesthetics of the craft.” &lt;ref name="disabilityartsonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/animate_talks_julie-mcNamara |title=Interview: Julie McNamara discusses her theatre practice, part of Shape Animate |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==
Pig Tales, 2002. McNamara gained a commission through [[Ovalhouse]] and [[Jacksons Lane]] for the Xposure Festival of Disability Arts. She teamed up with Jessica Higgs, Director of In Tandem theatre company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jessicahiggs.org/biography/ |title=Biography |publisher=Jessica Higgs |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pig Tales is composed of five short vignettes based on the nursery rhyme ‘This little piggy went to market’. Pig, the central character, is a female child raised as a boy. Pig’s warring Liverpool Irish family are haunted by the rigid teachings of the Catholic church.

Steak and Chelsea Out to Lunch, was first commissioned by No Strings Attached Theatre in partnership with [[Feast Festival]] Adelaide (2008) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/High-McNamara-Steak-and-Chelsea-Out-to-Lunch |title=Review: Rachel High and Julie McNamara star in Steak and Chelsea Out to Lunch |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossings (2008 -2010) was first commissioned by DaDa Festival in 2008. Originally directed by [[Karena Johnson]], it was re-directed by [[Paulette Randall]] and toured extensively throughout UK, closing at the [[Grand Opera House, Belfast]]. The production was featured on Ulster television [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]], [[BBC Radio 4]] and attracted a Writer's Award through [[DaDaFest]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].&lt;ref name="nostringsattached1"/&gt;  McNamara gained the South Bank Show Award for diversity (2010) &lt;ref name="disabilityartsonline1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juliemc.com/raving.html |title=Julie McNamara- Raving Reviews |publisher=Juliemc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2759712/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t146|title=Julie McNamara|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Knitting Circle (2010 - 2013) Directed first by Antoinette Lester &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thealbany.org.uk/event_detail/930/Theatre/The-Knitting-Circle |title=Theatre &amp;#124; The Knitting Circle |publisher=The Albany |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then by [[Paulette Randall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/The-Knitting-Circle |title=Profile: The Knitting Circle by Julie McNamara |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was written from authentic survivor testimony. The production painted a picture of the lives of women who lived in the old asylums of Britain's long care system. Set within a fictional institution in the 1980s called Harper Park, the patients face the worst aspects of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s 'Community Care' or [[care in the community]] scheme in the 1980s. The idea for the production was inspired by an old recording made 30 years ago, when McNamara was working as a nursing assistant in a long-stay hospital in the Hertfordshire. The cassette contained the voices of female patients she had lived and worked with, all telling their personal stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-ouch-22484308 |title=The secret asylum knitting club - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whisper Me Happy Ever After (2014) Inclusive theatre company Face Front commissioned McNamara to write Whisper Me Happy Ever After.  The play is written from the testimonies of children between 9 – 12 years who have lived with violence in the home. The play makes a strong call out for new ways of dealing with domestic violence and ways to reach young people affected. The story is developed through research with young people and parents who've survived domestic or gang violence, and with teachers, mental health experts, the police, domestic violence forums and support groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facefront.org/index.php/theatre-in-education/list-of-tisp/reducing-crime-and-domestic-violence/151-whisper-me-happy-ever-after |title=Whisper Me Happy Ever After |publisher=Facefront.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let Me Stay (2013-2015) McNamara wrote Let Me Stay as a tribute to her mother Shirley, who lives with [[Alzheimer's]]. The play is the result of years of recordings and filming her mother’s stories and songs.  Shirley McNamara collaborated throughout the creative process. The message of this play is "it is possible to live well with Dementia". McNamara performed in this one woman show under the direction of [[Paulette Randall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://albanydeptford.wordpress.com/2014/06/16/julie-mcnamara-and-director-paulette-randall-discuss-let-me-stay/ |title=Julie McNamara and director Paulette Randall discuss Let Me Stay &amp;#124; The Albany, Deptford |publisher=Albanydeptford.wordpress.com |date=2014-06-16 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Let Me Stay launched in October 2013 at Interacting Festival Corban Arts Centre, Auckland.

This is intended to be a list of notable accidents that occurred during the shooting of films and television, such as cast or crew fatalities or serious accidents that plagued production. It is not intended to be a list of every minor injury an actor or stuntman suffered during filming. Stuntwork accounts for over half of all film-related injuries, with an average of five deaths for every 2,000 injuries.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} From 1980 to 1990, there were 37 deaths relating to accidents during stunts; 24 of these deaths involved the use of helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/sph/glakes/harts1/HARTS_library/stunts.txt|title= Stunt Safety By Michael McCann, Ph.D., C.I.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1910s==
* ''Across the Border'' (1914). On July 1, 1914, while on location in [[Canon City, Colorado]], cast member Grace McHugh was filming a scene where her character was crossing the [[Arkansas River]] in a boat.  When the boat capsized, camera operator Owen Carter immediately jumped into the river to save her.  He dragged her onto a [[sandbar]] that was actually [[quicksand]]. The rest of the film crew watched helplessly as they were sucked into the quicksand and drowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/cgi-bin/colorado?a=d&amp;d=CTR19140702.2.5|title=Grace McHugh, Golden Girl, Is Drowned|author=Staff|work=([[Golden, Colorado|Golden]]) [[Golden Transcript|Colorado Transcript]]|page=1|date=July 2, 1915|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915). Future film director [[Erich von Stroheim]] fell off a roof and broke two ribs in one scene as an extra.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}
*[[The Girl of the Golden West (1915 film)|''The Girl of the Golden West'']] (1915).

*[[The Captive (1915 film)|''The Captive'']] (1915). During filming of a scene where soldiers were required to break down a locked door, the extras fired at the door using live ammunition to give the scene more realism. The director then ordered the extras to reload with blanks in order to film the next shot in which the door is broken down. But one of the extras inadvertently left a live round in his rifle which discharged, shooting another extra, Charles Chandler, in the head, killing him instantly.&lt;ref&gt;DeMille, Cecil B., and Donald Hayne, ed. ''The Autobiography of Cecil B. DeMille''. London: W.H. Allen, 1960. p-116-117.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Woman God Forgot]]'' (1917). In one scene, extras were required to be thrown over the side of an Aztec pyramid. The 'pyramid' was built of wood and covered in paper on which sand had been glued to create the appearance of stone. The extras were 'sand-papered' as they slid down the side of the structure. Having expected such injuries, a crew member was waiting at the bottom with a bucket of iodine.&lt;ref&gt;Fountain, Leatrice G., and John R. Maxim ''1985: Dark Star''. London: Sidgwick &amp; Jackson. p-189.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Valley of the Giants (1919 film)|The Valley of the Giants]]'' (1919). Silent era star [[Wallace Reid]] was badly injured in a train crash during filming in Oregon. His injuries caused him severe pain and the studio supplied him with increasing quantities of morphine so he could keep working. Addicted to morphine and also suffering from alcoholism, Reid died in 1923 at the age of 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldensilents.com/stars/wallacereid.html |title=Wallace Reid (1891-1923) |publisher=''Golden Silents'' |accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1920s==
* ''[[Haunted Spooks]]'' (1920). On the set of a publicity shoot that took place while filming, actor and comedian [[Harold Lloyd]] picked up what he thought was a prop bomb with the fuse lit but realized too late the bomb was real. It detonated, blowing off the thumb and first finger of his right hand and also temporarily blinding him. For the rest of his career, Lloyd concealed his missing fingers with a prosthetic glove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silentfilm.org/archive/girl-shy-1924 |title=''Girl Shy'', 1924 |publisher=San Francisco Silent Film Festival |accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Skywayman]]'' (1920). Pilots Milton Elliott and [[Ormer Locklear]] were killed on 2 August 1920, during filming.

* ''[[Souls for Sale]]'' (1923). Actress [[Barbara La Marr]] injured her ankle during filming and doctors prescribed not only morphine but also cocaine to control the pain and enable her to continue filming. Working on the production left La Marr addicted to drugs, a factor that contributed to her premature death three years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://barbaralamarr.com/Page_2.html |title=Barbara La Marr Biography |author=Lore, Anne |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'' (1924). While hanging from a water tower, [[Buster Keaton]] pulled a rope that released water from the tower, knocking him to the ground. In the scene, he stood and ran into the distance.

On 29 November 1923, while working on location in [[San Antonio, Texas]], [[Martha Mansfield]] was severely burned when a match, tossed by a cast member, ignited her [[American Civil War|Civil War]] costume of [[Hoop skirt|hoopskirts]] and flimsy ruffles. Mansfield was playing the role of Agatha Warren and had just finished her scenes and retired to a car when her clothing burst into flames. Her neck and face were saved when leading man Wilfred Lytell threw his heavy [[overcoat]] over her. The [[chauffeur]] of Mansfield's car was burned badly on his hands while trying to remove the burning clothing from the actress. The fire was put out, but she sustained substantial burns to her body and died the following day.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Times]]'', "Martha Mansfield, Film Star, Dies of Burns Caused by Costume Fired by Smoker's Match", 1 December 1923, Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'' (1927). During filming of the World War I aerial combat scenes, stunt pilot [[Dick Grace]] was required to deliberately crash-land a [[Fokker D-VII]], specially modified to "crumple" on impact. When the Fokker struck the ground, the landing gear failed to crumple, making the impact a heavier one than planned. This caused Grace's safety straps to break, sending his head through the instrument panel, leaving him with four crushed vertebrae and a broken neck. Amazingly, Grace spent only six weeks in the hospital and was back performing stunt work within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silentsaregolden.com/articles/aviationstuntmen.html |title=Daredevils in the Air: Three of the Greats – Wilson, Locklear and Grace |author=Lussier, Tim |publisher=''Silents Are Golden'' |date=2004 |accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March, the ship became trapped in ice near [[Horse Islands (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Horse Isles]] and dynamite stored on board (intended for breaking up ice floes) accidentally detonated, destroying the vessel and killing 27 men, including Frissell and cameraman Alexander Penrod.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/466486%7C465795/The-Viking.html |title=''The Viking'' |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Four Frightened People]]'' (1934). During filming in Hawaii, actress [[Claudette Colbert]] was required to stand up to her neck in a real swamp. This scene was shot on her first day on set after having undergone an emergency appendectomy and Colbert and the director disregarded concerns raised by the on-set nurse. Filming in the unsanitary conditions while not yet fully recovered led to Colbert being hospitalized with a severe fever two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, Lawrence J.

* [[The Lost Patrol (1934 film)|''The Lost Patrol'']] (1934). During filming in high temperatures in Buttercup Valley near [[Yuma, Arizona]], Director [[John Ford]] insisted his cast and crew only work in the early mornings and late afternoons to avoid the most intense heat of each day. Under pressure from RKO to speed up filming, Producer [[Cliff Reid]] insisted that the midday break be shortened. Ford refused, believing that many of the crew would be at risk of heatstroke in the 120-degree [[Fahrenheit|F]] conditions. Reid tried to prove his point by walking around in the open in the midday heat and soon collapsed with heat exhaustion, requiring hospital treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Nollen, Scott Allen.

[[Michael Wayne]] developed skin cancer, his brother [[Patrick Wayne]] had a benign tumor removed from his breast and Hayward's son Tim Barker had a benign tumor removed from his mouth. It is not clear, however, that the cancer rate for this film crew was significantly higher than in the general population.

'''Metalcut''' was a [[relief print]]making technique, belonging to the category of [[old master print]]s. It was almost entirely restricted to the period from about 1450 to 1540, and mostly to the region around the [[Rhine]] in Northern Europe, the [[Low Countries]], [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[Switzerland]]; the technique perhaps originated in the area around [[Cologne]].

==Technique==
[[File:Kreuzigung (Schrotblatt).jpg|thumb|German "dotted manner" print, partly with added colours, 15th century]]
There were two different techniques for making metalcut prints, with very different results.

The first technique is essentially that of [[woodcut]] but using a thin metal plate rather than a wooden block. The areas not to print are cut away, or hammered back with punches. These prints look very much like normal woodcuts of the period, and it can sometimes be hard for experts to tell them apart.[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wifb/hod_31.62.9.htm]  The subject matter is almost entirely religious in the early period, which mostly consists of single prints for display or collecting, and mostly ornamental in the 16th century revival, which mostly consists of illustrations and borders for books.  There was a late flowering of the original method around 1500 in France, with a series of lavish [[Book of Hours|Books of Hours]].  In the sixteenth century the technique continued to be used for elaborate borders and initial letters in books, [http://rubens.anu.edu.au/htdocs/bytype/prints/ornament/bytype/display00014.html] notably by [[Jacob Faber]], who often used designs by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]].

The second technique, was introduced in the second half of the 15th century and worked from ''black to white'', meaning that the print showed white lines on a black background, rather than the other way round as in the first technique.  Again prints were nearly always on religious subjects.  Usually the main lines of the figures and landscape were done in [[engraving]]. Then using [[metalwork]] [[Punch (tool)|punches]], the rest of the image is composed of repeated use of the same pattern of punch in a particular area. These might be dots, circles, lozenges, stars, letters making text inscriptions, or more complicated shapes for the borders. Usually very little space is left undecorated; and this technique is easy to recognise.[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090714113905/http://bode.diee.unica.it/%7Egiua/SEBASTIAN/PICS/anon-german.1470.jpg]  These prints ceased to be produced about 1500.&lt;ref&gt;Field&lt;/ref&gt; The plates themselves may have been treated as works of art in plaque form, with printed impressions a useful by-product; in some cases inscriptions print in reverse, though others do not.&lt;ref&gt;Hind, I, 176-179; Field&lt;/ref&gt; Some copper plates survive, often with nail-holes at the corners.
 
As with the other contemporary print techniques, very few metal cut prints have survived. Prints made by the second technique are sometimes called prints in the '''dotted manner''', or ''dotted prints'', ''Schrotblatt'' in German and ''Manière criblée'' in French.&lt;ref&gt;Field&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also possible to combine the techniques on the same plate, with figures using black lines, and backgrounds with punched white dots on a black background. French printed [[books of hours]] from the end of the century often use such combinations.

==Practitioners==
Despite the limitations of the technique, many of the artists who used the second technique were very talented, and the best prints have considerable power.[http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/pimage?8323+0+0] Compared to contemporary  [[engraving]]s and [[woodcut]]s, they were usually large, as the technique needed space on the plate. No names are known of the artists; presumably most of them were trained as [[goldsmith]]s, as the punch shapes used were typical ones from goldsmithing.

[[File:FemaleMobiledj2.jpg|thumb|Mobile disc jockey]]
'''Mobile disc jockeys''' (also known as '''mobile DJs''' or '''mobile discos''') are [[disc jockey]]s that tour with portable sound, lighting, and video systems.&lt;ref name="answers.com"&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/mobile-disc-jockey&lt;/ref&gt; They play music for a targeted audience from a collection of pre-recorded music using [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]], [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]], [[Compact disc|CDs]], or digital music formats such as [[USB flash drive]]s or [[Laptop|laptop computers]].&lt;ref name="answers.com"/&gt;

Mobile DJs perform at a variety of events including [[wedding reception]]s, [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]] receptions, company parties, school dances, anniversaries, and birthday parties. They also perform in public at taverns, nightclubs, and block parties.&lt;ref name="Zemon, Stacy 2002"/&gt;
 
Business models for mobile disc jockeys include full-time, part-time, multi-operator, and single-operator companies.&lt;ref name="Zemon, Stacy 2002"&gt;Zemon, Stacy.  ''The Mobile DJ Handbook: How to Start &amp; Run a Profitable Mobile Disc Jockey Service'', Second Edition.  St. Louis:  Focal Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of mobile discos started in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1966, when Roger Squire began an entertainment service in North [[London]] named "Roger Squire's Mobile Discothèques". The word ''discothèque'' is French for "disco". Within two years, Squire had fifteen mobile discothèques performing approximately sixty functions each week. He performed at events attended by celebrities and royalty, at countless college dances, wedding receptions, and all kinds of social events. Over the next few years, many copycat "Mobile Discos" started to emulate his successful formula. During this period, London got its "[[Swinging London]]" reputation. Squire later set up a disco equipment supply service that sold disco sound and lighting systems to budding DJs, both in the United Kingdom and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Jerry 1983 "The Beginning" Disco International &amp; Club News (UK Magazine), August edition, pages 49 – 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, mobile DJs began to form associations and create professional business networks that evolved into annual trade shows and internet discussion forums. The early 1990s saw the emergence of organized professional trade shows such as the "Mobile Beat Show" in [[Las Vegas]], Nevada, and the "DJ Times Expo" in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], New Jersey. Seminars by numerous respected DJs such as John Rozz, Ray "Ray Mar" Martinez, Stacy Zemon, Mark Ferrell, [[Peter Merry]], Randy Bartlett, and Steve Moody{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} have helped DJs to better understand their profession, how to be more professional and to treat being a DJ as a business operation.

1991 saw the publication of ''Mobile Beat'', a magazine geared specifically toward mobile DJs. In 1992, the [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] (MPEG), released The MPEG-1 file standard, designed to produce reasonable sound from a digital file using minimal storage. The lossy compression scheme MPEG-1 Layer-3, popularly known as [[MP3]], later revolutionized the digital music domain.

In 1998, [[Final Scratch]] debuted at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to give DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded vinyl records or CDs. While it would take some time for this novel concept to catch on with the "die hard" vinyl-oriented DJs, it was the first step in the new digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJ pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being "Professor Jam", also known as William P. Rader, who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the "Computerized Performance System" (CPS) known as "DJ Summit", which helped spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.

The American Disc Jockey Awards Show was established, and its first edition was held in Las Vegas, Nevada. Since then, thirteen mobile DJs have been elected to the American Disc Jockey Hall of Fame. The thirteen members include John Rozz, Al Lampkin, Joe Martin, Robert A. Lindquist, Jon Michaels, Mike Buonaccorso, Sid Vanderpool, Bobby Morganstein, John Roberts, Ken Knotts, Ray "Ray Mar" Martinez, Cesar Cosio, and Bernie Howard-Fryman.&lt;ref&gt;Mobile Beat Magazine May 2006 Issue Page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Disc Jockey Awards Show annually recognizes and honors individuals who have given of themselves to benefit their community or a charitable cause in the name of the ADJA or the DJ Trade as a whole. &lt;!-- Known as the Michael Butler Humanitarian Award, recipients include the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1998 – Mark “Peace” Thomas&lt;br /&gt;
1999 – Ray Martinez&lt;br /&gt;
2000 – Professor Jam (aka William P. Rader)&lt;br /&gt;
2003 – Patrick McDonald&lt;br /&gt;
2006 – Larry Williams&lt;br /&gt;
2007 – Jeremy Miller&lt;br /&gt;
2007 – Roy Dueitt&lt;br /&gt;
2007 – Bill Dunsing&lt;br /&gt;
2008 -  Louie Castellanos&lt;br /&gt;
2009 -  Ed Frank&lt;br /&gt;
2011 -  Eric Horne&lt;br /&gt;
2012 – Geoffrey Sandler&lt;br /&gt;
2013 – Mitch Taylor
--&gt;

The "DJ of the Year" winners at the DJ Times Expo include three-time winner Marcello Pedalino, Roxanne Greene, K.C. KoKoruz, Shawn "Big Daddy" McKee, Marz Lawhorn, Gerry Siracusa, Adam Weitz, Steve Moody and Pascal Levesque who, in 2013, was the first Canadian to take part in the competition. Pascal Levesque from Québec, Canada, was named "DJ of the Year Runner-Up" and won the "Best Dance" award.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Developments==
A number of books have been written about the business, and by furthering their education at trade shows and seminars, mobile DJs have gained a positive public perception. In the 1970s Mobile DJs were averaging $350–500 per four-hour event; now a wedding reception can cost between $800–2,500 per event, with the national average being around $1,038.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xogroupinc.com/press-releases-home/2014-press-releases/2014-03-27-real-weddings-study-average-cost-of-wedding.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620151633/http://www.xogroupinc.com/press-releases-home/2014-press-releases/2014-03-27-real-weddings-study-average-cost-of-wedding.aspx |archivedate=2014-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many club disc jockeys still use traditional vinyl records, many mobile DJs also currently use [[compact disc]]s, computer-based files (such as [[MP3]]s), or a combination of sources. In addition, professional-grade equipment created by a variety of companies expressly for the mobile DJ industry has allowed for faster set-up and break down times and improved quality of performance.&lt;ref name="Graudins, Charles A. 2004"&gt;Graudins, Charles A. "How to Be a DJ''.  Boston:  Course Technology PTR, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advance of in-home sound systems, the audience expectation level of sound and lighting shows for concerts, conventions, and weddings has increased. [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] technology is the most recent light show technology incorporated by the trade. A large selection of music, professional-grade equipment, good organizational skills, vocal talent as a Master of Ceremonies, mixing skills, quality lighting, insurance for [[Legal liability|liability]], and on-site back-up equipment are typical of the expectations customers have when hiring a mobile DJ.&lt;ref name="Graudins, Charles A. 2004"/&gt; Suggestions for hiring mobile disc jockeys include requests for referrals, approximate age of equipment, level of insurance, contract terms and fees, and provision of electrical sources.

Many mobile DJs also promote themselves as event planners, organizers, and [[Master of ceremonies]] (MC). They work closely with their customers, guests, and the event's other vendors (e.g. venue staff and photographers/videographers) to provide quality entertainment that fits the event in terms of style and performance.&lt;ref name="Zemon, Stacy 2002"/&gt;

This increased role in event planning has been facilitated by the emergence of [[Sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteens]], popularized by the [[MTV]] reality show, ''[[My Super Sweet 16]]''. Today's mobile DJs are tasked with putting together major productions for these events, which require customization in every element of “her big night”. As huge as the demand for qualified teen-event DJs is, the equipment list to bring a full production on the road for a successful event is more than most can afford. With large-screen video, fog, light up dance floors, glow lights, lasers, high end dance lighting, and booming sound, today's Sweet Sixteens are setting the bar high for future generations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7882">'''Oba''' means [[ruler]] in the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Bini people|Bini]] languages of contemporary [[West Africa]]. Kings in [[Yorubaland]], a region which is in the modern republics of [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Togo]], make use of it as a pre-nominal [[honorific]]. Post-colonial examples of Yoruba bearers include Oba [[Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi|Ogunwusi]] of [[Ile Ife]], Oba Aromolaran of [[Ilesha]] and Oba [[Lamidi Adeyemi III|Adeyemi]] of [[Oyo State|Oyo]]. An example of a Bini bearer is Oba Ewuare II of [[Kingdom of Benin|Benin]].

The title is distinct from that of '''Oloye''', which is used in like fashion by subordinate titleholders in the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] chieftaincy system.

==Aristocratic titles among the Yoruba==

The Yoruba [[chieftaincy]] system can be divided into four separate [[Nobility|ranks]]: royal chiefs, noble chiefs, religious chiefs and common chiefs. The royals are led by the obas, who sit at the apex of the hierarchy and serve as the [[fons honorum]] of the entire system. They are joined in the class of royal chiefs by the titled [[dynast]]s of their royal families. The three other ranks, who traditionally provide the membership of a series of [[privy council]]s, [[sect]]s and [[guild]]s, oversee the day-to-day administration of the Yoruba [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] and are led by the [[Ogboni#The Iwarefa|Iwarefa]]s, the [[Babalawo|Araba]]s and the titled [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]s of the kingdoms' constituent families.

==Oba==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 70.109.2 Beaded Crown Ade of Onijagbo Obasoro Alowolodu Ogoga of Ikere 1890-1928.jpg|thumbnail|Beaded Crown "Ade" of King Onijagbo Obasoro Alowolodu, the Ogoga of Ikere]]
There are two different kinds of Yoruba monarchs: The kings of Yoruba [[clan]]s, which are often simply networks of related towns (For example, the Oba of the [[Egba people|Egba]] bears the title "[[Alake of Egba (title)|Alake of Egbaland]]" because his ancestral seat is the [[Egba Alake|Ake]] quarter of [[Abeokuta]], hence the title Alake, which is Yoruba for ''Man of Ake''. The [[Oyo Kingdom|Oyo]] oba, meanwhile, bears the title "[[Alaafin]]", which means ''Man of the palace'') and the kings of individual Yoruba towns, such as that of [[Iwo, Nigeria|Iwo]] - a town in [[Osun]] State - who bears the title "Olu'wo" (Olu of Iwo, lit. ''Lord of Iwo'').

The first generation towns of the Yoruba homeland, which encompasses large swathes of the said countries of Benin, Nigeria, and Togo, are those with obas who generally wear beaded crowns; the rulers of many of the 'second generation' settlements are also often obas. Those that remain and those of the third generation tend to only be headed by the holders of the title "Baale" (lit. ''Head of the Clan''), who do not wear crowns and who are, at least in theory, the reigning viceroys of people who do.

==Oloye==

All of the subordinate members of the Yoruba aristocracy, both traditional titleholders and honorary ones, use the pre-nominal "Oloye" (lit. ''Owner of a title'', also appearing as "Ijoye") in the way that kings and queens regnant use 'Oba'. It is also often used by princes and princesses in colloquial situations, though the title that is most often ascribed to them officially is "Omoba" (lit. ''Child of a Monarch'', sometimes rendered alternatively as "Omo'ba", "Omooba" and "Omo-Oba"). The wives of kings, princes and chiefs of royal background usually make use of the title "Olori" (the equivalent of ''Princess Consort'', otherwise spelled "Oloori"), though some of the wives of dynastic rulers prefer to be referred to as "Ayaba" (the equivalent of ''Queen Consort''). The wives of the non-royal chiefs, when themselves titleholders in their own right, tend to use the honorific "Iyaloye" (lit. ''Lady who owns a title'') in their capacities as married chieftesses.

==The Oba's crown==
{{Main|Oba's crown}}

The bead-embroidered crown with beaded veil, foremost attribute of the oba, symbolizes the aspirations of a civilization at the highest level of authority. In his seminal article on the topic, Robert F. Thompson writes, "The crown incarnates the intuition of royal ancestral force, the revelation of great moral insight in the person of the king, and the glitter of aesthetic experience."&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert F.|title=African art &amp; leadership|year=1972|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=0299058204|pages=227–260|editor=Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal duties==
[[File:US Navy 060602-N-8637R-010 Commanding Officer USS Barry (DDG 52), Cmdr. Jeffrey Wolstenholme, presents the Oba of Nigeria, with a ship's plaque during the ship's visit.jpg|thumb|June 2006, [[:w:USS Barry (DDG-52)|USS ''Barry'']] (DDG 52), Cmdr. Jeffrey Wolstenholme, presents [[Rilwan Akiolu]], the [[Oba of Lagos]], with a ship's plaque during the ship's visit.]]

The role of the oba has diminished with the coming of [[Colonialism|colonial]] and [[democracy|democratic]] [[institutions]]. However, an event that still has symbolic prestige and capital is that of chieftaincy title-taking and awarding. This dates back to the era of the [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] warrior chiefs and [[palace]] officials in the medieval period, when powerful individuals of varied ancestries held prominent titles in the [[empire]]. In [[Yorubaland]], like in many other areas of Benin, Nigeria and Togo, chieftaincy titles are mostly given to successful men and women from within a given sub-sectional territory, although it is not unheard of for a person from elsewhere to receive one. The [[title]]s also act as symbolic capital that can be used to gain favour when desired by the individual oba that awarded them, and sometimes vice versa. During any of the traditional [[investiture]] ceremonies for the chiefs-designate, the oba is regarded by the Yoruba as the major center of attention, taking precedence over even the members of the official governments of any of the three countries if they are present. As he leads the procession of nominees into a specially embroidered dais in front of a wider audience of guests and well wishers, festivities of varied sorts occur to the accompaniment of traditional drumming. Emblems are given out according to seniority, and drapery worn by the oba and chiefs are created to be elaborate and also expensive. Most of the activities are covered by the local [[Mass media|media]] and enter the public domain thereafter. Only the secret initiations for traditional chiefs of the highest rank are kept secret from all outsiders. Ceremonies such as this, and the process of selection and maintenance of networks of chiefs, are two of the major sources of power for the contemporary royals of [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Caplan, Humphrey Fisher, David Parkin; The Politics of Cultural Performance. Berghahn Books, 1996, p 30-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priestly duties==

As a sacred ruler, the oba is traditionally regarded by the Yoruba as the ex officio chief priest of all of the [[Orisha]] sects in his or her domain. Although most of the day-to-day functions of this position are delegated in practice to such figures as the Arabas, certain traditional rites of the Yoruba religion can only be performed by the oba, and it is for this reason that the holders of the title are often thought of as being religious leaders in addition to being politico-ceremonial monarchs.

A '''photo blanket''' is a large, rectangular piece of fabric displaying images, pictures, or designs, often with bound edges, used as a [[blanket]] or decorative object.  Historically photo blanket were made of thick cloth depicting people, objects, and symbols intended to tell a story or reveal historical events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/blanket.html Encarta (North American) Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The photo blanket has a history nearly as long as the history of clothing itself.  For thousands of years, people around the world used blankets as a form of communication through storytelling, honoring dead, and a well-respected form of art.

Ancient [[Egyptians]] weaved colored threads and sometimes even gold into a fabric (usually linen) or by painting with inks and dyes on [[papyrus]] cloth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eternalegypt.org Eternal Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt;  The cloth (blanket) would often form pictures to tell stories and to honor prominent people or one of the multiple gods of their culture.

[[Navajo people|Navajo]] tribes used special [[indigo dye]] from Mexico and other [[vegetal dyes]] to color multi-ply yarns and weave them into three main types of blankets - a [[serape]] (a shoulder covering blanket that is longer than it is wide), a [[saddle blanket]] (a blanket that was folded in half under a horse’s saddle for extra cushioning), and a chief's blanket (a shoulder blanket that was made wider than it was long).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianterritory.com Indian Territory]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[People of Nepal|Nepalese]] rug makers - one of the most respected jobs in their society - would use luxurious silks, wools, and hemp to create beautiful works or art.  Using vertical looms and fibers dyed with [[natural dye|natural vegetal dyes]], they form several different types of knots together for a soft and evenly tufted finish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lecaflor.co.uk/pdfs/tiger.pdf   Bringing New Life to an Ancient Craft]&lt;/ref&gt;

For hundreds of years, tribes throughout [[Indonesia]] and [[Africa]] have used a dye and resist technique called [[batik]] to create intricate patterns and pictures.  During the past two or three centuries batik has become one of the principal means of expression of the spiritual and cultural values of Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discover-indo.tierranet.com/batikpag.htm Discover Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt;  Once again used as a form of storytelling and passing down history, picture fabrics and blankets have been an integral part of their culture.

[[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]] have used weaving and blankets for the same purposes, using gold and other precious metals woven into their cloths and blankets.  As an important artistic form, it conveys the history and myths of a culture through [[iconography]] and pictures.

Throughout history, photo blankets have been an ever present and fundamental key to communication, decoration, and tradition.  Today’s photo blankets have changed to modern techniques and more efficient manufacturing, but the primary meaning has remained very similar.  People display meaningful photos that represent memories and reveal history.  Adding text or symbols communicate [[language]] and add to the blanket’s storytelling aspect.

== Uses ==
Photo blankets are used throughout the home for displaying pictures and images as objects of decor, for warmth, or to be given and received as gifts.

Uses in home decor include furniture coverings and as decorative displays of a design or [[photograph]].  Photo blankets can be used to cuddle up for warmth either in or outdoors.  They are often given as wedding, birthday, [[Christmas]], baby, or anniversary gifts to individuals or couples displaying memorable pictures, dates and quotes on them.

== Types ==
There are three main types of photo blankets - woven photo blankets, knitted photo blankets, and dyed photo blankets.

A woven photo blanket is made on a [[jacquard loom]] using digital software that scans a picture, creates a pattern and then creates a woven picture blanket using various colored yarns that interlace at 90 degree angles (see [[weaving|weave]]).  Woven photo blankets, comes in two varieties; an afghan photo blanket and a tapestry photo blanket.  The yarn used in the weave of an afghan photo blanket is the same thickness in both horizontal and vertical directions while a tapestry photo blanket is manufactured with yarn of two different diameters. In a tapestry photo blanket the thinner of the two yarns; i.e., the warp, actually consists of 6-8 different color strands of yarn which are combined in various ways, based on a photo, to re-create the colors as accurately as possible (even black and white).  

A knitted photo blanket is made by a machine that uses a similar scanning and pattern process, but instead of weaving the yarns together, knits them together in a looping technique (see [[knit]]).  Often knitted photo blankets consist of limited colors due to the knitting process and the continuous thread forming loops in the process.

A dyed photo blanket is the newest type of photo blanket and is made by printing dye onto fabric from a digital image (see [[dye sublimation]]).  This type allows for unlimited colors and has the sharpest picture clarity of the three.  

Each process creates a permanent picture, with varying degrees of softness, color and clarity.

Since most forms of Western music can make use of the piano, pianists have a wide [[Piano repertoire|repertoire]] and a wide variery of styles to choose from, among them traditional [[classical music]], [[jazz piano|jazz]], [[blues piano|blues]], and all sorts of [[popular music]], including [[rock music|rock and roll]]. Most pianists can, to an extent, easily play other [[musical keyboard|keyboard]]-related instruments such as the [[synthesizer]], [[harpsichord]], [[celesta]], and the [[organ (music)|organ]].

==Pianists past and present==
Modern [[classical music|classical]] pianists dedicate their careers to performing, recording, teaching, researching, and learning new works to expand their repertoire. They generally do not write or transcribe music as pianists did in the 19th century. Some classical pianists might specialize in accompaniment and [[chamber music]], while others (though comparatively few) will perform as full-time soloists.

==Classical ==
[[File:Ian Parker.jpg|thumb|300px|Canadian pianist [[Ian Parker (Canadian pianist)|Ian Parker]] performing [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1]] with the Maui Pops Orchestra in 2016|alt=A man plays a piano with enthusiasm, his left hand raised in preparation for striking keys; behind him, the string section of an orchestra plays accompaniment.]]
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] could be considered the first "concert pianist" as he performed widely on the piano. Composers [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]] from the classical era were also famed for their playing, as were, from the romantic era,  [[Liszt]], [[Brahms]], [[Chopin]], [[Mendelssohn]] and [[Rachmaninoff]]. From that era, leading performers less known as composers were Clara Schumann and [[Hans von Bülow]]. However, as we do not have modern audio recordings of most of these pianists, we rely mainly on written commentary to give us an account of their technique and style.

==Jazz ==
[[File:Tord Gustavsen (221258).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tord Gustavsen]] playing piano during a concert at the 2016 [[Oslo Jazzfestival|Oslo Jazz Festival]] in Norway
|alt=A black-and-white photo of a man playing a piano; he is hunched over it and is concentrating deeply.]]Jazz pianists almost always perform with other musicians. Their playing is more free than that of  classical pianists and they create an air of spontaneity in their performances. They generally do not write down their compositions; improvisation is a significant part of their work. Well known jazz pianists include [[Art Tatum]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Oscar Peterson]] and [[Bud Powell]].

==Pop==
Popular pianists might work as live performers (concert, theatre, etc.), session musicians, arrangers most likely feel at home with synthesizers and other electronic keyboard instruments. Notable popular pianists include [[Victor Borge]] who performed as a comedian; [[Richard Clayderman]], who is known for his covers of popular tunes; and singer and entertainer [[Liberace]], who at the height of his fame, was one of the highest paid entertainers in the world.

==Amateur pianism==
[[File:Johnny_Hahn_January_2012.JPG|thumb|225px|An amateur pianist playing outdoors at [[Pike Place]] market in [[Seattle]].]]
Some people, having received a solid piano training in their youth, decide not to continue their musical careers but choose nonmusical ones. As a result, there are prominent communities of ''amateur pianists'' all over the world that play at quite a high level and give concerts not to earn money but just for the love of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreas|first1=Møller|title=Professionel pianist leverer dinnermusik til jeres fest af højeste klasse|url=http://www.pianomusic.dk/|website=Pianomusic.dk|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs]], held annually in [[Paris]], attracts about one thousand listeners each year and is broadcast on French radio.

It is notable that [[Jon Nakamatsu]], the Gold Medal winner of the prestigious [[Van Cliburn International Piano Competition]] for professional pianists in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] (1997) was at the moment of his victory technically an amateur: he never attended a music conservatory or majored in music, and worked as a high school German teacher at the time; it was only after the competition that he started pursuing a career as a classical pianist.

The German pianist [[Davide Martello]] is known for traveling around conflict zones to play his moving piano. Martello has previously been recognised by the European parliament for his “outstanding contribution to European cooperation and the promotion of common values”.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/paris-attacks-john-lennon-imagine-pianist-davide-martello-klavierkunst|title=Paris attacks: pianist 'drove 400 miles through the night' to pay tribute|first=Jonathan|last=Bucks|date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wikipedia Polandball.png|thumb|The character of [[Poland]], represented as a ball colored like an upside-down [[Polish flag]].]]
'''Polandball''', also known as '''countryballs''', refers to [[user-generated]] visual art, typically manifesting as [[online comics]], where [[country|countries]] are [[National personification|personified]] as (typically) spherical [[persona]]s decorated with their country's flag, interacting in often [[broken English]] named ''Engrish'' (with the exception of countryballs that speak English natively). The characters poke fun at [[national stereotypes]] and [[international relations]], as well as historical conflicts. It is an [[Internet meme]] which originated on the /int/ board of German [[imageboard]] [[Krautchan.net]] in the latter half of 2009.

The comics style may be referred to both as ''Polandball'' (by convention, even in cases where there is no Poland among the cartoon characters) and ''countryball'' (or, collectively, ''countryballs'').

== Background ==
[[File:Opera Mundi 2.png|thumb|400px|A group of Polandball characters]]
Polandball has its roots in an August 2009 "cyberwar" between Polish Internet users and the rest of the world on drawball.com. The website, which offers a virtual canvas, allows Internet users to draw whatever they want, and to draw over others' drawings. On the [[Internet in Poland]], an idea was raised to draw the [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] on the ball, and thousands of Poles together managed to take over the drawball with a painting of white on top of red, with the word "[[Poland|POLSKA]]" written in the middle. After co-ordination from [[4chan]], this was then covered over by a giant [[Nazi swastika|swastika]].&lt;ref name="gazeta"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,86116,7462232,Wyniosle_lol_zaborcow__czyli_Polandball.html|title=Wyniosłe lol zaborców, czyli Polandball|last=Orliński|first=Wojciech|authorlink=Wojciech Orliński|date=5 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101071958/http://wyborcza.pl/1,86116,7462232,Wyniosle_lol_zaborcow__czyli_Polandball.html|archivedate=1 January 2012|publisher=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]|language=Polish|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cooltura"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elondyn.co.uk/newsy,wpis,7731|title=Znowu lecą z nami w... kulki|last=Zapałowski|first=Radosław|date=15 February 2010|publisher=[[Cooltura]]|language=Polish|accessdate=6 August 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Rat4O7DW?url=http://www.elondyn.co.uk/newsy,wpis,7731|archivedate=5 August 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Krautchan.net]] is a [[German-language]] [[imageboard]] whose /int/ board is frequented by [[English-speaking]] [[netizen]]s. The beginning of the Polandball meme is credited to ''Falco'', a [[British people|British]] user on /int/, who created the meme in September 2009 using [[Microsoft Paint]] in an apolitical way to [[Internet troll|troll]] ''[[Wojak]]'', a Pole on the same board who contributes in [[broken English]], after which Polandball cartoons were enthusiastically drawn by [[Russians]].&lt;ref name="gazeta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="przeglad"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.przeglad-tygodnik.pl/pl/artykul/fenomem|title=Fenomem&amp;nbsp;— Polska nie umieć kosmos|last=Kapiszewski|first=Kuba|date=5 April 2010|publisher=[[Przegląd]]|language=Polish|accessdate=5 August 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Rasv9f4k?url=http://www.przeglad-tygodnik.pl/pl/artykul/fenomem|archivedate=5 August 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kurzgeek&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plomlompom|first1=Nils Dagsson Moskopp Erlehmann &amp; Christian Heller|title=Internet-Meme : kurz &amp; geek|date=2013|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly Verlag]]|isbn=978-3-86899-806-1|pages=86–88|edition=1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bRywAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=5 August 2014|language=German|chapter=MS-Paint-Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polandball comics have no defined authors, and anyone is able to make one.&lt;ref name=vox /&gt; This has become an [[internet meme]], presented e.g., at  [[Reddit]]&lt;ref name=kurzgeek /&gt;&lt;ref name=businesspost&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Emmet|title=Polandball is Reddit's answer to Crimea crisis|url=http://www.businesspost.ie/#!story/Home/News/Polandball+is+Reddit's+answer+to+Crimea+crisis/id/87198161-2385-315c-abda-d92435575507|accessdate=8 November 2014|work=[[The Sunday Business Post]]|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name=fd1&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/polandballcomics/photos/a.400372110298043.1073741826.400369026965018/402985193370068/?type=3&amp;theater |title=dzien dobry, friend.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fd2&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/polandball/posts/10158229035170483:0 |title=POLANDBALL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

=== Poland ===
[[File:Poland can into the European Space Agency.png|thumb|left|An example of a Polandball comic which is an extension of the "Poland cannot into space" {{sic}} catchphrase. The comic references Poland joining the [[European Space Agency]] in 2012.]]
The premise of Polandball is that it represents Poland and its [[history of Poland|history]], [[Foreign relations of Poland|relations with other countries]] and [[stereotype]]s,&lt;ref name="przeglad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hiro"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hiro.pl/magazyn/magazyn_zjawiska/memy.html|title=MEMY.

Some Polandball comics arise from the premise that Russia can fly into space, whilst Poland can not. (Although in reality, a Polish astronaut, [[Mirosław Hermaszewski]], did fly into space aboard the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Soyuz 30]] spacecraft in 1978.)

One of the most popular Polandball comics begins with the premise that Earth is going to be struck by a giant meteor, leading to all countries with [[space technology]] leaving Earth and going into [[orbit]] around the planet. At the end of the cartoon, Poland, still on earth, is crying, and in broken English pronounces the canonical Polandball catchphrase "'''Poland cannot into space'''".&lt;ref name="przeglad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="infokam" /&gt; In this [[Polish joke|humorous way]], Russians put a halt to all discussion with Poles on which country is superior.&lt;ref name="gazeta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="przeglad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hiro" /&gt;

=== Other countries ===
Polandball can also include comics on other countries, but by convention these comics are usually still referred to as Polandball,&lt;ref name="gazeta" /&gt; although they can also be called countryballs.&lt;ref name=kurzgeek /&gt; Countries are also represented as balls,&lt;ref name=vox /&gt; although there are many novel exceptions. [[Singapore]], [[Bermuda]], and more rarely the Colombian department [[Nariño]] take the form of a triangle, in which Singapore is sometimes referred to as ''Tringapore''. [[Nepal]] (sometimes called ''Nepalrawr'') is in the shape of its national flag (one triangle on top of another) and has teeth. There are a few other "rawrs" like Nepal, such as the [[Maratha Empire]] and the state of [[Ohio]]. The [[German Empire]] of 1871–1918 (on [[Facebook]] and elsewhere) or the theoretical [[Fourth Reich]] (on [[Reddit]]) is a tall rectangle with small eyes and is known as ''Reichtangle''. [[Israel]] as well as the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] takes the form of a [[hypercube]] (in reference to [[Jewish physics]]). The State of [[Michigan]] is also commonly depicted as a cube. [[Kazakhstan]] takes the form of a brick sometimes called ''Kazakhbrick'', due to Kazakhstan being the only country whose flag icon was inadvertently not changed to a ball on Krautchan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ's and Ask the Mods! • r/polandball|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/1jrl9j/faqs_and_ask_the_mods/cbhxi6k/|website=reddit|quote=Why is Kazakhstan a brick?

Since Polandball was in its infancy at that time, and was also born in the chans, the two bled together despite Omsk Bird having no logical connection. Today Omsk Bird keeps its association with drugs, but in comics is also generally represented as a malicious and powerful entity.|accessdate=3 November 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries also have established accessories. The [[United States]] sports a pair of [[Sunglasses|shades]], the [[United Kingdom]] wears a [[monocle]] and a [[top hat]] (as does [[Hong Kong]], since it was once a [[British Hong Kong|territory of the United Kingdom]]) and [[Canada]] is often seen wearing a [[coonskin cap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.krakowpost.com/9279/2015/05/how-polandball-can-of-taking-over-internets|title=How Polandball can of taking over internets|last=Hoffman|first=Steven|website=Krakow Post|access-date=2016-04-02|date=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indonesia]] is always drawn with either a [[songkok]] or [[Asian conical hat]] to distinguish it from Poland (given its upside-down flag), with [[Monaco]] also distinguishing itself by often being drawn extremely small. [[Vatican City]] also regularly wears a [[mitre]]. Other noted countryballs include countries whose emblems are offset to the hoist of their flags (i.e [[Serbia]] and [[Slovakia]]) which are usually depicted as [[eyepatch]]es, with [[Austria-Hungary]] often being depicted as blind while wearing two eyepatches.

The simplicity of Polandball, added with its recognition of world history and a focus on current affairs, makes the meme suited to commenting on international events.&lt;ref name=vox&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Max|title=Is there a series of irreverent political cartoons summing up the crisis?|url=https://www.vox.com/cards/ukraine-everything-you-need-to-know/is-there-a-series-of-pithy-political-cartoons-summing-up-the-crisis|accessdate=6 August 2014|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst events which have been covered by Polandball and have been noted in the media, are the [[Senkaku Islands dispute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japon, Chine, vers une nouvelle guerre froide|url=http://www.franceculture.fr/emission-affaires-etrangeres-japon-chine-vers-une-nouvelle-guerre-froide-2013-03-09|accessdate=8 November 2014|work=[[France Culture]]|date=9 March 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Tve15wmz?url=http://www.franceculture.fr/emission-affaires-etrangeres-japon-chine-vers-une-nouvelle-guerre-froide-2013-03-09|archivedate=8 November 2014|language=French|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Papal conclave, 2013|2013 papal conclave]] which saw Jorge Mario Bergoglio being elected as the [[Pope Francis|new Pope]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wybór Franciszka okiem internautów|url=http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/swiat/wybor-franciszka-okiem-internautow/e1j5e|accessdate=6 August 2014|publisher=[[Onet.pl]]|date=14 March 2013|archiveurl=http://www.peeep.us/037878fc|archivedate=6 August 2014|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[2014 Ukrainian crisis]],&lt;ref name=vox /&gt;&lt;ref name=infokam&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Камышин «может в кантриболз»|url=http://infokam.su/n16994.html|accessdate=8 November 2014|work=Infokam|date=7 August 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TvdlsKwi?url=http://infokam.su/n16994.html|archivedate=8 November 2014|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Аниматор из Камышина нарисовал мультфильм о «заболевшей» Украине|url=http://www.vlg.aif.ru/society/details/1311029|accessdate=8 November 2014|work=[[Argumenty i Fakty]]|date=6 August 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TvdP3cDW?url=http://www.vlg.aif.ru/society/details/1311029|archivedate=8 November 2014|location=[[Volgograd]]|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[2014 Crimean crisis]]&lt;ref name=businesspost /&gt; and issues relating to [[Filipinos in Taiwan|Filipino workers in Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=台灣最美麗的風景是人　真的嗎？ (Taiwan is one of the most beautiful landscapes, really?)|url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/life/20140731/443613/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%9C%80%E7%BE%8E%E9%BA%97%E7%9A%84%E9%A2%A8%E6%99%AF%E6%98%AF%E4%BA%BA%E3%80%80%E7%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E5%97%8E%EF%BC%9F|accessdate=6 August 2014|publisher=[[Apple Daily]] (Taiwanese edition)|date=31 July 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RcFSMpvN?url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/life/20140731/443613/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%9C%80%E7%BE%8E%E9%BA%97%E7%9A%84%E9%A2%A8%E6%99%AF%E6%98%AF%E4%BA%BA%E3%80%80%E7%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E5%97%8E%EF%BC%9F|archivedate=6 August 2014|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sweden-Finland.png|thumb|A Polandball comic which satirises [[Sweden–Finland]].]]
A report on the Russian radio station [[Vesti FM]] noted a post on [[Livejournal]] which asked readers to list five images that come to mind when thinking of Poland or [[Poles]]. The five pages of responses, illustrating the deep historical ties between Russia and Poland, recalled subjects including [[False Dmitriy I]], ''Tomek in the Land of the Kangaroos'' by Polish author [[Alfred Szklarski]], ''[[Czterej pancerni i pies]]'' ("Four tank-men and a dog"), [[Russophobia]] and Polandball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klava|first1=P.|script-title=ru:Польша у россиян ассоциируется с Лжедмитрием и Польшаром|url=http://radiovesti.ru/episode/show/episode_id/22667|accessdate=8 November 2014|work=[[Vesti FM]]|date=25 August 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Tvc8mT6B?url=http://radiovesti.ru/episode/show/episode_id/22667|archivedate=8 November 2014|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wojciech Oleksiak, writing on culture.pl, a project of the Polish government-funded [[Adam Mickiewicz Institute]] which has the aim of promoting Polish language and culture abroad, noted that due to anyone being able to create a Polandball comic, the existence of the meme has created new opportunities for people to express their personal views on race, religion and history. In describing Polandball as the Internet ''par excellence'', he further stated that comic plots can be "rude, impolite, racist, abusive, or just plain dumb", whilst also noting that the [[political incorrectness|politically incorrect]] nature of the comics add to the attractiveness of the meme.&lt;ref name="casestudy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oleksiak|first1=Wojciech|title=Polandball&amp;nbsp;— A Case Study|url=http://culture.pl/en/article/polandball-a-case-study|accessdate=6 August 2014|work=Culture.pl|publisher=[[Adam Mickiewicz Institute]]|date=9 June 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RcFd8k2j?url=http://culture.pl/en/article/polandball-a-case-study|archivedate=6 August 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Oleksiak notes that Polandball comics often employ exaggerated Polish stereotypes, such as Poles not being as proficient in English as other nationalities, and Poland itself being a country full of dull-witted psycho-Catholics. On the other hand, some stereotypes employed in Polandball comics, such as Poles telling stories about the nation's glorious history and dwelling on a deep rooted martyrdom, are mostly true; whilst the stereotype that Poles hold many national complexes and blame external forces for their own failures, is true, but somewhat justified.&lt;ref name="casestudy" /&gt;

Oleksiak further notes that from Polandball, Poles can learn to have "a sense of humour about our long-time grudges".&lt;ref name=casestudy /&gt;

'''Rachel Albeck-Gidron''' (born 1960) is an Israeli inter-disciplinary researcher of  Hebrew and comparative [[literature]], [[philosophy]] and [[art]].

==Research==
In her book, ''The Century of the Monads'', Albeck-Gidron claims that there is a deep similarity and even a relationship between [[monadology|monadic]] [[metaphysics]] and the basic assumptions of [[modernism|modernistic]] thought. This claim is demonstrated in 20th-century scientific thought patterns, in the central movements in plastic art from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century and, particularly, in the world view of the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] [[novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=The Century of the Monads: Leibniz's Metaphysics and 20th-Century Modernity |location= |publisher=Bar-Ilan University Press |isbn= |year= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also developed a theoretical model of describing  the process of creation of  textual-versions and created a method of comparing between them, named 'the third text'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=The 3rd text – a theoretical and methodological principle in comparative research, and its application in comparison of the versions of Berdyczewski's story 'Urva Parch' |journal=Sadan |volume=4 |year=2000 |issue= |pages=323–352 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albeck-Gidron examines the [[Ashkenaz]]i [[Pronunciation]] of [[Hebrew]] as a [[Postmodernism|Postmodernistic]] Question, in a part of a [[sociological]] discussion in a problem known as 'invention of tradition'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=Exiled and Suppressed Voices: On the Ashkenazi Pronunciation of Hebrew as a Postmodernistic Question |journal=Jerusalem Studies in Hebrew Literature |volume=19 |issue= |year=2003 |pages=69–90 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also analyzed the work of [[Yoel Hoffmann]] in the light of western and eastern poetics.

Albeck-Gidron is Associate professor of Hebrew literature at [[Bar Ilan University]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biu.ac.il/faculty/tomy/&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, she has been appointed as visiting associate professor at [[Stanford University]] and taught the course "East West East in Israeli Literature: The Novels of Yoel Hoffmann".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/dept/jewishstudies/people/scholars_2006_07.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Albeck-Gidron studied [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] [[painting]] with painter [[Israel Hershberg]] at the [[Jerusalem Studio School]] in [[Jerusalem]].

'''Ratpert of St Gallen''' (c.855 - c.911) was a scholar, writer, chronicler and poet at the [[Abbey of Saint Gall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{HLS|12209|Ratpert|author=Hannes Steiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He wrote in [[Medieval Latin]] and in [[Old High German]].

==Life==
Ratpert probably entered the monastery as an [[oblate]] while still a child.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stotz: ''Ardua spes mundi. Studien zu lateinischen Gedichten aus Sankt Gallen'' (= Geist und Werk der Zeiten. Arbeiten aus dem Historischen Seminar der Universität Zürich, Band 32), Herbert Lang, Bern 1972, {{ISBN|3-261-00431-2}}, S. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;   The monastery operated two schools in parallel:  the "inner school" prepared pupils for the monastic life while the "outer school" trained boys for the secular&lt;ref&gt;"Secular priests" were those working in the churches and parishes outside the monastery walls.&lt;/ref&gt; priesthood.   Ratpert attended the St Gallen [[Monastic school|monastic "inner school"]], so was destined by his schooling to become a monk.

Ratpert's contemporaries in the "Inner School" included [[Notker the Stammerer|Notker the Poet]] and the charismatic poet-polymath [[Tuotilo|Tuotilo of St Gallen]]:  the three later became close colleagues in the monastery.   Meanwhile, an "outer school" contemporary was the combative [[Solomon III (bishop of Constance)|Salomo]], later [[Bishopric of Constance|Bishop of Constance]] and [[Abbey of Saint Gall|Abbot at St Gallen]] itself.   Ratpert's teachers were Iso and the (by provenance Irish) Moengal. Moengal had originally arrived with his uncle Marcus, an [[Episcopi vagantes|itinerant bishop]], when they turned up at St Gallen as pilgrims, visiting the shrine of their compatriot, [[Saint Gall]]us.   The uncle, Marcus, had moved on while Moengal had stayed at St Gallen and entered the monastery.   Here the monks renamed him Marcellus (Little Marcus), recalling the name of his departed uncle.

Ratpert took his own [[Religious vows|monastic vows]] some time round 873.   The earliest surviving example of his writing than can be firmly dated is a [[Legal instrument|legal deed]] dated 29 May 876.   He himself taught at the Monastery School for many years.   The last example of his work as a [[Legal instrument|deed]] writer that can be dated was produced on 10 February 902.   His precise year of death is not known, but has been placed by recent research around 911.  The month and day of his year were 25 October, and his name is recorded under this day in the monastery's Book of the Dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Monumenta Germaniae historica. Necrologia Germaniae'', Band 1: ''Dioeceses Augustensis, Constantiensis, Curiensis'', edited by [[:de:Franz Ludwig Baumann|Franz Ludwig Baumann]], 1866/68, Nachdruck 1983, {{ISBN|3-88612-004-X}}, S. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
In addition to his duties as monastery school master and his activities as a writer of [[Legal instrument|legal records]], Ratpert produced poetry and chronicled the History of [[Abbey of Saint Gall|The Abbey]].   Little of his poetry has survived.

His other works include the [[All Saints' Day]] [[Litany]], "Ardua spes mundi" (''*The World's highest hope"''),)&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced with a German translation in: Peter Stotz: ''Ardua spes mundi. Studien zu lateinischen Gedichten aus Sankt Gallen'' (= Geist und Werk der Zeiten. Arbeiten aus dem Historischen Seminar der Universität Zürich, Band 32), Herbert Lang, Bern 1972, {{ISBN|3-261-00431-2}}, S. 36–41.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Eucharist]] song "Laudes, omnipotens, ferimus" (''"We bring you praise, all powerful one"''),&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced with a German translation in: Peter Stotz: ''Ardua spes mundi. Studien zu lateinischen Gedichten aus Sankt Gallen'' (= Geist und Werk der Zeiten. Arbeiten aus dem Historischen Seminar der Universität Zürich, Band 32), Herbert Lang, Bern 1972, {{ISBN|3-261-00431-2}}, S. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; an  [[Old High German]] "St Gallen Song" and his Chronicle of the Monastery, "Casus sancti Galli" (''literally "The Matter of St Gallen"'').   The Chronicle of the Monastery was subsequently, in the eleventh century, continued by [[Ekkehard IV]] (c.980 - c. 1056) who at the time was also in charge of the Monastery School.   Ratpert's original "St Gallen Song" survives today only in the form of its [[Latin]] translation, which was also penned by [[Ekkehard IV]].

'''''Relativity'''''  is a [[Lithography|lithograph]] print by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[M. C. Escher]], first printed in December 1953. 

It depicts a world in which the normal laws of [[gravity]] do not apply. The architectural structure seems to be the centre of an idyllic community, with most of its inhabitants casually going about their ordinary business, such as dining. There are windows and doorways leading to park-like outdoor settings. All of the figures are dressed in identical attire and have featureless bulb-shaped heads. Identical characters such as these can be found in many other Escher works. 

In the world of ''Relativity'', there are three sources of gravity, each being [[orthogonal]] to the two others. Each inhabitant lives in one of the [[gravity well]]s, where normal physical laws apply. There are sixteen characters, spread between each gravity source, six in one and five each in the other two. The apparent confusion of the lithograph print comes from the fact that the three gravity sources are depicted in the same space.

The structure has seven stairways, and each stairway can be used by people who belong to two different gravity sources. This creates interesting phenomena, such as in the top stairway, where two inhabitants use the same stairway in the same direction and on the same side, but each using a different face of each step; thus, one descends the stairway as the other climbs it, even while moving in the same direction nearly side-by-side. In the other stairways, inhabitants are depicted as climbing the stairways upside-down, but based on their own gravity source, they are climbing normally.

Each of the three parks belongs to one of the gravity wells.  All but one of the doors seem to lead to basements below the parks. Though physically possible, such basements are certainly unusual and add to the surreal effect of the picture.

This is one of Escher’s most popular works and has been used in a [[M. C. Escher in popular culture#Pop culture references to Relativity|variety of ways]].

'''Renaissance Revival''' (sometimes referred to as "'''Neo-Renaissance'''") is a broad designation that covers many 19th century [[Revivalism (architecture)|architectural revival styles]] which were neither Grecian (see [[Greek Revival]]) nor Gothic (see [[Gothic Revival]]) but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes. Under the broad designation "[[Renaissance architecture]]" nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in [[Florence]] and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of [[Humanism]]; they also included styles we would identify as [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] or [[Baroque]]. Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century: "Neo-Renaissance" might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called "[[Italianate]]", or when many [[French Baroque]] features are present ([[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]]).

The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe, particularly in France and Italy, has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture. A comparison between the breadth of its source material, such as the English [[Wollaton Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Wollaton_Hall.html |title=Wollaton Hall |publisher=Greatbuildings.com |date= |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian [[Palazzo Pitti]], the French [[Château de Chambord]], and the Russian [[Palace of Facets]]—all deemed "''Renaissance''"—illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take.

==Origins of Renaissance architecture==
{{main article|Renaissance architecture}}
The origin of Renaissance architecture is generally accredited to [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] (1377–1446)&lt;ref name=copplestone&gt;Copplestone, Trewin (1963). ''World Architecture''. Hamlyn.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|243}} Brunelleschi and his contemporaries wished to bring greater "order" to architecture, resulting in strong symmetry and careful proportion. The movement grew from scientific observations of nature, in particular human anatomy.

Neo-Renaissance architecture is formed by not only the original Italian architecture but by the form in which Renaissance architecture developed in France during the 16th century. During the early years of the 16th century the French were involved in wars in [[northern Italy]], bringing back to France not just the Renaissance art treasures as their war [[treasure|booty]], but also stylistic ideas. In the [[Loire valley]] a wave of [[chateau]] building was carried out using traditional French Gothic styles but with ornament in the forms of pediments, arcades, shallow pilasters and entablatures from the [[Italian Renaissance]].

In England the Renaissance tended to manifest itself in large square tall houses such as [[Longleat House]]. Often these buildings had symmetrical towers which hint at the evolution from medieval fortified architecture. This is particularly evident at [[Hatfield House]] built between 1607 and 1611, where medieval towers jostle with a large Italian cupola. This is why so many buildings of the early English Neo-Renaissance style often have more of a "castle air" than their European contemporaries, which can add again to the confusion with the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival style]].

==Birth of the Neo-Renaissance==
[[File:Mentmore Towers from angle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mentmore Towers]] English [[Jacobethan]] Neo-Renaissance completed in 1854, derives motifs from [[Wollaton Hall]] completed in 1588]]
[[File:Spb 06-2012 Palace Embankment various 09.jpg|thumb|right|Russia: The façade of the [[Vladimir Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] (1867–1872) redolent of [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]]'s designs.]]
[[File:Prague 07-2016 View from Petrinska Tower img4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Czech Republic]]: [[National Theatre (Prague)|Prague, National Theatre]] 1862]]

When in the 19th century Renaissance style architecture came into vogue, it often materialized not just in its original form according to geography, but as a hybrid of all its earlier forms according to the whims of architects and patrons rather than geography and culture. If this were not confusing enough, the new Neo-Renaissance then frequently borrowed architectural elements from the succeeding Mannerist period, and in many cases the even later Baroque period. Mannerism and Baroque being two very opposing [[Architectural style|styles of architecture]]. Mannerism was exemplified by the [[Palazzo del Te]] and Baroque by the [[Wurzburg Residenz]].

Thus Italian, French and Flemish Renaissance coupled with the amount of borrowing from these later periods can cause great difficulty and argument in correctly identifying various forms of 19th-century architecture. Differentiating some forms of French Neo-Renaissance buildings from those of the [[Gothic revival]] can at times be especially tricky, as both styles were simultaneously popular during the 19th century.

[[John Ruskin]]'s panegyrics to architectural wonders of Venice and Florence contributed to shifting "the attention of scholars and designers, with their awareness heightened by debate and restoration work"&lt;ref&gt;Rosanna Pavoni. ''Reviving the Renaissance: The Use and Abuse of the Past in Nineteenth-Century Italian Art''. Cambridge University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-521-48151-1}}. Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--the work is available online through Google Books.--&gt; from [[Neoclassicism|Late Neoclassicism]] and Gothic Revival to the Italian Renaissance. As a consequence, a self-consciously "Neo-Renaissance" manner first began to appear circa 1840. By 1890 this movement was already in decline. [[The Hague]]'s [[Peace Palace]] completed in 1913, in a heavy French Neo-Renaissance manner was one of the last notable buildings in this style.

[[Charles Barry]] introduced the Neo-Renaissance to England with his design of the [[Travellers Club]], [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] (1829–1832). Other early but typical, domestic examples of the Neo-Renaissance include [[Mentmore Towers]] and the [[Château de Ferrières]], both designed in the 1850s by [[Joseph Paxton]] for members of the [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] banking family. The style is characterized by original Renaissance [[Motif (art)|motifs]], taken from such Quattrocento architects as [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]]. These motifs included [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] masonry and [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]], windows framed by [[architrave]]s and doors crowned by [[pediment]]s and [[entablature]]s. If a building were of several floors, the uppermost floor usually had small square windows representing the minor [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine floor]] of the original Renaissance designs. However, the Neo-renaissance style later came to incorporate [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Baroque]] features not found in the original Renaissance architecture which was often more severe in its design.

Like all architectural styles, the Neo-Renaissance did not appear overnight fully formed but evolved slowly. One of the very first signs of its emergence was the [[Würzburg]] Women's Prison, which was erected in 1809 designed by [[Peter Speeth]]. It included a heavily rusticated ground floor, alleviated by one semicircular arch, with a curious [[Egypt]]ian style miniature [[portico]] above, high above this were a sequence of six tall arched windows and above these just beneath the slightly projecting roof were the small windows of the upper floor. This building foreshadows similar effects in the work of the American architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] whose work in the Neo-Renaissance style was popular in the USA during the 1880s. Richardson's style at the end or the revival era was a severe mix of both Romanesque and Renaissance features.&lt;ref name=copplestone /&gt;{{rp|300–318}} This was exemplified by his "Marshall Field Warehouse" in [[Chicago]] (completed in 1887, now demolished).

However, while the beginning of  Neo-Renaissance period can be defined by its simplicity and severity, what came between was far more ornate in its design. This period can be defined by some of the great [[opera house]]s of Europe, such as [[Gottfried Semper]]'s Burgtheater in Vienna, and his Opera house in [[Dresden]]. This ornate form of the Neo-Renaissance, originating from France,&lt;ref name=copplestone /&gt;{{rp|311}} is sometimes known as the "Second Empire" style, by now it also incorporated some [[Baroque]] elements. By 1875 it had become the accepted style in Europe for all public and bureaucratic buildings.&lt;ref name=copplestone /&gt;{{rp|p. 311; caption 938}} In England, where Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]] designed the London [[Foreign Office]] in this style between 1860 and 1875, it also incorporated certain [[Palladian]] features.

Starting with the [[orangery]] of [[Sanssouci]] (1851), "the Neo-Renaissance became the obligatory style for university and public buildings, for banks and financial institutions, and for the urban villas" in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Modern German Culture''. Cambridge University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-521-56870-6}}. Page 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most accomplished examples of the style were Villa Meyer in Dresden, [[Villa Haas]] in [[Hesse]], Palais Borsig in [[Berlin]], Villa Meissner in [[Leipzig]]; the German version of Neo-Renaissance culminated in such turgid projects as the Town Hall in [[Hamburg]] (1886–1897) and the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in Berlin (completed in 1894).

In Austria, it was pioneered by such illustrious names as [[Rudolf Eitelberger]], the founder of the Viennese College of Arts and Crafts (today the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]]). The style found particular favour in [[Vienna]], where whole streets and blocks were built in the so-called Neo-Renaissance style, in reality, a classicizing conglomeration of elements liberally borrowed from different historical periods.

[[File:Andrássy út Budapest 1896.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andrássy Avenue]] with the [[Hungarian State Opera House]] in 1896]]
[[File:Institute of Technology (today Eötvös Loránd University), Budapest.jpg|thumb|right|Institute of Technology (today [[Eötvös Loránd University]]), [[Budapest]] by [[Imre Steindl]]]]

Neo-Renaissance was also the favourite style in [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 1870s and 1880s. In the fast-growing capital, [[Budapest]] many monumental public buildings were built in Neo-Renaissance style like [[Saint Stephen's Basilica]] and the [[Hungarian State Opera House]]. [[Andrássy Avenue]] is an outstanding ensemble of Neo-Renaissance townhouses from the last decades of the 19th century. The most famous Hungarian architect of the age, [[Miklós Ybl]] preferred Neo-Renaissance in his works.

In Russia, the style was pioneered by [[Auguste de Montferrand]] in the [[:File:Demidovhouse.jpg|Demidov House]] (1835), the first in [[Saint Petersburg]] to take "a story-by-story approach to façade ornamentation, in contrast to the classical method, where the façade was conceived as a unit".&lt;ref name=buckler&gt;Julie A. Buckler. ''Mapping St. Petersburg: Imperial Text and Cityshape''. Princeton University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-691-11349-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} [[Konstantin Thon]], the most popular Russian architect of the time, used Italianate elements profusely for decorating some interiors of the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] (1837–1851). Another fashionable architect, [[Andrei Shtakenschneider|Andrei Stackensneider]], was responsible for [[Marie Palace]] (1839–1844), with "the faceted rough-hewn stone of the first floor" reminiscent of 16th-century Italian palazzi.&lt;ref name=buckler /&gt;{{rp|45}}

[[File:The Breakers Newport.jpg|right|thumb|United States: [[The Breakers]], [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], 1893]]

The style was further elaborated by architects of the [[Vladimir Palace]] (1867–1872) and culminated in the [[Stieglitz Museum]] (1885–1896). In [[Moscow]], the Neo-Renaissance was less prevalent than in the Northern capital, although interiors of the neo-Muscovite [[Moscow City Hall|City Duma]] (1890–1892) were executed with emphasis on Florentine and Venetian décor. While the Neo-Renaissance is associated primarily with secular buildings, Princes [[Yusupov]] commissioned the interior of [[:File:Arkhang.jpg|their palace church]] (1909–1916) near [[Moscow]] to be decorated in strict imitation of the 16th-century Venetian churches.

The style spread to [[North America]], where it became a favourite domestic architectural style of the wealthiest Americans. [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], was a residence of the [[Vanderbilt family]] designed by [[Richard Morris Hunt]] in 1892; it and contemporaneous [[Gilded Age]] mansions exemplify the ambitions of wealthy Americans in equaling and surpassing the ostentatious lifestyles of European aristocrats. During the latter half of the 19th century [[Fifth Avenue|5th Avenue]] in [[New York City]] was lined with "Renaissance" French chateaux and Italian [[palazzo|palazzi]], all designed in Neo-Renaissance styles. Most of these have since been demolished.

==Features of Renaissance Revival architecture==
[[File:France Loir-et-Cher Chambord Chateau 04.jpg|thumb|left|159px|A [[Renaissance]] staircase at the [[Château de Chambord]] completed in 1547. Variations of this design became a popular feature of the Neo-Renaissance.(''See Waddesdon illustrated right'')]]
[[File:Hotel de Ville de Paris, West view, cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Paris [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] completed circa 1880 in an unequivocal French Neo-Renaissance style.]]

One of the most widely copied features of Renaissance architecture were the great staircases from the chateaux of [[Chateau de Blois|Blois]] and [[Château de Chambord|Chambord]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=27457&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Chateau de Chambord] retrieved 19 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Blois had been the favourite residence of the [[List of French monarchs|French Kings]] throughout the renaissance. The [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] wing, completed in 1524,  of which the staircase is an integral part was one of the earliest examples of [[French Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castles.org/castles/Europe/Western_Europe/France/france110.htm |title=Chateau de Blois |publisher=Castles.org |date= |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; French renaissance architecture was a combination of the earlier [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style coupled with a strong Italian influence represented by arches, arcades, balustrading and, in general, a more flowing line of design than had been apparent in the earlier Gothic. The Chateau de Blois's triumphal staircase was imitated almost from the moment of its completion, and was certainly the predecessor of the "double staircase" (sometimes attributed to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]) at the [[Château de Chambord]] just a few years later.

A Grand Staircase whether based on that of Blois, or the [[Villa Farnese]] was to become one of the features of Neo-Renaissance design. It became a common feature for the staircase to be not just a feature of the internal architecture but also the external. But whereas at Blois the stairs had been open to the elements in the 19th century new and innovative use of glass was able to give protection from the weather, giving the staircase the appearance of being in the true renaissance open style, when it was in fact a truly internal feature. Further and more adventurous use of glass also enabled the open and arcaded Renaissance courtyards to be reproduced as lofty halls with glazed roofs. This was a feature at Mentmore Towers and on a far larger scale at the  [[Warsaw University of Technology]], where the large glazed court contained a monumental staircase. The "Warsaw University of Technology staircase", though if Renaissance in spirit at all, is more in the lighter, more [[column]]ed style of [[Ottaviano Nonni]]'s (named il Mascherino) staircase designed for [[Pope]] [[Gregory XIII]] at Rome's [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo Quirinale]] in 1584, thus demonstrating that architects wherever their location were selecting their Neo-Renaissance styles reardless of geography

==Combined historicism==

===Gothic influences on the Renaissance Revival===

[[File:Neorenaissancedoor.gif|thumb|right|150px|This Renaissance Revival doorway illustrates a [[French Gothic architecture|Gothic]] influence on French Renaissance design. A basket-handle portal is surmounted by a floral [[ogee]] hood moulding.]]

Gothic influences on both period and revived Renaissance architecture are readily apparent, first as much building occurred during the period of transition from the Gothic to the Renaissance style; and also as Renaissance−era design took the form of the addition of Renaissance ornamentation to Gothic−era buildings thus creating an accretion of details from disparate sources. Architects who designed in the Renaissance Revival style usually avoided any references to [[Gothic Revival]] architecture, drawing instead on a variety of other classically based styles. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  However, there are exceptions and occasionally the two distinct styles are mixed. The sub-variety of Gothic design most frequently employed is floral [[Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian Gothic]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}, as seen in the [[Doge's Palace#Courtyard|Doge's Palace]] courtyard, built in the 1480s.

===Baroque influences on the Renaissance Revival===
[[File:Wut-interior.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The staircase at the [[Warsaw University of Technology]], with strong [[Baroque Revival architecture|Baroque Revival]] influences.]]
{{See also|Baroque Revival architecture}}
A common [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] feature introduced into the Renaissance Revival styles was the "imperial staircase" (a single straight flight dividing into two separate flights).

The [[staircase]] at [[Mentmore Towers]] designed by Joseph Paxton, and the one at the [[Warsaw University of Technology]] designed by Bronisław Rogóyski and Stefan Szyller (late 19th century), both rise from [[pastiche]]s of true Renaissance courtyards. Both staircases seem more akin to [[Balthasar Neumann]]'s great Baroque staircase at the [[Würzburg Residenz]] than anything found in a true Renaissance Palazzo. The apparent Baroque style staircase at Mentmore is not without a Renaissance influence, its first flight is similar to "The staircase of the Giants" rises from the Doge's Palace Courtyard, designed when the Venetian Gothic was being uncomfortably merged with Renaissance style. Similarly to that at Mentmore, the Staircase of the Giant's terminates on to an arcaded loggia. Perhaps not ironically the Hall and Staircase at Mentmore were designed by Paxton to display furniture formerly housed in the Doge's Palace.

Paris is home to many historicist buildings that partake equally from Renaissance and Baroque source material, such as the [[Opera Garnier]]. However, the Parisian [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] faithfully replicates the true [[French Renaissance architecture|French Renaissance]] style, complete with the steeply pitched roofs and towers, as it was a reconstruction, completed circa 1880, of the previous Hôtel de Ville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviewoncities.com/paris/hoteldeville.htm |title=Hôtel de Ville |publisher=Aviewoncities.com |date= |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[British Raj]] in 1880, the [[façade]]s of the 1777 [[Writers' building]] in [[Kolkata]] were redesigned in the Renaissance Revival style then popular in colonial India, though this version was remarkable in its unique design. Loggias of [[Palladian window|Serlian arches]] deceptively form an almost Indian appearance, yet they sit beneath a [[Mansard]] roof. In what at first glance appears an Indian building, on closer examination shows a Historicist example of Classical [[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]] combined with the French Renaissance, a uniquely distinctive interpretation of the Renaissance Revival style.

==Renaissance Revival interiors==
[[File:Hubert Robert 003.jpg|thumb|right|350px|True [[Renaissance]]: The [[Villa Farnese]]: the curved staircase, tall segmented windows, and marble [[baluster|balustrading]] were all features frequently reproduced in the 19th century revival.]]

As mentioned above, the Neo-Renaissance style was in reality an eclectic blending of past styles, which the architect selected on the whims of his patrons. In the true Renaissance era there was a [[division of labour]] between the architect, who designed the exterior highly visible shell, and others—the artisans—who decorated and arranged the interior.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"&gt;Dal Lago, Adalbert (1966). ''Ville Antiche''. Milan: Fratelli Fabbri.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Italian mannerist house was a place for relaxation and entertaining, convenience and comfort of the interior being a priority; in the later Baroque designs, comfort and [[interior design]] were secondary to outward appearance. This was followed by the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] period, which gave importance to the proportions and dignity of interiors, but still lost the comfort and internal convenience of the mannerist period. It was during the Neo-Renaissance period of the 19th century that the mannerist comforts were re-discovered and taken a step further. Not only did the improved building techniques of the 1850s allow the [[glass|glazing]] of formerly open [[loggia]]s and [[arch]]es with the newly invented sheets of plate glass, providing the first "picture windows", but also the blending of architectural styles allowed interiors and exteriors to be treated differently. It was at this time that the concept of "furnishing styles" manifested itself, allowing distinctions to be made between interior rooms and external appearances, and indeed between the various rooms themselves.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966" /&gt; Thus the modern concept of treating a room individually, and differently from its setting and neighbours, came into its infancy. Classic examples of this are the great [[Rothschild properties in Buckinghamshire|Rothschild house in Buckinghamshire]], [[Cross-genre|hybrids]] of various Renaissance [[chateau]]x, and 16th century [[English country house]]s, all  with interiors ranging from "Versailles" to "[[Medici]]", and in the case of Mentmore Towers a huge central hall, resembling the arcaded courtyard of a Renaissance villa, conveniently glazed over, furnished in [[Venice|Venetian]] style and heated by a fireplace designed by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] for his house in Antwerp&lt;ref&gt;Sotheby's. ''Mentmore''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:NatWestLB.JPG|thumb|right|Provincial Neo-Renaissance English style: the [[NatWest]] Bank at Leighton Buzzard, [[Bedfordshire]], England is an example of the manner in which Neo-Renaissance architecture evolved among lesser architects in more modest surroundings as it gained in popularity.]]

By the beginning of the 20th century Neo-Renaissance was a commonplace sight on the main streets of thousands of towns, large and small around, the world. In [[southern Europe]] the  Neo-Renaissance  style began to fall from favour circa 1900. However, it was still extensively practiced in the 1910s in [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Buenos Aires]] by such architects as [[Leon Benois]], [[Marian Peretyatkovich]], or [[Francisco Tamburini]] ([[:File:Buenos Aires-ColonTeatre-P3050009.jpg|picture]]).

In England it was so common that  today one finds "Renaissance Italian Palazzi" serving as banks or municipal buildings in the centres of even the smallest towns. It has been said "''It is a well-known fact that the nineteenth century had no art style of its own.''"&lt;ref&gt;Lessenich, Rolf P. [https://web.archive.org/web/20041116165123/http://www.uni-erfurt.de/eestudies/eese/artic24/rless/1_2004.html "Ideals Versus Realities: Nineteenth-Century Decadent Identity and the Renaissance"].  2004-01. Accessed 10 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  While to an extent this may be true, the same could be said of most eras until the early 20th century, the Neo-Renaissance in the hands of provincial architects did develop into a style not always instantly recognisable as a derivative of the Renaissance. In this less obvious guise the Neo-Renaissance was to provide an important undercurrent in totalitarian architecture of various countries, notably in [[Stalinist architecture]] of the [[Soviet Union]], as seen in some pavilions of the [[All-Soviet Exhibition Centre]].

[[File:Yar april 16.jpg|center|thumb|Neo-Renaissance Russian style: a little recorded, Neo-Renaissance building showing [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] influences in [[Yaroslavl]], Russia.]]

Neo-Renaissance architecture, because of its diversity, is perhaps the only style of architecture to have existed in so many forms, yet still common to so many countries.

tribal painting is a style of wall [[mural painting]]s associated with the [[Sauda people|Sauda tribals]] of the [[Odisha|state of Odisha]] in [[India]].  These paintings, also called ''ikons'' (or ''ekons'') are visually similar to [[Warli painting]]s and hold religious significance for the Sauras.

== The Saura tribe ==
[[File:Saura Lady.JPG|thumb|A Saura woman]]

Sauras are among the most ancient of [[Tribes of India|tribes in India]] and find mention in the [[Hindu epic]]s of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. Savari, [[Lord Rama|Rama’s]] devotee in the Ramayana and Jara, the hunter who mortally wounded [[Lord Krishna|Krishna]] with an arrow, are thought to have been members of this tribe. Jara’s body is believed to have flowed into the sea near [[Puri]] as a wooden log and the idol [[Jagannath]] at [[Puri Jagannadh|Puri]] is believed to have been sculpted from it.&lt;ref name="orissa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=C B|title=The Sauras and Their Panoramic Paintings|journal=Orissa Review|date=January 2005|page=53|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/jan2005/englishPdf/Souras_Paintings.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saura paintings are an integral part of the religious ceremonies of the Saura tribals and are found in the southern Odisha districts of [[Rayagada district|Rayagada]], [[Ganjam district|Ganjam]], [[Gajapati district|Gajapati]] and [[Koraput district|Koraput]].&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Painting workshop for school dropouts|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/painting-workshop-for-school-dropouts/article1166748.ece?textsize=large&amp;test=1|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saura paintings were first studied by the famous anthropologist [[Verrier Elwin]].&lt;ref name="orissa" /&gt;

== Paintings ==
The Saura [[wall painting]]s are called ''italons'' or ''ikons'' (or ''ekons'') and are dedicated to [[Idital]] (also ''edital'') the main deity of the Sauras. These paintings draw upon tribal folklore and have ritualistic importance. Ikons make extensive use of symbolically pregnant icons that mirror the quotidian chores of the Sauras. People, [[horses]], [[elephants]], the [[sun]] and the [[moon]] and the [[tree of life]] are recurring [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] in these ikons. Ikons were originally painted on the walls of the Saura's adobe huts. The paintings' backdrop is prepared from red or [[yellow ochre]] earth which is then painted over using brushes fashioned from tender [[Bamboo Shoots|bamboo shoots]]. Ekons use natural dyes and chromes derived from ground white stone, hued earth, and [[vermilion]] and mixtures of [[tamarind]] seed, flower and leaf extracts.&lt;ref name="deccanherald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Timeless images|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/191569/timeless-images.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=Deccan Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ikons are worshipped during special religious and cultural occasions such as child-birth, harvest, marriage and the construction of a new house. Ikons are not commissioned frequently and an existing one can be regularly used for mundane rituals. The building of a new dwelling however necessitates the commissioning of an ekon, which is painted in a dark corner inside the home where its creation is accompanied by the recital of a specific set of prayers. Traditionally, Kudangs, the priestly class among the Sauras, painted the ikons since they also had the expertise to explain the symbolic import of the images contained therein to the villagers. Thus the ikons also became a part of the aural tradition of the Sauras that linked them to their traditions and customs. Today the Kudangs have been supplanted by artists and paintings are often executed in non-traditional locales.&lt;ref name="hindu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="deccanherald" /&gt;

== Comparison with Warli paintings ==
[[File:A Warli painting by Jivya Soma Mashe, Thane district.jpg|thumb|200px|Warli painting from [[Thane district]]]]

Saura paintings have a striking visual semblance to [[Warli painting|Warli art]] and both use clear geometric frames for their construction but they differ in both their style and treatment of subjects. In Saura paintings, a fish-net approach - of painting from the border inwards - is used while this not the case with Warli paintings.&lt;ref name="hindu" /&gt; Although both are examples of tribal [[pictograph]]s that employ [[stick figures]], Warli paintings use conjoint triangles to depict the human body while the figures are not as sharply delineated in Saura paintings. Also, unlike the Warli paintings where male and female icons are clearly distinguishable, in Saura art there is no such physical differentiation.&lt;ref name="deccanherald" /&gt;

== Saura paintings today ==
[[File:Idital Wall Painting.jpg|thumb|200px|Idital-Soura Painting]]
Their diversity, detail and unique style have given ikons an 'in-vogue-appeal' and increasing popularity in recent years. The influence of markets and increasing awareness about the other’s forms have led to both Saura and Warli paintings picking up details of technique and style from the other.&lt;ref name="hindu" /&gt; They have also been popularised in recent times as an avenue for skill and job creation&lt;ref name="thehindu" /&gt; and have increasingly been used to decorate items like T-shirts, greeting cards, stationery and items of clothing.&lt;ref name="thehindu_a" /&gt;

[[File:Section_break_01_by_Pengo.jpg|thumb|Open pages of the book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', showing an ornate section break on the lower left page created from [[asterisk]]s. It is used to signal a pause for the reader and a [[transition (fiction)|transition]] in the narrative.]]
In [[book]]s and [[document]]s, a '''section''' is a subdivision, especially of a [[Chapter (books)|chapter]]. 

Sections are visually separated from each other with a '''section break''', typically consisting of extra space between the sections, and sometimes also by a '''section heading''' for the latter section. They are a concern in the process of [[typography]] and [[pagination]], where it may be desirable to have a [[page break]] follow a section break for the sake of aesthetics or readability.

In [[fiction]], sections often represent [[Scene (drama)|scenes]], and accordingly the space separating them is sometimes also called a  '''scene break'''.

==Section form and numbering==

In written narrative such as fiction, sections are not usually numbered or named. Section breaks are used to signal various changes in a story, including changes in time, location, [[Point of view (fiction)|point-of-view character]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], [[tone (literature)|tone]], [[emotion]], and [[pace (speed)|pace]]. As a [[fiction-writing mode]], the section break can be considered a [[transition (fiction)|transition]], similar to a chapter break.

Some documents, especially legal documents, may have numbered sections, such as ''[[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' or ''[[Internal Revenue Code section 183]]''. The [[section sign]] (§) may be used to reference sections and subsections. Subsections are often written in lowercase [[Roman numerals]], e.g. [[Section 51(xxvi) of the Australian Constitution]].

A document may also be considered to be divided into sections by its headings and subheadings, which may be used for a [[table of contents]]. For example, the hierarchical sections used in [[Wikipedia]] can be compiled into a table of contents for an article. Many books, however, only have chapter headings in the table of contents.

While a chapter may be divided by section breaks, a group of chapters is conventionally called a "part", often identified with a Roman numeral, e.g. "Part II".

Reference material may be divided into sections. The [[section headers of a Chinese dictionary]] are one example.

== Flourished section breaks ==

Space between paragraphs in a section break is sometimes accompanied by an [[Asterism (typography)|asterism]] (either proper ⁂ or manual * * *), a horizontal rule, [[fleuron (typography)|fleuron]]s, or other ornamental symbols. An ornamental symbol used as section break does not have a generally accepted name. Such a typographic device can be specifically referred to as ''dinkus'', ''space break symbol'', ''paragraph separator'', ''paragraph divider'', ''horizontal divider'', ''thought break'', or as an instance of ''filigree'' or ''flourish''. Ornamental section breaks can be created using [[glyph]]s, rows of [[lozenge]]s, [[dingbat]]s, or other [[miscellaneous symbols]]. Fonts such as [[Webdings]] and [[Wingdings]] include many such glyphs.

In [[HTML]], horizontal rules can be generated using the &lt;code&gt;hr&lt;/code&gt; tag, which generates a paragraph-level thematic break. For more ornate presentation, [[CSS]] can be used to replace the line with an image.

'''''Spice Chess''''' is an [[artist's multiple]] by the [[Japan]]ese artist [[Takako Saito]], while she was resident in the [[United States]]. Originally manufactured winter 1964-65, and offered for sale March 1965,&lt;ref&gt;Offered in Vacuum TrapEzoid Fluxus Newspaper #5, March 1965&lt;/ref&gt; the work is one of a famous series of disrupted chess sets referred to as ''Fluxchess'' or ''Flux Chess'', made for [[George Maciunas|George Maciunas']] [[Fluxus|Fluxshop]] at his [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]] loft, [[SoHo]], [[New York City]] and later through his Fluxus Mail-Order Warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/research/researchservices/archive/archive_mayor.htm Tate Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110140636/http://www.tate.org.uk/research/researchservices/archive/archive_mayor.htm |date=2005-11-10 }} Retrieved 03-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Takako Saito engaged with Duchamp's practice but also with masculinist cold war metaphors by taking up chess as a subject of [her] art. Saito's fluxchess works... question the primacy of vision to chess, along with notions of perception and in aesthetic experience more generally.... Her "Smell Chess," "Sound Chess" and "Weight Chess" reworked the game of chess so that players would be forced to hone non-visual perception, such as the olfactory sense, tactility, and aurality, in order to follow chess rules." Claudia Mesch&lt;ref&gt;[http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/mesch.shtml Reconstruction, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713171331/http://reconstruction.eserver.org/061/mesch.shtml |date=2012-07-13 }} Retrieved 03-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The set follows the normal rules of [[chess]], but replaces the traditional pieces with identically-shaped transparent plastic [[vial]]s filled with different spices for each of the different pieces. The set includes white [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]] made of [[Cinnamon]], white [[Rook (chess)|rooks]] of [[Nutmeg]], the white [[Knight (chess)|knights]] are [[Ginger]], black [[Bishop (chess)|bishops]], [[Cumin]] and the Black [[King (chess)|King]] made of [[Asafoetida]]. The white [[Queen (chess)|Queen]] is [[Anise]], the black [[Cayenne pepper]].&lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt; The board is also made of transparent plastic. To start the game, both players have to familiarise themselves with each of the 12 smells involved, instead of the more normal reliance on sight.

==Ay-O and George Maciunas==
As a 'basically untrained' &lt;ref name="Tokyo"/&gt; artist in [[Tokyo]], Saito's opportunities to exhibit work were severely limited.&lt;ref name="Tokyo"/&gt; After taking English lessons, Saito arrived in New York in 1963 on a work visa as an assistant textile wholesaler, 'vaguely [dreaming] of engaging herself in the unknown New York avant-garde'.&lt;ref name="Tokyo"&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p119&lt;/ref&gt; Unaware of Fluxus, she concentrated on her own work for a few months before meeting George Maciunas through a mutual friend, [[Ay-O]]. An admirer of Japanese art, Maciunas asked Saito if she could make boxes similar to the [[Paulownia]] boxes he owned, which had been made to protect expensive ceramics.&lt;ref name="Perform"&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005/p122&lt;/ref&gt; Her skill exceeded expectations, leading him to write that 'her craftmanship springs from Japanese tradition for perfection and is unmatched among contemporary artists working in wood and paper.' &lt;ref&gt;Maciunas, quoted in Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GrinderChess.jpg|thumb|left|270px|''Grinder Chess'', 1965 This example Reflux  Edition, 1990]]

===''Fluxchess''===
Maciunas revered [[Marcel Duchamp]], and 'found it amusing that both Duchamp and he were chess fanatics.'&lt;ref&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p123&lt;/ref&gt; As a homage to Duchamp's assertion that 'all chess players are artists',&lt;ref&gt;'I have come to the conclusion that while all artists are not chess players, all chess players are artists' Marcel Duchamp. quoted [http://www.uschesstrust.org/WP/?p=496 US Chess Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017002910/http://uschesstrust.org/WP/?p=496 |date=2007-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maciunas asked Saito to create a series of artworks based on chess in late 1964. The series she created relegated or removed the dominant visual aspect of the game, replacing it with sets that relied upon the honing of other senses to play. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'In Saito's chess, strategy is undermined by the physical need to utilize the five senses...by involving senses that were normally unrelated to the traditional game, Saito transformed the ultimate conceptual game into a play of sensuous interactions.' &lt;ref&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p126&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As well as ''Spice Chess'', the series includes ''Sound Chess'' (different objects hidden in identical sealed boxes), ''Grinder Chess'' (a series of tactile drill bit polishers), ''Weight Chess'' (different weights hidden in sealed boxes), ''Nut &amp; Bolt Chess'' (the only known example having been lost &lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt;), ''Jewel Chess'', (made from different fake jewels) and ''Smell Chess'' (different liquids in vials). All of these sets were advertised for sale in Maciunas' Fluxus shop in SoHo, March 1965.&lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;All of these sets were mentioned in Vacuum Trapezoid #5, March 1965, but it is possible that some were never actually manufactured.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When I gave all the chess sets to George, I said, 'he can use them as fluxus chess without mentioning my name." Takako Saito &lt;ref&gt;Takako Saito, quoted in Fluxus Codex, p456&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Maciunas was said to be so delighted by ''Spice Chess'' that he 'even took credit for it on occasion.' &lt;ref name="Codex"&gt;Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Abrams, 1989 p461&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later ''Fluxchess'' sets and Yoko Ono's ''White Chess Set''===
Other ''Fluxchess'' sets were made by Maciunas (''Color Balls in Bottle Board Chess'', March 1966 and ''Time Chess'' made of sand timers, May 1966) and by [[Yoko Ono]], (''Pieces Hidden In Look-a-Like Containers'' intended for the Fluxfest April 1970 &lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Munroe, p136, this work 'appears not to have been realized'&lt;/ref&gt; Saito added ''Chess Board Door'' to the series in 1973, in which a chess board was to be attached to a toilet door allowing for a game to continue whilst one of the players was on the loo, and ''Liquor Chess'', 1975 (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20110528054212/http://cms.ifa.de/en/exhibitions/exhibitions-abroad/bk/fluxus/ausgewaehlte-werke/takako-saito]) in which players have to taste various different drinks to ascertain each piece's value. ''Wine Chess'' and ''Book Chess'' have been added to the series since Maciunas' death.

The most famous of these disrupted sets, Yoko Ono's ''White Chess Set'' (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20081204062531/http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage Yoko Ono's Myspace] ), in which all the pieces are white on a totally white board (with a brass plaque underneath reading 'Chess Set for playing as long as you can remember where all your pieces are' &lt;ref&gt;Into Performance, Yoshimoto, Rutgers University Press, 2005 p128&lt;/ref&gt;) was originally made for Ono's exhibition at [[Indica Gallery]], London, 1966, and was never produced as a Fluxus edition.&lt;ref&gt;Yes, Ono &amp; Munroe, Harry N Abrams, 2000, p136&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Yoko Ono's ''White Chess Set'', in which the opponents' pieces, all white, sit on each side of an all-white board, [make] the warring factions indistinguishable from one another. This elegantly placed anti-war statement, particularly taken in the context of the Vietnam War...[draws] attention to the deeply militaristic metaphors embedded in... games by conscientiously objecting to their implicit narratives of combat and enmity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3982/is_200601/ai_n17183604/pg_10?tag=artBody;col1 Visible Language by Celia Pearce, 2006 on BNet Online], retrieved 03-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The piece has been reconfigured a number of times, including an edition of 20 produced by Bag Productions, UK, 1970, and as ''Play It By Trust'', a white table with ten sets and twenty white chairs laid out at the Vrej Baghoomian Gallery, New York, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Yes, Ono &amp; Munroe, Harry N Abrams, 2000, p138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SmellChess-Tate.jpg|thumb|right|270px|''Smell Chess'' being played at Tate Modern, May 2008]]

===Editions===
The sets were originally sold through Maciunas' newly opened Fluxshop in unsigned, unattributed and unnumbered editions. At least one set, ''Grinder Chess'', was remade in an edition of 19 signed and numbered in 1990 as part of the ''Reflux'' editions series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oto-housebooks.com/fluxus%20&amp;%20happening.html Oto housebooks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502045432/http://www.oto-housebooks.com/fluxus%20%26%20happening.html |date=2008-05-02 }} retrieved 03-10-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Hendrick's seminal ''Fluxus Codex'' was published in 1989, there was a general confusion concerning dates and authorship of the key Fluxus pieces, since few were ever sold, and even fewer were signed or dated. Saito's place within the group has gradually become more established, and the playing of ''Fluxchess'' has become an integral part of a number of recent Fluxus exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/thelongweekend2008/ Tate Modern, Long Weekend 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006204930/http://tate.org.uk/modern/thelongweekend2008/ |date=2008-10-06 }} retrieved 03-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt; An original example of ''Spice Chess'' is one of a number of ''Fluxchess'' sets held in the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection, [[Detroit]], Michigan.

'''Squatting in England and Wales''' usually refers to a person who is not the owner, taking possession of land or an empty house. People [[squatting|squat]] for a variety of reasons which include needing a home,&lt;ref name="Reeve"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many squats are residential, some are also opened as [[social centres]].

There have been waves of squatting through British history. The BBC states that squatting was "a big issue in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381 and again for the [[Diggers]] in the 17th Century [who] were peasants who cultivated waste and common land, claiming it as their rightful due" and that squatting was a necessity after the [[Second World War]] when so many were homeless.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14030336 ''Squatters: Who are they and why do they squat?''], BBC&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent wave began in the late 1960s in the midst of a housing crisis.

Many squatters legalised their homes or projects in the 1980s, for example [[Bonnington Square]] and [[Frestonia]] in London. More recently, there are still isolated examples such as the [[The Invisible Circus (circus troupe)|Invisible Circus]] in Bristol.

Under Section 144 of the [[Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012]], squatting in residential property became a criminal offence on 1 September 2012.&lt;ref name=squattingillegal&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19429936 Squatting set to become a criminal offence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/legislation/bills-acts/circulars/squatting-circular.pdf Ministry of Justice Circular No. 2012/04 - Offence of Squatting In a Residential Building]&lt;/ref&gt; Squatting in non-residential property may be a civil or a criminal matter, depending upon the circumstances,&lt;ref name="crimlaw1977"&gt;[[Criminal Law Act 1977]] section 6&lt;/ref&gt; and repossession by the owners, occupiers or intended occupiers may require legal process or police action.

==History==
===16th- and 17th-century===
In 16th- and 17th-century Wales, an expansion in population as well as [[taxation]] policy led to a move of people into the Welsh countryside, where they squatted on [[common land]]. These squatters built their own property under the assumption of a fictional piece of folklore, leading to the developments of small holdings around a [[Tŷ unnos]], or "house in a night".

In [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan times]], there was a common belief, that if a house was erected by a squatter and their friends on waste ground overnight, then they had the right of undisturbed possession.&lt;ref name=Harrison135&gt;Harrison. The Common People. p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; To make it difficult for squatters to build, an act was passed known as the [[Erection of Cottages Act 1588]]  whereby a cottage could only be built as long as it had a minimum of {{convert|4|acre|ha sqmi|2|lk=on}} of land associated with it.&lt;ref name=Harrison135/&gt;&lt;ref name=statute664&gt;Basket. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2KZFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA664&amp;dq=%22An+act+against+erecting+and+maintaining+cottages%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rt2cUqL2JIuqhAe9toBI&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22An%20act%20against%20erecting%20and%20maintaining%20cottages%22&amp;f=false Statutes at Large.] Retrieved 10 November 2014 p. 664&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1649 at St George's Hill, [[Weybridge]] in [[Surrey]], [[Gerrard Winstanley]] and others calling themselves The [[Diggers|True Levellers]] occupied disused [[common land]] and cultivated it collectively in the hope that their actions would inspire other poor people to follow their lead. Gerrard Winstanley stated that "the poorest man hath as true a title and just right to the land as the richest man".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Ed. Wates and Wolmar (1980)''Squatting: The Real Story'' (Bay Leaf Books) {{ISBN|0-9507259-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the True Levellers, later more commonly known as the Diggers, were perhaps not the first squatters in England, their story illustrates the heritage of squatting as a form of radical direct action.

===Post World War II===
There was a huge squatting movement involving ex-servicemen and their families following [[World War II]]. In Brighton, [[Harry Cowley]] and the Vigilantes installed families in empty properties and all around the country, in London suburbs and villages such as Chalfont St Giles families occupied derelict camps and in some cases stayed there until the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpathe.com/video/chalfont-st-giles Chalfont St Giles 1946]&lt;/ref&gt; As word spread, more and more people squatted until there were an estimated 45,000 in total.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton, J. 'Self-help and Socialism The Squatters' Movement of 1946' in ''History Workshop Journal'' (1988) 25(1): 100-126.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October, [[Aneurin Bevan]] reported to the House of Commons that 1,038 camps in England and Wales were occupied by 39,535 people.&lt;ref name="Webber, H. 2012 pp125-146"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Webber |first=H. |url=https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/collegeofhumanities/history/exhistoria/volume4/Webber-Squatters_movement.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Domestic Rebellion: The Squatters' Movement of 1946 |journal=Ex Historia |year=2012 |volume=4 |pages=125&amp;ndash;146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the Government prevaricated, there was considerable public support for the squatters, since they were perceived as honest people simply taking action to house themselves. [[Clementine Churchill]], wife of the ex-Prime Minister, commented in August 1946: "These people are referred to by the ungraceful term 'squatters', and I wish the press would not use this word about respectable citizens whose only desire is to have a home."&lt;ref name="Webber, H. 2012 pp125-146"/&gt;

On 8 September 1946, 1,500 people squatted flats in Kensington, Pimlico and St.Johns Wood. This action, termed the 'Great Sunday Squat' garnered much media attention and resulted five of the leaders being arrested for 'conspiring to incite and direct trespass.' The squatters left the apartments but did receive temporary accommodation. A sympathetic judge merely bound the squatters over to good behaviour.&lt;ref name="Webber, H. 2012 pp125-146"/&gt;

===1960s===
In the context of a severe housing crisis, the late 1960s saw the development of the Family Squatting Movement, which sought to mobilise people to take control of empty properties and use them to house homeless families from the [[Council house|Council Housing]] Waiting List. This movement was originally based in London (where Ron Bailey and [[Jim Radford]] were instrumental in helping to establish family squatting campaigns in several [[London borough]]s and later the Family Squatting Advisory Service), and several local Family Squatting Associations signed agreements with borough councils to use empty properties under licence (although only after some lengthy and bitter campaigns had been fought—most particularly in the borough of [[London Borough of Redbridge|Redbridge]]).&lt;ref name="Bailey, Ron 1973"&gt;Bailey, Ron ''The Squatters'' (1973) Penguin:UK {{ISBN|0140523006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey commented in 2005 that "The whole concept of community-based housing associations – that's where it all started, with squatting groups. It shows that the solution to housing problems isn't estate based, it should be based on mutual aid. The government should do all it can to enable self-help groups to flourish." &lt;ref&gt;Martin, D. 'A Squat of Their Own' in ''Inside Housing'' August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1967, the [[Principality of Sealand]] has existed as an unrecognised [[micronation]] on [[HM Fort Roughs]], a sea fort off the coast of Suffolk. It was occupied by [[Paddy Roy Bates]] who styled himself as His Royal Highness Prince Roy.

In 1969, members of the [[London Street Commune]] squatted a mansion at [[144 Piccadilly]] in central London to highlight the issue of homelessness but were quickly evicted.&lt;ref&gt;''Police storm squat in Piccadilly'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/21/newsid_3092000/3092343.stm News On This Day] 21 September 1969&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eel Pie Island]] Hotel was occupied by a small group of local anarchists including illustrator [[Clifford Harper]]. By 1970 it had become the UK's largest [[hippy]] [[commune]].&lt;ref name='Faiers'&gt;{{cite book | last = Faiers | first = Chris | title = Eel Pie Dharma | publisher=Unfinished Monument Press | year = 1990 | url = | id = | isbn = 0-920976-42-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s onwards===

[[File:StAgnesPl.squats.JPG|thumb|St Agnes Place pre-demolition]]

By the early 1970s, there was a growing conflict between the original activists of the Family Squatting Movement and a newer wave of squatters who simply rejected the right of landlords to charge rent and who believed (or claimed to) that seizing property and living rent-free was a revolutionary political act or more practically decided it was a good way to save money. These new-wave squatters (often young and single rather than homeless families) were a mixture of anarchists, [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]—the [[International Marxist Group]] (IMG) being especially prominent—and self-proclaimed [[hippie]] [[Dropping out|dropouts]], and they denounced the idea that squatters should seek to make agreements with local Councils to use empty property and that Squatting Associations should then become landlords (or Self Help Housing Associations as they were sometimes styled) in their own right and charge [[Renting|rent]].

The [[Advisory Service for Squatters]] (ASS) continued the work of the Family Squatting Advisory Service, running a volunteer service helping squatters. ASS has been in continuous existence for almost forty years. It publishes the ''Squatters' Handbook'' and has drafted a legal warning to be used by squatters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://squatter.org.uk/ Advisory Service for Squatters]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St Agnes Place]] was a squatted street in Kennington, South London, which was occupied from 1969 until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4481284.stm 'Oldest squat' residents evicted ]&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC documentary series [[Lefties]] profiled a squatted street called Villa Road in Brixton, which is still in existence.

Local Authority Housing Departments, facing rising court costs when evicting squatters, often resorted to taking out the plumbing and toilets in empty buildings to deter squatters. In the 1970s, some housing councils would attempt to deter squatters from entering their properties by "gutting" the houses, rendering them uninhabitable by pouring concrete into toilets and sinks or smashing the ceilings and staircases.&lt;ref name="Bailey, Ron 1973"/&gt;

Activists such as Terry Fitzpatrick teamed up with the local community in Whitechapel to form the Bengali Housing Action Group (BHAG) in 1976. At a time when the National Front was a threat in the area, Bengali families found strength squatting in numbers. Members of [[Race Today]] were involved in BHAG. When the [[Greater London Council]] declared an amnesty for squatters in 1977, they offered the Bengali families estates in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, S. [http://www.sarahglynn.net/The%20Battle%20for%20Housing.html 'East End Immigrants and the Battle for Housing: A comparative study of political mobilisation in the Jewish and Bengali communities'] in ''Journal of Historical Geography'' 31 pp 528-545 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, there were estimated to be 50,000 squatters throughout Britain, with the majority (30,000) living in [[London]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;Kearns, K (1979) ''Intraurban Squatting in London'', Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol. 69, No. 4 (December 1979), pp. 589-598&lt;/ref&gt; There was a London's Squatters' Union in which [[Piers Corbyn]] was involved. For eighteen months, it was housed at Huntley Street, where over 150 people lived in 52 flats. The union organised festivals and provided homes for the homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Etoe, C ''Empty again, the squat attacked by bulldozers'' Camden New Journal 21 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Squatters occupied the [[Centre Point]] building in central London to protest homelessness and set up a free state in west London called [[Frestonia]] which attempted to secede from England. 
Actor [[David Rappaport]] was the Foreign Minister, while playwright [[Heathcote Williams]] served as Ambassador to Great Britain. The squatters later formed themselves into a [[housing co-operative]] which still owns the buildings. In Euston, Tolmers Square was occupied by more than one hundred squatters, who engaged with local groups to fight for a redevelopment plan which fitted the community. "Demolitions and threats to Georgian Bloomsbury and to Tolmers Square in Euston (the 'locus classicus of London's intellectual squatting movement'), succeeded anew in drawing public attention to the plight of the squares, and precipitated the initial stirrings of the movement for their preservation." &lt;ref&gt;Longstaffe-Gowan, T. (2012) ''The London Square: Gardens in the Midst of Town'' New Haven: Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  The squatters lived there for six years, during which time Alara Wholefoods &amp; Community Foods started up. Community Foods grew to  become the largest wholefood company in Britain in the 1980's and 1990's.  Nick Wates writes that "It was only by taking direct action that anyone could intervene. By occupying empty buildings, squatters were able to halt the decline, revive the community and revive leadership in the struggle against the developers." &lt;ref&gt;Wates, N. (1976) ''The Battle for Tolmers Square'' Routledge: London.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Railton Road in Brixton, the 121 Centre was set up, having first been squatted by the black feminist [[Olive Morris]]. Until its eviction in 1999, the 121 hosted events and in the 1980s printed a squatters newspaper called Crowbar and the anarchist [[Black Flag (newspaper)|Black Flag]] magazine in its basement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Aufheben ''Kill or Chill - An analysis of the Opposition to the Criminal Justice Bill'' in Aufheben 4, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Centro Iberico]] was an old school squatted as a social centre in the 1980s, following on from the [[Wapping Autonomy Centre]].

Elsewhere in England, there were sizeable squatting communities in Brighton, Bristol, Cambridge,  Leicester and Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;Wates, N. &amp; Wolmar, C. (1983) ''Squatting the Real Story'' Bay Leaf:London.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bristol, in the mid-1980s, squatters had the Full Marx bookshop, the Demolition Ballroom and the Demolition Diner, all on Cheltenham Road.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the 1990s, squatters in Brighton formed a group called [[Justice?]] and squatted an old Courthouse. They later set up a Squatters Estate Agency which received national media coverage.
The 2012 [[Brighton Photo Biennial]] focused on 'Agents of Change' and released a full colour pamphlet entitled 'Another Space: Political Squatting in Brighton 1994 – present.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/photoworks_uk/docs/another_space_bpb12 Another Space]&lt;/ref&gt; Projects such as the aforementioned estate agency, a community garden, exhibitions and an anti-supermarket project were all featured. The curator commented that "While millionaires leave 'spare' houses empty for months on end and Tesco buy up land to be left vacant indefinitely, so called public space continues to diminish. By opening buildings to the public to make and share art, squatters create temporary autonomous spaces that radically refute this logic." &lt;ref&gt;Burbridge, B.

In 2003, it was estimated that there were 15,000 squatters in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Fallon A ''Squatters are back, and upwardly mobile'' in ''The Independent on Sunday'' 12 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Ministry of Justice deemed the figure to be 20,000.&lt;ref name="consultationamendment"&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/consultations/dealing-with-squatters.htm 'Options for dealing with squatters']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to statistics compiled by the [[Empty Homes Agency]] in 2009, the most empty homes in the UK were in [[Birmingham]] (21,532), [[Leeds]] (24,796) [[Liverpool]] (20,860) and [[Manchester]] (24,955).&lt;ref&gt;Empty Homes Figures 2009 http://www.emptyhomes.com/usefulresources/stats/statistics.html&lt;/ref&gt; The fewest empty homes were in [[South East England]] and [[East Anglia]].

In recent years, there have been squatted [[social centre]]s in many UK cities, linked through the [[UK Social Centre Network]]. The OKasional Cafe in Manchester began in 1998 and periodically created short-term autonomous spaces including cafes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radicalmanchester.wordpress.com/2009/12/20/okasional-cafes/ Okasional Cafes]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[RampART Social Centre]] in Whitechapel, London, existed from May 2004 until October 2009, hosting meetings, screenings, performances, exhibitions and benefit gigs.

Groups have also squatted land as community gardens. Two such London projects were the [[Kew Bridge Ecovillage]] and the [[Hounslow community land project]]. In Reading, a garden called Common Ground was opened in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afed.org.uk/org/issue69/common_ground_post_eviction.html 'Creating Common Ground: A squatted community garden as a strategy for anti-capitalists'] in Organise issue 69&lt;/ref&gt; It was then resquatted the following year as part of the April2008 days of action in support of autonomous spaces.

[[File:Gremlins.jpg|thumb|''Gremlins'' protesting on the roof of the squatted Spin Bowling, Cardiff, 2012.]]

As a result of the criminalisation of squatting in residential buildings, a group calling themselves ''The Gremlins'' in October 2012 resisted eviction of Spin Bowling in Cardiff from bailiffs and police. The group covered their faces with scarves and masks, posting on ''Bristol [[Indymedia]]'' claiming; ''"The state tries to make people homeless, anarchists have no sympathy for the state and its lackeys."''

In November 2012, masked squatters moved into the Bute Dock Hotel in [[Cardiff Bay]], owned by the nearby [[letting agent]]s Keylet. They were seen on the roof and were believed to be from the group, after a post on the Gremlin Alley [[Twitter]] account. Managing Director and Chairman of the Association of Letting and Management Agents, Mr Vidler, said ''"It's distressing because I have items in there which are part of our business"'', concerned it would cost a lot of money to remove them.&lt;ref name="butedock"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://yourcardiff.walesonline.co.uk/2012/11/21/masked-squatters-move-into-bute-dock-hotel/ | work=Wales Online | title=Masked squatters move into Bute Dock Hotel | date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week they had left, after the owners took legal action, as it was being used for storage.

==Legality==
[[File:Vacant property for squatters.jpg|thumb|right|A property in [[Oxford]] owned by [[University College, Oxford|University College]] which has been occupied by squatters.]]

===Common law===
{{main|Adverse possession}}
Historically, there is a [[common law]] right (known as "adverse possession") to claim ownership of a dwelling after continual unopposed occupation of land or property for a given period of several years or more, depending on the laws to a particular jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Adverse possession is defined as, "An open, notorious, exclusive and adverse possession for twenty years operates to convey a complete title...not only an interest in the land...but complete dominion over it." [[Sir William Blackstone]] (1759), Commentaries on the Laws of England, Volume 2, page 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

UK laws allow for adverse possession claims range after 10 to 12 years, depending on if the land is [[Land registration#United Kingdom|unregistered]]. In practice, adverse possession can be difficult. For example, [[St Agnes Place]] in [[London]] had been occupied for 30 years until 29 November 2005, when [[Lambeth London Borough Council]] evicted the entire street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4481284.stm 'Oldest squat' residents evicted]&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of adverse possession was fundamentally altered following the passing of the [[Land Registration Act 2002]]. In effect, after 10 years of actual physical possession, a squatter may apply to the [[HM Land Registry|Land Registry]] to have their title recognised as the owner in [[fee simple]]. However the original titled owner of the property, who will be notified by the Land Registry of the change in ownership, has the right to defeat the application by way of objection.

===Criminal Law Act 1977===
Section 6 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]] covers the occupation of property. The Act was implemented to stop [[slum landlord]]s forcibly evicting tenants (as was the case with the notorious London landlord [[Peter Rachman]] in the 1950s-1960s), and made "violence for securing entry" an offence. The law states:
:if "(a) there is someone present on those premises at the time who is opposed to the entry which the violence is intended to secure; and (b) the person using or threatening the violence knows that that is the case."&lt;ref name="Criminal Law Act 1977"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/45/section/12 Criminal Law Act 1977]&lt;/ref&gt; The law does not distinguish for this purpose between violence to persons or property (e.g. breaking a door down).

People who squatted in buildings would often put up a "Section 6" legal notice on the front door.&lt;ref&gt;The Section 6 Legal Warning&lt;/ref&gt; The notice stated there were people living in the property who claimed they had a legal right to be there. It warned anyone — even the actual owner of the property — who tried to enter the building without lawful permission that they would be committing an offence.

In September 2012, the law was changed making [[trespass]] in a residential building with the intention of permanently residing a criminal offence. Although a Section 6 warning still applies for non-residential buildings.

===Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994===

The [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] introduced section 6.1(A) and other provisions were added, which override this and give the right of entry to "displaced residential occupiers", "protected intending occupiers" (someone who had intended to occupy the property, including some tenants, [[licensee]]s and [[landlord]]s who require the property for use), or someone acting on their behalf. These terms are defined in sections 12 and 12A. Such people may legally enter an occupied property even using force as the usual section 6 provision does not apply to them, and may require "any person who is on [their] premises as a trespasser" to leave. Failure to leave is a criminal offence under section 7 and removal may be enforced by police.

===Civil Procedure Rules===

In 2001, the [[Civil Procedure Rules]] introduced new processes for civil repossession of property and related processes, under section 55. These include a fast track process whereby the legally rightful occupier can obtain an interim possession order (IPO) in a civil court which will enable them to enter the premises at will.  Any unlawful occupiers who refuse to leave after the granting of an IPO is committing a criminal offence&lt;ref name="Criminal Law Act 1977"/&gt; and can then be removed by police. However some of these processes may not be available unless used within 28 days of the time that the claimant knew of the unauthorised occupancy.

Criminal law refers to an "occupier"&lt;ref name="crimlaw1977" /&gt; or "trespasser",&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law Act 1977 section 12, and especially 12(3) and 12(6)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Civil Procedure Rules part 55 refer to possession claims against "trespassers".

Kenneth Clarke then announced an amendment to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill which would criminalise squatting in residential buildings.&lt;ref name=legalaidbill&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/bills-and-acts/bills/legal-aid-and-sentencing-bill.htm 'Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Clarke stated "There are no valid arguments in defence of squatting. It represents the seizure of another's property without consent."&lt;ref&gt;Hansard [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/oct/15/squatting HC Deb 15 October 1991 vol 196 cc151-65]&lt;/ref&gt; John McDonnell commented that "by trying to sneak this amendment through the back door the government are attempting to bypass democracy."&lt;ref name=squash2&gt;[http://www.squashcampaign.org/2011/10/government-bypasses-democracy-to-sneak-through-anti-squatting-laws/ 'Government ‘bypasses democracy’ to sneak through anti-squatting laws']&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment states that "the new offence will be committed where a person is in a residential building as a trespasser having entered it as a trespasser, knows or ought to know that he or she is a trespasser and is living in the building or intends to live there for any period."&lt;ref name="consultationamendment"/&gt;

The change in legislation has been referred to by Mike Weatherley as "Weatherley's Law" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mikeweatherleymp.com/2012/04/12/%E2%80%9Cweatherley%E2%80%99s-law%E2%80%9D-soon-to-become-reality/&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force on 1 September 2012, making squatting in a residential building a criminal offence subject to arrest, fine and imprisonment.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19429936 | work=BBC News | title=Squatting set to become a criminal offence | date=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since criminalisation==

In September 2012, Alex Haigh was the first squatter imprisoned under the new law, receiving a sentence of 3 months after occupying a housing association property in London.&lt;ref name="alex"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/27/first-squatter-jailed-new-law | title=First squatter jailed under new law | publisher=The Guardian | date=27 September 2012 | location=London | first=Owen | last=Bowcott}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two men were then found guilty of squatting above the Lamb Inn, in [[Romford]].&lt;ref name="romford"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.london24.com/news/court/pair_found_guilty_of_squatting_above_historic_lamb_inn_in_romford_1_1692923 | title=Pair found guilty of squatting above historic Lamb Inn in Romford | publisher=London24 | date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Conservative MPs called for the criminalisation of squatting in commercial buildings as well, due to the perceived increase in the squatting of business properties. These included the following pubs: the Cross Keys in Chelsea, the Tournament in Earls Court (both in London) and the Upper Bell Inn near Chatham, Kent.&lt;ref name="tories"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/nov/30/criminalise-squatting-commercial-property | title=Criminalise squatting in commercial premises, say Tory MPs | publisher=The Guardian | date=30 November 2012 | location=London | first=Owen | last=Bowcott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, a homeless man named Daniel Gauntlett froze to death on the doorstep of an abandoned bungalow, in a case that has been linked with the new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In November 2013, a squatter convicted under section 144 had his appeal upheld at Hove Crown Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10778820.Celebrations_at_Hove_squat_trial_failure/ | title = Celebrations at Hove squat trial failure | first = Neil

Two other squatters were also arrested and had previously had the charges against them dropped completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10375093.Two_Brighton_squat_cases_rejected_in_court/ | title = Two Brighton squat cases rejected in court | date = 24 April 2013 | newspaper = [[Brighton Argus]] | accessdate = 7 November 2013 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newsletter from SQUASH published in May 2016 states that there have been "at least 738 arrests, 326 prosecutions, 260 convictions and 11 people imprisoned for the offence, based on available information" since criminalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.squashcampaign.org/repeal-law/report-squatting-statistics-2015/ | title = Squatting Statistics 2015 – version 2.0 | date = May 2016 | publisher = SQUASH | accessdate = 7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Still Life: Balsam Apple and Vegetables''''' is an early 19th century [[oil painting]] by American painter [[James Peale]]. Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a number of vegetables set on a table. The work is currently on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].
== Description ==
The painting is a [[still life]], created to allow for an accurate representation of a physical object on a painted canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wga.hu/html_m/p/peale/stillife.html|title=Still Life: Balsam Apples and Vegetables by PEALE, James|website=www.wga.hu|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's description of the work, the painting is possibly an "experimental exercise" created during the peak of Peale's career.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11734?sortBy=Relevance&amp;amp;high=on&amp;amp;od=on&amp;amp;ft=*&amp;amp;offset=160&amp;amp;rpp=100&amp;amp;pos=211|title=www.metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is noted as being similar to the Spanish School of still life painting due to its focus on vegetables.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Symphony No. 1 in D major ''An das Vaterland'' (''To the Fatherland'')''', Op. 96, was composed by [[Joachim Raff]] between 1859 and 1861.

== History ==

The work was Raff's first numbered symphony, though not the first symphony he had written. He composed a Grand Symphony in  E minor, WoO. 18, in 1854, but only two of the work's original five movements survive.

Raff entered the completed symphony in a competition organized in Vienna, sponsored by Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde and judged by [[Ferdinand Hiller]], [[Carl Reinecke]], [[Robert Volkmann]] and [[Vinzenz Lachner]]. It won first prize out of 32 entries.&lt;ref name="Avrohom"&gt;[http://www.raff.org/support/download/sym01_en.htm Symphony No. 1, op.96 An das Vaterland (1859-61)], Avrohom Leichtling, 2007, retrieved 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony was premiered in February 1863 in Vienna at the [[Musikverein]], conducted by [[Joseph Hellmesberger, Sr.]]&lt;ref name="Avrohom" /&gt; It is dedicated to [[Charles Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] and was published in 1864 in Leipzig by J. Schuberth &amp; Co. The duration is between 60&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/Name/Samuel-Friedman/Conductor/57593-3 Raff: Symphony No 1 / SamuelFriedman, Rhenish Po] arkivmusic.com&lt;/ref&gt; and 70 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2011/Jan11/Raff_TudorCD1600.htm Joseph Joachim RAFF (1822-1882) / The Symphonies] musicweb-international.com 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scoring and structure ==

The symphony is scored for 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s in A, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[french horn|horns]] in F, 2 [[trumpet]]s in F, 2 [[trombone]]s, [[bass trombone]], [[timpani]] and [[string instrument|strings]].

The symphony is structured in five movements:

# ''Allegro''
# ''Scherzo. Allegro molto vivace'' ([[D minor]])
# ''Larghetto'' ([[B-flat major]])
# ''Allegro dramatico'' ([[G minor]])
# ''Larghetto sostenuto'' (D minor)

Raff uses extensively a melody composed in 1825 by [[Gustav Reichardt]] for [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]]'s poem ''[[Des Deutschen Vaterland|Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?]]''.&lt;ref name="Avrohom" /&gt;

According to Helen Raff's biography of her father, "The first three movements are supposed to show German life and existence, the fourth describes German disunity." She further adds: "The fifth movement begins with a lament on the destiny of greater Germany and then proceeds to develop prophetic visions of future unity and majesty." Joachim Raff's note about the symphony states "Here the composer felt himself permitted the use of a motive not original with him ... as a symbol."&lt;ref name="Avrohom" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7015">[[File:Avery Fisher Hall.jpg|thumb|Philharmonic Hall (today Avery Fisher Hall), Lincoln Center, where Chávez's Sixth Symphony was premiered in 1964]]
'''Symphony No. 6''' is an orchestral work by [[Carlos Chávez]], composed in 1961–62.

==History==
The Sixth Symphony was commissioned by the [[New York Philharmonic]] in celebration of their 1962–63 opening season in [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]]. Composition was completed in 1962 and a date was scheduled for the symphony's premiere in the spring of 1963, but Chávez continued revisions to the score and the date had to be postponed. It was finally premiered in New York on 7 May 1964 in Philharmonic Hall, Lincoln Center, by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and the New York Philharmonic, to whom the score is dedicated ({{harvnb|Klein|1964}}; {{harvnb|Orbón|1987c|loc=80}}).

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, two trumpets, two trombones, bass trombone, tuba, timpani, percussion (two players), and strings.

==Analysis==
The work is in three movements:
#Allegro energico
#Adagio molto cantabile
#Con anima

Far from the experimental approaches Chávez  adopted in his earlier symphonies, the Sixth accepts the classical forms. The first movement is a [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]], beginning with a C-major theme recalling the symphonic style of the Romantic era. A bitonal transition leads to the second theme, in the dominant key of G. After extensive development, the recapitulation is followed by a developmental coda, including a strict mirror canon on the first theme. The movement fades to nothing in a constant march in [[Tuplet (music)|triplets]] {{harv|Orbón|1987c|loc=75–77}}.

The second movement functions as a short but intense interlude between the outer movements. It falls into two sections, the first beginning in the brass and woodwinds, finally giving way to the violins. This is followed, after a descending transitional passage in the low brass, by the second section, where the double basses present the theme that will form the basis of the finale. There is a suggestion of the contrapuntal atmosphere, and even an anticipation of the two counterthemes of the first variation of the following movement {{harv|Orbón|1987c|loc=77}}.

The symphony closes with a magisterial [[passacaglia]]. After the announcement of the bass ostinato in the tuba, there follow thirty-four variations, a [[fugue]] with two expositions, and then a further seven variations to conclude. The twenty-ninth variation evokes a [[Johannes Brahms|Brahmsian]] sound as a culmination, reflecting the illustrious antecedent Chávez has accepted as his model, and the main theme from the first movement returns in the thirtieth. The last statement of the bass theme brings the movement to an imposing close in C major {{harv|Orbón|1987c|loc=77–78}}.

[[File:Textbook.JPG|thumb|Textbook]]
A '''textbook''' or '''coursebook''' ([[British English|UK English]]) is a manual of instruction in any branch of study. Textbooks are produced according to the demands of educational institutions. '''Schoolbooks''' are textbooks and other books used in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|schoolbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/schoolbook|title=schoolbook - definition of schoolbook in English from the Oxford dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818041404/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/schoolbook|archivedate=18 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, most textbooks aren't published exclusively in printed format; many are now available as online [[e-book|electronic books]].

==History==
The history of textbooks dates back to civilizations of ancient history. For example, [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] wrote ''texts'' intended for education. The modern textbook has its roots in the standardization made possible by the printing press. [[Johannes Gutenberg]] himself may have printed editions of Ars Minor, a schoolbook on Latin grammar by [[Aelius Donatus]]. Early textbooks were used by tutors and teachers, who used the books as instructional aids (e.g., alphabet books), as well as individuals who taught themselves.

The Greek philosopher [[Plato]] lamented the loss of knowledge because the media of transmission were changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130020156/http://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ |archivedate=2013-01-30 |df= }} True Stuff: Socrates vs. the Written Word, January 27th, 2011. By David Malki&lt;/ref&gt; Before the invention of the [[Greek alphabet]] 2,500 years ago, knowledge and stories were recited aloud, much like [[Homer]]'s epic poems. The new technology of writing meant stories no longer needed to be memorized, a development Socrates feared would weaken the Greeks' mental capacities for memorizing and retelling. (Ironically, we know about Socrates' concerns only because they were written down by his student [[Plato]] in his famous Dialogues.) &lt;ref&gt;Marcia Clemmitt, "Learning Online Literacy," in "Reading Crisis?" CQ Researcher, Feb. 22, 2008, pp. 169-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next revolution for books came with the 15th-century invention of printing with changeable type. The invention is attributed to German metalsmith [[Johannes Gutenberg]], who cast type in molds using a melted metal alloy and constructed a wooden-screw [[printing press]] to transfer the image onto paper.

Gutenberg's first and only large-scale printing effort was the now iconic [[Gutenberg Bible]] in the 1450s — a Latin translation from the Hebrew Old Testament and the [[Greek New Testament]], copies of which can be viewed on the British Library website. Gutenberg's invention made mass production of texts possible for the first time. Although the Gutenberg Bible itself was expensive, printed books began to spread widely over European trade routes during the next 50 years, and by the 16th century, printed books had become more widely accessible and less costly.&lt;ref&gt;British Library, "Treasures in Full: Gutenberg Bible," http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/background.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compulsory education]] and the subsequent growth of schooling in Europe led to the printing of many standardized texts for children. Textbooks have become the primary teaching instrument for most children since the 19th century. Two textbooks of historical significance in United States schooling were the 18th century [[New England Primer]] and the 19th century [[McGuffey Readers]].

Technological advances change the way people interact with textbooks. Online and digital materials are making it increasingly easy for students to access materials other than the traditional print textbook. Students now have access to electronic and PDF books, online tutoring systems and video lectures. An example of an electronically published book, or e-book, is ''[[Principles of Biology]]'' from [[Nature Publishing Group|Nature Publishing]].

Most notably, an increasing number of authors are foregoing commercial publishers and offering their textbooks under a [[creative commons]] or other open license.

==Market==

===The "broken market"===
The textbook market does not operate in the same manner as most consumer markets.  First, the end consumers (students) do not select the product, and the people (faculty and professors) who do select the product do not purchase it.  Therefore, price is removed from the purchasing decision, giving the producer (publishers) disproportionate market power to set prices high.  However, some{{who|date=November 2017}} argue that textbooks are really part of another product; the class that the student registered to take.  But the price of the textbook still isn't typically taken into account when this occurs and isn't part of the perception of the product.  

This fundamental difference in the market is often cited as the primary reason that prices are high.  The term "broken market" first appeared in the economist James Koch's analysis of the market commissioned by the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, James P. [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED497025&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED497025 "An Economic Analysis of Textbook Prices and the Textbook Market"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622145100/http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED497025&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED497025 |date=2012-06-22 }}, 2006-09. Retrieved on 2012-06-12. ([http://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/CBICBT99/FIN_AID/US_ED/A060923K.pdf Alternative location (PDF)])&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation is exacerbated by the lack of competition in the textbook market.  [[Consolidation (business)|Consolidation]] in the past few decades{{when|date=December 2011}} has reduced the number of major textbook companies from around 30 to just a handful.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Marla Matzer. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110523050151/http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/08/05/20070805-D1-01.html City at the head of the class: Consolidation, talent pool have made Columbus a hotbed for educational publishers.] August 5, 2007. Retrieved 2/14/09. Archived from [http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/08/05/20070805-D1-01.html the original] on 23 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, there is less competition than there used to be, and the high cost of starting up keeps new companies from entering.

===New editions and the used book market===
Students seek relief from rising prices through the purchase of [[resale|used copies]] of textbooks, which tend to be less expensive.  Most college bookstores offer used copies of textbooks at lower prices.  Most bookstores will also buy used copies back from students at the end of a term if the book is going to be re-used at the school.  Books that are not being re-used at the school are often purchased by an off-campus wholesaler for 0-30% of the new cost, for distribution to other bookstores where the books will be sold.  Textbook companies have countered this by encouraging faculty to assign homework that must be done on the publisher's website.  If a student has a new textbook, then he or she can use the pass code in the book to register on the site.  If the student has purchased a used textbook, then he or she must pay money directly to the publisher in order to access the website and complete assigned homework.

Students who look beyond the campus bookstore can typically find lower prices.  With the ISBN or title, author and edition, most textbooks can be located through online used book sellers or retailers.

Most leading textbook companies publish a new edition every 3 or 4 years, more frequently in math &amp; science.  Harvard economics chair James K. Stock has stated that new editions are often not about significant improvements to the content. "New editions are to a considerable extent simply another tool used by publishers and textbook authors to maintain their revenue stream, that is, to keep up prices," &lt;ref&gt;But, in fact, no revenue from used book sales flows either to the publisher or to the author of the work.  New editions serve to keep revenues flowing to publishers and authors, but do not affect prices paid for used older editions.

"[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=522288 Professors Find Different Uses for Textbook Profits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517084733/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=522288 |date=2008-05-17 }}." ''The Harvard Crimson,'' 4 March 2008. Retrieved on 7 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by The Student [[Public Interest Research Group|PIRGs]] found that a new edition costs 12% more than a new copy of previous edition, and 58% more than a used copy of the previous edition. Textbook publishers maintain these new editions are driven by faculty demand.  The Student PIRGs' study found that 76% of faculty said new editions were justified “half of the time or less” and 40% said they were justified “rarely” or “never.”&lt;ref name="ripoff-101"&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101 Rip-off 101: How the Current Practices of the Textbook Industry Drive Up the Cost of College Textbooks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322211618/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101 |date=2010-03-22 }} The Student PIRGs (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The PIRG study has been criticized by publishers, who argue that the report contains factual inaccuracies regarding the annual average cost of textbooks per student.&lt;ref&gt;Capriccioso, Rob.

''Inside Higher Ed'', August 29, 2006. Retrieved 2/14/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Student PIRGs also point out that recent emphasis on electronic textbooks, or "eTextbooks," does not always save students money.  Even though the book costs less up-front, the student will not recover any of the cost through resale.&lt;ref name="course-correction"&gt;Allen, Nicole. [http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/course-correction Course Correction: How Digital Textbooks Are Off Track and How to Set Them Straight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322211602/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/course-correction |date=2010-03-22 }}. The Student PIRGs (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bundling===
Another publishing industry practice that has been highly criticized is "bundling," or shrink-wrapping supplemental items into a textbook. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  Supplemental items range from CD-ROMs and workbooks to online passcodes and bonus material.  Students do not always have the option to purchase these items separately, and often the one-time-use supplements destroy the resale value of the textbook.&lt;ref name="required-reading"&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/required-reading Required Reading: A Look at the Words Publishing Tactics at Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064817/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/required-reading |date=2010-03-14 }}, The Student PIRGs (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Student PIRGs, the typical bundled textbook is 10%-50% more than an unbundled textbook, and 65% of professors said they “rarely” or “never” use the bundled items in their courses.&lt;ref name="ripoff-101"/&gt;

A 2005 [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) Report found that the production of these supplemental items was the primary cause of rapidly increasing prices:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
While publishers, retailers, and wholesalers all play a role in textbook pricing, the primary factor contributing to increases in the price of textbooks has been the increased investment publishers have made in new products to enhance instruction and learning...While wholesalers, retailers, and others do not question the quality of these materials, they have expressed concern that the publishers’ practice 
of packaging supplements with a textbook to sell as one unit limits the opportunity students have to purchase less expensive used books....If publishers continue to increase these investments, particularly in technology, the cost to produce a textbook is likely to continue to increase in the future.&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;"[http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/abstract.php?rptno=GAO-05-806 College Textbooks: Enhanced Offerings Appear to Drive Recent Price Increases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619071824/http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/abstract.php?rptno=GAO-05-806 |date=2008-06-19 }}." U.S. Government Accountability Office, Washington, DC, 2005. Abstract. Retrieved 7 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bundling has also been used as a means of segmenting the used book market.  Each combination of a textbook and supplemental items receives a separate ISBN.  A single textbook could therefore have dozens of ISBNs that denote different combinations of supplements packaged with that particular book.  When a bookstore attempts to track down used copies of textbooks, they will search for the ISBN the course instructor orders, which will locate only a subset of the copies of the textbook.

Legislation on the state and federal level seeks to limit the practice of bundling, by requiring publishers to offer all components separately.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/campaign/hr4137 Analysis of Textbook Affordability Provisions in H.R. 4137] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124161237/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/campaign/hr4137 |date=2009-11-24 }}, The Student PIRGs&lt;/ref&gt;  Publishers have testified in favor of bills including this provision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2008A/commsumm.nsf/58e6d054c29cbe1287256e5f00670a70/78f66284de2d10b28725740400734883?OpenDocument|title=House Committee on Education (03/06/2008)|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413042944/http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2008A/commsumm.nsf/58e6d054c29cbe1287256e5f00670a70/78f66284de2d10b28725740400734883?OpenDocument|archivedate=13 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but only in the case that the provision exempts the loosely defined category of "integrated textbooks."

===Price disclosure===
Given that the problem of high textbook prices is linked to the "broken" economics of the market, requiring publishers to disclose textbook prices to faculty is a solution pursued by a number of legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/04/13/textbooks|title=Textbook Battle's New Frontier|author=Elia Powers|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821104447/https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/04/13/textbooks|archivedate=21 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By inserting price into sales interactions, this regulation will supposedly make the economic forces operate more normally.

No data suggests that this is in fact true.  However, The Student PIRGs have found that publishers actively withhold pricing information from faculty, making it difficult to obtain.  Their most recent study found that 77% of faculty say publisher sales representatives do not volunteer prices, and only 40% got an answer when they directly asked.  Furthermore, the study found that 23% of faculty rated publisher websites as “informative and easy to use” and less than half said they typically listed the price.&lt;ref&gt;Zomer, Saffron.

===Used textbook market===
Once a textbook is purchased from a retailer for the first time, there are several ways a student can sell his/her textbooks back at the end of the semester or later. Students can sell to 1) the college/university bookstore; 2) fellow students; 3) a number of online websites; or 4) a student swap service.

====Campus buyback====
As for buyback on a specific campus, faculty decisions largely determine how much a student receives. If a professor chooses to use the same book the following semester, even if it is a custom text, designed specifically for an individual instructor, bookstores often buy the book back. The GAO report found that, generally, if a book is in good condition and will be used on the campus again the next term, bookstores will pay students 50 percent of the original price paid. If the bookstore has not received a faculty order for the book at the end of the term and the edition is still current, they may offer students the wholesale price of the book, which could range from 5 to 35 percent of the new retail price, according to the GAO report.&lt;ref name=GAO/&gt;

When students resell their textbooks during campus “buyback” periods, these textbooks are often sold into the national used textbook distribution chain.  If a textbook is not going to be used on campus for the next semester of courses then many times the college bookstore will sell that book to a national used book company.  The used book company then resells the book to another college bookstore.  Finally, that book is sold as used to a student at another college at a price that is typically 75% of the new book price. At each step, a markup is applied to the book to enable the respective companies to continue to operate.

====Student to student sales====
Students can also sell or trade textbooks among themselves. After completing a course, sellers will often seek out members of the next enrolling class, people who are likely to be interested in purchasing the required books. This may be done by posting flyers to advertise the sale of the books or simply soliciting individuals who are shopping in the college bookstore for the same titles. Many larger schools have independent websites set up for the purpose of facilitating such trade. These often operate much like digital classified ads, enabling students to list their items for sale and browse for those they wish to acquire. Also, at the [[US Air Force Academy]], it is possible to [[e-mail]] entire specific classes, allowing for an extensive network of textbook sales to exist.

====Student online marketplaces====
Online marketplaces are one of the two major types of online websites students can use to sell used textbooks. Online marketplaces may have an [[Online auction business model|online auction]] format or may allow the student to list their books for a fixed price. In either case, the student must create the listing for each book themselves and wait for a buyer to order, making the use of marketplaces a more passive way of selling used textbooks. Unlike campus buyback and online book, students are unlikely to sell all their books to one buyer using online marketplaces, and will likely have to send out multiple books individually.

====Online book buyers====
Online book buyers buy textbooks, and sometimes other types of books, with the aim of reselling them for a profit. Like online marketplaces, online book buyers operate year-round, giving students the opportunity to sell their books even when campus "buyback" periods are not in effect. Students enter the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] numbers of the books they wish to sell and receive a price quote or offer. These online book buyers often offer "free shipping" (which in actuality is built into the offer for the book), and allow students to sell multiple books to the same source. Because online book buyers are buying books for resale, the prices they offer may be lower than students can get on online marketplaces. However, their prices are competitive, and they tend to focus on the convenience of their service. Some even claim that buying used textbooks online and selling them to online book buyers has a lower total cost than even textbook rental services.

====Textbook exchanges====
In response to escalating textbook prices, limited competition, and to provide a more efficient system to connect buyers and sellers together, online textbook exchanges were developed. Most of today's sites handle buyer and seller payments, and usually deduct a small commission only after the sale is completed.

According to textbook author [[Henry L. Roediger III|Henry L. Roediger]] (and Wadsworth Publishing Company senior editor Vicki Knight), the used textbook market is illegitimate, and entirely to blame for the rising costs of textbooks.  As methods of "dealing with this problem", he recommends making previous editions of textbooks obsolete, binding the textbook with other materials, and passing laws to prevent the sale of used books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/why-are-textbooks-so-expensive|magazine=Observer|publisher=Association for Psychological Science|title=Why Are Textbooks So Expensive?|author=Henry L. Roediger, III|date=January 2005|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317041203/https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/why-are-textbooks-so-expensive|archivedate=17 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is not unlike the limited licensing approach for computer software, which places rigid restrictions on resale and reproduction.  The intent is to make users understand that the content of any textbook is the intellectual property of the author and/or the publisher, and that as such, subject to copyright. Obviously, this idea is completely opposed to the millennia-old tradition of the sale of [[used book]]s, and would make that entire industry illegal.

==== E-textbooks ====
Another alternative to save money and obtaining the materials you are required are e-textbooks.The article "E books rewrite the rules of education" states that, alternately to spending a lot of money on textbooks, you can purchase an e-textbook at a small amount of the cost. With the growth of digital applications for iPhone, and gadgets like the Amazon kindle, e-textbooks are not an innovation, but have been "gaining momentum".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ebooks Rewrite the Rules of Education|url = http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Ebooks-Rewrite-the--Rules-of-Education-53676.htm|website = EContent Magazine|last = Mullan|first = Eileen|date = 4 May 2009|access-date = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180317231848/http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Ebooks-Rewrite-the--Rules-of-Education-53676.htm|archivedate = 17 March 2018|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the article " Are textbooks obsolete?", publishers and editorials are concerned about the issue of expensive textbooks. "The expense of textbooks is a concern for students, and e-textbooks, address the face of the issue, Williams says " As publishers we understand the high cost of these materials, and the electronic format  permit us diminish the general expense of our content to the market".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Are textbooks obsolete?

=== Rental programs ===
In-store rentals are processed by either using a kiosk and ordering books online with a third party facilitator or renting directly from the store's inventory. Some stores use a hybrid of both methods, opting for in-store selections of the most popular books and the online option for more obscure titles or books they consider too risky to put in the rental system.

=== Textbook sharing ===
Another method to help students save money that is coming up is called Textbooks Sharing. Using textbook sharing the students share the physical textbook with other students, and also the cost of the book is divided among the users of the textbook. So over the life of the textbook, if 4 students use the textbook, the cost of the textbook for each student will be 25% of the total cost of the book.

=== Open textbooks ===
{{main|Open textbook}}
The latest trend in textbooks is "open textbooks." An [[open textbook]] is a free, openly licensed textbook offered online by its author(s).  According to PIRG, a number of textbooks already exist, and are being used at schools such as MIT and Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;See PIRG's [http://www.studentpirgs.org/open-textbooks/catalog Catalog of Open Textbooks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324125700/http://www.studentpirgs.org/open-textbooks/catalog |date=2010-03-24 }} for examples of open textbooks&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study published found that open textbooks offer a viable and attractive means to meet faculty and student needs while offering savings of approximately 80% compared to traditional textbook options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/uploads/66/4d/664d09ba9bc97cc9138eda5faac5e061/A-Cover-To-Cover-Solution.pdf A Cover to Cover Solution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226015800/http://www.studentpirgs.org/uploads/66/4d/664d09ba9bc97cc9138eda5faac5e061/A-Cover-To-Cover-Solution.pdf |date=2010-12-26 }} by Nicole Allen of the Student PIRGs. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the largest question seems to be who is going to pay to write them, several state policies suggest that public investment in open textbooks might make sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_2251-2300/ab_2261_bill_20080221_introduced.html|title=AB 2261   Assembly Bill - INTRODUCED|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304135209/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_2251-2300/ab_2261_bill_20080221_introduced.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} To offer another perspective{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, any jurisdiction might find itself challenged to find sufficient numbers of credible academics who would be willing to undertake the effort of creating an open textbook without realistic compensation, in order to make such a proposal work.

The other challenge involves the reality of publishing, which is that textbooks with good sales and profitability subsidize the creation and publication of low demand but believed to be necessary textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Subsidies skew markets and the elimination of subsidies is disruptive; in the case of low demand textbooks the possibilities following subsidy removal include any or all of the following: higher retail prices, a switch to open textbooks, a reduction of the number of titles published.

On the other hand, independent open textbook authoring and publishing models are developing.  Most notably, the startup publisher [[Flat World Knowledge]] already has dozens of college-level open textbooks that are used by  more than 900 institutions in 44 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressitt.com/smnr/Flat-World-Knowledge-President-Eric-Frank-Addresses-Oregon-Legislators-on-Solving-Textbook-Affordability-/3569/ Flat World Knowledge President Eric Frank Addresses Oregon Legislators on Solving Textbook Affordability.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223233038/http://pressitt.com/smnr/Flat-World-Knowledge-President-Eric-Frank-Addresses-Oregon-Legislators-on-Solving-Textbook-Affordability-/3569/ |date=2011-02-23 }} Pressitt.

===International market pricing===

Similar to the issue of reimportation of [[pharmaceuticals]] into the U.S. market, the GAO report&lt;ref name=GAO/&gt; also highlights a similar phenomenon in textbook distribution. Retailers and publishers have expressed concern about the re-importation of lower-priced textbooks from international locations. Specifically, they cited the ability students have to purchase books from online distribution channels outside the United States at lower prices, which may result in a loss of sales for U.S. retailers. Additionally, the availability of lower-priced textbooks through these channels has heightened distrust and frustration among students regarding textbook prices, and college stores find it difficult to explain why their textbook prices are higher, according to the National Association of College Stores. Retailers and publishers have also been concerned that some U.S. retailers may have engaged in reimportation on a large scale by ordering textbooks for entire courses at lower prices from international distribution channels.  While the 1998 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision [[Quality King v. L'anza]] protects the reimportation of copyrighted materials under the [[first-sale doctrine]], textbook publishers have still attempted to prevent the U.S. sale of international editions by enforcing contracts which forbid foreign wholesalers from selling to American distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tamar |last=Lewin |title=Students Find $100 Textbooks Cost $50, Purchased Overseas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 October 2003 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916004116/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html |archivedate=16 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about the effects of differential pricing on college stores, the National Association of College Stores has called on publishers to stop the practice of selling textbooks at lower prices outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimony of Marc L. Fleischaker, Counsel, National Association of College Stores |url=http://republicans.edlabor.house.gov/archive/hearings/108th/21st/textbooks072004/fleischaker.htm |date=20 July 2004 |work=Hearing on "Are College Textbooks Priced Fairly?" |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Education and the Workforce, Subcommittee on 21st Century Competitiveness |accessdate=24 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806091310/http://republicans.edlabor.house.gov/archive/hearings/108th/21st/textbooks072004/fleischaker.htm |archivedate=6 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, some U.S. booksellers arrange for drop-shipments in foreign countries which are then re-shipped to America where the books can be sold online at used prices (for a "new" unopened book). The authors often getting half-royalties instead of full-royalties, minus the charges for returned books from bookstores.

===Production===

====Cost distribution====
According to the National Association of College Stores, the entire cost of the book is justified by expenses, with typically 11.7% of the price of a new book going to the author's royalties (or a committee of editors at the publishing house), 22.7% going to the store, and 64.6% going to the publisher.  The store and publisher amounts are slightly higher for Canada. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
Bookstores and used-book vendors profit from the resale of textbooks on the used market, with publishers only earning profits on sales of new textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

====Research====
According to the GAO study published July 2005:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Following closely behind annual increases in tuition and fees at postsecondary institutions, college textbook and supply prices have risen at twice the rate of annual inflation over the last two decades.

Rising at an average of 6 percent each year since academic year 1987-1988, compared with overall average price increases of 3 percent per year, college textbook and supply prices trailed tuition and fee increases, which averaged 7 percent per year. Since December 1986, textbook and supply prices have nearly tripled, increasing by 186 percent, while tuition and fees increased by 240 percent and overall prices grew by 72 percent. While increases in textbook and supply prices have followed increases in tuition and fees, the cost of textbooks and supplies for degree-seeking students as a percentage of tuition and fees varies by the type of institution attended. For example, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student for academic year 2003-2004 was $898 at 4-year public institutions, or about 26 percent of the cost of tuition and fees. At 2-year public institutions, where low-income students are more likely to pursue a degree program and tuition and fees are lower, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student was $886 in academic year 2003-2004, representing almost three-quarters of the cost of tuition and fees.&lt;ref name=GAO/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the 2nd edition of a study by the United States Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) published in February 2005{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}: ''"Textbook prices are increasing at more than four times the inflation rate for all finished goods, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index. The wholesale prices charged by textbook publishers have jumped 62 percent since 1994, while prices charged for all finished goods increased only 14 percent. Similarly, the prices charged by publishers for general books increased just 19 percent during the same time period."''

According to the 2007 edition of the College Board’s Trend in College Pricing Report published October 2007{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}: ''"College costs continue to rise and federal student aid has shown slower growth when adjusted for inflation, while textbooks, as a percentage of total college costs, have remained steady at about 5 percent."''

==K-12 textbooks==
In most U.S. [[K-12]] public schools, a local school board votes on which textbooks to purchase from a selection of books that have been approved by the state Department of Education. Teachers receive the books to give to the students for each subject. Teachers are usually not required to use textbooks, however, and many prefer to use other materials instead.

Textbook publishing in the U.S. is a business primarily aimed at large states. This is due to state purchasing controls over the books, most notably in Texas, where the [[Texas Education Agency]] sets curricula for all courses taught by the state's 1,000+ school districts, and therefore also approves which textbooks can be purchased.

===High school===
In recent years, high school textbooks of United States history have come under increasing criticism. Authors such as [[Howard Zinn]] (''[[A People's History of the United States]]''), [[Gilbert T. Sewall]] (''[[Textbooks: Where the Curriculum Meets the Child]]'') and [[James W. Loewen]] (''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong]]''), make the claim that [[History of the United States|U.S. history]] textbooks contain mythical untruths and omissions, which paint a whitewashed picture that bears little resemblance to what most students learn in universities. Inaccurately retelling history, through textbooks or other literature, has been practiced in many societies, from ancient [[Rome]] to the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) and the [[People's Republic of China]]. The content of history textbooks is often determined by the political forces of state adoption boards and ideological pressure groups.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Science textbooks have been the source of ongoing debates and have come under scrutiny from several organizations. The presentation or inclusion of controversial scientific material has been debated in several court cases. Poorly designed textbooks have been cited as contributing to declining grades in mathematics and science in the United States and organizations such as the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (AAAS) have criticized the layout, presentation, and amount of material given in textbooks.

Discussions of textbooks have been included on [[Creationism|creation]] and [[evolution]] in the public education debate. The ''[[Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County]]'' case brought forward a debate about scientific fact being presented in textbooks.

In his book, ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]'', the late physics [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Richard P. Feynman]] described his experiences as a member of a committee that evaluated science textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://textbooks.org/2012/09/book-review-surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/|title=Book Review: Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!|work=Textbooks.org - Compare Textbook Prices|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508135103/http://textbooks.org/2012/09/book-review-surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/|archivedate=8 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some instances, there were nonsensical examples to illustrate physical phenomena; then a company sent — for reasons of timing — a textbook that contained blank pages, which even got good critiques. Feynman himself experienced attempts at bribery.

== Mathematics ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
Largely in the US, but increasingly in other nations, K-12 Mathematics textbooks have reflected the controversies of [[new math]] and [[reform mathematics]] which have sought to replace [[traditional mathematics]] in what have been called the [[math wars]]. Traditional texts, still favored in Asia and other areas, merely taught the same time-tested mathematics that most adults have learned. By contrast "progressive" approaches seek to address problems in social inequity{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with approaches that often incorporate principles of [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivism]] and discovery. Texts such as [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space|TERC]] and [[Connected Mathematics|CMP]] discourage or omit standard mathematics methods and concepts such as long division and lowest common denominators. For example, an index entry to multiply fractions would lead to "devise your own method to multiply fractions which work on these examples", and the formula for the area of a circle would be an exercise for a student to derive rather than including it in the student text. By the 2000s, while some districts were still adopting the more novel methods, others had abandoned them as unworkable.

==Higher education==
In the U.S., college and university textbooks are chosen by the professor teaching the course, or by the department as a whole. Students are typically responsible for obtaining their own copies of the books used in their courses, although alternatives to owning textbooks, such as textbook rental services and library reserve copies of texts, are available in some instances.

In some European countries, such as Sweden or Spain, students attending institutions of higher education pay for textbooks themselves, although higher education is free of charge otherwise.

With higher education costs on the rise, many students are becoming sensitive to every aspect of college pricing, including textbooks, which in many cases amount to one tenth of tuition costs. The 2005 Government Accountability Office report on college textbooks said that since the 1980s, textbook and supply prices have risen twice the rate of inflation in the past two decades{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.  A 2005 PIRG study found that textbooks cost students $900 per year, and that prices &lt;ref name=GAO /&gt; increased four times the rate of inflation over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101-2nd-edition Rip-off 101: Second Edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064841/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101-2nd-edition |date=2010-03-14 }}, The Student PIRGs (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  A June 2007 Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) report, “Turn the Page,” reported that the average U.S. student spends $700–$1000 per year on textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/acsfa/edlite-txtbkstudy.html|title=Archived: Advisory Committee for Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) - U.S. Department of Education|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509204934/http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/acsfa/edlite-txtbkstudy.html|archivedate=9 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many groups have assigned blame to publishers, bookstores or faculty, the ACSFA also found that assigning blame to any one party—faculty, colleges, bookstores or publishers—for current textbook costs is unproductive and without merit. The report called on all parties within the industry to work together to find productive solutions, which included a movement toward [[open textbook]]s and other lower-cost digital solutions.

Textbook prices are considerably higher in law school. Students ordinarily pay close to $200 for case books consisting of cases available free online.

==Textbook bias on controversial topics==
In cases of history, science, current events, and political textbooks, "the writer might be biased towards one way or another. Topics such as actions of a country, presidential actions, and scientific theories are common potential biases".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Inclusive education ==
Textbooks are an important aspect of [[Inclusion (education)|inclusive education]] in how they incorporate inclusive language, diverse identities, and human rights, particularly as they reflect issues of culture, gender, and religion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002473/247337e.pdf|title=Making textbook content inclusive: A focus on religion, culture and gender|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100203-8|location=|pages=8–11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421001802/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002473/247337e.pdf|archivedate=2017-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===
The defense of [[cultural diversity]], as understood by [[UNESCO]], is an ethical imperative, inseparable from children’s universal [[right to education]]. It implies a commitment to the fundamental rights of persons belonging to minorities and to the [[cultural rights]] that are an integral part of [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 27, and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Articles 13 and 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Culture is also central to contemporary debates on citizenship and identity, social cohesion, and the growth of knowledge- based economies. Education has a major part to play in shaping such dialogues as cultural exchanges and economic cooperation become increasingly more common. Textbooks can be used to promote cultural diversity and, in particular, nurture culture in its broadest sense understood as the “whole complex of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features that characterize a society or social group.”&lt;ref&gt;Mexico City Declaration on Cultural Policies, World Conference on Cultural Policies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gender ===
Having concentrated on rooting out [[Racism|racist]] and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] prejudice in textbooks as early as 1946, in the 1970s UNESCO started to tackle [[gender stereotypes]], which are recognized as a source of enduring inequality between women and men. A research programme on the image of women was launched after the 1980 Copenhagen World Conference of the [[United Nations Decade for Women]] to identify and characterize sexism and recommend various steps to eliminate it.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Andrée Michel (1986). Down with stereotypes! Eliminating sexism from children’s literature and school textbooks. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; The programme showed that [[sexism]] in textbooks often consists of failing to recognize the range of actual roles played by men and women in society and neglecting the real advances that have been made in terms of gender equality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Textbooks should help students understand the roles most often assigned to women and men and recognize those aspects of social change needed to build a fairer social order that includes both sexes and [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]] on an equal footing with the mainstream society. Discussions prompted by reading textbooks and teacher-pupil interactions can be used to address, question, and dismiss stereotypes. Relating examples from past societies and telling stories that give prominence to other gender categories (besides men and women) and other [[sexual orientation]]s (besides [[heterosexuality]]) can show the prejudicial effect of the division of humankind into two sexes and the imposition of heterosexuality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Religion ===
With the rise of [[globalization]], the multiplicity of world views and religious practices that individuals confront has increased. Textbooks are instrumental in the process of raising awareness about others’ beliefs and fostering understanding of, and respect for, the diversity of beliefs present in societies and the world at large. Textbooks can help to combat prejudice, present pluralism as an asset, and encourage mutual understandings based on respect for the right to express one’s beliefs. They contribute to promoting tolerance, critical thinking in the face of divisive stereotyping and discrimination, and the independence of individual choice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''The Day I Shot Cupid: Hello, My Name Is Jennifer Love Hewitt and I'm a Love-aholic''''' (commonly abbreviated to ''The Day I Shot Cupid'') is a bestselling dating-advice book written by [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]. The book tells of Hewitt's personal dating experiences and gives advice to both men and women on dating life and what to look for in a member of the opposite sex.

==Development==
Hewitt has often been described as a 'serial dater' in the media and after many publicized relationships, rumors, and break-ups she revealed that she was planning on writing a relationship book. She has said she wanted to set the record straight on her love-life and talk about the rumors in a personal and honest way. Hewitt said in interviews that the name of the book came to her after she did some research about the god of desire ([[Cupid]]) and discovered that in the original [[myth]], after being scorned by love, Cupid didn't shoot people with arrows to make them fall in love, he shot them with poison arrows to make them fall ''out'' of love. Hewitt felt that she needed to 'shoot' Cupid to get him to stop.&lt;ref name="Foxtube"&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doILj8S7fbA Interview: Jennifer Love Hewitt]", ''[[Fox News]]'' (2010). Retrieved on 22 September 2010 via [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout writing the book, Hewitt was dating ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' co-star [[Jamie Kennedy]]. He wrote a chapter in the book where he writes that men usually prefer women with curves and 'booty', perhaps in relation to Hewitt's much publicized retaliation about the criticism of her weight by the media in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/24/jennifer-love-hewitt-show_n_510817.html Jennifer Love Hewitt Shows Some Leg To Sell Her Book ]", ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', 24 March 2010. Retrieved 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/12/06/earlyshow/leisure/celebspot/main3583440.shtml Jennifer Love Hewitt Takes On Bloggers]", ''[[CBS News]]'', 6 December 2007. Retrieved 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She and Kennedy later broke off their year-long relationship just before she began doing promotional tours and appearances for the book.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Tracy; "[http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/03/13/2010-03-13_jennifer_love_hewitt_and_jamie_kennedy_break_up.html Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jamie Kennedy break up]", ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', 13 March 2010. Retrieved 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She joked about this in some promotional interviews, saying "It wasn't ideal timing. Here's my relationship book and I'm single".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyxyhgtjZPc The Day I Shot Cupid: Jennifer Love Hewitt's Book]", ''[[TV Guide]]'', 22 March 2010. Retrieved 22 September 2010 via [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cover==
The cover features an image of a [[cartoon]] version of Hewitt kneeling down in a sleek dress. The title art shows a fallen [[Cupid]] slumped over his name after being shot in the back with Hewitt's [[metaphorical]] arrow. The back cover features a picture of Jennifer and the front and back flaps feature a brief synopsis of both the book and Hewitt respectively.

==Promotion==
Hewitt undertook a large promotional campaign leading up to the book's release. She was interviewed by many TV networks and talk-shows in the U.S. During the interviews she stressed that "despite what your pre-conceived notion about what my life is like or what people have written about me, I am just a girl like you."&lt;ref name="Foxtube"/&gt;

While promoting the book during a January, 2010, interview on ''[[Lopez Tonight]]'', Hewitt said that there is a chapter in it about "[[vajazzle|vajazzling]]" (decorating a woman's pubis with crystals or rhinestones). She said it looked "cute", revealed that she was currently vajazzled with "hot pink" crystals and recommended to all women that they should also try it and see how it can raise their confidence. This became a big internet hit with the video going [[viral video|viral]], widespread news coverage and the term "vajazzling" becoming one of the most searched terms on [[Google]] the next day.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2010/01/jennifer-love-hewitt-explains-her-precious-lady-jewels/1 Jennifer Love Hewitt Explains Her Precious Lady Jewels]", ''[[USA Today]]'', 13 January 2010. Retrieved 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?q=vajazzling&amp;date=2010-1-13&amp;sa=X Log: 13 January 2010]", [[Google Trends]], 13 January 2010. Retrieved 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Helium.com gave the book a positive review, saying "Jennifer Love Hewitt’s book provides some good guidelines for those that need to work on clarifying their relationship desires before trying to establish their relationships". Talesofwhimsy.com said the book was "charming, honest, zany, and real", adding that "This book is pure fun. I want a copy for my coffee table and single cousin". Crushable.com gave the book a mixed review, mentioning that "Hewitt is a trite and terrible writer - no getting around that - but she makes some good points". The book was commercially successful upon its release, becoming a [[New York Times bestseller|''New York Times'' bestseller]] within a week.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/books/bestseller/besthardadvice.html Hardcover Advice]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2 April 2010. Retrieved 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In June, 2011, Hewitt confirmed via her [[Twitter]] account that she was in the process of writing another book. Although no specific details were released, she stated that writing was "going well" and that she was excited about the project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/TheReal_Jlh/status/85883707344429056 TheReal_Jlh tweet], ''[[Twitter]]'', 29 June 2011.

'''''The News Letter of the LXIVmos''''' was a near-monthly publication edited by book collector James D. Henderson (writing as "The Scrivener") that ran from 1927 to 1929.{{refn|name=Edison}}  The twenty-one issues focused on [[miniature books]], of which Henderson's collection was already considered to be "the finest ... in the world" when he displayed it at Harvard University as an undergraduate in 1933.{{refn|name=Crimson}} The name comes from the book trade and is read "[[Book size|sixty-four-mos]]", meaning a sheet of paper folded 64 times to form a book with pages of three inches or smaller.{{refn|name=Edison}}  Henderson regularly printed answers from his readers to the question "Why collect miniature books since they are too small to read?", with responses ranging from saving space, to pedagogy, to "Everyone should have a hobby."{{refn|name=Pascoe}}

The editions were printed in a number of different cities around the world, including a special issue{{refn | name=BlackSun}} published by the [[Black Sun Press]] in Paris.{{refn|name=Minkoff}}  Robert Massmann and Ruth Adomeit published an index to the periodical in 1962.{{refn|name=Massmann}}  A [[facsimile]] edition of the complete run was issued in 1968.{{refn|name=facs}} LXIVmos inspired the creation of the later ''Miniature Book News''{{refn|name=Edison}} and is listed, along with several other works by Henderson, in the Miniature Book Society's ''Essential References for a Miniature Book Collector.''{{refn|name=MBS}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2423">[[Image:LotAndAberham.jpg|thumb|''The Parting of Lot and Abraham'' mosaic from Santa Maria Maggiore]]

'''''The Parting of Lot and Abraham''''' is one in a series of [[mosaic]] scenes, probably dating to the 430s, that decorate the nave wall of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], one of the most prominent [[basilica]]n churches in [[Rome]].  The mosaic shows the story in the biblical [[Book of Genesis]] of the parting of [[Abraham]] from his nephew, [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]], as they choose opposing paths.  Abraham (on the left) with [[Isaac]] and the rest of his family, chooses the road to [[Canaan]], 
as God intends him to, and Lot chooses to take his followers to [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred S. Gardner's Art Through the Ages : A Global History. 13th ed. Belmont: Wadsworth, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is a [[tessera]] mosaic, tessera describing the material making up the surface of the work. Most tessera works during this time would be made up of small pieces of limestone or marble, cut to shape, and arranged by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;"tessera." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 03 Feb. 2009 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/588629/tessera&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
The artist uses several conventions of the time.  The grouping of the characters is varied,  meant to create the illusion of space. This "shorthand" way of depicting a crowd is sometimes called a "head cluster".  There is a hieratic abandonment of consistent and realistic proportions and scale, allowing the artist to put emphasis on the characters of his choosing using attributes like size. The main characters we are intended to focus on are made extremely clear through this method, and the picture itself becomes less illustrative and more symbolic. Eventually this style comes to a refined maturity during the Middle Ages. The move towards completely two-dimensional representative images has already started, and although this mosaic implements the use of lights and darks, with shadows corresponding to the figures, there is a good indication as to what direction religious art is heading.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred S. Gardner's Art Through the Ages : A Global History. 13th ed. Belmont: Wadsworth, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Sodbury Players''' are a dramatic association well known throughout South-West [[England]], [[UK]]. They were founded in 1946 in [[Chipping Sodbury]], [[Gloucestershire]]. Sixty years on, they are affiliated to the [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] (NODA), and are members of [[Avon Association of Drama]] (AAD).

They perform four main productions each year, beginning with a pantomime in January, a spring production in May, an open-air production in August and an Autumn production in September. The Sodbury Players have also premièred several original works, including the three-act play ''[[Booze, Bungee and Blackleg]]'' by [[Steve Mercer]] and ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], adapted for the stage by [[Roy Whitlow]].

In addition to this, they enter a one-act play into the [[All England One Act Play Festival]] each year, which starts in February.

The Sodbury Players Youth Section(SPYS) placed in the top four in the country for the One Act festival.

'''The Tape-beatles''' (also known as '''Public Works''') are a multi-media group that formed in [[Iowa City]] in December 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Philip. "[http://pwp.detritus.net/news/interviews/blackburn-artpaper.html Meet the Tape-beatles]." ''Artpaper'' [Minneapolis, Minn.], vol. 12 no. 1, September 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its members have included [[Lloyd Dunn]], John Heck, Ralph Johnson, Paul Neff, and Linda Morgan Brown. Beginning with analog tape recorders, and later expanding to include digital technology and film media, the group has used collage techniques to create works that challenge the notion of intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;Metzer, David Joel. ''Quotation and Cultural Meaning in Twentieth-Century Music'', pp. 167-169. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Their works make extensive use of materials appropriated from various sources through a process they call "Plagiarism®". The Tape-beatles' body of work consists mainly of music and audio art recordings, expanded and performed cinema performances, videos, printed publications, as well as works in other media. They produce and release work under an umbrella organization called Public Works Productions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pwp.detritus.net Public Works Productions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Lineup and early years===
Members of The Tape-beatles currently include [[Lloyd Dunn]] and John Heck. Former or occasional members of the group have included Linda Morgan Brown, Chuck Hollister, Ralph Johnson, and Paul Neff. The group's initial focus was to create music that made use of techniques borrowed from [[musique concrète]], but applied to a popular music context. To this end, they eschewed conventional musical instruments, instead contending that tape recording and the recording studio itself was their 'instrument'. 

The Tape-beatles, then consisting of Dunn, Heck and Johnson, put out their first major work, ''A subtle buoyancy of pulse'' in 1988. In keeping with the tape esthetic, the work was available only on cassette (until being reissued 10 years later on CD by [[Staalplaat]], Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Public response was sufficiently encouraging that the group immediately began work on a new album, adding two new members along the way: Paul Neff and Linda Morgan Brown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://festivalofappropriation.org/bio_tapebeatles.html Festival of Appropriation - The Tape-beatles]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991–2000===
A grant from Intermedia Arts Minnesota enabled The Tape-beatles to finish their second work in 1991, a CD for the Canadian label [[DOVentertainment]], entitled ''Music with Sound''. This was the record that put The Tape-beatles on the map to some extent, garnering favorable reviews in ''Keyboard'',&lt;ref&gt;Dery, Mark. "[http://pwp.detritus.net/news/interviews/dery-keyboard.html Tape-beatles: Perfecting the Art of Plagiarism]." ''Keyboard Magazine'', September. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as putting them on the Top 10 Imports of the Year list in ''Pulse'' &lt;ref&gt;Ashby, Paul. "[http://pwp.detritus.net/news/interviews/ashby-pulse.html Tape-beatles plunder a media-mad culture]." Pulse, November, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; the in-store magazine for the Tower Records chain. It remains the work for which the Tape-beatles are the best-known. 

''Music with Sound'' not only established the group's signature style and technique,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.earlabs.org/label/LC/LC006.htm|title= LC006 - Tape-beatles - Music With Sound|website=EARLabs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130073202/http://www.earlabs.org/label/LC/LC006.htm|archive-date=November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also provided The Tape-beatles with a coherent soundtrack upon which to base a live public performance. Using multiple image projection devices (16 and 8&amp;nbsp;mm film on reels and loops, film strips and slide projectors), as well as an array of strange and obsolete recording equipment culled from audiovisual surplus outlets (the 'language master', the 'calophone', the 'wollensak', etc.). The presentation was a barrage of discarded educational and motivational material put to a musical score that varied from the bombastic to the delicate and subtly constructed. The climax of the piece found the audience being surrounded by a single room-sized tape loop.

The year 1993 saw the release of ''The Grand Delusion'' (Staalplaat), a bitter mediation on the U.S. Persian [[Gulf War]] and the historical context that created it.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Godfrey. "[http://deuceofclubs.com/write/tapebeat.htm Conversation with a Tape-beatle].' ''X Magazine'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the group refined their presentation approach, distilling it down to just three 16&amp;nbsp;mm projectors, used in a configuration the group named 'Polyvision', in honor of [[Abel Gance]]'s pioneering movie techniques of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelsen, Grant. [http://pwp.detritus.net/news/reviews/emptybottle.html "The Tape-beatles Live at The Empty Bottle".]" Projector no. 10: Chicago Cultural Guide, June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; (Later this technique was renamed 'expanded cinema', and eventually 'performed cinema', by the group.)

In the meantime, Ralph Johnson moved to Oakland, Calif., to study composition at Mills College. [[Lloyd Dunn]] suspended all zine production (see [http://psrf.detritus.net PhotoStatic Magazine]) and went on a yearlong trip abroad, spending most of the time in France (see [http://xp.detritus.net The Expatriot]), but also dropping in on John Heck, then living in Prague.

Upon Dunn's return to the United States, he and Ralph Johnson regrouped to form the duo Public Works. Using similar principles to the Tape-beatles, Public Works laid the focus on digital audio production, and tightened the emphasis on the making of music, with a reduced emphasis on pure sound collage or 'audio art'. 1997's ''Matter'' (Staalplaat) was the group's début recording. An 'expanded cinema' performance of that name was also created, and the group performed that and ''The Grand Delusion'' in a dozen cities from San Francisco to Berlin, Germany.

In 2000, Public Works released the EP ''Numbers'' on the Elevator Bath label. It explored the sounds of EVP ([[Electronic voice phenomenon]]) recordings, purported to document paranormal phenomena, and the so-called "[[numbers station]]s" that can occasionally be heard on the shortwave band. Some of the works sampled liberally from Akin Fernandez' "[[The Conet Project]]" recordings.

===2001–present===
John Heck rejoined the group to work on a new proposed work for The Tape-beatles that would be called ''Good Times''.&lt;ref&gt;Kimm, Todd. "[http://pwp.detritus.net/news/interviews/kimm-icon.html Meet the Tape-beatles]." ''Icon'' [Iowa City, Ia.] January, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A long-term project, it was envisioned from the start that the composition would take its full form as an audio visual presentation. The work was completed September, 2001. It premiered at the Sound Unseen Film Festival in Minneapolis, USA in October 2001, which also inaugurated a Tape-beatle tour of the US Midwest.

At the Sound Unseen Festival (Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn., October, 2001), The Tape-beatles took an afternoon to improvise with fellow sound-collage artists [[Escape Mechanism]] (Jon Nelson), Steev Hise and Wobbly (Jon Leidecker). The result was the mini-CD and mini-VideoCD ''Minneapolis Summit''. 

More recently, The Tape-beatles have been performing their retrospective 'performed cinema' performance entitled "G.N.P.", compiled from their previous film performances, throughout Europe in 2005. Both Heck and Dunn currently reside in [[Prague]], the [[Czech republic]].

In 2007, the group was asked to provide 28 minutes of programming for [http://www.radia.fm The Radia Network] a series that highlights electronic and experimental sound work. The program was put together from older previously unreleased material, with a generous selection of new work. That same year, the Tape-beatles were commissioned by Czech Radio to produce a 24-minute composition for broadcast as part of the series [http://www.rozhlas.cz/radiocustica/portal/ rAdioCUSTICA], edited by Michal Rataj. The resulting work, "Sombre Gertrude - Piece for Stings," was first broadcast in January 2008.

'''Winston Branch''' (born in 1947) is a British artist originally from [[Saint Lucia]], the [[Sovereign state|sovereign]] island in the Caribbean Sea.&lt;ref name=Popovic&gt;{{cite journal|last=Popovic|first=Caroline|title=Winston Branch: The Precarious Life of Art|journal=Caribbean Beat|date=December 1995|issue=16|url=http://caribbean-beat.com/issue-16/winston-branch-precarious-life-art}}&lt;/ref&gt; He still has a home there, while maintaining a studio in [[California]]. Branch was the recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1978,&lt;ref name=Guggenheim&gt;{{cite web|title=Winston Branch|url=http://www.gf.org/search?search=winston+branch&amp;x=0&amp;y=0|publisher=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[British Prix de Rome]], a DAAD ([[German Academic Exchange Service]]) Fellowship to [[Berlin]], a sponsorship to [[Belize]] from the [[Organization of American States]], and was Artist in Residence at [[Fisk University]] in [[Tennessee]]. He has been a professor of fine arts and has taught at several art institutions in London and in the US. He has also worked as a theatrical set designer with various theatre groups.

As described by art critic Carlos Diaz Sosa, Branch paints "abstract canvases in cool, cloudy colours that have a quality which allow the viewer to explore the depths of the mind. Branch uses paint like a symbol, a purely aesthetic language, an illustration of spirit."&lt;ref name=Popovic /&gt;

== Early years and education ==
Born in [[Castries]], Saint Lucia, Branch attended a Catholic school there,&lt;ref name=KCWT /&gt; before being sent to [[London]] at the age of 12 in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/radio4/fm/1992-11-02 ''Work Talk''], BBC Radio 4, November 1992. Interview by [[Ferdinand Dennis]].&lt;/ref&gt; He explains: "My parents saw I had an aptitude for art and wanted to give me the best opportunity."&lt;ref name=SommerJulia /&gt; He studied at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]], [[University College London]], where his talent was recognized early, and after graduating in 1970 he won the prestigious [[British Prix de Rome]], enabling him at the age of 24 to attend the [[British School at Rome]] for a year (1971–72).&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Wendy|title=A matter of survival—a portrait of Winston Branch|journal=Women's Studies|date=1 January 1999|volume=28|issue=3|pages=281–290|doi=10.1080/00497878.1999.9979260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Amon Saba Saakana notes: "Branch had a first hand experience of the Renaissance masters and subsequent developments of art movements in Europe. And though he ingested these European masters, he was searching for a form that incorporated and reflected his beginnings in the Caribbean. Though first working in the figurative tradition, he moved to abstracts as he apprehended the world of colour reflected in the cosmos, lightning, volcanoes, tropical storms, and earthquakes."&lt;ref name=KCWT&gt;Saakana, Amon, [http://www.kcwtoday.co.uk/2015/10/12/winston-branch-a-painter-at-the-crossroads/ "Winston Branch: A painter at the crossroads"], ''Kensington, Chelsea &amp; Westminster Today'', 12 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
In 1971, Branch was a visiting tutor at Hornsey College of Art and at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmith's College of Art, London University]]. His first visit to the US was as Artist-in-Residence at [[Fisk University]], [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1973, and in the UK between 1973 and 1992 he also taught at [[Kingston School of Art]], [[Chelsea Art School]] and at the Slade School.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;[http://www.winstonbranch.com/pdf/winstonBranch_CV_May2005.pdf "Winston Branch CV".]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a professor of art at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and at [[Kansas State University]].&lt;ref name=SommerJulia&gt;{{cite news|last=Sommer|first=Julia|title=Painter Winston Branch — Visiting Artist Shares His 'Great Love' for Painting and Education|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/1999/0310/branch.html|date=10 March 1999|accessdate=6 January 2013|newspaper=Berkeleyan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also given several public lectures, including at [[Oakland Museum of California]], at the [[Beach Museum of Art]], Kansas State University, and at Barrows Hall, University of California at Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2000/02/02/bhm_events.html "Wednesday, Feb. 9: Modernity Out of the Calabash — The Art and Artists of the Caribbean, Part I: A lecture by Winston Branch"], Black History Month: Events, February 2000. ''Berkeleyan'', February 2 – 8, 2000 (Volume 28, Number 20).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
Branch has exhibited his work consistently since the 1960s, including at the [[Oakland Museum of California]], the [[Alliance Francaise de San Francisco]], the permanent collection of the [[Berkeley Art Museum]], the 11th and 23rd [[São Paulo Art Biennial]], Museo de Arte Moderno in São Paulo, the 4th Bienal de Pincture de Cuenca, Modern Art Museum ([[Cuenca, Ecuador]]) and the [[Biennale de Paris]], [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]] and the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]].&lt;ref name=CV /&gt;

In 2010 he fell ill while at [[San Francisco International Airport]] waiting for a flight in order to exhibit work and give a lecture at the Museum of Modern Art in [[Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic]], and was cared for at the [[Alta Bates Summit Medical Center]], where following his recovery he held an exhibition entitled ''A Gift of Life'' (1 May–24 June 2011).&lt;ref&gt;"Gallery Exhibit — Tribute to Alta Bates Summit Staff", ''Winston Branch: "A Gift of Life" (exhibition brochure).&lt;/ref&gt; He has subsequently spent more time in London, where he has a close longtime association with the [[Chelsea Arts Club]].&lt;ref name=KCWT /&gt;

Most recently, he was one of the artists featured prominently in ''[[No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960–1990]]'' (July 2015–January 2016) at the [[City of London]]'s [[Guildhall Art Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;Axtell, William, [http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/art531290-guildlhall-celebrates-black-british-artists-with-no-colour-bar-black-british-art-in-action-1960-1990 "Guildhall celebrates black British artists with No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action"], Culture24, 9 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://huntleysonline.com/the-artists/ "The Artists' Profiles"], FHALMA, huntleysonline.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KCWT /&gt; with three of his paintings hung at the entrance of the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Tresadern, Molly, [https://artuk.org/discover/stories/ten-black-british-artists-to-celebrate "Ten black British artists to celebrate"], [[Art UK]], 23 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the works shown was his painting ''West Indian'' — "a marked exception" to the non-figurative style now more typical of Branch&lt;ref name=EC /&gt; — on loan from Rugby Borough Council's respected collection of 20th- and 21st-century British art, which also includes works by [[L. S. Lowry]], [[Barbara Hepworth]], [[Stanley Spencer]] and [[Bridget Riley]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rugby.gov.uk/news/article/1193/rugby_collection_painting_features_in_prestigious_london_exhibition "Rugby Collection painting features in prestigious London exhibition — A Painting from the Rugby Collection has been loaned to London's Guildhall Art Gallery for a prestigious national exhibition"], Rugby Borough Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

From early on in his career, Branch's work has won recognition and awards, such as the British Prix de Rome in 1971, a DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) Fellowship to Berlin in 1976, and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1978&lt;ref name=Guggenheim /&gt; (in which year he was featured in the international quarterly journal ''Black Art'').&lt;ref name=EC&gt;[[Eddie Chambers (artist)|Chambers, Eddie]], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OfBeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT171&amp;lpg=PT171&amp;dq=%22winston+branch%22+Black+Art+an+international+quarterly&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cfmX4vaUH6&amp;sig=gN-MNcctfHuU-gJTCb9UuCjQ9fo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1hPGsgdPKAhXCRBQKHYRODuQQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22winston%20branch%22%20Black%20Art%20an%20international%20quarterly&amp;f=false ''Black Artists in British Art: A History from 1950 to the Present''], I.B.Tauris, 2014, pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simolke, David, "Winston Branch: A Study in Contrast", ''Black Art: an international quarterly'', Volume 2, Number 2, Winter 1978: 4–8.&lt;/ref&gt;
