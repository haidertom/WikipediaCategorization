'''Active shooter''' or '''active killer''' names the perpetrator of a type of [[mass murder]] marked by rapidity, scale, randomness, and often suicide. The [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] defines an ''active shooter'' as "an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area; in most cases, active shooters use firearms and there is no pattern or method to their selection of victims."&lt;ref name="dhs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/active_shooter_booklet.pdf |format=PDF |work=Active Shooter Booklet |title= U.S. Department of Homeland Security Active Shooter Response}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most incidents occur at locations in which the killers find little impediment in pressing their attack. Locations are generally described as ''soft targets'', that is, they carry limited security measures to protect members of the public. In most instances, shooters commit suicide, are shot by police, or surrender when confrontation with responding law enforcement becomes unavoidable, and active shooter events are often over in 10 to 15 minutes.&lt;ref name="dhs"/&gt; According to [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) statistics, 46{{nbsp}}percent of active shooter incidents are ended by the application of force by police or security, 40{{nbsp}}percent end in the shooter's suicide, 14{{nbsp}}percent of the time the shooter surrenders and, in less than 1{{nbsp}}percent of cases, the violence ends with the attacker fleeing.&lt;ref name="The Active Shooter Threat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msasecurity.net/Portals/91068/docs/MSA%20Special%20Analysis%20-%20Active%20Shooter%20Threat%208.20.12.pdf |format=PDF |work=MSA Special Analysis |title= The Active Shooter Threat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
In police training manuals, the police response to an active shooter scenario is different from [[hostage]] rescue and barricaded suspect situations.&lt;ref&gt;https://info.publicintelligence.net/LAactiveshootertactics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbrt.lsu.edu/images/news/tacticalmagazine.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Police officers responding to an armed barricaded suspect often deploy with the intention of containing the suspect within a perimeter, gaining information about the situation, attempting negotiation with the suspect, and waiting for specialist teams like [[SWAT]].

If police officers believe that a gunman intends to kill as many people as possible before committing suicide, they may use a tactic like [[Immediate Action Rapid Deployment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/abstractdb/AbstractDBDetails.aspx?id=240814|title=Abstracts Database - National Criminal Justice Reference Service|website=www.ncjrs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/fs-fd/iard-drai-eng.htm|title=Immediate Action Rapid Deployment (IARD) Program|first=Government of Canada, RCMP, Public Affairs and Communication Services Directorate, Corporate|last=Communications|website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminology "active shooter" is critiqued by some academics. There have been several mass stabbings that have high casualty counts, for instance in Belgium ([[Dendermonde nursery attack]]), Canada ([[2014 Calgary stabbing]]), China ([[2008 Beijing Drum Tower stabbings]]), Japan ([[Osaka School Massacre]] and [[Sagamihara stabbings]]), and Pennsylvania ([[Franklin Regional High School stabbing]]). Ron Borsch recommends the phrase "rapid mass murder". Due to a worldwide increase in firearm and non-firearm based Mass Casualty Attacks (including attacks with [[Vehicle-ramming attack|vehicles]], [[Improvised explosive device|explosives]], [[incendiary device]]s, [[Stabbing as a terrorist tactic|stabbings]], [[Slashing (crime)|slashing]], [[Acid throwing|acid attacks]]), Dr. Tau Braun and the Violence Prevention Agency (VPA) has encouraged the use of the more accurate descriptor Mass Casualty Attacker (MCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eventscribe.com/2016/NACCHOSummit/QRcode.asp?Pres=134403|title=2016 Preparedness Summit|website=eventscribe.com|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tactical implications ==
Active shooters do not negotiate, killing as many people as possible, often to gain notoriety. Active shooters generally do not lie in wait to battle responding law enforcement officers. Few law enforcement officers have been injured responding to active shooter incidents; fewer still have been killed.&lt;ref name="Borsch"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ron |first1=Borsch |title=Solo Officer Entry for Active Shooters: Ron Borsch Q&amp;A Part 1 |url=http://www.spartancops.com/solo-officer-entry-active-shooters-ron-borsch-qa-part-1/ |website=Spartan Cops |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403072901/http://www.spartancops.com/solo-officer-entry-active-shooters-ron-borsch-qa-part-1/ |archivedate=April 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted, more often than not, when the prospect of confrontation with responding law enforcement becomes unavoidable, the active shooter commits suicide. And when civilians—even unarmed civilians—resist, the active shooter crumbles.

Borsch's statistical analysis recommends a tactic: aggressive action. For law enforcement, the tactical imperative is to respond and engage the killer without delay{{nsmdns}}the affected [[orthodoxy]] of cumbersome team formations fails to answer the rapid temporal dynamics of active shooter events and fails to grasp the nature of the threat involved. For civilians, when necessity or obligation calls, the tactical mandate is to attack the attacker—a strategy that has proved successful across a range of incidents from Norina Bentzel ([[William Michael Stankewicz]]) in Pennsylvania and Bill Badger in Arizona ([[2011 Tucson shooting]]) to David Benke in Colorado.

== Taxonomy ==
{{original research|date=May 2018}}
The active shooter incidents do not always meet the classification of a mass murder.  Mass murders result when three or more individuals are killed. The definition of an active shooter does not require that victims are killed, only that they are injured or wounded by the act.  Not all mass murderers are active shooters. Noting the similarities and differences among several types of mass murder will help to isolate and define what is meant by the term "active shooter".

Mass murderers defy traditional criminal categorization. The goal of the mass murderer is neither to defend nor appropriate turf or territory, neither to initiate himself into nor elevate his status within a criminal organization. The mass murderer does not kill for drugs or money. The [[serial killer]] is one kind of mass murderer. He claims many lives in multiple events across time. The events are discontinuous, punctuated by "a cooling-off period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor-last1=Morton|editor-first1=R. |title=Serial Murder: Multi-Disciplinary Perspectives for Investigators|journal=Federal Bureau of Investigation|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the active shooter claims many lives in a single event along a compressed frame of time. In practice, this appears to carry a corollary: broadly, the serial killer seeks anonymity; the active shooter, notoriety. Repetition through multiple events across time answers the pathology of the serial killer. Savage as they are, his acts are not designed to excite publicity. The serial killer will conceal a corpse or bury evidence. He wants to kill again. By contrast, the active shooter seeks infamy through slaughter. He means to fuse his name forever to a place, a date, an event. Thus, his acts are designed to maximize publicity. Accordingly, he (generally) plans no escape.

The serial killer murders at close quarters, delighting in experiencing the horror of his victims as he shares their space. In his distorted estimation, his victims "mean" something to him, and he may secure keepsakes from victims to memorialize the "relationship". The active shooter also murders at close quarters. He delights in experiencing the horror of his victims as he shares their space. Crucially, however, while the victims of the serial killer "mean" something to him, to the active shooter they mean nothing. The active shooter moves rapidly from one victim to the next.

Modell speculates that the contrast is rooted in the peculiar form of abuse each suffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Modell|first1=Daniel|title=The Psychology of the Active Killer|journal=Law Enforcement Executive Forum|date=December 2013|volume=13|issue=4|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The serial killer is a victim of physical/sexual/emotional abuse.&lt;ref name=DeBecker&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeBecker|first1=Gavin|title=The Gift of Fear|date=1999|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such abuse is administered at length, over time, by those who, by relation or connection, should care for the abused. The serial killer, after a manner, models this behavior. The active shooter is a victim of bullying.&lt;ref name=Vossekuil&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vossekuil|first1=B.|last2=Fein|first2=R.|last3=Reddy|first3=M.|last4=Borum|first4=R.|last5=Modzeleski|first5=W.|title=The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School Initiative|journal=US Secret Service and US Department of Education|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though bullying may persist over time, it is delivered in discrete, relatively short-lived acts, often by multiple actors with no special relation or connection to the abused. The active shooter, after a manner, models this behavior.

A portrait of the active shooter may be sharpened by contrasting him with another type of mass murderer, the ideological killer.  The [[Oklahoma City bombing]] exemplifies the type: in 1995, a man with ties to a disorganized [[militia]] movement detonated a truck bomb in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in downtown Oklahoma City, and the resulting blast ended 168{{nbsp}}lives while wounding{{nbsp}}680.

The ideological killer is driven by adherence to ethico-political or religious orthodoxy. His actions are an expression of that orthodoxy. By contrast, while the active shooter may conceive of himself as "making a statement" of sorts, his motives appear more personal and desultory.

Like the active shooter, the ideological killer plans multiple murders within the confines of a single event. But the active shooter seeks to experience the horror of his victims at close quarters. The ideological killer does not. He kills at a distance. He plants explosive devices or takes up position as a sniper. Killing at a distance suits his primary motive—the expression of adherence to an abstract orthodoxy. For the ideological killer, victims are of incidental significance. He need not "know" them, as the serial killer must, nor experience their horror, as the active shooter must. For the ideological killer, abstraction is reality, the individual but a construct in an interminable struggle of dogmas.

Since he is motivated by adherence to orthodoxy, the ideological killer typically seeks notoriety for his cause through carnage. While the active shooter too seeks notoriety, and while he too maps a careful plan of the event, there is a crucial difference in the pursuit. The ideological killer generally means to elude capture, to live beyond the event (as does the serial killer). The active shooter merges his identity with the event and sees nothing beyond.

Integrating the elements elicited by comparison and contrast, the "active shooter (killer)" may be defined as a mass murderer who kills (or attempts to kill) at close-quarters, in multiples, at random in a single, planned event.

== Causation ==

Accounts of why active shooters do what they do vary. Some contend that the motive, at least proximately, is vengeance.&lt;ref name=McGee&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGee |first1=J.P. |last2=DeBernardo |first2=C.R. |title=The Classroom Avenger |url=http://www.sheppardpratt.org/Documents/classavenger.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030111558/https://www.sheppardpratt.org/Documents/classavenger.pdf |archivedate=October 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that bullying breeds the problem, and sometimes the active shooter is a victim of bullying, directly or derivatively.&lt;ref name=Vossekuil /&gt; Still others such as Grossman and DeGaetano argue that the pervasiveness of violent imagery girding modern culture hosts the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grossman|first1=D.|last2=DeGaetano|first2=G.|title=Stop Teaching our Kids to Kill|date=1999|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that a particular interpretation of the world, a conscious or subconscious ontology, accounts for the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Modell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Modell|first1=Daniel|title=The Psychology of the Active Killer|journal=Law Enforcement Executive Forum|date=December 2013|volume=13|issue=4|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the active shooter lives in a world of victims and victimizers, that [[splitting (psychology)|all are one or the other]]. The ontology accommodates no nuance, no room between the categories for benevolence, friendship, decency, nor indeed, for a mixture of good and bad. His interpretation of the world may grow out of or be fed by bullying or violent imagery (hence the common obsession with violent movies, books or video games), but it is the absolutist interpretation of his world that drives him both to kill and to die.

In ''The Psychology of the Active Killer'', [[Daniel Modell]] writes that "The world conceived by the active killer is a dark dialectic of victim and victimizer. His impoverished [[ontology]] brooks no nuance, admits no resolution. The [[false dichotomy|two categories]], isolated and absolute, exhaust and explain his world. And the peculiar logic driving the dialectic yields a fatal inference: in a world of victims and victimizers, success means victimization."&lt;ref name=Modell /&gt;

Many government installations, businesses, campuses have camera and sensor based security systems, some analog and, more recently, digital.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Some also include formal Command Centers or at least are monitored by personnel in any organization.{{Clarify|date=September 2018}}  These provide very good forensic support in documenting an active shooter. However they offer only mixed results in the timely interdiction of an active shooter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The '''Alexander Technique''', named after its creator [[Frederick Matthias Alexander]], is an educational process that was created to retrain habitual patterns of movement and posture. Alexander believed that [[Poor posture|poor habits in posture]] and movement damaged spatial [[self-awareness]] as well as health, and that movement efficiency could support overall physical well-being. He saw the technique as a mental training technique as well.&lt;ref name=bloch/&gt;{{rp|221}}

Alexander began developing his technique's principles in the 1890s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rootberg | first = Ruth | title = Voice and Gender and other contemporary issues in professional voice and speech training | journal =  Voice and Speech Review | pages = 164–170 |date=September 2007 | issue = 1 | doi =  | volume = 35 | editor= Mandy Rees}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to address [[voice loss]] during public speaking.&lt;ref name=bloch/&gt;{{rp|34–35}} He credited his method with allowing him to pursue his passion for reciting in [[Shakespearean]] theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harer |first1=John B. |last2=Munden |first2=Sharon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f8RlC8aE5foC&amp;dq |title=The Alexander Technique Resource Book: A Reference Guide |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2008 |pages= xii - xiii |isbn=978-0810863927 |accessdate=2014-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of the Alexander Technique say that it addresses a variety of health conditions related to cumulative physical behaviors but there is little evidence to support these claims.&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt;&lt;ref name="NHS"/&gt; As of 2015 there was evidence suggesting the Alexander Technique may be helpful for long-term [[back pain]], long-term [[neck pain]], and may help people cope with [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name="NHS"&gt;{{cite web|author1=NHS |title=Alexander Technique - NHS Choices |url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alexander-technique/Pages/Introduction.aspx|website=www.nhs.uk|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Frederick Matthias Alexander (1869–1955) was a Shakespearean [[orator]] from [[Tasmania]], who developed voice loss during his unamplified performances. After doctors found no physical cause, Alexander reasoned that he was inadvertently damaging himself while speaking. He observed himself in multiple mirrors and saw that he was contracting his posture in preparation for any speech. He hypothesized that a habitual conditioned pattern (of pulling his head backwards and downwards) needlessly was disrupting the normal working of his total postural, breathing, and vocal processes.

With experimentation, Alexander developed the ability to stop the unnecessary and habitual contracting in his neck, displacement of his head, and shortening of his stature. As he became practised at speaking without these interferences, he found that his problem with recurrent voice loss was resolved. While on a recital tour in [[New Zealand]] (1895), he came to believe in the wider significance of improved carriage for overall physical functioning although evidence from his own publications appears to indicate it happened less systematically and over a long period of time.&lt;ref name=bloch&gt;{{cite book | last = Bloch | first = Michael | title = F.M. : the life of Frederick Matthias Alexander : founder of the Alexander technique | publisher = Little, Brown | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-316-86048-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36}}

===Influence===

The American [[philosopher]] and [[educator]] [[John Dewey]] became impressed with the Alexander Technique after his [[headache]]s, [[neck pain]]s, [[blurred vision]], and [[Psychological stress|stress]] symptoms largely improved during the time he used Alexander's advice to change his posture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ryan, Alan |title=John Dewey and the high tide of American liberalism |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=1997 |pages=187–188 |isbn=0-393-31550-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, Dewey wrote the introduction to Alexander's ''Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual''.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Alexander, ''Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual'', E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1923, {{ISBN|0-913111-11-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aldous Huxley]] had transformative lessons with Alexander, and continued doing so with other teachers after moving to the US. He rated Alexander's work highly enough to base the character of the doctor who saves the protagonist in '[[Eyeless in Gaza (novel)|Eyeless in Gaza]]' (an experimental form of autobiographical work) on F.M. Alexander, putting many of his phrases into the character's mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Aldous Huxley, ''Eyeless in Gaza'', Chatto &amp; Windus, 1936 {{ISBN|978-0-06172-489-3}} F. M. Alexander is named in the last section of Chapter 2.  Miller, the character whose description immediately resembles Alexander, appears at the beginning of Chapter 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley's work 'The Art of Seeing' also discusses his views on the technique.

Sir [[Stafford Cripps]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Henry Irving]] and other stage grandees, [[Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]] and other eminent people of the era also wrote positive appreciations of his work after taking lessons with Alexander.

Since Alexander's work in the field came at the start of the 20th century, his ideas influenced many originators in the field of mind-body improvement. [[Fritz Perls]], who originated [[Gestalt&amp;nbsp;therapy]], credited Alexander as an inspiration for his psychological work.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Tengwall|first=Roger
|title=A note on the influence of F.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;Alexander on the development of gestalt therapy

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mitzvah Technique]] was influenced by the Alexander Technique; as was the [[Feldenkrais Method]] - who expanded on the one exercise in Alexander Technique called "The Whispered Ah."

==Process==

Alexander's approach emphasizes awareness strategies applied to conducting oneself while in action, (which could be now called '[[Mindfulness|mindful]]' action, though in his four books he did not use that term.)

Actions such as sitting, [[Squatting position|squatting]], lunging or walking are often selected by the teacher. Other actions may be selected by the student that is tailored to their interests or work activities: hobbies, computer use, lifting, driving or artistic performance or practice, sports, speech or horseback riding. Alexander teachers often use themselves as examples. They demonstrate, explain, and analyze a student's moment-to-moment responses as well as using mirrors, video feedback or classmate observations. Guided modelling with a highly skilled light hand contact is the primary tool for detecting and guiding the student into a more coordinated state in movement and at rest during in-person lessons. Suggestions for improvements are often student-specific, as everyone starts out with slightly different habits.&lt;ref name="Arnold 1997"&gt;{{cite web | last = Arnold | first = Joan |author2=Hope Gillerman | title =  Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = American Society for the Alexander Technique | year = 1997 | url = http://www.alexandertech.org/misc/faq.html | accessdate =2 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise as a teaching tool is deliberately omitted because of a common mistaken assumption that there exists a "correct" position. There are only two specific procedures that are practiced by the student; the first is lying [[Supine position#Semi-supine|semi-supine]]. Resting in this way uses "mechanical advantage" as a means of redirecting long-term and short-term accumulated muscular tension into a more integrated and balanced state. This position is sometimes referred to as "constructive rest", or "the balanced resting state". It's also a specific time to practice Alexander's principle of [[conscious]] "directing" without "doing". The second exercise is the "Whispered Ah", which is used to co-ordinate freer breathing and vocal production.

Freedom, efficiency and patience are the prescribed values. Proscribed are unnecessary effort, self-limiting habits as well as mistaken perceptual conclusions about the nature of training and experimentation. Students are led to change their largely automatic routines that are interpreted by the teacher to currently or cumulatively be physically limiting, inefficient, or not in keeping with best "use" of themselves as a whole. The Alexander teacher provides verbal coaching while monitoring, guiding and preventing unnecessary habits at their source with a specialized hands-on assistance.&lt;ref name="ptjournal.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cacciatore | first1 = W | title = Improvement in Automatic Postural Coordination Following Alexander Technique Lessons in a Person With Low Back Pain | url = http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/content/full/85/6/565 | journal = Physical Therapy | volume = 85 | issue = 6 | page = 565 | display-authors = etal | access-date = 15 July 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029170552/http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/content/full/85/6/565 | archive-date = 29 October 2006 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This specialized hands-on skill also allows Alexander teachers to bring about a balanced working of the student's supportive musculature as it relates to gravity's downward pull from moment to moment. Often, students require a great deal of hands-on work in order to first gain an experience of a fully poised relation to gravity and themselves. The hands-on skill requires Alexander teachers to maintain in themselves from moment-to-moment their own improved psycho-physical co-ordination that the teacher is [[communicating]] to the student.&lt;ref name="ptjournal.org"/&gt;

Alexander developed terminology to describe his methods, outlined in his four books that explain the experience of learning and substituting new improvements.

;Constructive Conscious Control
:Alexander insisted on the need for strategic reasoning because [[kinesthetic]] and [[proprioceptive]] sensory awareness are relative senses, not truthful indicators of a person's factual relationships within him/herself or within the environment. A person's habitual neuro-muscular relation to gravity is habitually sensed internally as "normal," despite being inefficient. Alexander's term, "debauched sensory appreciation" describes how the [[wikt:repetition|repetition]] of an action or response encourages the formation of habits as a person adapts to various circumstances or builds skills. Once trained and forgotten, completed habits may be used without feedback sensations that these habits are in effect, (even when only thinking about the situations that elicit them.)&lt;ref&gt;''Body_Learning – An_Introduction to the Alexander Technique'', Macmillan, 1996 {{ISBN|0805042067}}, quote p. 74, an article in New Scientist by Professor John Basmajian entitled "Conscious Control of Single Nerve Cells"&lt;/ref&gt; Short-sighted habits are capable of becoming harmfully exaggerated over time, such as restricted breathing or other habitually assumed adaptations to past circumstances. Even exaggerated habits will stop after learning to perceive and prevent them.

;End-gaining
:Another example is the term "end-gaining". This term means to focus on a goal so as to lose sight of the "means-whereby"&lt;ref&gt;The subject of "Means whereby, rather than the end, to be considered" is discussed many times in ''Man's Supreme Inheritance'', typically Chapter VI, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; the goal could be most appropriately achieved. According to Alexander teachers, "end-gaining" increases the likelihood of automatically selecting older or multiple conflicting coping strategies. End-gaining is usually carried out because an imperative priority of impatience or frustration justifies it. Excessive speed in thinking and acting often facilitates end-gaining. Going slowly is a strategy to undo "end-gaining."

;Inhibition
:In the Alexander Technique lexicon, the principle of "inhibition" is considered by teachers to be the most important to gaining improved "use." F.M. Alexander's selection of this word predates the meaning of the word originated by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Inhibition, or 'intentional inhibition'. It is the act of refraining from responding in one's habitual manner - in particular, imposed tension in neck muscles (see Primary Control). Inhibition describes a moment of conscious awareness of a choice to interrupt, stop or entirely prevent an unnecessary habitual "misuse". As unnecessary habits are prevented or interrupted, a freer capacity and range of motion resumes and a more spontaneous choice of action or behavior can be discovered, which is experienced by the student as a state of "non-doing" or "allowing."

;Primary control
:How the eyes and head initiate movement governs the training of ourselves in relationship to gravity. Our responses are influenced for good or ill by the qualities of head and eye direction at the inception of any reaction. The qualities and direction of our "primary control" occur in every waking moment in response to the stimulus to 'do" - everything. A person can learn to influence their primary control, improving effortlessness. This influence involves the education of a particular quality of head, neck, torso, and limb relationship that works as we move and respond. A student learns to pay attention during action, without imposing expectations.

;Directions
:To continue to select and reinforce the often less dominant new ways, it is recommended to repeatedly suggest, by thinking to oneself, a particular series of "Orders" or "Directions." "Giving Directions" is the expression used for thinking and projecting the positive aspect of how one's self might be used in the most unified psycho-physical way as conveyed by the teacher's hands during a lesson. 
"Directing" serves to counteract the common backward and downward pull and shortening in stature that can be detected at the beginning of every movement - particularly addressing a startle pattern of "fight, flight or freeze." A mere thought, as a projection of intention, shapes preparatory movement below the level of sensing it. Alexander used these words for reshaping these subliminal preparations: "The neck to be free, the head to go forward and up, the back to lengthen and widen."  Some teachers have shortened this to a suggestion of, "Freer?" Negative directions (that use Alexander's other preventive principle of "inhibition") have also been found to be effective, because negative directions leave the positive response open-ended.
Whichever is used, all "Directing" is suggestively thought, (rather than willfully accomplished.) This is because the neuro-muscular responses to "Directing" often occur underneath one's ability to perceive how they are actually carried out neuro-physiologically and neuro-cognitively. As freedom of expression or movement is the objective, the most appropriate responses cannot be anticipated or expected, only observed and chosen in the moment. 
Teacher trainees gradually learn to include a constant attending to their lengthening in stature in every movement. It becomes a basis for initiating and continuing every action, every response to stimuli or while remaining constructively at rest.

;Psycho-physical unity
:Global concepts such as "Psycho-physical Unity" and "Use" describe how thinking strategies and attention work together during preparation for an action or for withholding one. They connote the general sequence of how intention joins together with execution to directly affect the perception of events and the outcome of intended results.&lt;ref name=actor&gt;{{cite book|title=The Actor and the Alexander Technique|pages=14|isbn=0-312-29515-4|first=Kelly|last= McEvenue|location=New York|publisher= Macmillan|year= 2002|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ixvTPRlcSMoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

The Alexander Technique is used and taught by classically trained vocal coaches and musicians in schools and private lessons. Its advocates state that it allows for a balanced use of all aspects of the vocal tract by consciously increasing air-flow, allowing improved vocal skill and tone.  The method is said by actors to reduce [[stage fright]] and to increase spontaneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aronson | first = AE | title = Clinical Voice Disorders: An Interdisciplinary Approach, | year = 1990 | publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers | isbn=0-86577-337-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alexander Technique is a frequent component in acting training, because it can assist the actor in being more natural in performance.&lt;ref name=actor/&gt;

According to Alexander Technique instructor [[Michael J. Gelb]], people tend to study the Alexander Technique for reasons of personal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gelb|first=Michael J.|title=Body learning : an introduction to the Alexander Technique|year=1995|publisher=Holt|location=New York|isbn=0805042067|pages=3–4|edition=2nd Owl Book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

The Alexander Technique is most commonly taught privately in a series of 10 to 40 private lessons which may last from 30 minutes to an hour. Students are often performers, such as actors, dancers, musicians, athletes and public speakers, people who work on computers, or  those who are in frequent pain for other reasons. Instructors observe their students, then show them how to move with better poise and less strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodenburg|first=Kelly McEvenue |chapter= Foreword by Patsy|title=The actor and the Alexander Technique|year=2002|publisher=Palgrave, Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0312295154|pages=3|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sessions include chair work - often in front of a mirror, during which the instructor and the student will stand, sit and lie down, moving efficiently while maintaining a comfortable relationship between the head, neck and spine, and table work or physical manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jain,|first=Sanjiv|author2=Kristy Janssen |author3= Sharon DeCelle|journal=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America|year=2004|volume=15|pages=811–825|doi=10.1016/j.pmr.2004.04.005|pmid=15458754|title=Alexander Technique and Feldenkrais method: A critical overview|issue=4|citeseerx=10.1.1.611.4183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify as a teacher of Alexander Technique, instructors are required to complete 1,600 hours, spanning three years, of supervised teacher training. The result must be satisfactory to qualified peers to gain membership in professional societies.&lt;ref name="Arnold 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Little&gt;{{cite journal|last=Little|first=P.|author2=Lewith, G.|author3= Webley, F. |author4=Evans, M. |author5=Beattie, A. |author6=Middleton, K. |author7=Barnett, J. |author8=Ballard, K. |author9=Oxford, F. |author10=Smith, P. |author11=Yardley, L. |author12=Hollinghurst, S. |author13=Sharp, D.|title=Randomised controlled trial of Alexander Technique lessons, exercise, and massage (ATEAM) for chronic and recurrent back pain|journal=BMJ|date=19 August 2008|volume=337|issue=aug19 2|pages=a884–a884|doi=10.1136/bmj.a884|pmid=18713809|pmc=3272681|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a884.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==
Some advocates for the Alexander technique have claimed it can help people with many kinds of health conditions.&lt;ref name="NHS" /&gt;

One example is a claim that it can benefit people with [[asthma]]. A 2012 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] [[systematic review]] found that there is no conclusive evidence that the Alexander technique is effective for treating asthma, and randomized clinical trials are needed in order to assess the effectiveness of this type of treatment approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Cates|first2=CJ|date=12 September 2012|title=Alexander technique for chronic asthma.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=9|pages=CD000995|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000995.pub2|pmid=22972048|last1=Dennis|first1=JA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review by [[Aetna]] last updated in 2016 stated: "Aetna considers the following alternative medicine interventions experimental and investigational, because there is inadequate evidence in the peer-reviewed published medical literature of their effectiveness." Included is Alexander technique in that list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine - Number 0388|url=http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/300_399/0388.html|publisher=Aetna|accessdate=19 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919012537/http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/300_399/0388.html|archivedate=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review published in 2015 and conducted for the Australia Department of Health in order to determine what services the Australian government should pay for, reviewed clinical trials published to date and found that: "Overall, the evidence was limited by the small number of participants in the intervention arms, wide confidence intervals or a lack of replication of results."   It concluded that: "The Alexander technique may improve short-term pain and disability in people with low back pain, but the longer-term effects remain uncertain. For all other clinical conditions, the effectiveness of Alexander technique was deemed to be uncertain, due to insufficient evidence."  It also noted that: "Evidence for the safety of
Alexander technique was lacking, with most trials not reporting on this outcome.&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S. Australian review finds no benefit to 17 natural therapies. Science-Based Medicine |lay-date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently in 2017 the Australian government named the Alexander Technique as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would "ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence".&lt;ref name=nosubsidy&gt;{{cite web |title=Homeopathy, naturopathy struck off private insurance list |author=Paola S |date=17 October 2017 |journal=Australian Journal of Pharmacy |url=https://ajp.com.au/news/homeopathy-naturopathy-struck-off-private-insurance-list/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of evidence for Alexander Technique for various health conditions provided by UK [[National Health Service (England)#Internet information service|NHS Choices]] last updated in July 2015 found that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There's evidence suggesting the Alexander technique can help people with:
* long-term back pain – lessons in the technique may lead to reduced back pain-associated disability and reduce how often you feel pain for up to a year or more
* long-term neck pain – lessons in the technique may lead to reduced neck pain and associated disability for up to a year or more
* Parkinson's disease – lessons in the technique may help you carry out everyday tasks more easily and improve how you feel about your condition&lt;ref name="NHS" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''NHS Choices'' also states that "some research has also suggested the Alexander technique may improve general long-term pain, stammering and balance skills in elderly people to help them avoid falls. But the evidence in these areas is limited and more studies are needed.  There's currently little evidence to suggest the Alexander technique can help improve other health conditions, including asthma, headaches, osteoarthritis, difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and stress."&lt;ref name="NHS" /&gt;

A review published in ''[[BioMed Central#Journals|BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]'' in 2014 focused on "the evidence for the effectiveness of AT sessions on musicians' performance, anxiety, respiratory function and posture" concluded that: "Evidence from RCTs and CTs suggests that AT sessions may improve performance anxiety in musicians. Effects on music performance, respiratory function and posture yet remain inconclusive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=SD|last2=Bayard|first2=C|last3=Wolf|first3=U|title=The Alexander Technique and musicians: a systematic review of controlled trials.|journal=BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine|date=24 October 2014|volume=14|pages=414|pmid=25344325|pmc=4287507|doi=10.1186/1472-6882-14-414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review published in the ''[[International Journal of Clinical Practice]]'' in 2012 found: "Strong evidence exists for the effectiveness of Alexander Technique lessons for chronic back pain and moderate evidence in Parkinson’s-associated disability. Preliminary evidence suggests that Alexander Technique lessons may lead to improvements in balance skills in the elderly, in general chronic pain, posture, respiratory function and stuttering, but there is insufficient evidence to support recommendations in these areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=J.

== Background of the verse ==
There are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original, and all vary to some extent.&lt;ref name="arabic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamawakened.com/|title=Main Menu|website=Islam Awakened|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslims, such as [[Islamic feminism|Islamic feminist]] groups, argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for [[Islam and domestic violence|domestic violence]].&lt;ref name="issue" /&gt;

In the Prophet's [[Farewell Sermon|farewell sermon]] as recorded in al-Tabari's History,&lt;ref&gt;al-Tabari, ''History of Al-Tabari, Vol. IX: The Last Years of the Prophet'' tr. Poonawala, I.K. (Albany, NY, 1990) pp. 112-113&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly in a ''hadith'' collected by Abu Dawud,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunnah.com/abudawud/11/185 sunnah.com] Sunan Abu Dawud 10:1900&lt;/ref&gt; he instructed husbands to beat their wives, but not severely (فَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ ضَرْبًا غَيْرَ مُبَرِّحٍ ''fadribuhunna darban ghayra mubarrih''; literal translation: "beat them, a beating without severity") if their wives commit an immorality or adultery in the husband's absence; according to the cited farewell address sermon in al-Tabari's history, for a wife to allow someone a husband dislikes to "tread" on his bed means to commit sexual indecencies in the absence of the husband. This is obtained not only from the context of the sermon and the hadith cited, but also from the cited Cliff Note 772 in Vol. IX of Al-Tabari's history. Ibn 'Abbas, a companion of the Prophet, is recorded in the Tafsir of al-Tabari for verse 4:34 as saying that beating without severity is using a ''[[siwak]]'' (small tooth cleaning twig) or a similar object.&lt;ref&gt;Tafseer al-Tabari for 4:34 [http://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&amp;tTafsirNo=1&amp;tSoraNo=4&amp;tAyahNo=34&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&amp;LanguageId=1 al-tafsir.com]&lt;/ref&gt; There are sources that say that [[Muhammad]] himself never hit a woman and forbade it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.systemoflife.com/dawah/character-of-prophet/330-ther-mercy-of-prophet-pbuh-on-women-|title=The Mercy of Prophet PBUH on Women|author=Created on Monday, 08 August 2011 22:48|date=2011-08-08|publisher=Systemoflife.com|accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a hadith collected by Abu Dawud, Muhammad told men not to hit their wives on the face.&lt;ref&gt;Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2137 cited in Philips, A.A.B. &amp; Jones, J.

Another hadith narration of the Farewell Sermon appears in Sunan Ibn Majah. The Arabic phrase mentioned above is here translated, "hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark."

{{Quote|'''It was narrated that:''' Sulaiman bin Amr bin Ahwas said: “My father told me that he was present at the Farewell Pilgrimage with the Messenger of Allah. He praised and glorified Allah, and reminded and exhorted (the people). Then he said: 'I enjoin good treatment of women, for they are prisoners with you, and you have no right to treat them otherwise, unless they commit clear indecency. If they do that, then forsake them in their beds and hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark. If they obey you, then do not seek means of annoyance against them. You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they are not to allow anyone whom you dislike to tread on your bedding (furniture), nor allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses.

However, these scholars highlight that the Qur'an can be interpreted differently as society changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Qur'an and Woman|last1=Wadud|first1=Amina|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Veil and the Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Women's Rights in Islam|last1=Mernissi|first1=Fatimea|date=1991|publisher=Perseus Books|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|last1=Chaudhry|first1=Ayesha|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan A.C. Brown]] gives the wider scholarly tendency when it comes to the verse:

{{Quote|The vast majority of the ulama across the Sunni schools of law inherited the Prophet's unease over domestic violence and placed further restrictions on the evident meaning of the 'Wife Beating Verse'. A leading Meccan scholar from the second generation of Muslims, [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|Ata' bin Abi Rabah]], counseled a husband not to beat his wife even if she ignored him but rather to express his anger in some other way. [[Al-Darimi|Darimi]], a teacher of both [[Tirmidhi]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim bin Hajjaj]] as well as a leading early scholar in Iran, collected all the Hadiths showing Muhammad's disapproval of beating in a chapter entitled 'The Prohibition on Striking Women'. A thirteenth-century scholar from Granada, Ibn Faras, notes that one camp of ulama had staked out a stance forbidding striking a wife altogether, declaring it contrary to the Prophet's example and denying the authenticity of any Hadiths that seemed to permit beating. Even [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]], the pillar of late medieval Sunni Hadith scholarship, concludes that, contrary to what seems to be an explicit command in the Qur'an, the Hadiths of the Prophet leave no doubt that striking one's wife to discipline her actually falls under the Shariah ruling of 'strongly disliked' or 'disliked verging on prohibited'.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C. Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy'', [[Oneworld Publications]] (2014), pp. 275-276&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first part of the verse about men having authority over women is meant for obedience towards [[God in Islam|God]], not the husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_251_300/does_the_quran_allow_beating_of.htm|title=DOES THE QUR'AN ALLOW BEATING OF WOMEN?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.irfi.org|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background on the roles of men and women in Islam===
{{Main article|Gender roles in Islam|Women in Islam}}
The Qur'an states that men are the guardians of women, and thus responsible for earning livelihood for the family and female relatives. Women, however, are given a degree of autonomy over their own income and property, provided this autonomy is exercised in a way that is agreeable to the wishes of the husband, provided his wishes not be in violation of Islamic principles.&lt;ref name="hash"&gt;Iman Hashim, ''Reconciling Islam and feminism'', Gender &amp; Development, 1999, vol. 7, issue 1, p 7, {{ISSN|1355-2074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they are responsible for educating the children, as God has given the one preference over the other. Man is also considered to be the head of the family.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amin Ahsan Islahi]], [[Tadabbur-i-Qur'an]], 2nd ed., vol. 2, (Lahore: Faran Foundation, 1986), p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an recommends that wives be obedient and adaptable to their husbands. Wives should also keep the secrets of their husbands and protect their honor and integrity. Islamic scholars consider this important in running a smooth family system.&lt;ref name="jsoc"&gt;[[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]], ''[[Mizan]]'', Chapter:The Social Law of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what Allah Hath created in their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights similar to the rights against them, according to what is equitable; but men have a degree (of advantage) over them. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise. (Qu'ran 2:228)&lt;ref name=versemen&gt;{{cite web|title=al-Baqarah 2:228|url=http://www.islamawakened.com/quran/2/228/default.htm|website=Islam Awakened|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For both men and women, ''zulm''- known in English as actions of 'cruelty' against someone- is explicitly prohibited.&lt;ref name=issue/&gt;

====Equality of genders throughout the Qur'an====
The equality of men and women is discussed in many places throughout the text. The Quran blamed Adam and Eve for the original sin as Satan talks to both of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~msaiupui/statuswomen.html|title=Status of Women in Islam|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iupui.edu|publisher=[[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922031909/http://www.iupui.edu/~msaiupui/statuswomen.html|archive-date=2018-09-22|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an is also very specific that both men and women should receive equal punishment for wrongdoings (24:2), and that both men and women are seen as equals under God, and will be rewarded for their faith by entering Heaven (4:124).

{{Quote|text=The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes(Qur’an 24:2)&lt;ref name=verse2&gt;{{cite web|title=An-nur 24:2|url=http://islamawakened.com/quran/24/2/default.htm|website=Islam Awakened|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Male and female relationships in the times of the Prophet====

In her book ''Qur'an and Women'', scholar [[Amina Wadud]] writes about the importance of women in the time of the Prophet.  During this time, women did not have access to the technology that women today have; giving birth and raising children was much more difficult due to diseases and lack of healthcare knowledge.  For this reason, Wadud writes, "The Qur'an establishes his [the husband's] responsibility as ''qiwamah'': seeing to it that the women is not burdened with additional responsibilities which jeopardize that primary demanding responsibility only she can fulfill." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wadud|first1=Amina|title=Qur'an and Woman|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need to reproduce and raise children contributed to the importance of gender roles in the time of the Prophet.

Scholar [[Ayesha Chaudhry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-next-frontier-for-muslim-women-finding-their-sovereignty-in/|title=The next frontier for Muslim women: Finding their sovereignty in religion|last=|first=|date=|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date=2018-09-22|quote=Contemporary female Muslim scholars – such as Ayesha Chaudhry, Amina Wadud, Asma Barlas, Ziba Mir-Hosseini and Asma Lamrabet...}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that many Muslims have this fundamentally flawed way of examining the text, writing that "Despite the potential for such verses [4:34] to have multiple plain-sense meanings, living Muslim communities place these interpretations in conversation with the pre-colonial Islamic tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaudhry|first1=Ayesha|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples from the Prophet====
The late [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei|Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Hussein Tabataba'i]] (1903-1981 AD) provides the following exegesis on 4:34 from both [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'ite]] sources in his [[Mizan]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Ibn Abi Hatim has narrated through Ash’ath ibn ‘Abdil-Malik from [[al-Hasan]] that he said: “A woman came to the Prophet complaining against her husband that he had slapped her. The Messenger of Allah said: “Retribution”. Then Allah revealed the verse, “Men are maintainers of women… (4:34); so the woman returned without retribution [ad-Durr 'l-munthur, as-Suyuti]. [as-Suyuti] has narrated it from the Prophet through other chains too.  Some of them say that the Messenger of Allah said: “I wanted one thing (retribution), but Allah decided otherwise"...there were some instances where Allah had amended some prophetic orders by adding to or deleting from it, but it was only in his administrative order, not in matters of the law ordained by him for his people, otherwise it would have been an invalid nullification...the Messenger of Allah used to wonder aloud: "How can you embrace the woman with a hand you had hit her with?".  It is narrated also in [[al-Kafi]] through his chain from Abu Maryam from Abu Ja’far (Imam [[Muhammad al-Baqir]]) that he said: “The Messenger of Allah said: “What! Does one of you hit his wife, and then attempt to embrace her?".  Countless such statements are found in the traditions; and one may understand from them the Islamic views on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;Tafsir al-Mizan, by al-Allamah as-Sayyid Muhammad Husayn at-Tabataba-i, translated by Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi. V. 8, p.217,220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Al-Tabari]] (839-923 AD) wrote that, "The Prophet never raised his hand against one of his wives, or against a slave, nor against any person at all." In fact, when the Prophet faced rebellion of his wives, rather than beat him, Al-Tabari accounts that he instead, "stayed away from his wives for 29 nights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mernissi|first1=Fatimea|title=The Veil and the Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Women's Rights in Islam|date=1991|publisher=Perseus Books|location=Cambridge|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates and discussion about the text==
In response to ''nushûz'', admonishment, leaving wives in their beds and ''idribihunna'' are permitted. Islamic scholars agree such actions can not be undertaken for any reason other than those mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] (see [[An-Nisa, 34#Interpretation of the word "nushûz"|''nushûz'']]).&lt;ref&gt;Saleem Shahzad, ''[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novtitl2y1.html Can a Husband force his Wife to wear the Hijab?]'', [[Al-Mawrid|Renaissance - Monthly Islamic Journal]], 11(11), November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 1: Authority of men and its reasons===
This allots men authority over women due to following reasons:
1: Because God has given some more strength than others.
2: Because men spent from their property to support women i.e., 
clothing, residence, and sustenance.The word ''qawwamun''  is also used at Al-Quran 4:134. Here it is said that believers should be Qawwamun with fairness.

====1: God has favoured some over others====
One of the reason men being ''qawwamun'' over women is that God has favoured some over others.{{Original research inline|date=September 2018}}

====2: Men are responsible of maintenance of women====
Second reason of men being ''qawwamun'' over women is that because men are responsible of earning for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://insideislam.wisc.edu/2010/09/controlling-women-is-not-part-of-islam/|title=Controlling women is not part of Islam|last=|first=|date=2010-09-22|work=Inside Islam|access-date=2018-09-22|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 2: Characters of pious women===
The verse declares that pious women are:
1: Obedient
2: Guarding the unseen as God prescribes.{{Original research inline|date=September 2018}}

====1: Obedient or ''Qanitat''====
The verse commands women to be ''qanitat''. The term has been used in {{Cite Quran|33|35|s=ns}} to refer to men and women alike, who are obedient to God. Some commentators use the term to mean obedience to the husband, while others assert that it means obedience to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wadud|first1=Amina|title=Qur'an and Women|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some "scholars" agree that the husband does not have absolute control over his wife, and her first loyalty is to God.&lt;ref name = Kecia&gt;{{Cite book

====2: Guarding the unseen====
''Hafizat'' is derived from ''hafaz'' meaning to guard. The subjective form is ''hafiz'' meaning a person who guards and ''hafizah'' meaning she who guards (feminine). ''Hafizat'' is plural of ''hafizah'' (both being feminine).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} It means that good women guard themselves in the absence of Husband as God prescribes.{{Original research inline|date=September 2018}}

===Part 3: Rebellious women and advice===
And those whose rebellion (''nushûz'') is feared. It is advised
1: to admonish them
2: to leave them alone in beds
3: to beat them

* the term "''nushûz''" (نُشُوز) is translated as "disloyalty and ill-conduct" by Yusuf Ali, "rebellion" by [[Marmaduke Pickthall|Pickthall]] and "desertion" by [[M. H. Shakir|Shakir]]. Other scholars{{Who|date=September 2018}} have drawn on hadiths{{Which|date=September 2018}} to interpret the meaning of the word.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

====1: to admonish them ====
The first response to ''nushuz'' is ''wā'z'' (‘وَعَظ’), meaning to first admonish or scold the wife of her behaviour.&lt;ref name="jsoc"/&gt; There is strong agreement amongst Muslim scholars that this admonishment must be conducted in a spirit of reconciliation.&lt;ref name="Ammar" /&gt;

====2: to leave them alone in beds ====

According to tafsir ibn kathir, a well known commentary of Quran. He describes in his exegesis.

{{quote|The Sunan and Musnad compilers recorded that Mu`awiyah bin Haydah Al-Qushayri said, "O Allah's Messenger! What is the right that the wife of one of us has on him'' The Prophet saido feed her when you eat, cloth her when you buy clothes for yourself, refrain from striking her face or cursing her, and to not abandon her, except in the house.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=672&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Should the ''nushuz'' continue, the next step is to refuse to share the bed with the wife. Again Muslim scholars emphasize on the spirit of healing while conducting this action.&lt;ref name="Ammar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ammar|first=Nawal H.|date=May 2007|title=Wife Battery in Islam: A Comprehensive Understanding of Interpretations|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077801207300658|journal=Violence Against Women|volume=13|issue=5|pages=519–523|doi=10.1177/1077801207300658|pmid=17478676|via=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====3:  to beat them (''iḍribūhunna'' and ''daraba'')====
According to tafsir ibn Kathir.

{{quote|Muslim recorded that Jabir said that during the Farewell Hajj, the Prophet said;
(Fear Allah regarding women, for they are your assistants. You have the right on them that they do not allow any person whom you dislike to step on your mat. However, if they do that, you are allowed to discipline them lightly. They have a right on you that you provide them with their provision and clothes, in a reasonable manner.) Ibn `Abbas and several others said that the Ayah refers to a beating that is not violent. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that it means, a beating that is not severe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=672&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term ''iḍribūhunna'' (usually translated, 'beat them') in 4:34 comes from the root ''ḍaraba'' (Arabic: ضرب).&lt;ref&gt;ضرب defined in Lane, E.W. (1863-93) ''An Arabic English Lexicon'' Reprinted in Beirut: Librarie du Liban, 1968, p.1777 [http://www.studyquran.org/LaneLexicon/Volume5/00000062.pdf View on studyquran.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The word has been used many times in the Quran to mean: to hit, to travel the earth, to set up, to condemn and to give examples. Thus scholars interpret ''iḍribūhunna'' in different ways.

The term ''daraba'' is translated by Yusuf Ali as "beat," but the Arabic word is used elsewhere in the Qur'an to convey different meanings.

Brown]] resumes the situation:&lt;blockquote&gt;If a wife exhibited egregious disobedience (nushuz) such as uncharacteristically insulting behavior, leaving the house against the husband's will and without a valid excuse or denying her husband sex (without medical grounds), the husband should first admonish her to be conscious of God and proper etiquette. If she did not desist from her behavior, he should cease sleeping with her in their bed. If she still continued in her nushuz, he should then strike her to teach her the error of her ways. Shaffii law only allowed the husband to use his hand or a wound-up handkerchief (mina malfuf), not a whip or stick. All schools of law prohibited striking the wife in the face or in any sensitive area likely to cause injury. All except some Maliki jurists held that the wife could claim compensation payment (diya) from the husband for any injury she sustained, and Hanbalis, the later Shaffii school as well as the Maliki school, allowed a judge to dissolve the marriage at no cost to the wife if harm had been done. In effect,  any  physical harm was grounds for compensation and divorce since the Prophet had limited striking one's wife to 'a light blow that leaves no mark.' Causing any injury thus meant that a husband had exceeded his rights. All schools of law agreed that if the wife died due to a beating, her family could claim her wergild or possibly even have the husband executed.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C. Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy'', [[Oneworld Publications]] (2014), pp. 276-277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Many jurists interpret ''iḍribūhunna'' as "more or less symbolic."&lt;ref name="asad"&gt;[[Muhammad Asad]], ''The Message of the Qur'an'' (his translation of the Qur'an).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One such authority is the earliest [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|hafiz]], [[Ibn Abbas]].[http://www.themodernreligion.com/women/w_abuse_badawi.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Others,{{Who|date=September 2018}} however, argue that a mere symbolic administration would be pointless and rather should be an "energetic demonstration" of the love of the husband. But it is agreed that the demonstration should not seriously hurt the wife.&lt;ref name="shaf" /&gt;

The 2007 translation ''[[The Sublime Quran]]'' by Laleh Bakhtiar translates ''iḍribūhunna'' not as 'beat them' but as 'go away from them'. The introduction to her translation discusses the linguistic and shari‘ah reasons in Arabic for understanding this verb in context. The Prophet never beat his wives, and his example from the [[Sunnah]] informs the interpretation of this verse. This interpretation is supported by the fact that some other verses, such as 4:101 which contains word ''darabtum'' (derivation from ''daraba''), demonstrate also the interpretation of Arabic word ''daraba'' to have meaning 'going' or 'moving'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Islamic scholar Tahir-ul-Qadri has given the same translation in his translation of the Quran "''Irfan-ul-Quran''": "(...)and (if they still do not improve) turn away from them, striking a temporary parting.(...)".&lt;ref name="irfan-ul-quran.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Minhaj Internet Bureau |url=http://www.irfan-ul-quran.com/quran/english/contents/sura/cols/0/ar/1/ur/1/ra/1/en/1/sid/4/ |title=an-Nisā’ (Women) |publisher=Irfan-ul-Quran |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This translation is further supported by the fact that the word "''darabtum''" is used in the same chapter (specifically, in {{Cite Quran|4|94|s=ns}}), which means to "go abroad" in the sake of Allah and which is derived from the same root word ("''daraba''") as "''idribuhunna''" in 4:34.&lt;ref name="4:94"&gt;Osama Abdallah. [http://www.islamawareness.net/Wife/beating1.html ''Systematic comparison with 4:94''] Islamawareness.net&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Woman in the Shade of Islam'' by Saudi scholar Abdul Rahman al-Sheha stated that a man may "beat" his wife only if it occurs without "hurting, breaking a bone, leaving blue or black marks on the body and avoiding hitting the face, at any cost."

A widely used 1930 English translation of the Quran by British Muslim scholar Marmaduke Pickthall determined the verse to mean that, as a last resort, men can "scourge" their wives.&lt;ref name=issue/&gt;

Some jurists argue that even when hitting is acceptable under the Qur'an, it is still discountenanced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]] comments that "Whenever the Prophet (peace be on him) permitted a man to administer corporal punishment to his wife, he did so with reluctance, and continued to express his distaste for it. And even in cases where it is necessary, the Prophet (peace be on him) directed men not to hit across the face, nor to beat severely nor to use anything that might leave marks on the body." "Towards Understanding the Qur'an" Translation by Zafar I. Ansari from "Tafheem Al-Qur'an" (specifically, commentary on 4:34) by Syed Abul-A'ala Mawdudi, Islamic Foundation, Leicester, England.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The medieval jurist ash-[[Shafi'i]], founder of one of the main schools of ''[[fiqh]]'', commented on this verse that "hitting is permitted, but not hitting is preferable."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[S]ome of the greatest Muslim scholars (e.g., Ash-Shafi'i) are of the opinion that it is just barely permissible, and should preferably be avoided: and they justify this opinion by the Prophet's personal feelings with regard to this problem." [[Muhammad Asad]], ''The Message of the Qur'an'' (his translation of the Qur'an).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam|No god but God]]'', [[University of Southern California]] scholar [[Reza Aslan]], stated that false interpretations of the text have occurred because Quranic commentary "has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men."&lt;ref name=issue/&gt;

The Islamic prophet Mohammed himself, according to Islamic tradition, never once struck a woman in argument. This fact is sometimes cited in debates about the text.&lt;ref name="issue"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001261.html|title=Clothes Aren't the Issue|last=Nomani|first=Asra Q.|date=October 22, 2006|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922033032/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001261_2.html?noredirect=on|archive-date=2018-09-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nada Ibrahim of the [[University of South Australia]] states that three words—''qawwamuna'', ''nushuzahunna'', and ''wadribuhunna''—are mistranslated due to the lack of equivalent English alternatives. She explains that in particular, English language Qur'an commentators have not agreed to merely one translation of the word ''wadribuhunna'' and that "A clear disagreement exists among English-language Qur’an commentators on how best to translate this word. All translations give an explicit negative connotation, and – when read out of context – further exacerbates any misunderstanding."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theconversation.com/explainer-what-islam-actually-says-about-domestic-violence-77245|title=Explainer: what Islam actually says about domestic violence|last=Ibrahim|first=Nada|date=2017-06-12|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915054520/https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-islam-actually-says-about-domestic-violence-77245|archive-date=2018-09-15|dead-url=no|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part 4: When they obey ===
In quran’s Commentary exegisis of this part of verse is as following:

{{quote|(but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance),) meaning, when the wife obeys her husband in all that Allah has allowed, then no means of annoyance from the husband are allowed against his wife. Therefore, in this case, the husband does not have the right to beat her or shun her bed. Allah's statement,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=671&lt;/ref&gt;}}
==== 1: not to seek ways against them   ====
In this part of verse God says that if women obey then man are not allowed to make excuses against them..

=== Part 5: Glorification of God ===
Ibn Kathir in the commentary of this part of verse says

{{quote|Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great.) reminds men that if they transgress against their wives without justification, then Allah, the Ever Most High, Most Great, is their Protector, and He will exert revenge on those who transgress against their wives and deal with them unjustly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=671&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== 1: Exalted ====
It means that God is exalted.
==== 2: Great ====
It means that God is great.

&lt;!--PLEASE KEEP THIS ARTICLE FACTUAL AND NEUTRAL, NOT TURN IT INTO THE BERSIH 2.0 SUPPORTERS' BLOG.--&gt;
The '''Bersih 2.0 rally''' (also called the '''Walk for Democracy''') was a demonstration in [[Kuala Lumpur]] held on 9 July 2011 as a follow-up to the [[2007 Bersih rally]]. The rally, organised by the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections ([[Bersih]]), was supported by [[Pakatan Rakyat]], the coalition of the three largest opposition parties in Malaysia, but was deemed illegal by the government. Bersih, chaired by former president of the [[Malaysian Bar|Bar Council]] [[Ambiga Sreenevasan]], were pushing the [[Election Commission of Malaysia]] (EC) to ensure free and fair elections in Malaysia. It demanded that the EC clean up the electoral roll, reform postal voting, use indelible ink, introduce a minimum 21-day campaign period, allow all parties free access to the media, and put an end to electoral fraud.

The [[Royal Malaysia Police|police]] vowed to stop any rallies from taking place on the planned date on the grounds that all public gatherings without police permits are illegal. Having originally planned to march through the streets of Kuala Lumpur, Bersih decided to hold its rally at [[Stadium Merdeka|Merdeka Stadium]] after consultations with the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], Malaysia's head of state.

Supporters of Bersih claim that demands for electoral reform made during the 2007 demonstration fell on deaf ears. [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] Youth and [[Perkasa]] planned counter-rallies, dismissing Bersih's demands for electoral reform, but Perkasa called off its counter-rally due to its inability to secure a venue and permit.

Estimates of the turnout ranged between 10,000 and over 20,000. The protestors were unable to congregate at Merdeka Stadium as many were forced to disperse by police who were heavily deployed throughout the city. Police arrested more than 1600 protestors, including [[Ambiga Sreenevasan|Ambiga]] and several opposition figures.

==Background==
The ruling coalition in Malaysia, [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN), which consists of parties representing the major racial groups in Malaysia, has won every federal election since independence in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia set for general election |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7283239.stm |work=BBC News   |date=7 March 2008 |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition parties and civil society organisations have long claimed that BN has been manipulating elections in its favour.&lt;ref name="walk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="polact"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kok"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anwar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aliran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="upper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trans"/&gt;

===Protests in Malaysia===
Street demonstrations are rare in Malaysia, but the public has become more vocal with the rise of alternative media and a resurgent opposition.&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia police lock down capital ahead of protest |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/09/us-malaysia-protest-idUSTRE7680B720110709 |agency=Reuters   |date=9 July 2011 |author1=Niluksi Koswanage |author2=Razak Ahmad |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gatherings in Malaysia of five or more people must receive a police permit, which is rarely granted.&lt;ref name="fingerprint"/&gt; The government has used heavy police presence to block rallies as well as arrest protest leaders to stop illegal public protests.

[[Bersih]], short for the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections ({{lang-ms|Gabungan Pilihanraya '''Bersih''' dan Adil}}), is a coalition of 62 non-governmental organisations founded in November 2006.&lt;ref name="endorsees"&gt;{{cite web |title=Endorsees |url=http://bersih.org/?page_id=360 |publisher=Bersih |accessdate=14 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408101727/http://bersih.org/?page_id=360 |archivedate=8 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |title=About BERSIH |url=http://bersih.org/?page_id=352 |publisher=Bersih |accessdate=21 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622172238/http://bersih.org/?page_id=352 |archivedate=22 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding, Bersih has been supported by the three main opposition parties, [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] (PKR), PAS, and DAP.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; ''Bersih'' is the Malay word for "clean"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bersih |url=http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Search.aspx?k=bersih |work=Dictionary |publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the claims of large scale corruption in the leading party.

The [[2007 Bersih rally|first Bersih rally]] on 10 November 2007 was estimated to have drawn between 30,000 and 50,000 people.&lt;ref name="aje1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Police block Malaysia protest |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2007/12/2008525131234195960.html |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="politicians"/&gt; It was broken up by police using [[tear gas]] and chemical-laced [[water cannon]]s.&lt;ref name="aje1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia police break up protest |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7088877.stm |work=BBC News   |date=10 November 2007 |last=Brant |first=Robin |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally was said to play a major role in helping the opposition parties make big gains in the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 general election]].&lt;ref name="politicians"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asiatimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysian politics take to the streets |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/MF24Ae02.html |work=[[Asia Times Online]] |date=24 June 2011 |last=Netto |first=Anil |accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bersih 2.0, as the organisation branded itself for the 2011 rally, is chaired by former [[Malaysian Bar|Bar Council]] president [[Ambiga Sreenevasan]]. Ambiga served as president of the Bar from 2007 to 2009 and is a recipient of the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]]'s International Women of Courage Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Presidents' Roll |url=http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/past_presidents.html |publisher=Malaysian Bar |accessdate=21 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Remarks by Clinton on International Women of Courage Awards |url=http://www.america.gov/st/texttrans-english/2009/March/20090312132025xjsnommis0.1997949.html&amp;distid=ucs#ixzz1PtAnEl7f |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=11 March 2009 |accessdate=21 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228192528/http://www.america.gov/st/texttrans-english/2009/March/20090312132025xjsnommis0.1997949.html%26distid%3Ducs#ixzz1PtAnEl7f |archive-date=28 February 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demands===
Ambiga has summed up the main issues raised by the organisation she leads as "unhappiness... in the [[Sarawak state election, 2011|Sarawak [election]]], unhappiness about corruption, [and] unhappiness about the independence of our institutions."&lt;ref name="go on"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih rally goes on, says Ambiga, PAS |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-rally-goes-on-says-ambiga-pas/ |last=Boo |first=Su-Lyn |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=12 June 2011 |accessdate=13 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613043850/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-rally-goes-on-says-ambiga-pas |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She said demands made during the first rally in 2007 have not been addressed, hence the follow-up rally.&lt;ref name="politicians"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ambiga asks politicians to join Bersih rally |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ambiga-asks-politicians-to-join-bersih-rally/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=12 June 2011 |last=Boo |first=Su-Lyn |accessdate=13 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613212007/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ambiga-asks-politicians-to-join-bersih-rally/ |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The communiqué issued by Bersih issued in 2007 called for reforms to Malaysia's [[first-past-the-post]] electoral system, ensuring the independence of the [[Election Commission of Malaysia|Election Commission]] (EC), eliminating electoral practices deemed unfair to opposition candidates, eliminating corrupt campaign practices, equal access to the media for all political parties, and instituting a [[caretaker government]] during election periods, among others in the long term.&lt;ref name="comm"&gt;{{cite web |title=Joint Communiqué |url=http://bersih.org/?page_id=115 |publisher=Bersih |date=23 November 2006 (updated July 2007) |accessdate=13 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621011418/http://bersih.org/?page_id=115 |archivedate=21 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After agreeing to abandon plans for a street demonstration, Bersih also called for a [[Royal Commission]] into election practices.&lt;ref name="rci"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih wants supporters freed, RCI on election practices |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-wants-supporters-freed-rci-on-election-practices/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=6 July 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plans===
The rally's original plan was to have protestors gather at the KL Sogo shopping center, [[Kuala Lumpur City Hall]] building, and the [[Kampung Baru Mosque]] before marching to the [[Istana Negara, Jalan Istana|Istana Negara]] to deliver a memorandum to the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]].&lt;ref name="workwith"/&gt; After consultations with the King, Bersih decided to hold the rally in a stadium instead.&lt;ref name="nomarch"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia Street Protests Averted as Group Agrees to Use Stadium |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-05/malaysia-street-protests-averted-as-group-agrees-to-use-stadium.html |publisher=Bloomberg |date=5 July 2011 |last1=Gan |first1=Yen Kuan |last2=Ten Kate |first2=Daniel |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their request to use [[Merdeka Stadium]] was rejected by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police declines Bersih 2.0 permit application to hold rally at Merdeka Stadium |url=http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/PolicedeclinesBersih2_0permitapplicationtoholdrallyatMerdekaStadium/Article/#ixzz1RWMOPfRh |work=[[New Straits Times]] |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bersih accused the government of reneging on a previous offer to let them rally in a stadium instead of the streets.&lt;ref name="nostop"&gt;{{cite news |title=Government cannot stop us, says Bersih |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/government-cannot-stop-us-says-bersih/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=8 July 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bersih insisted on gathering at Merdeka Stadium, despite [[#Lockdown|preventative measures]] taken by police.&lt;ref name="nostop"/&gt;

==Lead-up to the rally==

===Announcement===
After frustration at by being shut out of [[Election monitoring|observing]] the [[Sarawak state election, 2011|April 2011 Sarawak election]], Bersih announced in a press release on 26 May that it had decided to organise a gathering on 9 July to press for electoral reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bersih 2.0: Deportation of activist from Sarawak and announcement of ‘Perhimpunan Rakyat’ |url=http://bersih.org/?p=3844 |publisher=Bersih |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bersih's demands were repeatedly dismissed by the [[Election Commission of Malaysia|Election Commission]] (EC), who sought to tie the organisation to the opposition's agenda.&lt;ref name="ec3"&gt;{{cite news |title=EC: Bersih intends to overthrow govt |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/06/30/ec-bersih-intends-to-overthrow-govt/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=30 June 2011 |last=Sta Maria |first=Stephanie |accessdate=30 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701100814/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/06/30/ec-bersih-intends-to-overthrow-govt/ |archive-date=1 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; EC deputy chairman Wan Ahmad Wan Omar claimed Bersih was working with [[Pakatan Rakyat]] to "overthrow the government."&lt;ref name="ec3"/&gt; In turn, Ambiga criticised the EC's conduct, asking them to remain independent from politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ambiga tells EC to remain neutral |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ambiga-tells-ec-to-remain-neutral/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=30 June 2011 |last=Yow |first=Hong Chieh |accessdate=30 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701182220/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ambiga-tells-ec-to-remain-neutral/ |archive-date=1 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June, the EC extended an offer to Bersih to meet and discuss its demands, on the condition that the rally be called off. He claimed that during a previous meeting with Bersih in 2010, it had agreed that its demands were met.&lt;ref name="ec1"&gt;{{cite news |title=EC offers to meet Bersih if rally called off |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ec-offers-to-meet-bersih-if-rally-called-off/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=20 June 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bersih rejected the EC's offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih 2.0 to EC: Enough talk, now we walk |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/167494 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=20 June 2011 |author=Hafiz Yatim |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to reporters while observing the [[Thai general election, 2011|Thai general election]] in July, Abdul Aziz said the EC was considering allowing international observers to monitor the [[next Malaysian general election]].&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;{{cite news |title=EC Mulls Inviting International Observers |url=http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v5/newsgeneral.php?id=598215 |publisher=[[Bernama]] |author=Jamaluddin Muhammad |date=1 July 2011 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government reaction===
Prime minister [[Najib Razak]] warned that Bersih would be responsible if chaos ensued from the rally.&lt;ref name="najib1"&gt;{{cite news |title=PM: July 9 rally organisers would be held responsible if chaos erupts |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/26/nation/20110626132648&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=26 June 2011 |author=Mazwin Nik Anis |accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home Minister [[Hishamuddin Hussein]] warned against the rally, fearing the chaos that might ensue.&lt;ref name="politicians"/&gt; He affirmed on 7 June that the rally was "illegal," and urged the organisers to call it off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Ban on illegal demo is for safety’ |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/7/nation/8849506&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|''The Star'']] |date=7 June 2011 |accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He promised to clamp down on demonstrators if they threatened national security.&lt;ref name="clean up"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih should clean up its act, says Home Minister |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/5/23/nation/8737547&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|''The Star'']] |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=July 9 rally: No easy walk for Bersih, Perkasa |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/06/15/july-9-rally-no-easy-walk-for-bersih-perkasa/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=15 July 2011 |last=Lee |first=Patrick |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thumbing nose at Hisham, Khairy says march goes on |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/thumbing-nose-at-hisham-khairy-says-march-goes-on/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=17 June 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June, he confirmed that none of the three rallies would receive police permits to hold gatherings on 9 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hishammuddin: No permits for Bersih, Umno Youth and Perkasa |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/22/nation/20110622125323&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=22 June 2011 |author=Mazwin Nik Anis |accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government also outlawed the wearing and distribution of Bersih's yellow shirts and declared Bersih an illegal organisation under Section 5 of the Societies Act 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih T-shirts illegal, declares Hisham |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-t-shirts-illegal-declares-hisham/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=29 June 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih declared unlawful organisation |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/07/02/bersih-declared-unlawful-organisation/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=2 July 2011 |author=Bernama |authorlink=Bernama |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bersih countered that as a coalition of groups it need not be registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih 2.0: Coalitions need not be registered |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/168839 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=4 July 2011 |last=Sipalan |first=Joseph |accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Najib initially offered Bersih the opportunity of holding the rally in a stadium instead of the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pakatan willing to accept Najib’s stadium offer |url=http://my.news.yahoo.com/pakatan-willing-to-accept-najib-s-stadium-offer-043850816.html |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=5 July 2011 |last=Chooi |first=Clara |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government later rejected Bersih's request to hold the rally at [[Merdeka Stadium]], and asked them to use a stadium in [[Selangor]] instead.&lt;ref name="blockroads"&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia to Block Roads in Bid to Stop Protesters Demanding Fair Elections |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-08/malaysia-to-block-roads-in-bid-to-stop-protesters-demanding-fair-elections.html |publisher=Bloomberg |date=8 July 2011 |author1=Manirajan Ramasamy |last2=Gan |first=Yen Kuan |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Sharafuddin of Selangor|Sultan of Selangor]] had previously condemned demonstrations.&lt;ref name="unwavering"&gt;{{cite news |title=Despite obstacles, Bersih remains unwavering |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/169357 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition reaction===
PAS deputy president [[Mohamad Sabu]] gave the rally his party's full backing.&lt;ref name="go on"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih 2.0 diteruskan walau Perkasa halang |url=http://bm.harakahdaily.net/index.php/headline/3766-bersih-20-diteruskan-walau-perkasa-halang |work=Harakah Daily |date=13 June 2011 |author=Nazri Abdullah |accessdate=13 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling the event the "Walk for Democracy," he asked for 300,000 PAS members to attend the gathering.&lt;ref name="walk"/&gt; PAS president [[Abdul Hadi Awang]] ordered all of its members (numbering one million) to join the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PAS on million-man march for Bersih |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/pas-on-million-man-march-for-bersih/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=23 June 2011 |last=Yow |first=Hong Chieh |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Leader of the Opposition, [[Anwar Ibrahim]], will also take part in the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anwar ups the ante on Bersih 2.0 |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/166694 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=12 June 2011 |last=Netto |first=Terence |accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DAP also pledged support for the rally.&lt;ref name="kok"/&gt;

On 5 July, the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] voiced concern about the restriction of freedom of expression in Malaysia and urged the government to release detained Bersih activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Malaysia: UN rights office concerned at reported crackdown ahead of planned protests |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38935&amp;Cr=expression&amp;Cr1 |publisher=UN |date=5 July 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yang di-Pertuan Agong's intervention===
Malaysia's head of state, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], [[Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin]], issued a statement on 3 July urging moderation by all parties. He said "street demonstrations bring more bad than good although the original intention is good," and called for Bersih to resolve its differences with the government peacefully. He also expressed confidence in Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]]'s administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=King issues statement on Bersih 2.0 rally |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/7/3/nation/20110703233907&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=3 July 2011 |author=Bernama |authorlink=Bernama |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==
[[Kuala Lumpur]] was described as a "ghost town" on the morning of 9 July.

("Long live the people!").&lt;ref name="aje2"/&gt; Police responded by firing numerous rounds of [[tear gas]] and chemical-laced water, causing the crowds to disperse into nearby buildings. Police continued to fire tear gas and chemical-laced water at the buildings. Many buildings were targeted by the police including a hospital which the police denied happened even though there are pictures of the water cannons spraying the hospital.&lt;ref name="aje2"/&gt;

At 14:00, Bersih and Pakatan Rakyat leaders began their march towards Merdeka Stadium. Shielded by hundreds of supporters, they pushed past three lines of police personnel awaiting them outside KL Sentral.&lt;ref name="seizeambiga"/&gt; Around 14:30, while walking with supporters in [[Brickfields]], Ambiga and fellow steering committee member Maria Chin Abdullah were arrested.&lt;ref name="seizeambiga"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cops seize Ambiga, Pakatan leaders mid-march |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-leaders-begin-march/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=9 July 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition politicians detained include [[Abdul Hadi Awang]], [[Mohamad Sabu]], [[Salahuddin Ayub]], [[Mahfuz Omar]], [[Dzulkefly Ahmad]], [[Azmin Ali]], [[Tian Chua]], [[Fuziah Salleh]], [[Sivarasa Rasiah]], and [[Ngeh Koo Ham]].&lt;ref name="hurt"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ambiga, Pakatan leaders arrested; Anwar hurt |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/07/09/ambiga-pakatan-leaders-arrested/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=9 July 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anwar Ibrahim]] said he sustained a bruise on his head and a cut leg when police fired live rounds.&lt;ref name="bruisecut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Thousands of Malaysians Rally for Changes to Elections |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/world/asia/10malaysia.html?_r=1 |work=The New York Times |date=9 July 2011 |last=Gooch |first=Liz |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAS MP [[Khalid Samad]] was said to have suffered a serious head injury and was admitted to hospital.&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt;

UMNO Youth's rally in Bukit Bintang however, was allowed to on peacefully without intervention from the police.

Around 1,000 protestors eventually reached Merdeka Stadium, including national laureate [[A.

One death was reported. Protestor Baharuddin Ahmad accidentally inhaled tear gas fired by police. He was later arrested, but when he started to black out police didn't do anything and just stood there and watched.

==Aftermath==
National laureate [[A.

Leader of the Opposition [[Anwar Ibrahim]] said the rally was a "success" despite "police brutality."&lt;ref name="bruisecut"&gt;{{cite news |title=Anwar: I suffered a bruise and a cut leg |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/169433 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=9 July 2011 |author=AFP |authorlink=Agence France Presse |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; DAP secretary-general [[Lim Guan Eng]] said the "police abuse" was "a big blow to the image of Malaysia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Guan Eng: Police abuse at rally bad image for M'sia |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/169454 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=10 July 2011 |last=Loone |first=Susan |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] downplayed the rally, insisting it only represented a minority of the population.&lt;ref name="najibreaction"&gt;{{cite news |title=Najib: Let illegal rally be a lesson to the people |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/7/10/nation/9074694&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=10 July 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said the anti-government sentiment among the protestors confirmed the government's fears that Bersih's agenda had been hijacked by the opposition.&lt;ref name="najibreaction"/&gt; Home Minister [[Hishamuddin Hussein]] praised the police for keeping the rally under control and said the rally revealed itself to be an opposition plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih rally lost direction, says Hishammuddin |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/bersih-rally-lost-direction-says-hishammuddin/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=9 July 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States expressed concern over the crackdown. [[United States Department of State|State Department]] spokesman Mark Toner said "We stand for... the right for people to freely express their democratic aspirations and express their views freely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US concern at Malaysia crackdown on protests |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14149828 |work=BBC News |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International released a statement saying: "This brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters is undermining Malaysia’s claim to be a moderate democracy.

===Reform proposals===
On 15 August 2011, Najib announced that a parliamentary select committee will be formed to examine the electoral system. He said the committee will consist of members of parliament from both the government and opposition coalition who will discuss electoral reform issues "so that a mutual agreement can be reached."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In nod to Bersih, PM announces vote system relook |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/pm-announces-bi-partisan-panel-to-study-vote-system/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=15 August 2011 |author=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal |accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Malaysia Day]] 2011 address in September, Najib announced the government's intentions to repeal the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]], [[Emergency Ordinance]], remove the annual renewal of press and publication permits, and review Section 27 of the [[Police (Malaysia) Act 1967|Police Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PM announces repeal of ISA, three Emergency proclamations |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/9/15/nation/20110915205714&amp;sec=nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101122631/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F9%2F15%2Fnation%2F20110915205714&amp;sec=nation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 January 2012 |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=15 September 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, the government tabled the [[Peaceful Assembly Act]] to replace Section 27 of the Police Act.&lt;ref name="nst1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gathering in peace |url=http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/editorial/gathering-in-peace-1.9695 |work=[[New Straits Times]] |date=23 November 2011 |accessdate=23 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123165426/http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/editorial/gathering-in-peace-1.9695 |archive-date=23 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage and analysis==

===Pre-rally===
The lead-up to the rally has received polarising coverage in Malaysia's print and internet news media. Malaysia's print media are subject to the [[Printing Presses and Publications Act]], which stipulates they can only publish with a license granted by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Ministry of Home Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Malaysia |url=http://pcmlp.socleg.ox.ac.uk/archive/transition/issue07/malaysia.htm |work=Communications Law in Transition Newsletter |publisher=Oxford University, [[Yeshiva University]] |volume=1 |number=7 |date=4 September 2000 |accessdate=21 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724150414/http://pcmlp.socleg.ox.ac.uk/archive/transition/issue07/malaysia.htm |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A news website has alleged that the [[Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission]] instructed radio and television stations to omit coverage of police violence and focus on the damage done by rally participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Govt to media: Black out police violence during rally |url=http://en.harakah.net.my/index.php/berita-utama/3046-govt-to-media-black-out-police-violence-during-rally.html |work=Harakah Daily |date=1 July 2011 |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State news agency [[Bernama]] quoted several political analysts saying that the rally will tarnish Malaysia's image abroad and is a distraction from [[Anwar Ibrahim]]'s ongoing [[Anwar Ibrahim sodomy trials|sodomy trials]]. It claimed the 1998 demonstrations against Anwar's arrest and the 2007 Bersih rally caused "inconvenience to the public and damage to public property, attracting bad publicity from the international media."

====Print media====
''[[Utusan Malaysia]]'', a newspaper owned by the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), a governing party, criticised the rally as "dirty" on a 12 June editorial. In particular, it made reference to Anwar's sodomy trial and sex video allegations, calling him a hypocrite and urging Malaysians to protest against the opposition leader instead. It also warned against disunity among [[Malay people|Malays]], and claimed that the DAP, backed strongly by Chinese constituents, would benefit most from the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Utusan says Bersih dirty, calls for boycott |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/utusan-says-bersih-dirty-calls-for-boycott/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=12 June 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Utusan'' reported that 70 percent of the 1000 who attended the Bersih 2.0 pre-launch on 19 June were non-Malay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=70 peratus bukan Melayu hadir |url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0621&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Dalam_Negeri&amp;pg=dn_06.htm |work=[[Utusan Malaysia]] |date=20 June 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper has also portrayed the rally as anti-Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bukan budaya Islam |url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0701&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Dalam_Negeri&amp;pg=dn_09.htm |work=[[Utusan Malaysia]] |language=Malay |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They quoted pro-UMNO political analysts attacking Ambiga for "angering Muslims and Malays,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Utusan demonises Ambiga ahead of Bersih rally |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/utusan-demonises-ambiga-ahead-of-bersih-rally/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=26 June 2011 |author=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as reported that foreign Christian organisations are funding the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Utusan says foreign Christian funds behind Bersih |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/utusan-says-foreign-christian-funds-behind-bersih/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=27 June 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tay Tian Yan wrote in the ''[[Sin Chew Daily]]'', the highest circulated daily in Malaysia, that the rally is a repeat scenario of the 2007 protest, where the opposition cashed in on public discontent over rising prices and staged the rally to generate momentum ahead of the general election. He also noted that the counter-rally by UMNO Youth is a ploy by BN to mitigate the Bersih rally's momentum, as opposed to suppressing the rally outright, which he said would swing public opinion against BN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Massive mobilisation |url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/59071 |work=[[Sin Chew Daily]] |date=20 June 2011 |last=Tay |first=Tuan Yan |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lim Sue Goan noted the involvement of Pakatan Rakyat and UMNO in opposite rallies, and said the event has grown from becoming a mere march to demand free elections to a political showdown between the government and opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Political struggle |url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/59584 |work=[[Sin Chew Daily]] |date=28 June 2011 |last=Lim |first=Sue Goan |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 22 June editorial, [[The Star (Malaysia)|''The Star'']], owned by the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA), also a governing party, said opposition parties are colluding with the rally's organisers to discredit the authorities in an attempt to gain support ahead of the elections. It accused Bersih of "[creating] cynical distrust in the authorities to give [themselves] and their political ringleaders a psychological advantage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih 2.0 rally is still politics all the same |url=http://thestar.com.my/columnists/story.asp?col=thestarsays&amp;file=/2011/6/22/columnists/thestarsays/8949840&amp;sec=The%20Star%20Says |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=22 June 2011 |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johan Jaaffar, chairman of Media Prima (owned by UMNO), the parent company of the ''[[New Straits Times]]'', wrote in the paper: "The government of the day is not perfect.

M Faqih, writing in the PAS organ ''Harakah Daily'', compared the planned rally to the September 1998 protests in Kuala Lumpur against then-deputy prime minister [[Anwar Ibrahim]]'s sacking and detention on sodomy and corruption charges, which he described as peaceful unlike the [[Tunisian revolution|revolutions in Tunisia]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]]. He called on the opposition to seize the initiative with public discontent over government policies and use the rally as a stepping stone to victory in next general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=9 Julai penentu akhir tarikh PRU 13 |url=http://bm.harakahdaily.net/index.php/articles/analysis-a-opinion/3879-9-julai-penentu-akhir-tarikh-pru-13- |work=Harakah Daily |author=M Faqih |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internet news====
Josh Hong of ''[[Malaysiakini]]'' questioned the law requiring protest organisers to obtain permits, saying the freedom of speech and right to assembly are guaranteed by the Constitution. He also criticised the government's record of cracking down civil rights campaigners and political activists and the mainstream media's demonisation of the Bersih rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Najib is losing the plot&amp;nbsp;– again |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/columns/169311 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=8 July 2011 |last=Hong |first=Josh |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow columnists Mariam Mokhtar and Dean Johns criticised the government's crackdown on Bersih.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The follies of Umno and the EC |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/columns/168837 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=4 July 2011 |author=Mariam Mokhtar |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Let them eat dirt' |url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/columns/169047 |work=[[Malaysiakini]] |date=5 July 2011 |last=Johns |first=Dean |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News website ''[[The Malaysian Insider]]'' called the government's tough stand against the Bersih rally "double standards," deriding the government's non-action against Ibrahim Ali, who had earlier called for [[jihad]] against Christians. It also blamed the police for the chaos that occurred during the 2007 rally and dismissed the government's concern for national security and threat to tourism as self-caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Putrajaya’s double standards&amp;nbsp;– The Malaysian Insider |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/sideviews/article/putrajayas-double-standards-the-malaysian-insider/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=13 June 2011 |accessdate=21 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The website reported analysts saying the rally will help PAS cement the growing support the party has gained among the Malay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For PAS, Bersih rally catalyst to lead Malay vote |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/for-pas-bersih-rally-catalyst-to-lead-malay-vote/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=27 June 2011 |author=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Free Malaysia Today'', another news website, argued in favour of the rally, saying that concerns that it will serve as a "spring offensive" to overthrow the government are exaggerated. It lamented what it perceived as Malaysia's flawed democracy, saying "[there] are two ways to punish political perverts who have raped democracy: vote them out or take to the streets." It also criticised the government for threatening to clamp down on protestors, saying that the ruling coalition is using public order as an excuse to preserve its stay in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Don’t walk away from democracy |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/06/21/dont-walk-away-from-democracy/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=21 June 2011 |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another editorial the day before the rally, FMT was highly critical of the government, asking the people to "decide the course of history" and defy a "harsh and repressive" state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=People, the choice is yours |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/07/08/people-the-choice-is-yours/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====International====
In an op-ed for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', former US ambassador to Malaysia John R. Malott said Najib's UMNO is "running scared" of losing power and is waging a campaign of intimidation against Bersih. He called the protest "a brave step" towards the country's transition to full democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Running Scared in Malaysia |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303544604576431443001815406?mod=googlenews_wsj |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=8 July 2011 |last=Malott |first=John R. |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Clive Kessler of the University of New South Wales in an interview with ABC Radio stated that the Agong's intervention was a rebuke to Umno and the government and an acknowledgement of Bersih’s legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/07/06/a-royal-rebuke-for-umno-says-aussie-don/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710134614/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/07/06/a-royal-rebuke-for-umno-says-aussie-don/ |archive-date=10 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers owned by Barisan Nasional parties were highly critical of the rally, accusing Bersih of disturbing the peace.&lt;ref name="printattack"&gt;{{cite news |title=Print media attacks Bersih, praises cops |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/print-media-attacks-bersih-praises-cops/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=10 July 2011 |last=Teoh |first=Shannon |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Utusan Malaysia]]'' called the police operation to foil the illegal rally a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Polis berjaya kekang Bersih |url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0710&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Muka_Hadapan&amp;pg=mh_01.htm |work=[[Utusan Malaysia]] |date=9 July 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011 |language=Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Star (Malaysia)|''The Star'']] remarked in an editorial the following day: "If every complaint made one or the other party take to the streets, bringing a city to a standstill, people would not be getting much work done."

''[[The Malaysian Insider]]''{{'}}s Debra Chong said Najib's administration "took a massive punch to its gut," as accounts of police personnel using tear gas and water cannons against unarmed civilians were reported by international media.

Ibrahim Suffian, head of the Merdeka Center, an independent think tank, said the actions of Bersih and the government polarised Malaysians of opposite political opinions. "For Pakatan Rakyat supporters, it has just increased their scepticism of the [BN-ruled] government. For those who are pro-government, it has hardened their belief that the PR is out to cause trouble."&lt;ref name="mahavera"/&gt; One analyst accused Barisan Nasional of abusing public institutions to protect its power,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BN slammed for ‘feudal politics’ |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/2011/07/10/bn-slammed-for-%E2%80%98feudal-politics%E2%80%99/ |work=Free Malaysia Today |date=10 July 2011 |author=Athi Shankar |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another added that "the police lost more credibility than the protesters."&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt;

International reaction was unanimously critical of the government. The Singapore [[The Straits Times|''Straits Times'']] added that Malaysian society has been polarised by the country’s divisive politics as clearly demonstrated when thousands braved a security lockdown of Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/singapore-daily-says-najib-umno-badly-bruised-by-bersih-crackdown/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713143524/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/singapore-daily-says-najib-umno-badly-bruised-by-bersih-crackdown/ |archive-date=13 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial, the [[The Jakarta Post|''Jakarta Post'']] described Malaysia as a "rich but not free" country, with its leaders still "laboring under an old paradigm" and refusing to allow its people to exercise their rights to free speech by invoking racial tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/07/11/editorial-malaysia-rich-not-free.html|title=Malaysia: Rich, but not free|date=11 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Jazeera English]]'s [[Teymoor Nabili]] said the government acted out of fear of an Egypt-style revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malaysia's fear of Egypt |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/asia/2011/07/08/malaysias-fear-egypt |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=9 July 2011 |last=Nabili |first=Teymoor |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] columnist William Pesek calls the rally a part of the "rising call for political change in Asia" that play a decisive role in foreign investment to Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-12/investing-101-means-looking-out-the-windows-more-william-pesek.html|last=Pesek|first=William|title=Investing 101 Means Looking Out the Windows More|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=14 July 2011|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Asian Sentinel stated that although Najib Tun Razak appears to have won the battle by closing down Kuala Lumpur on Saturday and arresting 1,667 mostly peaceful marchers and would-be marchers, the consensus seems to be that Malaysia has suffered a blow to its international reputation as a moderate, democratic country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3307&amp;Itemid=251&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Simon Tisdall slammed Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's harsh treatment towards the peaceful rally participants, noting that the British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] should tell Najib that "strong-arm tactics against protesters are unacceptable" and that "Malaysia's leaders should wake up and smell the coffee".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/13/malaysia-najib-cameron-protesters Malaysia's Najib must abandon the Mubarak model]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Election Commission===
The [[Election Commission of Malaysia]] (EC) has dismissed Bersih's claims, saying that it has already met the organisation's demands. EC chairman Abdul Aziz Mohd Yusof, who met with Bersih officials in December 2010, slammed Bersih chairman Ambiga's knowledge of voter registration as "shallow."&lt;ref name="spr"&gt;{{cite news |title=SPR jawab tuntutan 'Bersih' |url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0614&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Rencana&amp;pg=re_01.htm |work=[[Utusan Malaysia]] |author=Zulkifli Jalil |language=Malay |accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abdul Aziz also claimed that Bersih had a political agenda, saying that the opposition parties were propping up the organisation.&lt;ref name="ec1"/&gt; He claimed the opposition were using the EC as a scapegoat for political gain.&lt;ref name="scapegoat"&gt;{{cite news |title=EC tells Bersih: Don’t make EC a scapegoat |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/20/nation/20110620190723&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=20 June 2011 |author=Bernama |authorlink=Bernama |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to demands====
* Responding to Bersih's demand that voter registration be automatic once a citizen reaches voting age, Abdul Aziz said such a proposal would contravene [[:s:Constitution of Malaysia#Article 119|Article 119 (4)]] of the Constitution, which he claims clearly states that registration as a voter can only be done through application by the voter him/herself.&lt;ref name="spr"/&gt; EC deputy chairman Wan Ahmad Wan Omar added that unregistered voters are "indifferent," and will not bother to vote anyway.&lt;ref name="ec2"&gt;{{cite news |title=EC shoots down Bersih’s demands ahead of rally |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ec-shoots-down-bersihs-demands-ahead-of-rally/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=30 June 2011 |author=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Abdul Aziz also defended against allegations that the EC is lackadaisical in tackling [[Ghost voter|phantom voting]]. He said that the EC cannot strike names of dead voters off the electoral roll unless the family of a dead voter requests it and produces the dead voter's death certificate.&lt;ref name="spr"/&gt; He also blamed allegations of voting in multiple constituencies on voters who refuse to change the addresses on their identification cards when they move homes.&lt;ref name="spr"/&gt;
* Wan Ahmad said the use of [[indelible ink]] is "regressive" and only practised in less developed countries. He also raised the possibility of voters not wanting their fingers inked and voters who somehow inked their fingers before voting.&lt;ref name="ec2"/&gt; Abdul Aziz said the EC was considering a [[biometric]] [[fingerprint]]ing system instead.&lt;ref name="fingerprint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt;
* Wan Ahmad said a 21-day campaign period is "unnecessary" as Malaysia has a relatively small land area and population.&lt;ref name="ec2"/&gt;

===Government===
The rally has been roundly criticised by government politicians, who claim that the opposition are using the rally, purportedly a non-partisan protest, to advance its own political agenda.&lt;ref name="muhyiddin1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Muhyiddin says opposition using Bersih rally to topple BN |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/muhyiddin-says-opposition-using-bersih-rally-to-topple-bn/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=18 June 2011 |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bersih Assembly Only to Serve the Political Agenda of Opposition Parties |url=http://my.news.yahoo.com/bersih-assembly-only-serve-political-agenda-opposition-parties-063824776.html |work=[[Yahoo!

UMNO's information chief [[Ahmad Maslan]] said that the event might risk damaging the economy and national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Umno against Bersih 2.0, says info chief |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/umno-against-bersih-2.0-says-info-chief/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; UMNO Youth leader Khairy Jamaluddin said Anwar's attempts to exert influence over the rally on 19 June was proof that Bersih was "compromised" by the opposition.&lt;ref name="compromised"/&gt; UMNO Youth executive council member Tengku Azman Tengku Zainol Abidin said public rallies should not be held on the streets and that the 2007 Bersih rally "achieved nothing."&lt;ref name="polrpt"/&gt;

Anwar's former political secretary [[Dewan Negara|Senator]] Ezam Mohd Noor called Anwar a hypocrite, saying that Anwar's own PKR party election in 2010 was rife with allegations of manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Khairy: ‘Stock up’ statement a threat to Chinese community |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/21/nation/8941713&amp;sec=nation |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=21 June 2011 |accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perkasa===

==History and significance==
{{Life timeline}}
{{main|Evolutionary history of life}}
The seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the "Primordial Strata" was noted by [[William Buckland]] in the 1840s,&lt;ref name="Buckland1841"&gt;{{cite book| author=Buckland, W. |authorlink=William Buckland| year=1841| title=Geology and Mineralogy Considered with Reference to Natural Theology| publisher=Lea &amp; Blanchard| isbn=1-147-86894-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] discussed the then inexplicable lack of earlier fossils as one of the main difficulties for his theory of descent with slow modification through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="OriginOfSpecies"&gt;{{cite book| title=On the Origin of Species by Natural Selection| author=Darwin, C| authorlink=Charles Darwin| year=1859| pages=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=324&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 202, 306–308]| publisher=Murray| location=London| isbn=1-60206-144-0| oclc=176630493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-running puzzlement about the appearance of the Cambrian [[fauna]], seemingly abruptly, without precursor, centers on three key points: whether there really was a mass diversification of complex organisms over a relatively short period of time during the early Cambrian; what might have caused such rapid change; and what it would imply about the origin of animal life. Interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence, based mainly on an incomplete fossil record and chemical signatures remaining in Cambrian rocks.

The first discovered Cambrian fossils were [[trilobites]], described by [[Edward Lhuyd]], the curator of [[Oxford Museum]], in 1698.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liñán |first1=E.|last2=Gonzalo |first2=R|editor1-last=Rábano |editor1-first=I.|editor2-last=Gozalo|editor2-first=R.|editor3-last=García-Bellido |editor3-first=D.|title=Advances in Trilobite Research|year=2008|publisher=Instituto Geológico y Minero de España |location=Madrid |isbn=978-84-7840-759-0 |page=240 |chapter=Cryptopalaeontology: Magical descriptions of trilobites about two thousand years before scientific references}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their evolutionary importance was not known, on the basis of their old age, William Buckland (1784–1856) realised that a dramatic step-change in the fossil record had occurred around the base of what we now call the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="Buckland1841"/&gt; Nineteenth-century geologists such as [[Adam Sedgwick]] and [[Roderick Murchison]] used the fossils for dating rock strata, specifically for establishing the [[Cambrian]] and [[Silurian]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Mark |title=Fossil Focus: Trilobites |journal=Palaeontology Online |year=2013 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=1–9 |url=http://www.palaeontologyonline.com/articles/2013/fossil-focus-trilobites/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1859, leading geologists including Roderick Murchison, were convinced that what was then called the lowest Silurian stratum showed the origin of life on Earth, though others, including [[Charles Lyell]], differed. In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] considered this sudden appearance of a solitary group of trilobites, with no apparent antecedents, and absence of other fossils, to be "undoubtedly of the gravest nature" among the difficulties in his theory of natural selection. He reasoned that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but that their fossils had not been found due to the imperfections of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="OriginOfSpecies"/&gt; In the sixth edition of his book, he stressed his problem further as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles R. |title=The origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection |date=1876 |page=286 |edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To the question why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits belonging to these assumed earliest periods prior to the Cambrian system, I can give no satisfactory answer.}}

American paleontologist [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]], who studied the [[Fossils of the Burgess Shale|Burgess Shale fauna]], proposed that an interval of time, the "Lipalian", was not represented in the fossil record or did not preserve fossils, and that the ancestors of the Cambrian animals evolved during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Charles Doolittle Walcott | title=Cambrian Geology and Paleontology |journal=Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections |volume=57 |page=14 |author=Walcott, C.D. |year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier fossil evidence has since been found. The earliest claim is that the history of life on earth goes back {{Ma|3850|million years}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Heinrich D. Holland |title=Evidence for life on earth more than 3850 million years ago |journal=Science |author=Holland, Heinrich D |date= January 3, 1997 |doi=10.1126/science.275.5296.38 |volume=275 |pmid=11536783 |issue=5296 |pages=38–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocks of that age at [[Warrawoona, Australia]], were claimed to contain fossil [[stromatolite]]s, stubby pillars formed by colonies of [[microorganism]]s. Fossils (''[[Grypania]]'') of more complex [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, from which all animals, plants, and fungi are built, have been found in rocks from {{Ma|1400}}, in [[China]] and [[Montana]]. Rocks dating from {{Ma|580|543}} contain fossils of the [[Ediacara biota]], organisms so large that they are likely multicelled, but very unlike any modern organism.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt; In 1948, [[Preston Cloud]] argued that a period of "eruptive" evolution occurred in the Early Cambrian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Cloud, P.E. | year=1948 |title=Some problems and patterns of evolution exemplified by fossil invertebrates | journal=Evolution | volume=2 | issue=4 | pages=322–350 | doi=10.2307/2405523 | pmid=18122310 | jstor=2405523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but as recently as the 1970s, no sign was seen of how the 'relatively' modern-looking organisms of the Middle and Late [[Cambrian]] arose.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt;

[[File:Opabinia BW2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Opabinia]]'' made the largest single contribution to modern interest in the Cambrian explosion.]]

The intense modern interest in this "Cambrian explosion" was sparked by the work of [[Harry B. Whittington]] and colleagues, who, in the 1970s, reanalysed many fossils from the Burgess Shale and concluded that several were as complex as, but different from, any living animals.&lt;ref name="Whittington1979Lawn"&gt;Whittington, H. B. (1979). Early arthropods, their appendages and relationships. In M. R. House (Ed.), The origin of major invertebrate groups (pp. 253–268). The Systematics Association Special Volume, 12. London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whittington1985BurgessShale"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Burgess Shale | author=Whittington, H.B. | authorlink=Harry B. Whittington |author2=Geological Survey of Canada | year=1985 | publisher=Yale University Press | isbn=0-660-11901-3 | oclc=15630217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common organism, ''[[Marrella]]'', was clearly an [[arthropod]], but not a member of any known arthropod [[class (biology)|class]]. Organisms such as the five-eyed ''[[Opabinia]]'' and spiny slug-like ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' were so different from anything else known that Whittington's team assumed they must represent different phyla, seemingly unrelated to anything known today. [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s popular 1989 account of this work, ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'',&lt;ref name="WonderfulLife"&gt;{{cite book| title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History
| author=Gould, S.J.| authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould| year=1989| publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company| isbn=0-393-02705-8| oclc=185746546
}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought the matter into the public eye and raised questions about what the explosion represented. While differing significantly in details, both Whittington and Gould proposed that all modern animal phyla had appeared almost simultaneously in a rather short span of geological period. This view led to the modernization of Darwin's tree of life and the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which [[Niles Eldredge|Eldredge]] and Gould developed in the early 1970s and which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis "punctuated" by short periods of rapid change.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2004EarlySkeletalFossils"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | chapter=Early skeletal fossils

Other analyses, some more recent and some dating back to the 1970s, argue that complex animals similar to modern types evolved well before the start of the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="McNamara1996DatingOriginAnimals" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AwramikStromatoliteDiversityMetazoanAppearance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FedonkinWaggoner1997KimberellaMollusc"/&gt;

===Dating the Cambrian===
[[radiometric dating|Radiometric]] dates for much of the Cambrian, obtained by analysis of radioactive elements contained within rocks, have only recently become available, and for only a few regions.

Relative dating (''A'' was before ''B'') is often assumed sufficient for studying processes of evolution, but this, too, has been difficult, because of the problems involved in matching up rocks of the same age across different [[continent]]s.&lt;ref name="DatingProblems"&gt;e.g. {{Cite journal| last = Gehling| first = James| last2 = Jensen| first2 = Sören| last3 = Droser| first3 = Mary
| last4 = Myrow| first4 = Paul| last5 = Narbonne| first5 = Guy| title = Burrowing below the basal Cambrian GSSP, Fortune Head, Newfoundland| journal = Geological Magazine| volume = 138| issue = 2| pages = 213–218|date=March 2001| url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=74669| doi = 10.1017/S001675680100509X| bibcode = 2001GeoM..138..213G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, dates or descriptions of sequences of events should be regarded with some caution until better data become available.

===Body fossils===
Fossils of organisms' bodies are usually the most informative type of evidence. Fossilization is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by [[erosion]] or [[metamorphism]] before they can be observed. Hence, the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so as earlier times are considered. Despite this, they are often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life's history.&lt;ref name="BentonQualityFossilRecord"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benton MJ |author2=Wills MA |author3=Hitchin R |title=Quality of the fossil record through time |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6769 |pages=534–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10676959 |doi=10.1038/35000558|bibcode = 2000Natur.403..534B }}

&lt;/ref&gt; Also, biases exist in the fossil record: different environments are more favourable to the preservation of different types of organism or parts of organisms.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2003ExceptionalFossilPreservation"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Butterfield, N.J. | year =2003 | title = Exceptional Fossil Preservation and the Cambrian Explosion | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 166–177 | doi = 10.1093/icb/43.1.166 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/43/1/166 | access-date=2008-06-28 | pmid=21680421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, only the parts of organisms that were already [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralised]] are usually preserved, such as the shells of [[Mollusca|molluscs]]. Since most animal species are soft-bodied, they decay before they can become fossilised. As a result, although 30-plus phyla of living animals are known, two-thirds have never been found as fossils.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"&gt;{{cite book | author=Cowen, R. | title=History of Life | publisher=Blackwell Science | isbn=1-4051-1756-7| year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marrella (fossil).png|thumb| This ''[[Marrella]]'' specimen illustrates how clear and detailed the fossils from the [[Burgess Shale]] [[Lagerstätte]] are.]]
The Cambrian fossil record includes an unusually high number of [[lagerstätte]]n, which preserve soft tissues. These allow [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] to examine the internal anatomy of animals, which in other sediments are only represented by shells, spines, claws, etc.&amp;nbsp;– if they are preserved at all. The most significant Cambrian lagerstätten are the early Cambrian [[Maotianshan shale]] beds of Chengjiang ([[Yunnan]], [[China]]) and [[Sirius Passet]] ([[Greenland]]);&lt;ref name="ConwayMorris1979"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the late Cambrian [[Orsten]] ([[Sweden]]) fossil beds.

While lagerstätten preserve far more than the conventional fossil record, they are far from complete. Because lagerstätten are restricted to a narrow range of environments (where soft-bodied organisms can be preserved very quickly, e.g. by mudslides), most animals are probably not represented; further, the exceptional conditions that create lagerstätten probably do not represent normal living conditions.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"/&gt; In addition, the known Cambrian lagerstätten are rare and difficult to date, while Precambrian lagerstätten have yet to be studied in detail.

The sparseness of the fossil record means that organisms usually exist long before they are found in the fossil record&amp;nbsp;– this is known as the [[Signor–Lipps effect]].&lt;ref name="Signor1982"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Signor |first1=P.W. |last2=Lipps|first2=J.H. |chapter=Sampling bias, gradual extinction patterns and catastrophes in the fossil record |editor-last=Silver|editor-first=L.T.|editor2-last=Schulz|editor2-first=P.H. |title=Geological implications of impacts of large asteroids and comets on the earth |id=A 84–25651 10–42|pages=291–296 |publisher=Geological Society of America |year=1982 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efz87W88HawC&amp;pg=291&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0813721903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trace fossils===

Such changes may reflect a cause of the Cambrian explosion, although they may also have resulted from an increased level of biological activity&amp;nbsp;– a possible result of the explosion.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt; Despite these uncertainties, the geochemical evidence helps by making scientists focus on theories that are consistent with at least one of the likely environmental changes.

===Phylogenetic techniques===
[[Cladistics]] is a technique for working out the "family tree" of a set of organisms. It works by the logic that, if groups B and C have more similarities to each other than either has to group A, then B and C are more closely related to each other than either is to A. Characteristics that are compared may be [[Anatomy|anatomical]], such as the presence of a [[notochord]], or [[Molecular phylogeny|molecular]], by comparing sequences of [[DNA]] or [[protein]]. The result of a successful analysis is a hierarchy of [[clade]]s&amp;nbsp;– groups whose members are believed to share a common ancestor. The cladistic technique is sometimes problematic, as some features, such as wings or [[Evolution of the eye|camera eyes]], evolved more than once, [[convergent evolution|convergently]]&amp;nbsp;– this must be taken into account in analyses.

From the relationships, it may be possible to constrain the date that lineages first appeared. For instance, if fossils of B or C date to X&amp;nbsp;million years ago and the calculated "family tree" says A was an ancestor of B and C, then A must have evolved more than X&amp;nbsp;million years ago.

It is also possible to estimate how long ago two living clades diverged&amp;nbsp;– i.e. about how long ago their last common ancestor must have lived &amp;nbsp;– by assuming that DNA [[mutation]]s accumulate at a constant rate. These "[[molecular clock]]s", however, are fallible, and provide only a very approximate timing: they are not sufficiently precise and reliable for estimating when the groups that feature in the Cambrian explosion first evolved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Phylum===
A [[phylum]] is the highest level in the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean system for classifying organisms]]. Phyla can be thought of as groupings of animals based on general body plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Valentine
| first = James W. | year = 2004 | title = On the Origin of Phyla | publisher = University Of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | isbn = 0-226-84548-6 | page = 7
}}"&lt;cite&gt;Classifications of organisms in hierarchical systems were in use by the 17th and 18th centuries. Usually, organisms were grouped according to their morphological similarities as perceived by those early workers, and those groups were then grouped according to their similarities, and so on, to form a hierarchy.&lt;/cite&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the seemingly different external appearances of organisms, they are classified into phyla based on their internal and developmental organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| last = Parker
| first = Andrew
| year = 2003
| title = In the blink of an eye: How vision kick-started the big bang of evolution

| isbn = 0-7432-5733-2
| pages = 1–4
}}"&lt;cite&gt;Evolutionary biologists often make sense of the conflicting diversity of form&amp;nbsp;– not always does a relationship between internal and external parts. Early in the history of the subject, it became obvious that internal organisations were generally more important to the higher classification of animals than are external shapes. The internal organisation puts general restrictions on how an animal can exchange gases, obtain nutrients, and reproduce.&lt;/cite&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; For example, despite their obvious differences, [[spider]]s and [[barnacle]]s both belong to the phylum Arthropoda, but [[earthworm]]s and [[tapeworm]]s, although similar in shape, belong to different phyla.  As chemical and genetic testing becomes more accurate, previously hypothesised phyla are often entirely reworked.

A phylum is not a fundamental division of nature, such as the difference between [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s. It is simply a very high-level grouping in a [[Linnaean taxonomy|classification system]] created to describe all currently living organisms. This system is imperfect, even for modern animals: different books quote different numbers of phyla, mainly because they disagree about the classification of a huge number of worm-like species. As it is based on living organisms, it accommodates extinct organisms poorly, if at all.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jefferies1979OriginOfChordates"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Jefferies, R.P.S. | year=1979 | title=The origin of chordates&amp;nbsp;– a methodological essay | editor=House, M.R. | series=The origin of major invertebrate groups | pages=443–477 | publisher=Academic Press | location=London }} summarised in {{cite journal | author=Budd, G.E. | title=The Cambrian Fossil Record and the Origin of the Phyla | journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume=43 | issue=1 | pages=157–165 | doi=10.1093/icb/43.1.157 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/43/1/157 | year=2003 | pmid=21680420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stem group===
The concept of [[stem group]]s was introduced to cover evolutionary "aunts" and "cousins" of living groups, and have been hypothesized based on this scientific theory. A [[crown group]] is a group of closely related living animals plus their last common ancestor plus all its descendants. A stem group is a set of offshoots from the lineage at a point earlier than the last common ancestor of the crown group; it is a relative concept, for example [[tardigrade]]s are living animals that form a crown group in their own right, but Budd (1996) regarded them as also being a stem group relative to the arthropods.&lt;ref name="CraskeJefferies1989"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Craske, A.J. | author2=Jefferies, R.P.S. | year=1989 | title=A new mitrate from the Upper Ordovician of Norway, and a new approach to subdividing a plesion | journal=Palaeontology | volume=32 | pages=69–99 | url=http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2032/Pages%2069-99.pdf | format=PDF | access-date=2010-12-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824010939/http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2032/Pages%2069-99.pdf# | archive-date=2011-08-24 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd1996"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Groups that cannot easily be placed in an existing phylum are considered to be [[stem group]]s. A stem group annelid, for instance, is any group that was closely related to, but not within, the crown group "annelida". The stem group split off from the lineage that would lead to annelids, and eventually became extinct.

===Triploblastic===
The term ''[[Triploblastic]]'' means consisting of three layers, which are formed in the [[embryo]], quite early in the animal's development from a single-celled egg to a larva or juvenile form. The innermost layer forms the [[digestive tract]] (gut); the outermost forms skin; and the middle one forms muscles and all the internal organs except the digestive system. Most types of living animal are triploblastic&amp;nbsp;– the best-known exceptions are [[Porifera]] (sponges) and [[Cnidaria]] (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.).

===Bilaterian===
The [[bilateria]]ns are animals that have right and left sides at some point in their life histories. This implies that they have top and bottom surfaces and, importantly, distinct front and back ends. All known bilaterian animals are triploblastic, and all known triploblastic animals are bilaterian. Living [[echinoderm]]s ([[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumbers]], etc.) 'look' radially symmetrical (like wheels) rather than bilaterian, but their larvae exhibit bilateral symmetry and some of the earliest echinoderms may have been bilaterally symmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Paired gill slits in a fossil with a calcite skeleton | journal=Nature | issue=6891 | pages=841–844 |date=June 2002 | doi=10.1038/nature00805 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v417/n6891/abs/nature00805.html |author1=Dominguez, P. |author2=Jacobson, A.G. |author3=Jefferies, R.P.S. | volume=417 | pmid=12075349 | issn=0028-0836 |bibcode = 2002Natur.417..841D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Porifera and Cnidaria are radially symmetrical, not bilaterian, and not triploblastic.

===Coelomate===
The term ''[[Coelomate]]'' means having a body cavity (coelom) containing the internal organs. Most of the phyla featured in the debate about the Cambrian explosion are coelomates: arthropods, [[annelid]] worms, molluscs, echinoderms, and [[chordate]]s&amp;nbsp;– the noncoelomate [[priapulid]]s are an important exception. All known coelomate animals are triploblastic bilaterians, but some triploblastic bilaterian animals do not have a coelom&amp;nbsp;– for example [[flatworm]]s, whose organs are surrounded by [[parenchyma|unspecialized tissues]].

==Precambrian life==
Understanding of the Cambrian explosion relies upon knowing what was there beforehand{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}&amp;nbsp;– did the event herald the sudden appearance of a wide range of animals and behaviours, or did such things exist beforehand?

[[Phylogenetic analysis]] has been used to support the view that during the Cambrian explosion, metazoans (multi-celled animals) evolved [[monophyly|monophyletically]] from a single common ancestor: flagellated colonial [[protists]] similar to modern [[choanoflagellates]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Evidence of animals around 1 billion years ago ===
:''For further information, see [[Acritarch]] and [[Stromatolite]]''
[[File:CambrianStromatolites.jpg|right|thumb|[[Stromatolite]]s (Pika Formation, Middle Cambrian) near Helen Lake, [[Banff National Park]], Canada]]
[[File:Stromatolites in Sharkbay.jpg|right|thumb|Modern stromatolites in [[Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve]], Western Australia]]

Changes in the abundance and diversity of some types of fossil have been interpreted as evidence for "attacks" by animals or other organisms. Stromatolites, stubby pillars built by colonies of [[microorganism]]s, are a major constituent of the fossil record from about {{Ma|2700}}, but their abundance and diversity declined steeply after about {{Ma|1250}}. This decline has been attributed to disruption by grazing and burrowing animals.&lt;ref name="McNamara1996DatingOriginAnimals"&gt;

Precambrian marine diversity was dominated by small fossils known as [[acritarch]]s. This term describes almost any small organic walled fossil – from the egg cases of small [[animal|metazoans]] to resting [[cyst]]s of many different kinds of [[chlorophyta|green algae]]. After appearing around {{Ma|2000}}, acritarchs underwent a boom around {{Ma|1000}}, increasing in abundance, diversity, size, complexity of shape, and especially size and number of spines. Their increasingly spiny forms in the last 1 billion years may indicate an increased need for defence against predation. Other groups of small organisms from the [[Neoproterozoic]] era also show signs of antipredator defenses.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt; A consideration of taxon longevity appears to support an increase in predation pressure around this time.&lt;ref name="Stanley2008"&gt;

Around the start of the Cambrian (about {{Ma|542}}), many new types of traces first appear, including well-known vertical burrows such as ''[[Diplocraterion]]'' and ''[[Skolithos]]'', and traces normally attributed to arthropods, such as ''[[Cruziana]]'' and ''[[Rusophycus]]''. The vertical burrows indicate that worm-like animals acquired new behaviours, and possibly new physical capabilities. Some Cambrian trace fossils indicate that their makers possessed hard [[exoskeleton]]s, although they were not necessarily mineralised.&lt;ref name="Jensen2003" /&gt;

Burrows provide firm evidence of complex organisms; they are also much more readily preserved than body fossils, to the extent that the absence of trace fossils has been used to imply the genuine absence of large, motile, bottom-dwelling organisms.{{Citation needed|reason=try Budd|date=June 2008}} They provide a further line of evidence to show that the Cambrian explosion represents a real diversification, and is not a preservational artefact.&lt;ref name="Seilacher2005"/&gt;

This new habit changed the seafloor's geochemistry, and led to decreased oxygen in the ocean and increased CO2-levels in the seas and the atmosphere, resulting in global warming for tens of millions years, and could be responsible for mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inverse.com/article/46647-global-warming-animals-cambrian-carbon-dioxide Early Global Warming Was Unexpectedly Caused by a Burst of Tiny Life Forms - Inverse]&lt;/ref&gt; But as burrowing became established, it allowed an explosion of its own,&lt;!--this is carefully worded so as not to imply that was neither a part of the Cambrian explosion, or necessarily different from it&amp;nbsp;– please take this into account when rewording!--&gt; for as burrowers disturbed the sea floor, they aerated it, mixing oxygen into the toxic muds. This made the bottom sediments more hospitable, and allowed a wider range of organisms to inhabit them&amp;nbsp;– creating new niches and the scope for higher diversity.&lt;ref name="Seilacher2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seilacher, Adolf |author2=Luis A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there seems little doubt that ''Kimberella'' was at least a triploblastic bilaterian animal.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2006"/&gt; These organisms are central to the debate about how abrupt the Cambrian explosion was. If some were early members of the animal phyla seen today, the "explosion" looks a lot less sudden than if all these organisms represent an unrelated "experiment", and were replaced by the animal kingdom fairly soon thereafter (40M years is "soon" by evolutionary and geological standards).

===Beck Spring Dolomite===
Paul Knauth, a geologist at [[Arizona State University]], maintains that photosynthesizing organisms such as algae may have grown over a 750- to 800-million-year-old formation in [[Death Valley]] known as the Beck Spring Dolomite. In the early 1990s, samples from this 1,000-foot thick layer of dolomite revealed that the region housed flourishing mats of photosynthesizing, unicellular life forms which antedated the Cambrian explosion.

Microfossils have been unearthed from holes riddling the otherwise barren surface of the dolomite. These geochemical and microfossil findings support the idea that during the Precambrian period, complex life evolved both in the oceans and on land. Knauth contends that animals may well have had their origins in freshwater lakes and streams, and not in the oceans.

Some 30 years later, a number of studies have documented an abundance of geochemical and microfossil evidence showing that life covered the continents as far back as 2.2 billion years ago. Many paleobiologists now accept the idea that simple life forms existed on land during the Precambrian, but are opposed to the more radical idea that multicellular life thrived on land more than 600 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/death-valleys-first-life-came-in-by-land-not-by-sea/ "Scientific American" April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they are as hard to classify as most other Ediacaran organisms, they are important in two other ways.

==Cambrian life==
=== Trace fossils ===
Trace fossils (burrows, etc.) are a reliable indicator of what life was around, and indicate a diversification of life around the start of the Cambrian, with the freshwater realm colonized by animals almost as quickly as the oceans.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kennedy | first1 = M.

===Small shelly fauna===
{{Main|Small shelly fauna}}
Fossils known as "[[small shelly fauna]]" have been found in many parts on the world, and date from just before the Cambrian to about 10 million years after the start of the Cambrian (the [[Nemakit-Daldynian]] and [[Tommotian]] ages; see [[#Timeline|timeline]]). These are a very mixed collection of fossils: spines, sclerites (armor plates), tubes, [[archeocyathid]]s (sponge-like animals), and small shells very like those of [[brachiopod]]s and snail-like molluscs&amp;nbsp;– but all tiny, mostly 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;mm long.&lt;ref name="Matthews1975"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While small, these fossils are far more common than complete fossils of the organisms that produced them; crucially, they cover the window from the start of the Cambrian to the first lagerstätten: a period of time otherwise lacking in fossils. Hence, they supplement the conventional fossil record and allow the fossil ranges of many groups to be extended.

===Early Cambrian trilobites and echinoderms===
[[File:Olenoides serratus oblique with antennas.jpg|thumb|A fossilized trilobite, an ancient type of [[arthropod]]: This specimen, from the Burgess Shale, preserves "soft parts"&amp;nbsp;– the antennae and legs. ]]

The fossil record of trilobites began with the appearance of trilobites with mineral exoskeletons – not from the time of their origin.

The earliest generally accepted echinoderm fossils appeared a little bit later, in the Late [[Atdabanian]]; unlike modern echinoderms, these early Cambrian echinoderms were not all radially symmetrical.&lt;ref name="DornbosBottjer2000Helicoplacoids"&gt;{{cite journal

These provide firm data points for the "end" of the explosion, or at least indications that the crown groups of modern phyla were represented.

===Burgess Shale type faunas===
{{main|Burgess Shale type preservation}}
The Burgess Shale and similar lagerstätten preserve the soft parts of organisms, which provide a wealth of data to aid in the classification of enigmatic fossils. It often preserved complete specimens of organisms only otherwise known from dispersed parts, such as loose scales or isolated mouthparts. Further, the majority of organisms and taxa in these horizons are entirely soft-bodied, hence absent from the rest of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2003"&gt;{{cite journal

Because the lagerstätten provide a mode and quality of preservation that is virtually absent outside of the Cambrian, many organisms appear completely different from anything known from the conventional fossil record. This led early workers in the field to attempt to shoehorn the organisms into extant phyla; the shortcomings of this approach led later workers to erect a multitude of new phyla to accommodate all the oddballs. It has since been realised that most oddballs diverged from [[stem group|lineages]] before they established the phyla known today{{Clarify|date=August 2008}}&amp;nbsp;– slightly different designs, which were fated to perish rather than flourish into phyla, as their cousin lineages did.

The preservational mode is rare in the preceding Ediacaran period, but those assemblages known show no trace of animal life&amp;nbsp;– perhaps implying a genuine absence of macroscopic metazoans.&lt;ref name="Xiao2002"&gt;{{cite journal

===Early Cambrian crustaceans===
{{Details|Orsten}}
Crustaceans, one of the four great modern groups of arthropods, are very rare throughout the Cambrian. Convincing crustaceans were once thought to be common in Burgess Shale-type biotas, but none of these individuals can be shown to fall into the crown group of "true crustaceans".&lt;ref name="Harvey2008"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cambrian record of crown-group crustaceans comes from microfossils. The Swedish [[Orsten]] horizons contain later Cambrian crustaceans, but only organisms smaller than 2&amp;nbsp;mm are preserved. This restricts the data set to juveniles and miniaturised adults.

A more informative data source is the organic microfossils of the [[Mount Cap formation]], Mackenzie Mountains, Canada. This late Early Cambrian assemblage ({{Ma|510|515}}) consists of microscopic fragments of arthropods' cuticle, which is left behind when the rock is dissolved with [[hydrofluoric acid]]. The diversity of this assemblage is similar to that of modern crustacean faunas. Analysis of fragments of feeding machinery found in the formation shows that it was adapted to feed in a very precise and refined fashion. This contrasts with most other early Cambrian arthropods, which fed messily by shovelling anything they could get their feeding appendages on into their mouths. This sophisticated and specialised feeding machinery belonged to a large (about 30&amp;nbsp;cm)&lt;ref&gt;{{PalAss2007|title=The ecology and phylogeny of Cambrian pancrustaceans|author=Harvey, T.P.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; organism, and would have provided great potential for diversification; specialised feeding apparatus allows a number of different approaches to feeding and development, and creates a number of different approaches to avoid being eaten.&lt;ref name="Harvey2008"/&gt;

===Early Ordovician radiation===
{{Main|Ordovician radiation}}
After an [[Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event|extinction]] at the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary, another radiation occurred, which established the taxa that would dominate the Palaeozoic.&lt;ref name="Droser2003"/&gt;

Different authors break the explosion down into stages in different ways.

Ed Landing recognizes three stages: Stage 1, spanning the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, corresponds to a diversification of biomineralizing animals and of deep and complex burrows; Stage 2, corresponding to the radiation of molluscs and stem-group [[Brachiopod]]s ([[hyolith]]s and [[tommotiid]]s), which apparently arose in intertidal waters; and Stage 3, seeing the Atdabanian diversification of trilobites in deeper waters, but little change in the intertidal realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Landing | first1=E. | last2=Kouchinsky | first2=A.

Graham Budd synthesises various schemes to produce a compatible view of the SSF record of the Cambrian explosion, divided slightly differently into four intervals: a "Tube world", lasting from {{Ma|550|536}}, spanning the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, dominated by Cloudina, Namacalathus and pseudoconodont-type elements; a "Sclerite world", seeing the rise of halkieriids, tommotiids, and hyoliths, lasting to the end of the Fortunian (c. 525 Ma); a brachiopod world, perhaps corresponding to the as yet unratified Cambrian Stage 2; and Trilobite World, kicking off in Stage 3.&lt;ref name="Budd, G.E. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Budd | first1=G.E. | last2=Jackson | first2=I.S.C. | year=2016 | title=Ecological innovations in the Cambrian and the origins of the crown group phyla | journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B | volume=371 |  page=20150287 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2015.0287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complementary to the shelly fossil record, trace fossils can be divided into five subdivisions: "Flat world" (late Ediacaran), with traces restricted to the sediment surface; Protreozoic III (after Jensen), with increasing complexity; ''pedum'' world, initiated at the base of the Cambrian with the base of the ''T.pedum'' zone (see discussion at [[Cambrian#Dating the Cambrian]]); ''Rusophycus'' world, spanning {{Ma|536|521}} and thus corresponding exactly to the periods of Sclerite World and Brachiopod World under the SSF paradigm; and ''Cruziana'' world, with an obvious correspondence to Trilobite World.

The fossil record as Darwin knew it seemed to suggest that the major metazoan groups appeared in a few million years of the early to mid-Cambrian, and even in the 1980s, this still appeared to be the case.&lt;ref name="Whittington1985BurgessShale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WonderfulLife"/&gt;

However, evidence of Precambrian Metazoa is gradually accumulating.

Some say that the evolutionary change was accelerated by an [[order of magnitude]],{{refn |group=note |As defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt;}} but the presence of Precambrian animals somewhat dampens the "bang" of the explosion; not only was the appearance of animals gradual, but their [[evolutionary radiation]] ("diversification") may also not have been as rapid as once thought.

===The Cambrian explosion as survivorship bias===

[[Graham Budd|Budd]] and Mann&lt;ref name="POTPa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Budd |first1=G. E. |last2=Mann |first2=R. P. |title=History is written by the victors: the effect of the push of the past on the fossil record |journal=Evolution |date=2018 |volume=72 |issue=11 |pages=2276-229 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.13593}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the Cambrian explosion was the result of a type of [[survivorship bias]] called the "[[Push of the past]]". As groups at their origin tend to go extinct, it follows that any long-lived group would have experienced an unusually rapid rate of diversification early on, creating the illusion of a general speed-up in diversification rates. However, rates of diversification could remain at background levels and still generate this sort of effect in the surviving lineages.

==Possible causes==
Despite the evidence that moderately complex animals ([[triploblastic]] [[bilateria]]ns) existed before and possibly long before the start of the Cambrian, it seems that the pace of evolution was exceptionally fast in the early Cambrian. Possible explanations for this fall into three broad categories: environmental, developmental, and ecological changes. Any explanation must explain both the timing and magnitude of the explosion.

===Changes in the environment===
====Increase in oxygen levels====
[[Earth's atmosphere#Evolution of Earth's atmosphere|Earth's earliest atmosphere]] contained no free [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); the oxygen that animals breathe today, both in the air and dissolved in water, is the product of billions of years of [[photosynthesis]]. Cyanobacteria were the first organisms to evolve the ability to photosynthesize, introducing a steady supply of oxygen into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schirrmeister|first1=B.E.|last2=deVos|first2=J.M|last3=Antonelli|first3=A.|last4=Bagherri|first4=H.C.|title=Evolution of multicellularity coincided with increased diversification of cyanobacteria and the Great Oxidation Event|journal=PNAS|date=2013|volume=110|issue=5|pages=1791–1796|doi=10.1073/pnas.1209927110|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.1791S|pmid=23319632|pmc=3562814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, oxygen levels did not increase substantially in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Canfield|first1=D.E.|last2=Poulton|first2=S.W.|last3=Narbonne|first3=G.M.|title=Late-Neoproterozoic Deep-Ocean Oxygenation and the Rise of Animal Life|journal=Science|date=2007|volume=315|doi=10.1126/science.1135013|pmid=17158290|issue=5808|pages=92–5|bibcode=2007Sci...315...92C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen quickly reacted with iron and other minerals in the surrounding rock and ocean water. Once a saturation point was reached for the reactions in rock and water, oxygen was able to exist as a gas in its diatomic form. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere increased substantially afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bekker|first1=A.|last2=Holland|first2=H.D.|last3=Wang|first3=P.I.|last4=Rumble, III|first4=D.|last5=Stein|first5=H.J.|last6=Hannah|first6=J.L.|last7=Coetzee|first7=L.L.|last8=Beukes|first8=H.J.|title=Dating the rise of atmospheric oxygen|journal=Nature|date=2003|volume=427|issue=6970|pages=117–120|doi=10.1038/nature02260|pmid=14712267|bibcode=2004Natur.427..117B}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general trend, the [[concentration]] of oxygen in the atmosphere has risen gradually over about the last 2.5 billion years.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt;

Oxygen levels seem to have a positive correlation with diversity in eukaryotes well before the Cambrian period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parfrey|first1=L.W.|last2=Lahr|first2=D.J.G.|last3=Knoll|first3=A.H.|last4=Katz|first4=L.A.|title=Estimating the timing of early eukaryotic diversification with multigene molecular clocks|journal=PNAS|date=2011|volume=108|issue=33|pages=13624–13629|doi=10.1073/pnas.1110633108|pmid=21810989|pmc=3158185|bibcode = 2011PNAS..10813624P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes is thought to have lived around 1.8 billion years ago. Around 800 million years ago, there was a notable increase in the complexity and number of eukaryotes species in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Before the spike in diversity, eukaryotes are thought to have lived in highly sulfuric environments. Sulfide interferes with mitochondrial function in aerobic organisms, limiting the amount of oxygen that could be used to drive metabolism. Oceanic sulfide levels decreased around 800 million years ago, which supports the importance of oxygen in eukaryotic diversity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The shortage of oxygen might well have prevented the rise of large, complex animals. The amount of oxygen an animal can absorb is largely determined by the area of its oxygen-absorbing surfaces (lungs and gills in the most complex animals; the skin in less complex ones); but, the amount needed is determined by its volume, which grows faster than the oxygen-absorbing area if an animal's size increases equally in all directions. An increase in the concentration of oxygen in air or water would increase the size to which an organism could grow without its tissues becoming starved of oxygen. However, members of the Ediacara biota reached metres in length tens of millions of years before the Cambrian explosion.&lt;ref name="Knoll1999"&gt;e.g. {{cite journal

====Ozone formation====
The amount of ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) required to shield Earth from biologically lethal UV radiation, wavelengths from 200 to 300 nanometers (nm), is believed to have been in existence around the Cambrian explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keese| first1=Bob|title=Ozone| url=http://www.albany.edu/faculty/rgk/atm101/ozone.htm|website=www.albany.edu |publisher=University at Albany| access-date=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the [[ozone layer]] may have enabled the development of complex life and life on land, as opposed to life being restricted to the water.

====Snowball Earth====
{{main|Snowball Earth}}
In the late [[Neoproterozoic]] (extending into the early [[Ediacaran]] period), the Earth suffered [[Snowball Earth|massive glaciations]] in which most of its surface was covered by ice. This may have caused a mass extinction, creating a genetic bottleneck; the resulting diversification may have given rise to the [[Ediacara biota]], which appears soon after the last "Snowball Earth" episode.&lt;ref name="HoffmanKaufman1998NeoproterozoicSnowball"&gt;{{cite journal

However, the snowball episodes occurred a long time before the start of the Cambrian, and it is hard to see how so much diversity could have been caused by even a series of bottlenecks;&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt; the cold periods may even have ''delayed'' the evolution of large size organisms.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt;

====Increase in the calcium concentration of the Cambrian seawater====
Newer research suggests that volcanically active midocean ridges caused a massive and sudden surge of the calcium concentration in the oceans, making it possible for marine organisms to build skeletons and hard body parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibecbarcelona.eu/novel-evolutionary-theory-for-the-explosion-of-life/ Novel Evolutionary Theory For The Explosion Of Life]&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively a high influx of ions could have been provided by the widespread erosion that produced Powell's [[Great Unconformity]].&lt;ref name="Peters2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peters | first1 = S.

An increase of calcium may also have been caused by erosion of the [[East African Orogeny|Transgondwanan Supermountain]] that existed at the time the explosion. The roots of the mountain are preserved in present-day [[East Africa]] as an [[orogeny|orogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Developmental explanations===
{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

A range of theories are based on the concept that minor [[Evolutionary developmental biology|modifications to animals' development]] as they grow from [[embryo]] to adult may have been able to cause very large changes in the final adult form. The [[Hox gene]]s, for example, control which organs individual regions of an embryo will develop into. For instance, if a certain ''Hox'' gene is expressed, a region will develop into a limb; if a different Hox gene is expressed in that region (a minor change), it could develop into an eye instead (a phenotypically major change).

Such a system allows a large range of disparity to appear from a limited set of genes, but such theories linking this with the explosion struggle to explain why the origin of such a development system should by itself lead to increased diversity or disparity. Evidence of Precambrian metazoans&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt; combines with molecular data&lt;ref name="deRosa1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Rosa, R. |author2=Grenier, J.K. |author3=Andreeva, T. |author4=Cook, C.E. |author5=Adoutte, A. |author6=Akam, M. |author7=Carroll, S.B. |author8=Balavoine, G. |date=June 1999 | doi = 10.1038/21631 | journal = Nature | volume = 399 |title=Hox genes in brachiopods and priapulids and protostome evolution | pmid = 10391241  | issue = 6738 | issn = 0028-0836 | pages = 772–6|bibcode = 1999Natur.399..772D }}&lt;/ref&gt; to show that much of the genetic architecture that could feasibly have played a role in the explosion was already well established by the Cambrian.

This apparent paradox is addressed in a theory that focuses on the [[physics]] of development. It is proposed that the emergence of simple multicellular forms provided a changed context and spatial scale in which novel physical processes and effects were mobilized by the products of genes that had previously evolved to serve unicellular functions. Morphological complexity (layers, segments, lumens, appendages) arose, in this view, by [[self-organization]].&lt;ref name="Newman2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Newman, S.A.  |author2=Bhat, R. |date=April 2008 | doi = 10.1088/1478-3975/5/1/015008| journal = Physical Biology | volume = 5 | page = 0150580|title=Dynamical patterning modules: physico-genetic determinants of morphological development and evolution | pmid = 18403826  | issue = 1 | issn = 1478-3967|bibcode = 2008PhBio...5a5008N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horizontal gene transfer]] has also been identified as a possible factor in the rapid acquisition of the biochemical capability of biomineralization among organisms during this period, based on evidence that the gene for a critical protein in the process was originally transferred from a bacterium into sponges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Daniel J.|last2=Macis|first2=Luciana|last3=Reitner|first3=Joachim|last4=Wörheide|first4=Gert|title=A horizontal gene transfer supported the evolution of an early metazoan biomineralization strategy|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=12 August 2011|volume=11|page=238|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-238|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/238|access-date=10 September 2014|pmid=21838889|pmc=3163562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological explanations===
These focus on the interactions between different types of organism. Some of these hypotheses deal with changes in the [[food chain]]; some suggest [[Evolutionary arms race|arms races]] between predators and prey, and others focus on the more general mechanisms of [[coevolution]]. Such theories are well suited to explaining why there was a rapid increase in both disparity and diversity, but they must explain why the "explosion" happened when it did.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt;

====End-Ediacaran mass extinction====
{{main|End-Ediacaran extinction}}
Evidence for such an extinction includes the disappearance from the fossil record of the Ediacara biota and shelly fossils such as ''Cloudina'', and the accompanying perturbation in the {{d13c|link}} record.

Mass extinctions are often followed by [[adaptive radiation]]s as existing clades expand to occupy the ecospace emptied by the extinction. However, once the dust had settled, overall disparity and diversity returned to the pre-extinction level in each of the Phanerozoic extinctions.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt;

====Evolution of eyes====
{{main|Evolution of the eye}}
[[Andrew Parker (zoologist)|Andrew Parker]] has proposed that predator-prey relationships changed dramatically after eyesight evolved. Prior to that time, hunting and evading were both close-range affairs&amp;nbsp;– smell, vibration, and touch were the only senses used. When predators could see their prey from a distance, new defensive strategies were needed. Armor, spines, and similar defenses may also have evolved in response to vision. He further observed that, where animals lose vision in unlighted environments such as caves, diversity of animal forms tends to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Parker, Andrew | title=In the Blink of an Eye |publisher= Perseus Books |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=2003 | isbn=0-7382-0607-5 | oclc=52074044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many scientists doubt that vision could have caused the explosion. Eyes may well have evolved long before the start of the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="McCall2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author = McCall | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.earscirev.2005.08.004 | title = The Vendian (Ediacaran) in the geological record: Enigmas in geology's prelude to the Cambrian explosion | journal = Earth-Science Reviews | volume = 77 | pages = 1–229 |bibcode = 2006ESRv...77....1M }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also difficult to understand why the evolution of eyesight would have caused an explosion, since other senses, such as smell and pressure detection, can detect things at a greater distance in the sea than sight can; but the appearance of these other senses apparently did not cause an evolutionary explosion.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt;

====Arms races between predators and prey====
The ability to avoid or recover from [[predation]] often makes the difference between life and death, and is therefore one of the strongest components of [[natural selection]]. The pressure to adapt is stronger on the prey than on the predator: if the predator fails to win a contest, it loses a meal; if the prey is the loser, it loses its life.&lt;ref name="DawkinsKrebs1979ArmsRaces"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Arms races between and within species| volume=205| issue=1161| pages=489–511| date=September 21, 1979| jstor=77442 |author1=Dawkins, R. |author2=Krebs, R.J.| doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0081
| journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]| pmid=42057| bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..489D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, there is evidence that predation was rife long before the start of the Cambrian, for example in the increasingly spiny forms of acritarchs, the holes drilled in ''Cloudina'' shells, and traces of burrowing to avoid predators. Hence, it is unlikely that the ''appearance'' of predation was the trigger for the Cambrian "explosion", although it may well have exhibited a strong influence on the body forms that the "explosion" produced.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt; However, the intensity of predation does appear to have increased dramatically during the Cambrian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1988 |author=McMenamin, M.

====Increase in size and diversity of planktonic animals====
[[Geochemical]] evidence strongly indicates that the total mass of [[plankton]] has been similar to modern levels since early in the Proterozoic. Before the start of the Cambrian, their corpses and droppings were too small to fall quickly towards the seabed, since their [[drag (physics)|drag]] was about the same as their weight. This meant they were destroyed by [[scavenger]]s or by chemical processes before they reached the sea floor.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"&gt;{{cite journal

Mesozooplankton are plankton of a larger size. Early Cambrian specimens [[Filter feeder|filtered]] microscopic plankton from the seawater. These larger organisms would have produced droppings and corpses that were large enough to fall fairly quickly. This provided a new supply of energy and nutrients to the mid-levels and bottoms of the seas, which opened up a huge range of new possible ways of life. If any of these remains sank uneaten to the sea floor they could be buried; this would have taken some [[carbon]] out of [[Carbon cycle|circulation]], resulting in an increase in the [[concentration]] of breathable oxygen in the seas (carbon readily [[Chemical compound|combines]] with oxygen).&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"/&gt;

The initial herbivorous mesozooplankton were probably larvae of benthic (seafloor) animals. A larval stage was probably an evolutionary innovation driven by the increasing level of predation at the seafloor during the [[Ediacaran]] period.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001ECR"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metazoans have an amazing ability to increase diversity through [[coevolution]].&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt; This means that an organism's traits can lead to traits evolving in other organisms; a number of responses are possible, and a different species can potentially emerge from each one. As a simple example, the evolution of predation may have caused one organism to develop a defence, while another developed motion to flee. This would cause the predator lineage to split into two species: one that was good at chasing prey, and another that was good at breaking through defences. Actual coevolution is somewhat more subtle, but, in this fashion, great diversity can arise: three quarters of living species are animals, and most of the rest have formed by coevolution with animals.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt;

===Ecosystem engineering===
Evolving organisms inevitably change the environment they evolve in. The [[Devonian]] [[Colonization of the land|colonization of land]] had planet-wide consequences for sediment cycling and ocean nutrients, and was likely linked to the [[Devonian extinction|Devonian mass extinction]]. A similar process may have occurred on smaller scales in the oceans, with, for example, the sponges filtering particles from the water and depositing them in the mud in a more digestible form; or burrowing organisms making previously unavailable resources available for other organisms.&lt;ref name="Erwin2011a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Erwin | first1 = D.

===Complexity threshold===
The explosion may not have been a significant evolutionary event. It may represent a threshold being crossed: for example a threshold in genetic complexity that allowed a vast range of morphological forms to be employed.&lt;ref name="SoléFernándezKauffman2003AdaptiveWalks"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genetic threshold may have a correlation to the amount of oxygen available to organisms. Using oxygen for metabolism produces much more energy than anaerobic processes. Organisms that use more oxygen have the opportunity to produce more complex proteins, providing a template for further evolution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These proteins translate into larger, more complex structures that allow organisms better to adapt to their environments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperling|first1=E.A.|last2=Frieder|first2=C.A.|last3=Raman|first3=A.V.|last4=Girguis|first4=P.R.|last5=Levin|first5=L.A.|last6=Knoll|first6=A.H.|title=Oxygen, ecology, and the Cambrian radiation of animals|journal=PNAS|date=2013|volume=110|issue=33|pages=13446–13451|doi=10.1073/pnas.1312778110|pmid=23898193|bibcode=2013PNAS..11013446S|pmc=3746845}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of oxygen, genes that code for these proteins could contribute to the expression of [[complex traits]] more efficiently. Access to a wider range of structures and functions would allow organisms to evolve in different directions, increasing the number of niches that could be inhabited. Furthermore, organisms had the opportunity to become more specialized in their own niches.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Uniqueness of the explosion==
The "Cambrian explosion" can be viewed as two waves of metazoan expansion into empty niches: first, a [[coevolution]]ary rise in diversity as animals explored niches on the Ediacaran sea floor, followed by a second expansion in the early Cambrian as they became established in the water column.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Butterfield | first1 = N. J.| year = 2007| title = Macroevolution and macroecology through deep time| journal = Palaeontology| volume = 50| issue = 1| pages = 41–55| doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00613.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of diversification seen in the Cambrian phase of the explosion is unparalleled among marine animals: it affected all metazoan [[clade]]s of which Cambrian fossils have been found. Later [[Evolutionary radiation|radiations]], such as those of [[fish]] in the [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]] periods, involved fewer [[taxon|taxa]], mainly with very similar body plans.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt; Although the recovery from the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic extinction]] started with about as few animal species as the Cambrian explosion, the recovery produced far fewer significantly new types of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Erwin |first=D.H. |author2=Valentine, J.W. |author3=Sepkoski, J.J. |date=November 1987| title=A Comparative Study of Diversification Events: The Early Paleozoic Versus the Mesozoic |journal=Evolution |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1177–1186 |doi=10.2307/2409086 |pmid=11542112|jstor=2409086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever triggered the early Cambrian diversification opened up an exceptionally wide range of previously unavailable [[ecological niche]]s. When these were all occupied, limited space existed for such wide-ranging diversifications to occur again, because strong competition existed in all niches and [[wikt:incumbent|incumbent]]s usually had the advantage. If a wide range of empty niches had continued, clades would be able to continue diversifying and become disparate enough for us to recognise them as different [[phylum|phyla]]; when niches are filled, lineages will continue to resemble one another long after they diverge, as limited opportunity exists for them to change their life-styles and forms.&lt;ref name="Valentine1995WhyNoNewPhyla"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Why No New Phyla after the Cambrian?

| bibcode=1995Palai..10..190V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two similar explosions in the [[Evolutionary history of plants#Colonisation of land|evolution of land plants]]: after a cryptic history beginning about {{Ma|450}}, land plants underwent a uniquely rapid adaptive radiation during the Devonian period, about {{Ma|400}}.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt; Furthermore, Angiosperms ([[flowering plant]]s) originated and rapidly diversified during the Cretaceous period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2935">The '''Cebeci–Smith model''' is a 0-equation [[eddy viscosity]] model used in [[computational fluid dynamics]] analysis of [[turbulence|turbulent]] [[boundary layer]] flows. The model gives eddy viscosity, &lt;math&gt;\mu_t&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of the local boundary layer velocity profile. The model is suitable for high-speed flows with thin attached boundary-layers, typically present in aerospace applications.  Like the [[Baldwin-Lomax model]], this model is not suitable for cases with large [[flow separation|separated]] regions and significant curvature/rotation effects.  Unlike the [[Baldwin-Lomax model]], this model requires the determination of a boundary layer edge.

The model was developed by [[Tuncer Cebeci]] and [[Apollo M. O. Smith]], in 1967.

== Equations ==

In a two-layer model, the boundary layer is considered to comprise two layers: inner (close to the surface) and outer. The eddy viscosity is calculated separately for each layer and combined using:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mu_t =
\begin{cases}
{\mu_t}_\text{inner} &amp; \mbox{if } y \le y_\text{crossover} \\ 
{\mu_t}_\text{outer} &amp; \mbox{if } y &gt; y_\text{crossover}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;y_\text{crossover}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest distance from the surface where &lt;math&gt;{\mu_t}_\text{inner}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;{\mu_t}_\text{outer}&lt;/math&gt;.

The inner-region eddy viscosity is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mu_t}_\text{inner} = \rho \ell^2 \left[\left(
 \frac{\partial U}{\partial y}\right)^2 +
 \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\right)^2
\right]^{1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\ell = \kappa y \left( 1 - e^{-y^+/A^+} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

with the von Karman constant &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; usually being taken as 0.4, and with

:&lt;math&gt;
A^+ = 26\left[1+y\frac{dP/dx}{\rho u_\tau^2}\right]^{-1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The eddy viscosity in the outer region is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mu_t}_\text{outer} = \alpha \rho U_e \delta_v^* F_K
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0.0168&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta_v^*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[displacement thickness]], given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_v^* = \int_0^\delta \left(1 - \frac{U}{U_e}\right)\,dy
&lt;/math&gt;

and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; is the Klebanoff intermittency function given by

:&lt;math&gt;
F_K = \left[1 + 5.5 \left( \frac{y}{\delta} \right)^6
  \right]^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10895">'''The Center for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR)''' is a Canadian, [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[civil rights]] organization committed to promoting racial harmony and [[social equality|equality]]. The organization functions as a service for victims of [[discrimination]] through activities involving [[advocacy]], [[research]] and [[legal representation]]. It is considered a leader among non-profit organizations of its type in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;CRARR. "Our Mandate and Services." Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations. 21 Feb 2010. http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/1&lt;/ref&gt;

The CRARR has supported and assisted over 250 victims of discrimination since its inception in 1983. It takes on approximately 75 new cases per year.&lt;ref&gt;CRARR. "Services for Victims of Discrimination." Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations. 21 Feb 2010. http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/15&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of individuals aided come from the [[Montreal]] area, however, assistance is not limited to this region.

==History==

The organization was founded in 1983 in Montreal, [[Quebec]], Canada and while it has expanded the reach of its work to other parts of Canada, it maintains its base in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;CRARR. "Our Mandate and Services."  Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations. 21 Feb 2010. http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/1&lt;/ref&gt; It was co-founded by Fo Niemi, who has maintained the title of [[executive director]] since the organization’s creation.

==Mission statement==

	The organization’s motto is "United for Diversity and Racial Equality." Its mandate, broadly speaking, is "to promote racial harmony and equality in Canada".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;
The organization is actively engaged in promoting equality and multicultural representation in Canada through various activities. As such, the CRARR has a strong commitment to promoting [[racial equality]], believing that "When it comes to real inclusion—real integration, real presence in decision-making positions—we still have a fairly long way to go".&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Reilly, et al., eds. Racism: A Global Reader. (Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2002) 334&lt;/ref&gt; This position demonstrates the organization’s belief that underrepresentation of minorities is a [[social injustice]] that must be corrected.

The CRARR’s areas of expertise include discrimination and [[harassment]] in employment; discrimination in school discipline; [[hate crime]]s and hate incidents; hate on the [[internet]]; [[homophobia]]; [[media bias]]; [[racial profiling]] in public services and employment; systemic [[racism]] and critical race analysis and union misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;CRARR. "Services for Victims of Discrimination." Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations. 21 Feb 2010. http://www.crarr.org/?q=node/15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activities==

'''i. Services and Activities''' &lt;br /&gt;
The organization’s goals are largely focused on policy interventions, [[public education]] and mobilization, promotion and recognition, research-action, and training and consulting. More specifically, the organization offers a wide range of services and activities, including:

{{quote|
a.	Advocacy and defence for victims of discrimination based on race, religion, ethnic or national origin, [[citizenship]] status and related characteristics.

b.	Charter research and litigation on racial equality issues

c.	Conferences, consultations and seminars on different [[race relations]] and equality rights issues

d.	Research-action projects on systemic racism and on racial minorities’ needs

e.	Interventions and advocacy before legislative, administrative, regulatory and judicial agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Media Awareness Network. "Center for Research-Action on Race Relations." 2010. Media Awareness Network. 19 Feb 2010. {{cite web |url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/profiles/advocacy/crarr_profile.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117054515/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/profiles/advocacy/crarr_profile.cfm |archivedate=2010-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition, the organization also honours an individual or non-profit organization with its bi-annual Frederick Johnson award. Past recipients include Hank Avery, African-Canadian who pushed for the recognition of a black slave’s cemetery in Quebec,&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; the organization Mothers United Against Racism and Hon. [[Irwin Cotler]], Canada’s former Minister of Justice and Attorney-General.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Questions from the Center for Research-Action on Race Relations. (Geneva: 2007) 6. http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/crarr.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004-2005, the CRARR hosted a conference on [[youth crime]] prevention. Additionally, the organization hosts an annual lecture on Diversity in Canadian Media that is co-sponsored by the department of Communication Studies at [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations 6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ii. Recent Activities'''&lt;br /&gt;
The CRARR, represented by Civil Rights Advocate Elena Toews, is currently assisting two groups of black residents of Southwest Montreal who have filed claims with the Quebec Human Rights Commission. The individuals, Samantha Hyman-Roberts and Gallo Cham, have claimed that they were both racially profiled and [[abuse]]d by [[Transit authority|transit authorities]] after failing to show proof that they had purchased transit tickets. Both Hyman-Roberts and Cham are asking for $50,000 and $30,000, respectively. The complaints are currently in the process of being filed on behalf of the individuals by the CRARR.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Block, "Black Montreal Residents claim racial profiling on transit," Montreal Gazette. 21 Feb 2010 https://montrealgazette.com/life/Black+Montreal+residents+claim+racial+profiling+transit/2594810/story.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''iii. Past Successes'''&lt;br /&gt;
The CRARR has been granted [[intervention (law)|intervener]] status in two discrimination cases reviewed by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. One was [[Lavoie v. Canada]] (2002) which discussed giving preference to citizens over non-citizens for government jobs. As intervener, the CRARR argued that the practice was discriminatory and "the preference operated in a particularly invidious way with respect to women."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25532">A '''cognitive model''' is an approximation to animal [[cognition|cognitive processes]] (predominantly human) for the purposes of comprehension and prediction. Cognitive models can be developed within or without a [[cognitive architecture]], though the two are not always easily distinguishable.

In contrast to cognitive architectures, cognitive models tend to be focused on a single cognitive phenomenon or process (e.g. list learning), how two or more processes interact (e.g. visual search and decision making), or to make behavioral predictions for a specific task or tool (e.g. how instituting a new software package will affect productivity). Cognitive architectures tend to be focused on the structural properties of the modeled system, and help constrain the development of cognitive models within the architecture. Likewise, model development helps to inform limitations and shortcomings of the architecture. Some of the most popular architectures for cognitive modeling include [[ACT-R]], [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|Clarion]], and [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]].

==History==
Cognitive modeling historically developed within [[cognitive psychology]]/[[cognitive science]] (including [[human factors]]), and has received contributions from the fields of [[machine learning]] and [[artificial intelligence]] to name a few. There are many types of cognitive models, and they can range from box-and-arrow diagrams to a set of equations to software programs that interact with the same tools that humans use to complete tasks (e.g., computer mouse and keyboard)&lt;ref&gt; Sun, R. (ed.), (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Box-and-arrow models==
A number of key terms are used to describe the processes involved in the perception, storage, and production of speech. Typically, they are used by speech pathologists while treating a child patient. The input signal is the speech signal heard by the child, usually assumed to come from an adult speaker. The output signal is the utterance produced by the child. The unseen psychological events that occur between the arrival of an input signal and the production of speech are the focus of psycholinguistic models. Events that process the input signal are referred to as input processes, whereas events that process the production of speech are referred to as output processes. Some aspects of speech processing are thought to happen online—that is, they occur during the actual perception
or production of speech and thus require a share of the attentional resources dedicated to the speech task. Other processes, thought to happen offline, take place as part of the child's background mental processing rather than during the time dedicated to the speech task.
In this sense, online processing is sometimes defined as occurring in real-time, whereas offline processing is said to be time-free (Hewlett, 1990). In box-and-arrow psycholinguistic models, each hypothesized level of representation or processing can be represented in a diagram by a “box,” and the relationships between them by “arrows,” hence the name. Sometimes (as in the models of Smith, 1973, and Menn, 1978, described later in this paper) the arrows represent processes additional to those shown in boxes. Such models make explicit the hypothesized information-
processing activities carried out in a particular cognitive function (such as language), in a manner analogous to computer flowcharts that depict the processes and decisions carried out by a computer program. Box-and-arrow models differ widely in the number of unseen psychological processes they describe and thus in the number of boxes they contain. Some have only one or two boxes between the input and output signals (e.g., Menn, 1978; Smith, 1973), whereas others have multiple boxes representing complex relationships between a number of different information-processing events (e.g., Hewlett, 1990; Hewlett, Gibbon, &amp; Cohen- McKenzie,1998; Stackhouse &amp; Wells, 1997). The most important box, however, and the source of much ongoing debate, is that representing the underlying representation (or UR). In essence, an underlying representation captures information stored in a child's mind about a word he or she knows and uses. As the following description of several models will illustrate, the nature of this information and thus the type(s) of representation present in the child's knowledge base have captured the attention of researchers for some time. (Elise Baker et al. Psycholinguistic Models of Speech Development and Their Application to Clinical Practice. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research. June 2001. 44. p 685–702.)

==Computational models==
A [[computational model]] is a mathematical model in [[computational science]] that requires extensive computational resources to study the behavior of a complex system by computer simulation. The system under study is often a complex nonlinear system for which simple, intuitive analytical solutions are not readily available. Rather than deriving a mathematical analytical solution to the problem, experimentation with the model is done by changing the parameters of the system in the computer, and studying the differences in the outcome of the experiments. Theories of operation of the model can be derived/deduced from these computational experiments.
Examples of common computational models are weather forecasting models, earth simulator models, flight simulator models, molecular protein folding models, and neural network models.

===Hybrid===
Hybrid computers are computers that exhibit features of analog computers and digital computers. The digital component normally serves as the controller and provides logical operations, while the analog component normally serves as a solver of differential equations.

==Dynamical systems==
In the traditional [[Computer Simulation|computational approach]], [[Mental representation|representations]] are viewed as static structures of discrete [[Symbolic system|symbols]]. [[Cognition]] takes place by transforming static symbol structures in [[Discrete time|discrete]], sequential steps. [[Sensory system|Sensory]] information is transformed into symbolic inputs, which produce symbolic outputs that get transformed into [[Motor system|motor]] outputs. The entire system operates in an ongoing cycle.

What is missing from this traditional view is that human cognition happens [[Continuous function|continuously]] and in real time. Breaking down the processes into discrete time steps may not fully [[Mathematical model|capture]] this behavior. An alternative approach is to define a system with (1) a state of the system at any given time, (2) a behavior, defined as the change over time in overall state, and (3) a state set or [[State space (dynamical system)|state space]], representing the totality of overall states the system could be in.&lt;ref&gt;van Gelder, T. (1998). [https://static.cambridge.org/resource/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20170214115306027-0503:S0140525X98311735:S0140525X9800173Xa.pdf The dynamical hypothesis in cognitive science]. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, 615-665.&lt;/ref&gt; The system is distinguished by the fact that all of these states belong together. A change in any aspect of the system depends on other aspects of the system.&lt;ref&gt;van Gelder, T. &amp; Port, R. F. (1995). [http://cogsci.ucd.ie/connectionism/Articles/vanGelderPort.pdf It's about time: An overview of the dynamical Approach to cognition]. In R.F. Port and T. van Gelder (Eds.), Mind as motion: Explorations in the Dynamics of Cognition. (pp. 1-43). Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical [[Dynamical system|dynamical]] model is [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalized]] by several [[differential equation]]s that describe how the system's state changes over time.  By doing so, the form of the space of possible [[Orbit (dynamics)|trajectories]] and the internal and external forces that shape a specific trajectory that unfold over time, instead of the physical nature of the underlying [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] that manifest this dynamics, carry explanatory force. On this dynamical view, parametric inputs alter the system's intrinsic dynamics, rather than specifying an internal state that describes some external state of affairs.

===Early dynamical systems===

====Associative memory====
Early work in the application of dynamical systems to cognition can be found in the model of [[Hopfield network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfield, J. J. (1982). [http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/79/8/2554.full.pdf Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities]. PNAS, 79, 2554-2558.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hopfield, J. J. (1984). [http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/81/10/3088.full.pdf Neurons with graded response have collective computational properties like those of two-state neurons]. PNAS, 81, 3088-3092.&lt;/ref&gt; These networks were proposed as a model for [[associative memory (psychology)|associative memory]]. They represent the neural level of [[memory]], modeling systems of around 30 neurons which can be in either an on or off state.  By letting the [[Neural network|network]] learn on its own, structure and computational properties naturally arise. Unlike previous models, “memories” can be formed and recalled by inputting a small portion of the entire memory. Time ordering of memories can also be encoded. The behavior of the system is modeled with [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] which can change values, representing different states of the system. This early model was a major step toward a dynamical systems view of human cognition, though many details had yet to be added and more phenomena accounted for.

==== Language acquisition====
By taking into account the [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evolutionary development]] of the human [[nervous system]] and the similarity of the [[brain]] to other organs, [[Jeffrey Elman|Elman]] proposed that [[language]] and cognition should be treated as a dynamical system rather than a digital symbol processor.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, J. L. (1995). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.50.7356&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Language as a dynamical system]. In R.F. Port and T. van Gelder (Eds.), Mind as motion: Explorations in the Dynamics of Cognition. (pp. 195-223). Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neural networks of the type Elman implemented have come to be known as [[Recurrent neural networks|Elman networks]].  Instead of treating language as a collection of static [[Lexicon|lexical]] items and [[grammar]] rules that are learned and then used according to fixed rules, the dynamical systems view defines the [[lexicon]] as regions of state space within a dynamical system. Grammar is made up of [[attractor]]s and repellers that constrain movement in the state space. This means that representations are sensitive to context, with mental representations viewed as trajectories through mental space instead of objects that are constructed and remain static. Elman networks were trained with simple sentences to represent grammar as a dynamical system. Once a basic grammar had been learned, the networks could then parse complex sentences by predicting which words would appear next according to the dynamical model.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, J. L. (1991). [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00114844.pdf Distributed representations, simple recurrent networks, and grammatical structure]. Machine Learning, 7, 195-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cognitive development====
A classic developmental error has been investigated in the context of dynamical systems:&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, J. P., Smith, L. B., &amp; Thelen, E. (2001). Tests of dynamical systems account of the A-not-B error: The influence of prior experience on the spatial memory abilities of two-year-olds. Child Development, 72(5), 1327-1346.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thelen"&gt;Thelen E., Schoner, G., Scheier, C., Smith, L. B. (2001). [https://static.cambridge.org/resource/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20170214114618504-0222:S0140525X01223917:S0140525X01003910a.pdf The dynamics of embodiment: A field theory of infant preservative reaching]. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 24, 1-86.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[A-not-B error]] is proposed to be not a distinct error occurring at a specific age (8 to 10 months), but a feature of a dynamic learning process that is also present in older children. Children 2 years old were found to make an error similar to the A-not-B error when searching for toys hidden in a sandbox. After observing the toy being hidden in location A and repeatedly searching for it there, the 2-year-olds were shown a toy hidden in a new location B. When they looked for the toy, they searched in locations that were biased toward location A. This suggests that there is an ongoing representation of the toy's location that changes over time. The child's past behavior influences its model of locations of the sandbox, and so an account of behavior and learning must take into account how the system of the sandbox and the child's past actions is changing over time.&lt;ref name="Thelen" /&gt;

====Locomotion====
One proposed mechanism of a dynamical system comes from analysis of continuous-time [[recurrent neural networks]] (CTRNNs).  By focusing on the output of the neural networks rather than their states and examining fully interconnected networks, three-neuron [[central pattern generator]] (CPG) can be used to represent systems such as leg movements during walking.&lt;ref&gt;Chiel, H. J., Beer, R. D., &amp; Gallagher, J. C. (1999). Evolution and analysis of model CPGs for walking. Journal of Computational Neuroscience, 7, 99-118.&lt;/ref&gt; This CPG contains three [[motor neuron]]s to control the foot, backward swing, and forward swing effectors of the leg. Outputs of the network represent whether the foot is up or down and how much force is being applied to generate [[torque]] in the leg joint. One feature of this pattern is that neuron outputs are either [[Binary number|off or on]] most of the time. Another feature is that the states are quasi-stable, meaning that they will eventually transition to other states. A simple pattern generator circuit like this is proposed to be a building block for a dynamical system. Sets of neurons that simultaneously transition from one quasi-stable state to another are defined as a dynamic module. These modules can in theory be combined to create larger circuits that comprise a complete dynamical system. However, the details of how this combination could occur are not fully worked out.

===Modern dynamical systems===

====Behavioral dynamics====
Modern formalizations of dynamical systems applied to the study of cognition vary. One such formalization, referred to as “behavioral dynamics”,&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;Warren, W. H. (2006). [http://rci.rutgers.edu/~persci/speakers/Warren_P%26A_PR06.pdf The dynamics of perception and action]. Psychological Review, 113(2), 359-389. doi: 10.1037/0033-295X.113.2.358&lt;/ref&gt; treats the [[Intelligent agent|agent]] and the environment as a pair of [[Coupling (physics)|coupled]] dynamical systems based on classical dynamical systems theory.  In this formalization, the information from the [[Environment (systems)|environment]] informs the agent's behavior and the agent's actions modify the environment. In the specific case of [[Motor cognition|perception-action cycles]], the coupling of the environment and the agent is formalized by two [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].  The first transforms the representation of the agents action into specific patterns of muscle activation that in turn produce forces in the environment.  The second function transforms the information from the environment (i.e., patterns of stimulation at the agent's receptors that reflect the environment's current state) into a representation that is useful for controlling the agents actions.  Other similar dynamical systems have been proposed (although not developed into a formal framework) in which the agent's nervous systems, the agent's body, and the environment are coupled together&lt;ref&gt;Beer, R. D. (2000). Dynamical approaches to cognitive science.  Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4(3), 91-99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beer, R. D. (2003). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.120.3706&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf The dynamics of active categorical perception in an evolved model agent]. Adaptive Behavior, 11(4), 209-243. doi: 10.1177/1059712303114001&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Adaptive behaviors=====
Behavioral dynamics have been applied to locomotive behavior.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fajen, B., R., &amp; Warren, W. H. (2003). [http://www.rc.unesp.br/ib/e_fisica/aplab/obstacle%20avoidance.pdf Behavioral dynamics of steering, obstacle avoidance, and route selection]. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 29, 343-362.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fajen, B. R., Warren, W. H., Temizer, S., &amp; Kaelbling, L. P. (2003). [http://cs.ait.ac.th/~mdailey/cvreadings/Fajen-Dynamical.pdf A dynamical model of visually-guided steering, obstacle avoidance, and route selection]. International Journal of Computer Vision, 54, 15-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modeling locomotion with behavioral dynamics demonstrates that adaptive behaviors could arise from the interactions of an agent and the environment.  According to this framework, adaptive behaviors can be captured by two levels of analysis.  At the first level of perception and action, an agent and an environment can be conceptualized as a pair of dynamical systems coupled together by the forces the agent applies to the environment and by the structured information provided by the environment.  Thus, behavioral dynamics emerge from the agent-environment interaction.  At the second level of time evolution,  behavior can be expressed as a dynamical system represented as a vector field. In this vector field, attractors reflect stable behavioral solutions, where as bifurcations reflect changes in behavior.  In contrast to previous work on central pattern generators, this framework suggests that stable behavioral patterns are an emergent, self-organizing property of the agent-environment system rather than determined by the structure of either the agent or the environment.

====Open dynamical systems====
In an extension of classical [[dynamical systems theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Hotton, S., &amp; Yoshimi, J. (2010). The dynamics of embodied cognition. International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 20(4), 943-972. doi: 10.1142/S0218127410026241&lt;/ref&gt; rather than coupling the environment's and the agent's dynamical systems to each other, an “open dynamical system” defines a “total system”, an “agent system”, and a mechanism to relate these two systems.  The total system is a dynamical system that models an agent in an environment, whereas the agent system is a dynamical system that models an agent's intrinsic dynamics (i.e., the agent's dynamics in the absence of an environment).  Importantly, the relation mechanism does not couple the two systems together, but rather continuously modifies the total system into the decoupled agent's total system. By distinguishing between total and agent systems, it is possible to investigate an agent's behavior when it is isolated from the environment and when it is embedded within an environment.  This formalization can be seen as a generalization from the classical formalization, whereby the agent system can be viewed as the agent system in an open dynamical system, and the agent coupled to the environment and the environment can be viewed as the total system in an open dynamical system.

=====Embodied cognition=====
In the context of dynamical systems and [[embodied cognition]], representations can be conceptualized as indicators or mediators.  In the indicator view, internal states carry information about the existence of an object in the environment, where the state of a system during exposure to an object is the representation of that object.  In the mediator view, internal states carry information about the environment which is used by the system in obtaining its goals. In this more complex account, the states of the system carries information that mediates between the information the agent takes in from the environment, and the force exerted on the environment by the agents behavior.  The application of open dynamical systems have been discussed for four types of classical embodied cognition examples:&lt;ref&gt;Hotton, S., &amp; Yoshimi, J. (2011). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01151.x Extending dynamical systems theory to model embodied cognition]. Cognitive Science, 35, 444-479. doi: 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01151.x&lt;/ref&gt;   
# Instances where the environment and agent must work together to achieve a goal, referred to as "intimacy". A classic example of intimacy is the behavior of simple agents working to achieve a goal (e.g., insects traversing the environment).  The successful completion of the goal relies fully on the coupling of the agent to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Haugeland, J. (1996). [https://philpapers.org/rec/HAUMEA Mind embodied and embedded]. In J. Haugeland (Ed.), Having thought: Essays in the metaphysics of mind (pp. 207-237). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Instances where the use of external artifacts improves the performance of tasks relative to performance without these artifacts. The process is referred to as "offloading".  A classic example of offloading is the behavior of [[Scrabble]] players; people are able to create more words when playing Scrabble if they have the tiles in front of them and are allowed to physically manipulate their arrangement.  In this example, the Scrabble tiles allow the agent to offload [[working memory]] demands on to the tiles themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Maglio, P., Matlock, T., Raphaely, D., Chernickym B., &amp; Kirsh, D. (1999). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Kirsh/publication/2518995_Interactive_Skill_in_Scrabble/links/0912f51230e9fea0bb000000/Interactive-Skill-in-Scrabble.pdf Interactive skill in scrabble]. In M. Hahn &amp; S. C. Stoness (Eds.), Proceedings of twenty-first annual conference of the Cognitive Science Society, (pp. 326-330). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Instances where a functionally equivalent external artifact replaces functions that are normally performed internally by the agent, which is a special case of offloading.  One famous example is that of human (specifically the agents Otto and Inga) navigation in a complex environment with or without assistance of an artifact.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, A., &amp; Chalmers, D. (1998). [https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/1312/TheExtendedMind.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y The extended mind]. Analysis, 58(1), 7-19.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Instances where there is not a single agent. The individual agent is part of larger system that contains multiple agents and multiple artifacts. One famous example, formulated by [[Edwin Hutchins|Ed Hutchins]] in his book ''Cognition in the Wild'', is that of navigating a naval ship.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, E., (1995). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CGIaNc3F1MgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cognition in the wild]. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
The interpretations of these examples rely on the following [[Reason|logic]]: (1) the total system captures embodiment; (2) one or more agent systems capture the intrinsic dynamics of individual agents; (3) the complete behavior of an agent can be understood as a change to the agent's intrinsic dynamics in relation to its situation in the environment; and (4) the paths of an open dynamical system can be interpreted as representational processes.  These embodied cognition examples show the importance of studying the emergent dynamics of an agent-environment systems, as well as the intrinsic dynamics of agent systems.  Rather than being at odds with traditional cognitive science approaches, dynamical systems are a natural extension of these methods and should be studied in parallel rather than in competition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1610">The '''Composition of Causes''' was a set of [[philosophy|philosophical]] laws advanced by [[John Stuart Mill]] in his watershed essay ''[[A System of Logic]]''. These laws outlined Mill's view of the [[epistemological]] components of [[emergentism]], a school of philosophical laws that posited a decidedly opportunistic approach to the classic dilemma of [[causation nullification]]. 

Mill was determined to prove that the intrinsic properties of all things relied on three primary tenets, which he called the Composition of Causes. These were:

1. The Cause of Inherent Efficiency, a methodological understanding of deterministic forces engaged in the perpetual axes of the soul, as it pertained to its own self-awareness.

2. The so-called Sixth Cause, a conceptual notion embodied by the system of inter-related segments of social and elemental vitra. This was a hotly debated matter in early 17th-century philosophical circles, especially in the halls of the Reichtaven in [[Meins]], where the spirit of Geudl still lingered.

3. The Cause of Multitude, an evolutionary step taken from Hemmlich's Plurality of a Dysfunctional Enterprise, detailing the necessary linkage between both sets of perception-based self-awareness.

Furthermore, the Composition of Causes elevated Mill's standing in [[ontological]] circles, lauded by his contemporaries for applying a conceptual vision of an often-argued discipline.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9988">The '''Creative Energy Homes'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/creative-energy-homes/index.aspx|publisher=The University of Nottingham|title=Creative Energy Homes project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (CEH) project is a showcase of innovative state-of-the-art energy-efficient homes of the future. Seven homes constructed on the [[Campuses of the University of Nottingham#University Park Campus|University Park Campus]] of the [[University of Nottingham]] are being designed and constructed to various degrees of innovation and flexibility to allow the testing of different aspects of modern methods of construction including layout and form, cladding materials, roof structures, foundations, glazing materials, thermal performance, building services systems, sustainable/[[renewable energy]] technologies, lighting systems, acoustics and water supply. The project aims to stimulate sustainable design ideas and promote new ways of providing affordable, environmentally sustainable housing that are innovative in their design. The homes are fully instrumented and occupied in order to provide comprehensive post occupancy evaluation data.

== The David Wilson House ==
[[File:CEH DavidWilsonHouse.jpg|thumb|left|The David Wilson Ecohouse]] Construction of the CEH project began in 1999 with the David Wilson Ecohouse.
This is a 4-bedroom detached property which uses brick and block construction. Its main purpose was to support research into domestic-sized renewable energy systems such as micro-CHP ([[Combined heat and power]]), [[solar thermal]], micro-wind, [[Light tube|sun pipes]], and natural ventilation devices.

The house is currently used as office space for University of Nottingham staff and continues to be used as a test bed for University research projects.

== The BASF House ==
The [http://www.house.basf.co.uk/ BASF house] was the 3rd house to be constructed and was completed in January 2008 taking only 25 weeks to build. The house was designed by Derek Trowell Architects [http://derektrowellarchitects.co.uk/basf-house/] to demonstrate that it is possible to build an affordable low energy house whilst still adherering to the [[Passivhaus]] ideology. It meets the level 4 standard of the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]].

The house has a compact floor area and relies as much as possible on passive solar design to keep costs down. The north, east and west walls are highly insulated, with the minimum number of openings compatible with acceptable day lighting standards. The southern elevation consists of a fully glazed two-layer adjustable sunspace with glazed screens that can be opened or closed to facilitate heating or cooling.

A [[Ground-coupled heat exchanger|ground-air heat exchanger]], supplied by [http://www.rehau.co.uk/ Rehau], lies to the front of the house and this consists of a network of horizontal pipes buried approximately 2m underground. At this depth the soil temperature only varies between 8-12°C throughout the year. Therefore in winter cold air can be pre-heated before being drawn into the house and in the summer the air can be cooled.

A [[rainwater harvesting]] system has also been installed, which consists of a 3500 litres tank buried under the car parking space. It collects the run-off water from the roof. This water can be used for washing clothes, watering the garden, flushing the toilet and general cleaning. Water efficiency is also an important factor of the code for sustainable homes and using a rainwater harvesting system drastically reduces the amount of mains water used per person per day.

The [[Passive solar building design|sun space]], at the front of the house captures the solar gain from the sun, heating the air for use in the rest of the house. The south facing elevation is almost 100% glazed and the north facing elevation 30% glazed, providing improved quality of life in the home by maximising the use of natural daylight and reducing the energy required to light the home.

On the roof of the house are 3 solar thermal panels used for hot water heating. This is a larger system than is typical for this size of house, which allows storage of hot water for as long as 3 days and helps compensate for extended periods of overcast conditions.

== The E.ON 2016 House ==
The [http://www.eon-uk.com/about/2016house.aspx E.ON House] is a replica 1930s UK semi-detached house built primarily to research the impact of various retrofitting solutions on the existing housing stock.

According to the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]] (CfSH) all the new houses built from 2016 are required to meet Level 6 requirements of the CfSH, or be carbon zero. However, it is estimated that by the year 2050, 25 million existing UK homes will still account for between 70 and 90 percent of the housing stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Existing Housing and Climate Change|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmcomloc/432/432i.pdf|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 25% of UK CO2 emissions derive from the domestic housing stock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Firth|first=Steven|title=Investigating CO2 emissions reduction in existing urban housing using a community domestic energy model|url=http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_2098_2105.pdf|work=Proceedings of the Eleventh International IBPSA Conference|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; so clearly there is a large opportunity to reduce UK carbon emissions by increasing the efficiency of existing homes.

The house is built to 1930s building regulations and the project developers had to receive special planning permission in order to construct the house. It has no roof or wall cavity insulation and uses single glazed windows. Hot water is provided by an outdated, inefficient non-condensing gas boiler and immersion heater. The plan is to bring this 1930s house to a top of the range home meeting Level 6 CfSH. It is hoped that the lessons learnt from this detailed research will help point the way to retrofitting homes to create more sustainable properties. The project consists of three phases:

# During the first phase the house was monitored in its original state. There are over 100 sensors positioned around the house monitoring temperature, relative humidity, electricity consumption of individual appliances, gas consumption, water consumption, total electricity consumption and occupancy.
# The second phase was carried out from August 2010 to June 2011. The building was upgraded with additional insulation, an improved heating system, double glazing, more efficient lighting and drought proofing. Research was carried out as to the impact of these improvements.
# In the third phase, due to begin in late 2011, further improvements will be made incorporating the installation of a conservatory-style extension creating a buffer zone between the property and the outside elements and a sun space to maximise solar gain. Renewable energy technologies, such as [[Photovoltaic panels|Solar panel]]  and solar hot water system will also be installed in order to supply the house with electricity and hot water.

== The Tarmac Homes ==
Tarmac have sponsored the construction of two semi-detached eco-homes called [http://www.tarmachomesproject.co.uk/ Tarmac House]. These are designed by [http://www.zedfactory.com/ ZEDfactory], the company responsible for the [[BEDZED]] project in south London. One home is built to Level 4 CfSH  and the other to Level 6 CfSH.

These houses demonstrate that it is possible to build a sustainable home using currently available materials and traditional methods of construction. Sustainability features of the properties include:

* Extremely well insulated walls with 250&amp;nbsp;mm of [[cavity wall insulation]].
* A [[Biomass heating system]] situated in front of the houses.
* A [[Solar water heating]] system with roof-mounted solar panels.
* [http://solarcentury.com/ Solar century] sun slates on the level 6 house helping to meet electricity demands.

== The Nottingham H.O.U.S.E (Home Optimising the Use of Solar Energy) ==
[http://www.nottinghamhouse.co.uk/ Nottingham H.O.U.S.E] is a small family "starter" home, which was built as a part of a [[Solar Decathlon Europe]] 2010 event by the students of the [http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/Departments/abe/index.aspx Department of Architecture and Built Environment]. The house delivers a zero carbon sustainable design solution that is compliant with level 6 of UK's Code for Sustainable Homes. It is a prefabricated two storey house with a courtyard garden that can be used in terrace or semi-detached form.

The House was presented at the [http://www.ecobuild.co.uk/ Ecobuild] 2010 event and awarded with the prize for the best use of timber. The models of the house were also presented at the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai Expo 2010]]. The prefabricated house is due to be moved on to the University Park campus of the University of Nottingham in the near future.

== The Mark Group House ==
The Mark Group house is currently under construction.  It is a 4-bedroom property constructed using a steel framing system with insulation cladding. Construction of the basement uses an [[Insulating concrete form|Insulating Concrete Form]] (ICF) which incorporates [[Ground granulated blast furnace slag|Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag]] (GGBS) into the [[Portland cement]].

Manufacturing Portland cement produces around 1 tonne of CO2 per tonne of concrete whereas GGBS, as a by-product of the iron industry, produces only 0.1 tonnes of CO2 per tonne{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. GGBS can be mixed with Portland cement 70%-30% to decrease its carbon footprint by around 40%{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3232">'''Dawson casting''' is an observed [[Bandwagon effect|cultural phenomenon]] and [[Trope (cinema)|movie trope]] in [[film]] and [[television]] where many of the actors appear, and in reality are, much older than the characters they are portraying. The concept is observable in [[teen drama]]s such as ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', and ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'' where grown adults are cast to play teenage characters.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite web|title=When adult actors play teenagers|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-28687403|publisher=BBC News|date=7 August 2014|author=Harry Low|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fsr"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Why Teenagers Need to Play Teenagers on Screen|url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/why-teenagers-need-to-play-teenagers-on-screen-40c659381a8/|author=Samantha Wilson|date=9 May 2014|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="screenrant"&gt;{{cite web|title=15 Older Actors Who Played Teenagers In TV And Movies|url=https://screenrant.com/older-actors-playing-teenagers-movies-tv/|publisher=Screenrant.com|author=Katherine Webb|date=8 June 2016|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside the Phenomenon of Grown Adults Playing Teenagers on TV|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/evgzvj/inside-the-phenomenon-of-grown-adults-playing-teenagers-on-tv|publisher=VICE|author=Linda Yang|date=5 May 2017|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally circulated on the Internet in response to the casting choices in ''[[Dawson's Creek]]''.&lt;ref name=vice /&gt;&lt;ref name="tvtropes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dawson Casting|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting|publisher=TvTropes|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social ramifications==
It has been suggested on several occasions by critics that Dawson casting has several negative implications, specifically for adolescents. These commonly include accusations of [[Physical attractiveness|unrealistic beauty standards]], negative [[body image]], low [[self-esteem]], and general [[Mental disorder|mental health problems]], especially in regards to one's self-perception.&lt;ref name="fsr"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="teenvogue"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Problem With Teen Characters Being Played by Adults|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/problem-teen-characters-played-by-adults|publisher=TeenVogue.com|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clinical psychologist, Barbara Greenberg, told ''[[Teen Vogue]]'' that casting twenty-year-old actors for the roles of high-school students can worsen the struggles of adolescents, stating "It can give the message that they’re supposed to look good all the time" adding "That leads to all kinds of body-image and social-comparison issues".&lt;ref name="teenvogue"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*In an episode of ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', Jack acknowledges the phenomenon when he exclaims "This is just like ''[[The O.C.]]'', except without 25-year-old teenagers and 35-year-old parents".&lt;ref name="tvtropes" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15307">A '''declaration of incompatibility''' is a declaration issued by a United Kingdom judge that a statute is incompatible with the [[European Convention of Human Rights]] under the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] section 4. This is a central part of [[UK constitutional law]]. Very few declarations of incompatibility have been issued, in comparison to the number of challenges.
{{See also|Sections 4 and 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998}}

==Human Rights in the UK==
[[Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998|Section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998]] reads as follows: "So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights". Where the court determines a piece of legislation is inconsistent with the Convention rights, the court can issue a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/section/4 Copy of section 4] of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], from [[Legislation.gov.uk]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the declaration of incompatibility is often seen as a last resort as the judiciary will attempt to interpret primary legislation as being compatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alexanderharris.co.uk/page/An_Introduction_to_the_Human_Rights_Acts_1998_122.asp|title=An Introduction to the Human Rights Acts 1998 - Alexander Harris Solicitors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a declaration will only be issued if such a reading is not possible. 

Once the court has issued a declaration of incompatibility, the law remains the same until [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] removes the incompatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200607/jtselect/jtrights/128/12807.htm|title=Joint Committee On Human Rights - Sixteenth Report|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Lords/Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts must still apply the legislation as it is and the parties to the actual case are unaffected by the declaration. Hence, the declaration has no actual legal effect and the parties neither gain nor lose by it. A declaration of incompatibility is only the start of a remedy to a Human Rights Act 1998 claim. Section 8 of the Act enables the court to make any further remedy it sees fit.

In England and Wales, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], [[Court of Appeal]], [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], and the [[Courts Martial Appeal Court]] can issue declarations of incompatibility. In Scotland, in addition to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], the [[Court of Session]] and the [[High Court of Justiciary]] are also able to issue declarations of incompatibility. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/peoples-rights/human-rights/pdf/act-studyguide.pdf|title=Justice.gov.uk|first=Ministry of|last=Justice|website=www.dca.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Ireland, the Northern Irish High Court or Court of Appeals can issue a statement of incompatibility for Acts of the Northern Irish Assembly &lt;ref&gt; Anthony, G. (2014). ''Judicial Review in Northern Ireland'', 2nd ed. Oxford: Hart Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

By section 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998, a "fast track" option of a remedial order (a type of [[statutory instrument]]) can be used by the ministers to amend non-compliant legislation which has been declared incompatible (except if it is a [[Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919|measure]] of the Church of England). As of 2016 this option has been used twice: in 2001 for the [[Mental Health Act 1983]], and in 2009 for the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]].

==List of cases==
{{Update section|date=September 2018}}
There had been 20 declarations of incompatibility by April 2013, with 8 having been overturned on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/documents/2013/incompatibilityHRA.pdf LSE Human Rights Futures Project, ''Declarations of Incompatibility under the Human Rights Act 1998'' (April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2016 there were two more declarations finalised, and four more subject to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ministry of Justice]], ''Responding to Human Rights judgments: Report to the Joint Committee on Human Rights on the Government’s response to Human Rights judgments 2014–16'' (November 2016) Annex A&lt;/ref&gt;

A dry drunk can be described as a person who refrains from alcohol or drugs, but still has all the unresolved emotional and psychological issues which might have fueled the addiction to begin with. These unresolved issues continue to have a hold on their psyche and hence, they act like "dry drunks."&lt;ref name="Bennett2011"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/heartache-hope/201105/is-there-dry-drunk-in-your-life|title=Is there a "Dry Drunk" in your life?|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-27 |first=Carole |last=Bennett |date=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, [[Alcohol dependence|alcohol dependancy]] is a substantial factor in the lives of the alcoholics and accepting sobriety comes with its own challenges and understanding of their personality. Despite leaving alcohol and de-addicting themselves, most of their personalities are an embodiment of their drunkard selves.&lt;ref name="Bennett2011" /&gt; 

The dry drunk is portrayed with feelings of profound depression and frustration and with the indecisive feeling of wanting a drink that they have given up. Several alcoholics drink for about 10-20 years before maintaining sobriety and get used to their personality and character traits that are embodied by their drunkard selves. During this phase of dry drunk, the addicts face restlessness, frustration, anger, impatience and craving. The symptoms of dry drunkenness are irregular and become less intense as the period of sobriety increases. Most of the symptoms of dry drunkenness can be noticed in the initial phase of sobriety.

'''Eros'''  ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪər|ɒ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛr|ɒ|s}}; {{lang-grc|ἔρως}} ''érōs'' "love" or "desire") is one of [[Greek words for love|the four ancient Greco-Christian terms]]  which can be rendered into English as "[[love]]". The other three are ''[[storge]]'', ''[[philia]]'', and ''[[agape]]''. ''Eros'' refers to "passionate love" or romantic love; ''storge'' to familial love; ''philia'' to friendship as a kind of love; and ''agape'' refers to "selfless love", or "[[charity (virtue)|charity]]" as it is translated in the Christian scriptures (from the Latin ''[[wikt:caritas|caritas]]'', dearness).&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Lewis, ''[[The Four Loves]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''[[erotic]]'' is derived from ''eros''. ''Eros'' has also been used in [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] in a much wider sense, almost as an equivalent to "life energy".

==In literature==

===The classical Greek tradition===
In the classical world, erotic love was generally referred to as a kind of madness or ''theia mania'' ("madness from the gods").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | doi =
  | id =
  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This love passion was described through an elaborate metaphoric and mythological [[schema (psychology)|schema]] involving "love's arrows" or "love darts", the source of which was often the personified figure of [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] (or his Latin counterpart, [[Cupid]]),&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' and the ''[[Heroides]]'' of [[Ovid]] which frequently refer to the overwhelming passion caused by Cupid's darts.&lt;/ref&gt; or another deity (such as [[Pheme|Rumor]]&lt;ref&gt;See Paris's letter to Helen of Troy, in Ovid, ''Heroides and Amores,'' XVI, 36-38.&lt;/ref&gt;). At times the source of the arrows was said to be the image of the beautiful love object itself. If these arrows were to arrive at the lover's eyes, they would then travel to and 'pierce' or 'wound' his or her heart and overwhelm him/her with desire and longing ([[lovesickness]]).  The image of the "arrow's wound" was sometimes used to create [[oxymoron]]s and rhetorical [[antithesis]] concerning its pleasure and pain.

"[[Love at first sight]]" was explained as a sudden and immediate beguiling of the lover through the action of these processes, but this was not the only mode of entering into passionate love in classical texts. At times the passion could occur after the initial meeting, as, for example, in [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]]'s letter to [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]] in Ovid's ''Heroides'': "That time I went to Eleusis... it was then most of all (though you had pleased me before) that piercing love lodged in my deepest bones."&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Heroides and Amores,'' translated by Grant Showerman.  Second edition revised by G.P. Goold.  Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986), IV, 67-70, p 49.  {{ISBN|0-674-99045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At times, the passion could even precede the first glimpse, as in [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]' letter to [[Helen of Troy]] in the same work, where Paris says that his love for Helen came upon him before he had set eyes on her: "...you were my heart's desire before you were known to me.  I beheld your features with my soul ere I saw them with my eyes; rumour, that told me of you, was the first to deal my wound."&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Heroides and Amores,'' translated by Grant Showerman, second edition revised by G.P. Goold (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986), XVI, 36-38, pp. 199-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether by "first sight" or by other routes, passionate love often had disastrous results according to the classical authors.  In the event that the loved one was cruel or uninterested, this desire was shown to drive the lover into a state of depression, causing lamentation and illness.  Occasionally, the loved one was depicted as an unwitting ensnarer of the lover, because of her sublime beauty—a "divine curse" which inspires men to kidnap her or try to rape her.&lt;ref&gt;For more on these tropes in the Ancient Greek novel, see Françoise Létoublon, ''Les Lieux communs du roman: Stéréotypes grecs d'aventure et d'amour'', Leiden: E.J.Brill, 1993.  {{ISBN|90-04-09724-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories in which unwitting men catch sight of the naked body of [[Artemis]] the huntress (and sometimes [[Aphrodite]]) lead to similar ravages (as in the tale of [[Actaeon]]).

===European literature===
The classical conception of love's arrows was developed further by the [[troubadour]] poets of [[Provence]] during the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], and became part of the European [[courtly love]] tradition. The role of a woman's eyes in eliciting erotic desire was particularly emphasized by the Provençal poets, as N.E. Griffin points out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to this description, love originates upon the eyes of the lady when encountered by those of her future lover.  The love thus generated is conveyed on bright beams of light from her eyes to his, through which it passes to take up its abode in his heart.
&lt;ref&gt;See the introduction by Nathaniel Edward Griffin to ''[[Il Filostrato|The Filostrato]]'' of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] (New York: Bilbo and Tannen, no date. {{ISBN|0-8196-0187-X}}), p.76, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In some medieval texts, the gaze of a beautiful woman is compared to the sight of a [[basilisk]]—a legendary reptile said to have the power to cause death with a single glance.

These images continued to be circulated and elaborated upon in the literature and iconography of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion of the scene of "love at first sight" in fiction, see [[Jean Rousset]], ''"Leurs yeux se rencontrèrent" : la scène de première vue dans le roman'', Paris: José Corti, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] for example, in his ''[[Il Filostrato]]'', mixes the tradition of Cupid's arrow with the Provençal emphasis on the eyes as the birthplace of love: "Nor did he ([[Troilus]]) who was so wise shortly before... perceive that Love with his darts dwelt within the rays of those lovely eyes... nor notice the arrow that sped to his heart."&lt;ref&gt;[[Giovanni Boccaccio]], ''[[Il Filostrato]]'', canto 1, strophe 29; translation by Nathaniel Edward Griffin and Arthur Beckwith Myrick, p. 147. According to Griffin: "In the description of the enamorment of Troilus is a singular blending of the Provençal conception of the eyes as the birthplace of love with the classical idea of the God of Love with his bows and quiver..." (ibid., p.77, note 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetorical antithesis between the pleasure and pain from love's dart continued through the 17th century, as for example, in these classically inspired images from [[The Fairy-Queen]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Love's a Sweet Passion, why does it torment?&lt;br&gt;If a Bitter, oh tell me whence comes my content?&lt;br&gt;Since I suffer with pleasure, why should I complain,&lt;br&gt;Or grieve at my Fate, when I know 'tis in vain?&lt;br&gt;Yet so pleasing the Pain is, so soft is the Dart,&lt;br&gt;That at once it both wounds me, and Tickles my Heart.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, "If Love's a Sweet Passion", from the libretto of [[Henry Purcell]]'s ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'', act 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In philosophy and psychology==

===Plato===
The ancient philosopher [[Plato]] developed an [[idealistic]] concept of eros which would prove to be very influential in modern times. In general, [[Plato]] did not consider physical attraction to be a necessary part of eros. "[[Platonic love]]" in this original sense can be attained by the intellectual purification of eros from carnal into ideal form. This process is examined in Plato's dialogue the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''. Plato argues there that eros is initially felt for a person, but with contemplation it can become an appreciation for the beauty within that person, or even an appreciation for beauty itself in an ideal sense. As Plato expresses it, eros can help the soul to "remember" beauty in its pure form. It follows from this, for Plato, that eros can contribute to an understanding of truth.

Eros, understood in this sense, differed considerably from the common meaning of the word in the Greek language of Plato's time. It also differed from the meaning of the word in contemporary literature and poetry. For Plato, eros is neither purely human nor purely divine: it is something intermediate which he calls a [[daimon]]. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Its main characteristic is permanent aspiration and desire. Even when it seems to give, eros continues to be a "desire to possess", but nevertheless it is different from a purely sensual love in being the love that tends towards the sublime. According to Plato, the gods do not love, because they do not experience desires, inasmuch as their desires are all satisfied. They can thus only be an object, not a subject of love (''Symposium'' 200-1). For this reason they do not have a direct relationship with man; it is only the mediation of eros that allows the connecting of a relationship (''Symposium'' 203). Eros is thus the way that leads man to divinity, but not vice versa.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Nevertheless, eros remains always, for Plato, an egocentric love: it tends toward conquering and possessing the object that represents a value for man. To love the good signifies to desire to possess it forever. Love is therefore always a desire for immortality.&lt;ref&gt;John Paul II, ''Man and Woman He Created Them: a theology of the body'', translated by Michael Waldstein (Boston: Pauline Books and Media), 47:1 (p.315), footnote 56. See also Anders Nygren, ''Agape and eros'', translated by Philip S. Watson (University of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paradoxically, for Plato, the object of eros does not have to be physically beautiful. This is because the object of eros is beauty, and the greatest beauty is eternal, whereas physical beauty is in no way eternal. However, if the lover achieves possession of the beloved's ''inner'' (i.e., ideal) beauty, his need for happiness will be fulfilled, because happiness is the experience of knowing that you are participating in the ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Plato. Symposium. 199c5-212c&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sigmund Freud{{anchor|Eros and Sigmund Freud}} ===
In [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychology]], eros, not to be confused with [[libido]], is not exclusively the sex drive, but our life force, the will to live. It is the desire to create life, and favors productivity and construction. In early psychoanalytic writings, instincts from the eros were opposed by forces from the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]. But in later psychoanalytic theory, eros is opposed by the destructive death instinct of [[death drive|Thanatos]] (death instinct or death drive).

In his 1925 paper "The Resistances to Psycho-Analysis",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1925). "The Resistances to Psycho-Analysis", in ''The Collected Papers of Sigmund Freud'', Vol. 5, p.163-74. (Tr. James Strachey.)&lt;/ref&gt; Freud explains that the psychoanalytic concept of sexual energy is more in line with the [[Plato]]nic view of eros, as expressed in the [[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]], than with the common use of the word "sex" as related primarily to genital activity. He also mentions the philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] as an influence. He then goes on to confront his adversaries for ignoring such great precursors and for tainting his whole theory of eros with a ''[[pansexual]]'' tendency. He finally writes that his theory naturally explains this collective misunderstanding as a predictable [[Resistance (psychology)|resistance]] to the acknowledgement of sexual activity in childhood.

However, F. M. Cornford finds the standpoints of Plato and of Freud to be "diametrically opposed" with regard to eros. In Plato, eros is a spiritual energy initially, which then "falls" downward; whereas in Freud eros is a physical energy which is "sublimated" upward.&lt;ref&gt;Cornford, F.M. (1950), "The Doctrine of Eros in Plato's Symposium", in ''The Unwritten Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Herbert Marcuse]] appropriated the Freudian concept of eros for his highly influential 1955 work ''[[Eros and Civilization]]''.

===Carl Jung===
In [[Carl Jung]]'s analytical psychology, the counterpart to eros is ''[[logos]]'', a Greek term for the principle of rationality. Jung considers logos to be a masculine principle, while eros is a feminine principle. According to Jung:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Woman's psychology is founded on the principle of ''Eros'', the great binder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling principle ascribed to man is ''Logos''. The concept of ''Eros'' could be expressed in modern terms as psychic relatedness, and that of ''Logos'' as objective interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Jung]], “Woman in Europe” (1927), in ''Collected Works'' vol. 10, paragraph 255; reprinted in ''Aspects of the Feminine'', Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 65, {{ISBN|0-7100-9522-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This [[gender]]ing of eros and logos is a consequence of Jung's theory of the [[Anima and animus|anima/animus syzygy]] of the human psyche. Syzygy refers to the split between male and female. According to Jung, this split is recapitulated in the unconscious mind by means of "contrasexual" (opposite-gendered) elements called the [[anima and animus|anima]] (in men) and the animus (in women). Thus men have an unconscious feminine principle, the "anima", which is characterized by feminine eros. The work of [[individuation#Carl Gustav Jung|individuation]] for men involves becoming conscious of the anima and learning to accept it as one's own, which entails accepting eros. This is necessary in order to see beyond the [[Psychological projection|projections]] that initially blind the conscious ego. "Taking back the projections" is a major task in the work of individuation, which involves owning and subjectivizing unconscious forces which are initially regarded as alien.&lt;ref&gt;For a critical perspective on this viewpoint, which also summarizes the Jungian position well, see James Hillman, ''The Dream and The Underworld'' (1979), p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, Jung's concept of eros is not dissimilar to the Platonic one. Eros is ultimately the desire for wholeness, and although it may initially take the form of passionate love, it is more truly a desire for "psychic relatedness", a desire for interconnection and interaction with other sentient beings. However, Jung was inconsistent, and he did sometimes use the word "eros" as a shorthand to designate sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Hopcke, ''A Guided Tour of the Collected Works of C.G. Jung'', Shambhala Books, 1999, p.45ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when watching a movie, a viewer may be angered by seeing the hero wronged by the villain, but this initial excitation may intensify the viewer's pleasure in witnessing the villain's punishment later. Thus, although the excitation from the original stimulus of seeing the hero wronged was cognitively accessed as anger, the excitation after the second stimulus of seeing the villain punished is [[cognition|cognitively]] assessed as pleasure, though part of the excitation from the second stimulus is residual from the first.

==The Origins of Excitation-Transfer Theory==

&lt;br /&gt;Dolf Zillmann began developing excitation-transfer theory in the late 1960s/ early 1970s, and through the start of the 21st century, Zillmann continued to refine it&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, J., &amp; Miron, D. (2003). Excitation-transfer theory. In J. Bryant, D. Roskos-Ewoldsen, &amp; J. Cantor (Eds.), Communication and emotion: &lt;br /&gt;Essays in honor of Dolf Zillmann (pp. 31-59). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; (Bryant &amp; Miron, 2003). Excitation-transfer theory is based largely on [[Clark Hull|Clark Hull's]] notion of residual excitation (i.e., [[drive theory]]) and Stanley Schachter's [[two factor theory of emotion]]. As Bryant and Miron (2003) stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Zillmann collapsed and connected Hull's drive theory and Schachter's two-factor theory, which posited an excitatory and a cognitive component of emotional states. In contrast to Hull's hypothesis that excitatory reactions "lose" their specificity under new stimulation, Schachter claimed that emotional [[arousal]] is nonspecific, and the individual cognitively assess the emotion he is experiencing for the purpose of behavioral guidance and adjustment. Zillmann adopted and modified Schacter's view on this.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, J., &amp; Miron, D. (2003). Excitation-transfer theory. In J. Bryant, D. Roskos-Ewoldsen, &amp; J. Cantor (Eds.), Communication and emotion: &lt;br /&gt;Essays in honor of Dolf Zillmann (pp. 31-59). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;(p. 35)
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
In other words, excitation-transfer theory is based on the assumption that excitation responses are, for the most part, ambiguous and are differentiated only by what emotions the brain assigns to them. As Zillmann (2006) stated, "Residual excitation from essentially any excited emotional reaction is capable of intensifying any other excited emotional reaction. The degree of intensification depends, of course, on the magnitude of residues prevailing at the time" &lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, D. (2006). Dramaturgy for emotions from fictional narration. In J. Bryant &amp; P. Vorderer (Eds.), Psychology of entertainment (pp. 215-&lt;br /&gt;238). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;223). Hence, excitation transfer theory helps to explain the fickleness of emotional arousal (i.e., how it is possible for fear to be transferred into relief, anger into delight, etc.), and how the reaction to one stimulus can intensify the reaction to another. 
&lt;br /&gt;Although excitation-transfer theory was based heavily on [[psychology]], [[psychophysiology]], and [[biochemistry]], it has been often applied to [[media influence|effects studies]] in the field of [[communication]] &lt;ref&gt;Bryant, J., &amp; Miron, D. (2003). Excitation-transfer theory. In J. Bryant, D. Roskos-Ewoldsen, &amp; J. Cantor (Eds.), Communication and emotion: &lt;br /&gt;Essays in honor of Dolf Zillmann (pp. 31-59). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;(Bryant &amp; Miron, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;31).  As Bryant and Miron explained, "Growing concern about the increasingly [[media violence research|violent media content]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s spurred debate over the possible effects of such content on the real-life behavior of media consumers" &lt;ref&gt;Bryant, J., &amp; Miron, D. (2003). Excitation-transfer theory. In J. Bryant, D. Roskos-Ewoldsen, &amp; J. Cantor (Eds.), Communication and emotion: &lt;br /&gt;Essays in honor of Dolf Zillmann (pp. 31-59). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;32). Eventually, excitation-transfer theory became one of the dominant theoretical underpinnings for predicting, [[Experiment|testing]], and explaining the effects of such [[mass media|media]] (e.g., violent movies/ television shows, pornography, music etc.). Zillmann (1971) stated that "Communication-produced excitation may serve to intensify or 'energize' post-exposure emotional states"&lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, D. (1971). Excitation transfer in communication-mediated aggressive behavior. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 7, 419-434. &lt;br /&gt; {{doi|10.1016/0022-1031(71)90075-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;431). However, excitation transfer is not limited to face-to-face [[communication stimuli]], but can occur from an array of stimuli, including [[mediated messages]]. Tannenbaum and Zillmann (1975) argued: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Most people probably do not consider arousal from media exposure to be pronounced enough to warrant any attention, and hence they do not expect it to affect their behavior. Dismissing such arousals as trivial, the individual will tend to attribute any accumulating residues not to the preceding communication events [which are, in this instance, mediated messages] but to the new stimulus situations in which he finds himself. Moreover, by virtue of their very "unreal" and symbolic (possibly-fantasy encouraging) content, communication messages are generally not related to the person's real and immediate problems and concerns. This should further encourage misattribution of accruing arousal and hence make the person all the more vulnerable to transfer effects in his postcommunication behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Tannenbaum, P. H., &amp; Zillmann, D. (1975). Emotional arousal in the facilitation of aggression through communication. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), &lt;br /&gt;Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 8, pp 149-192). New York: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; (p. 187)
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
In short, stimuli, whether they be in real-life, on a television or movie screen, or a combination of the two, can elicit excitation-transfers. Today, excitation-transfer theory remains a key component of the [[theoretical framework]] of studies focusing on communication and emotion.

'''Exploratory thought''' is an academic term used in the field of [[psychology]] to describe [[reasoning]] that neutrally considers multiple points of view and tries to anticipate all possible objections to, or flaws in, a particular position, with the goal of seeking truth. The opposite of exploratory thought is [[confirmatory thought]], which is reasoning designed to construct justification supporting a specific point of view.

Both terms were coined by social psychologist [[Jennifer Lerner]] and psychology professor [[Philip Tetlock]] in the 2002 book Emerging Perspectives in Judgment and Decision Making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=ed. by Sandra L.|title=Emerging perspectives on judgment and decision research|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Lerner and Tetlock say that when people expect to need to justify their position to external parties, and they already know those parties' views, they will tend to adopt a similar position to theirs, and then engage in confirmatory thought with the goal of bolstering their own credibility rather than reaching a good conclusion. However, if the external parties are overly aggressive or critical, people will disengage from thought altogether, and simply assert their personal opinions without justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=ed. by Sandra L.|title=Emerging perspectives on judgment and decision research|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4303">As introduced by [[Kurt Lewin]], '''genidentity''' is an ''existential relationship'' underlying the genesis of an object from one moment to the next. What we usually consider to be an object really consists of multiple entities, which are the phases of the object at various [[time]]s. Two objects are not identical because they have the same properties in common, but because one has developed from the other. 
Lewin introduced the concept in his 1922 [[Habilitationsschrift]] ''Der Begriff der Genese in Physik, Biologie und Entwicklungsgeschichte''. It is today perhaps the only surviving evidence of Lewin's influence on the philosophy of science. However, this concept never became an object of widespread discussion and debate in its own terms. Rather, it was extracted from its context by philosophers such as [[Rudolf Carnap]], Hans Hermes, [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Adolph Grünbaum]], and [[Bas van Fraassen]] who incorporated this concept into their own theories such as the [[topology of the universe]] or the axiomatization of [[mechanics]]. Lewin's idea was to compare and contrast the concept of genidentity in various branches of science, thereby laying bare the characteristic structure of each and making their classification possible in the first place. 

== Classification of Natural Sciences ==

In his thesis mentioned above, Lewin compares [[physics]] (in which he includes [[chemistry]]) and [[biology]] (which he divides into organic biology and [[evolutionary history of life]]). A comparison of this kind presupposes that it is possible to find equivalent notions in both sciences. According to Lewin, the concept of ''genidentity'' in the various sciences meets this requirement.

Lewin distinguishes between partial and total genidentity. This is due to the difficulty caused by parts of objects: for instance, an object might disintegrate into several pieces in the course of its development. As we follow such an object through time, only a small portion of it may remain. Lewin says that two objects existing at different times are partly genidentical if at least some part of the later object was present in the earlier object. By contrast, he says that two objects are totally genidentical if and only if at neither of the considered times there is any distinct object partially genidentical to one of the two objects concerned. 

Lewin also introduces the idea of viewing physical bodies as links in a so-called ''development chain''. According to this approach, between two totally genidentical objects there always exists, at any intermediate time, an object totally genidentical with each. Thus genidentity implies the existence of an entire infinite series of intermediate objects. In this Lewin sees an analogy between physical objects and [[real number]]s, as defined by so-called [[Dedekind cut]]s in the ordering of [[rational number]]s. 

Genidentity so defined is postulated to have various characteristics, such as symmetry, transitivity, density, and continuity. When reviewed in the light of contemporary standards of logical precision, it becomes clear that Lewin had the correct intuition, even though he did not have the benefit of a highly developed terminology of definition theory or modern day [[symbolic logic]]. 

However, genidentity has never been explicitly discussed in the experimental sciences. Rather, it has always been a basic assumption hovering in the background, tacitly assumed. The credit for having made these assumptions explicit for the first time doubtlessly belongs to Kurt Lewin, usually renowned for his psychological work in the field of [[Gestalt psychology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7376">[[File:Double torus illustration.png|thumb|A genus-2 surface]]

In [[mathematics]], '''genus''' (plural '''genera''') has a few different, but closely related, meanings. The most common concept, the genus of an (orientable) surface, is the number of "holes" it has. This is made more precise below.

==Topology==
===Orientable surface===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Complex plane]] --&gt;
[[File:Mug and Torus morph.gif|thumb|Donut or coffee cup?]]
The '''genus''' of a connected, [[orientability|orientable]] [[Surface (topology)|surface]] is an [[integer]] representing the maximum number of cuttings along non-intersecting closed simple [[curve]]s without rendering the resultant [[manifold]] disconnected.&lt;ref&gt;Munkres, James R. Topology. Vol. 2. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; It is equal to the number of [[Handle (mathematics)|handles]] on it. Alternatively, it can be defined in terms of the [[Euler characteristic]] ''χ'', via the relationship ''χ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2''g'' for closed surfaces, where ''g'' is the genus. For surfaces with ''b'' boundary components, the equation reads ''χ'' =&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2''g''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''. In layman's terms, it's the number of "holes" an object has ("holes" interpreted in the sense of doughnut holes; a hollow sphere would be considered as having zero holes in this sense). A doughnut, or torus, has 1 such hole. A sphere has 0. The green surface pictured above has 2 holes of the relevant sort.

For instance:
* The [[sphere]] '''''S''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;''' and a [[disk (mathematics)|disc]] both have genus zero.
* A [[torus]] has genus one, as does the surface of a coffee mug with a handle. This is the source of the joke that "topologists are people who can't tell their donut from their coffee mug."

An explicit construction of surfaces of genus ''g'' is given in the article on the [[fundamental polygon]].
&lt;gallery caption="Genus of orientable surfaces" widths="100px" heights="100px" perrow="6"&gt;
File:Sphere filled blue.svg|genus 0
File:Torus illustration.png|genus 1
File:Double torus illustration.png|genus 2
File:Triple torus illustration.png|genus 3
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In simpler terms, the value of an orientable surface's genus is equal to the number of "holes" it has.&lt;ref&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Genus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-orientable surfaces===
The '''[[orientability|non-orientable]] genus''', '''demigenus''', or '''Euler genus''' of a connected, non-orientable closed [[Surface (topology)|surface]] is a positive [[integer]] representing the number of [[cross-cap]]s attached to a [[sphere]]. Alternatively, it can be defined for a closed surface in terms of the [[Euler characteristic]] χ, via the relationship χ = 2 − ''k'', where ''k'' is the non-orientable genus.

For instance:
* A [[projective plane]] has non-orientable genus one.
* A [[Klein bottle]] has non-orientable genus two.

===Knot===
The '''[[genus of a knot|genus]]''' of a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] ''K'' is defined as the minimal genus of all [[Seifert surface]]s for ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Colin |last= Adams|author-link=Colin Adams (mathematician)|title=The Knot Book: An Elementary Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of Knots |publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|year=2004|isbn=0-8218-3678-1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Seifert surface of a knot is however a [[manifold with boundary]], the boundary being the knot, i.e.
homeomorphic to the unit circle. The genus of such a surface is defined to be the genus of the two-manifold, which is obtained by gluing the unit disk along the boundary.

===Handlebody===
The '''genus''' of a 3-dimensional [[handlebody]] is an integer representing the maximum number of cuttings along embedded [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] without rendering the resultant manifold disconnected. It is equal to the number of handles on it.

For instance:
* A [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] has genus zero.
* A solid torus ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; has genus one.

===Graph theory===
{{Main|Graph embedding}}
The '''genus''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is the minimal integer ''n'' such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with ''n'' handles (i.e. an oriented surface of genus ''n''). Thus, a [[planar graph]] has genus 0, because it can be drawn on a sphere without self-crossing.

The '''non-orientable genus''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is the minimal integer ''n'' such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with ''n'' cross-caps (i.e. a non-orientable surface of (non-orientable) genus ''n'').  (This number is also called the '''demigenus'''.)

The '''Euler genus''' is the minimal integer ''n'' such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with ''n'' cross-caps or on a sphere with ''n/2'' handles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Graphs on surfaces}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[topological graph theory]] there are several definitions of the genus of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]]. [[Arthur T. White]] introduced the following concept. The [[genus of a group]] ''G'' is the minimum genus of a (connected, undirected) [[Cayley graph]] for ''G''.

The [[Graph embedding#Computational complexity|graph genus problem]] is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Carsten |last1=Thomassen |title= The graph genus problem is NP-complete |journal= Journal of Algorithms |year=1989 |issue=4 |volume=10 |pages=568&amp;ndash;576 |issn=0196-6774 |doi=10.1016/0196-6774(89)90006-0 | zbl=0689.68071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algebraic geometry==
There are two related definitions of '''genus''' of any projective algebraic [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] ''X'': the [[arithmetic genus]] and the [[geometric genus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hirzebruch | first=Friedrich | authorlink=Friedrich Hirzebruch | title=Topological methods in algebraic geometry | others=Translation from the German and appendix one by R. L. E. Schwarzenberger. Appendix two by A. Borel | edition=Reprint of the 2nd, corr. print. of the 3rd | origyear=1978 | series=Classics in Mathematics | location=Berlin | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1995 | isbn=3-540-58663-6 | zbl=0843.14009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When ''X'' is an [[algebraic curve]] with field of definition the [[complex number]]s, and if ''X'' has no [[tangent space|singular points]], then these definitions agree and coincide with the topological definition applied to the [[Riemann surface]] of ''X'' (its [[manifold]] of complex points). For example, the definition of [[elliptic curve]] from algebraic geometry is ''connected non-singular projective curve of genus 1 with a given [[rational point]] on it''.

By the [[Riemann-Roch theorem#Applications|Riemann-Roch theorem]], an irreducible plane curve of degree ''d'' has geometric genus

:&lt;math&gt;g=\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}-s,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the number of singularities when properly counted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20333">The '''green gross domestic product''' ('''green GDP''' or '''GGDP''') is an index of [[economic growth]] with the environmental consequences of that growth factored into a country's conventional [[GDP]]. Green GDP monetizes the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], and accounts for costs caused by [[climate change]]. Some environmental experts prefer physical indicators (such as "[[waste]] [[per capita]]" or "[[carbon dioxide emissions]] per year"), which may be aggregated to indices such as the "[[Sustainable Development Index]]".

==Calculation==

Calculating green GDP requires that net [[natural capital]] consumption, including [[resource depletion]], [[environmental degradation]], and [[environmental protection|protective]] and [[environmental restoration|restorative]] environmental initiatives, be subtracted from traditional GDP.&lt;ref name="Fitoussi"&gt;Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi, [http://templatelab.com/rapport-anglais/ "Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress"], "Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress", 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some early calculations of green GDP take into account one or two but not all environmental adjustments. These calculations can also be applied to [[net domestic product]] (NDP), which deducts the depreciation of produced capital from GDP. In each case, it is necessary to convert the resource activity into a monetary value, since it is in this manner that indicators are generally expressed in national accounts.

==Rationale==

The motivation for creating a green GDP originates from the inherent limitations of GDP has as an indicator of [[economic performance]] and [[social progress]]. It only assesses gross output, and does not have a mechanism for identifying the wealth and assets that underlie output.&lt;ref name="WAVES"/&gt; This is problematic because it cannot account for permanent or significant depletion or replenishment of these assets. Ultimately, GDP has no capacity to identify whether the level of [[income]] generated in a country is [[sustainable]]. Richard Stone, one of the creators the original GDP indicator, suggested that while "the three pillars on which an analysis of society ought to rest are studies of economic, socio-[[demographic]] and environmental phenomenon", he had done little work in the area of [[environmental issues]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stone, [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1984/stone-lecture.pdf "The Accounts of Society"], "The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1984", 8 December 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, natural capital is poorly represented in GDP; resources are not adequately considered as economic assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/read/iwr-policy "Policy Recommendations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420075450/http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/read/iwr-policy |date=2013-04-20 }}, "International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change", 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Relative to their costs, companies and policy makers also do not give sufficient weight to the future benefits generated by restorative or protective environmental projects. As well, the important positive externalities that arise from forests, wetlands and agriculture are unaccounted for or otherwise hidden because of practical difficulties around measuring and pricing these assets.&lt;ref name="WAVES"&gt;[http://www.wavespartnership.org/waves/natural-capital-accounting?active=1 "Natural Capital Accounting"], "Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the impact that the [[depletion of natural resources]] or increases in [[pollution]] can and do have on the future productive capacity of a nation are unaccounted for in traditional GDP estimates.&lt;ref name="WAVES" /&gt;

The need for a more comprehensive macroeconomic indicator is consistent with the conception of sustainable development as a desirable phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sesric.org/files/article/52.pdf "Environmental Accounting for Sustainable Growth and Development with Special Reference to a System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA): The Indonesian Experience"], "Statistical, Economic and Social Research and Training Centre for Islamic Countries"&lt;/ref&gt; GDP is mistakenly appropriated as a primary indicator of well-being, and as a result, it is used heavily in the analysis of political and economic policy. Green GDP would arguably be a more accurate indicator or measure of societal well-being. Therefore, the integration of environmental statistics into national accounts, and by extension, the generation of a green GDP figure, would improve countries' abilities to manage their economies and resources.

==History==
Many economists, scientists and other scholars have theorized about adjusting [[macroeconomic]] [[economic indicator|indicator]]s to account for [[environmental change]]. The idea was developed early on through the work of Nordhaus and Tobin (1972), Ahmad et al. (1989), Repetto et al. (1989), and Hartwick (1990).&lt;ref&gt;John Asafu-Adjaye, [http://www.unescap.org/pdd/publications/dp25/dp25_ch4.pdf "Green National Accounting and the Measurement of Genuine (Extended) Saving"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811080135/http://www.unescap.org/pdd/publications/dp25/dp25_ch4.pdf |date=2007-08-11 }}, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, William Nordhaus and James Tobin introduced the first model to measure the annual real consumption of households, called the [[Measure of Economic Welfare]] (MEW).&lt;ref name="MEW"&gt;William Nordhaus and James Tobin, [https://www.nber.org/chapters/c7620.pdf "Is Growth Obsolete?"], National Bureau of Economic Research, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; MEW adjusts GDP to include the value of leisure time, unpaid work and [[environmental damage]]s.&lt;ref name="MEW" /&gt; They also defined a sustainable MEW (MEW-S) value, and their work was the precursor to more sophisticated measures of sustainable development.

Repetto further explored the impact that the failure of resource-based economies to account for the depreciation of their natural capital could have, especially by distorting evaluations of macroeconomic relationships and performance.&lt;ref name="Jeroen"&gt;Jeroen van den Bergh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p6bwKkM1GC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ecological Economics and Sustainable Development"], 1996&lt;/ref&gt; He and his colleagues developed the concept of depreciation accounting, which factors environmental depreciation into "aggregate measures of economic performance".&lt;ref name="Jeroen" /&gt;

In their seminal report, "Economic Accounting for Sustainable Development", Yusuf Ahmad, Salah El Serafy and Ernst Lutz compiled papers from several [[UNEP]]-[[World Bank]] sponsored workshops, convened after 1983, on how to develop [[environmental accounting]] as a [[public policy]] tool.&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;Edited by Yusuf J. Ahmad, Salah El Serafy and Ernst Lutz, [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/12/03/000178830_98101901491957/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf "Environmental Accounting for Sustainable Development"], The World Bank, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The central theme of all of the authors' arguments is that the [[system of national accounts]] (SNA), as it traditionally calculates income, omits important aspects of economic development that ought to be included.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; One important disagreement on environmentally adjusted indicators is presented by Anne Harrison and Salah El Serafy in their respective chapters.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; Harrison argues that appropriate adjustments ought to be made within the existing SNA framework, while El Serafy suggests a redefinition of what constitutes intermediate and final demand.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; In his view, the SNA should not consider the sale of natural capital as generating value added, while at least part of the income generated from this sale should be excluded from GDP and net product.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; This would effectively allow GDP to continue to be used extensively.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt;

In "Natural Resources, National Accounting and Economic Depreciation", John Hartwick presents an accounting methodology to find NNP inclusive of the depletion of natural resource stock by representing the use of natural resources as "economic depreciation magnitudes".&lt;ref&gt;John Hartwick, [http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/working_papers/papers/qed_wp_771.pdf "Natural Resources, National Accounting and Economic Depreciation"], Queen's University, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

This method of accounting, which makes adjustments to the existing national account indicators, found traction in the [[System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting]] (SEEA), published by the [[United Nations]] as an appendix to the 1993 SNA.&lt;ref name="Joy"&gt;Joy Hecht, [http://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C13/E1-21-03-04.pdf "The Evolving System of Integrated Economic and Environmental Accounts"], Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The report offered five approaches, or versions, to developing environmental accounts.&lt;ref name="Joy" /&gt; Over the years, the SEEA has been expanded and revised in view of the increased sophistication of accounting methodologies and technology. This revision will be explored in greater detail in the "Global Initiatives" section. Ultimately, the importance of the SEEA with respect to the green [[GDP]] is that it is possible to create full-sequence accounts from which aggregates such as green GDP can be derived and compared internationally, and many countries have begun this process.&lt;ref&gt;London Group on Environmental Accounting, [http://www.beyond-gdp.eu/download/bgdp-ve-seea.pdf "Why We Need the SEEA"], ''Beyond GDP'', 25 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reports and initiatives after the SEEA-1993 have explored the possibility of expanding or changing the scope of environmentally-adjusted macroeconomic indicators. As the popularity of green GDP and other environmentally adjusted macroeconomic indicators grows, their construction will increasingly draw on this continuously developing body of research, especially with respect to the methodology associated with valuing non-market capital (e.g., services from natural capital which exist outside of traditional market settings).

In 1993, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], the official bookkeeper of the U.S. economy, began responding to concerns that the GDP needed retooling. The agency began working on a green accounting system called Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounts. These initial results released in 1994 showed that GDP numbers were overstating the impact of mining companies to the nation's economic wealth. Mining companies didn't like those results, and in 1995 Alan B. Mollohan, a Democratic House Representative from West Virginia's coal country, sponsored an amendment to the 1995 Appropriations Bill that stopped the Bureau of Economic Analysis from working on revising the GDP and that's where things stand today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | title=Fixing GDP: Green Accounting in the United States | date=April 9, 2004 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602190235/http://gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | archivedate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph (2008), presentation in New York, 5 Feb 2008, "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q_PA_czIKM&amp;feature=related video from 3:18]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Costanza et al. (1997) estimated the current economic value of 17 [[ecosystem services]] for 16 biomes.&lt;ref name="Costanza"&gt;Costanza et al., [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v387/n6630/abs/387253a0.html "The Value of the World's Ecosystem Services and Natural Capital"], ''Nature'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the entire biosphere, most of which exists outside of the market, is estimated conservatively to be between $16–54 trillion per year.&lt;ref name="Costanza" /&gt; By comparison, global GNP is approximately $18 trillion per year.&lt;ref name="Costanza" /&gt; The size of this figure demonstrates the significance of ecosystem services on human welfare and income generation, and the importance of identifying and recognizing this value. The valuation techniques used by the authors were often based on estimations of individuals' "willingness-to-pay" for ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="Costanza" /&gt;

Kunte et al. (1998) use their paper "Estimating National Wealth: Methodology and Results" to demonstrate that expanding the national accounts to include natural capital is a "practical [and necessary] exercise".&lt;ref name="Kunte"&gt;Kunte et al., [http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/ceea/archive/Framework/Kunte_etal_1998.PDF "Estimating National Wealth"], The World Bank, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; They estimate the total wealth of nations by including different components of wealth in their calculations, including natural capital. They place values on natural capital by using the concept of economic rent. "Economic rent is the return on a commodity in excess of the minimum required to bring forth its services. Rental value is therefore the difference between the market price and cost of production / extraction."&lt;ref name="Kunte" /&gt; Following this, and by adjusting calculations for (un)sustainable use patterns, they are able to determine the stock of natural capital in a country that more accurately reflects its wealth.&lt;ref name="Kunte" /&gt;

Nature's Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment, written by William Nordhaus and Edward Kokkelenberg and published in 1999, examined whether or not to broaden the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) to include natural resources and the environment.&lt;ref name="Nordhaus"&gt;William Nordhaus and Edward Kokkelenberg, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3147043 "Nature's Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment"], National Academy Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The panel, which addressed this question, concluded that extending the NIPA and developing supplemental environmental accounts should be a high priority goals for the U.S., because these would provide useful data on a variety of economic issues and government trends, which entailed both replenishing and extractive activities.&lt;ref name="Nordhaus" /&gt; One of the major findings of the report is that it is fundamentally necessary for green adjustments to account for instances when natural capital is discovered or replenished, along with general depletive activities.

In 2004, [[Wen Jiabao]], the Chinese premier, announced that the green [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] index would replace the Chinese GDP index itself as a performance measure for government and party officials at the highest levels. The first green GDP accounting report, for 2004, was published in September 2006. It showed that the financial loss caused by pollution was 511.8 billion yuan ($66.3 billion), or 3.05 percent of the nation's economy.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Xiaohua (2007) "[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-04/19/content_853917.htm Call for return to green accounting]", ''China Daily'', 19 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an experiment in national accounting, the Green GDP effort collapsed in failure in 2007, when it became clear that the adjustment for environmental damage had reduced the growth rate to politically unacceptable levels, nearly zero in some provinces. In the face of mounting evidence that environmental damage and [[resource depletion]] was far more costly than anticipated, the government withdrew its support for the Green GDP methodology and suppressed the 2005 report, which had been due out in March, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, J. and Yardley, J. (2007) "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/world/asia/26china.html Choking on Growth: As China Roars, Pollution Reaches Deadly Extremes]", ''The New York Times'', 26 Aug 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent estimates of the cost to China of environmental degradation and resource depletion have for the last decade ranged from 8 to 12 percentage points of GDP growth.&lt;ref&gt;Economy, Elizabeth (2007) "[https://www.pbs.org/kqed/chinainside/nature/greengdp.html Green GDP: Accounting for the Environment in China]", ''China from the Inside'', U.S. Public Broadcasting System.&lt;/ref&gt; These estimates support the idea that, by this measure at least, the growth of the Chinese economy is close to zero.

The most promising national activity on the green GDP has been from India. The country's environmental minister, Jairam Ramesh, stated in 2009 that "It is possible for scientists to estimate green GDP. An exercise has started under the country's chief statistician Pronab Sen and by 2015, India's GDP numbers will be adjusted with economic costs of [[environmental degradation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/India-to-release--green-GDP--data-from-2015/544338/|title=India to release green GDP data from 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
The [[Global Reporting Initiative]]'s (GRI) core goals include the mainstreaming of disclosure on environmental, social and governance performance. Although the GRI is independent, it remains a collaborating centre of [[UNEP]] and works in cooperation with the [[United Nations Global Compact]]. It produces one of the world's most prevalent standards for sustainability reporting&amp;mdash;also known as [[ecological footprint]] reporting, [[Environmental Social and Corporate Governance|environmental social governance]] (ESG) reporting, [[triple bottom line]] (TBL) reporting, and [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) reporting. It is working on a green GDP to be implemented worldwide.

==Current debate==

Some critics of environmentally adjusted aggregates, including GDP, point out that it may be difficult to assign values to some of the outputs that are quantified. This is a particular difficulty in cases where the environmental asset does not exist in a traditional market and is therefore non-tradable. Ecosystem services are one example of this type of resource. In the case that valuation is undertaken indirectly, there is a possibility that calculations may rely on speculation or hypothetical assumptions.

Supporters of adjusted aggregates may reply to this objection in one of two ways. First, that as our technological capabilities increase, more accurate methods of valuation have been and will continue to develop. Second, that while measurements may not be perfect in the cases of non-market natural assets, the adjustments they entail are still a preferable alternative to traditional GDP.

A second objection may be found in the Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, when Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi remark that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"there is a more fundamental problem with green GDP, which also applies to Nordhaus and Tobin's SMEW and to the ISEW/GNI indices. None of these measures characterize sustainability per se. Green GDP just charges GDP for the depletion of or damage to environmental resources. This is only one part of the answer to the question of sustainability."&lt;ref name="Fitoussi" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="91645">The '''history of scientific method''' considers changes in the methodology of scientific inquiry, as distinct from the [[history of science]] itself. The development of rules for [[scientific reasoning]] has not been straightforward; scientific  method has been the subject of intense and recurring debate throughout the history of science, and eminent natural philosophers and scientists have argued for the primacy of one or another approach to establishing scientific knowledge. Despite the disagreements about approaches, scientific method has advanced in definite steps. Rationalist explanations of nature, including [[atomism]], appeared both in ancient Greece in the thought of [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]], and in ancient India, in the [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisesika]] and Buddhist schools, while [[Charvaka]] materialism rejected inference as a source of knowledge in favour of an empiricism that was always subject to doubt. Aristotle pioneered scientific method in ancient Greece alongside his empirical biology and his work on logic, rejecting a purely deductive framework in favour of generalisations made from observations of nature.

Some of the most important debates in the history of scientific method center on: [[rationalism]], especially as advocated by [[René Descartes]]&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[inductivism]], which rose to particular prominence with [[Isaac Newton]] and his followers; and [[hypothetico-deductivism]], which came to the fore in the early 19th century.  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a debate over [[Philosophical realism|realism]] vs. [[antirealism]] was central to discussions of scientific method as powerful scientific theories extended beyond the realm of the observable, while in the mid-20th century some prominent philosophers argued against any universal rules of [[science]] at all.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Achinstein, "General Introduction" (pp. 1–5) to ''Science Rules: A Historical Introduction to Scientific Methods''.  Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004.  {{ISBN|0-8018-7943-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early methodology==
[[File:Edwin Smith Papyrus v2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Edwin Smith papyrus]], an ancient Egyptian medical textbook of c. 1600 BCE, set out an  [[empirical method]].]]

There are few explicit discussions of scientific methodologies in surviving records from early cultures.  The most that can be inferred about the approaches to undertaking science in this period stems from descriptions of early investigations into nature, in the surviving records.  An [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Egyptian medical]] textbook, the [[Edwin Smith papyrus]], (c. 1600 BCE), applies the following components: examination, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis, to the treatment of disease,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9032043&amp;query=Edwin%20Smith%20papyrus&amp;ct=&lt;/ref&gt;  which display strong parallels to the basic [[empirical method]] of science and according to [[G. E. R. Lloyd]]&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, G. E. R.  "The development of empirical research", in his ''Magic, Reason and Experience: Studies in the Origin and Development of Greek Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; played a significant role in the development of this methodology. The [[Ebers papyrus]] (c. 1550 BCE) also contains evidence of traditional [[empiricism]].

By the middle of the 1st millennium BCE in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Babylonian astronomy]] had evolved into the earliest example of a scientific astronomy, as it was "the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena." According to the historian [[Asger Aaboe]], "all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy, in the [[Hellenistic astronomy|Hellenistic world]], [[Indian astronomy|in India]], [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|in the Islamic world]], and in [[Science in Medieval Western Europe|the West]] – if not indeed all subsequent endeavour in the [[exact science]]s – depend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways."&lt;ref name=Aaboe&gt;{{cite journal |title=Scientific Astronomy in Antiquity |author=A.

This was elaborated in great detail by [[Democritus]].

Similar atomist ideas emerged independently among ancient [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]] of the [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisesika]] and [[Buddhist atomism|Buddhist schools]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman, ''Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy.'' Routledge, 1999 , page 269.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, like the Nyaya, Vaisesika, and Buddhist schools, the [[Cārvāka]] epistemology was materialist, and skeptical enough to admit perception as the basis for unconditionally true knowledge, while cautioning that if one could only infer a truth, then one must also harbor a doubt about that truth; an inferred truth could not be unconditional.&lt;ref&gt;Kamal, M.M. (1998), "The Epistemology of the Carvaka Philosophy", ''Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies'', '''46'''(2): pp.13–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the middle of the 5th century BCE, some of the components of a scientific tradition were already heavily established, even before Plato, who was an important contributor to this emerging tradition, thanks to the development of deductive reasoning, as propounded by his student, [[Aristotle]].  In ''Protagoras'' (318d-f), [[Plato]] mentioned the teaching of arithmetic, astronomy and geometry in schools. The philosophical ideas of this time were mostly freed from the constraints of everyday phenomena and [[common sense]]. This denial of reality as we experience it reached an extreme in [[Parmenides]] who argued that the world is one and that change and subdivision do not exist.

In the 3rd and 4th centuries BCE, the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] physicians [[Herophilos]] (335–280 BCE) and [[Erasistratus of Chios]] employed experiments to further their medical research; Erasistratus at one time repeatedly weighing a caged bird, and noting its weight loss between feeding times.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Hellenistic Philosophy and Science'', pp. 383–384&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|[[Aristotle]]'s philosophy involved both inductive and deductive reasoning.]]
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Aristotle's inductive-deductive method used inductions from observations to infer general principles, deductions from those principles to check against further observations, and more cycles of induction and deduction to continue the advance of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Gauch2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gauch |first= Hugh G.|title= Scientific Method in Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC |accessdate= 10 February 2015 |year= 2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-01708-4 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Organon]]'' (Greek: Ὄργανον, meaning "instrument, tool, organ") is the standard collection of [[Aristotle]]'s six works on [[logic]]. The name ''Organon'' was given by Aristotle's followers, the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s.
The order of the works is not chronological (the chronology is now difficult to determine) but was deliberately chosen by [[Theophrastus]] to constitute a well-structured system.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Indeed, parts of them seem to be a scheme of a lecture on logic.  The arrangement of the works was made by [[Andronicus of Rhodes]] around 40 BCE.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;Hammond, p.&amp;nbsp;64,  "Andronicus Rhodus"&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Organon'' comprises the following six works:
# The ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|Κατηγορίαι}}, Latin: ''{{lang|la|Categoriae}}'') introduces Aristotle's 10-fold classification of that which exists: substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, situation, condition, action, and passion.
# ''[[De Interpretatione|On Interpretation]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας}}, Latin: ''{{lang|la|De Interpretatione}}'') introduces Aristotle's conception of [[proposition]] and [[judgment]], and the various relations between affirmative, negative, universal, and particular propositions. Aristotle discusses the [[square of opposition]] or square of [[Apuleius]] in Chapter 7 and its appendix Chapter 8. Chapter 9 deals with the [[problem of future contingents]].
# The ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|Ἀναλυτικὰ Πρότερα}}, Latin: ''{{lang|la|Analytica Priora}}'') introduces Aristotle's [[syllogism|syllogistic]] method (see [[term logic]]), argues for its correctness, and discusses inductive inference.
# The ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|Ἀναλυτικὰ Ὕστερα}}, Latin: ''{{lang|la|Analytica Posteriora}}'') deals with [[Demonstration (teaching)|demonstration]], [[definition]], and [[scientific knowledge]].
# The ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|Τοπικά}}, Latin: ''{{lang|la|Topica}}'') treats of issues in constructing valid arguments, and of inference that is probable, rather than certain.  It is in this treatise that Aristotle mentions the [[predicables]], later discussed by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and by the scholastic logicians.
# The [[On Sophistical Refutations|''Sophistical Refutations'']] (Greek: {{lang|grc|Περὶ Σοφιστικῶν Ἐλέγχων}}, Latin: ''{{lang|la|De Sophisticis Elenchis}}'') gives a treatment of logical fallacies, and provides a key link to Aristotle's work on rhetoric.

Aristotle's [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'']] has some points of overlap with the works making up the ''Organon'' but is not traditionally considered part of it; additionally there are works on logic attributed, with varying degrees of plausibility, to Aristotle that were not known to the Peripatetics.

[[Aristotle]] introduced what may be called a scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;"In the days when the Arabs inherited the culture of ancient Greece, Greek thought was chiefly interested in science, Athens was replaced by Alexandria, and Hellenism had an entirely "modem "outlook. This was an attitude with which Alexandria and its scholars were directly connected, but it was by no means confined to Alexandria. It was a logical outcome of the influence of Aristotle who before all else was a patient observer of nature, and was, in fact, the founder of modern science." Ch.1, Introduction —[[De Lacy O'Leary]] (1949), ''How Greek Science Passed to the Arabs'', London:  Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd., {{ISBN|0-7100-1903-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His demonstration method is found in ''[[Posterior Analytics]]''. He provided another of the ingredients of scientific tradition: [[empiricism]]. For Aristotle, universal truths can be known from particular things via induction. To some extent then, Aristotle reconciles abstract thought with observation, although it would be a mistake to imply that Aristotelian science is empirical in form.  Indeed, Aristotle did not accept that knowledge acquired by induction could rightly be counted as scientific knowledge. Nevertheless, induction was for him a necessary preliminary to the main business of scientific enquiry, providing the primary premises required for scientific demonstrations.

Aristotle largely ignored inductive reasoning in his treatment of scientific enquiry. To make it clear why this is so, consider this statement in the ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;We suppose ourselves to possess unqualified scientific knowledge of a thing, as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the sophist knows, when we think that we know the cause on which the fact depends, as the cause of that fact and of no other, and, further, that the fact could not be other than it is.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was therefore the work of the philosopher to demonstrate universal truths and to discover their causes.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Nominalism#The problem of universals]] for several approaches to this goal.&lt;/ref&gt; While induction was sufficient for discovering universals by generalization, it did not succeed in identifying causes. For this task Aristotle used the tool of [[deductive reasoning]] in the form of [[syllogism]]s. Using the syllogism, scientists could infer new universal truths from those already established.

Aristotle developed a complete normative approach to scientific inquiry involving the syllogism, which he discusses at length in his ''Posterior Analytics''. A difficulty with this scheme lay in showing that derived truths have solid primary premises.  Aristotle would not allow that demonstrations could be circular (supporting the conclusion by the premises, and the premises by the conclusion). Nor would he allow an infinite number of middle terms between the primary premises and the conclusion. This leads to the question of how the primary premises are found or developed, and as mentioned above, Aristotle allowed that induction would be required for this task.

Towards the end of the ''Posterior Analytics'', Aristotle discusses knowledge imparted by induction.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus it is clear that we must get to know the primary premises by induction; for the method by which even sense-perception implants the universal is inductive. [...] it follows that there will be no scientific knowledge of the primary premises, and since except intuition nothing can be truer than scientific knowledge, it will be intuition that apprehends the primary premises. [...] If, therefore, it is the only other kind of true thinking except scientific knowing, [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] will be the originative source of scientific knowledge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The account leaves room for doubt regarding the nature and extent of Aristotle's empiricism. In particular, it seems that Aristotle considers sense-perception only as a vehicle for knowledge through intuition. He restricted his investigations in natural history to their natural settings,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]] (fl. 4th c. BCE, d. 322 BCE), ''[[History of Animals]]'', including [[vivisection]] of the tortoise and chameleon. His theory of [[spontaneous generation]] was not experimentally disproved until [[Francesco Redi]] (1668).&lt;/ref&gt; such as at the Pyrrha lagoon,&lt;ref&gt;Armand Leroi, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QesWw3Zz0Ms Aristotle's Lagoon - Lesvos island - Greece] name of Pyrrha lagoon, now called Kalloni, minute 5:06/57:55. His spontaneous generation disproved, minute 50:00/57:55. His lack of experiment, minute 51:00/57:55&lt;/ref&gt; now called [[Kalloni]], at [[Lesbos]]. Aristotle and Theophrastus together formulated the new science of biology,&lt;ref&gt;Armand Leroi, following in Aristotle's footsteps, projects that Aristotle interviewed the fishermen of Lesbos to learn empirical details about the animals. (Leroi, ''Aristotle's Lagoon'')&lt;/ref&gt; inductively, case by case, for two years before Aristotle was called to tutor [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. Aristotle performed no modern-style experiments in the form in which they appear in today's physics and chemistry laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;
See: [[Ancient Greek medicine#Aristotle]], which cites Annas, Julia ''Classical Greek Philosophy''. In Boardman, John; Griffin, Jasper; Murray, Oswyn (ed.) ''The Oxford History of the Classical World''. Oxford University Press: New York, 1986. {{ISBN|0-19-872112-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Induction is not afforded the status of scientific reasoning, and so it is left to intuition to provide a solid foundation for Aristotle's science. With that said, Aristotle brings us somewhat closer an empirical science than his predecessors.

===Epicurus===
In his  work Kαvώv ('canon', a straight edge or ruler, thus any type of measure or standard, referred to as 'canonic'), [[Epicurus]] laid out his first rule for inquiry in physics: 'that the ''first concepts be seen'',&lt;ref name="Asmis1984"&gt;{{harvnb|Asmis|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.20}} and that they ''not require demonstration'' '.&lt;ref name="Asmis1984"/&gt;{{rp|pp.35–47}}

His second rule for inquiry was that prior to an investigation, ''we are to have self-evident concepts'',&lt;ref name="Asmis1984"/&gt;{{rp|pp.61–80}} so that we might infer [ἔχωμεν οἷς σημειωσόμεθα] both what is expected [τò προσμένον], and also what is non-apparent [τò ἄδηλον].&lt;ref name="Asmis1984"/&gt;{{rp|pp.83–103}}

Epicurus applies his method of inference (the use of observations as signs, Asmis' summary, p.&amp;nbsp;333: ''the method of using the phenomena as signs (σημεῖα) of what is unobserved'')&lt;ref name="Asmis1984"/&gt;{{rp|pp.175–196}} immediately to the [[atomic theory]] of [[Democritus]].  In Aristotle's ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Aristotle himself employs the use of signs.&lt;ref name="Asmis1984"/&gt;{{rp| pp.212–224}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/185720?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Madden, Edward H.

==Emergence of inductive experimental method==
During the [[Middle Ages]] issues of what is now termed science began to be addressed. There was greater emphasis on combining theory with practice in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] than there had been in Classical times, and it was common for those studying the sciences to be artisans as well, something that had been "considered an aberration in the ancient world." Islamic experts in the sciences were often expert instrument makers who enhanced their powers of observation and calculation with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Science in the Middle Ages|author=[[David C. Lindberg]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1980|isbn=0-226-48233-2|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science in medieval Islam|Muslim scientists]] used [[experiment]] and [[Quantification (science)|quantification]] to distinguish between competing scientific theories, set within a generically [[empirical]] orientation, as can be seen in the works of [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (721–815)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Clarendon Press | last = Holmyard | first = E. J. | title = Makers of Chemistry | location = Oxford | year = 1931 | url = https://archive.org/details/makersofchemistr029725mbp | page = 56 | authorlink = Eric John Holmyard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]] (801–873)&lt;ref name=Plinio-17&gt;Plinio Prioreschi, "Al-Kindi, A Precursor Of The Scientific Revolution", ''Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine'', 2002 (2): 17–19 [17].&lt;/ref&gt; as early examples. Several scientific methods thus emerged from the medieval [[Muslim world]] by the early 11th century, all of which emphasized experimentation as well as quantification to varying degrees.

===Ibn al-Haytham===
[[File:Thesaurus_opticus_Titelblatt.jpg|thumb|left|"How does light travel through transparent bodies? Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only.... We have explained this exhaustively in our ''[[Book of Optics]]''."&lt;ref name=Sambursky /&gt; —[[Alhazen]] ]]
The [[Islamic physics|Arab physicist]] [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) used experimentation to obtain the results in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021). He combined [[observation]]s, [[experiment]]s and [[Rationality|rational]] arguments to support his intromission theory of [[visual perception|vision]], in which [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]] are emitted from objects rather than from the eyes. He used similar arguments to show that the ancient [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory of vision]] supported by [[Ptolemy]] and [[Euclid]] (in which the eyes emit the rays of light used for seeing), and the ancient [[intromission theory]] supported by [[Aristotle]] (where objects emit physical particles to the eyes), were both wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. C. Lindberg]], ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago, Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 60–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental evidence supported most of the propositions in his ''Book of Optics'' and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and dioptrics.  His legacy was elaborated through the 'reforming' of his ''Optics'' by [[Kamal al-Din al-Farisi]] (d. c. 1320) in the latter's ''Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir'' (''The Revision of'' [Ibn al-Haytham's] ''Optics'').&lt;ref&gt;Nader El-Bizri, "A Philosophical Perspective on Alhazen’s Optics," ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'', Vol. 15, Issue 2 (2005), pp. 189–218 (Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nader El-Bizri, "Ibn al-Haytham," in ''Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia'', eds. Thomas F. Glick, Steven J. Livesey, and Faith Wallis (New York – London: Routledge, 2005), pp. 237–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen viewed his scientific studies as a search for [[truth]]: "Truth is sought for its own sake. And those who are engaged upon the quest for anything for its own sake are not interested in other things. Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough. ...&lt;ref&gt;Alhazen (Ibn Al-Haytham) ''Critique of Ptolemy'', translated by S. Pines, ''Actes X Congrès internationale d'histoire des sciences'', Vol '''I''' Ithaca 1962, as referenced on p.139 of Shmuel Sambursky (ed. 1974) ''Physical Thought from the Presocratics to the Quantum Physicists'' {{ISBN|0-87663-712-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen's work included the conjecture that "Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only", which he was able to corroborate only after years of effort. He stated, "[This] is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes. ... the entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air."&lt;ref name=Sambursky&gt;Alhazen, translated into English from German by M. Schwarz, from "Abhandlung über das Licht" (Treatise on Light — رسالة في الضوء), J. Baarmann (ed. 1882) ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'' Vol '''36''' as referenced on p.136 by Shmuel Sambursky (1974) ''Physical thought from the Presocratics to the Quantum Physicists'' {{ISBN|0-87663-712-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also demonstrated the conjecture by placing a straight stick or a taut thread next to the light beam.&lt;ref&gt;p.136, as quoted by Shmuel Sambursky (1974) ''Physical thought from the Presocratics to the Quantum Physicists'' {{ISBN|0-87663-712-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn al-Haytham also employed [[scientific skepticism]] and emphasized the role of [[empiricism]]. He also explained the role of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] in [[syllogism]], and criticized [[Aristotle]] for his lack of contribution to the method of induction, which Ibn al-Haytham regarded as superior to syllogism, and he considered induction to be the basic requirement for true scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Plott |first=C. |year=2000 |title=Global History of Philosophy: The Period of Scholasticism |isbn=81-208-0551-8 |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |page=462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Something like [[Occam's razor]] is also present in the ''Book of Optics''. For example, after demonstrating that light is generated by luminous objects and emitted or reflected into the eyes, he states that therefore "the [[Emission theory (vision)|extramission]] of [visual] rays is superfluous and useless."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Alhacen's Theory of Visual Perception: A Critical Edition, with English Translation and Commentary of the First Three Books of Alhacen's De Aspectibus, the Medieval Latin Version of Ibn al-Haytham's Kitab al-Manazir|last1=[[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]]|first2=A. Mark|last2=Smith|year=2001|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=0-87169-914-1|pages=372 &amp; 408}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may also have been the first scientist to adopt a form of [[positivism]] in his approach. He wrote that "we do not go beyond experience, and we cannot be content to use pure concepts in investigating natural phenomena", and that the understanding of these cannot be acquired without mathematics. After assuming that light is a material substance, he does not further discuss its nature but confines his investigations to the diffusion and propagation of light. The only properties of light he takes into account are those treatable by geometry and verifiable by experiment.&lt;ref name=Rashed&gt;{{Citation |last=Rashed |first=Roshdi |year=2007 |title=The Celestial Kinematics of Ibn al-Haytham |journal=Arabic Sciences and Philosophy |volume=17 |pages=7–55 [19] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |doi=10.1017/S0957423907000355 }}: {{quote|"In reforming optics he, as it were, adopted ‘‘positivism’’ (before the term was invented): we do not go beyond experience, and we cannot be content to use pure concepts in investigating natural phenomena.

In his optics ‘‘the smallest parts of light’’, as he calls them, retain only properties that can be treated by geometry and verified by experiment; they lack all sensible qualities except energy."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Biruni===
The [[Persian people|Persian]] scientist [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]] introduced early scientific methods for several different fields of [[inquiry]] during the 1020s and 1030s. For example, in his treatise on [[mineralogy]], ''Kitab al-Jawahir'' (''Book of Precious Stones''), al-Biruni is "the most [[Exact science|exact]] of [[experiment]]al scientists", while in the introduction to his [[Indology|study of India]], he declares that "to execute our project, it has not been possible to follow the geometric method" and thus became one of the pioneers of  [[comparative sociology]] in insisting on field experience and information.&lt;ref name=Sardar&gt;{{citation|first=Ziauddin|last=Sardar|author-link=Ziauddin Sardar|year=1998|contribution=Science in Islamic philosophy|title=Islamic Philosophy|publisher=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H016.htm|accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed an early experimental method for [[mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Rozhanskaya-642&gt;Mariam Rozhanskaya and I. S. Levinova (1996), "Statics", p. 642, in {{Harv|Morelon|Rashed|1996|pp=614–642}}: {{quote|"Using a whole body of mathematical methods (not only those inherited from the antique theory of ratios and infinitesimal techniques, but also the methods of the contemporary algebra and fine calculation techniques), Arabic scientists raised statics to a new, higher level. The classical results of Archimedes in the theory of the centre of gravity were generalized and applied to three-dimensional bodies, the theory of ponderable lever was founded and the 'science of gravity' was created and later further developed in medieval Europe. The phenomena of statics were studied by using the dynamic approach so that two trends – statics and dynamics – turned out to be inter-related within a single science, mechanics. The combination of the dynamic approach with Archimedean hydrostatics gave birth to a direction in science which may be called medieval hydrodynamics. [...] Numerous fine experimental methods were developed for determining the specific weight, which were based, in particular, on the theory of balances and weighing. The classical works of al-Biruni and al-Khazini can by right be considered as the beginning of the application of experimental methods in [[medieval science]]."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Biruni's methods resembled the modern scientific method,  particularly in his emphasis on repeated experimentation. Biruni was concerned with how to conceptualize and prevent both [[systematic error]]s and observational biases, such as "errors caused by the use of small instruments and errors made by human observers." He argued that if instruments produce errors because of their imperfections or idiosyncratic qualities, then multiple observations must be taken, [[Qualitative research|analyzed qualitatively]], and on this basis, arrive at a "common-sense single value for the constant sought", whether an [[arithmetic mean]] or a "reliable [[Approximation|estimate]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Glick |first1=Thomas F. |last2=Livesey |first2=Steven John |last3=Wallis |first3=Faith |year=2005 |title=Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-96930-1 |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his scientific method, "universals came out of practical, [[experiment]]al work" and "theories are formulated after discoveries", as with [[inductivism]].&lt;ref name=Sardar/&gt;

===Ibn Sina (Avicenna)===
In the ''On Demonstration'' section of ''[[The Book of Healing]]'' (1027), the [[Avicennism|Persian philosopher]] and scientist [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) discussed [[philosophy of science]] and described an early scientific method of inquiry. He discussed [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' and significantly diverged from it on several points. Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper procedure for scientific inquiry and the question of "How does one acquire the first principles of a science?" He asked how a scientist might find "the initial [[axiom]]s or [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] of a [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] science without inferring them from some more basic premises?" He explained that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a "relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty." Avicenna added two further methods for finding a [[first principle]]: the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] method of induction (''istiqra''), and the more recent method of [[Hypothesis|examination]] and [[experiment]]ation (''tajriba''). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that "it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide." In its place, he advocated "a method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McGinnis|first=Jon|title=Scientific Methodologies in Medieval Islam|journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy|volume=41|issue=3|date=July 2003|pages=307–327|doi=10.1353/hph.2003.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (1025), Avicenna was also the first to describe what is essentially [[Mill's Methods|methods of agreement, difference and concomitant variation]] which are critical to [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]] and the scientific method.&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 155, [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodman-1992&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (1992), ''Avicenna'', p. 33, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-01929-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;James Franklin (2001), ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'', pp. 177–8, Johns Hopkins University Press, {{ISBN|0-8018-6569-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike his contemporary al-Biruni's scientific method, in which "universals came out of practical, experimental work" and "theories are formulated after discoveries", Avicenna developed a scientific procedure in which "general and universal questions came first and led to experimental work."&lt;ref name="Sardar"/&gt; Due to the differences between their methods, al-Biruni referred to himself as a mathematical [[scientist]] and to Avicenna as a [[philosopher]], during a debate between the two scholars.&lt;ref name=Dallal&gt;{{citation|first=Ahmad|last=Dallal|year=2001–2002|title=The Interplay of Science and Theology in the Fourteenth-century Kalam|publisher=From Medieval to Modern in the Islamic World, Sawyer Seminar at the [[University of Chicago]] |url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/institute/sawyer/archive/islam/dallal.html |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert Grosseteste===
During the European [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], ideas on scientific methodology, including Aristotle's [[empiricism]] and the [[experiment]]al approaches of Alhazen and Avicenna, were introduced to medieval Europe via [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Latin translations]] of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] texts and commentaries. [[Robert Grosseteste]]'s commentary on the ''Posterior Analytics'' places Grosseteste among the first [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] thinkers in Europe to understand [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] vision of the dual nature of scientific reasoning. Concluding from particular observations into a universal law, and then back again, from universal laws to prediction of particulars. Grosseteste called this "resolution and composition". Further, Grosseteste said that both paths should be verified through experimentation to verify the principles.&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Crombie, ''Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science, 1100–1700'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971), pp. 52–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roger Bacon===
[[Roger Bacon]] was inspired by the writings of Grosseteste. In his account of a method, Bacon described a repeating cycle of ''[[observation]]'', ''[[hypothesis]]'', ''[[experiment]]ation'', and the need for independent ''verification''.{{cn|date=June 2018}} He recorded the way he had conducted his experiments in precise detail, perhaps with the idea that others could reproduce and independently test his results.

About 1256 he joined the [[Franciscan Order]] and became subject to the Franciscan statute forbidding [[Friar]]s from publishing books or pamphlets without specific approval.  After the accession of Pope [[Clement IV]] in 1265, the Pope granted Bacon a special commission to write to him on scientific matters.  In eighteen months he completed three large treatises, the ''Opus Majus'', ''Opus Minus'', and ''Opus Tertium'' which he sent to the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Hackett, "Roger Bacon: His Life, Career, and Works," in Hackett, ''Roger Bacon and the Sciences,'' pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Whewell]] has called ''Opus Majus'' at once the Encyclopaedia and Organon of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Roger Bacon", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Eleventh Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
*Part I (pp.&amp;nbsp;1–22) treats of the four causes of error: authority, custom, the opinion of the unskilled many, and the concealment of real ignorance by a pretense of knowledge.
*Part VI (pp.&amp;nbsp;445–477) treats of experimental science, ''domina omnium scientiarum''. There are two methods of knowledge: the one by argument, the other by experience. Mere argument is never sufficient; it may decide a question, but gives no satisfaction or certainty to the mind, which can only be convinced by immediate inspection or intuition, which is what experience gives.
*Experimental science, which in the ''Opus Tertium'' (p.&amp;nbsp;46) is distinguished from the speculative sciences and the operative arts, is said to have three great prerogatives over all sciences:
*#It verifies their conclusions by direct experiment;
*#It discovers truths which they could never reach;
*#It investigates the secrets of nature, and opens to us a knowledge of past and future.
*Roger Bacon illustrated his method by an investigation into the nature and cause of the [[rainbow]], as a specimen of inductive research.&lt;ref name=EBbacon&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bacon, Roger |volume=3 |page=155 |first=Robert |last=Adamson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance humanism and medicine===
Aristotle’s ideas became a framework for critical debate beginning with absorption of the Aristotelian texts into the university curriculum in the first half of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Instead of reading Aristotle directly from Greek texts, students of these texts would rely on summaries and translations of Aristotle's work, coupled with commentary by the translators, according to Elaine Limbrick, who cites Michel Reulos,  "L'Enseignement d'Aristote dans les collèges au XVIe siècle" in ''Platon et Aristote à la Renaissance'' ed. J.-C. Margolin (Paris: Vrin, 1976) pp147-154:{{harvnb| Sanches| Limbrick| Thomson| 1988|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contributing to this was the success of medieval theologians in reconciling Aristotelian philosophy with Christian theology. Within the sciences, medieval philosophers were not afraid of disagreeing with Aristotle on many specific issues, although their disagreements were stated within the language of Aristotelian philosophy. All medieval natural philosophers were Aristotelians, but "Aristotelianism" had become a somewhat broad and flexible concept.  With the end of Middle Ages, the [[Renaissance]] rejection of medieval traditions coupled with an extreme reverence for classical sources led to a recovery of other ancient philosophical traditions, especially the teachings of Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional, and Intellectual Contexts'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1996,  pp. 164–7.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 17th century, those who clung dogmatically to Aristotle's teachings were faced with several competing approaches to nature.&lt;ref&gt;"Even Aristotle would have laughed at the stupidity of his commentators." — {{harvnb|Vives|1531}} attacks obscurity in Aristotle's works, as cited by {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|pp=28–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leonhart Fuchs Historia Stirpium.jpg|thumb|[[Leonhart Fuchs]]' drawing of [[absinthe]] plant, ''De Historia Stirpium''. Basle 1542]]
The discovery of the Americas at the close of the 15th century showed the scholars of Europe that new discoveries could be found outside of the authoritative works of Aristotle, Pliny, Galen, and other ancient writers.

[[Galen of Pergamon]] (129 – c. 200 AD) had studied with four schools in antiquity — [[Platonist]]s, [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]s, [[Stoicism|Stoic]]s, and [[Epicurean]]s, and at Alexandria, the center of medicine at the time. In his ''Methodus Medendi'', Galen had synthesized the empirical and dogmatic schools of medicine into his own method, which was preserved by Arab scholars. After the translations from Arabic were critically scrutinized, a backlash occurred and demand arose in Europe for translations of Galen's medical text from the original Greek. Galen's method became very popular in Europe. [[Thomas Linacre]], the teacher of Erasmus, thereupon translated ''Methodus Medendi'' from Greek into Latin for a larger audience in 1519.&lt;ref&gt;Galenus, Claudius (1519) ''Galenus methodus medendi, vel de morbis curandis, T. Linacro ... interprete, libri quatuordecim'' Lutetiae. as cited by {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limbrick 1988 notes that 630 editions, translations, and commentaries on Galen were produced in Europe in the 16th century, eventually eclipsing Arabic medicine there, and peaking in 1560, at the time of the [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Durling (1961) "A Chronological Census of Renaissance Editions and Translations of Galen", in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtald Institutes'' '''24''' pp.242-3 as cited on p. 300 of {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 15th century, the physician-scholar [[Niccolò Leoniceno]] was finding errors in [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''. As a physician, Leoniceno was concerned about these botanical errors propagating to the [[materia medica]] on which medicines were based.&lt;ref&gt;[[Niccolò Leoniceno]] (1509), ''De Plinii et aliorum erroribus liber'' apud Ferrara, as cited by {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter this, a botanical garden was established at [[Orto botanico di Padova]], University of Padua (in use for teaching by 1546), in order that medical students might have empirical access to the plants of a pharmacopia. Other Renaissance teaching gardens were established, notably by the physician [[Leonhart Fuchs]], one of the founders of [[botany]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs's book on the methods of Galen and Hippocrates became a standard medical text of 809 pages: Leonhart Fuchs (1560) ''Institutionum medicinae, sive methodi ad Hippocratis, Galeni, aliorumque veterum scripta recte intelligenda mire utiles libri quinque ...'' Editio secunda. Lugduni. As cited in {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson| 1988| pp= 61 and 301}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published work devoted to the concept of method is Jodocus Willichius, ''De methodo omnium artium et disciplinarum informanda opusculum'' (1550).{{citation needed|reason=First? Aristotle, Grosseteste...|date=February 2014}}

===Skepticism as a basis for understanding===
In 1562 "Outlines of Pyrrhonism" by [[Sextus Empiricus]] (c. 160-210 AD) appeared in print and in Latin, quickly placing the arguments of classical skepticism in the European mainstream. Skepticism either denies or strongly doubts (depending on the school) the possibility of certain knowledge. [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' famous "[[Cogito ergo sum|Cogito]]" argument is an attempt to overcome skepticism and reestablish a foundation for certainty but other thinkers responded by revising what the search for knowledge, particularly physical knowledge, might be.

The first of these, philosopher and physician [[Francisco Sanches]], was led by his medical training at Rome, 1571–73, to search for a true method of knowing (''modus sciendi''), as nothing clear can be known by the methods of Aristotle and his followers&lt;ref&gt;'I have sometimes seen a verbose quibbler attempting to persuade some ignorant person that white was black; to which the latter replied, "I do not understand your reasoning, since I have not studied as much as you have; yet I honestly believe that white differs from black. But pray go on refuting me for just as long as you like." '— {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; — for example, 1) syllogism fails upon circular reasoning; 2) Aristotle's [[modal logic]] was not stated clearly enough for use in medieval times, and remains a research problem to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/#ModLog Susanne Bobzien, "Aristotle's modal logic" ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' ]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the physician Galen's ''method of medicine'', Sanches lists the methods of judgement and experience, which are faulty in the wrong hands,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|p=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and we are left with the bleak statement ''That Nothing is Known'' (1581, in Latin ''Quod Nihil Scitur''). This challenge was taken up by René Descartes in the next generation (1637), but at the least, Sanches warns us that we ought to refrain from the methods, summaries, and commentaries on Aristotle, if we seek scientific knowledge. In this, he is echoed by Francis Bacon who was influenced by another prominent exponent of skepticism, [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]]; Sanches cites the humanist [[Juan Luis Vives]] who sought a better educational system, as well as a statement of human rights as a pathway for improvement of the lot of the poor.

"Sanches develops his scepticism by means of an intellectual critique of Aristotelianism, rather than by an appeal to the history of human stupidity and the variety and contrariety of previous theories." —{{harvnb|Popkin|1979|p=37}}, as cited by {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|pp=24–5}}

In the meantime, as I prepare to examine ''Things'', I shall raise the question anything is ''known'', and if so, how, in the introductory passages of another book,&lt;ref&gt;"Since, as he had shown, nothing can be known, Sanches put forward a procedure, not to gain knowledge but to deal constructively with human experience. This procedure, for which he introduced the term (for the first time) scientific method, “Metodo universal de las ciencias,” consists in patient, careful empirical research and cautious judgment and evaluation of the data we observe. This would not lead, as his contemporary Francis Bacon thought, to a key to knowledge of the world. But it would allow us to obtain the best information available. ...In advancing this limited or constructive view of science, Sanches was the first Renaissance sceptic to conceive of science in its modern form, as the fruitful activity about the study of nature that remained after one had given up the search for absolutely certain knowledge of the nature of things. {{harvnb|Popkin|2003|p=41}}"&lt;/ref&gt; a book in which I will expound, as far as human frailty allows,&lt;ref name="modoSciendi"&gt;{{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|p=292}} lists ''De modo sciendi'' under the Unpublished, Lost, or Projected Works [of Francisco Sanches].

===Francis Bacon's eliminative induction===
{{main|Baconian method}}

{{quote|"If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties."&amp;nbsp;—[[Francis Bacon]] (1605) ''[[The Advancement of Learning]]'', Book 1, v, 8}}

[[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626) entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in April 1573, where he applied himself diligently to the several sciences as then taught, and came to the conclusion that the methods employed and the results attained were alike erroneous; he learned to despise the current Aristotelian philosophy. He believed philosophy must be taught its true purpose, and for this purpose a new method must be devised. With this conception in his mind, Bacon left the university.&lt;ref name=EBbacon /&gt;

Bacon attempted to describe a rational procedure for establishing causation between phenomena based on induction. Bacon's induction was, however, radically different than that employed by the Aristotelians. As Bacon put it,

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]nother form of induction must be devised than has hitherto been employed, and it must be used for proving and discovering not first principles (as they are called) only, but also the lesser axioms, and the middle, and indeed all. For the induction which proceeds by simple enumeration is childish.  —''[[Novum Organum]]'' section CV&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Baconian method|Bacon's method]] relied on experimental ''histories'' to eliminate alternative theories.&lt;ref&gt;In this sense, it has been seen as a precursor to [[Falsifiability#Falsificationism|falsificationism]] of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[Karl Popper]]. However, Bacon believed his method would produce certain knowledge, similar to Peirce's view of scientific methods as ultimately approaching the truth; with the goal of attaining knowledge of the truth, Bacon's philosophy is less sceptical than Popper's philosophy.
*Bacon precedes Peirce in another sense – his reliance on doubt: "If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts he shall end in certainties." – [[Francis Bacon]], ''The Advancement of Learning'' (1605), Book I, v, 8.
&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon explains how his method is applied in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (published 1620). In an example he gives on the examination of the nature of heat, Bacon creates two tables, the first of which he names "Table of Essence and Presence", enumerating the many various circumstances under which we find heat. In the other table, labelled "Table of Deviation, or of Absence in Proximity", he lists circumstances which bear resemblance to those of the first table except for the absence of heat. From an analysis of what he calls the ''natures'' (light emitting, heavy, colored, etc.) of the items in these lists we are brought to conclusions about the ''form nature'', or cause, of heat. Those natures which are always present in the first table, but never in the second are deemed to be the cause of heat.

The role experimentation played in this process was twofold. The most laborious job of the scientist would be to gather the facts, or 'histories', required to create the tables of presence and absence. Such histories would document a mixture of common knowledge and experimental results. Secondly, ''experiments of light'', or, as we might say, [[crucial experiment]]s would be needed to resolve any remaining ambiguities over causes.

Bacon showed an uncompromising commitment to [[experiment]]ation. Despite this, he did not make any great scientific discoveries during his lifetime. This may be because he was not the most able experimenter.&lt;ref&gt;B. Gower, ''Scientific Method, An Historical and Philosophical Introduction'', (Routledge, 1997), pp. 48–2.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be because [[hypothesis]]ing plays only a small role in Bacon's method compared to modern science.&lt;ref&gt;B. Russell, ''History of Western Philosophy'', (Routledge, 2000), pp. 529–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Hypotheses, in Bacon's method, are supposed to emerge during the process of investigation, with the help of mathematics and logic. &lt;!-- with little room left for guess work and creativity. --&gt; Bacon gave a substantial but secondary role to mathematics &lt;!-- Neither did he attribute much importance to mathematical speculation --&gt; ''"which ought only to give definiteness to natural philosophy, not to generate or give it birth"'' (''Novum Organum XCVI''). An over-emphasis on axiomatic reasoning had rendered previous non-empirical philosophy impotent, in Bacon's view, which was expressed in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
XIX. There are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from these principles, the truth of which it takes for settled and immoveable, proceeds to judgment and to the discovery of middle axioms. And this way is now in fashion. The other derives axioms from the senses and particulars, rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent, so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all. This is the true way, but as yet untried.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Bacon's [[utopia|utopian novel]], ''The [[New Atlantis]]'', the ultimate role is given for inductive reasoning:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lastly, we have three that raise the former discoveries by experiments into greater observations, axioms, and aphorisms. These we call interpreters of nature.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Descartes===
{{main|Cartesianism}}

In 1619, [[René Descartes]] began writing his first major treatise on proper scientific and philosophical thinking, the unfinished ''[[Rules for the Direction of the Mind]]''.  His aim was to create a complete science that he hoped would overthrow the Aristotelian system and establish himself as the sole architect&lt;ref&gt;Descartes compares his work to that of an architect: "there is less perfection in works composed of several separate pieces and by difference masters, than those in which only one person has worked.", ''Discourse on Method and The Meditations'', (Penguin, 1968), pp. 35.  (see too his letter to Mersenne (28. January 1641 [AT III, 297–8]).&lt;/ref&gt; of a new system of guiding principles for scientific research.

This work was continued and clarified in his 1637 treatise, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', and in his 1641 ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]]''. Descartes describes the intriguing and disciplined thought experiments he used to arrive at the idea we instantly associate with him: ''[[cogito ergo sum|I think therefore I am]]''.

From this foundational thought, Descartes finds proof of the existence of a God who, possessing all possible perfections, will not deceive him provided he resolves "[...] never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of methodic doubt."&lt;ref&gt;This is the first of four rules Descartes resolved "never once to fail to observe", ''Discourse on Method and The Meditations'', (Penguin, 1968), pp. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule allowed Descartes to progress beyond his own thoughts and judge that there exist extended bodies outside of his own thoughts. Descartes published seven sets of objections to the ''Meditations'' from various sources&lt;ref&gt;René Descartes, ''Meditations on First Philosophy: With Selections from the Objections and Replies'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 2nd ed., 1996), pp. 63–107.&lt;/ref&gt; along with his replies to them. Despite his apparent departure from the Aristotelian system, a number of his critics felt that Descartes had done little more than replace the primary premises of Aristotle with those of his own. Descartes says as much himself in a letter written in 1647 to the translator of [[Principles of Philosophy]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;a perfect knowledge [...] must necessarily be deduced from first causes [...] we must try to deduce from these principles knowledge of the things which depend on them, that there be nothing in the whole chain of deductions deriving from them that is not perfectly manifest.&lt;ref&gt;René Descartes, ''The Philosophical Writings of Descartes: Principles of Philosophy, Preface to French Edition, translated by J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff, D. Murdoch'' (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1985), vol. 1, pp. 179–189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And again, some years earlier, speaking of Galileo's physics in a letter to his friend and critic [[Marin Mersenne|Mersenne]] from 1638,

&lt;blockquote&gt;without having considered the first causes of nature, [Galileo] has merely looked for the explanations of a few particular effects, and he has thereby built without foundations.&lt;ref&gt;René Descartes, ''Oeuvres De Descartes'', edited by Charles Adam and [[Paul Tannery]] (Paris: Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, 1983), vol. 2, pp. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whereas Aristotle purported to arrive at his first principles by induction, Descartes believed he could obtain them using reason only. In this sense, he was a Platonist, as he believed in the innate ideas, as opposed to Aristotle's [[tabula rasa|blank slate]] (''tabula rasa''), and stated that the seeds of science are inside us.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandre Koyré|Koyré, Alexandre]]: Introduction a la Lecture de Platon, suivi de Entretiens sur Descartes, Gallimard, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Bacon, Descartes successfully applied his own ideas in practice. He made significant contributions to science, in particular in aberration-corrected optics. His work in [[analytic geometry]] was a necessary precedent to [[differential calculus]] and instrumental in bringing mathematical analysis to bear on scientific matters.

===Galileo Galilei===
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|[[Galileo Galilei]], 1564–1642, a father of scientific method]]

During the period of religious conservatism brought about by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], [[Galileo Galilei]] unveiled his new science of motion. Neither the contents of Galileo’s science, nor the methods of study he selected were in keeping with Aristotelian teachings.  Whereas Aristotle thought that a science should be demonstrated from first principles, Galileo had used experiments as a research tool. Galileo nevertheless presented his treatise in the form of mathematical demonstrations without reference to experimental results. It is important to understand that this in itself was a bold and innovative step in terms of scientific method. The usefulness of mathematics in obtaining scientific results was far from obvious.&lt;ref&gt;For more about the role of mathematics in science around the time of Galileo see R. Feldhay, ''The Cambridge Companion to Galileo: The use and abuse of mathematical entities'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1998), pp. 80–133.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because mathematics did not lend itself to the primary pursuit of Aristotelian science: the discovery of causes.

Whether it is because Galileo was realistic about the acceptability of presenting experimental results as evidence or because he himself had doubts about the [[epistemology|epistemological]] status of experimental findings is not known. Nevertheless, it is not in his [[Latin]] treatise on motion that we find reference to experiments, but in his supplementary dialogues written in the Italian vernacular. In these dialogues experimental results are given, although Galileo may have found them inadequate for persuading his audience. [[Thought experiment]]s showing logical contradictions in Aristotelian thinking, presented in the skilled rhetoric of Galileo's dialogue were further enticements for the reader.

[[File:GalileosInclinedPlane.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Modern replica of Galileo's inclined plane experiment: The distance covered by a uniformly accelerated body is proportional to the square of the time elapsed.]] As an example, in the dramatic dialogue titled ''Third Day'' from his ''[[Two New Sciences]]'', Galileo has the characters of the dialogue discuss an experiment involving two free falling objects of differing weight. An outline of the Aristotelian view is offered by the character Simplicio. For this experiment he expects that "a body which is ten times as heavy as another will move ten times as rapidly as the other". The character Salviati, representing Galileo's persona in the dialogue, replies by voicing his doubt that Aristotle ever attempted the experiment. Salviati then asks the two other characters of the dialogue to consider a thought experiment whereby two stones of differing weights are tied together before being released. Following Aristotle, Salviati reasons that "the more rapid one will be partly retarded by the slower, and the slower will be somewhat hastened by the swifter". But this leads to a contradiction, since the two stones together make a heavier object than either stone apart, the heavier object should in fact fall with a speed greater than that of either stone. From this contradiction, Salviati concludes that Aristotle must, in fact, be wrong and the objects will fall at the same speed regardless of their weight, a conclusion that is borne out by experiment.

In his 1991 survey of developments in the modern accumulation of knowledge such as this Charles Van Doren&lt;ref&gt;Van Doren, Charles. A History of Knowledge. (New York, Ballantine, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; considers that the Copernican Revolution really is the Galilean Cartesian (René Descartes) or simply the Galilean revolution on account of the courage and depth of change brought about by the work of Galileo.

===Isaac Newton===
[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sir Isaac Newton]], the discoverer of [[universal gravitation]] and one of the most influential scientists in history]]
{{main| Newton's Rules for Science}}

Both Bacon and Descartes wanted to provide a firm foundation for scientific thought that avoided the deceptions of the mind and senses. Bacon envisaged that foundation as essentially empirical, whereas Descartes provides a metaphysical foundation for knowledge.  If there were any doubts about the direction in which scientific method would develop, they were set to rest by the success of [[Isaac Newton]]. Implicitly rejecting Descartes' emphasis on [[rationalism]] in favor of Bacon's empirical approach, he outlines his four "rules of reasoning" in the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'',
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.
#Therefore to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes.
#The qualities of bodies, which admit neither intension nor remission of degrees, and which are found to belong to all bodies within the reach of our experiments, are to be esteemed the universal qualities of all bodies whatsoever.
#In experimental philosophy we are to look upon propositions collected by general induction from phænomena as accurately or very nearly true, notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses that may be imagined, until such time as other phænomena occur, by which they may either be made more accurate, or liable to exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Rule IV, [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica#Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy]]:
*Newton states "This rule we must follow that the argument of induction may not be evaded by hypotheses", in the Motte translation (p. 400 in the Cajori revision, volume 2)
*Newton's comment is also rendered as "This rule should be followed so that arguments based on induction may not be nullified by hypotheses" on p. 796 of {{Citation|last=Newton|first=Isaac|year=1999|author-link=Isaac Newton|title=[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]|publisher=University of California Press| isbn= 0-520-08817-4}}, Third edition: 1687, 1713, 1726. From [[I. Bernard Cohen]] and Anne Whitman's 1999 translation, 974 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Newton also left an admonition about a [[theory of everything]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. 'Tis much better to do a little with certainty, and leave the rest for others that come after you, than to explain all things.&lt;ref&gt;
Statement from unpublished notes for the Preface to ''Opticks'' (1704) quoted in ''Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton'' (1983) by Richard S. Westfall, p.&amp;nbsp;643
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Newton's work became a model that other sciences sought to emulate, and his inductive approach formed the basis for much of natural philosophy through the 18th and early 19th centuries.  Some methods of reasoning were later systematized by [[Mill's Methods]] (or Mill's canon), which are five explicit statements of what can be discarded and what can be kept while building a hypothesis. [[George Boole]] and [[William Stanley Jevons]] also wrote on the principles of reasoning.

==Integrating deductive and inductive method==
Attempts to systematize a scientific method were confronted in the mid-18th century by the [[problem of induction]], a [[logical positivist|positivist]] logic formulation which, in short, asserts that nothing can be known with certainty except what is actually observed.  [[David Hume]] took empiricism to the skeptical extreme; among his positions was that there is no logical necessity that the future should resemble the past, thus we are unable to justify inductive reasoning itself by appealing to its past success. Hume's arguments, of course, came on the heels of many, many centuries of excessive speculation upon excessive speculation not grounded in empirical observation and testing.  Many of Hume's radically skeptical arguments were argued against, but not resolutely refuted, by  [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "Hume awakened Kant from his dogmatic slumbers"]&lt;/ref&gt; Hume's arguments continue to hold a strong lingering influence and certainly on the consciousness of the educated classes for the better part of the 19th century when the argument at the time became the focus on whether or not the inductive method was valid.

[[Hans Christian Ørsted]], (Ørsted is the [[Danish language|Danish]] spelling; ''Oersted'' in other languages) (1777–1851) was heavily influenced by Kant, in particular, Kant's ''[[Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft]]'' (''Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science'').&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The following sections on Ørsted encapsulate our current, common view of [[scientific method]]. His work appeared in Danish, most accessibly in public lectures, which he translated into German, French, English, and occasionally Latin. But some of his views go beyond Kant:

:"In order to achieve completeness in our knowledge of nature, we must start from two extremes, from experience and from the intellect itself. ... The former method must conclude with natural laws, which it has abstracted from experience, while the latter must begin with principles, and gradually, as it develops more and more, it becomes ever more detailed. Of course, I speak here about the method as manifested in the process of the human intellect itself, not as found in textbooks, where the laws of nature which have been abstracted from the consequent experiences are placed first because they are required to explain the experiences. When the empiricist in his regression towards general laws of nature meets the metaphysician in his progression, science will reach its perfection."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Ørsted's "First Introduction to General Physics" (1811) exemplified the steps of [[observation]],&lt;ref&gt;
"The foundation of general physics ... is experience. These ... everyday experiences we do not discover without deliberately directing our attention to them. Collecting information about these is ''observation''." – [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]("First Introduction to General Physics" ¶13, part of a series of public lectures at the University of Copenhagen. Copenhagen 1811, in Danish, printed by Johan Frederik Schulz.

"When it is not clear under which law of nature an effect or class of effect belongs, we try to fill this gap by means of a guess. Such guesses have been given the name ''conjectures'' or ''[[hypotheses]]''." – [[Hans Christian Ørsted]](1811) "First Introduction to General Physics" ¶18.  ''Selected Scientific Works of Hans Christian Ørsted'', {{ISBN|0-691-04334-5}} p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]&lt;ref&gt;
"The student of nature ... regards as his property the experiences which the mathematician can only borrow. This is why he deduces theorems directly from the nature of an effect while the mathematician only arrives at them circuitously." – [[Hans Christian Ørsted]](1811) "First Introduction to General Physics" ¶17.  ''Selected Scientific Works of Hans Christian Ørsted'', {{ISBN|0-691-04334-5}} p. 297
&lt;/ref&gt; and experiment.  In 1805, based on his researches on [[electromagnetism]] Ørsted came to believe that electricity is propagated by undulatory action (i.e., fluctuation). By 1820, he felt confident enough in his beliefs that he resolved to demonstrate them in a public lecture, and in fact observed a small magnetic effect from a galvanic circuit (i.e., voltaic circuit), ''without rehearsal'';&lt;ref&gt;

In 1831 [[John Herschel]] (1792–1871) published ''A Preliminary Discourse on the study of Natural Philosophy'', setting out the principles of science. Measuring and comparing observations was to be used to find generalisations in "empirical laws", which described regularities in phenomena, then natural philosophers were to work towards the higher aim of finding a universal "law of nature" which explained the causes and effects producing such regularities. An explanatory hypothesis was to be found by evaluating true causes (Newton's "vera causae") derived from experience, for example evidence of past climate change could be due to changes in the shape of continents, or to changes in Earth's orbit. Possible causes could be inferred by analogy to known causes of similar phenomena.&lt;ref name="Young 07"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Young | first1 = David | title = The discovery of evolution | year = 2007 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 0-521-68746-2 | pages = 105–106, 113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Herschel | first = John Frederick William | title = A Preliminary Discourse on the study of Natural Philosophy | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=1&amp;itemID=A276&amp;viewtype=text | series = [[Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopædia]]

[[William Whewell]] (1794–1866) regarded his ''History of the Inductive Sciences, from the Earliest to the Present Time'' (1837) to be an introduction to the ''Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences'' (1840) which analyzes the method exemplified in the formation of ideas. Whewell attempts to follow Bacon's plan for discovery of an effectual art of discovery. He named the [[hypothetico-deductive method]] (which ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' credits to Newton&lt;ref&gt;
"Science, Philosophy of", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Fifteenth Ed. (1979) {{ISBN|0-85229-297-X}} pp. 378–9
&lt;/ref&gt;); Whewell also coined the term ''scientist''. Whewell examines ideas and attempts to construct science by uniting ideas to facts. He analyses induction into three steps:
#the selection of the fundamental idea, such as [[space]], [[number]], [[cause]], or likeness
#a more special modification of those ideas, such as a [[circle]], a uniform [[force]], etc.
#the determination of magnitudes
Upon these follow special techniques applicable for quantity, such as the [[method of least squares]], [[curve]]s, [[mean]]s, and special methods depending on resemblance (such as [[pattern matching]], the method of gradation, and the method of natural classification (such as [[cladistics]]).
But no art of discovery, such as Bacon anticipated, follows, for "[[invention]], [[wikt:sagacity|sagacity]], [[genius]]" are needed at every step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Whewell, William |volume=28 |page=587}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Whewell's sophisticated concept of science had similarities to that shown by Herschel, and he considered that a good hypothesis should connect fields that had previously been thought unrelated, a process he called [[consilience]]. However, where Herschel held that the [[evolution|origin of new biological species]] would be found in a natural rather than a miraculous process, Whewell opposed this and considered that no natural cause had been shown for [[adaptation]] so an unknown [[teleological argument|divine cause]] was appropriate.&lt;ref name="Young 07" /&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873) was stimulated to publish ''A System of Logic'' (1843) upon reading Whewell's ''History of the Inductive Sciences''. Mill may be regarded as the final exponent of the empirical school of philosophy begun by [[John Locke]], whose fundamental characteristic is the duty incumbent upon all thinkers to investigate for themselves rather than to accept the authority of others. Knowledge must be based on experience.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Mill, John Stuart |volume=18 |page=458}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century [[Claude Bernard]] was also influential, especially in bringing the scientific method to medicine. In his discourse on scientific method, ''An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine'' (1865), he described what makes a scientific theory good and what makes a scientist a true discoverer. Unlike many scientific writers of his time, Bernard wrote about his own experiments and thoughts, and used the first person.&lt;ref&gt;All page references refer to the Dover edition of 1957.

[[William Stanley Jevons]]' ''The Principles of Science: a treatise on logic and scientific method'' (1873, 1877) Chapter XII "The Inductive or Inverse Method", Summary of the Theory of Inductive Inference, states "Thus there are but three steps in the process of induction :-
#Framing some hypothesis as to the character of the general law.
#Deducing some consequences of that law.
#Observing whether the consequences agree with the particular tasks under consideration."
Jevons then frames those steps in terms of probability, which he then applied to economic laws. [[Ernest Nagel]] notes that Jevons and Whewell were not the first writers to argue for the centrality of the [[hypothetico-deductive method]] in the logic of science.&lt;ref&gt;

===Charles Sanders Peirce===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}

In the late 19th century, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] proposed a schema that would turn out to have considerable influence in the further development of scientific method generally.  Peirce's work quickly accelerated the progress on several fronts. Firstly, speaking in broader context in "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" (1878),&lt;ref&gt;Charles S. Peirce [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/ideas/id-frame.htm How to Make Our Ideas Clear], Popular Science Monthly 12 (January 1878), pp. 286–302&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce outlined an objectively verifiable method to test the truth of putative knowledge on a way that goes beyond mere foundational alternatives, focusing upon both [[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]] and [[Induction (philosophy)|Induction]].  He thus placed induction and deduction in a complementary rather than competitive context (the latter of which had been the primary trend at least since [[David Hume]] a century before).  Secondly, and of more direct importance to scientific method, Peirce put forth the basic schema for hypothesis-testing that continues to prevail today.  Extracting the theory of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic, he refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address the then-current problems in scientific reasoning. Peirce examined and articulated the three fundamental modes of reasoning that play a role in scientific inquiry today, the processes that are currently known as [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference.  Thirdly, he played a major role in the progress of symbolic logic itself – indeed this was his primary specialty.

Charles S. Peirce was also a pioneer in [[statistics]]. Peirce held that science achieves statistical probabilities, not certainties, and that chance, a veering from law, is very real. He assigned probability to an argument’s conclusion rather than to a proposition, event, etc., as such. Most of his statistical writings promote the [[Frequency probability|frequency interpretation]] of probability (objective ratios of cases), and many of his writings express skepticism about (and criticize the use of) [[statistical model|probability]] when such models are not based on objective [[randomization]].&lt;ref&gt;Peirce condemned the use of "certain [[likelihood function|likelihoods]]" even more strongly than he criticized [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian methods]]. Indeed Peirce used [[Bayesian inference]] in criticizing parapsychology.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Peirce was largely a frequentist, his [[possible world semantics]] introduced the "[[propensity]]" theory of probability. Peirce (sometimes with [[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow]]) investigated the [[Bayesian probability|probability judgments]] of experimental subjects, pioneering [[decision analysis]].

Peirce was one of the [[founders of statistics]]. He formulated modern statistics in "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#illus|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]]" (1877–1878) and "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|A Theory of Probable Inference]]" (1883). With a [[repeated measures design]], he introduced [[blinding (medicine)|blinded]], [[Randomized controlled trial|controlled randomized experiments]] (before [[Ronald A. Fisher|Fisher]]). He invented an [[optimal design]] for experiments on gravity, in which he "[[analysis of variance|corrected the means]]". He used [[logistic regression]], [[correlation]], and [[smoothing]], and improved the treatment of [[Peirce's criterion|outliers]]. He introduced terms "[[Confidence interval|confidence]]" and "[[Likelihood function|likelihood]]" (before [[Jerzy Neyman|Neyman]] and [[Ronald A. Fisher|Fisher]]). (See the historical books of [[Stephen Stigler]].) Many of Peirce's ideas were later popularized and developed by [[Ronald A. Fisher]], [[Jerzy Neyman]], [[Frank P. Ramsey]], [[Bruno de Finetti]], and [[Karl Popper]].

===Popper and Kuhn===
[[Karl Popper]] (1902–1994) is generally credited with providing major improvements in the understanding of the scientific method in the mid-to-late 20th century. In 1934 Popper published ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', which repudiated the by then traditional observationalist-inductivist account of the scientific method. He advocated empirical [[falsifiability]] as the criterion for distinguishing scientific work from [[non-science]]. According to Popper, scientific theory should make predictions (preferably predictions not made by a competing theory) which can be tested and the theory rejected if these predictions are shown not to be correct. Following Peirce and others, he argued that science would best progress using deductive reasoning as its primary emphasis, known as [[critical rationalism]].  His astute formulations of logical procedure helped to rein in the excessive use of inductive speculation upon inductive speculation, and also helped to strengthen the conceptual foundations for today's [[peer review]] procedures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Critics of Popper, chiefly [[Thomas Kuhn]], [[Paul Feyerabend]] and [[Imre Lakatos]], rejected the idea that there exists a ''single'' method that applies to all science and could account for its progress. In 1962 Kuhn published the influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' which suggested that scientists worked within a series of paradigms, and argued there was little evidence of scientists actually following a falsificationist methodology. Kuhn quoted [[Max Planck]] who had said in his autobiography, "a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck]] (1949) ''Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers'', pp. 33–34 {{ISBN|0-8371-0194-8}}, as cited by {{Citation|first=Thomas|last=Kuhn|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|page=151|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1997|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These debates clearly show that there is no universal agreement as to what constitutes ''the'' "scientific method".&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Wellington, ''Secondary Science: Contemporary Issues and Practical Approaches'' (Routlege, 1994, p. 41)&lt;/ref&gt;  There remain, nonetheless, certain [[scientific method#Elements of the scientific method|core principles]] that are the foundation of scientific inquiry today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gauch |first1= Hugh G. |title=Scientific Method in Practice |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iVkugqNG9dAC |edition=Reprint |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2003 |page=3 |isbn=9780521017084 |quote=The scientific method 'is often misrepresented as a fixed sequence of steps,' rather than being seen for what it truly is, 'a highly variable and creative process' (AAAS 2000:18). The claim here is that science has general principles that must be mastered to increase productivity and enhance perspective, not that these principles provide a simple and automated sequence of steps to follow.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mention of the topic==
In ''Quod Nihil Scitur'' (1581), [[Francisco Sanches]] refers to another book title, ''De modo sciendi'' (on the method of knowing). This work appeared in Spanish as ''Método universal de las ciencias''.&lt;ref name="modoSciendi"/&gt;

In 1833 [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert]] and [[William Chambers (publisher)|William Chambers]] published their 'Chambers's information for the people'. Under the rubric 'Logic' we find a description of investigation that is familiar as scientific method,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Investigation, or the art of inquiring into the nature of causes and their operation, is a leading characteristic of reason [...] Investigation implies three things – Observation, Hypothesis, and Experiment [...] The first step in the process, it will be perceived, is to observe...&lt;ref&gt;William Chambers, Robert Chambers, ''Chambers's information for the people: a popular encyclopaedia'', Volume 1, pp. 363–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1885, the words "Scientific method" appear together with a description of the method in [[Francis Ellingwood Abbot]]'s 'Scientific Theism',

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now all the established truths which are formulated in the multifarious propositions of science have been won by the use of Scientific Method. This method consists in essentially three distinct steps (1) observation and experiment, (2) hypothesis, (3) verification by fresh observation and experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Ellingwood Abbot, ''Scientific Theism'' p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Eleventh Edition of ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' did not include an article on scientific method; the Thirteenth Edition listed scientific management, but not method. By the Fifteenth Edition, a 1-inch article in the ''Micropædia'' of Britannica was part of the 1975 printing, while a fuller treatment (extending across multiple articles, and accessible mostly via the index volumes of Britannica) was available in later printings.&lt;ref&gt;
''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Fifteenth Edition {{ISBN|0-85229-493-X}} Index L-Z "scientific method" pp. 588–9
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current issues==
In the past few centuries, [[decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|some statistical methods]] have been developed, for reasoning in the face of uncertainty, as an outgrowth of methods for eliminating error. This was an echo of the program of Francis Bacon's ''[[Novum Organum]]'' of 1620. [[Bayesian inference]] acknowledges one's ability to alter one's beliefs in the face of evidence. This has been called [[belief revision]], or [[defeasible reasoning]]: the models in play during the phases of scientific method can be reviewed, revisited and revised, in the light of further evidence. This arose from the work of [[Frank P. Ramsey]]&lt;ref&gt;A review and defense of [[Frank P.Ramsey]]'s formulation can be found in [http://philrsss.anu.edu.au/people-defaults/alanh/papers/scotching.pdf Alan Hájek, "Scotching Dutch Books?" ''Philosophical Perspectives'' '''19''']&lt;/ref&gt;
(1903–1930), of [[John Maynard Keynes]]&lt;ref&gt;[[John Maynard Keynes]](1921) ''Treatise on Probability''&lt;/ref&gt;
(1883–1946), and earlier, of [[William Stanley Jevons]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[William Stanley Jevons]](1888) ''The Theory of Political Economy''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Stanley Jevons]](1874), ''The Principles of Science'', p. 267, reprinted by Dover in 1958
&lt;/ref&gt; (1835–1882) in economics.

==Science and pseudoscience==
The question of how [[science]] operates and therefore how to [[Demarcation problem|distinguish]] genuine science from [[pseudoscience]] has importance well beyond scientific circles or the academic community. In the [[judicial system]] and in [[public policy]] controversies, for example, a study's deviation from ''accepted scientific practice'' is grounds for rejecting it as [[junk science]] or pseudoscience. However, the high public perception of science means that pseudoscience is widespread. An advertisement in which an actor wears a white coat and product ingredients are given Greek or Latin sounding names is intended to give the impression of scientific endorsement. [[Richard Feynman]] has likened pseudoscience to [[cargo cult]]s in which many of the external forms are followed, but the underlying basis is missing: that is, fringe or alternative theories often present themselves with a pseudoscientific appearance to gain acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm R.P. Feynman (1974) "Cargo cult science"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hope''' is a feminine name derived from the [[Middle English language|Middle English]] ''[[hope]],'' ultimately from the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''hopian''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hope&lt;/ref&gt; referring to a positive expectation or to the theological virtue of [[hope (virtue)|hope]]. It was used as a virtue name by the [[Puritans]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.behindthename.com/name/hope&lt;/ref&gt; Puritans also used Hope as an element in phrase names, such as Hope-for, Hopeful, and Hope-still.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.namenerds.com/uucn/listofweek/puritan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is also the usual [[English language|English]] translation of the [[Greek language|Greek]] name of [[Saints Faith, Hope and Charity|Saint Hope]], an early Christian child [[martyr]] who was tortured to death along with her sisters Faith and Charity. She is known as Elpis in [[Koine Greek|Greek]] and Spes in [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Church Latin]] and her name is translated differently in other languages.

[[Faith (given name)|Faith]], Hope and [[Charity (name)|Charity]], the [[theological virtues|three theological virtues]], are names traditionally given to [[Multiple birth|triplet]] girls, just as Faith and Hope remain common names for [[twin]] girls. There were 40 sets of twins named Faith and Hope born in the [[United States]] in 2009, the second most common name combination for twin girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/twins.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201174159/http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/twins.html |archivedate=2012-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example were the American triplets Faith, Hope and Charity Cardwell, who were born in 1899 in [[Texas]] and were recognized in 1994 by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the world's longest lived triplets.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/garden/at-home-with-faith-hope-and-charity-285-years-young.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Hope has been among the top 1,000 names given to girls born in the [[United States]] since 1880 and has been among the top 500 since 1909. It was ranked as the 231st most popular name for girls born in 2011 in the United States, down from its peak ranking of No. 144 in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/babyname.cgi&lt;/ref&gt;

'''I Am Equal''' is a photo documentary created by Jason Beckett and fashion photographer Matt Spencer in late 2009. The project has the stated intention of collecting more than 100,000 individual photos from 175 cities around the world and using them to build one of the largest photo mosaics in history.&lt;ref name="Fox13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://downtown.fox13now.com/content/i-am-equal-project-utah|title=I AM EQUAL Project in Utah|last=Green-Miner|first=Brittany|date=2011-02-05|work=|access-date=2018-01-01|archive-url=https://archive.fo/p95gX|archive-date=2013-01-23|dead-url=yes|publisher=FOX 13 Now Downtown SLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the project launched the official world tour in [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref name=CapRadio1 /&gt; The project is estimated to take more than 7 years to complete and has the ultimate goal of unveiling an 8,000sq/ft mosaic in Washington DC containing all the photos collected during the world tour.&lt;ref name=SLTribune1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox401 /&gt;

==History==
The  documentary was created by Jason Beckett and fashion photographer Matt Spencer who said the campaign was meant to encourage individuals to get more active in educating, inspiring, and empowering their friends and family to make a positive difference in their communities and the world.&lt;ref name=thatssogay /&gt;

===The Project===
Created in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]] in late 2009, the campaign was developed in response to the founder's perceptions of a general social apathy prevailing in the world.&lt;ref name=CapRadio1&gt;Jeffery Callison (January 4, 2011) [http://www.capradio.org/156913 "Insight Radio Interview"], Capital Public Radio&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SLTribune1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox401 /&gt; They built the documentary with the intention of giving participants a reason to talk about the unique issues or causes they support, and to encourage those participants to take an active roll in improving their community.&lt;ref name=thatssogay /&gt;

In December 2009  Beckett and   Spencer  conceptualized the documentary project as a world tour campaign that would visit approximately 25 cities a year for 7 years and capture as many as 100,000&lt;ref name=SLTribune1&gt;Rosemary Winters (2011). [http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=13427146&amp;itype=storyID "SLC-based photo project spreads message of equality"], Salt Lake Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; individual photos of people from all walks of life.&lt;ref name=Jasper2 /&gt;

Beginning in January 2010,  Spencer started taking photos and testing the concept at his studio in Salt Lake City, Utah with only a few dozen photos at a time while  Beckett started to build the associated websites and social media pages .&lt;ref name=thatssogay /&gt;

In January 2011, after 8 small events in Utah, the project launched its official world tour in [[Sacramento, California]] at The Citizen Hotel.&lt;ref name=SLTribune1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox401 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Outword1&gt;Andrew Windchanz (January 2011) [http://anax8a.pressmart.com/Outword/index.aspx?issue=issue28&amp;page=11 "I Am Equal: The Picture of Equality Launches in Sacramento"], Outword Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Photos====
To participate in the campaign, individuals are encouraged to wear a solid brightly colored shirt and go to a public photo event&lt;ref&gt;Tony Hobday (February 2011) [http://qsaltlake.com/2011/02/03/we-are-equal/ "We Are Equal"], QSalt Lake Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; in their area where a temporary tattoo with the logo "I AM =" is applied to the palm of their hand.&lt;ref name=Fox13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jasper2 /&gt; They stand in front of the camera with the instructions to have the palm of their hand facing the camera as close to the face as possible, and they may be as creative as they want.&lt;ref name=CapRadio1 /&gt; The photographer snaps the photo and the entire process takes less than 5 minutes.&lt;ref name=Fox13 /&gt; Two weeks after the photo event, each participant receives an email with instructions on how to find their photo in the online gallery and social networks along with ideas on how to share it with friends and family. Each individual is also invited to share a "PhotoStory" as part of the photo essay project, where participants discuss the unique issues and causes they support.&lt;ref name=CapRadio1 /&gt;

====Broad inclusion====
The project creators said it is their first priority to ensure that it represents all people, issues, and causes rather than just the popular equality topic of the day.&lt;ref name=SLCTribune2&gt;Rosemary Winters (2011). [http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogslgbt/51191161-61/project-rights-equality-lake.html.csp "Equality photo project coming to SLC"], Salt Lake City Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; The expressed intention of the campaign is to get participants to speak up and discuss, with friends and family, the humanitarian, civil rights, conservation, and equality issues they support.&lt;ref name=thatssogay /&gt; They   point out that through history the conversation of "equality" has had many causal champions such as the Women's [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Suffragette Movement]], the [[Abolitionism|Abolitionist movement]], the [[Women's rights|Women's Rights movement]], the [[Civil Rights]], and the [[Gay rights in the United States|Gay &amp; Lesbian movement]], so the I Am Equal Photo Documentary was built to connect all of the issues of equality, human rights, civil liberties, and conservation into one massive conversation of mutual respect for all people while uniting individual participants in a common initiative to break a world record.&lt;ref name=CapRadio1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SLTribune1 /&gt;

Some of the issues and causes already represented by individuals participating in the I AM EQUAL Photo Documentary include autism, marriage equality, drug addiction, immigration reform, atheism, religious freedom, teen suicide, Downs Syndrome, gender equality, racism, poverty, incest rape, gay adoption, deaf/hearing impaired, bigotry, pansexuality, obesity, free speech, senior rights.&lt;ref name=Outword1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SLCTribune2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=QVegas1 /&gt;

====Photo activism====
The campaign leverages the popularity of   [[social networks]] to fuel the viral expansion of the project;   participants are encouraged to use their photo on  social media networks&lt;ref name=SLTribune1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=thatssogay /&gt; as a way to initiate conversations about the issue or cause represented by the individual.&lt;ref name=CapRadio1 /&gt; Some participants have taken their photo beyond the social networks by printing it on business cards or framing it in their house as a way to open a casual dialogue about their participation in the campaign.&lt;ref name=Fox401 /&gt;

The project founders assert that the simple act of sharing the photo or putting it on display may be all that is needed to open new conversations with co-workers, friends, family, and even perfect strangers about the big and small issues that these participants feel are facing the world today.&lt;ref name=CapRadio1 /&gt; Some participants have suggested that their I AM EQUAL photo has been an effective way to begin a dialogue on weightier human rights issues such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[sex trafficking]], [[Incest|rape incest]], [[polygamy]], and many other topics they feel would not normally be discussed in casual conversations.&lt;ref name=Fox401 /&gt;

===Milestones===

====World Tour 2011 (Year 1)====
In conjunction with Mayor Kevin Johnson's office and coordinating with the local Pride! Center, [[NAACP]], [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brothers Big Sisters]], and the [[United Way of America|United Way]], the photo documentary launched its first official tour stop on January 6, 2011, at The Citizen Hotel in Sacramento, California, the city TIME Magazine voted it to be the most diverse city in America.&lt;ref name=CapRadio1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox401 /&gt;

The project returned to Salt Lake City and held a general public photo event on February 5, 2011, at The Sheraton Downtown Hotel&lt;ref name=Fox13 /&gt; where an additional 650 photos were added to the documentary collection. The project made its way to Las Vegas, Nevada, in partnership with [[MGM Resorts International]]&lt;ref name=QVegas1&gt;Staff Writer (February 2011) [http://issuu.com/qvegas/docs/qvegas_february_2011/13 "I AM EQUAL Project comes to Las Vegas"], Q Vegas Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; for an event at [[New York-New York Hotel and Casino|The New York New York Hotel &amp; Casino]] on February 19, 2011, where more than 500 resort employees participated in the documentary project along with the then Mayor [[Oscar Goodman]], County Commissioner [[Chris Giunchigliani]], the dance troop The [[JabbaWockeeZ|Jabbawockeez]], as well as [[Terry Fator]], and the Las Vegas cast of [[The Lion King]] at Mandalay Bay. While in Las Vegas, project founder Jason Beckett was invited to discuss the photo documentary project as a speaker at the annual [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day|Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] celebrations, Jazzitudes at UNLV.&lt;ref name="rebel"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lister|first=Nolan|title=Black history celebration channels ‘dream’|publisher=UNLV Rebel Yell|date=2011-02-24|url=http://unlvrebelyell.com/2011/02/24/black-history-celebration-channels-%E2%80%98dream%E2%80%99/|accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project made its first stop outside the United States in Calgary, Alberta, Canada   on May 28, 2011. During this stop, hundreds participated in the project including United States Olympic Gold Medalist, [[Steve Mesler]] on behalf of his non-profit organization Classroom Champions. Local service groups and organizations including the [[United Way of Canada]], Child Find Alberta, AIDS Calgary, and the Calgary Scope Society all participated in the documentary project.&lt;ref name="thatssogay"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kassa|first=Hanna|title=I AM EQUAL project in Calgary |publisher=That's So Gay|date=2011-05-19|url=http://cjsw.com/program/thats-so-gay/i-am-equal-project-calgary/|accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with the North Texas chapter of Get Equal, the I Am Equal Photo Documentary set up at the Aloft Dallas Hotel and took photos of more than 300 people. Project founder   Beckett was invited to address the assembled crowd at the annual North Texas March for Equality on the steps of City Hall as the keynote speaker for the event.&lt;ref name="NTDaily"&gt;{{cite news|last=Macon|first=Alex|title=March in downtown Dallas promotes rights for LGBT community|publisher=NT Daily|date=2011-05-29|url=http://www.ntdaily.com/?p=55481|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World Tour 2012 (Year 2)====
The   project was invited to the University of North Florida   as part of their first annual 'Week of One' diversity celebration, created in part as a vehicle to showcase the   project and allow students the opportunity to take part in the record-breaking campaign.&lt;ref name="arbus1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wagner |first=Madeleine|title=Beauty In Diversity = I AMEQUAL At UNF |publisher=ARBUS Magazine|date=December 2011 – January 2012|url=http://vpub.boyd-printing.com/display_article.php?id=913642|accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, the campaign made stops in Raleigh, North Carolina, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Columbus, Ohio. While in Tennessee, the project founders made a detour to stop in the small town of Whitwell&lt;ref name="Jasper2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Doss|first=Nicholas|title=Whitwell participates in record breaking photo documentary |publisher=Jasper Journal|date=March 6, 2012|url=http://marioncountynews.net/whitwell-participates-in-record-breaking-photo-documentary-p2628-98.htm|accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include this community of 1,600 people in the project. The founders wanted to include the people responsible for creating the Children's Holocaust Memorial ([[Paper Clips Project]]), created by students at the local middle school who collected more than 11 million paperclips from around the world and placed them into a rail car used to transport Jews, blacks, homosexuals, Jehova's Witnesses, and other people to concentration camps. The original teacher from the project, David Alan Smith, as well as the local elected and school officials took part in the campaign by getting their photo taken at the City Hall Court Room.&lt;ref name="Jasper1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Doss|first=Nicholas|title=Whitwell to host record breaking photo shoot for documentary |publisher=Jasper Journal|date=February 21, 2012|url=http://marioncountynews.net/whitwell-to-host-record-breaking-photo-shoot-for-documentary-p2610-98.htm|accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PARAMOUNT Eli Lilly Informed Consent Document.djvu|thumbnail|right|Example of informed consent document from the [[PARAMOUNT trial]]]]
'''Informed consent''' is a process for getting permission before conducting a healthcare intervention on a person, or for disclosing personal information. A [[health care provider]] may ask a patient to [[consent]] to receive [[therapy]] before providing it, or a [[clinical research]]er may ask a [[research participant]] before enrolling that person into a [[clinical trial]]. Informed consent is collected according to guidelines from the fields of [[medical ethics]] and [[research ethics]].

An informed consent can be said to have been given based upon a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and consequences of an action. Adequate informed consent is rooted in respecting a person’s dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elsayyad|first=Ahmed|title=Informed Consent for Comparative Effectiveness Trials|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1403310|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=370|doi=10.1056/NEJMc1403310|pages=1958–1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; To give informed consent, the individual concerned must have adequate reasoning faculties and be in possession of all relevant facts. Impairments to reasoning and judgment that may prevent informed consent include basic intellectual or emotional immaturity, high levels of stress such as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) or a severe [[intellectual disability]], severe [[mental disorder]], [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], severe [[sleep deprivation]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], or being in a [[coma]].

Obtaining informed consent is [[#Waiver of requirement|not always required]]. If an individual is considered unable to give informed consent, another person is generally authorized to give consent on his behalf, e.g., parents or [[legal guardian]]s of a child (though in this circumstance the child may be required to provide [[informed assent]]) and conservators for the [[mentally disordered]], or consent can be assumed through the doctrine of [[implied consent]], e.g., when an unconscious person will die without immediate medical treatment.

In cases where an individual is provided insufficient information to form a reasoned decision, serious ethical issues arise. Such cases in a [[clinical trial]] in [[medical research]] are anticipated and prevented by an [[ethics committee]] or [[Institutional Review Board]].

Informed Consent Form Templates can be found on the World Health Organization Website for practical use.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/rpc/research_ethics/informed_consent/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; Informed Consent Form Templates|publisher=who.int|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==

Informed consent can be complex to evaluate, because neither expressions of consent, nor expressions of understanding of implications, necessarily mean that full adult consent was in fact given, nor that full comprehension of relevant issues is internally digested. Consent may be implied within the usual subtleties of human communication, rather than explicitly negotiated verbally or in writing. In some cases consent cannot legally be possible, even if the person protests he does indeed understand and wish. There are also structured instruments for evaluating capacity to give informed consent, although no ideal instrument presently exists.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Thus, there is always a degree to which informed consent must be assumed or inferred based upon observation, or knowledge, or legal reliance. This especially is the case in sexual or relational issues. In medical or formal circumstances, explicit agreement by means of signature—normally relied on legally—regardless of actual consent, is the norm. This is the case with certain procedures, such as a "[[do not resuscitate]]" directive that a patient signed before onset of their illness.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} 

Brief examples of each of the above:
# A person may verbally agree to something from fear, perceived social pressure, or psychological difficulty in asserting true feelings. The person requesting the action may honestly be unaware of this and believe the consent is genuine, and rely on it. ''Consent is expressed, but not internally given.''
# A person may claim to understand the implications of some action, as part of consent, but in fact has failed to appreciate the possible consequences fully and may later deny the validity of the consent for this reason. ''Understanding needed for informed consent is present but is, in fact (through ignorance), not present.''
# A person signs a [[legal release]] form for a [[medical procedure]], and later feels he did not really consent. Unless he can show actual misinformation, the release is usually persuasive or conclusive in law, in that the clinician may rely legally upon it for consent. ''In formal circumstances, a written consent usually legally overrides later denial of informed consent (unless obtained by misrepresentation)''.
# Informed consent in the U.S. can be overridden in emergency medical situations pursuant to [[21CFR50.24]], which was first brought to the general public's attention via the controversy surrounding the study of [[Polyheme]].

==Valid elements==

For an individual to give valid informed consent, three components must be present: disclosure, capacity and voluntariness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faden |first=R. R. |last2=Beauchamp |first2=T. L. |title=A History and Theory of Informed Consent |year=1986 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-503686-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beauchamp |first=Tom L. |last2=Childress |first2=James F. |title=Principles of Biomedical Ethics |year=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |edition=Fourth |isbn=0-19-508536-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Disclosure'' requires the researcher to supply each prospective subject with the information necessary to make an autonomous decision and also to ensure that the subject adequate understands the information provided. This latter requirement implies that a written consent form be written in lay language suited for the comprehension skills of subject population, as well as assessing the level of understanding through conversation.
* ''Capacity'' pertains to the ability of the subject to both understand the information provided and form a reasonable judgment based on the potential consequences of his/her decision.
* ''Voluntariness'' refers to the subject’s right to freely exercise his/her decision making without being subjected to external pressure such as coercion, manipulation, or undue influence.

==Waiver of requirement==

Waiver of the consent requirement may be applied in certain circumstances where no foreseeable harm is expected to result from the study or when permitted by law, federal regulations, or if an ethical review committee has approved the non-disclosure of certain information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Council for International Organization of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) and World Health Organization (WHO) Geneva, Switzerland, 2002 |title=International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects |url=http://www.cioms.ch/publications/layout_guide2002.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823205120/http://www.cioms.ch/publications/layout_guide2002.pdf |archivedate=2010-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides studies with minimal risk, waivers of consent may be obtained in a military setting. According to 10 USC 980, the United States Code for the Armed Forces, Limitations on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects, a waiver of advanced informed consent may be granted by the Secretary of Defense if a research project would:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McManus, J.|author2=S.

These practices are part of what constitutes informed consent, and their history is the history of informed consent.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|60}}  They combine to form the modern concept of informed consent—which rose in response to particular incidents in modern research.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|60}}  Whereas various cultures in various places practiced informed consent, the modern concept of informed consent was developed by people who drew influence from [[Western culture|Western tradition]].&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|60}}

===Medical history===
Historians cite a series of medical guidelines to trace the history of informed consent in medical practice.

[[The Hippocratic Oath]], a 500&amp;nbsp;BC Greek text, was the first set of Western writings giving guidelines for the conduct of medical professionals. It advises that physicians conceal most information from patients to give the patients the best care.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|61}}  The rationale is a [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] model for care—the doctor knows better than the patient, and therefore should direct the patient's care, because the patient is not likely to have better ideas than the doctor.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|61}}

[[Henri de Mondeville]], a French surgeon who in the 14th century, wrote about medical practice. He traced his ideas to the Hippocratic Oath.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burns|first=Chester R.|title=Legacies in ethics and medicine|year=1977|publisher=Science History Publications|location=New York|isbn=9780882021669}} In this book see Mary Catherine Welborn's excerpts from her 1966 ''The long tradition: A study in fourteenth-century medical deontology''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Jay|title=The silent world of doctor and patient|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0801857805|pages=7–9|edition=Johns Hopkins Paperbacks|author2=Alexander Morgan Capron}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his recommendations were that doctors "promise a cure to every patient" in hopes that the good prognosis would inspire a good outcome to treatment.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|63}} Mondeville never mentioned getting consent, but did emphasize the need for the patient to have confidence in the doctor.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|63}} He also advised that when deciding therapeutically unimportant details the doctor should meet the patients' requests "so far as they do not interfere with treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burns|first=Chester R.|title=Legacies in ethics and medicine|year=1977|publisher=Science History Publications|location=New York|isbn=9780882021669}} In this book see De Mondeville's "On the morals and ethics of medicine" from ''Ethics in Medicine''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Rush]] was an 18th-century United States physician who was influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment]] cultural movement.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|65}} Because of this, he advised that doctors ought to share as much information as possible with patients. He recommended that doctors educate the public and respect a patient's informed decision to accept therapy.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|65}} There is no evidence that he supported seeking a consent from patients.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|65}} In a lecture titled "On the duties of patients to their physicians", he stated that patients should be strictly obedient to the physician's orders; this was representative of much of his writings.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|65}} John Gregory, Rush's teacher, wrote similar views that a doctor could best practice beneficence by making decisions for the patients without their consent.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|66}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=John|title=Lectures on the Duties and Qualifications of a Physician|year=1772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Percival]] was a British physician who published a book called ''Medical Ethics'' in 1803.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|68}} Percival was a student of the works of Gregory and various earlier Hippocratic physicians.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|68}} Like all previous works, Percival's ''Medical Ethics'' makes no mention of soliciting for the consent of patients or respecting their decisions.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|68}} Percival said that patients have a right to truth, but when the physician could provide better treatment by lying or withholding information, he advised that the physician do as he thought best.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|68}}

When the [[American Medical Association]] was founded they in 1847 produced a work called the first edition of the ''American Medical Association Code of Medical Ethics''.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|69}} Many sections of this book are verbatim copies of passages from Percival's ''Medical Ethics''.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|69}} A new concept in this book was the idea that physicians should fully disclose all patient details truthfully when talking to other physicians, but the text does not also apply this idea to disclosing information to patients.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|70}} Through this text, Percival's ideas became pervasive guidelines throughout the United States as other texts were derived from them.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|70}}

[[Worthington Hooker]] was an American physician who in 1849 published ''Physician and Patient''.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|70}} This medical ethics book was radical demonstrating understanding of the AMA's guidelines and Percival's philosophy and soundly rejecting all directives that a doctor should lie to patients.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|70}} In Hooker's view, benevolent deception is not fair to the patient, and he lectured widely on this topic.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|70}} Hooker's ideas were not broadly influential.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|70}}

===Research history===
Historians cite a series of [[human subject research]] experiments to trace the history of informed consent in research.

The U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission “is considered the first research group in history to use consent forms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cutter|first=Laura|title=Walter Reed, Yellow Fever, and Informed Consent|url=http://militarymedicine.amsus.org/doi/pdf/10.7205/MILMED-D-15-00430|journal=Military Medicine|volume=181|issue=1|pages=90–91|doi=10.7205/milmed-d-15-00430}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, Major [[Walter Reed]] was appointed head of the four man U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission in [[Cuba]] that determined [[Mosquito|mosquitoes]] were the vector for [[yellow fever]] transmission. His earliest experiments were probably done without formal documentation of informed consent. In later experiments he obtained support from appropriate military and administrative authorities. He then drafted what is now “one of the oldest series of extant informed consent documents.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/yellowfever/yellow-fever-commission-work/|title=The U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission in Cuba - U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission|last=|first=|date=|work=U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three surviving examples are in Spanish with English translations; two have an individual’s signature and one is marked with an X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/yellowfever/yellow-fever-commission-work/|title=The U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission in Cuba - U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission|work=U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tearoom Trade]]'' is the name of a book by American psychologist [[Laud Humphreys]]. In it he describes his research into male [[homosexual]] acts.&lt;ref name="babbie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Babbie|first=Earl|title=The practice of social research|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage|location=Belmont, Calif|isbn=0495598410|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conducting this research he never sought consent from his research subjects and other researchers raised concerns that he violated the right to [[privacy for research participants]].&lt;ref name="babbie"/&gt;

The [[Milgram experiment]] is the name of a 1961 experiment conducted by American psychologist [[Stanley Milgram]]. In the experiment Milgram had an authority figure order research participants to commit a disturbing act of harming another person.&lt;ref name="baumrind"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baumrind | first1 = D. | title = Some thoughts on ethics of research: After reading Milgram's "Behavioral Study of Obedience." | doi = 10.1037/h0040128 | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 421–423 | year = 1964 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the experiment he would reveal that he had deceived the participants and that they had not hurt anyone, but the research participants were upset at the experience of having participated in the research.&lt;ref name="baumrind"/&gt; The experiment raised broad discussion on the ethics of recruiting participants for research without giving them full information about the nature of the research.&lt;ref name="baumrind"/&gt;

[[Chester M. Southam]] used HeLa cells to inject into cancer patients and [[Ohio State Penitentiary]] inmates without informed consent to determine if people could become immune to cancer and if cancer could be transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skloot|first1=Rebecca|title=The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks|date=2010|publisher=Braodway Paperbacks|location=New York|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical procedures==
The doctrine of informed consent relates to [[professional negligence]] and establishes a breach of the duty of care owed to the patient (see [[duty of care in English law|duty of care]], [[breach of duty in English law|breach of the duty]], and [[respect for persons]]). The doctrine of informed consent also has significant implications for medical trials of medications, devices, or procedures.

===Requirements of the professional===
Until 2015 in the [[United Kingdom]] and in countries such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], informed consent in medical procedures requires proof as to the standard of care to expect as a recognised standard of acceptable professional practice (the [[Bolam Test]]), that is, what risks would a medical professional usually disclose in the circumstances (see [[Loss of right in English law]]). Arguably, this is "sufficient consent" rather than "informed consent." The UK has since departed from the Bolam test for judging standards of informed consent, due to the landmark ruling in ''[[Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board]]''. This moves away from the concept of a reasonable physician and instead uses the standard of a [[Reasonable person|reasonable patient]], and what risks an individual would attach significance to.

Medicine in the United States, Australia, and Canada also takes this patient-centric approach to "informed consent." Informed consent in these jurisdictions requires healthcare providers to disclose significant risks, as well as risks of particular importance to that patient. This approach combines an objective (a hypothetical reasonable patient) and subjective (this particular patient) approach.

The doctrine of informed consent should be contrasted with the general doctrine of medical consent, which applies to [[assault (tort)|assault]] or [[battery (tort)|battery]]. The consent standard here is only that the person understands, in general terms, the nature of and purpose of the intended intervention. As the higher standard of informed consent applies to negligence, not battery, the other elements of negligence must be made out. Significantly, causation must be shown: That had the individual been made aware of the risk he would not have proceeded with the operation (or perhaps with that surgeon).

Optimal establishment of an informed consent requires adaptation to cultural or other individual factors of the patient. For example, people from Mediterranean and Arab appear to rely more on the context of the delivery of the information, with the information being carried more by who is saying it and where, when, and how it's being said, rather than ''what'' is said, which is of relatively more importance in typical "Western" countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/746187?src=mp&amp;spon=25 Too Much Information: Informed Consent in Cultural Context]. By Joseph J. Fins and Pablo Rodriguez del Pozo. Medscape 07/18/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The informed consent doctrine is generally implemented through good healthcare practice: pre-operation discussions with patients and the use of medical consent forms in hospitals. However, reliance on a signed form should not undermine the basis of the doctrine in giving the patient an opportunity to weigh and respond to the risk. In one British case, a doctor performing routine surgery on a woman noticed that she had cancerous tissue in her womb. He took the initiative to remove the woman's womb; however, as she had not given informed consent for this operation, the doctor was judged by the [[General Medical Council]] to have acted negligently. The council stated that the woman should have been informed of her condition, and allowed to make her own decision.

===Obtaining informed consents===

To capture and manage informed consents, hospital management systems typically use paper-based consent forms which are scanned and stored in a document handling system after obtaining the necessary signatures. Hospital systems and research organizations are adopting an electronic way of capturing informed consents to enable indexing, to improve comprehension, search and retrieval of consent data, thus enhancing the ability to honor to patient intent and identify willing research participants.&lt;ref name="healthsciencessc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthsciencessc.org/IT.asp|title=Health Sciences South Carolina|publisher=healthsciencessc.org|accessdate=14 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011200835/http://healthsciencessc.org/IT.asp|archivedate=11 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chalil Madathil | first1 = K. | last2 = Koikkara | first2 = R. | last3 = Gramopadhye | first3 = A.

===Competency of the patient===

The ability to give informed consent is governed by a general requirement of competency. In common law jurisdictions, adults are presumed competent to consent. This presumption can be rebutted, for instance, in circumstances of mental illness or other incompetence. This may be prescribed in legislation or based on a common-law standard of inability to understand the nature of the procedure. In cases of incompetent adults, a [[health care proxy]] makes medical decisions. In the absence of a proxy, the medical practitioner is expected to act in the patient's best interests until a proxy can be found.

By contrast, '[[Minor (law)|minors]]' (which may be defined differently in different jurisdictions) are generally presumed incompetent to consent, but depending on their age and other factors may be required to provide [[Informed assent]]. In some jurisdictions (e.g. much of the U.S.), this is a strict standard. In other jurisdictions (e.g. England, Australia, Canada), this presumption may be rebutted through proof that the minor is ‘mature’ (the ‘[[Gillick competence|Gillick standard]]’). In cases of incompetent minors, informed consent is usually required from the parent (rather than the 'best interests standard') although a [[parens patriae]] order may apply, allowing the court to dispense with parental consent in cases of refusal.

===Deception===

Research involving deception is controversial given the requirement for informed consent. Deception typically arises in social psychology, when researching a particular psychological process requires that investigators deceive subjects. For example, in the [[Milgram experiment]], researchers wanted to determine the willingness of participants to obey authority figures despite their personal conscientious objections. They had authority figures demand that participants deliver what they thought was an electric shock to another research participant. For the study to succeed, it was necessary to deceive the participants so they believed that the subject was a peer and that their electric shocks caused the peer actual pain.

Nonetheless, research involving deception prevents subjects from exercising their basic right of autonomous informed decision-making and conflicts with the ethical principle of [[respect for persons]].

The [[Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct]] set by the [[American Psychological Association]] says that psychologists may conduct research that includes a deceptive compartment only if they can both justify the act by the value and importance of the study's results and show they could not obtain the results by some other way. Moreover, the research should bear no potential harm to the subject as an outcome of deception, either physical pain or [[emotional distress]]. Finally, the code requires a debriefing session in which the experimenter both tells the subject about the deception and gives subject the option of withdrawing the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=2. American Psychological Association. (2002)|title=2010 Amendments to the American Psychological Association ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct.|url=http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index.aspx|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===

In some U.S. states, informed consent laws (sometimes called "right to know" laws) require that a woman seeking an elective [[abortion]] receive information from the abortion provider about her legal rights, alternatives to abortion (such as [[adoption]]), available public and private assistance, and other information specified in the law, before the abortion is performed. Other countries with such laws (e.g. [[Germany]]) require that the information giver be properly certified to make sure that no abortion is carried out for the financial gain of the abortion provider and to ensure that the decision to have an abortion is not swayed by any form of incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taupitz |first1=Jochen |last2=Weschka |first2=Marion |date=2009 |title=CHIMBRIDS - Chimeras and Hybrids in Comparative European and International Research: Scientific, Ethical, Philosophical and Legal Aspects.

Some informed consent laws have been criticized for allegedly using "loaded language in an apparently deliberate attempt to 'personify' the fetus,"&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Rachel and Nash, Elizabeth.[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/10/4/gpr100406.html State Abortion Counseling Policies and the Fundamental Principles of Informed Consent], Guttmacher Policy Review, Fall 2007, Volume 10, Number 4.&lt;/ref&gt; but those critics acknowledge that "most of the information in the [legally mandated] materials about abortion comports with recent scientific findings and the principles of informed consent", although "some content is either misleading or altogether incorrect."&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Chinue and Nash, Elizabeth. [http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/09/4/gpr090406.html "Misinformed Consent: The Medical Accuracy of State-Developed Abortion Counseling Materials"], Guttmacher Policy Review
Fall 2006, Volume 9, Number 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==

As children often lack the decision making ability or legal power (competence) to provide true informed consent for medical decisions, it often falls on parents or legal guardians to provide ''informed permission'' for medical decisions. This "consent by proxy" usually works reasonably well, but can lead to ethical dilemmas when the judgment of the parents or guardians and the medical professional differ with regard to what constitutes appropriate decisions "in the best interest of the child". Children who are [[Emancipation of minors|legally emancipated]], and certain situations such as decisions regarding sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy, or for unemancipated minors who are deemed to have medical decision making capacity, may be able to provide consent without the need for parental permission depending on the laws of the jurisdiction the child lives in. The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] encourages medical professionals also to seek the assent of older children and adolescents by providing age appropriate information to these children to help empower them in the decision making process.&lt;ref name="AAP"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Committee on Bioethics  | year = 1995 | title = Informed consent, parental permission, and assent in pediatric practice | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/95/2/314.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 95 | issue = 2| pages = 314–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on children has benefited society in many ways. The only effective way to establish normal patterns of growth and metabolism is to do research on infants and young children. When addressing the issue of informed consent with children, the primary response is parental consent. This is valid, although only legal guardians are able to consent for a child, not adult siblings.&lt;ref name="Annas, Glantz, Katz 1977 63–93"&gt;{{cite book|last=Annas, Glantz, Katz|first=George, Leonard, Barbara|title=Informed Consent to Human Experimentation|year=1977|publisher=Ballinger Publishing Company|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-88410-147-9|pages=63–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, parents may not order the termination of a treatment that is required to keep a child alive, even if they feel it is in the best interest.&lt;ref name="Annas, Glantz, Katz 1977 63–93"/&gt;  Guardians are typically involved in the consent of children, however a number of doctrines have developed that allow children to receive health treatments without parental consent. For example, emancipated minors may consent to medical treatment, and minors can also consent in an emergency.&lt;ref name="Annas, Glantz, Katz 1977 63–93"/&gt;

==Research==
Informed consent is part of the ethical [[clinical research]] as well, in which a human subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular [[clinical trial]], after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate. Informed consent is documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6/E6_R1_Guideline.pdf |title=Guideline For Good Clinical Practice |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[medical research]], the [[Nuremberg Code]] set a base international standard in 1947, which continued to develop, for example in response to the ethical violation in the [[Holocaust]]. Nowadays, medical research is overseen by an [[ethics committee]] that also oversees the informed consent process.

As the medical guidelines established in the Nuremberg Code were imported into the ethical guidelines for the [[social science]]s, informed consent became a common part of the research procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Homan |first=R. |year=1991 |title=The Ethics of Social Research |location=London; New York |publisher=Longman |isbn=0-582-05879-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while informed consent is the default in medical settings, it is not always required in the social science. Here, research often involves low or no risk for participants, unlike in many medical experiments. Second, the mere knowledge that they participate in a study can cause people to alter their behavior, as in the [[Hawthorne Effect]]: "In the typical lab experiment, subjects enter an environment in which they are keenly aware that their behavior is being monitored, recorded, and subsequently scrutinized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levitt |first=S. D. |last2=List |first2=J. A. |year=2007 |title=What Do Laboratory Experiments Measuring Social Preferences Reveal about the Real World? |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=153–174 |doi= 10.1257/jep.21.2.153|jstor=30033722 |url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.21.2.153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}}
In such cases, seeking informed consent directly interferes with the ability to conduct the research, because the very act of revealing that a study is being conducted is likely to alter the behavior studied. List exemplifies the potential dilemma that can result: "if one were interested in exploring whether, and to what extent, race or gender influences the prices that buyers pay for used cars, it would be difficult to measure accurately the degree of discrimination among used car dealers who know that they are taking part in an experiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=List |first=J. A. |year=2008 |title=Informed Consent in Social Science |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=322 |issue=5902 |page=672 |doi=10.1126/science.322.5902.672a |last2=List |first2=J. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where such interference is likely, and after careful consideration, a researcher may forgo the informed consent process. This is commonly done after weighting the risk to study participants versus the benefit to society and whether participants are present in the study out of their own wish and treated fairly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levitt |first=S. D. |last2=List |first2=J. A. |year=2009 |title=Field experiments in economics: The past, the present, and the future |journal=[[European Economic Review]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2008.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers often consult with an ethics committee or institutional review board to render a decision.

The birth of new online media, such as social media, has complicated the idea of informed consent. In an online environment people pay little attention to Terms of Use agreements and can subject themselves to research without thorough knowledge. This issue came to the public light following a study conducted by [[Facebook|Facebook Inc.]] in 2014, and published by that company and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kramer|first1=Adam|last2=Guillory|first2=Jaime|last3=Jeffrey|first3=Hancock|title=Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks|journal=PNAS|date=2014|volume=111|doi=10.1073/pnas.1320040111|pmid=24889601|pages=8788–90|pmc=4066473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook conducted a study where they altered the Facebook News Feeds of roughly 700,000 users to reduce either the amount of positive or negative posts they saw for a week. The study then analyzed if the users status updates changed during the different conditions. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The lack of informed consent led to outrage among many researchers and users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=LANIER|first1=Jaron|title=Should Facebook Manipulate Users?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/opinion/jaron-lanier-on-lack-of-transparency-in-facebook-study.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many believed that by potentially altering the mood of users by altering what posts they see, Facebook put at-risk individuals at higher dangers for depression and suicide. However, supports of Facebook claim that Facebook details that they have the right to use information for research in their terms of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyd|first1=Danah|title=What does the Facebook experiment teach us?|url=http://socialmediacollective.org/2014/07/01/facebook-experiment/|website=Social Media Collective Research Blog|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say the experiment is just a part of Facebook’s current work, which alters News Feeds algorithms continually to keep people interested and coming back to the site. Others pointed out that this specific study is not along but that news organizations constantly try out different headlines using algorithms to elicit emotions and garner clicks or Facebook shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Duncan|title=Stop complaining about the Facebook study. It's a golden age for research|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/07/facebook-study-science-experiment-research|website=The Guardian|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They say this Facebook study is no different than things people already accept. Still, others say that Facebook broke the law when conducting the experiment on user that didn’t give informed consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grimmelmann|first1=James|title=Illegal, Immoral, and Mood-Altering How Facebook and OkCupid Broke the Law When They Experimented on Users|url=https://medium.com/@JamesGrimmelmann/illegal-unethical-and-mood-altering-8b93af772688|website=Medium|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Facebook study controversy raises numerous questions about informed consent and the differences in the ethical review process between publicly and privately funded research. Some say Facebook was within its limits and others see the need for more informed consent and/or the establishment of in-house private review boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink1=Matthew J. Salganik|last1=Salganik|first1=Matt|title=After the Facebook emotional contagion experiment: A proposal for a positive path forward|url=https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/mjs3/after-the-facebook-emotional-contagion-experiment-a-proposal-for-a-positive-path-forward/|website=Freedom to Tinker|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicts of interest==
Other, long-standing controversies underscore the role for [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] among medical school faculty and researchers. For example, coverage of University of California (UC) medical school faculty members has included news of ongoing corporate payments to researchers and practitioners from companies that market and produce the very devices and treatments they recommend to patients.&lt;ref name="Petersen2014"&gt;Petersen, Melody.

In [[psychology]], '''''jamais vu''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʒ|æ|m|eɪ|_|ˈ|v|uː}}; {{IPA-fr|ʒa.mɛ.vy}}), a [[French language|French]] borrowing meaning "never seen", refers to the [[phenomenon]] of experiencing a situation that one recognizes in some fashion, but nonetheless seems very unfamiliar.

==Overview==
Often described as the opposite of ''[[déjà vu]]'', ''jamais vu'' involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. ''Jamais vu'' is sometimes associated with certain types of [[aphasia]], [[amnesia]], and [[epilepsy]].

''Jamais vu'' is most commonly experienced when a person momentarily does not recognise a word or, less commonly, a person or place, that he or she knows.&lt;ref name="study" /&gt; This can be achieved by anyone by repeatedly writing [[Semantic satiation|or saying a specific word out loud]]. After a few seconds one will often, despite knowing that it is a real word, feel as if "there's no way it is an actual word".

The phenomenon is often grouped with ''[[déjà vu]]'' and [[tip of the tongue|''presque vu'', or ''tip of the tongue'']].

Theoretically, as seen below, a ''jamais vu'' feeling in a sufferer of a [[delirium|delirious]] disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in [[Capgras delusion]], in which the patient takes a person known by him or her for a false [[Look-alike|double]] or impostor. If the impostor is the sufferer himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as [[depersonalisation]]; hence, ''jamais vus'' of oneself, or of the very "reality of reality", are termed [[depersonalization]] and [[derealization]], respectively.

===Experiment===
A study by [[Chris Moulin]] of Leeds University asked 92 volunteers to write out "door" 30 times in 60 seconds. In July 2006 at the 4th International Conference on Memory in Sydney he reported that 68 percent of volunteers showed symptoms of ''jamais vu'', such as beginning to doubt that "door" was a real word. Dr Moulin believes that a similar brain fatigue underlies a phenomenon observed in some schizophrenia patients: that a familiar person has been replaced by an impostor. Dr Moulin suggests they could be suffering from chronic ''jamais vu''.&lt;ref name ="study" /&gt;

==Causes==
''Jamais vu'' can be caused by [[epileptic seizure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epilepsy.com/Epilepsy/seizure_simplepartial "Epilepsy and seizure information for patients and health professionals — Simple Partial Seizures", retrieved 2011-09-08]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related phenomena ==
*''[[Déjà vu]]'': having the strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced, has already been experienced in the past, whether it has actually happened or not. In French, this literally means 'already seen', though in usage it is basically equivalent to ''déjà vécu'', "already lived".
* ''[[Tip of the tongue|Presque vu]]'': almost, but not quite, remembering something. It is also referred to as ''tip of the tongue''.

{{Anti-Semitism}}
{{Discrimination sidebar}}
A '''Jewish quota''' was a [[racial quota]] limiting the number of [[Jew]]s in various establishments to a certain percentage. In particular, in the 19th and 20th centuries, some countries had Jewish quotas in [[higher education]].

Jewish [[educational quotas]] could be statewide law or adopted only in certain institutions, often unofficially. The limitation took the form of total prohibition of Jewish students, or of limiting the number of Jewish students so that their share in the students' population would not be larger than their share in the general population.{{why|date=May 2018}} In some establishments, the Jewish quota placed a limit on growth rather than set a fixed level of participation to be achieved.

Jews who wanted an education used various ways to overcome this discrimination: bribing the authorities, changing their religion, or traveling to countries without such limitations. In Hungary, for example, 5,000 Jewish youngsters (including [[Edward Teller]]) left the country after the introduction of ''[[numerus clausus]]''.

==Countries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students==
* [[Canada]]: Certain universities, notably [[McGill University]], [[Université de Montréal]] and the [[University of Toronto]], had longstanding quotas on the number of Jews admitted to the respective universities. [[McGill University]]'s strict quota was the longest, being officially adopted in 1920 up until the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews: A People's Journey'', (Toronto: University of Toronto Press), 2008, p. 132-133, 319-321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews'', p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Germany]]: On 25 April 1933, the [[Nazi]] government introduced a 1.5 percent quota for new admissions of German Non-[[Aryan race|Aryans]]—i.e. essentially of German Jews—as core issue of a law claiming to generally limit the number of (Aryan and non-Aryan) students admitted to high-schools (''höhere Schulen'') and universities. In addition, high-schools and universities deemed to have more students than required for the professions for which they were training their students were required to reduce their student enrollment; doing so, they had to reach a maximum of 5 per cent of German non-Aryan students. The law was supposedly enacted to avoid overcrowding schools and universities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19330004&amp;zoom=2&amp;seite=00000225&amp;ues=0&amp;x=9&amp;y=13 Gesetz gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen (RGBl 1933 I, S. 225)] (original German text of the ''Law against the Overcrowding of German Schools and Universities'', introduced in 1933)
[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19330004&amp;seite=00000226&amp;zoom=2 Erste Verordnung zur Durchführung des Gesetzes gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen (RGBl 1933 I, S. 226)] (original German text of the ''First Regulation for the Implementation of the Law against the Overcrowding of German Schools and Universities'', introduced in 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; which referred to German concerns at the time that large numbers of students would decrease the quality of higher education. At the beginning of 1933, about 0.76 percent of the German population was Jewish, but more than 3.6 percent of German university students were Jewish, this number having steadily declined from over 9 percent in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/40185665 Claudia Huerkamp (1993). Jüdische Akademikerinnen in Deutschland 1900–1938 (= Jewish academics in Germany 1900–1938). ''Geschichte und Gesellschaft, 19. Jg. (Heft 3),'' Rassenpolitik und Geschlechterpolitik im Nationalsozialismus, pp. 311–331.] Publisher: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht (GmbH &amp; Co. KG)&lt;/ref&gt; After 30 July 1939, Jews were no longer permitted to attend German public schools at all, and the prior quota law was eliminated by a non-public regulation in January 1940.&lt;ref name="Olenhusen"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/30196241 A. G. v. Olenhusen: Die "nichtarischen" Studenten an den deutschen Hochschulen (= The non-Aryan students at German universities). ''Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte, 14(1966),'' pp. 175–206.] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;193&lt;/sup&gt;

: Apart from their strong and predominant anti-Semitic agenda, the law and its subsequent regulations were temporarily indeed used to limit general university access, i.e. including "non-Aryans" (Jews), as the name of the law implied. Starting 1934, a regulation limited the overall numbers of students admitted to German universities, and a special quota was introduced reducing women's admissions to a maximum of 10 percent. Although the limits were not entirely enforced—women's quota stayed a bit above 10 percent mainly because a smaller percentage of men than women accepted their university admissions—they made it for women approximately twice as hard to enter a university career than for men with the same qualification.&lt;ref name="Bildungsbürgerinnen"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QVToe3288bEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%C3%BCberfremdung&amp;f=false Claudia Huerkamp (1996).

(Reihe: ''Bürgertum, Band 10'')] {{ISBN|3-525-35675-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;S.&amp;nbsp;80ff.&lt;/sup&gt; After two semesters, the admission limits were revoked, however, leaving in place the non-Aryan regulations.&lt;ref name="Olenhusen"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;178&lt;/sup&gt;
:''For additional information in German, see the [[:de:Gesetz gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen|article at the German Wikipedia]]''
* [[Hungary]]: a ''Numerus Clausus'' Act was introduced in 1920, under the government of [[Pál Teleki]]. It was said that the ethnic rate of students must meet the ethnic rate of population. Limitations were relaxed in 1928. Racial criteria in admitting new students were removed and replaced by social criteria. Five categories were set up: civil servants, war veterans and army officers, small landowners and artisans, industrialists, and the merchant classes.&lt;ref&gt;See: [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_14969.html Numerus Clausus]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Imperial Russia]] and [[Soviet Union]]: ''Numerus Clausus'' was enacted in 1887, stating that the share of Jewish students should be no more than 10 percent in cities where [[Jew]]s were [[Pale of Settlement|allowed to live]], 5 percent in other cities, and only 3 percent in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. These limitations were removed in the spring of 1917 after the tsar's abdication during the early phase of the Russian revolution of 1917-1918 (the so-called [[February Revolution]] of 1917); later, in the late 1940s during the initial phase of the [[Cold War]] and the tide of the anti-"[[rootless cosmopolitan]]" campaign a [[de facto]] gross discrimination of Jewish applicants was reintroduced in many institutions of higher education in the [[Soviet Union]] until [[Perestroika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[Mikhail Shifman]] |title=You Failed Your Math Test, Comrade Einstein: Adventures and Misadventures of Young Mathematicians Or Test Your Skills in Almost Recreational Mathematics |publisher=World Scientific |date=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ho6fMF8ehogC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Edward Frenkel]] |title=The Fifth problem: math &amp; anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union |date=October 2012 |journal=The New Criterion |url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-Fifth-problem--math---anti-Semitism-in-the-Soviet-Union-7446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-more-migrants-please-especially-the-clever-ones-2368622.html |location=London |work=[[The Independent]] |date=October 11, 2011 |title=More migrants please, especially the clever ones|author=[[Dominic Lawson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Andre Geim]] |title=Biographical |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=2010 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/geim-bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[United States]]: Certain private universities, most notably [[Harvard]], introduced policies which effectively placed a quota on the number of Jews admitted to the university. According to historian [[David Oshinsky]], on writing about [[Jonas Salk]], "Most of the surrounding medical schools ([[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], and [[Yale University|Yale]]) had rigid quotas in place. In 1935 Yale accepted 76 applicants from a pool of 501. About 200 of those applicants were Jewish and only five got in." He notes that Dean Milton Winternitz's instructions were remarkably precise: "Never admit more than five Jews, take only two Italian Catholics, and take no blacks at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerard N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5319">'''Job control''' is a person's ability to [[Social influence|influence]] what happens in his or her work environment, in particular to influence matters that are relevant to his or her personal goals. Job control may include control over work tasks, control over the work pace and physical movement, control over the social and technical environment, and freedom from supervision.

Workplace autonomy has been seen as a specialized form of the more general concept of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ganster|first=Daniel|url=http://www.ilo.org/iloenc/part-v/psychosocial-and-organizational-factors/factors-intrinsic-to-the-job/item/18-autonomy-and-control|title=Autonomy and Control|publisher=ILO|accessdate=2015-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Workplace autonomy''' is the freedom of a person to determine what he or she does at work, and how.

== Association with other factors ==
For [[Georges Friedmann]], the quality of work depends on the employees' [[Skill (labor)|skills]] and on their capacity to control [[decision-making]] at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.llakes.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/31.-Gallie.pdf|last=Gallie|first=Duncan|title=Skills, Job Control and the Quality of Work: The Evidence from Britain, Geary Lecture 2012|journal=The Economic and Social Review|volume=43|issue=3, Autumn|year=2012|pages=325–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Blauner]] found that job control is closely linked with [[occupational prestige]] and [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name="hollowell_2013_p85-86"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hollowell|first=Peter G|title=Lorry Driver Ils 154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfREAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86|date=8 October 2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-25290-7|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dunkerley_2013_p69"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunkerley|first=David|title=The Foreman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SjkNekNgt5cC&amp;pg=PA69|date=2 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-93217-6|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Job satisfaction and job control tend to be higher for [[management|managerial]] and [[professional]] workers than for unskilled workers.&lt;ref name="hollowell_2013_p85-86"/&gt;

A meta-analysis of 1986 found an association of high levels of perceived control with "high levels of job satisfaction […], [[Organizational commitment|commitment]], involvement, [[Job performance|performance]] and [[motivation]], and low levels of physical symptoms, emotional distress, role stress, [[absenteeism]], intent to turnover, and [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spector|first=Paul E.|url=http://hum.sagepub.com/content/39/11/1005.abstract|title=Perceived Control by Employees: A Meta-Analysis of Studies Concerning Autonomy and Participation at Work|journal=Human Relations November|date=1986|volume=39|issue=11|pages=1005–1016|doi=10.1177/001872678603901104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, within the [[job demands-resources model|job demands–resources model]] it is assumed that [[resource]]s such as job control counterbalance job strain and to contribute to motivation. In support of this approach, results of a 2003 study suggest that "as job demands increase, high job control is needed to limit fatigue, whereas either high job control or high job social support is needed to enhance [[intrinsic motivation|intrinsic work motivation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Yperen|first1=Nico W.|last2=Hagedoorn|first2=Mariët|title=Do high job demands increase intrinsic motivation or fatigue or both? The role of job control and social support|journal=Academy of Management Journal|date=2003|volume=46|issue=3|pages=339–348|doi=10.2307/30040627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing job control is an intervention shown to help counteract [[Nervous exhaustion|exhaustion]] and [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] in the workplace, which are two symptoms of [[occupational burnout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hatinen | first1 = M. | last2 = Kinnunen | first2 = U. | last3 = Pekkonen | first3 = M. | last4 = Kalimo | first4 = R. | year = 2007 | title = Comparing two burnout interventions: Perceived job control mediates decreases in burnout | url = | journal = International Journal of Stress Management | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 227–248 | doi=10.1037/1072-5245.14.3.227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Job control has also been linked to the ''meaningfulness'' and the ''manageability'' components of [[salutogenesis]].&lt;ref name="BauerJenny2013-p81"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Georg F. Bauer|author2=Gregor J.

'''Kebony''' is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] wood producer. The company has its roots in Wood Polymer Technologies (WPT), which was founded in 1996 and changed its name to Kebony in 2007. Kebony has a factory in [[Skien, Norway|Skien]] (Norway) and offices in [[Oslo, Norway|Oslo]] (Norway).

==Technology==

Kebony has developed an environmental technology which provides an alternative to threatened and endangered tropical hardwoods, and traditional impregnated wood. In the process, a liquid byproduct of the sugar industry, [[furfuryl alcohol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of the Kebony Technology |url=http://www.martenshout.be/assets/pdf/Kebony_tech-EXT_Jan14.pdf |publisher=martenshout.be |accessdate=11 Jan 2015 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to treat the wood. Using pressure, vacuum and heat treatment, the liquid transforms to [[furan resin]] and is tied together with the cell structure of the wood in order to improve the wood's abilities permanently. The woods used are [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]]-certified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Stewardship Council|url=http://www.fsc.org/|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification|PEFC]]-certified and carry the [[Nordic Ecolabel]] "the Swan".

The technology has been described in multiple articles in media such as CNN,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whiteman|first=Hilary|title=From Norway, an eco-alternative to teak|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/BUSINESS/07/05/kebony.wood.deforestation/index.html|publisher=CNN.com|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kebony CEO Christian Jebsen tells CNN's Jim Boulden about the company's eco-friendly alternative to tropical hardwood. |url=http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/business/2009/07/05/going.green.kebony.wood.cnn.html |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=31 May 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; BBC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Eco-yacht' in Round the Island Race|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-12478847|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Economist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hard act to follow  Environment: Making softwoods more durable could reduce the demand for unsustainably logged tropical hardwoods|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14299540|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Financial Times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Timber, but not as we know it|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/f6e5b004-84ae-11df-9cbb-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1NvUkqggq|accessdate=31 May 2011|newspaper=Financial Times|date=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19994">In [[physics]] and [[applied mathematics]], the mass [[moment of inertia]], usually denoted by {{mvar|I}}, measures the extent to which an object resists rotational acceleration about a particular axis, and is the rotational analogue to mass. Mass moments of inertia have [[physical unit|units]] of [[dimensional analysis|dimension]] ML&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;([mass] × [length]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). It should not be confused with the [[second moment of area]], which is used in beam calculations. The mass moment of inertia is often also known as the rotational inertia, and sometimes as the angular mass.

For simple objects with geometric symmetry, one can often determine the moment of inertia in an exact [[closed-form expression]]. Typically this occurs when the [[mass density]] is constant, but in some cases the density can vary throughout the object as well. In general, it may not be straightforward to symbolically express the moment of inertia of shapes with more complicated mass distributions and lacking symmetry. When calculating moments of inertia, it is useful to remember that it is an additive function and exploit the [[parallel axis theorem|parallel axis]] and [[perpendicular axis theorem]]s.

This article mainly considers symmetric mass distributions, with constant density throughout the object, and the axis of rotation is taken to be through the [[center of mass]] unless otherwise specified.

==Moments of inertia==

Following are scalar moments of inertia. In general, the moment of inertia is a tensor, see below.

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Description || Figure || Moment(s) of inertia
|-
| Point mass ''M'' at a distance ''r'' from the axis of rotation.

A point mass does not have a moment of inertia around its own axis, but using the [[parallel axis theorem]] a moment of inertia around a distant axis of rotation is achieved.

|align="center"|[[File:PointInertia.svg|frameless|upright]]
| &lt;math&gt; I = M r^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Two point masses, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with [[reduced mass]] ''μ'' and separated by a distance ''x'', about an axis passing through the center of mass of the system and perpendicular to the line joining the two particles.
|align="center"|[[File:MOIaboutCOMaxis2.svg|frameless|upright]]
|&lt;math&gt; I = \frac{ m_1 m_2 }{ m_1 \! + \! m_2 } x^2 = \mu x^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| [[Rod (geometry)|Rod]] of length ''L'' and mass ''m'', rotating about its center.

This expression assumes that the rod is an infinitely thin (but rigid) wire. This is a special case of the thin rectangular plate with axis of rotation at the center of the plate, with ''w'' = ''L'' and ''h'' = 0.

| align="center"|[[File:moment of inertia rod center.svg|frameless|upright]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{center} = \frac{1}{12} m L^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="serway"/&gt;
|-
| [[Rod (geometry)|Rod]] of length ''L'' and mass ''m'', rotating about one end.

This expression assumes that the rod is an infinitely thin (but rigid) wire. This is also a special case of the thin rectangular plate with axis of rotation at the end of the plate, with ''h'' = ''L'' and ''w'' = 0.

| align="center"|[[File:moment of inertia rod end.svg|frameless|upright]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{end} = \frac{1}{3} m L^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="serway"/&gt;
|-
| Thin circular loop of radius ''r'' and mass ''m''.

This is a special case of a [[torus]] for ''a'' = 0 (see below), as well as of a thick-walled cylindrical tube with open ends, with ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h'' = 0.

| align="center"|[[File:moment of inertia hoop.svg|170px]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_z = m r^2\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;I_x = I_y = \frac{1}{2} m r^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Thin, solid [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] of radius ''r'' and mass ''m''.

This is a special case of the solid cylinder, with ''h'' = 0. That &lt;math&gt;I_x = I_y = \frac{I_z}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt; is a consequence of the [[perpendicular axis theorem]].

|align="center"| [[File:moment of inertia disc.svg|170px]]
| &lt;math&gt;I_z = \frac{1}{2}m r^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;I_x = I_y = \frac{1}{4} m r^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Thin [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] shell with open ends, of radius ''r'' and mass ''m''.

This expression assumes that the shell thickness is negligible. It is a special case of the thick-walled cylindrical tube for ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
Also, a point mass ''m'' at the end of a rod of length ''r'' has this same moment of inertia and the value ''r'' is called the [[radius of gyration]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- There is no such thing as an illegal set of axes. They may be invalid for some purposes but the x, y and z may just be labels. The right-hand rule has no bearing here.
the x-y-z axis for the solid cylinder does not follow the right-hand rule and is an illegal set of axis. --&gt;
&lt;!--'force at centre of mass always subjects to transational motion. but force at axis ofrotation is not 100% giving rise to transational motion.' - Gibberish! Hopefully, someone can translate this into something meaningful (and get spelling correct).--&gt;

== List of 3D inertia tensors ==

This list of [[Moment of inertia#The inertia tensor|moment of inertia tensor]]s is given for [[Principal axis theorem|principal axes]] of each object.

To obtain the scalar moments of inertia '''I''' above, the tensor moment of inertia '''I''' is projected along some axis defined by a [[unit vector]] '''n''' according to the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{I}\cdot\mathbf{n}\equiv n_i I_{ij} n_j\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the dots indicate [[tensor contraction]] and the [[Einstein summation convention]] is used. In the above table, '''n''' would be the unit [[Cartesian coordinate system#Representing a vector in the standard basis|Cartesian basis]] '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; to obtain ''I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''I&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''I&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15641">Citizens' Declaration ({{lang-ms|Deklarasi Rakyat}}) is a  declaration issued by an array of Malaysian political leaders past and present including former foes stood together on 4 March 2016 to demand Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]]'s resignation from office at a press conference chaired by former Prime Minister Tun Dr [[Mahathir Mohamad]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/malaysia-alliance-demands/2572686.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/mahathir-and-opposition-sign-declaration-to-oust-najib&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/332716&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration also saw Malaysia two biggest political arch-rivals [[Anwar Ibrahim]] and Mahathir Mohamad work together for people's right.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2016/03/04/shahbudin-forgetting-old-wounds-anwar-mahathir-now-working-against-najib/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/04/jailed-anwar-backs-old-foe-mahathir-to-bring-down-malaysian-pm.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Besides demanding that Najib be removed from his position, the declaration signed by, among others, former Premier Mahathir and 57 other signatories also touched on freedom of speech and a free media.
The main points of the declaration were:
*The removal of Najib Razak as the prime minister of Malaysia through non-violent and legally permissible means;
*The removal of all those who have acted in concert with him;
*A repeal of all recent laws and agreements that violate the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, and;
*A restoration of the integrity of the institutions that have been undermined, such as the police, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), Bank Negara and the Public Accounts Committee.

The declaration included several key reasons for the demands:
*Concern over the deteriorating political, economic and social situation in the country;
*Damage done to the country under the premiership of Najib Razak;
* Malaysia becoming one of the 10 most corrupt countries in the world, according to Ernst and Young in their Asia Pacific Fraud Survey Report Series 2013. The 2015 Corruption Perception Index showed Malaysia had dropped four places from 50 to 54; and,
* Allocations to all ministries and public institutions, including universities, have been reduced because of shortage of funds. Even when allocations are budgeted for, no money was available.

CITIZENS' DECLARATION

1.	We - the undersigned citizens of Malaysia append below our concern over the deteriorating political, economic and social situation in the country.

2.	We wish to draw the attention of the people of Malaysia to the damage done to the country under the Premiership of Dato' Sri Najib Tun Razak.

3.	Under his administration the country has descended to become one of the 10 most corrupt countries in the world according to Ernst and Young in their Asia Pacific Fraud Survey Report Series 2013. The 2015 Corruption Perception Index showed Malaysia has dropped four places from 50 to 54.

4.	This is because he believes that money can ensure his position as Prime Minister of Malaysia. He believes that "Cash is King".

5. Allocations to all ministries and public institutions including universities have been reduced because of shortages of funds. Even when allocations are budgeted for, no money was available.

6. In 2009 he decided to set up a Sovereign Wealth fund to earn income for the Government.

7. He created the 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) which became indebted with RM42 billion of loans which it is unable to repay. It is no longer a Sovereign Wealth fund. It is a Sovereign Debt Fund.

8. 1MDB borrowed approximately RM20 billion to acquire three power plant companies for an over-priced RM12.1 billion. Despite being awarded new power plant contracts and extensions to the expiring power-producing concessions, the 1MDB power companies were sold for RM9.83 billion, or a loss of RM2.27 billion.
 
9. 1MDB invested or lent a total of US$1.83 billion to Petrosaudi International (PSI) Limited between 2009 and 2011 under the pretext of bogus projects or non-existent assets.  Bank Negara Malaysia had demanded 1MDB return the above money to Malaysia as their approval was given based on misinformation submitted by 1MDB.  Of this sum, a total of US$1.45 billion was directly and indirectly siphoned off to Good Star Limited and other companies controlled by Low Taek Jho. 
 
10. 	To hide the missing funds, 1MDB "disposed" its investments and loans to PSI for US$2.318 billion, claiming to have made a profit of US$488 million.  However, no money was returned to Malaysia.  Instead, 1MDB claimed it invested the funds in Cayman Islands that was subsequently found to be an unlicensed investment manager.  KPMG was sacked as 1MDB's auditors for refusing to confirm the value of the investment in the mysterious Caymans fund.
 
11.    1MDB claimed that the Cayman Islands investment has been fully redeemed.  US$1.22 billion was reportedly redeemed on 5 November 2014 but was substantially utilised on the very same day to compensate Aabar Investments PJS for the termination of options granted to Aabar to acquire 49% of 1MDB's power companies.  This is a lie because the parent of Aabar, International Petroleum Investment Corporation (IPIC) did not mention receipt of any such payments in its audited accounts published on the London Stock Exchange.  Instead the accounts stated that 1MDB owes IPIC the sum of US$481 million for the termination.
 
12. 1MDB also took another loan of US$975 million from a Deutsche Bank-led consortium in September 2014, for the very same purpose of compensating Aabar for the terminated options.  The Wall Street Journal has exposed the fact that these money have been paid to a different British Virgin Islands entity with a similar name, "Aabar Investment PJS Limited", whose beneficial owner is completely unrelated to IPIC.  The simple scam has fooled even the 1MDB auditors, Deloitte Malaysia into believing that the payments were indeed received by IPIC's Aabar.
 
13. 1MDB announced that it made a 2nd and final RM1.1 billion redemption of the Cayman Islands investment in January 2015.  Initially, the Prime Minister told Parliament that the sum was held in cash in BSI Bank, Singapore.  However, two months later in May 2015, he informed Parliament that it was not cash but "assets".  Subsequently, it was explained that these assets were "units" which meant that they were never redeemed in the first place.  This proved that 1MDB and the Prime Minister have been consistently lying to the Malaysian public.  It also means that the money invested in Petrosaudi which was reinvested in Cayman Islands, are still missing and unaccounted for.

14.	A former UMNO vice-head of the Batu Kawan Division made a police report on the loss of large sums of money by 1MDB. No investigations were carried out by the police. Instead he was interrogated by police, detained and charged under anti-terrorist law (SOSMA) for sabotage of the Malaysian economy. His lawyer was also arrested and charged under the same law. This has the effect of frightening people from making police reports on the 1MDB.

15.	The Wall Street Journal reported that Najib had US$681 million in his private account at Ambank.

16. 	Najib denied this at first but later admitted he had the huge amount of money in his account. He claimed that it was a gift from an Arab; then that it was a donation to help him win the 13th general election in Malaysia; then that it was given because of his dedication to the fight against Islamic terrorists. He then claimed to have received the money from a Saudi prince, then from the King of Saudi Arabia who had passed away.

17.	Later a Saudi Minister stated there was no record of such a gift by the Saudis. He suggested it was probably a Saudi investment. The amount was small.

18.	Najib expressed his intention to sue the Wall Street Journal. But he did not. Instead he asked his lawyer to ask the Wall Street Journal why it published the report.

19.	To this day the WSJ continues to report more and more details about the US$681 million he has in his private account. He has not sued WSJ, which he can do in the country the WSJ is published.

20. Concerned over the huge sum of money in Najib's private account a task force was set up in Malaysia to investigate the origin of the money. Four Government institutions became members of the task force. They are the Police, the Attorney General, Bank Negara and the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission.

21. Before the Task Force was able to finish its work, the Attorney General was removed by Najib claiming that he was sick and could not continue to work. Basically Najib had misrepresented to the King to get the Attorney General to be replaced.  The Public Accounts Committee was basically paralysed by Najib removing its chairman and members to prevent its investigation of the 1MDB. A new chairman, friendly to Najib was appointed and he promptly declared that Najib had done nothing wrong.

22. He then appointed a new Attorney General. Shortly thereafter the new Attorney General dismissed a recommendation by Bank Negara for action to be taken, claiming that nothing in the report showed Najib had done any wrong.

23.	Bank Negara appealed but this was brushed aside.

24.	The new Attorney General also dismissed another report by the MACC. The contents of the report are not revealed and threats are made against revealing its contents.

25. The new Attorney General has without valid explanations, dismissed the recommendations of the two institutions that possess the powers and expertise in their areas.
 
26. This dismissal prevented the matter from being determined by a court of law after all the evidence was evaluated. By doing so the Attorney General has acted as prosecutor and judge. Due process and the rule of law have been denied.

27. The sacked Deputy Prime Minister later revealed that the former Attorney General had shown him proof of Najib's wrongdoings relating to the scandals. At the same time, various foreign Government agencies, namely from Switzerland, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong and Britain have initiated investigations on the 1MDB.

28.	The press in Malaysia is heavily censored so that Malaysians have to rely on the foreign press. Yet when Malaysians discuss or write about the foreign reports, the Government (Inspector General of Police) invited people to make police reports so that the police can carry out questioning and investigation against the person concerned.

29.	This is in contrast to the failure of the police to investigate the police report formally made against Najib, Jho Low and the reports to the Attorney General by Bank Negara and MACC. The Attorney General even threatens to amend the law to provide for jail for life with 10 strokes of the rotan against anyone "leaking" Government papers. This means that crimes committed in the administration can be hidden from the public.

30.	The Attorney General claims that a part of the 2.6 billion Ringgit (about 2.3 billion) has been returned to the donor or donors. Apart from this statement no proof has been provided.

31.	The people are suffering.

32.	Najib's GST and increases in toll rates have increased the cost of living, forcing some businesses to close down and also causing foreign-owned industries to stop operations and relocate to other countries, creating unemployment.

33.	Despite protests by the people Najib joined the US sponsored Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) which erodes our freedom to make policies and laws suitable for our country.

34.	Today Malaysia's image is badly tarnished. Apart from being classified as one of the 10 most corrupt countries, Malaysia is now regarded as undemocratic. There is denial of freedom of speech and freedom of the press and people live in fear of arrest and detentions. Security laws are enacted to allow the Prime Minister (and not the King) to declare security areas where anyone could be arrested and detained without trial and tried under procedures that violate normal and fair criminal justice standards.

35. On the other hand, where errors are made in applying these laws by Government officers, or where there is a blatant abuse of power, the people are unable to hold them accountable. Whistleblowers are harassed and punished instead of being protected. Other repressive laws are used to stifle free speech and legitimate comment about wrongdoings. The fundamental rights enshrined under the Federal Constitution have become meaningless.

36.	For all these reasons, we, the undersigned citizens of Malaysia agree and support:
a) The removal of Dato' Sri Najib Tun Razak as the Prime Minister of Malaysia through non-violent and legally permissible means;
b) The removal of all those who have acted in concert with him;
c) A repeal of all the recent laws and agreements that violate the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution and undermine policy choices and
d) A restoration of the integrity of the institutions that have been undermined, such as the police, the MACC, Bank Negara and the PAC.

37. 	We call upon all Malaysians, irrespective of race, religion, political affiliation, creed or parties, young and old to join us in saving Malaysia from the Government headed by Dato' Sri Najib Tun Razak, to pave the way for much needed democratic and institutional reforms, and to restore the important principle of the separation of powers among the executive, legislature and judiciary which will ensure the independence, credibility, professionalism and integrity of our national institutions.}}

'''Mental rotation''' is the ability to [[rotate]] [[mental image|mental representations]] of [[dimension|two-dimensional]] and [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] objects as it is related to the visual representation of such rotation within the human mind.&lt;ref name="Shepard 701–703"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Roger N.|last2=Metzler|first2=Jacqueline|date=1971-02-19|title=Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/171/3972/701|journal=Science|language=en|volume=171|issue=3972|pages=701–703|doi=10.1126/science.171.3972.701|issn=0036-8075|pmid=5540314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Mental rotation, as a function of visual representation in the human brain, has been associated with the right [[cerebral hemisphere]]. There is a relationship between similar areas of the brain associated with [[perception]] and mental rotation. There could also be a relationship between the cognitive [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of spatial processing, general [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and mental rotation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=A. Michael|date=1990-12-01|title=Speed of Mental Rotation as a Function of Problem-Solving Strategies|url=http://pms.sagepub.com/content/71/3/803|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|language=en|volume=71|issue=3|pages=803–806|doi=10.2466/pms.1990.71.3.803|issn=0031-5125|pmid=2293182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Bill|last2=Anuza|first2=Teresa|date=1982-12-01|title=Effects of Sex, Handedness, Stimulus and Visual Field on "Mental Rotation"|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001094528280049X|journal=Cortex|volume=18|issue=4|pages=501–514|doi=10.1016/S0010-9452(82)80049-X|pmid=7166038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hertzog|first=Christopher|last2=Rypma|first2=Bart|date=2013-11-08|title=Age differences in components of mental-rotation task performance|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03335237|journal=Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=209–212|doi=10.3758/BF03335237|issn=0090-5054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental rotation can be described as the brain moving objects in order to help understand what they are and where they belong. Mental rotation has been studied to try to figure out how the mind recognizes objects in their environment. Researchers generally call such objects [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. Mental rotation is one cognitive function for the person to figure out what the altered object is.

Mental rotation can be separated into the following [[Cognition|cognitive]] stages:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Create a mental image of an object from all directions (imagining where it continues straight vs. turns)
# Rotate the object mentally until a comparison can be made (orientating the stimulus to other figure)
# Make the comparison
# Decide if the objects are the same or not
# Report the decision (reaction time is recorded when level pulled or button pushed)

==Assessment==
In a mental rotation [[Psychological assessment|test]], the participant compares two [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] objects (or [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]]), often rotated in some axis, and states if they are the same [[image]] or if they are [[mirror image]]s ([[Chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphs]]).&lt;ref name="Shepard 701–703"/&gt; Commonly, the test will have pairs of images each rotated a specific number of [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] (e.g. 0°, 60°, 120° or 180°). A set number of pairs will be split between being the same image rotated, while others are mirrored. The researcher judges the participant on how [[Accuracy|accurately]] and [[Rate (mathematics)|rapidly]] they can distinguish between the mirrored and non-mirrored pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What does the Mental Rotation Test Measure?

==Notable research==

=== Shepard and Metzler (1971) ===

[[Roger Shepard]] and Jacqueline Metzler (1971) were some of the first to research the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, R. N., &amp; Metzler, J., "Mental rotation: Effects of Dimensionality of Objects and Type of Task", ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance]]'', Vol 14, Feb 1988, pp. 3-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Their experiment specifically tested mental rotation on three-dimensional objects. Each subject was presented with multiple pairs of three-dimensional, asymmetrical lined or cubed objects. The experiment was designed to measure how long it would take each subject to determine whether the pair of objects were indeed the same object or two different objects. Their [[research]] showed that the [[reaction time]] for participants to decide if the pair of items matched or not was [[Linear#Linear functions|linearly]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[angle]] of rotation from the original position. That is, the more an object has been rotated from the original, the longer it takes an individual to determine if the two images are of the same object or enantiomorphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/1120/ps/ps3/mental-rotation.pdf|journal=Science|year=1971|author1=Shepard, R. N.|author2=Metzler, J.|volume=171|issue=3972|pages=701–703|jstor=1731476|doi=10.1126/science.171.3972.701|pmid=5540314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vandenburg and Kuse (1978) ===
{{main|Mental Rotations Test}}
In 1978, [[Steven G. Vandenberg]] and Allan R. Kuse developed a test to assess mental rotation abilities that was based on Shepard and Metzler's (1971) original study. The [[Mental Rotations Test]] was constructed using India ink drawings. Each stimulus was a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional object drawn by a computer. The image was then displayed on an oscilloscope. Each image was then shown at different orientations rotated around the vertical axis. Following the basic ideas of Shepard and Metzler's experiment, this study found a significant difference in the mental rotation scores between men and women, with men performing better. Correlations with other measures showed strong association with tests of spatial visualization and no association with verbal ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandenberg|first=Steven|date=1978|title=Mental Rotations, a Group Test of Three-Dimensional Spatial Visualization|pmid=724398|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=47|issue=2|pages=599–604|doi=10.2466/pms.1978.47.2.599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Michael|date=2005-03-01|title=Sex differences and the factor of time in solving Vandenberg and Kuse mental rotation problems|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262604002398|journal=Brain and Cognition|volume=57|issue=2|pages=176–184|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2004.08.052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neural activity ==
In 1999, a study was conducted to find out which part of the brain is activated during mental rotation. Seven volunteers (four males and three females) between the ages of twenty-nine to sixty-six participated in this experiment. For the study, the subjects were shown eight characters 4 times each (twice in normal orientation and twice reversed) and the subjects had to decide if the character was in its normal configuration or if it was the mirror image. During this task, a PET scan was performed and revealed activation in the right posterior parietal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Irina M.|last2=Egan|first2=Gary F.|last3=Sonkkila|first3=Cynon|last4=Tochon-Danguy|first4=Henri J.|last5=Paxinos|first5=George|last6=Watson|first6=John D. G.|date=2000-01-01|title=Selective right parietal lobe activation during mental rotation|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/123/1/65|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=123|issue=1|pages=65–73|doi=10.1093/brain/123.1.65|issn=0006-8950|pmid=10611121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]]&amp;nbsp;studies of brain activation during mental rotation reveal consistent increased activation of the parietal lobe, specifically the inter-parietal sulcus, that is dependent on the difficulty of the task. In general, the larger the angle of rotation, the more brain activity associated with the task. This increased brain activation is accompanied by longer times to complete the rotation task and higher error rates. Researchers have argued that the increased brain activation, increased time, and increased error rates indicate that task difficulty is proportional to the angle of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|title=Mental rotation of tactile stimuli|journal= Cognitive Brain Research|volume=14|doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(02)00063-0|pages=91–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gogos|first=Andrea|last2=Gavrilescu|first2=Maria|last3=Davison|first3=Sonia|last4=Searle|first4=Karissa|last5=Adams|first5=Jenny|last6=Rossell|first6=Susan L.|last7=Bell|first7=Robin|last8=Davis|first8=Susan R.|last9=Egan|first9=Gary F.|date=2010-01-01|title=Greater superior than inferior parietal lobule activation with increasing rotation angle during mental rotation: An fMRI study|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393209004163|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=48|issue=2|pages=529–535|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.10.013|pmid=19850055}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Clock rotated depth wise 90 degrees.png|thumb|Rotation in depth 90 degrees]][[File:Clock rotated in the picture plane 90 degrees.png|thumb|Rotation in the picture plane 90 degrees]]

==Color==
Physical objects that people imagine rotating in everyday life have many properties, such as textures, shapes, and colors. A study at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]] was conducted to specifically test the extent to which visual information, such as color, is represented during mental rotation. This study used several methods such as reaction time studies, verbal protocol analysis, and eye tracking. In the initial reaction time experiments, those with poor rotational ability were affected by the colors of the image, whereas those with good rotational ability were not. Overall, those with poor ability were faster and more accurate identifying images that were consistently colored. The verbal protocol analysis showed that the subjects with low [[spatial ability]] mentioned color in their mental rotation tasks more often than participants with high spatial ability. One thing that can be shown through this experiment is that those with higher rotational ability will be less likely to represent color in their mental rotation. Poor rotators will be more likely to represent color in their mental rotation using piecemeal strategies (Khooshabeh &amp; Hegarty, 2008).

==Effect on athleticism and artistic ability==
Research on how athleticism and artistic ability affect mental rotation has also been done. Pietsch, S., &amp; Jansen, P. (2012) showed that people who were athletes or musicians had faster reaction times than people who were not. They tested this by splitting people from the age of 18 and higher into three groups. Group 1 was students who were studying math, sports students and education students. It was found that through the mental rotation test students who were focused on sports did much better than those who were math or education majors. Also it was found that the male athletes in the experiment were faster than females, but male and female musicians showed no significant difference in reaction time.

Moreau, D., Clerc, et al. (2012) also investigated if athletes were more spatially aware than non-athletes. This experiment took undergraduate college students and tested them with the mental rotation test before any sport training, and then again afterward. The participants were trained in two different sports to see if this would help their spatial awareness. It was found that the participants did better on the mental rotation test after they had trained in the sports, than they did before the training. There are ways to train your spatial awareness. This experiment brought to the research that if people could find ways to train their mental rotation skills they could perform better in high context activities with greater ease.

A study investigated the effect of mental rotation on postural stability. Participants performed a MR (mental rotation) task involving either foot stimuli, hand stimuli, or non-body stimuli (a car) and then had to balance on one foot. The results suggested that MR tasks involving foot stimuli were more effective at improving balance than hand or car stimuli, even after 60 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=a3da1b76-fd74-4640-abfb-c61d3a4ecdeb%2540sessionmgr4010&amp;hid=4107&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%253d%253d#AN=2016-29576-008&amp;db=psyh|title=Improvement of postural stability during quiet standing obtained after mental rotation of foot stimuli.|last=Kawasaki|first=Tsubasa|date=2017-07-11|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers studied the difference in mental rotation ability between gymnasts, handball, and soccer players with both in-depth and in-plane rotations. Results suggested that athletes were better at performing mental rotation tasks that were more closely related to their sport of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Effects of the axis of rotation and primordially solicited limb of high level athletes in a mental rotation task.|journal=Human Movement Science|volume=37|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hamdi_Habacha/publication/264241628_Effects_of_the_axis_of_rotation_and_primordially_solicited_limb_of_high_level_athletes_in_a_mental_rotation_task/links/5a107ee0a6fdccc2d79997bf/Effects-of-the-axis-of-rotation-and-primordially-solicited-limb-of-high-level-athletes-in-a-mental-rotation-task.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a correlation in mental rotation and motor ability in children, and this connection is especially strong in boys age 7–8. Children were known for having very connected motor and cognitive processes, and the study showed that this overlap is influenced by motor ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The role of rotational hand movements and general motor ability in children’s mental rotation performance.|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=6|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mental rotation test (MRT) was carried out on gymnasts, orienteers, runners, and non athletes. Results showed that non athletes were greatly outperformed by gymnasts and orienteers, but not runners. Gymnasts (egocentric athletes) did not outperform orienteers (allocentric athletes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gymnasts and orienteers display better mental rotation performance than nonathletes.|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|volume=37|doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender ==
Different studies have shown that there is a difference between male and female in mental rotation tasks.

In order to explain this difference, we can look at the brain activation during a mental rotation task. In 2012, a study&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; have been done on people that graduated in sciences or in liberal arts. Males and females were asked to execute a mental rotation task, and their brain activity was recorded with an fMRI. The researchers found a difference of brain activation: males present a stronger activity in the area of the brain used in a mental rotation task.

A study from 2008 showed that this difference occurs early during development. The experiment was done on 3- to 4-month-old infants using a 2D mental rotation task. They used a preference apparatus that consists of observing during how much time the infant is looking at the stimulus. They started by familiarizing the participants with the number "1" and its rotations. Then they showed them a picture of a "1" rotated and its mirror image. The study showed that males are more interested by the mirror image. Females are equally interested by the "1" rotated and its mirror image. According to the study, this may mean that males and females, at least when infants, process mental rotation differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quinn|first=Paul C.|last2=Liben|first2=Lynn S.|date=2008-11-01|title=A Sex Difference in Mental Rotation in Young Infants|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/19/11/1067|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=19|issue=11|pages=1067–1070|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02201.x|issn=0956-7976|pmid=19076474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study from 2015 was focused on women and their abilities in a mental rotation task and in an emotion recognition task. In this experiment, they induced a feeling or a situation in which women feel more powerful or less powerful. They were able to conclude that women in a situation of power are better in a mental rotation task (but less performant in an emotion recognition task) than other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissan|first=Tali|last2=Shapira|first2=Oren|last3=Liberman|first3=Nira|date=2015-10-01|title=Effects of Power on Mental Rotation and Emotion Recognition in Women|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/41/10/1425|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=41|issue=10|pages=1425–1437|doi=10.1177/0146167215598748|issn=0146-1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studying differences between male and female brains can have interesting applications. For example, it could help in the understanding of the [[autism spectrum disorders]].

One of the theories concerning autism is the EMB ([[extreme male brain]]). This theory considers that autist have an "extreme male brain". In a study&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zapf|first=Alexandra C.|last2=Glindemann|first2=Liv A.|last3=Vogeley|first3=Kai|last4=Falter|first4=Christine M.|date=2015-04-17|title=Sex Differences in Mental Rotation and How They Add to the Understanding of Autism|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124628|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=4|pages=e0124628|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0124628|issn=1932-6203|pmid=25884501|pmc=4401579}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2015, researchers confirmed that there is a difference between male and female in mental rotation task (by studying people without autism): Males are more successful. Then they highlighted the fact that autists do not have this "male performance" in a mental rotation task. They conclude their study by "autistic people do not have an extreme version of a male cognitive profile as proposed by the EMB theory".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Current research directions==
{{Further information|Abstraction}}
There may be relationships between competent bodily movement and the speed with which individuals can perform mental rotation. Researchers found children who trained with mental rotation tasks had improved strategy skills after practicing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meneghetti|first=Chiara|last2=Cardillo|first2=Ramona|last3=Mammarella|first3=Irene C.|last4=Caviola|first4=Sara|last5=Borella|first5=Erika|date=2016-02-10|title=The role of practice and strategy in mental rotation training: transfer and maintenance effects|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-016-0749-2|journal=Psychological Research|language=en|pages=1–17|doi=10.1007/s00426-016-0749-2|issn=0340-0727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Follow-ups studies will compare the differences in the brain among the attempts to discover effects on other tasks and the brain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3663">'''Meta-systems''' have several definitions. In general, they link the concepts "[[system]]" and "[[meta-]]". A "meta-system" is about other systems, such as describing, generalizing, modelling, or analyzing the other system(s).

According to [[Valentin Turchin|Turchin]] and [[Cliff Joslyn|Joslyn]] (1997), this "natural" systemic definition is not sufficient for their Theory of Meta-system Transition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MST.html Metasystem Transition Theory], [[Valentin Turchin]], [[Cliff Joslyn]], 1993-1997&lt;/ref&gt; it also is not equivalent to the definition of ''[[system of systems]]'' in [[Autopoiesis|Autopoietic System]]s Theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archonic.net Reflexive Autopoietic Systems Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In economics ==
In [[economics]], meta-systems are like what [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]] calls general economies as opposed to the restricted economies of systems.

A book about the difference between general and restricted economies is ''Complementarity'' by [[Arshad Naim]]. In this case "meta" is defined as what is beyond: the meta-system is what lies beyond the system.

==In mathematics, biology and psychology==

In [[mathematics]], [[biology]] and [[psychology]], many variables have occurred within [[structure]]s and systems that [[determined]] the results, discoveries, [[Rate (mathematics)|rates]] and [[Value (mathematics)|value]](s) of [[set (mathematics)|sets]], systems, and developments within systems, structures, systems within structures and sets of structures.

A [[mathematical]]-modelling rule system for a [[Scientific modelling|domain]] D is an example of a meta-system in mathematics and [[science]], for similar and [[consistency]] of concrete or [[frequency]] found in [[computer models|models]] within a domain. 
These are all modes or models; where commonalities are more consistent with consecutive scores or values within a [[range (statistics)|ranged order]] and are good indicators for gauging [[probability|probabilities]], traits (psychology) or properties (biology).

== In cultural studies and sociology ==
Meta-systems in [[cultural studies]] and [[sociology]] refer to contexts, milieux, situations, [[ecosystem]]s, [[natural environment|environments]] and the [[biological process]] with the use of commonalities in behavioral [[Trait theory|trait]]s and human developments found surrounding a [[social]] or [[scientific]] system which the system must interact with in order to remain viable. Meta-systems have different structures and also are complementary to other structures of such systems. Without this complementarity in the [[values]], [[Human bonding|bonding]]s, or [[tact (psychology)|tact]], the systems could not remain productive, viable or operational.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

== In cybernetics==
The term "meta-system" (or "metasystem") in [[cybernetics]] is synonymous with [[management]] [[system]] or [[control system]]. [[Stafford Beer]], who founded [[management cybernetics]] with his [[viable system model]], speaks of metasystems that apply metalanguages which are able to find means of making decisions when necessary improvements cannot be made. In [[computer science]] this is known as the [[halting problem]]. Here metalanguage works in a larger context than the language it describes and has more [[variety (cybernetics)|variety]].

{{Jainism}}
'''Nirjara''' is one of the seven fundamental principles, or [[Tattva (Jainism)|Tattva]] in [[Jain philosophy]], and refers to the shedding or removal of accumulated [[Karma in Jainism|karma]]s from the [[Atman (Jainism)|atma]] (soul), essential for breaking free from [[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]], the cycle of birth-death and [[Reincarnation|rebirth]], by achieving [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]], liberation.&lt;ref name=si&gt;[[#Si|Singh, p. 4525]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Da|Dasgupta, 192]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Literally meaning "falling off", the concept is described first in chapter 9 of the classical Jain text, [[Tattvartha Sutra]] (True nature of Reality) written by  Acharya [[Umasvati]], in 2nd century CE, the only text authoritative in both [[Svetambara]] and [[Digambara]] sects of Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ji|Jaini, p. 82]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later it also finds mention in [[Dravyasamgraha]]  (Compendium of substances), a 10th-century Jain text by Acharya [[Nemichandra]].&lt;ref name=sd&gt;[[#Sd|Nemichandra, p. 93]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Nirjara is preceded by stoppage of karma accumulation, or ''[[samvara]]'', thereby ending ''[[asrava]]'' or influx of karma which leads to ''[[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]]'' or bondage due ''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|kasaya]]'' or passions of the soul, namely, ''krodha'' (anger), ''lobha'' (greed), ''mana'' (ego) and ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' (deceit), besides ''[[raaga]]'' (attachment) and ''dvesa'' (hatred). '' [[Dravyasamgraha]]'' explains that the soul becomes dim due to the dust of karmic matter,  thus nirjara itself offers a way to clear the soul, and ultimately leading to [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]], liberation.&lt;ref name=st/&gt;

==Types of Nirjara==
Nirjara is of two types, ''Bhava Nirjara'', modification of soul which leads to separation of karmic matter from the soul, and ''Dravya Nirjara'', actual separation of karmic matter from the soul. In turn, ''bhava nirjara'' is of two types, ''Savipaka'' and ''Avipaka''.&lt;ref name=st&gt;[[#Sd|Nemichandra, p. 94]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Savipaka Nirjara''===
'''Savipaka''' - Passive Method - Also known as ''Akam'' or [[wikt:unintentional|unintentional]] ''Nirjara'', [[wikt:equanimous|equanimous]] submission to the fruition of karma, and involves natural maturing of past Karma, in due course of time and experiencing the results, both good and bad with equanimity. If the fruits of the past karmas are not received without attachment or agitation then the soul earns fresh karmic bondages.  It is also not possible for the soul to know before-hand when and which karma will start to produce results and therefore require good discipline in practicing equanimity under all circumstances.

This passive method of exhaustion of karmic matter around the soul, after enjoyment of its fruits, is compared with emptying of a pond through evaporation, while water channels are still pouring in. Naturally it is a slow method, as by the time karmas become ripe and are exhausted, new karmas fill in, as karmic matter is constantly pouring into the ''karma sharira'' (karmic body), through [[asrava]], influx of karma. Thus to achieve liberation, the active method of purging off karma, ''avipaka nirjara'' is advised.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;&lt;ref name=ja&gt;[[#Ja|Jainism. p. 50]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Avipaka Nirjara''===
'''Avipaka''' - Active Method - Also known as ''Sakam'' or intentional ''Nirjara'', it involves individual exertion of [[ascetic]] practices, by practicing internal and external austerities, like penances or [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]], literally meaning heat, so as to accelerate the ripening process as well as reducing the effects produced.  This is recommended approach as it prepares and conditions the soul and reminds it to be vigilant. Tapas is of two kinds, ''bahya'' or external, and ''antaranga'' or internal.&lt;ref name=si/&gt;&lt;ref name=ja/&gt;

====''Bahya tapas''====
The ''Bahya'' or ''bahiranga tapa'', external austerities are meant to discipline the sensual cravings, and prepares the person for internal austerities, which come next.

# ''Anasana'' - Fasting, purifies sense organs, lessens sens of attachment to bodily enjoyments
# ''Avamodarya'' or ''Alpahara'' - Eating less than one's normal diet, removed laziness/lethargy and brings in fresh energy to the mind
# ''Vritti parisankhyana'' or ''Vrita sankshepa'' - Restriction of certain kinds or number of food
# ''Rasa parityaga'' -Daily renunciation of one or more of 6 kinds of ''Rasas'' delicacies: [[ghee]] (butter, clarified butter), milk, curd, sugar, salt, oil. Abstention from tasty and stimulating food

At some places, alternative to this list include, ''Ichhanirodha'', control of desire for food and material things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/9tatvas.txt Nine Tattvas: 8. Nirjara]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Antaraga tapas''====
The ''antaranga tapa'', internal austerities which follow are:

# ''Prayaschita'' - [[wikt:Atonement|Atonement]]/penance for sinful acts
# ''Vinaya'' - Practice politeness and humility
# ''Vaiyavritya'' - Service to others, especially monks, nuns, elders and the weaker souls without any expectations in return
# ''Swadhyaya'' - Self-study, scriptural study, questioning and expanding the spiritual knowledge
# ''Vyutsarga'' - Abandonment of passions - especially anger, ego, deceit and greed, distinction between body and soul
# ''Dhyana'' - Meditation and contemplation

All the first five internal austerities and all six external austerities are preparatory steps for the practice of [[wikt:dhyana|dhyana]], which is the primary cause of moksha.&lt;ref name=st/&gt;

For layman the journey begins with practicing the [[Triple gems of Jainism]], ''[[Ratnatraya]]'', namely [[Triple_gems_of_Jainism#Right_View|Right View]] or perception (''Samyak Darshana''), [[Triple_gems_of_Jainism#Right_knowledge|Right knowledge]] (''Samyak Gyana'') and [[Triple_gems_of_Jainism#Right_conduct|Right conduct]] (''Samyak Charitra''), which constitute the path to liberation. The [[Jain monasticism|monks in Jainism]], who have dedicated their lives to achieve, moksha and acquiring the ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'', absolute knowledge, however go on to take the five ''[[Mahavrata]]'', literally Great Vows, of self-control:
# [[Non-violence]] ([[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]])
# Truth ([[Satya]])
# Non-stealing ([[Asteya]])
# Chastity ([[Brahmacharya]])
# Non-possession/[[Detachment (philosophy)|Non-attachment]] ([[Aparigraha]]) .&lt;ref name=st&gt;[[#Si|Singh, p. 4526]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from that, the monks also practices, three ''Guptis'' and five ''Samitis''. Three Restraints (''Gupti''), i.e., Control of the mind (Managupti), Control of speech (Vacanagupti), Control of body (Kayagupti); and Five Carefulness (Samiti) i.e. Carefulness while walking (Irya Samiti), Carefulness while communicating (Bhasha Samiti), Carefulness while eating (Eshana Samiti), Carefulness while handling their fly-whisks, water gourds, etc. (Adana Nikshepana Samiti), Carefulness while disposing of bodily waste matter (Pratishthapana Samiti)

According to [[Umaswati]] in ''[[Tattvartha Sutra]]'' 10.1.2, ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'', absolute knowledge or [[Omniscience]], comes only after, the [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Mohaniya_karman|Mohaniya karma]] are first destroyed, followed by [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Jnanavaraniya_karma|Jnanavaraniya karma]], [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Darsanavarana_karma|Darsanavarana karma]] and [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Antaraya_karma|Antaraya karma]]. However after attaining the ''Kevala jnana'', the causes of [[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]], bondage end, thus the influx of Karma, [[asrava]], ends as well, thus the person is freed from the [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Aghatiya_karmas|Aghatiya karmas]] namely, [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Ayu_Karma|Ayu karma]], [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Nama_Karma|Nama karma]], [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Gotra_Karma|Gotra karma]] and [[Types_of_Karma_(Jainism)#Vedaniya_Karma|Vedaniya karma]], which cause worldly existence. Emptied of karma the person attains liberation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sd|Nemichandra, p. 97]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The method substitutes boundary conditions at the interface by a partial differential equation for the evolution of an auxiliary field (the phase field) that takes the role of an [[order parameter]]. This phase field takes two distinct values (for instance +1 and &amp;minus;1) in each of the phases, with a smooth change between both values in the zone around the interface, which is then diffuse with a finite width. A discrete location of the interface may be defined as the collection of all points where the phase field takes a certain value (e.g., 0). 

A phase field model is usually constructed in such a way that in the limit of an infinitesimal interface width (the so-called sharp interface limit) the correct interfacial dynamics are recovered. This approach permits to solve the problem by integrating a set of partial differential equations for the whole system, thus avoiding the explicit treatment of the boundary conditions at the interface.

Phase field models were first introduced by Fix&lt;ref&gt;G.J. Fix, in Free Boundary Problems: Theory and Applications, Ed. A. Fasano and M. Primicerio, p. 580, Pitman (Boston, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; and Langer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| doi=10.1142/9789814415309_0005|chapter=Models of Pattern Formation in First-Order Phase Transitions|title=Directions in Condensed Matter Physics|journal=Directions in Condensed Matter Physics.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have experienced a growing interest in solidification and other areas.

==Equations of the Phase field model==

Phase field models are usually constructed in order to reproduce a given interfacial dynamics. For instance, in solidification problems the front dynamics is given by a diffusion equation for either concentration or temperature in the bulk and some boundary conditions at the interface (a local equilibrium condition and a conservation law),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.52.1|title=Instabilities and pattern formation in crystal growth|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=52|pages=1|year=1980|last1=Langer|first1=J. S.|bibcode=1980RvMP...52....1L}}&lt;/ref&gt; which constitutes the sharp interface model.
[[image:Phase field order parameter.jpg|280px|right|thumb|A two phase microstructure and the order parameter &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; profile is shown on a line across the domain. Gradual change of order parameter from one phase to another shows diffuse nature of the interface.]]

A number of formulations of the phase field model are based on a [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] function depending on an order parameter (the phase field) and a diffusive field (variational formulations). Equations of the model are then obtained by using general relations of [[statistical physics]]. Such a function is constructed from physical considerations, but contains a parameter or combination of parameters related to the interface width. Parameters of the model are then chosen by studying the limit of the model with this width going to zero, in such a way  that one can identify this limit with the intended sharp interface model.

Other formulations start by writing directly the phase field equations, without referring to any thermodynamical functional (non-variational formulations). In this case the only reference is the sharp interface model, in the sense that it should be recovered when performing the small interface width limit of the phase field model.

Phase field equations in principle reproduce the interfacial dynamics when the interface width is small compared with the smallest length scale in the problem. In solidification this scale is the capillary length &lt;math&gt;d_o&lt;/math&gt;, which is a microscopic scale. From a computational point of view integration of partial differential equations resolving such a small scale is prohibitive. However, Karma and Rappel introduced the thin interface limit,&lt;ref name=thin&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.57.4323|title=Quantitative phase-field modeling of dendritic growth in two and three dimensions|journal=Physical Review E|volume=57|issue=4|pages=4323|year=1998|last1=Karma|first1=Alain|last2=Rappel|first2=Wouter-Jan|bibcode=1998PhRvE..57.4323K}}&lt;/ref&gt; which permitted to relax this condition and has opened the way to practical quantitative simulations with phase field models.
With the increasing power of computers and the theoretical progress in phase field modelling, phase field models have become a useful tool for the numerical simulation of interfacial problems.

===Variational formulations===

A model for a phase field can be constructed by physical arguments if one has an explicit expression for the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the system. A simple example for solidification problems is the following:

&lt;math&gt;F[e,\phi]=\int d{\mathbf r} \left[ K|{\mathbf
\nabla}\phi|^2 + h_0f(\phi) + e_0u(\phi)^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is the phase field, &lt;math&gt;u(\phi)=e/e_0 + h(\phi)/2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the local enthalpy per unit volume, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is a certain polynomial function of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e_0={L^2}/{T_{M}c_{p}}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[latent heat]], &lt;math&gt;T_M&lt;/math&gt; is the melting temperature, and &lt;math&gt;c_{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat). The term with &lt;math&gt;\nabla\phi&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the interfacial energy. The function &lt;math&gt;f(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; is usually taken as a double-well potential describing the free energy density of the bulk of each phase, which themselves correspond to the two minima of the function &lt;math&gt;f(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;. The constants &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_{0}&lt;/math&gt; have respectively dimensions of energy per unit length and energy per unit volume. The interface width is then given by &lt;math&gt;W=\sqrt{K/h_0}&lt;/math&gt;.  
The phase field model can then be obtained from the following variational relations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.49.435|title=Theory of dynamic critical phenomena|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=49|issue=3|pages=435|year=1977|last1=Hohenberg|first1=P.|last2=Halperin|first2=B.|bibcode=1977RvMP...49..435H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\partial_{t} \phi = -\frac{1}{\tau}
\left(\frac{\delta F}{\delta \phi} \right) + {\eta}({\mathbf
r},t)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\partial_{t} e =
De_0\nabla^2 \left( \frac{\delta F}{\delta e} \right) -
{\mathbf{\nabla}} \cdot{\mathbf {q}}_e({\mathbf r},t).
&lt;/math&gt;

where D is a diffusion coefficient for the variable &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {q}_e&lt;/math&gt; are stochastic terms accounting for thermal fluctuations (and whose statistical properties can be obtained from the [[fluctuation dissipation theorem]]). The first equation gives an equation for the evolution of the phase field, whereas the second one is a diffusion equation, which usually is rewritten for the temperature or for the concentration (in the case of an alloy). These equations are, scaling space with &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and times with &lt;math&gt;l^2/D&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
\alpha \varepsilon^2\partial_{t} \phi =
\varepsilon^2\nabla^2\phi- f'(\phi) - \frac{e_0}{h_0}
h'(\phi)u+\tilde \eta({\mathbf r},t)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\partial_{t}u = \nabla^{2}u+\frac{1}{2}h'(\phi) \partial_{t} \phi -
{\mathbf \nabla}\cdot {\mathbf q_{u}}({\mathbf r},t) 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=W/l&lt;/math&gt; is the nondimensional interface width, &lt;math&gt;\alpha={D\tau}/{W^2h_0}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tilde\eta({\mathbf r},t)&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf q_{u}}({\mathbf r},t)&lt;/math&gt; are nondimensionalized noises.

===Alternative Energy Density Functions===

The choice of free energy function, &lt;math&gt;f(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, can have a significant effect on the physical behaviour of the interface, and should be selected with care.  The double-well function represents an approximation of the Van der Waals EOS near the critical point, and has historically been used for its simplicity of implementation when the phase field model is employed solely for interface tracking purposes.  However, this has led to the frequently observed spontaneous drop shrinkage phenomenon, whereby the high phase miscibility predicted by an Equation of State near the critical point allows significant interpenetration of the phases and can eventually lead to the complete disappearance of a droplet whose radius is below some critical value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jcp.2006.11.020|title=Spontaneous shrinkage of drops and mass conservation in phase-field simulations|journal=Journal of Computational Physics|volume=223|pages=1|year=2007|last1=Yue|first1=Pengtao|last2=Zhou|first2=Chunfeng|last3=Feng|first3=James J.|bibcode=2007JCoPh.223....1Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Minimizing perceived continuity losses over the duration of a simulation requires limits on the Mobility parameter, resulting in a delicate balance between interfacial smearing due to convection, interfacial reconstruction due to free energy minimization (i.e. mobility-based diffusion), and phase interpenetration, also dependent on the mobility.   A recent review of alternative energy density functions for interface tracking applications has proposed a modified form of the double-obstacle function which avoids the spontaneous drop shrinkage phenomena and limits on mobility,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijmultiphaseflow.2011.02.002|title=Diffuse interface tracking of immiscible fluids: Improving phase continuity through free energy density selection|journal=International Journal of Multiphase Flow|volume=37|issue=7|pages=777|year=2011|last1=Donaldson|first1=A.A.|last2=Kirpalani|first2=D.M.|last3=MacChi|first3=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with comparative results provide for a number of benchmark simulations using the double-well function and the VOF sharp interface technique.  The proposed implementation has a computational complexity only slightly greater than that of the double-well function, and may prove useful for interface tracking applications of the phase field model where the duration/nature of the simulated phenomena introduces phase continuity concerns (i.e. small droplets, extended simulations, multiple interfaces, etc.).

===Sharp interface limit of the Phase field equations===

A phase field model can be constructed to purposely reproduce a given interfacial dynamics as represented by a sharp interface model. In such a case the sharp interface limit (i.e. the limit when the interface width goes to zero) of the proposed set of phase field equations should be performed. This limit is usually taken by asymptotic expansions of the fields of the model in powers of the interface width &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. These expansions are performed both in the interfacial region (inner expansion) and in the bulk (outer expansion), and then are asymptotically matched order by order. The result gives a partial differential equation for the diffusive field and a series of boundary conditions at the interface, which should correspond to the sharp interface model and whose comparison with it provides the values of the parameters of the phase field model.

Whereas such expansions were in early phase field models performed up to the lower order in &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; only, more recent models use higher order asymptotics (thin interface limits) in order to cancel undesired spureous effects or to include new physics in the model. For example, this technique has permitted to cancel kinetic effects,&lt;ref name=thin/&gt; to treat cases with unequal diffusivities in the phases,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0167-2789(00)00064-6|title=Thin interface asymptotics for an energy/entropy approach to phase-field models with unequal conductivities|journal=Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena|volume=144|pages=154|year=2000|last1=McFadden|first1=G.B.|last2=Wheeler|first2=A.A.|last3=Anderson|first3=D.M.|bibcode=2000PhyD..144..154M}}&lt;/ref&gt; to model viscous fingering&lt;ref name="viscous" /&gt; and two-phase Navier–Stokes flows,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1006/jcph.1999.6332|title=Calculation of Two-Phase Navier–Stokes Flows Using Phase-Field Modeling|journal=Journal of Computational Physics|volume=155|pages=96|year=1999|last1=Jacqmin|first1=David|bibcode=1999JCoPh.155...96J}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include fluctuations in the model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.71.061603 |title=Sharp-interface projection of a fluctuating phase-field model |journal=Physical Review E |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=061603 |year=2005 |last1=Benítez |first1=R. |last2=Ramírez-Piscina |first2=L. |bibcode=2005PhRvE..71f1603B |arxiv=cond-mat/0409707 }}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

== Multi Phase Field Models==
[[image:Multi Phase Field Order Parameters.jpg|280px|right|thumb|Multiple order parameters describe a polycrystalline material microstructure.]]
In multi-phase field models, microstructure is described by set of order parameters, each of which is related to a specific phase or crystallographic orientation. This model is mostly used for solid state phase transformations where multiple grains evolve (e.g.  [[grain growth]], [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]] or first order transformation like [[austenite]] to [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] in ferrous alloys). Besides allowing the description of multiple grains in a microstructure, multi-phase field models especially allow for consideration of multiple thermodynamic phases occurring e.g. in technical alloy grades.&lt;ref name=technical&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phase-field based simulation of microstructure evolution in technical alloy grades|journal=International Journal of Advances in Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics|volume=2|issue=4|pages=126|year=2011|doi=10.1007/s12572-011-0026-y|last1=Schmitz|first1=G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="918">In [[Julian Barbour]]'s book ''[[The End of Time: The Next Revolution in Our Understanding of the Universe]]'', '''Platonia''' is the name given to his hypothetic entity of a [[time]]less realm containing every possible "Now" or momentary configuration of the universe.

The term can also be applied more generally to the "world of Forms" or "Plato's heaven" in [[Platonism|Platonic]] [[metaphysics]], and to the "[[ultimate ensemble]]" in [[Max Tegmark]]'s variation of [[multiverse]] theory.

'''Pollutant-induced abnormal behaviour''' refers to the [[abnormal behaviour]] induced by [[pollutant]]s. Chemicals released into the natural environment by humans impact the behaviour of a wide variety of animals. The main culprits are [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine-disrupting chemicals]] (EDCs), which mimic, block, or interfere with animal hormones. A new research field, integrative behavioural ecotoxicology, is emerging.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Elizabeth K.|last2=Buchwalter|first2=David B.|last3=Kerby|first3=Jacob L.|last4=LeFauve|first4=Matthew K.|last5=Varian-Ramos|first5=Claire W.|last6=Swaddle|first6=John P.|date=2017-04-01|title=Integrative behavioral ecotoxicology: bringing together fields to establish new insight to behavioral ecology, toxicology, and conservation|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/cz/zox010|journal=Current Zoology|language=en|volume=63|issue=2|pages=185–194|doi=10.1093/cz/zox010|issn=1674-5507}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, chemical pollutants are not the only anthropogenic offenders. Noise and light pollution also induce abnormal behaviour. 

This topic is of special concern for its conservation and human health implications and has been studied greatly by animal behaviourists, environmental toxicologists, and conservation scientists. Behaviours serve as potential indicators for ecological health. Behaviour can be more sensitive to EDCs than developmental and physiological traits, and it was the behaviour of eagles that first drew attention to the now well-known dangers of DDT.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zala|first=Sarah M.|last2=Penn|first2=Dustin J.|date=2004|title=Abnormal behaviours induced by chemical pollution: a review of the evidence and new challenges|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347204001782|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=68|issue=4|pages=649–664|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.01.005|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, behaviour is generally difficult to measure and can be highly variable.

Behaviours which are critical for survival, such as reproductive and social behaviours, and cognitive abilities like learning can be affected directly or indirectly by chemical pollutants— many examples have been documented, and their chemical culprits have been identified. These same behaviours can also be altered by anthropogenic noise and light, although their mechanisms are relatively unknown.

== EDCs known to alter behaviour&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==
* [[Atrazine]] (pesticide)
* [[Bisphenol A]]
* [[Carbaryl]]
* [[Cypermethrin]]
* [[DDT]]
* [[Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate|DEHP]]
* [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|Dioxin]]
* [[Endosulfan]]
* [[Fenarimol]]
* [[Fenitrothion]]
* [[Kepone]]
* [[Lead]]
* [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]
* [[Methoxychlor]]
* [[Nonylphenol]]
* [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]
* [[Vinclozolin]]
* [[Trenbolone|17β-trenbolone]] (agricultural pollutant)

Determining the link between such pollutants and altered behaviours often requires both field studies and laboratory studies. Field studies are useful in determining whether behavioural changes appear with pollution levels occurring in the environment, while laboratory studies can be used to clarify the mechanisms connecting an environmental pollutant to specific behavioural changes.

== Mechanisms&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==
EDCs affect the synthesis, storage, release, transport, clearance, receptor recognition, binding, or post-receptor responses of hormones. This results in either stimulative or inhibitive effects, resulting in overproduction or underproduction of hormones. The effects of hormones on behaviour have been well studied, and often produce direct behavioural effects by acting on the central nervous system. Indirectly, behaviours may be altered by hormones influencing an animal's metabolism or other important processes.

Since behaviours also influence hormones, chemical pollutants that induce behavioural changes may also affect hormone levels, which could result in more behavioural or other changes.

== Applying Tinbergen’s four questions&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ==

Studies into the mechanisms underlying behavioural adjustments fall into a category of animal behaviour research described by Tinbergen.

Studies of animal behaviour typically pertain to one of [[Tinbergen's four questions|Tinbergen’s four questions]], and these can be applied to studies regarding chemical pollution. Questions of causation focus on how pollutant-exposure disrupts the mechanisms behind normal behaviour. For example, when differences in sexual behaviours were noted in wildlife after the introduction of DDT, biochemical experiments on rats were able to show that the pollutant was inhibiting androgen binding to androgen receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=Graham R|last2=Sloman|first2=Katherine A|date=2004|title=The effects of environmental pollutants on complex fish behaviour: integrating behavioural and physiological indicators of toxicity|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166445X0400102X|journal=Aquatic Toxicology|volume=68|issue=4|pages=369–392|doi=10.1016/j.aquatox.2004.03.016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Secondly, questions of ontogeny consider how exposure disrupts the development of behaviours. An example is when researchers examined the effects of an aerosol on the spatial learning of mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Win-Shwe|first=Tin-Tin|last2=Kyi-Tha-Thu|first2=Chaw|last3=Moe|first3=Yadanar|last4=Maekawa|first4=Fumihiko|last5=Yanagisawa|first5=Rie|last6=Furuyama|first6=Akiko|last7=Tsukahara|first7=Shinji|last8=Fujitani|first8=Yuji|last9=Hirano|first9=Seishiro|date=2015-06-30|title=Nano-Sized Secondary Organic Aerosol of Diesel Engine Exhaust Origin Impairs Olfactory-Based Spatial Learning Performance in Preweaning Mice|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/5/3/1147|journal=Nanomaterials|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=1147–1162|doi=10.3390/nano5031147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, questions of adaptation consider how behavioural modifications resulting from exposure will influence fitness. Scientists have investigated the reproductive success of white ibises exposed to Methylmercury, for instance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Lastly, questions of phylogeny consider how phylogenetic history might predetermine sensitivity or resistance to pollutants in a particular behaviour. This could include investigating how animals that are better at learning might be better at avoiding toxins in the environment.

== Effects on reproductive behaviours ==

Reproductive behaviour effects may involve changes in courtship and mating behaviours, mate choice, or changes in nest building.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most studies on this topic have been conducted on fish and birds. For example, treating adult male zebra fish with biphenol A for 7 weeks resulted in decreased courtship behaviour of females.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gore|first=Andrea C.|last2=Holley|first2=Amanda M.|last3=Crews|first3=David|date=2017|title=Mate choice, sexual selection, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2017.09.001|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2017.09.001|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 17β-trenbolone exposure in adult guppies and mosquitofish also altered female mate selection, as they preferred unexposed males.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Guppies treated with atrazine during breeding and through gestation were less likely to engage in and showed fewer numbers of courtship displays and other reproductive behaviours. Additionally, females preferred untreated males.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Studies on birds show significant effects of EDCs on mating songs and displays. For example, treating female zebra finches with PCBs before egg laying resulted in a size reduction in the song centres of the chick’s brains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Methylmercury exposure at environmental levels for 3 years in male white ibises resulted in increased homosexual behaviour, decreased rates of key courtship behaviours, and less attractiveness to females.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frederick|first=Peter|last2=Jayasena|first2=Nilmini|date=2011-06-22|title=Altered pairing behaviour and reproductive success in white ibises exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of methylmercury|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/278/1713/1851|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=278|issue=1713|pages=1851–1857|doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.2189|issn=0962-8452|pmid=21123262|pmc=3097836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mammals are also susceptible, and effects on individuals have been shown to have transgenerational and even population-level consequences. Illustrating this, female rats three generations removed from vinclozolin exposure show changes in mate preference, preferring unexposed mates, while male rats do not, and this could have complex effects on the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crews|first=D.|last2=Gore|first2=A. C.|last3=Hsu|first3=T. S.|last4=Dangleben|first4=N. L.|last5=Spinetta|first5=M.|last6=Schallert|first6=T.|last7=Anway|first7=M. D.|last8=Skinner|first8=M. K.|date=2007|title=Transgenerational epigenetic imprints on mate preference|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/do%20I/10.1073/pnas.0610410104|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=104|issue=14|pages=5942–5946|doi=10.1073/pnas.0610410104|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation implications ==
Chemical-induced changes in animal behaviour often have consequences for wild populations. The effects of concern aren’t limited to reproductive effects, which have obvious implications for population vitality. For example, frogs exposed to pesticide-levels found in the environment demonstrate hyperactivity, whip-like convulsions, and depressed avoidance behaviour, which may increase their vulnerability to predation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

As well, guppies from crude oil-polluted environments are less exploratory after both short-term and long-term exposure. This may weaken their foraging efficiency and resource-use diversity, thus posing a threat to the population viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacquin|first=L.|last2=Dybwad|first2=C.|last3=Rolshausen|first3=G.|last4=Hendry|first4=A. P.|last5=Reader|first5=S. M.|date=2017-01-01|title=Evolutionary and immediate effects of crude-oil pollution: depression of exploratory behaviour across populations of Trinidadian guppies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-016-1027-9|journal=Animal Cognition|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=97–108|doi=10.1007/s10071-016-1027-9|issn=1435-9448}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic is therefore quite important for understanding how human-impacts on the environment may threaten populations. Additionally, if abnormal behaviours can be used as indicators of toxic pollution, then this provides a much more accessible mode of toxicology science. Therefore, there is potential for engaging [[Citizen science|citizen scientists]] in environmental research.

== Noise and light pollution ==
[[Pollutant|Pollutants]] are not always chemicals. They can be other unnatural stimuli introduced to the environment by humans, such as noise and light pollution. Anthropogenic noise and light can result in altered antipredator behaviour, reproductive behaviour, communication, foraging behaviour, population distribution, male-male competition and more. However, the mechanisms behind these altered behaviours is relatively unknown within the literature.

=== Noise pollution ===

===== Birds =====
[[File:White-crowned-Sparrow.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:White-crowned-Sparrow.jpg|thumb|Male white-crowned sparrows approach intruders more closely when exposed to noise pollution]]
Noise pollution is widespread, which is mostly a result of transportation networks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Jesse R.|last2=Crooks|first2=Kevin R.|last3=Fristrup|first3=Kurt M.|date=March 2010|title=The costs of chronic noise exposure for terrestrial organisms|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534709002614|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=25|issue=3|pages=180–189|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2009.08.002|issn=0169-5347}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although there are many effects of noise pollution, two specific consequences are adjustments in population distribution and modified animal communication. Birds provide a clear example of both of these consequences. Altered population distributions can affect inter-species interactions. For example, the diversity of birds in the woodlands of New Mexico was significantly reduced in areas with unnatural noise levels&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Clinton D.|last2=Ortega|first2=Catherine P.|last3=Cruz|first3=Alexander|date=August 2009|title=Noise Pollution Changes Avian Communities and Species Interactions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982209013281|journal=Current Biology|volume=19|issue=16|pages=1415–1419|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.06.052|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This change in diversity resulted in less nest predation, which was explained by the decreased presence of the dominant predator - the scrub-jay. This effect has also been observed in owls. A negative correlation was found between the noise intensity of an area and the probability that a long-eared owl will reside in that region&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fröhlich|first=Arkadiusz|last2=Ciach|first2=Michał|date=2017-10-31|title=Noise shapes the distribution pattern of an acoustic predator|url=https://academic.oup.com/cz/article/64/5/575/4582952|journal=Current Zoology|language=en|volume=64|issue=5|pages=575–583|doi=10.1093/cz/zox061|issn=1674-5507|pmc=6178792|pmid=30323836}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Suggested explanations for this outcome are that hunting efficiency was diminished and communication was less effective.

Noise pollution also affects conspecific communication. High noise levels may require animals to adjust their vocalizations in order for communication to remain effective. Bird songs are a well-studied component of animal communication. The use of adjusted songs was observed in Savannah sparrows residing in noisy environments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curry|first=Claire M.|last2=Des Brisay|first2=Paulson G.|last3=Rosa|first3=Patricia|last4=Koper|first4=Nicola|date=2018-03-02|title=Noise Source and Individual Physiology Mediate Effectiveness of Bird Songs Adjusted to Anthropogenic Noise|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22253-5|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-22253-5|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5834586|pmid=29500452}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Adjusted songs were so distinct that their use in the control environment did not result in responses (i.e. aggressive territorial behaviour) typically observed when non-adjusted songs were vocalized. Failure to recognize conspecific vocalizations can also be detrimental to male-male competition. Male urban white-crowned sparrows approached stimulus songs of intruders more closely, regardless of song type, when in the presence of noise pollution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Jennifer N.|last2=Derryberry|first2=Elizabeth P.|date=2018-05-14|title=Urban sparrows respond to a sexually selected trait with increased aggression in noise|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25834-6|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-25834-6|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5951809|pmid=29760398}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A higher frequency of harmful fights is a suggested consequence of this behaviour because of the relatively small distance between the intruding and defending males.

==== Marine animals ====
Noise pollution can also affect marine animals. There are many sources of noise in the world's oceans, such as the sounds produced by commercial shipping, sonars and acoustic deterrents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Marine Mammals and Noise: A Sound Approach to Research and Management|last=|first=|date=2007|work=|access-date=|publisher=Marine Mammal Commission|type=Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Unnatural noise levels can negatively affect reproductive behaviour, such as courtship behaviours. For example, painted goby males did not take part in visual courtship behaviour when in a noisy environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Jong|first=Karen|last2=Amorim|first2=M. Clara P.|last3=Fonseca|first3=Paulo J.|last4=Fox|first4=Clive J.|last5=Heubel|first5=Katja U.|date=June 2018|title=Noise can affect acoustic communication and subsequent spawning success in fish|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0269749117326064|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=237|pages=814–823|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2017.11.003|issn=0269-7491}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Female painted gobies in this experiment were also less likely to spawn in a noisy environment. Noise pollution can also affect foraging behaviour in marine animals, which results in less effective strategies. Porpoises have been found to make fewer prey capture attempts, dive deeper, and cut their foraging behaviour short when a vessel passes by, which results in a higher energy expenditure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wisniewska|first=Danuta Maria|last2=Johnson|first2=Mark|last3=Teilmann|first3=Jonas|last4=Siebert|first4=Ursula|last5=Galatius|first5=Anders|last6=Dietz|first6=Rune|last7=Madsen|first7=Peter Teglberg|date=2018-02-14|title=High rates of vessel noise disrupt foraging in wild harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena)|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/285/1872/20172314|journal=Proc.

Shore crabs were also observed interrupting their foraging behaviour when in the presence of ship noise&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wale|first=Matthew A.|last2=Simpson|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Radford|first3=Andrew N.|date=July 2013|title=Noise negatively affects foraging and antipredator behaviour in shore crabs|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347213001991|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=86|issue=1|pages=111–118|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.001|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Antipredator behaviour in marine animals has also been known to change when noise levels are high. Shore crabs took longer to return to their shelters when in the presence of ship noise&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. ''Neolamprologus pulcher'' (a cichlid fish) females defended their nest less against predators when boat noise was present&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bruintjes|first=Rick|last2=Radford|first2=Andrew N.|date=June 2013|title=Context-dependent impacts of anthropogenic noise on individual and social behaviour in a cooperatively breeding fish|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347213001462|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=85|issue=6|pages=1343–1349|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.03.025|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Recommendations for marine animals ====
Specific mitigation strategies and recommendations have been presented by the Marine Mammal Commission (2007). They offer multiple ways to alleviate noise pollution in the ocean. Some strategies include removing the source of noise, employing sound attenuation devices, limiting the use of the sound source and monitoring operational requirements. They recommend improving research programs, creating consistent regulation standards that are better enforced and improving mitigation strategies.

=== Light pollution ===
Light pollution affects multiple aspects of animal behaviour, such as reproductive behaviour, foraging behaviour and antipredator behaviour. Altered reproductive behaviour has been observed in multiple taxa. Female crickets were less captious of males when they were raised in bright artificial light&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Botha|first=L. Michael|last2=Jones|first2=Therésa M.|last3=Hopkins|first3=Gareth R.|date=July 2017|title=Effects of lifetime exposure to artificial light at night on cricket (Teleogryllus commodus) courtship and mating behaviour|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347217301574|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=129|pages=181–188|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.05.020|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Male crickets that were raised under continuous artificial light were discriminated against more than male crickets raised in darkness or moonlight. Female fireflies also altered their reproductive behaviour by failing to flash when placed under artificial light and males never flashed in response to these females&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Firebaugh|first=Ariel|last2=Haynes|first2=Kyle J.|date=August 2018|title=Light pollution may create demographic traps for nocturnal insects|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S143917911830063X|journal=Basic and Applied Ecology|doi=10.1016/j.baae.2018.07.005|issn=1439-1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, it is not only insects that are affected by light pollution. Male green frogs made less calls and moved more often when in the presence of artificial light&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=B.J.|last2=Richardson|first2=J.M.L.|date=October 2006|title=The effect of artificial light on male breeding-season behaviour in green frogs, Rana clamitans melanota|url=https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrcresearchpress.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1139%2Fz06-142|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume=84|issue=10|pages=1528–1532|doi=10.1139/z06-142|issn=0008-4301}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to Baker and Richardson (2006), these behavioural changes negatively affect breeding success.
[[File:Bats flying (9413217529).jpg|thumb|Bats miss optimal foraging time when exposed to light pollution.]]
Another consequence of light pollution is the disruption of foraging behaviour in wildlife, such as where and when they forage or hunt. Beach mice used foraging patches near sodium vapor lights or yellow bug lights less often than non-lit patches and they also harvested fewer seeds from these lit patches&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bird|first=Brittany L.|last2=Branch|first2=Lyn C.|last3=Miller|first3=Deborah L.|date=2004|title=Effects of Coastal Lighting on Foraging Behavior of Beach Mice|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3589011|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=18|pages=1435-1439|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This study also hypothesizes that artificial light may alter the movement of mice because of predation risks. Bats are another animal that are greatly affected by light pollution. The presence of artificial lights is associated with a delayed emergence of bats from their dwellings and less time spent emerged&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boldogh|first=Sándor|last2=Dobrosi|first2=Dénes|last3=Samu|first3=Péter|date=December 2007|title=The effects of the illumination of buildings on house-dwelling bats and its conservation consequences|url=https://www.bioone.org/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bioone.org%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.3161%2F1733-5329%25282007%25299%255B527%253ATEOTIO%255D2.0.CO%253B2|journal=Acta Chiropterologica|language=en-US|volume=9|issue=2|pages=527–534|doi=10.3161/1733-5329(2007)9[527:teotio]2.0.co;2|issn=1508-1109}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This alteration in foraging behaviour causes bats to miss the most optimal hunting time for insects&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. According to this study, as little as one hour of artificial light exposure after dusk disrupts the bats foraging behaviour, as well as growth rates.

Light pollution can also alter antipredator behaviour in wildlife. When moths come within a close proximity of a hunting bat, they make a powerdive towards the ground&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roeder|first=Kenneth D.|last2=Treat|first2=Asher E.|date=1961|title=The detection and evasion of bats by moths|url=|journal=American Scientist|volume=49|pages=135-148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Roeder &amp; Treat, 1961). If moths are in the presence of artificial light, they are less likely to make this powerdive manoeuver, which results in a reduced ability to evade bat predation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wakefield|first=Andrew|last2=Stone|first2=Emma L.|last3=Jones|first3=Gareth|last4=Harris|first4=Stephen|date=2015-08-01|title=Light-emitting diode street lights reduce last-ditch evasive manoeuvres by moths to bat echolocation calls|url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/2/8/150291|journal=Open Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=8|pages=150291|doi=10.1098/rsos.150291|issn=2054-5703|pmc=4555863|pmid=26361558}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A suggested explanation for this behaviour, according to this study, is that moths turn their ultrasound detection off in daylight (or simulated daylight). Predator-prey interactions are also altered by noise pollution. An example of this is in loggerhead turtles and ghost crabs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=Elton|last2=Marco|first2=Adolfo|last3=da Graça|first3=Jesemine|last4=Pérez|first4=Héctor|last5=Abella|first5=Elena|last6=Patino-Martinez|first6=Juan|last7=Martins|first7=Samir|last8=Almeida|first8=Corrine|date=August 2017|title=Light pollution affects nesting behavior of loggerhead turtles and predation risk of nests and hatchlings|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1011134417302543|journal=Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology|volume=173|pages=240–249|doi=10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2017.06.006|issn=1011-1344}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ghost crabs are attracted to artificial lights and begin to exhibit more aggressive predatory behaviour in the presence of the light. This study hypothesizes that loggerhead hatchling predation would also increase as a result of this modified predatory behaviour and the predator-prey relationship would, therefore, be altered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28597">'''Psychological manipulation''' is a type of [[social influence]] that aims to change the behavior or [[perception]] of others through [[abuse|abusive]], [[deceptive]], or underhanded tactics.&lt;ref name=braiker/&gt; By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive. 

[[Social influence]] is not necessarily negative. For example, people such as friends, family and doctors, can try to [[persuade]] to change clearly unhelpful habits and behaviors. Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless when it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject it, and is not unduly coercive. Depending on the context and motivations, social influence may constitute underhanded manipulation.

==Requirements for successful manipulation==
According to psychology author [[George K. Simon]], successful psychological manipulation primarily involves the manipulator:&lt;ref name=simon&gt;{{Cite book|title=In Sheep's Clothing: Understanding and Dealing with Manipulative People |first=George K|last=Simon |year=1996 |isbn=978-1-935166-30-6}} (reference for the entire section)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Concealing [[aggression|aggressive]] intentions and behaviors and being affable.
# Knowing the psychological [[vulnerabilities]] of the victim to determine which tactics are likely to be the most effective.
# Having a sufficient level of ruthlessness to have no qualms about causing harm to the victim if necessary.

Consequently, the manipulation is likely to be accomplished through covert aggressive ([[relational aggression|relational aggressive]] or [[passive aggressive]]) means.&lt;ref name=simon/&gt;

==How manipulators control their victims==

===According to Braiker===
Harriet B. Braiker (2004) identified the following ways that manipulators [[Abusive power and control|control]] their victims:&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-07-144672-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Positive reinforcement]]: includes [[praise]], [[superficial charm]], superficial [[sympathy]] ([[crocodile tears]]), excessive apologizing, money, approval, [[gifts]], attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or [[smile]], and public recognition.
* [[Negative reinforcement]]: involves removing one from a negative situation as a reward, e.g. "You won't have to do your homework if you allow me to do this to you."
*[[Reinforcement#Intermittent reinforcement; schedules|Intermittent or partial reinforcement]]: Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective [[climate of fear]] and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to persist - for example in most forms of gambling, the gambler is likely to win now and again but still lose money overall.
* [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]]: includes [[nagging]], [[screaming|yelling]], the [[silent treatment]], [[intimidation]], threats, [[profanity|swearing]], [[emotional blackmail]], the [[guilt trip]], sulking, crying, and [[playing the victim]].
* Traumatic one-trial learning: using verbal abuse, explosive anger, or other intimidating behavior to establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can [[classical conditioning|condition]] or train victims to avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator.

===According to Simon===
Simon identified the following manipulative techniques:&lt;ref name=simon /&gt;&lt;!--All bulleted information in this section is from Simon's book, needing no further citation--&gt;

* [[Lie|Lying]] (by commission) : It is hard to tell if somebody is lying at the time they do it, although often the truth may be apparent later when it is too late. One way to minimize the chances of being lied to is to understand that some personality types (particularly [[psychopaths]]) are experts at the art of lying and [[cheating]], doing it frequently, and often in subtle ways.
* [[Lie#Lying by omission|Lying by omission]]: This is a very subtle form of lying by withholding a significant amount of the truth. This technique is also used in [[propaganda]].
* [[Denial]]: Manipulator refuses to admit that they have done something wrong.
* [[Rationalization (psychology)|Rationalization]]: An excuse made by the manipulator for inappropriate behavior. Rationalization is closely related to [[Spin (public relations)|spin]].
* [[Minimisation (psychology)|Minimization]]: This is a type of denial coupled with rationalization. The manipulator asserts that their behavior is not as harmful or irresponsible as someone else was suggesting, for example, saying that a taunt or insult was only a joke.
* Selective inattention or selective [[attention]]: Manipulator refuses to pay attention to anything that may distract from their agenda, saying things like "I don't want to hear it".
* [[Distraction|Diversion]]: Manipulator not giving a straight answer to a straight question and instead being diversionary, steering the conversation onto another topic.
* [[Evasion (ethics)|Evasion]]: Similar to diversion but giving irrelevant, rambling, vague responses, [[weasel words]].
* Covert [[intimidation]]: Manipulator throwing the victim onto the defensive by using veiled (subtle, indirect or implied) threats.
* [[Guilt trip]]: A special kind of intimidation tactic. A manipulator suggests to the [[conscientious]] victim that they do not care enough, are too selfish or have it easy. This usually results in the victim feeling bad, keeping them in a [[doubt|self-doubting]], [[anxious]] and [[submissive]] position.
* [[Shaming]]: Manipulator uses [[sarcasm]] and put-downs to increase [[fear]] and [[doubt|self-doubt]] in the victim. Manipulators use this tactic to make others feel unworthy and therefore defer to them. Shaming tactics can be very subtle such as a fierce look or glance, unpleasant tone of voice, rhetorical comments, subtle sarcasm. Manipulators can make one feel ashamed for even daring to challenge them. It is an effective way to foster a sense of inadequacy in the victim.
* [[Victim blaming|Vilifying the victim]]: More than any other, this tactic is a powerful means of putting the victim on the defensive while simultaneously masking the aggressive intent of the manipulator, while the manipulator falsely accuses the victim as being an abuser in response when the victim stands up for or defends themselves or their position.
* Playing the victim role: Manipulator portrays themself as a victim of circumstance or of someone else's behavior in order to gain [[pity]], [[sympathy]] or evoke [[compassion]] and thereby get something from another. Caring and conscientious people cannot stand to see anyone suffering and the manipulator often finds it easy to play on sympathy to get cooperation.
* Playing the servant role: Cloaking a self-serving agenda in guise of a service to a more noble cause, for example saying they are acting in a certain way to be "obedient" to or in "service" to an [[authority figure]] or "just doing their job".
* [[Seduction]]: Manipulator uses [[superficial charm|charm]], [[praise]], [[flattery]] or overtly supporting others in order to get them to lower their defenses and give their [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] and [[loyalty]] to the manipulator. They will also offer help with the intent to gain trust and access to an unsuspecting victim they have charmed.
* [[Psychological projection|Projecting]] the [[blame]] (blaming others): Manipulator [[scapegoats]] in often subtle, hard-to-detect ways. Often, the manipulator will project their own thinking onto the victim, making the victim look like they have done something wrong. Manipulators will also claim that the victim is the one who is at fault for believing lies that they were conned into believing, as if the victim forced the manipulator to be deceitful. All blame, except for the part that is used by the manipulator to accept false guilt, is done in order to make the victim feel guilty about making healthy choices, correct thinking and good behaviors. It is frequently used as a means of psychological and emotional manipulation and control. Manipulators lie about lying, only to re-manipulate the original, less believable story into a "more acceptable" truth that the victim will believe. Projecting lies as being the truth is another common method of control and manipulation. Manipulators love to falsely accuse the victim as "deserving to be treated that way." They often claim that the victim is crazy and/or abusive, especially when there is evidence against the manipulator. (See Feigning, below.)
* Feigning [[innocence]]: Manipulator tries to suggest that any harm done was unintentional or that they did not do something that they were accused of. Manipulator may put on a look of surprise or indignation. This tactic makes the victim question their own [[judgment]] and possibly their own sanity.
* Feigning [[confusion]]: Manipulator tries to play dumb by pretending they do not know what the victim is talking about or is confused about an important issue brought to their attention. The manipulator intentionally confuses the victim in order for the victim to doubt their own accuracy of perception, often pointing out key elements that the manipulator intentionally included in case there is room for doubt. Sometimes manipulators will have used cohorts in advance to help back up their story.
* Brandishing [[anger]]: Manipulator uses anger to brandish sufficient emotional intensity and [[Rage (emotion)|rage]] to shock the victim into submission. The manipulator is not actually angry, they just put on an act. They just want what they want and get "angry" when denied. Controlled anger is often used as a manipulation tactic to avoid confrontation, avoid telling the truth or to further hide intent. There are often threats used by the manipulator of going to police, or falsely reporting abuses that the manipulator intentionally contrived to scare or intimidate the victim into submission. Blackmail and other threats of exposure are other forms of controlled anger and manipulation, especially when the victim refuses initial requests or suggestions by the manipulator. Anger is also used as a defense so the manipulator can avoid telling truths at inconvenient times or circumstances. Anger is often used as a tool or defense to ward off inquiries or suspicion. The victim becomes more focused on the anger instead of the manipulation tactic.
* Bandwagon effect: Manipulator comforts the victim into submission by claiming (whether true or false) that many people already have done something, and the victim should as well. These include phrases such as "Many people like you&amp;nbsp;..." or "Everyone does this anyways." Such manipulation can be seen in [[peer pressure]] situations, often occurring in scenarios where the manipulator attempts to influence the victim into trying [[drugs]] or other substances.

===Vulnerabilities exploited by manipulators===
According to Braiker's self-help book,&lt;ref name=braiker /&gt; manipulators exploit the following vulnerabilities (buttons) that may exist in victims:
* the "disease to please"
* addiction to earning the approval and acceptance of others
* Emotophobia (fear of negative emotion; ''i.e.'' a fear of expressing anger, frustration or disapproval)
* lack of [[assertiveness]] and ability to say no
* blurry sense of identity (with soft [[personal boundaries]])
* low [[Self-sufficiency|self-reliance]]
* external [[locus of control]]

According to Simon,&lt;ref name=simon /&gt; manipulators exploit the following vulnerabilities that may exist in victims:
* naïveté - victim finds it too hard to accept the idea that some people are cunning, devious and ruthless or is "in [[denial]]" if they are being victimized.
* over-[[conscientiousness]] - victim is too willing to give manipulator the benefit of the doubt and see their side of things in which they blame the victim.
* low self-[[confidence]] - victim is [[doubt|self-doubting]], lacking in confidence and [[assertiveness]], likely to go on the defensive too easily.
* over-[[intellectualization]] - victim tries too hard to understand and believes the manipulator has some understandable reason to be hurtful.
* emotional [[codependent|dependency]] - victim has a [[submissive]] or dependent personality. The more emotionally dependent the victim is, the more vulnerable they are to being exploited and manipulated.

Manipulators generally take the time to scope out the characteristics and vulnerabilities of their victims.

Kantor advises in his book ''The Psychopathology of Everyday Life: How to Deal with Manipulative People''&lt;ref name=Kantor&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Psychopathology of Everyday Life: How to Deal with Manipulative People |first=Martin|last=Kantor |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-275-98798-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that vulnerability to [[psychopathic]] manipulators involves being too:
* [[Dependent personality disorder|dependent]] - dependent people need to be loved and are therefore gullible and liable to say yes to something to which they should say no.
* [[Maturity (psychological)|immature]] - has impaired judgment and so tends to believe exaggerated advertising claims.
* [[naïve]] - cannot believe there are dishonest people in the world, or takes it for granted that if there are any, they will not be allowed to prey on others.
* [[impressionable]] - overly seduced by [[superficial charm|charmers]]. For example, they might vote for the seemingly charming politician who kisses babies.
* [[trusting]] - people who are honest often assume that everyone else is honest. They are more likely to commit themselves to people they hardly know without checking credentials, etc., and less likely to question so-called experts.
* [[Carelessness]] not giving sufficient amount of thought or attention on harm or errors.
* [[Loneliness|lonely]] - lonely people may accept any offer of human contact. A psychopathic stranger may offer human companionship for a price.
* [[narcissistic]] - narcissists are prone to falling for unmerited flattery.
* [[Impulsivity|impulsive]] - make snap decisions about, for example, what to buy or whom to marry without consulting others.
* [[altruistic]] - the opposite of psychopathic: too honest, too fair, too empathetic.
* [[frugal]] - cannot say no to a bargain even if they know the reason it is so cheap.
* [[materialistic]] - easy prey for [[loan sharks]] or [[get-rich-quick]] schemes.
* [[greed]]y - the greedy and dishonest may fall prey to a psychopath who can easily entice them to act in an immoral way.
* [[Masochistic personality disorder|masochistic]] - lack self-respect and so unconsciously let psychopaths take advantage of them. They think they deserve it out of a sense of guilt.
* the [[elderly]] - the elderly can become fatigued and less capable of multi-tasking. When hearing a sales pitch they are less likely to consider that it could be a con. They are prone to giving money to someone with a hard-luck story. See [[elder abuse]].

==Motivations of manipulators==
Manipulators can have various possible motivations, including but not limited to:&lt;ref name=braiker /&gt;
* the need to advance their own purposes and personal gain at virtually any cost to others
* a strong need to attain feelings of [[Abusive power and control|power]] and superiority in relationships with others
* a want and need to feel in [[Abusive power and control|control]]
* a desire to gain a feeling of power over others in order to raise their perception of [[self-esteem]]
* boredom, or growing tired of their surroundings, seeing it as a game more than hurting others
* covert agenda, criminal or otherwise, including financial manipulation (often seen when the elderly or unsuspecting, unprotected wealthy are intentionally targeted for the sole purpose of obtaining a victim's financial assets)

==Psychopathy ==
{{Main article|Psychopathy}}
Being manipulative is in Factor 1 of the [[Hare Psychopathy Checklist]] (PCL).&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1529100611426706 |pmid=26167886 |title=Psychopathic Personality: Bridging the Gap Between Scientific Evidence and Public Policy |year=2011 |last1=Skeem |first1=J.

=== In the workplace ===
{{Main article|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
The workplace psychopath may often rapidly shift between emotions – used to manipulate people or cause high anxiety.&lt;ref name=Faggioni&gt;Faggioni M &amp; White M Organizational Psychopaths - Who Are They and How to Protect Your Organization from Them (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the book ''[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]'' describe a five phase model of how a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains [[Power (social and political)|power]]. In phase three (manipulation) - the psychopath will create a scenario of "[[Cognitive distortion|psychopathic fiction]]" where positive information about themselves and negative [[disinformation]] about others will be created, where your role as a part of a network of [[Flying monkeys (psychology)|pawns or patrons]] will be utilised and you will be [[Operant conditioning|groomed]] into accepting the psychopath's agenda.&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; [[Robert D. Hare|Hare, R. D]] [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate jargon Variously known as corporate speak, corporate lingo, business speak, business jargon, management speak, workplace jargon, or commercialese, is the jargon often used in large corporations, bureaucracies, and similar workplaces.[1][2] The use of corporate jargon, also known as "corporatese", is criticised for its lack of clarity as well as for its tedium, making meaning and intention opaque and understanding difficult.
 
Sophism In modern useage sophist and sophistry are redefined and used disparagingly. A sophism is a specious argument for displaying ingenuity in reasoning or for deceiving someone. A sophist is a person who reasons with clever but fallacious and deceptive arguments. 

Impression Management (unethical). In business, "managing impressions" normally "involves someone trying to control the image that a significant stakeholder has of them". The ethics of impression management has been hotly debated on whether we should see it as an effective self-revelation or as cynical manipulation.

==Antisocial, borderline and narcissistic personality disorders==
According to [[Otto Kernberg|Kernberg]], [[Antisocial Personality Disorder|antisocial]], [[Borderline Personality Disorder|borderline]], and [[Narcissistic Personality Disorder|narcissistic]] personality disorders are all organized at a borderline level of personality organization,&lt;ref name="Kernberg75"&gt;{{cite book | title=Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism | publisher=Jason Aronson | author=Kernberg, O | year=1975 | location=New York | isbn=978-0-87668-205-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the three share some common characterological deficits and overlapping personality traits, with deceitfulness and exceptional manipulative abilities being the most common traits among antisocial and narcissism. Borderline is emphasized by unintentional and dysfunctional manipulation, but stigma towards borderlines being deceitful still wrongfully persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stigma and Prejudice|last=Aguirre|first=Blaise|date=2016|publisher=Humana Press, Cham|isbn=9783319275789|series=Current Clinical Psychiatry|pages=133–143|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-27580-2_8|chapter = Borderline Personality Disorder: From Stigma to Compassionate Care}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisocials, borderlines, and narcissists are often [[Pathological lying|pathological liars]].&lt;ref name=Kernberg75 /&gt; Other shared traits may include pathological narcissism,&lt;ref name="Kernberg75"/&gt; consistent irresponsibility, [[machiavellianism]], lack of [[empathy]],&lt;ref name="sbc"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Science of Evil: On Empathy and the Origins of Cruelty | publisher=Basic Books | author=Baron-Cohen, S | year=2012 | pages=45–98 | isbn=978-0-465-03142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; cruelty, [[meanness]], impulsivity, proneness to self-harm and addictions,&lt;ref name="C&amp;C02"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Casillas, A. |author2=Clark, L.A.k |title=Dependency, impulsivity, and self-harm: traits hypothesized to underlie the association between cluster B personality and substance use disorders |journal=Journal of  Personality Disorders|volume=16 |issue= 5|pages=424–36 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12489309 |doi=10.1521/pedi.16.5.424.22124}}&lt;/ref&gt; interpersonal exploitation, hostility, anger and rage, vanity, emotional instability, rejection sensitivity, perfectionism, and the use of primitive [[defence mechanisms]] that are pathological and narcissistic. Common [[narcissistic defences]] include [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]], [[denial]], [[Psychological projection|projection]], [[projective identification]], primitive [[idealization and devaluation]], [[Cognitive distortion|distortion]] (including [[exaggeration]], [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]] and [[lie]]s), and [[omnipotence]].&lt;ref name=OK93&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kernberg|first1=O.|title=Severe Personality Disorders: Psychotherapeutic Strategies|date=1993|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-05349-4|pages=15–18|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Marsha M. Linehan]] has stated that people with borderline personality disorder often exhibit behaviors which are not truly manipulative, but are erroneously interpreted as such.&lt;ref name=marsha2222&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toddlertime.com/mh/terms/manipulation.htm |title=On Manipulation with the Borderline Personality |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=ToddlerTime Network |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her, these behaviors often appear as unthinking manifestations of intense pain, and are often not deliberate as to be considered truly manipulative. In the [[DSM-V]], manipulation was removed as a defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stigma and Prejudice|last=Aguirre|first=Blaise|date=2016|publisher=Humana Press, Cham|isbn=9783319275789|series=Current Clinical Psychiatry|pages=133–143|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-27580-2_8|chapter = Borderline Personality Disorder: From Stigma to Compassionate Care}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manipulative behavior is intrinsic to narcissists, who use manipulation to obtain power and [[narcissistic supply]]. Those with antisocial personalities will manipulate for material items, power, revenge, and a wide variety of other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Histrionic personality disorder==
{{Main article|Histrionic personality disorder}}
People with histrionic personality disorder are usually high-functioning, both socially and professionally. They usually have good [[social skills]], despite tending to use them to manipulate others into making them the center of attention.&lt;ref name=Cleveland&gt;{{cite web | publisher=The Cleveland Clinic | title =Histrionic Personality Disorder | url=http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/health-info/docs/3700/3795.asp?index=9743 | accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Machiavellianism==
{{Main article|Machiavellianism|Machiavellian intelligence}}
Machiavellianism is a term that some [[Social psychology|social]] and [[Personality psychology|personality]] psychologists use to describe a person's tendency to be unemotional, and therefore able to detach themselves from conventional morality and hence to [[deceive]] and manipulate others. In the 1960s, Richard Christie and Florence L. Geis developed a test for measuring a person's level of Machiavellianism (sometimes referred to as the ''Machiavelli test'').&lt;ref&gt;Christie, R., and F. L. Geis. (1970) "How devious are you? Take the Machiavelli test to find out." ''Journal of Management in Engineering'' 15.4: 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6444">The rod and frame test is a [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] method of testing [[perception]]. It relies on the use of a rod and frame apparatus which uses a rotating rod set inside an individually rotatable drum, allowing an experimenter to vary the participant's frame of reference and thus test for their perception of vertical.

==Rod and frame illusion==
[[File:Rod and Frame Apparatus.png|thumb|Picture 1. A picture taken of the Rod and Frame apparatus originally sold by the Stoelting company, and now owned by the Rochester Institute of Technology.]]
Rod and frame illusion occurs because of the effect of the orientation of the frame on the rod. In the simplest example of the rod and frame illusion, the illusion will cause the participant to perceive the rod to be oriented congruent with the orientation of the frame.&lt;ref name=Corbett&gt;Corbett and Ennis. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; When the participant is viewing the rod and frame that are both positioned at 0 degrees (or vertical), he or she perceives the rod as vertical with perfect accuracy. However, when the frame is tilted away from vertical, the participant's perception of vertical is affected. The participant tends to perceive the rod to be tilted in the same direction as the frame is oriented (e.g., if the frame is tilted in the counterclockwise direction, the rod will also be perceived as being tilted counterclockwise). As the tilt of the frame increases, the participants' perceived vertical increasingly deviates from true vertical.

==Rod and frame test==
To perform the rod and frame task, an apparatus consisting of a rod in a square frame is used. An example commercial apparatus can be seen in picture 1. When the participant is being tested using the apparatus, their head is fastened firmly in the chin rest to prevent the participant from collecting visual cues from outside of the apparatus. The rod and frame are shown in the center of the far end of the apparatus, which provides a [[frame of reference]] to the participant. Both the participant and the experimenter are able to adjust the orientation of the rod, while only the experimenter can adjust the frame orientation by using the appropriate knobs on the apparatus, as seen in picture 2. The experimenter is able to see the exact degree measurement of the rod and frame from vertical, while the participant sees the physical rod and frame inside the apparatus. 

The methods of constant stimuli, limits, and adjustment can be used to test the participants, but method of limits is most commonly used in research conducted using the rod and frame task.&lt;ref name="Wenderoth"&gt;Wenderoth, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; When using the method of limits, the experimenter sets the orientation of the rod and frame separately and then the participant is asked to adjust the rod orientation until they perceive it to be vertical. Deviation from true vertical can then be determined. Based on which way the frame is tilted, the rod can be viewed as either being tilted in the same direction as the frame (direct effect), or in the opposite direction of the frame (indirect effect).

==Evidence==
[[File:Example of Perceived Vertical.jpg|thumb|Picture 2. An image showing a 10-degree frame angle and a 7-degree rod angle. Observers using the apparatus see the rod as vertically oriented. The frame of the page, image border, etc. make it appear tilted here.]]
The frame of reference with respect to studies of the [[visual system]] refers to perceived reference axes. In the rod and frame illusion, there are a number of things that can influence one's frame of reference. Past research has found that one reason people experience the rod and frame illusion is due to visual-[[Vestibular system|vestibular]] interactions.&lt;ref name=Spinelli&gt;Spinelli, Antonicci, Daini, and Zoccolotti, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when a participant is viewing the rod and frame task while physically tilted, the participant acts as though they are tilted opposite of the orientation of the frame. This suggests that the illusion, in part, is due to the person compensating for their perceived vertical in the direction that is opposite of the frame. Other evidence proposed by researchers that is consistent with this is that, when participants are put on their sides to view the rod and frame task, they rely on their vision when their vestibular and [[proprioceptive]] senses are incongruent with those of their visual senses.&lt;ref name=Corbett/&gt; These findings suggest that the rod and frame illusion is processed in a type of hierarchy, where visual input is at the top, then vestibular cues, and finally proprioceptive cues. In 2010, Lipshits found that, along with this hierarchy of processing, proprioceptive information, as opposed to gravity, is used by the body to determine which way is vertical.&lt;ref name=Lipshits&gt;Lipshits, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Lipshits says that, when we are not able to use vision to determine which way is vertical, we use other cues based on the axis of our head and body.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18198">A '''sacred natural site''' is a natural feature or a large area of land or water having special [[Spirituality|spiritual]] significance to peoples and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Oviedo, G. and Jeanrenaud, S. (2007) 'Protecting sacred natural sites of indigenous and traditional peoples', in Mallarach, J.M. and Papayannis, T. (eds) (2007) Protected Areas and Spirituality, IUCN and Publicacions de l'Abadia de Montserrat, Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred natural sites consist of all types of natural features including mountains, hills, forests, [[Sacred grove|groves]], [[Tree worship|trees]], rivers, lakes, lagoons, caves, islands and springs. The interest in sacred natural sites, from the perspective of [[nature conservation]], lies in the component of [[biological diversity]] that they harbor.

== Overview ==
Sacred natural sites are natural features in or areas of land or water having special spiritual significance to peoples and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Wild, R and McLeod, C (eds) (2008) 'Sacred Natural Sites: Guidelines for Protected Area Managers'. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN&lt;/ref&gt; This working definition is broad and can be used as a basis for more specific articulations. Whilst “sacred natural sites” is the main term used, for reasons of variety and readability, other terms are used interchangeably, including [[sacred site]], [[sacred place]] and sacred area.

The interest in sacred natural sites from the perspective of [[nature conservation]] lies in the components of [[biological diversity]] that they harbour, such as the species of animals and plants, the [[habitat]]s and [[ecosystem]]s, as well as the ecological dynamics and functions that support life within and outside the places. Linked to such biological diversity is the array of distinct [[human culture]]s that care for them and hold them sacred.&lt;ref name=v&gt;Verschuuren, B., Wild, R., McNeely, J., Oviedo G. (eds.), 2010. Sacred Natural Sites, Conserving Culture and Nature. EarthScan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacred natural sites consist of all types of natural features including mountains, hills, forests, groves, rivers, lakes, lagoons, caves, islands and springs. They can vary in size from the very small: an individual tree, small spring, or a single rock formation, to whole landscapes and mountain ranges.  They consist of [[geological formation]]s, distinct [[landform]]s, specific [[ecosystem]]s and [[natural habitat]]s.  They are predominantly [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] but are also found in inshore [[Ocean|marine]] areas, [[island]]s and [[archipelago]]s.  They may also be the location of [[temple]]s, [[shrine]]s, [[mosque]]s and [[Church (building)|church]]es, and they can incorporate other features such as [[pilgrimage]] trails.  In some sites nature is itself sacred, while in others sanctity is conferred by connections with spiritual heroes, religious structures or sacred histories.

== Sacred natural sites and religion==
Sacred natural sites are just one of many domains where religions or belief systems interact with nature. Most if not all religions have [[mythology]], [[cosmology]], [[theology]] or [[ethics]] related to earth, nature and land. Contemporarily, such connections are increasingly being revived or rearticulated through ethical positions expressed for example in statements that many of the mainstream faiths have produced, setting out their relationship to the natural world and their responsibility towards the planet.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

Sacred sites associated with living cultures always have institutions and rules associated with them. These institutions are usually religious or spiritual in nature and may be distinct from other parts of society, while in some communities of indigenous and traditional peoples, sacred site institutions are closely integrated within society with little distinction between the sacred and secular, the religious and civil.

The vast majority of sacred natural sites were arguably founded by indigenous or [[folk religion]]s and [[spirituality|spiritualities]], but many were subsequently adopted or co-opted by mainstream religions. There is consequently a considerable 'layering' and mixing of religious and other spiritual or belief systems. Within the larger mainstream religions there are many if not more autonomous or semi-autonomous sub-groups. While fifty per cent of the world's population profess to belong to either [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]] and many others are [[Hindu]]s or [[Buddhist]]s, 80 per cent of all people ascribe to a mainstream religion, a large part of which continue to adhere to at least some traditional or [[folk religion]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. and Palmer, M. (1997)'The Atlas of Religion', University of California Press, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred natural sites are thus connected to a wide range of socio-cultural systems and institutions, some more complex than others, and to different dynamics of change and cultural interaction.

==Sacred natural sites, indigenous peoples and mainstream faiths==
Establishing a duality between '[[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]]', in the sense of being native or belonging to a place, and 'mainstream', while pragmatic for discussion, does present some problems. Several mainstream faiths can be considered indigenous in much of their range e.g. [[Daoism]], [[Shinto]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], while [[Zoroastrianism]] now has very few followers and is essentially no longer 'mainstream'. More problematic is that this duality renders invisible the many merged or [[syncretic]] faiths and folk variants of mainstream religions where elements of the preceding indigenous beliefs are still practiced. These folk religions can have much stronger nature ethics than the more symbolic orthodox form.

Within human history, religion has been used (or abused) as a tool of domination. These issues, although much reduced, have not gone away and some faiths still seek converts from other faiths. The destruction of [[sacred site]]s has been part of that domination and still continues today. Conversely, most faiths over long periods of time have peaceably co-existed and shared sacred sites. Mutual respect and accommodation have often been reached. Further compassion and peace-building lie at the heart of many religious traditions and belief systems.

==The distribution of sacred natural sites==
Sacred natural sites are, with the exception of [[Antarctica]], found on every continent and probably in every country. Some of them are surely among the oldest venerated places of earth and at the same time new sacred natural sites are still being established, in some cases by migrants to new countries.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N., Higgins-Zogib L and Mansourian, S. (2005) ‘Beyond Belief, Linking faiths and protected areas to support biodiversity conservation’, WWF, Equilibrium and The Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC).&lt;/ref&gt; Paleo-anthropological evidence indicates that earlier humans such as [[Neanderthal]]s practised the cult of ancestors in burial sites over 60,000 years ago, which is arguably one of the origins of sacred sites. [[Ancestor worship]] and veneration of [[burial ground]]s seem to be a common trait of every culture of modern humans, as well as the adoration of natural features of great significance such as high mountains or large rivers. Australian sacred sites may go back at least 50,000 years; [[rock art]] considered of a sacred nature date to 20,000 years ago, and some of the [[Neolithic]] [[henge]]s date from 5,000 years ago.

At a landscape level, [[anthropologist]]s have long recognized the sacred status that cultures have given to nature not only in specific sacred sites,{{cn|date=February 2017}} but also in larger areas of cultural significance and entire landscapes. Interest on the importance of sacred sites for living cultures has seen an upsurge since the mid 1990s, which has contributed to the exploration of new paradigms and multidisciplinary views to the advantage of both the understanding and conservation of sacred sites.&lt;ref&gt;Berkes, F. (1999) ‘Sacred Ecology, Traditional ecological knowledge and resource management’, Taylor &amp; Francis, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, D.L., Hubert, J., Reeves, B. and Schanche, A. (1994) ‘Sacred Sites, Sacred Places’, Routledge, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Posey, D. (ed.) (1999) ‘Cultural and Spiritual Values of Biodiversity’, a comprehensive contribution to the UNEP Global Biodiversity Assessment. Intermediate Technology Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Because of their diversity, origins, and different and varying degrees of sacrality of their elements, it is not really possible to have full knowledge about the number of sacred sites existing in the world today. Exhaustively documenting sacred natural sites would have to be done by bottom-up identification at the community level, which is not really practicable. However, estimates have been made for some countries, notably India, where at least 13,720 [[sacred grove]]s have been reported and experts estimate that the total number for the country may be in the range of 100,000 to 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;Malhotra, K C., Ghokhale, Y., Chatterjee, S. and Srivastava, S. (2001) ‘Cultural and Ecological Dimensions of Sacred Groves in India’, INSA: New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; India may be exceptional because of its size, cultural diversity and widespread practices about sacred groves, but it would not be unrealistic to estimate that sacred natural sites must exist in the hundreds of thousands.

==Importance for the conservation of nature and culture==
Many sacred natural sites have been well protected over long time periods and have seen low levels of utilization.  Many are demonstrably high in [[biodiversity]] and represent a strong biodiversity conservation opportunity.{{cn|date=February 2017}} Sacred natural sites also represent ancient and profound [[cultural]] values. The roles of sacred sites’ custodians from indigenous, local community and mainstream religions are expressions of dedicated efforts that cultures that have specifically, if not always consciously, cared for nature in various ways.

While sacred natural sites are connected to the [[human spirit]] and intangible heritage they also have strong material components. In addition to being places where animals and plant species survive,  they provide resources such as water and medicines and other [[ecosystem service]]s, they are the location of events and ceremonies, and traditionally are sites of education. They link to livelihoods in many ways and the concepts of cultural services and human wellbeing are associated with them.{{cn|date=February 2017}} They support [[pilgrimage]]s and [[tourism]], both of which have large associated service sectors and generate significant economic activity.

==A brief history in conservation==
Following a seminal workshop organized by [[UNESCO]] in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Lee C, Schaaf T. (2003) ‘The Importance of Sacred Natural Sites for Biodiversity Conservation’, Proceedings of the International Workshop held in Kunming and Xishuangbanna Biosphere Reserve, People’s Republic of China, 17–20 February 2003. UNESCO, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaaf T., and Lee, C. (2006) ‘Conserving Cultural and Biological Diversity: The Role of Sacred Natural Sites and Cultural Landscapes’ Proceedings of UNESCO-IUCN International Conference, Tokyo, Japan. UNESCO, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; international conservation organisations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and [[IUCN]], working with indigenous groups and networks such as the [[Rigoberta Menchu Tum Foundation]], started to explore ways to integrate sacred natural sites in their conservation work. A number of international events and processes followed, and case studies and scientific and practitioner articles started to appear in books and journals. In 2003 IUCN’s Specialist Group on the Cultural and Spiritual Values of Protected Areas (CSVPA) and UNESCO started work on guidelines for the management of sacred natural sites.&lt;ref name=Wild&gt;Wild, R and McLeod, C (eds) (2008) 'Sacred Natural Sites: Guidelines for Protected Area Managers'. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN&lt;/ref&gt;  This Group has advanced a significant amount of work on sacred natural sites, including through specific projects such as the [[Delos Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallarach, J M. and Papayannis, T. (eds.) (2007) ‘Protected Areas and Spirituality’, IUCN and Publicacions de l’Abadia de Montserrat. Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Papayannis, T. and Mallarach, J M. (eds) (2009) ‘The Sacred Dimension of Protected Areas’, Proceedings of the Second Workshop of the Delos Initiative – Ouranoupolis 2007. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN and Athens, Greece: Med-INA.&lt;/ref&gt; Among international conservation NGO’s, The [[Nature Conservancy]] has developed a planning tool for the conservation of sacred sites and cultural heritage in protected areas and tested it across countries in [[Central America]] such as [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Secaira, E. and &amp; Molina M E, (2005) ‘Planning for the Conservation of Sacred Sites in the Context of Protected Areas’, an adaptation of a Methodology and lessons from its application in the Highlands of Western Guatemala. The nature conservancy, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; WWF studied sacred sites in one hundred protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley, N., Higgins-Zogib L and Mansourian, S. (2005) ‘Beyond Belief, Linking faiths and protected areas to support biodiversity conservation’, WWF, Equilibrium and The Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC).&lt;/ref&gt;

==International importance of sacred natural sites==
The urgent need for the protection of sacred natural sites has also been recognized by the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the [[UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]]. The CBD in 2004 developed the Akwe Kon voluntary guidelines for the conduct of cultural, environmental and social impact assessments regarding proposed developments that may affect sacred sites and on lands and waters traditionally occupied or used by indigenous and local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2004, Akwé: Kon Voluntary Guidelines for the Conduct of Cultural, Environmental and Social Impact Assessment regarding Developments Proposed to Take Place on, or which are Likely to Impact on, Sacred Sites and on Lands and Waters Traditionally Occupied or Used by Indigenous and Local Communities’, CBD Guidelines Series, Montreal, 25p.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the political level, as described before, the adoption of the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] &lt;ref name=UNDRIP/&gt; is an important benchmark.  Article 12 in particular provides significant political leverage for developing appropriate policies for the protection and recognition of sacred natural sites at the national level. It states:  “Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practice, develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies; the right to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites; the right to the use and control of their ceremonial objects; and the right to the repatriation of their human remains.”.&lt;ref name=UNDRIP&gt;UNDRIP (2007) ‘Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, United Nations’, General Assembly, 61st session, agenda item 68, Report of the Human Rights Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacred natural sites and the ethics of research and inventory==
It is particularly important to raise the concept of free prior, [[informed consent]] (FPIC), which has emerged as a standard for engaging with [[indigenous people]] and local communities. This is particularly important with regard to sacred natural sites.  For many custodians of sacred natural sites [[secrecy]] is of the utmost importance and needs serious consideration and respect.&lt;ref name=Wild/&gt;  At the same time it needs to be recognised that research and inventory can be powerful tools for the communication and conservation of sacred natural sites.

==Sacred natural sites and global change==
Verschuuren et al. (2010) identified significant global changes, many of which affect sacred natural sites and their custodian communities.  These include:&lt;ref name=v/&gt;
*global human [[population increase]],
*modernity and erosion of traditional [[culture]],
*[[biodiversity loss]], [[Habitat destruction|habitat]] and species declines, [[species extinction]] and [[ecosystem]] damage,
*[[industrialization]] of [[agriculture]],  [[forestry]], [[Fishery|fisheries]] or other types of [[Land use|land]] and sea use,
*[[Mining|extractive]] and energy industries,
*growth of cities, [[urbanization]] and transport networks,
*increased conflict over [[natural resource]]s,
*weakened livelihood systems and [[poverty]],
*[[Social change|social]] and political changes and conflicts in the [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] realm,
*[[globalization]] of the dominant economic model based on continual growth, detached from ecological realities,
*decline in [[spirituality|spiritual]] values,
*[[climate change]].

Many of the drivers of these global changes are mutually reinforcing and affect cultural and [[biological diversity]] and the many services that sacred natural sites provide to human well-being. 

Generating a greater recognition of the sacred dimensions of nature focused on sacred natural sites is expected to be an important means of building public support for the policies that conserve biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the diversity of human adaptations to a changing environment.

In one study, respondents were asked how much they were willing to pay to prevent migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds by covering the oil ponds with protective nets. Subjects were told that either 2,000, or 20,000, or 200,000 migrating birds were affected annually, for which subjects reported they were willing to pay $80, $78 and $88 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://rti.org/pubs/bk-0001-1009_web.pdf |doi=10.3768/rtipress.2009.bk.0001.1009 |last1=Desvouges|first1=William F.|first2=Reed|last2=Johnson|first3=Richard|last3=Dunford|first4=Kevin|last4=Boyle|first5=Sarah|last5=Hudson|first6=K. Nicole|last6=Wilson|title=Measuring Non-Use Damages Using Contingent Valuation: An Experimental Evaluation of Accuracy|journal=Research Triangle Institute Monograph|year=1992|volume=92-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies of willingness-to-pay to prevent harm have found a [[logarithm]]ic relationship or no relationship to scope size.&lt;ref name="ksr"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~deutsch/geog111_211a/papers/Kahneman%20on%20attitude%20and%20affection.pdf | last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|last2=Ritov|first2=Ilana|last3=Schkade|first3=Daniel|title=Economic Preferences or Attitude Expressions?: An Analysis of Dollar Responses to Public Issues|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|year=1999|volume=19|pages=203–235|doi=10.1007/978-94-017-1406-8_8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Kahneman]] explains scope neglect in terms of [[judgment by prototype]], a refinement of the [[representativeness heuristic]]. "The story [...] probably evokes for many readers a mental representation of a prototypical incident, perhaps an image of an exhausted bird, its feathers soaked in black oil, unable to escape,"&lt;ref name="krs"&gt;p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; and subjects based their willingness-to-pay mostly on that mental image.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4269">Given an [[DEVS#Atomic DEVS|atomic DEVS]] model, simulation algorithms are methods to generate the model's legal behaviors which are trajectories not to reach to illegal states. (see [[Behavior of DEVS]]). [[Simulation_Algorithms_for_Atomic_DEVS#References|[Zeigler84]]] originally introduced the algorithms that handle time variables related to ''lifespan'' &lt;math&gt;t_s \in [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; and ''elapsed time'' &lt;math&gt;t_e\in [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; by introducing two other time variables, ''last event time'', &lt;math&gt;t_l\in [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, and ''next event time'' &lt;math&gt; t_n\in [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; with the following relations: 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \, t_e = t - t_l &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\, t_s = t_n - t_l &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t\in [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''current time''. And the ''remaining time'',

 &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\,t_r=t_s-t_e&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; is equivalently computed as
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\, t_r = t_n - t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;, apparently &lt;math&gt; t_r \in [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the behavior of a given atomic DEVS model can be defined in two different views depending on the total state and the external transition function (refer to [[Behavior of DEVS]]), the simulation algorithms are also introduced in two different views as below.

== Common parts ==
Regardless of two different views of total states, algorithms for initialization and internal transition cases are commonly defined as below.

 DEVS-simulator
   variables:
     parent // parent coordinator
     &lt;math&gt;t_l&lt;/math&gt;     // time of last event
     &lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt;     // time of next event
     &lt;math&gt;A=(X,Y,S,ta, \delta_{ext}, \delta_{int}, \lambda) &lt;/math&gt;// the associated [[DEVS#Atomic DEVS|Atomic DEVS]] model 
   when receive init-message(Time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
      &lt;math&gt; t_l \leftarrow t;&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_n \leftarrow t_l + ta(s); &lt;/math&gt;
   when receive star-message(Time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
      if &lt;math&gt; t \ne t_n &lt;/math&gt; then
         error: bad synchronization;
      &lt;math&gt; y \leftarrow \lambda(s);&lt;/math&gt;
      send y-message(&lt;math&gt;y,t&lt;/math&gt;) to parent;
      &lt;math&gt; s \leftarrow \delta_{int}(s)&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_l \leftarrow t;&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_n \leftarrow t_l + ta(s); &lt;/math&gt;

== View 1: total states = states * elapsed times ==
As addressed in [[Behavior of Atomic DEVS]], when DEVS receives an input event, right calling &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ext}&lt;/math&gt;, the last event time,&lt;math&gt;t_l&lt;/math&gt; is set by the current time,&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, thus the elapsed time&lt;math&gt;t_e&lt;/math&gt; becomes zero because &lt;math&gt;t_e = t - t_l&lt;/math&gt;.

   when receive x-message(&lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, Time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
      if &lt;math&gt;( t_l \le t &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; t \le t_n )&lt;/math&gt; == false then
         error: bad synchronization;
      &lt;math&gt; s \leftarrow \delta_{ext}(s,t-t_l, x)&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_l \leftarrow t;&lt;/math&gt;
      &lt;math&gt; t_n \leftarrow t_l + ta(s); &lt;/math&gt;

==View 2: total states = states * lifespans * elapsed times==
Notice that as addressed in [[Behavior of Atomic DEVS]], depending on the value of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; return by &lt;math&gt; \delta_{ext}&lt;/math&gt;, last event time,&lt;math&gt;t_l&lt;/math&gt;, and next event time,&lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt;,consequently, elapsed time, &lt;math&gt;t_e&lt;/math&gt;, and lifespan&lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt;, are updated (if &lt;math&gt;b=1&lt;/math&gt;) or preserved (if &lt;math&gt;b=0&lt;/math&gt;).

   when receive x-message(&lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, Time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;)
      if &lt;math&gt;( t_l \le t &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; t \le t_n )&lt;/math&gt; == false then
         error: bad synchronization;
      &lt;math&gt; (s,b) \leftarrow \delta_{ext}(s, t-t_l, x)&lt;/math&gt;
      if &lt;math&gt; b = 1 &lt;/math&gt; then 
         &lt;math&gt; t_l \leftarrow t;&lt;/math&gt;
         &lt;math&gt; t_n \leftarrow t_l + ta(s); &lt;/math&gt;

'''Solo status''' is a [[social psychology]] term first popularized by Lord and Saenz (1985),&lt;ref&gt;Lord, C. G. &amp; Saenz, D. S. (1985). Memory deficits and memory surfeits: Differential cognitive consequences of tokenism for tokens and observers. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 49''(4), 918-926.&lt;/ref&gt; to classify the situation when only one member of a particular social category ([[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]], [[Ethnic group|culture]]) is present in a group setting. While the term has been used interchangeably with "[[Tokenism|token]]", solo status “does not imply that a person has been preferentially selected for a position by virtue of his or her social category”,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, M. &amp; Sekaquaptewa, D. (2002). When being different is detrimental: Solo status and the performance of women and racial minorities. ''Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, 2''(1), 184.&lt;/ref&gt; but is the singular representative based on mere chance or circumstance.

As the only member from the particular social category, individuals (especially women and [[Minority group|minorities]]) frequently feel a sense of responsibility to properly represent their entire category, with fear of not perpetuating a negative [[stereotype]]. This self-censoring places a greater strain on the individual’s [[Cognition|cognitive]] resources, leading to poorer performance on the task.&lt;ref&gt;Kiefer, A., Sekaquaptewa, D. &amp; Barczyk, A. (2006). When appearance concerns make women look bad: Solo status and body image concerns diminish women's academic performance. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 24'', 78-86&lt;/ref&gt; Solo status can impact a person’s performance even without the direct reference or relation to a stereotype, in spite of the person having equal or higher education or training than the remaining group.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, M. &amp; Sekaquaptewa, D. (2002). When being different is detrimental: Solo status and the performance of women and racial minorities. ''Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, 2''(1), 183-203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keller, J. &amp; Sekaquaptewa, D. (2008). Solo status and women's spatial test performance: The role of individuation tendencies. ''European Journal of Social Psychology, 38'', 1044-1053/ doi:10.1002/ejsp.490&lt;/ref&gt;

== Field vs laboratory results ==
The field of [[psychology]] is consistently confronted with the struggle of [[ecological validity]] and the applicability of their laboratory [[research]] in the real world. Due to the methods of testing solo status in both the field and the lab, psychologists understanding of solo status has evolved over time. Lord and Saenz (1985)&lt;ref&gt;Lord, C. G. &amp; Saenz, D. S. (1985). Memory deficits and memory surfeits: Differential cognitive consequences of tokenism for tokens and observers. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 49''(4), 918-926.&lt;/ref&gt; completed the first solo status experiment in a lab, where they claimed that solo status was equally detrimental to men and women on their cognitive performance. Unfortunately, these results did not align with Yoder's and Aniakudo's (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Yoder, J. D., &amp; Aniakudo, P. (1997). "Outsider within” the firehouse: Subordination and difference in the social interactions of African- American women. ''Gender &amp; Society'', 11, 324-341.&lt;/ref&gt; findings that women who experienced solo status in their offices were negatively affected in their job performances and productivity when compared to their male counterparts. Due to the discrepancies found in the research, Sekaquaptewa and Thompson (2002) &lt;ref&gt;Sekaquaptewa, D. &amp; Thompson, M. (2002). The differential effects of solo status on members of high- and low-status groups. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 28''(5), 694-707&lt;/ref&gt; compared the differences in methods and determined that laboratory studies focused on solo status’ impact on the [[learning]] task, while field studies focused on the task performance. The primary findings on the studies’ approach is explored below:

=== Laboratory Cases ===
Using Lord and Sanez (1985),&lt;ref&gt;Lord, C. G. &amp; Saenz, D. S. (1985). Memory deficits and memory surfeits: Differential cognitive consequences of tokenism for tokens and observers. ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]], 49''(4), 918-926.&lt;/ref&gt; as the primary case, participants were required to engage in a conversation with individuals online after receiving solo status during the learning phase. The article found that solo status individuals recalled less of the discussion, with the memory loss being justified by the participant splitting their [[attention]] between focusing on how they are portraying themselves and the material being learned. Lord and Sanez (1985),&lt;ref&gt;Lord, C. G. &amp; Saenz, D. S. (1985). Memory deficits and memory surfeits: Differential cognitive consequences of tokenism for tokens and observers. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 49''(4), 918-926.&lt;/ref&gt; found no difference between gender and race. These results were supported by Cohen and Swim (1995) &lt;ref&gt;Cohen, L. L., &amp; Swim, J. K. (1995). The differential impact of gender ratios on women and men: Tokenism, self-confidence, and expectations. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21'', 876-884.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stangor, Carr, and Kiang (1998)&lt;ref&gt;Stangor, C., Carr, C., &amp; Kiang, L. (1998). Activating stereotypes undermines task performance expectations. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 75'', 1191-1197.&lt;/ref&gt; who found a mirroring trend.

=== Field Cases ===
In field studies, individuals were reminded of their solo status during the performance task, where they become the sole focus of the group. In these studies, the individual had to speak in front of a group or engage in discussions. Based on these studies, a differing level of solo status has been demonstrated between [[Social status|high-status and low-status individuals]]. Low status individuals are often concerned that a negative performance will reflect poorly on their social category, while high status individuals do not share this concern.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, L. L., &amp; Swim, J. K. (1995). The differential impact of gender ratios on women and men: Tokenism, self-confidence, and expectations. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21'', 876-884.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stangor, C., Carr, C., &amp; Kiang, L. (1998). Activating stereotypes undermines task performance expectations. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 75'', 1191-1197.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on high-status individuals ==
In most cases, white males are classified as the high-status due to the [[Male privilege|privilege]] men receive in society. Due in part to this privilege, white males do not show any implications of solo status in field cases. In fact, Heikes (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Heikes, E. J. (1991). When men are the minority: The case of men in nursing. ''Sociological Quarterly, 32'', 389-401.&lt;/ref&gt; found that white male nurses who experienced solo status reported a positive experience and were privy to special treatment that frequently lead to an earlier promotion than their female counterparts.

== Impact on low-status individuals ==
In psychological studies, low-status individuals are represented by women or minorities (ethnic or race), who consistently perform worse in recall or when answering questions in group situations.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, M. &amp; Sekaquaptewa, D. (2002). When being different is detrimental: Solo status and the performance of women and racial minorities. ''Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, 2''(1), 183-203.&lt;/ref&gt; Kanter (1977) &lt;ref&gt;Kanter, R. M. (1977). Men and women of the corporation. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; found that observers remembered what solo status individuals’ stated better than nonsolos, and were [[Judgement|judged]] more critically than their majority counterparts. These critical judgments were worsened by the circumstance, as solo status is most frequently seen in contexts that impact the solo status individuals’ social and economic welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, M. &amp; Sekaquaptewa, D. (2002). When being different is detrimental: Solo status and the performance of women and racial minorities. ''Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, 2''(1), 183-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21996">In [[mathematics]], the '''tensor algebra''' of a [[vector space]] ''V'', denoted ''T''(''V'') or ''T''{{i sup|•}}(''V''), is the [[algebra over a field|algebra]] of [[tensor]]s on ''V'' (of any rank) with multiplication being the [[tensor product]]. It is the [[free algebra]] on ''V'', in the sense of being [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from algebras to vector spaces: it is the "most general" algebra containing ''V'', in the sense of the corresponding [[universal property]] (see [[#Adjunction and universal property|below]]).

The tensor algebra is important because many other algebras arise as [[quotient algebra]]s of ''T''(''V'').  These include the [[exterior algebra]], the [[symmetric algebra]], [[Clifford algebra]]s, the [[Weyl algebra]] and [[universal enveloping algebra]]s.

The tensor algebra also has two [[coalgebra]] structures; one simple one, which does not make it a bialgebra, but does lead to the concept of a [[cofree coalgebra]], and a more complicated one, which yields a [[bialgebra]], and can be extended by giving an antipode to create a [[Hopf algebra]] structure.

''Note'': In this article, all algebras are assumed to be [[unital algebra|unital]] and [[associative algebra|associative]]. The unit is explicitly required to define the coproduct.

==Construction==
Let ''V'' be a [[vector space]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K''. For any nonnegative [[integer]] ''k'', we define the '''''k''th tensor power''' of ''V'' to be the [[tensor product]] of ''V'' with itself ''k'' times:
:&lt;math&gt;T^kV = V^{\otimes k} = V\otimes V \otimes \cdots \otimes V.&lt;/math&gt;
That is, ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' consists of all tensors on ''V'' of [[tensor order|order]] ''k''. By convention ''T''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' is the [[ground field]] ''K'' (as a one-dimensional vector space over itself).

We then construct ''T''(''V'') as the [[direct sum of vector spaces|direct sum]] of ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' for ''k'' = 0,1,2,…
:&lt;math&gt;T(V)= \bigoplus_{k=0}^\infty T^kV = K\oplus V \oplus (V\otimes V) \oplus (V\otimes V\otimes V) \oplus \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
The multiplication in ''T''(''V'') is determined by the canonical isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;T^kV \otimes T^\ell V \to T^{k + \ell}V&lt;/math&gt;
given by the tensor product, which is then extended by linearity to all of ''T''(''V''). This multiplication rule implies that the tensor algebra ''T''(''V'') is naturally a [[graded algebra]] with ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' serving as the grade-''k'' subspace. This grading can be extended to a '''Z''' grading by appending subspaces &lt;math&gt;T^{k}V=\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; for negative integers ''k''.

The construction generalizes in straightforward manner to the tensor algebra of any [[module (mathematics)|module]] ''M'' over a [[commutative ring|''commutative'' ring]]. If ''R'' is a [[non-commutative ring]], one can still perform the construction for any ''R''-''R'' [[bimodule]] ''M''. (It does not work for ordinary ''R''-modules because the iterated tensor products cannot be formed.)

==Adjunction and universal property==
The tensor algebra ''T''(''V'') is also called the '''[[free algebra]]''' on the vector space ''V'', and is functorial. As with other [[free object|free constructions]], the functor ''T'' is [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] to some [[forgetful functor]]. In this case, it's the functor which sends each ''K''-algebra to its underlying vector space.

Explicitly, the tensor algebra satisfies the following [[universal property]], which formally expresses the statement that it is the most general algebra containing ''V'':
: Any [[linear transformation]] ''f'' : ''V'' &amp;rarr; ''A'' from ''V'' to an algebra ''A'' over ''K'' can be uniquely extended to an [[algebra homomorphism]] from ''T''(''V'') to ''A'' as indicated by the following [[commutative diagram]]:

[[Image:TensorAlgebra-01.png|center|Universal property of the tensor algebra]]

Here ''i'' is the [[Inclusion map|canonical inclusion]] of ''V'' into ''T''(''V'') (the unit of the adjunction). One can, in fact, define the tensor algebra ''T''(''V'') as the unique algebra satisfying this property (specifically, it is unique [[up to]] a unique isomorphism), but one must still prove that an object satisfying this property exists.

The above universal property shows that the construction of the tensor algebra is ''functorial'' in nature. That is, ''T'' is a [[functor]] from '''''K''-Vect''', the [[category of vector spaces]] over ''K'', to '''''K''-Alg''', the category of ''K''-algebras. The functoriality of ''T'' means that any linear map from ''V'' to ''W'' extends uniquely to an algebra homomorphism from ''T''(''V'') to ''T''(''W'').

==Non-commutative polynomials==
If ''V'' has finite dimension ''n'', another way of looking at the tensor algebra is as the "algebra of polynomials over ''K'' in ''n'' non-commuting variables". If we take [[basis vector]]s for ''V'', those become non-commuting variables (or [[Indeterminate (variable)|''indeterminates'']]) in ''T''(''V''), subject to no constraints beyond [[associativity]], the [[distributive law]] and ''K''-linearity.

Note that the algebra of polynomials on ''V'' is not &lt;math&gt;T(V)&lt;/math&gt;, but rather &lt;math&gt;T(V^*)&lt;/math&gt;: a (homogeneous) linear function on ''V'' is an element of &lt;math&gt;V^*,&lt;/math&gt; for example coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^1,\dots,x^n&lt;/math&gt; on a vector space are covectors, as they take in a vector and give out a scalar (the given coordinate of the vector).

==Quotients==

Because of the generality of the tensor algebra, many other algebras of interest can be constructed by starting with the tensor algebra and then imposing certain relations on the generators, i.e. by constructing certain [[quotient algebra]]s of ''T''(''V'').  Examples of this are the [[exterior algebra]], the [[symmetric algebra]], [[Clifford algebra]]s, the [[Weyl algebra]] and [[universal enveloping algebra]]s.

==Coalgebra==
The tensor algebra has two different [[coalgebra]] structures. One is compatible with the tensor product, and thus can be extended to a [[bialgebra]], and can be further be extended with an antipode to a [[Hopf algebra]] structure. The other structure, although simpler, cannot be extended to a bialgebra. The first structure is developed immediately below; the second structure is given in the section on the [[cofree coalgebra]], further down.

The development provided below can be equally well applied to the [[exterior algebra]], using the wedge symbol &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; in place of the tensor symbol &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;; a sign must also be kept track of, when permuting elements of the exterior algebra. This correspondence also lasts through the definition of the bialgebra, and on to the definition of a Hopf algebra. That is, the exterior algebra can also be given a Hopf algebra structure.

Similarly, the [[symmetric algebra]] can also be given the structure of a Hopf algebra, in exactly the same fashion, by replacing everywhere the tensor product &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; by the symmetrized tensor product &lt;math&gt;\otimes_\mathrm{Sym}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. that product where &lt;math&gt;v\otimes_\mathrm{Sym} w = w\otimes_\mathrm{Sym} v.&lt;/math&gt;

In each case, this is possible because the alternating product &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; and the symmetric product &lt;math&gt;\otimes_\mathrm{Sym}&lt;/math&gt; obey the required consistency conditions for the definition of a bialgebra and Hopf algebra; this can be explicitly checked in the manner below. Whenever one has a product obeying these consistency conditions, the construction goes thorough; insofar as such a product gave rise to a quotient space, the quotient space inherits the Hopf algebra structure.

In the language of [[category theory]], one says that there is a [[functor]] {{math|''T''}} from the category of {{math|''K''}}-vector spaces to the category of {{math|''K''}}-associate algebras. But there is also a functor {{math|''Λ''}} taking vector spaces to the category of exterior algebras, and a functor {{math|''Sym''}} taking vector spaces to symmetric algebras. There is a [[natural transformation|natural map]] from {{math|''T''}} to each of these. Verifying that quotienting preserves the Hopf algebra structure is the same as verifying that the maps are indeed natural.

=== Coproduct ===
The coalgebra is obtained by defining a [[coproduct]] or diagonal operator

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta: TV\to TV\boxtimes TV&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;TV&lt;/math&gt; is used as a short-hand for &lt;math&gt;T(V)&lt;/math&gt; to avoid an explosion of parenthesis. The &lt;math&gt;\boxtimes&lt;/math&gt; symbol is used to denote the "external" tensor product, needed for the definition of a coalgebra.  It is being used to distinguish it from the "internal" tensor product &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;, which is already "taken" and being used to denote multiplication in the tensor algebra (see the section ''Multiplication'', below, for further clarification on this issue). In order to avoid confusion between these two symbols, most texts will replace &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; by a plain dot, or even drop it altogether, with the understanding that it is implied from context. This then allows the otimes symbol to be used in place of the boxtimes symbol. This is not done below, and the two symbols are used independently and explicitly, so as to show the proper location of each.  The result is a bit more verbose, but should be easier to comprehend.

The definition of the operator &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is most easily built up in stages, first by defining it for elements &lt;math&gt;v\in V\subset TV&lt;/math&gt; and then by homomorphically extending it to the whole algebra.  A suitable choice for the coproduct is then

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta: v \mapsto v\boxtimes 1 + 1\boxtimes v&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta: 1 \mapsto 1 \boxtimes 1&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;1\in K=T^0V\subset TV&lt;/math&gt; is the unit of the field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. By linearity, one obviously has
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(k)=k(1\boxtimes 1)=k\boxtimes 1=1\boxtimes k&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;k\in K.&lt;/math&gt; It is straight-forward to verify that this definition satisfies the axioms of a coalgebra: that is, that
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{id}_{TV} \boxtimes \Delta) \circ \Delta = (\Delta \boxtimes \mathrm{id}_{TV}) \circ \Delta&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{id}_{TV}: x\mapsto x&lt;/math&gt; is the identity map on &lt;math&gt;TV&lt;/math&gt;.  Indeed, one gets
:&lt;math&gt;
((\mathrm{id}_{TV} \boxtimes \Delta) \circ \Delta)(v) =
v\boxtimes 1 \boxtimes 1 + 1\boxtimes v \boxtimes 1 + 1 \boxtimes 1 \boxtimes v
&lt;/math&gt;
and likewise for the other side. At this point, one could invoke a lemma, and say that &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; extends trivially, by linearity, to all of &lt;math&gt;TV&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;TV&lt;/math&gt; is a [[free object]] and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a [[generator (mathematics)|generator]] of the free algebra, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism. However, it is insightful to provide explicit expressions. So, for &lt;math&gt;v\otimes w \in T^2V&lt;/math&gt;, one has (by definition) the homomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta: v\otimes w \mapsto \Delta(v)\otimes \Delta(w)&lt;/math&gt;
Expanding, one has
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \Delta (v\otimes w) &amp;= (v\boxtimes 1 + 1\boxtimes v) \otimes (w\boxtimes 1 + 1\boxtimes w) \\
&amp;= (v\otimes w) \boxtimes 1 + v\boxtimes w +  w\boxtimes v + 1 \boxtimes (v\otimes w) \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In the above expansion, there is no need to ever write &lt;math&gt;1\otimes v&lt;/math&gt; as this is just plain-old scalar multiplication in the algebra; that is, one trivially has that &lt;math&gt;1\otimes v = 1\cdot v = v.&lt;/math&gt;

The extension above preserves the algebra grading. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta: T^2V \to \bigoplus_{k=0}^2 T^kV \boxtimes T^{(2-k)}V&lt;/math&gt;

Continuing in this fashion, one can obtain an explicit expression for the coproduct acting on a homogenous element of order ''m'':
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Delta(v_1\otimes\cdots\otimes v_m) &amp;=
\Delta(v_1)\otimes\cdots\otimes\Delta(v_m) \\
&amp;= \sum_{p=0}^m \left(v_0\otimes \cdots \otimes v_p\right) \;\omega
\; \left(v_{p+1}\otimes \cdots \otimes v_m\right) \\ 
&amp;= \sum_{p=0}^m \; \sum_{\sigma\in\mathrm{Sh}(p,m-p+1)} \;
\left(v_{\sigma(0)}\otimes\dots\otimes v_{\sigma(p)}\right) \boxtimes 
\left(v_{\sigma(p+1)}\otimes\dots\otimes v_{\sigma(m)}\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; symbol, which should appear as ш, the sha, denotes the [[shuffle product]]. This is expressed in the second summation, which is taken over all [[(p,q) shuffle|(p,m-p+1)-shuffles]].  The above is written with a notational trick, to keep track of the field element 1: the trick is to write &lt;math&gt;v_0=1&lt;/math&gt;, and this is shuffled into various locations during the expansion of the sum over shuffles.  The shuffle follows directly from the first axiom of a co-algebra: the relative order of the elements &lt;math&gt;v_k&lt;/math&gt; is ''preserved'' in the riffle shuffle: the riffle shuffle merely splits the ordered sequence into two ordered sequences, one on the left, and one on the right. Any one given shuffle obeys
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(0)&lt; \cdots &lt; \sigma(p)\quad\mbox{ and }\quad \sigma(p+1) &lt; \cdots &lt; \sigma(m)&lt;/math&gt;

As before, the algebra grading is preserved:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta: T^mV \to \bigoplus_{k=0}^m T^kV \boxtimes T^{(m-k)}V&lt;/math&gt;

===Counit===
The counit &lt;math&gt;\epsilon : TV \to K&lt;/math&gt; is given by the projection of the field component out from the algebra. This can be written as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon: v\mapsto 0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon: k\mapsto k &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k\in K=T^0V&lt;/math&gt;.  By homomorphism under the tensor product &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;, this extends to 
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon: x\mapsto 0 &lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;x\in T^1V \oplus T^2V\oplus \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
It is a straight-forward matter to verify that this counit satisfies the needed axiom for the coalgebra:
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{id} \boxtimes \epsilon) \circ \Delta = \mathrm{id} = (\epsilon \boxtimes \mathrm{id}) \circ \Delta.&lt;/math&gt;
Working this explicitly, one has
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
((\mathrm{id} \boxtimes \epsilon) \circ \Delta)(x)
&amp;=(\mathrm{id} \boxtimes \epsilon)(1\boxtimes x + x \boxtimes 1) \\
&amp;=1\boxtimes  \epsilon(x) + x \boxtimes  \epsilon(1) \\
&amp;=0 + x \boxtimes 1 \\
&amp;\cong x
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where, for the last step, one has made use of the isomorphism &lt;math&gt;TV\boxtimes K \cong TV&lt;/math&gt;, as is appropriate for the defining axiom of the counit.

== Bialgebra==
A [[bialgebra]] defines both multiplication, and comultiplication, and requires them to be compatible.

=== Multiplication ===
Multiplication is given by an operator
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla: TV\boxtimes TV\to TV&lt;/math&gt;
which, in this case, was already given as the "internal" tensor product. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla: x\boxtimes y\mapsto x \otimes y&lt;/math&gt;
That is, &lt;math&gt;\nabla(x\boxtimes y) = x \otimes y.&lt;/math&gt; The above should make it clear why the &lt;math&gt;\boxtimes&lt;/math&gt; symbol needs to be used: the &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; was actually one and the same thing as &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;; and notational sloppiness here would lead to utter chaos.  To strengthen this: the tensor product &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; of the tensor algebra corresponds to the multiplication &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; used in the definition of an algebra, whereas the tensor product &lt;math&gt;\boxtimes&lt;/math&gt; is the one required in the definition of comultiplication in a coalgebra.  These two tensor products are ''not'' the same thing!

=== Unit ===
The unit for the algebra
:&lt;math&gt;\eta: K\to TV&lt;/math&gt;
is just the embedding, so that
:&lt;math&gt;\eta: k\mapsto k&lt;/math&gt;
That the unit is compatible with the tensor product &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; is "trivial": it is just part of the standard definition of the tensor product of vector spaces.  That is, &lt;math&gt;k\otimes x = kx&lt;/math&gt; for field element ''k'' and any &lt;math&gt;x\in TV.&lt;/math&gt;  More verbosely, the axioms for an [[associative algebra]] require the two homomorphisms (or commuting diagrams):
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\circ(\eta \boxtimes\mathrm{id}_{TV}) = \eta\otimes \mathrm{id}_{TV} = \eta\cdot \mathrm{id}_{TV}&lt;/math&gt;
on &lt;math&gt;K\boxtimes TV&lt;/math&gt;, and that symmetrically, on &lt;math&gt;TV\boxtimes K&lt;/math&gt;, that
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\circ(\mathrm{id}_{TV}\boxtimes\eta) = \mathrm{id}_{TV}\otimes\eta = \mathrm{id}_{TV}\cdot\eta&lt;/math&gt;
where the right-hand side of these equations should be understood as the scalar product.

=== Compatibility ===
The unit and counit, and multiplication and comultiplication, all have to satisfy compatibility conditions. It is straightforward to see that 
:&lt;math&gt;\eta \circ \epsilon = \mathrm{id}_K.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the unit is compatible with comultiplication:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \circ \eta = \eta \boxtimes \eta \cong \eta&lt;/math&gt;
The above requires the use of the isomorphism &lt;math&gt;K\boxtimes K \cong K&lt;/math&gt; in order to work; without this, one loses linearity. Component-wise,
:&lt;math&gt;(\Delta \circ \eta)(k) = \Delta(k) = k(1 \boxtimes 1) \cong k \boxtimes k&lt;/math&gt;
with the right-hand side making use of the isomorphism.

Multiplication and the counit are compatible:
:&lt;math&gt;(\epsilon \circ \nabla)(x\boxtimes y) = \epsilon(x\otimes y) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
whenever ''x'' or ''y'' are not elements of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, and otherwise, one has scalar multiplication on the field: &lt;math&gt;k_1\otimes k_2=k_1 k_2.&lt;/math&gt;  The most difficult to verify is the compatibility of multiplication and comultiplication:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \circ\nabla = (\nabla \boxtimes \nabla) 
\circ (\mathrm{id} \boxtimes \tau \boxtimes \mathrm{id}) 
\circ (\Delta \boxtimes \Delta)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tau(x\boxtimes y)= y \boxtimes x&lt;/math&gt; exchanges elements. The compatibility condition only needs to be verified on &lt;math&gt;V\subset TV&lt;/math&gt;; the full compatibility follows as a homomorphic extension to all of &lt;math&gt;TV.&lt;/math&gt; The verification is verbose but straight-forward; it is not given here, except for the final result:
:&lt;math&gt;(\Delta \circ\nabla)(v\boxtimes w) = \Delta(v\otimes w)&lt;/math&gt;
For &lt;math&gt;v,w\in V,&lt;/math&gt; an explicit expression for this was given in the coalgebra section, above.

==Hopf algebra==
The [[Hopf algebra]] adds an antipode to the bialgebra axioms.  The antipode &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;k\in K=T^0V&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;S(k)=1&lt;/math&gt;
This is sometimes called the "anti-identity". The antipode on &lt;math&gt;v\in V=T^1V&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;S(v)=-v&lt;/math&gt;
and on &lt;math&gt;v \otimes w\in T^2V&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;S(v \otimes w) = S(w) \otimes S(v) = w\otimes v&lt;/math&gt;
This extends homomorphically to
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S(v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_m) 
&amp;= S(v_m) \otimes\cdots\otimes S(v_1) \\
&amp;= (-1)^m v_m \otimes\cdots\otimes v_1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Compatibility ===
Compatibility of the antipode with multiplication and comultiplication requires that
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \circ (S \boxtimes \mathrm{id}) \circ \Delta
= \eta \circ \epsilon
= \nabla \circ (\mathrm{id} \boxtimes S) \circ \Delta&lt;/math&gt;
This is straight-forward to verify componentwise on &lt;math&gt;k\in K&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(\nabla \circ (S \boxtimes \mathrm{id}) \circ \Delta)(k)
&amp;= (\nabla \circ (S \boxtimes \mathrm{id})) (k\boxtimes k) \\
&amp;= \nabla(1 \boxtimes k) \\
&amp;= 1 \otimes k \\
&amp;= k
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, on &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(\nabla \circ (S \boxtimes \mathrm{id}) \circ \Delta)(v)
&amp;= (\nabla \circ (S \boxtimes \mathrm{id})) (v\boxtimes 1 + 1 \boxtimes v) \\
&amp;= \nabla(-v \boxtimes 1 + 1 \boxtimes v) \\
&amp;= -v \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes v \\
&amp;= -v + v\\
&amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Recall that
:&lt;math&gt;(\eta \circ \epsilon)(k)=\eta(k)=k&lt;/math&gt;
and that 
:&lt;math&gt;(\eta \circ \epsilon)(x)=\eta(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;
for any &lt;math&gt;x\in TV&lt;/math&gt; that is ''not'' in &lt;math&gt;K.&lt;/math&gt;

One may proceed in a similar manner, by homomorphism, verifying that the antipode inserts the appropriate cancellative signs in the shuffle, starting with the compatibility condition on &lt;math&gt;T^2V&lt;/math&gt; and proceeding by induction.

==Cofree coalgebra==
{{main article|Cofree coalgebra}}
One may define a different coproduct on the tensor algebra, simpler than the one given above.  It is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(v_1 \otimes \dots \otimes v_k) := \sum_{j=0}^{k} (v_0 \otimes \dots \otimes v_j) \boxtimes (v_{j+1} \otimes \dots \otimes v_{k+1})&lt;/math&gt;

Here, as before, one uses the notational trick &lt;math&gt;v_0=v_{k+1}=1\in K&lt;/math&gt; (recalling that &lt;math&gt;v\otimes 1=v&lt;/math&gt; trivially).

This coproduct gives rise to a coalgebra. It describes a coalgebra that is [[duality (linear algebra)|dual]] to the algebra structure on ''T''(''V''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;), where ''V''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the [[dual vector space]] of linear maps ''V'' → '''F'''. In the same way that the tensor algebra is a [[free algebra]], the corresponding coalgebra is termed (conilpotent) co-free.  With the usual product this is not a bialgebra. It ''can'' be turned into a bialgebra with the product &lt;math&gt;v_i\cdot v_j=(i,j)v_{i+j}&lt;/math&gt; where ''(i,j)'' denotes the binomial coefficient for &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{i+j}{i}&lt;/math&gt;. This bialgebra is known as the [[divided power structure|divided power Hopf algebra]].

The difference between this, and the other coalgebra is most easily seen in the &lt;math&gt;T^2V&lt;/math&gt; term.  Here, one has that
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(v\otimes w) = 1\boxtimes (v\otimes w) + v \boxtimes w + (v\otimes w) \boxtimes 1&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;v,w\in V&lt;/math&gt;, which is clearly missing a shuffled term, as compared to before.

'''V-Day''', February 14, is a global activist movement to end [[violence against women]] and girls started by author, playwright and activist [[Eve Ensler]]. It has been co-ordinated by a [[501(c)(3)]] organization since 1998 which allows royalty-free performances of ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' to be held for charity every February 14. Ensler has been quoted as saying that it was women's reactions to the play that inspired her and her colleagues to launch V-Day. The 'V' in V-Day stands for Victory, Valentine and Vagina.

== About V-Day ==
In 1998, a non-profit charity, "V-Day", was incorporated with the intent of using performances of ''The Vagina Monologues'' to raise money to benefit female victims of violence and sexual abuse. Since its inception, the movement has expanded its use of art and activism to include screenings and reading — most notably of the documentary ''[[Until The Violence Stops]]'' (2004) and the compilation ''A Memory, Monologue, A Rant, and a Prayer''. Marches and festivals that have been held as part of the movement include UNTIL THE VIOLENCE STOPS: NYC (June 2006), and the ten-year anniversary V TO THE TENTH at the Louisiana Superdome and New Orleans Arena in 2008.

Beginning in early 2001, V-Day activities expanded to the international stage, with V-Day hosting leadership summits for women in Afghanistan and a gathering of activists in Rome. V-Day also launched the Karama program in the Middle East and coordinated community briefings on the missing and murdered women of Juarez, Mexico. In some societies where [[censorship]] forbids performances of ''The Vagina Monologues'', events revolve around other works developed by V-Day, including the book ''A Memory, a Monologue, a Rant, and a Prayer'', an anthology of writings about violence against women. V-Day included the first ever all [[transgender]] version of ''The Vagina Monologues'' in 2004, with a performance by eighteen notable [[transwomen]] under the mentoring of [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Andrea James]] of [[Deep Stealth Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deepstealth.com/vday/ |title=Deep Stealth and V-Day 2004 Performance of Vagina Monologues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent growth of the movement led to 5,400 events in 1,500 locations taking place in 2010 alone. It was then estimated that $80 million had been raised since the movement's inception with over 12,000 community-based anti-violence programs and safe houses in [[Democratic Republic of Congo|The Congo]], [[Haiti]], [[Kenya]], [[Egypt]] and [[Iraq]] receiving funding.

== Mission ==
According to its website, V-Day's vision is "''a world where women live safely and freely''."  They aim to tackle issues such as [[rape]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] of women, [[incest]], [[female genital mutilation]] and [[human trafficking]] of female sex slaves.

The organization seeks to strengthen existing anti-violence efforts by raising money and consciousness, and to lay the groundwork for new educational and protective legislative endeavours for women throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vday.org/contents/vday/aboutvday/mission |title=Mission |accessdate=2008-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515075252/http://www.vday.org/contents/vday/aboutvday/mission |archivedate=May 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; V-Day's work is grounded in four core beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vday.org/about/four-core-beliefs.html|title=Four Core Beliefs|publisher=V-Day|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stated as:

*Art has the power to transform thinking and inspire people to act. 
*Lasting social and cultural change is spread by ordinary people doing extraordinary things. 
*Local women best know what their communities need and can become unstoppable leaders. 
*One must look at the intersection of race, class, and gender to understand violence against women.

== V-Day campaigns ==
There are two types of V-Campaigns: The College Campaign and the Community Campaign.

Through these V-Day campaigns, local volunteers and college students produce annual benefit performances of ''The Vagina Monologues'', ''A Memory, A Monologue, A Rant and A Prayer'' and ''Any One of Us: Words From Prison''. They also offer screenings of the V-Day documentary ''Until The Violence Stops'' and the PBS documentary ''What I Want My Words to Do to You'', and conduct Spotlight Campaign Teach-Ins and V-Men workshops, to raise awareness and funds for anti-violence groups within their communities.

Each year V-Day spotlights a particular group of women who are experiencing violence with the goal of putting a worldwide media spotlight on this area and to raise funds to aide groups who are addressing it. For example, V-Day advocated for change throughout the Congo in 2007 by launching the ''Stop Raping Our Greatest Resource: Power To The Women and Girls of the Democratic Republic of Congo'' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vday.org/drc|title=City of Joy|publisher=V-Day|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 spotlight focused on the women and girls of Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vday.org/spotlight2011|title=2012 Women and Girls of Haiti|publisher=V-Day|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this year, the efforts in the Congo led to the opining of the survivors community [[City of Joy (city)|City of Joy]] in collaboration with Fondation Panzi and UNICEF. Located in Bukavu, the facilities provide 180 Congolese women per year with group therapy, self-defense training, sexuality education, ecology / horticulture education and cultural events.

With the support of Eve Ensler and the publicity from the V-Day campaign, [[One Billion Rising]], a global protest to end violence and promote justice and gender equality, was founded on February 14, 2012, the fifteenth V-Day. The name described a [[United Nations|UN]] and [[World Health Organization|WHO]] estimate for the number of women in the world who are likely to be raped or beaten at least once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/womens-blog/2013/dec/09/one-billion-rising-2014-campaign-end-violence-against-women-justice|title=One Billion Rising: The 2014 campaign to end violence against women|first=Eve|last=Ensler|publisher=The Guardian|date=2013-12-09|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project urges women and men to dance and rise up in opposition to violence. It has reached over 200 countries in regions such as North Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, with actions in each area dependent on local circumstances, traditions, and religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/05/25/happy-birthday-eve-ensler/|title=Happy Birthday Eve Ensler|publisher=Women In The World in association with The New York Times|date=2015-05-25|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feminist.com/violence/vday33.html|title=Until the Violence Stops: V-Day Launches One Billion Rising|publisher=V-Day Column|date=2012-02-14|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In the early 2000s, some right wing critics attacked V-Day for "hijacking the occasion of [[Valentine's Day]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/11/17/janus-forum-sexual-assault-event-sparks-controversy/|publisher=Brown Daily Herald|title=Janus Forum sexual assault event sparks controversy|first1=Camilla|last1=Brandfield-Harvey|first2=Caroline|last2=Kelly|date=2014-11-17|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conservative critics argued that feminists should not be admonishing people to consider rape, incest and violence on an occasion designed to celebrate love and romance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/728syqcj.asp|title=The V-Day Chronicles|publisher=The Weekly Standard|first=Rachel|last=DiCarlo|date=2004-02-12|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist feminist [[Wendy McElroy]] stated that "V-Day embodies the same double standard and dishonesty that has characterized most feminist pronouncements for decades" and urged people to "take back Valentines Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liberator.net/articles/McElroyWendy/takevd.html|title=Take Back Valentine's Day!|first=Wendy|last=McElroy|date=2002-02-15|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One critique came from Clara Eugenia Rojas in her 2005 publication "The ‘V-Day’ March in Mexico: Appropriation and Misuse of Local Women’s Activism."  Following the murders of the women in [[Juarez, Mexico]], V-Day became involved with this cause.  Rojas, a local feminist activist, noted that immediately following the discovery of the bodies, there was little that she nor anyone else could do to draw attention to the injustice and need for change.  After five years of local activists attempting to promote awareness about the violence, V-Day finally put a spotlight on the incident and made it a global issue.  Rojas, although grateful for the global exposure to the incident, believes that V-Day came too late to make much difference and that they were involved for the wrong reasons, i.e., publicity.  Rojas also critiques the movement for sidelining the local feminists who were originally attached to this incident and failing to include them in organization or implementation of the march.&lt;ref&gt;The ‘V-Day’March in Mexico: Appropriation and Misuse of Local Women’s Activism. "National Women’s Studies Association Journal" 17:217-227&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critique comes from the [[LGBT]] (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) community. In her article "Queerness, Disability, and The Vagina Monologues”, Kim Hall explained her dissatisfaction with the V-Day movement and more specifically ''The Vagina Monologues'' on an exclusionary basis.  Hall believes that the play excludes issues of violence against intersex individuals and perpetuates heterosexism and [[ableism]], or prejudice against people with disabilities. After this critique was published, many performances of ''The Vagina Monologues'' began advocating for the Intersex Society of North America by providing literature at the plays and urging the audience to donate.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Kim Q. 2005. “Queerness, Disability, and The Vagina Monologues.” Hypatia 20:100-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter "Wiley" Jones''' (July 14, 1841 &amp;ndash; December 7, 1904) was a [[business]]man in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]], [[Arkansas]], who was one of the wealthiest [[African-American]]s in his state. He owned the first [[streetcar]] company in Pine Bluff and a park in the city which housed the fairgrounds. A devotee of [[horse racing]], he owned stables and a race track on the park grounds. He also owned a saloon. He was active in civic affairs and was an advocate for [[civil rights]].

==Early life==
Walter "Wiley" Jones was born in [[Madison County, Georgia|Madison County]] in northeastern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], on July 14, 1848.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"&gt;Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell &amp; Company, 1887. p278-280&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were George Jones, a white planter, and Jones' [[Slavery|slave]], Anne,&lt;ref&gt;Gatewood, Willard B. "Frederick Douglass in Arkansas." ''[[The Arkansas Historical Quarterly]]'' 41, no. 4 (1982): 303-315.&lt;/ref&gt; who had six children by George Jones: Matthew (who superintended the construction of the Wiley Jones Street Car Line), Thomas, Julia (wife of Ben Reed), Wiley, Taylor, and James (who managed many of Wiley's businesses). Wiley received his nickname because of his mischievous nature. At the age of five, he moved to Arkansas with his master and more than forty fellow slaves. They settled on the Governor Byrd plantation. George Jones died in 1858. Anne was called his wife in an 1889 biography of Jones, and she believed that George had promised to free herself and her children upon his death, but no [[manumission]] papers were found, and the family was kept as slaves and sold by the estate administer, Peter Finerty, to [[James Yell]], a lawyer and planter in Pine Bluff. Jones worked as a houseboy and carriage driver for his new master. When Jones was ten, he was given to Yell's only son, [[Fountain Pitts Yell]], on the occasion of Pitts Yell's marriage. Pitts was a [[Arkansas House of Representatives|state representative]] from 1860 to 1861. During the [[American Civil War]], James Yell became a Major General of the Arkansas State Militia, and Pitts became a colonel in Company S of the [[26th Arkansas Infantry Regiment]] in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army. James Yell's was transferred to the Confederate States Army in the summer of 1861, and James left the service and moved to [[Texas]]. Jones served for Pitts during the war until Pitts' death in 1864 at the [[Battle of Pleasant Hill]] in [[Louisiana]]. Jones then joined James Yell and his family in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], Texas. There, he served as a porter in a mercantile house for one year. He was then hired to drive a wagon carrying cotton on a route along the [[Brazos River]] to [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]].&lt;ref name="Goodspeed1889"&gt;Goodspeed Publishing Company, Biographical and Historical Memoirs of Pulaski, Jefferson, Lonoke, Faulkner, Grant, Saline, Perry, Garland, and Hot Spring Counties, Arkansas Chicago, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business career ==

After the war, Jones returned to [[Monticello, Arkansas|Monticello]], Arkansas, with the Yell family. From there, he moved to Pine Bluff to work first as a mule driver and then as the business manager of the Yell plantation.&lt;ref name="Goodspeed1889"/&gt; In 1868,&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; he began to work as a [[barber]] in the shop of Ben Reed, his brother-in-law,&lt;ref name="Goodspeed1889"/&gt; and continued in that pursuit until 1881. He then began dealing [[tobacco]], [[cigar]]s, and other goods. His brother, James, worked as his plantation business manager.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; In 1884, Jones got the better of state legislator and pastor William Young in a fist fight in front of Jones's saloon as a result of Young giving a speech which Jones did not like.&lt;ref&gt;The Two Conventions About to Compromise - Summer Fights, Daily Arkansas Gazette (Little Rock, Arkansas) July 24, 1884, accessed September 22, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6737207//&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1886, Jones secured the charter for the first streetcar line in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. He had one and one-fourth mile completed and the first car running byn October 19, 1886, coinciding with the first day of the annual fair of the Colored Industrial and Fair Association, an organization of which he was treasurer. He owned the fair grounds located on a 55-acre park he owned near main street&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; and which was called Wiley Jones Park.&lt;ref name="Schweniger1997"&gt;Schweninger, Loren. Black property owners in the South, 1790-1915. Vol. 82. University of Illinois Press, 1997. p222-223.&lt;/ref&gt; His stables included one stallion, "Executor" that was of particular note, and later his colt, "Trickster". He also owned a number of mares and a herd of [[Shorthorn|Durham]] and [[Holstein cattle]].&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; In 1901, his thoroughbred pace, "Billy H", broke a track record at a race in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor, Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Pine Bluff Personals, Arkansas Democrat (Little Rock, Arkansas) July 19, 1901, page 3, accessed September 22, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6737461/pine_bluff_personals_arkansas_democrat/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, he purchased the second line in Pine Bluff, known as the Citizen's line, from H. P. Bradford for $125,000.&lt;ref&gt;A Big Deal, Daily Arkansas Gazette (Little Rock, Arkansas), November 25, 1890, page 3, accessed September 22, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6737328/a_big_deal_daily_arkansas_gazette/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, Jones sold his streetcar company to another streetcar syndicate.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, John William. "Jim Crow in Arkansas: A Reconsideration of Urban Race Relations in the Post-Reconstruction South." The Journal of Southern History 55, no. 3 (1989): 421-448.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, Jones founded the Southern Mercantile Company, making his longtime friend Fred Havis president and his brother, James, manager.&lt;ref name="Leslie1978"/&gt;

{{Main|Women's liberation movement}}

The '''[[women's liberation movement]] in Oceania''' was a [[Radical feminism|feminist]] movement that started in the late 1960s and continued through the early 1980s. Influenced by the movement which sought to make personal issues political and bring discussion of [[sexism]] into the political discourse in the United States and elsewhere, women in Australia and New Zealand began forming WLM groups in 1969 and 1970. Few organisations formed in the [[Pacific Islands]], but both Fiji and Guam had women affiliated with the movement.

Quickly adherents spread throughout Australia and New Zealand. Their primary issue was autonomy for women in all spheres of life, including focus on child care centers, equal opportunity for and pay and employment, objectification of women, reproductive rights, sexuality and sexual abuse. Most importantly, they wanted a fundamental change in the way society perceived women. Rejecting that reforming existing laws would change women's place in society without an accompanying change in the thoughts about women, liberationists participated in public protests, published information on issues, and held meetings to organise lobbying efforts.

In 1969, [[Martha Ansara]], who had relocated after a divorce from the United States that year to [[Sydney]], joined with [[Margaret Eliot (feminist) |Margaret Eliot]], [[Sandra Hawker]], and [[Coonie Sandford]] to form a discussion group about materials on the Women's Liberation Movement that she had brought from the States. They decided to host a meeting on the topic and prepared a pamphlet ''Only the Chains Have Changed'' to announce the January 1970 meeting.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|pp=25–26}} That same year, Warren Osmond, a tutor at the [[University of Adelaide]] had read about the protest over the Miss America Pageant and wrote an article in ''[[On Dit]]'', the student newspaper drawing parallels with the university's "Miss Fresher" Pageant. In March 1970, a group of Adelaide Women's Liberation adherents picketed the contest.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=26}} By May, the first nationwide conference on Women's Liberation, profiling "Female Conditioning" was organised in Melbourne, spreading the movement quickly across Australia.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=27}}{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=103}}

After police raided the Heatherbrae Clinic, an abortion referral facility in 1970, the Sydney Women's Liberation group organised a protest in July and wrote about it in their newsletter. Throughout the September trial, they demonstrated at the court, advocating for legal abortion. The WLM organised a motorcade and petition drive for abortion in October. In January 1971, the Gay Liberation affiliate of the Sydney WLM was formed.{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=103}} Hungry for information on the theory and philosophy of the movement, such texts as, ''[[The Female Eunuch]]'' (1970) by [[Germaine Greer]], an Australian-born woman living in Britain;{{sfn|Magarey|2014b}} ''[[Sexual Politics]]'' (1970) by American [[Kate Millett]]; ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'' (1970) by Canadian-American [[Shulamith Firestone]]; and ''[[Woman's Estate]]'' (1971) by British [[Juliet Mitchell]] became widely read and discussed.{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=106}} The mixture of texts from various countries as well as from different political backgrounds resulted in a commitment to collectivity and divergent ideas on how issues which involved women should be addressed.{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=106}} 

Initially, men participated in the WLM in Australia, but in the period between 1970 and 1971, women began to oust men from their organisations because they tended to dominate the narrative and inform the women participants of how they should proceed.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|pp=27–28}} One of the earliest journals, ''MeJane'', produced by the MeJane Collective of Sydney was founded in 1971 and produced by women like [[Suzanne Bellamy]] and [[Joyce Stevens]].{{sfn|Henderson|Bartlett|2014|pp=105–108}} As in the US and other places where the movement flourished, small groups of consciousness-raising with a limited organisational structure were the norm{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|pp=29–30}} and the focus was on changing societal perception rather than legislation.{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}} Prominent in the movement were women like [[Eva Cox]], who would become a professor and social commentator; Justice [[Elizabeth Evatt]], first chief justice of the [[Family Court of Australia]];{{sfn|Magarey|2014b}} [[Eileen Haley]] of Adelaide; [[Anne Summers]],{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=30}} who would write ''Damned Whores and God's Police'' in 1975, which became widely influential;{{sfn|Arrow|2015}}{{sfn|Magarey|2014b}} [[Pat Turner (Aboriginal activist)|Pat Turner]], an aboriginal activist and civil servant;{{sfn|Henningham|2012}} and [[Biff Ward]], a writer and social activist.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=30}} 

In 1972, the Melbourne Women's Liberation set up a center at 16 Little La Trobe Street which became a gathering place for members of the movement. They produced the ''Women's Liberation Newsletter'' on a [[gestetner]] and provided a community referral service to women.{{sfn|Henderson|Bartlett|2014|pp=91–92}} In the run-up to the elections that year, two of the WLM groups in Melbourne met to strategise over the federal candidates who might be favorable to women's issues. Out of these strategy sessions, the [[Women's Electoral Lobby]] (WEL) was founded and began lobbying the [[Australian Labour Party]] to address their concerns.{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=110}} When Labour won, with [[Gough Whitlam]] being elected [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], WEL began lobbying for fulfillment of the promises made in exchange for their support. Whitlam appointed [[Elizabeth Anne Reid|Elizabeth Reid]] as an advisor on women's affairs. The reaction from other liberationists was clear, when a statement was issued in ''MeJane'' denouncing not only the illegitimacy of a man choosing a woman to be a spokesperson for women, but of choosing a single person to represent diverse points of view.{{sfn|Genovese|1998|pp=110–111}} From that point, there was a fissure in the relationship of WLM and WEL.{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}}

Two groups formed in Tasmania in the early 1970s both from the women at the [[University of Tasmania]]. The Tasmanian University Union Women's Liberation group formed in 1971 and as one of their main initiatives worked to establish a much-needed Child Care Center for students on campus.{{sfn|Pearce|2017}} The other group, the Hobart Women's Action Group (HWAG) formed in 1972 with members like Kay Daniels and her partner Shirley Castley. That same year they founded the widely-read journal ''Liberaction''.{{sfn|Pearce|2017}}{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=44}} ''Liberaction'' was intellectual but simultaneously irreverent and brought a different spin to WLM literature being produced in Australia. One example of the type of article it produced was their "Feminist Food Guide", which took on the stereotypes of women dining out without male companions. Public perception held that women without male escorts were not only not respectable, but incapable of ordering a meal or critiquing it. The members of HWAG visited various restaurants evaluating the atmosphere, the service, the prices and the food, reporting on their experiences.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|pp=50–52}} To those who complained that food was not a feminist issue, HWAG commented that they were missing the point{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=54}} that they were a group of women, dining out without children or men, had income and control of their own finances and were able to evaluate their treatment by businesses on their own.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=51}}

In 1974, the [[Elsie Refuge]], Australia's first [[women's shelter]] was established by Carole Baker, Jennifer Dakers, Anne Summers and other Sydney WLM activists. Influenced by [[Erin Pizzey]]'s book ''Scream Quietly or the Neighbours Will Hear'', they approached the Church of England in [[Glebe]], which owned many unoccupied properties in search of a suitable dwelling.{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=128}} When the church failed to respond, the activists selected two derelict houses on Westmoreland Street in Glebe and asserted [[squatter's rights]] over the properties after they had renovated them to make them habitable and opened to women and their children.{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=131}} Sybylla Press was established in 1976{{sfn|Henderson|Bartlett|2014|p=93}} and published all the feminist tracts of the WLM of Victoria including ''Lesbian News'', ''Scarlet Woman'' and ''Vashti'', among others, until it ceased operations in 1988.{{sfn|Henderson|Bartlett|2014|p=95}} That same year, the WLM of Canberra reported that in the six years since their group was formed they had established a meeting house; developed a Women's Centre on Lobelia Street which provided a referral service, abortion counseling and bookstore; a refuge house; and rape crisis center.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=57}}

Though WLM groups were still functioning in 1979, factionalism in the [[Feminism in Australia|women's movement]] and a perception by society at large that they were anti-male, had caused liberationists to withdraw from public demonstration to focus on issues such as education, family law, reproductive rights and employment discrimination.{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}}

=== Sydney ===
The [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] (WLM) in [[Sydney]] began in 1969 with small meetings of women in [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] and [[Glebe, Sydney|Glebe]], as part of the explosive development of Women's Liberation politics and organisation that occurred internationally from the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s.{{sfn|Allan|1999}}

Talking to each other about experiences previously regarded as belonging only in the domain of 'private life' — such as rape, domestic violence, incest, and abortion — gatherings of women at 67 Glebe Point Road and very soon elsewhere, discovered the commonality of these experiences. These collective conversations about such previously taboo subjects became known as 'Consciousness-raising' and one of the key political differences between older forms of political organising and the new liberation movement. The understanding of women's experiences as universal and systemic, rather than individual and idiosyncratic, became summarised as 'The Personal is Political' and one of the key insights of the Women's Liberation Movement.{{sfn|Bellamy|1987|p=189}}

== New Zealand ==
Influenced by the developments in the United States and Britain, women's liberation groups began to form in [[Wellington]] and [[Auckland]] in 1970,{{sfn|Cook|2011}} when Therese O'Connell started the Women's Liberation Front Club at [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]] and Women for Equality emerged in Auckland. Some of their first actions were to invade the "males only" Bistro Bar at the Great Northern Hotel and demonstrate at the Miss New Zealand Beauty Pageant.{{sfn|Else|1993|p=63}}{{sfn|Schmidt|2016|p=198}} Membership grew quickly, expanding to [[Dunedin]], [[Christchurch]] and other areas in [[New Zealand]]. Subjects which had previously not been viewed as political, such as childcare, health, housework, and sexuality, became part of public debate as a result of the movement's drive to recognise that the "personal is political".{{sfn|Cook|2011}} In response to Women's Liberation demands, the government of New Zealand established the [[Society for Research on Women (SROW)]] in 1970 and hosted series of United Women's Conventions, which covered issues such as [[violence against women]], women's health and abortion.{{sfn|Ministry for Women|2016}} This confirmed that the influence of the movement extended beyond those actively engaged in the WLM, as their aims were not to reform laws and make a place for women in society, but rather create fundamental change in the way women were perceived and society was organised.{{sfn|Cook|2011}}{{sfn|Else|1993|p=65}}

In 1971, [[Ngahuia Te Awekotuku]] ([[Te Arawa]]-[[Tūhoe]]) and [[Sue Kedgley]] participated in a protest with other women from the [[University of Auckland]], in [[Albert Park, Auckland|Albert Park]], to demonstrate the lack of progress for women with a mock [[funeral procession]]. Attracting wide media attention, the women were mocked but the coverage sparked a surge of interest and encouraged many women to become involved.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018a}}{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018b}} The Dunedin Collective for Woman formed in 1971 focusing on the issues of change in society's perception of women, access to child care, equal pay, and women's authority over their own bodies. The group functioned as an [[umbrella organization|umbrella organisation]] for WLM groups around [[Dunedin]] to develop [[Consciousness raising|consciousness-raising]] cells, network with other groups, participate in collective protests, and produce materials on women's issues.{{sfn|Else|1993|p=96}} Liberationists avoided hierarchical organisation striving for consensus among the membership,{{sfn|Cook|2011}} which was inclusive of all women. Adopting the "sisterhood is powerful" concept that all women were united in their oppression as women, liberationists membership included students, housewives, working women, as well as lesbians, [[Māori people|Māori women]] and other Pacific Islanders.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018a}} The broad spectrum of members created divisions and fissures began to erupt between [[socialist feminists]], [[liberal feminists]] and liberationists.{{sfn|Cook|2011}}

In 1972, Kedgley published along with Sharyn Cederman ''Sexist Society'', which examined the stereotypes of men and women's roles in society and marked her exit from liberationist ideals.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018b}}{{sfn|Pool|Du Plessis|2011}} That same year, [[Connie Purdue]] assisted in organising a New Zealand tour by [[Germaine Greer]], a noted feminist from Australia.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018c}} Te Awekotuku and other liberationists protested Greer's appearance, dressing as witches and calling attention to the exclusion of indigenous people, lesbians and undesirables from her welcome.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018a}} Purdue's response was that Te Awekotuku had "set the movement back 50 years".{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018a}} Kedgley and Purdue, then turned away from radical ideals and formed the National Organisation for Women, based on the United States organisation and begin working on reform policies.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018c}} In Wellington, the first National Women's Liberation Conference was held in April 1972. Attended by over 500 women and men, the agenda discussed equal opportunities in education and employment, lesbian and reproductive rights, childcare support and the launch of women's studies programmes in university.{{sfn|Else|1993|p=64}} That same year, [[Anne Else]] co-founded ''[[Broadsheet (magazine)|Broadsheet]]'' with [[Sandra Coney]], which would become the most prominent feminist journal in New Zealand.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018d}} Among its editors were Coney, [[Claire-Louise McCurdy]], and [[Pat Rosier]].{{sfn|Cook|2011}}{{sfn|Auckland Museum|n.d.}}
 
As many members had children, quality child care was an issue and a focus of liberationist groups was to establish centers where women could meet and childcare was provided. The establishment in 1974 in Dundin of women's center which shared space for a pre-school was typical. Liberationists also established bookstores and [[women's shelter]]s to provide refuge for women in abusive situations.{{sfn|Else|1993|pp=96–97}} When they began, shelters in New Zealand created a "'parallel development' model that involved sharing power between [[Māori people|Māori]] and ‘''tauiwi''’ (all people who arrived after Māori) in decision-making, use of funds, public presentations and staffing",{{sfn|Cook|2011}} but by 1973, Māori and lesbian groups began to separate themselves to focus on their different issues.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018a}} One of these groups, first formed in Christchurch, was [[Sisters for Homophile Equality]] (SHE) which aimed to politicise the issues faced by women and [[gay liberation]]ists. Because their issues had differences from mainstream WLM and from the men in the LGBT movement, ''SHE'' focused on the dual discrimination faced by its members. The organisation soon spread to Wellington, where the magazine ''[[Lesbian Feminist Circle|The Circle]]'' was founded to allow lesbians from throughout the country to network and share ideas.{{sfn|Else|1993|p=559}}

Radical feminist caucuses were held beginning in 1975 and fostered the development of a network which met between 1976 and 1978.{{sfn|Else|1993|p=65}} The last three-day conference on the subject of women's liberation took place in Auckland in February 1978 and highlighted the various types of feminist views ranging from anarchy and socialism to racism and lesbianism. Some exchanges grew heated over whether women's oppression stemmed from class differences, racial differences, social differences, a combination of several issues, or were systemic.{{sfn|Rogers|1978}} The divisions pointed to fractures which would eventually split [[Feminism in New Zealand|feminists]] into groups focusing on specific interests.{{sfn|Cook|2011}} Liberationists continued to operate in New Zealand into the early 1980s, but as its early members moved on to other commitments, groups dispersed.{{sfn|Else|1993|pp=97, 554}}

==Pacific Islands==
In general, many women from the Pacific Islands, which includes some 20,000 islands lying between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn]]{{sfn|Morgan|1984|p=515}} did not identify with feminism which they thought of as a "[[Western philosophy]]", as in their cultures, women had defined positions of power.{{sfn|Griffen|Yee|1987|p=1}} Women in the era often identified with the [[decolonialisation]] movement and saw their oppression in terms of having been colonised.{{sfn|Morgan|1984|p=515}} Pockets of groups affiliated with Women's Liberation appeared in the region, such as a group which formed in [[Fiji]], at the [[University of the South Pacific]] in 1971{{sfn|Griffen|Yee|1987|p=1}} and a cooperative ''Guam Women Unite'' formed that same year in [[Guam]].{{sfn|''The Ladder''|1972|p=47}}

'''Yoko Ono''' ({{lang-ja|小野 洋子|Ono Yōko}}, &lt;small&gt;usually spelled in [[katakana]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|ja|オノ・ヨーコ}}; born February 18, 1933) is a Japanese [[multimedia artist]], [[singer]], [[songwriter]], and [[Peace movement|peace activist]] who is also known for her work in [[performance art]] and [[filmmaking]].&lt;ref name="my.entertainment.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://my.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/yoko-ono-retrospective-opens-frankfurt-164740038.html|title=Yoko Ono retrospective opens in Frankfurt|date=February 16, 2013|publisher=Yahoo Malaysia|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912052307/http://my.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/yoko-ono-retrospective-opens-frankfurt-164740038.html|archivedate=September 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She performs in both [[English language|English]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. She is known for having been the second wife of [[singer-songwriter]] [[John Lennon]] of [[the Beatles]].

Ono grew up in [[Tokyo]] and also spent several years in [[New York City]]. She studied at Gakushuin University, but withdrew from her course after two years and moved to New York in 1953 to live with her family. She spent some time at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] and then became involved in [[New York City]]'s [[downtown]] artists scene, which included the [[Fluxus]] group. She first met Lennon in 1966 at her own [[art exhibition]] in [[London]], and they became a [[Couple (relationship)|couple]] in 1968 and wed the following year. With their [[Performance art|performance]] [[Bed-In|''Bed-Ins for Peace'']] in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Montreal]] in 1969, Ono and Lennon famously used their [[honeymoon]] at the [[Hilton Amsterdam]] as a stage for public [[protests against the Vietnam War]]. The [[feminism|feminist]] themes of her music have influenced musicians as diverse as the [[B-52s]] and [[Meredith Monk]]. She achieved commercial and critical acclaim in 1980 with the chart-topping album ''[[Double Fantasy]]'', a collaboration with Lennon that was released three weeks before [[Murder of John Lennon|his murder]].

[[File:Yoko Ono 4 - Echo of Moscow.jpg|thumb|Ono at a conference, 2007]]
Public appreciation of Ono's work has shifted over time and was helped by a [[retrospective]] at a [[Whitney Museum]] branch in 1989 and the 1992 release of the six-disc [[box set]] ''[[Onobox]].'' Retrospectives of her artwork have also been presented at the [[Japan Society (Manhattan)|Japan Society]] in [[New York City]] in 2001, in [[Bielefeld]], Germany, and the UK in 2008, [[Frankfurt]], and [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]], in 2013 and [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City in 2015. She received a [[Golden Lion Award]] for lifetime achievement from the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2009 and the 2012 [[Oskar Kokoschka]] Prize, Austria's highest award for applied contemporary art.

As Lennon's widow, Ono works to preserve his legacy. She funded [[Strawberry Fields memorial|Strawberry Fields]] in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Central Park]], the [[Imagine Peace Tower]] in [[Iceland]], and the [[John Lennon Museum]] in [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama]], Japan (which closed in 2010). She has made significant philanthropic contributions to the arts, [[peace]], [[Philippines|Philippine]] and Japan disaster relief, and other causes. In 2012 Ono received the Dr. Rainer [[Alexandra Hildebrandt|Hildebrandt]] Human Rights Award. The award is given annually in recognition of extraordinary, nonviolent commitment to [[human rights]]. Ono continued her social activism when she inaugurated a biennial $50,000 [[LennonOno Grant for Peace]] in 2002.  She also co-founded the group [[Artists Against Fracking]] in 2012. She has a daughter, Kyoko Chan Cox, from her marriage to Anthony Cox and a son, [[Sean Taro Ono Lennon]], from her marriage to Lennon. She collaborates musically with Sean.

==Early life and family==
Ono was born on February 18, 1933, in [[Tokyo|Tokyo, Japan]], to {{nihongo|Isoko Ono|小野 磯子|Ono Isoko}} and {{nihongo|Eisuke Ono|小野 英輔|Ono Eisuke}}, a wealthy banker and former [[classical pianist]].&lt;ref name="allmusicB"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yoko-ono-mn0000521704/biography|title=Yoko Ono: biography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=February 1, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130101749/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yoko-ono-mn0000521704/biography|archivedate=January 30, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isoko's maternal grandfather {{nihongo|[[Zenjiro Yasuda]]|安田 善次郎|Yasuda Zenjirō}} was an affiliate of the [[Yasuda clan]] and [[Yasuda zaibatsu|zaibatsu]]. Eisuke came from a long line of [[samurai]] warrior-scholars.&lt;ref name=Stan/&gt; The [[kanji]] translation of [[Yoko (name)|''Yōko'']] ({{lang|ja|洋子}}) means "ocean child".&lt;ref name="allmusicB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nme/&gt;

Two weeks before Ono's birth, Eisuke was transferred to [[San Francisco]] by his employer, the [[Yokohama Specie Bank]].&lt;ref name="sayle"/&gt; The rest of the family followed soon after, with Ono meeting her father when she was two.&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yoko Ono - Charts &amp; Awards - Billboard Singles|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yoko-ono-p19685/charts-awards/billboard-singles|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her younger brother Keisuke was born in December 1936. Ono was enrolled in [[piano lesson]]s from the age of 4.&lt;ref name=MH231&gt;{{harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, the family was transferred back to Japan and Ono enrolled at Tokyo's elite [[Gakushuin]] (also known as the Peers School), one of the most exclusive schools in Japan.&lt;ref name="sayle"/&gt;

The family moved to [[New York City]] in 1940. The next year, Eisuke was transferred from New York City to [[Hanoi]], and the family returned to Japan. Ono was enrolled in Keimei Gakuen, an exclusive Christian [[primary school]] run by the [[Mitsui]] family. She remained in Tokyo throughout [[World War II]] and the great [[Bombing of Tokyo|fire-bombing of March 9, 1945]], during which she was sheltered with other family members in a special [[bunker]] in Tokyo's [[Azabu]] district, away from the heavy bombing. Ono later went to the [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] [[mountain resort]] with members of her family.&lt;ref name="sayle"/&gt;

Starvation was rampant in the destruction that followed the Tokyo bombings; the Ono family was forced to beg for food while pulling their belongings with them in a wheelchair. Ono said it was during this period in her life that she developed her "aggressive" attitude and understanding of "outsider" status. Other stories tell of her mother bringing a large number of goods with them to the countryside, where they were [[barter]]ed for food. In one anecdote, her mother traded a German-made [[sewing machine]] for {{convert|60|kg}} of rice to feed the family.&lt;ref name="sayle"/&gt; During this time, Ono's father, who had been in Hanoi, was believed to be in a [[POW camp|prisoner of war camp]] in [[China]]. However, unbeknownst to them, he remained in the city. Ono told [[Amy Goodman]] of ''[[Democracy Now]]'' on October 16, 2007, that "He was in [[French Indochina]], which is [[Vietnam]] actually.... in Saigon. He was in a concentration camp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/10/16/exclusive_yoko_ono_on_the_new|title=EXCLUSIVE: Yoko Ono on the New Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland, Art &amp; Politics, the Peace Movement, Government Surveillance and the Murder of John Lennon|last=Goodman|first=Amy|date=October 16, 2007|work=[[Democracy Now!]]|accessdate=February 25, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222184454/http://www.democracynow.org/2007/10/16/exclusive_yoko_ono_on_the_new|archivedate=February 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 1946, Gakushuin was reopened and Ono re-enrolled. The school, located near the [[Kōkyo|Tokyo Imperial Palace]], had not been damaged by the war, and Ono found herself a classmate of [[Akihito|Prince Akihito]], the future [[emperor of Japan]].&lt;ref name="allmusicB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stan/&gt; She graduated in 1951 and was accepted into the [[philosophy]] program of [[Gakushuin University]] as the first woman to enter the department. However, she left the school after two semesters.&lt;ref name="sayle"&gt;Murray Sayle, [http://www.jpri.org/publications/occasionalpapers/op18.html "The Importance of Yoko Ono"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221150020/http://www.jpri.org/publications/occasionalpapers/op18.html |date=December 21, 2007 }}, JPRI Occasional Paper No. 18, Japan Policy Research Institute, November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York City==

===College and downtown beginnings===
After the war ended in 1945, Ono remained in Japan when her family moved to the [[United States]] and settled in [[Scarsdale, New York]], an affluent town 25 miles north of [[midtown Manhattan]]. When Ono later rejoined her family, she enrolled at nearby [[Sarah Lawrence College]]. Ono's parents approved of her college choice but she said that they disapproved of her lifestyle and chastised her for befriending people that they felt were beneath her. In spite of her parents' disapproval, Ono loved meeting artists, [[poet]]s, and others who represented the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle to which she aspired. She visited [[Art galleries|galleries]] and art [[happening]]s in the city; this whetted her desire to publicly display her own artistic endeavors. [[American People|American]] [[avant-garde]] artist, [[composer]], and musician [[La Monte Young]] was her first important contact in the New York art world; he helped Ono start her career by using her [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] loft in [[Tribeca]] as a performance space. After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, her [[mentor]] [[John Cage]] advised her to treat the paper with [[flame retardant]].&lt;ref name=Stan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/january7/yoko-010709.html|title=Yoko Ono to speak at Stanford, Stanford Report|last=Haven|first=Cynthia|date=December 19, 2008|publisher=Stanford University|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112012256/http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/january7/yoko-010709.html|archivedate=November 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Japan, early career, and motherhood===
In 1956, Ono left college to [[elope]] with Japanese composer [[Toshi Ichiyanagi]],&lt;ref name=Stan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.biography.com/people/yoko-ono-9542162|title=Yoko Ono|publisher=biography.com|accessdate=February 14, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216080529/http://www.biography.com/people/yoko-ono-9542162|archivedate=February 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; a star in Tokyo's experimental community.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=23}} After living apart for several years, they filed for [[divorce]] in 1962. Ono returned home to live with her parents and was suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] when she was briefly placed into a Japanese [[mental institution]].&lt;ref name="allmusicB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BioChannel&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono.html|title=Yoko Ono Biography|publisher=Biography Channel (UK)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213213142/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono.html|archivedate=December 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, on November 28, 1962, Ono married [[Anthony Cox (producer)|Anthony Cox]], an American [[jazz musician]], [[film producer]], and art promoter, who was instrumental in securing her release from the institution.&lt;ref name=Stan/&gt; Ono's second marriage was [[annullment|annulled]] on March 1, 1963, because she had neglected to finalize her divorce from Ichiyanagi. After finalizing that divorce, Cox and Ono married again on June 6, 1963. She gave birth to their daughter Kyoko Chan Cox two months later on August 8, 1963.&lt;ref name="allmusicB"/&gt;

The marriage quickly fell apart, but the Coxes stayed together for the sake of their joint [[career]]s. They performed at Tokyo's [[Sogetsu]] Hall, with Ono lying atop a piano played by John Cage. Soon, the couple returned to New York with Kyoko. In the early years of the marriage, Ono left most of Kyoko's parenting to Cox while she pursued her art full-time, with Cox also managing her [[publicity]]. Ono and Cox divorced on February 2, 1969, and she married John Lennon later that same year. In the midst of a 1971 [[custody battle]], Cox disappeared with their eight-year-old daughter. He won custody after successfully claiming that Ono was an unfit mother due to her drug use.&lt;ref name=BioChannel/&gt; Ono's ex-husband changed Kyoko's name to "Ruth Holman" and subsequently raised the girl in an organization known as the [[The Living Word Fellowship|Church of the Living Word]] (or "the Walk").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hockinson|first=Michael J.|title=The Ultimate Beatles Quiz Book|date=1992|publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ono and Lennon searched for Kyoko for years, but to no avail. She finally saw Kyoko again many years later in 1998.&lt;ref name=BioChannel/&gt;

==John Lennon==
[[Fluxus]], a loose association of [[Dada]]-inspired [[avant-garde]] artists that developed in the early 1960s, was active in New York and Europe.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=27}} Ono visited London to meet artist and political activist [[Gustav Metzger]]'s Destruction in Art Symposium in September 1966, as the only woman artist chosen to perform her own events and only one of two invited to speak.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=168}}

There are two versions of the story of how Lennon and Ono first met. According to the first account, on November 9, 1966 Lennon went to the [[Indica Gallery]] in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit, and they were introduced by gallery owner [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]].{{sfn|Harry|2001|p=682}} Lennon was initially unimpressed with the exhibits he saw, including a pricey bag of nails, but one piece, ''[[Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting]]'', had a ladder with a spyglass at the top. When he climbed the ladder, Lennon felt a little foolish, but he looked through the spyglass and saw the word "YES" which he said meant he didn't walk out, as it was positive, whereas most concept art he encountered was "anti" everything.&lt;ref name=HSW&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/john-lennon30.htm|title=John Lennon: John Lennon Meets Yoko Ono|last=Buskin|first=Richard|publisher=HowStuffWorks.com|accessdate=April 17, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427092641/http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/john-lennon30.htm|archivedate=April 27, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lennons by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|left|Lennon and Ono in 1980, shortly before his murder]]
Lennon was also intrigued by Ono's ''Hammer a Nail''. Viewers hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet opened, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him.  Dunbar asked her, "Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it."  Ono supposedly had not heard of the [[Beatles]], but relented on the condition that Lennon pay her five [[shilling (British coin)|shilling]]s, to which Lennon replied, "I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in."&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheff|first=David|title=All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul McCartney]] told a second version of the first meeting of Ono and Lennon. In 1965, Ono was in London and compiling original musical scores for a book entitled ''[[Notations]]''; John Cage was working on the book. McCartney declined to give her any of his own manuscripts but suggested that Lennon might oblige. Lennon did, giving Ono the original handwritten lyrics to "[[The Word (song)|The Word]]".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=272}}

In a 2002 interview, she said, "I was very attracted to him. It was a really strange situation."&lt;ref name=Scot/&gt; The two began corresponding and, in September 1967, Lennon sponsored Ono's solo show at [[Lisson Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt; When Lennon's wife [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia]] asked for an explanation of why Ono was telephoning them at home, he told her that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her "avant-garde bullshit".{{sfn|Harry|2001|p=683}} In early 1968, while the Beatles were making their famous visit to India, Lennon wrote the song "[[Julia (The Beatles song)|Julia]]" and included a reference to Ono: "Ocean child calls me", referring to the translation of Yoko's Japanese spelling.&lt;ref name=nme&gt;{{cite book|chapter="Brought to Book", 31 July 1971 interview with Alan Smith|title=Uncut Presents NME Originals Beatles-The Solo Years|year=2010|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1968, while his wife was on holiday in Greece, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the ''[[Two Virgins]]'' album,&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/yoko-ono/biography#ixzz2sVEUGotR|title=Yoko Ono: Biography|publisher=''Rolling Stone''|accessdate=February 5, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410142417/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/yoko-ono/biography#ixzz2sVEUGotR|archivedate=April 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which, he said, they "made love at dawn".&lt;ref&gt;''Two Virgins'' liner notes, Apple, SAPCOR 2&lt;/ref&gt; When Lennon's wife returned home, she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon, who simply said, "Oh, hi."&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, Cynthia, ''A Twist of Lennon,'' Avon, {{ISBN|978-0-380-45450-1}}, 1978, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24 and 25, 1968, Lennon wrote and recorded "[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]",&lt;ref&gt;Spizer, Bruce, ''The Beatles on Apple Records'', 498 Productions, {{ISBN|0-9662649-4-0}}, 2003, pp. 107-108&lt;/ref&gt; which contains sexual references to Ono. A few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted, Ono became pregnant, but she suffered the miscarriage of a male child on November 21, 1968.{{sfn|Harry|2001|p=510}}&lt;ref&gt;Spitz, Bob, ''The Beatles: The Biography'', 2005, p. 800&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bed-Ins and other early collaborations===

[[Hilton Amsterdam]], March 1969]]
During the last two years that the Beatles performed, Lennon and Ono created and attended their own [[Protests against the Vietnam War|public protests against the Vietnam War]]. On March 20, 1969, they were married at the registry office in [[Gibraltar]] and spent their honeymoon in [[Amsterdam]], campaigning with a week-long [[Bed-In|Bed-In for Peace]]. They planned another Bed-In in the US, but were denied entry to the country.&lt;ref&gt;Kruse, Robert J.

Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles' song "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]".&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Ray, ''Lennon: The Definitive Biography'', 1992, p. 550&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon changed his name by [[deed poll]] on April 22, 1969, switching out ''Winston'' for ''Ono'' as a middle name.  Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Ray, ''Lennon: The Definitive Biography'', 1984b, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The couple settled at [[Tittenhurst Park]] at [[Sunninghill, Berkshire]], in southeast England.&lt;ref name="PNorman"&gt;Norman, Philip, John Lennon The Life, Hammersmith, England: Harper Collins, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-00-719741-5}}, p. 615 et seq&lt;/ref&gt; When Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-sized bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last recorded album, ''[[Abbey Road]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Emerick, Massey, 2006, pp. 279–80&lt;/ref&gt;

The two artists collaborated on many albums, beginning in 1968 when Lennon was still a Beatle, with ''[[Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins]]'', an album of experimental [[musique concrète]]. The same year, the couple contributed an experimental piece to ''[[The Beatles (album)|The White Album]]'' called "[[Revolution 9]]".  Also on ''The White Album,'' Ono contributed [[backing vocals]] on "[[Birthday (Beatles song)|Birthday]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibron|first=Bill|url=http://www.thewhitealbumproject.com/songs/side-three/|title=An in-depth Look at the Songs on Side-Three|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=The White Album Project|date=December 21, 1968|accessdate=February 1, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113003559/http://www.thewhitealbumproject.com/songs/side-three/|archivedate=January 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one line of lead vocals on "[[The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill]]".  The latter marked the only occasion in a Beatles recording in which a woman sings lead vocals.&lt;ref&gt;Lewisohn, Mark, 2000, ''The Complete Beatles Chronicle,'' London: Hamlyn, {{ISBN|978-0-600-60033-6}}, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jlbedin3.JPG|thumb|Lennon and Ono recording [[Give Peace a Chance]], at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]], Montreal, 1969]]
Ono influenced Lennon to produce more "autobiographical" output and, after "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]", they decided it would be better to form their own band rather than put the material out under the Beatles name.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian MacDonald|McDonald, Ian]], ''[[Revolution in the Head]],'' 3rd ed., Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-55652-733-3}}, 1556527330&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, the Plastic Ono Band's first album, ''[[Live Peace in Toronto 1969]]'', was recorded during the [[Toronto Rock and Roll Revival]] festival. This first incarnation of the group also consisted of guitarist [[Eric Clapton]], bass player [[Klaus Voormann]], and drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]]. The first half of their performance consisted of rock standards. During the second half, Ono took to the microphone and performed an [[avant-garde]] set along with the band, finishing with music that consisted mainly of [[Audio feedback|feedback]], while she screamed and sang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpgr.co.uk/core2001.html|last=Calkin|first=Graham|title=Live Peace in Toronto 1969|publisher=Jpgr.co.uk|accessdate=February 1, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009190538/http://www.jpgr.co.uk/core2001.html|archivedate=October 9, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blaney, John (2005).

===First solo album and ''Fly''===
{{main|Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band|John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band|Fly (Yoko Ono album)}}
Ono released her first solo album, ''[[Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band]]'', in 1970 as a companion piece to Lennon's better-known ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]''. The two albums also had companion covers: Ono's featured a photo of her leaning on Lennon, and Lennon's a photo of him leaning on Ono. Her album included raw, harsh vocals, which bore a similarity with sounds in nature (especially those made by animals) and [[free jazz]] techniques used by wind and brass players. Performers included [[Ornette Coleman]], other renowned [[free jazz]] performers, and [[Ringo Starr]]. Some songs on the album consisted of wordless vocalizations, in a style that would influence [[Meredith Monk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/blog/women-music-trailblazing-female-singers-songwriters-and-musicians/6|title=Women in Music: Trailblazing Female Singers, Songwriters and Musicians|publisher=makers.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203025326/http://www.makers.com/blog/women-music-trailblazing-female-singers-songwriters-and-musicians/6|archivedate=February 3, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other musical artists who have used screams and vocal noise in lieu of words.

When Lennon was invited to play with [[Frank Zappa]] at the [[The Fillmore|Fillmore]] (then the Filmore West) on June 5, 1971, Ono joined them.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes to Disc 2, ''Sometime in New York City'' album.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, she released ''[[Fly (Yoko Ono album)|Fly]]'', a double album. In it, she explored slightly more conventional [[psychedelic rock]] with tracks including "Midsummer New York" and "Mind Train", in addition to a number of Fluxus experiments.  She also received minor airplay with the ballad "[[Mrs. Lennon]]".  The track "[[Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)|Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)]]" was an ode to Ono's missing daughter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Beatles: An illustrated record|page=83|year=1978|publisher=Harmony Books|isbn=0-517-53367-7|author1=Carr, R.|author2=Tyler, T.|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featured Eric Clapton on guitar. In the late 1960s, while studying with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] in [[Majorca]], Spain, Ono's ex-husband Anthony Cox accused Ono of abducting their daughter Kyoko from his hotel. Accusations flew between the two, as well as the matter of custody. Cox eventually moved away with Kyoko; Ono would not see her daughter until 1998.&lt;ref name=BioChannel/&gt; It was during this time that she wrote "Don't Worry Kyoko", which also appears on Lennon and Ono's album ''[[Live Peace in Toronto 1969]]'', in addition to ''Fly''. Kyoko is also referenced in the first line of "[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)|Happy Christmas (War Is Over)]]" when Yoko whispers "Happy Christmas, Kyoko", followed by Lennon whispering, "Happy Christmas, [[Julian Lennon|Julian]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Andrew Grant.

In a 2018 issue of [[Portland Magazine]], editor [[Colin Sargent|Colin W. Sargent]] writes of interviewing Yoko while she was visiting Portland, Maine in 2005. She spoke of driving along the coast with Lennon and dreamed of buying a house in Maine. "We talked excitedly in the car. We were looking for a house on the water… We did examine the place! We kept driving north along the water until I don't really remember the name of the town. We went quite a ways up, actually, because it was so beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Portland Magazine,2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Separation from Lennon and reconciliation==
After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Ono and Lennon lived together in London and then moved permanently to [[Manhattan]] in order to escape tabloid racism towards Ono.&lt;ref name=TA&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/02/john-lennon-radical-left-tariq-ali|title=John Lennon's power for the people|date=Feb 2, 2010|last=Ali|first=Tariq|newspaper=The Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109115346/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/02/john-lennon-radical-left-tariq-ali|archivedate=January 9, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship became strained because Lennon was facing the threat of deportation due to drug charges that had been filed against him in England, and because of Ono's separation from her daughter. The couple separated in July 1973, with Ono pursuing her career and Lennon living between [[Los Angeles]] and New York with personal assistant [[May Pang]]; Ono had given her blessing to Lennon and Pang.&lt;ref name=Separation&gt;{{cite book|first=Geoffrey Giuliano|last=Brenda Giuliano|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVpXvJn0ZZIC&amp;pg=RA2-PA260&amp;vq=Pang&amp;dq=%22may+pang%22#PRA2-PA213,M1|title=Press Release Interview with May Pang|accessdate=June 9, 2011|isbn=978-0-7119-6470-9|year=1998|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101162507/http://books.google.com/books?id=kVpXvJn0ZZIC&amp;pg=RA2-PA260&amp;vq=Pang&amp;dq=%22may+pang%22#PRA2-PA213,M1|archivedate=January 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Harry|2001|p=698-99}}

By December 1974, Lennon and Pang considered buying a house together, and he refused to accept Ono's phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet with Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.{{sfn|Harry|2001|p=700-01}}

Ono and Lennon's son, [[Sean Lennon|Sean]], was born on October 9, 1975, which coincidentally was Lennon's 35th birthday. John did not help relations with his first son when he described [[Julian Lennon|Julian]] in 1980 as being part of the "ninety percent of the people on this planet [who resulted from an unplanned pregnancy]" and that "Sean is a planned child, and therein lies the difference." He said, "I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days."&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Willman|first=Chris|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/stop-the-presses/julian-lennon-50-never-much-too-lennon-family-004241541.html?pt=2|title=Julian Lennon at 50: It's Never 'Much Too Late' For Lennon Family Discord &amp;#124; Stop The Presses!

===Lennon's murder, tributes, and memorials===
{{main|Murder of John Lennon}}

Following Sean's birth in 1975, Lennon took a hiatus from the music industry and became a [[househusband]] to care for his infant son. He resumed his songwriting career shortly before his December 1980 [[Death of John Lennon|murder]], which Ono witnessed at close range. She stated the couple was thinking about going out to dinner after spending several hours in a recording studio, but decided to return to their apartment instead, because Lennon wanted to see Sean before he was put to bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Lennon Remembered|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-lennon-remembered-08-12-2005/|publisher=CBS News|date=Dec 8, 2005|last=Dakss|first=Brian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426211600/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-lennon-remembered-08-12-2005/|archivedate=April 26, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her husband's murder, Ono went into complete seclusion for an extended period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/Yoko-Ono-headlining-shows-for-Japan-relief-efforts/8037478|title=Yoko Ono headlining shows for Japan relief efforts|publisher=On the Red Carpet|last=Allin|first=Olivia|date=March 27, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106130956/http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/Yoko-Ono-headlining-shows-for-Japan-relief-efforts/8037478|archivedate=November 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yoko Ono 2005.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ono delivering flowers to Lennon's memorial [[Strawberry Fields (memorial)|Strawberry Fields]] in [[Central Park]] on the 25th anniversary of his death, December 8, 2005.]]
Ono funded the construction and maintenance of the [[Strawberry Fields memorial]] in Manhattan's [[Central Park]], directly across from the [[The Dakota|Dakota Apartments]], which was the scene of the murder and remains Ono's residence to this day. It was officially dedicated on October 9, 1985, which would have been his 45th birthday. In 1990, Ono collaborated with music consultant [[Jeff Pollack (Media Consultant)|Jeff Pollack]] to honor what would have been Lennon's 50th birthday with a worldwide broadcast of [[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]].  Over 1,000 stations in over 50 countries participated in the simultaneous broadcast. Ono felt the timing was perfect, considering the escalating conflicts in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Worldwide Broadcast Planned in Honor of Lennon's 50th Birthday|newspaper=The Tufts Daily|date=October 5, 1990|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, she founded the [[John Lennon Museum]] in [[Saitama, Saitama]], Japan. In March 2002, she was present with [[Cherie Blair]] at the unveiling of a seven-foot statue of Lennon, to mark the renaming of [[Liverpool]] airport to [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]].&lt;ref name=Scot/&gt; (Julian and Cynthia Lennon were present at the unveiling of the [[John Lennon Peace Monument]] next to [[ACC Liverpool]] in the same city eight years later.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/news/a-monument-in-the-life|title=A Monument in the Life|author=Steve Hochman, GRAMMY.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221185840/http://www.grammy.com/news/a-monument-in-the-life|archivedate=February 21, 2014|df=mdy-all}}
&lt;/ref&gt; On October 9, 2007, she dedicated a new memorial called the [[Imagine Peace Tower]], located on the island of [[Viðey]], 1&amp;nbsp;km outside the Skarfabakki harbour in [[Reykjavík]], Iceland. Each year, between October 9 and December 8, it projects a vertical beam of light high into the sky. In 2009, Ono created an exhibit called "John Lennon: The New York City Years" for the NYC [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] Annex. The exhibit used music, photographs, and personal items to depict Lennon's life in New York, and a portion of the cost of each ticket was donated to Spirit Foundation, a charitable foundation set up by Lennon and Ono.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespiritfoundation.com|title=Spirit Foundation|accessdate=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every time Lennon's killer [[Mark David Chapman]] has a parole hearing – which is mandated by law every two years – Ono has come out strongly against his release from prison. She is the widow of the victim, and her opinion has a strong influence on the parole board's decision to keep Chapman behind bars.

==Artwork==

===Fluxus===
Ono is often associated with the Fluxus group, which was founded by [[George Maciunas]], who was her friend during the 1960s. Maciunas admired and enthusiastically promoted her work and gave Ono her U.S. show at his AG Gallery in 1961. He formally invited her to join the Fluxus group, but she declined because she wanted to remain independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newhall|first=Edith|title=A Long and Winding Road|publisher=ARTnews|date=Oct 2000|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did, however, collaborate with him,{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=40-41}} [[Charlotte Moorman]], [[George Brecht]], and the poet [[Jackson Mac Low]], among others associated with the group.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233}}

[[John Cage]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] were significant influences on Ono's art.&lt;ref name=NYsl&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/21934/|title=Influences: Sean Lennon|date=Oct 9, 2009|last=Cardace|first=Sara|publisher=New York magazine|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708020759/http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/21934/|archivedate=July 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=17}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/30/160327305/33-musicians-on-what-john-cage-communicates|title=33 Musicians on What John Cage Communicates|last=Blau|first=Max|date=Sep 5, 2012|publisher=npr.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221094215/http://www.npr.org/2012/08/30/160327305/33-musicians-on-what-john-cage-communicates|archivedate=February 21, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She learned of Cage at Sarah Lawrence&lt;ref name=MH232/&gt; and met him through his student Ichiyanagi Toshi in Cage's legendary experimental composition class at the [[New School for Social Research]]:{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=65}} She was thus introduced to more of Cage's unconventional [[neo-Dada]]ism first hand and his New York City protégés [[Allan Kaprow]], Brecht, Mac Low, [[Al Hansen]] and the poet [[Dick Higgins]].{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233}}

After Cage finished teaching at the New School in the summer of 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found an inexpensive loft in downtown [[Manhattan]] at 112 [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] and used the apartment as a studio and living space. Ono supported herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the [[Japan Society of New York|Japan Society]], and she allowed composer [[La Monte Young]] to organize concerts in the loft.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233}} They both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961;&lt;ref name=MH232/&gt; the events were attended by people such as [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Peggy Guggenheim]].&lt;ref name=MH21&gt;{{harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ono and Young both claimed to have been the primary curator of these events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kotz, Liz|title=Post-Cagean Aesthetics and the "Event" Score|journal=October|volume=95|date=Winter 2001|jstor=779200|pages=55–89 [56]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=65}} The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including ''Painting to Be Stepped On'', which was a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.&lt;ref name=MH21/&gt;

Ono is credited for the album cover art for ''Nirvana Symphony'' by [[Toshiro Mayuzumi]] (Time Records, 1962).

===''Cut Piece,'' 1964===
Ono was a pioneer of [[conceptual art]] and [[performance art]]. A seminal performance work is ''Cut Piece,'' first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto, Japan. The piece consisted of Ono, dressed in her best suit, kneeling on a stage with a pair of scissors in front of her. She invited and then instructed audience members to join her on stage and cut pieces of her clothing off. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion.&lt;ref name=MH158&gt;{{harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was subsequently performed at the Sogetsu Art Centre in Tokyo that same year, New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1965 and London's [[Africa Centre, London|Africa Center]] as part of the [[Destruction in Art Symposium]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phelan|first1=Peggy|editor1-last=Butler|editor1-first=Cornelia|editor1-link=WACK!: Art and the Feminist Revolution|title=The Returns of Touch: Feminist Performances, 1960-80|date=2007|publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art|location=Los Angeles|page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the piece, John Hendricks in the catalogue to Ono's Japan Society retrospective wrote: "[''Cut Piece''] unveils the interpersonal alienation that characterizes social relationships between subjects, dismantling the disinterested Kantian aesthetic model..... It demonstrates the reciprocity between artists, objects, and viewers and the responsibility beholders have to the reception and preservation of art."&lt;ref name="MH158" /&gt;

Other performers of the piece have included Charlotte Moorman and John Hendricks.&lt;ref name="MH158" /&gt; Ono reprised the piece in [[Paris]] in 2003, in the low [[post-9/11]] period between the US and France, saying she hoped to show that this is "a time where we need to trust each other".&lt;ref name="Stan" /&gt; In 2013, the Canadian singer, [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]] reprised it at the multi-day Meltdown festival at the [[Southbank Centre]] in London, which Ono curated.&lt;ref name="guML"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/23/yoko-ono-meltdown-2013-review|last=Empire|first=Kitty|title=Yoko Ono's Meltdown – review|date=June 22, 2013|publisher=The Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231011026/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/23/yoko-ono-meltdown-2013-review|archivedate=December 31, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Grapefruit'' book, 1964===
{{main|Grapefruit (book)}}

Ono's small book titled ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit]]'' is another seminal piece of conceptual art.  First published in 1964, the book reads as a set of instructions through which the work of art is completed-either literally or in the imagination of the viewer participant. One example is "Hide and Seek Piece: Hide until everybody goes home. Hide until everybody forgets about you. Hide until everybody dies."  ''Grapefruit'' has been published several times, most widely distributed by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1971, who reprinted it again in 2000. [[:de:David Bourdon|David Bourdon]], art critic for ''[[The Village Voice]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', called ''Grapefruit'' "one of the monuments of conceptual art of the early 1960s".  He noted that her conceptual approach was made more acceptable when white male artists like [[Joseph Kosuth]] and [[Lawrence Weiner]] came in and "did virtually the same things" she did, and that her take also has a poetic and lyrical side that sets it apart from the work of other conceptual artists.&lt;ref name=Whit/&gt;

Ono would enact many of the book's scenarios as performance pieces throughout her career, which formed the basis for her art exhibitions, including the highly publicized [[retrospective exhibition]], ''This Is Not Here'' in 1971 at the [[Everson Museum]] in [[Syracuse, New York]],&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&amp;q=596#v=snippet&amp;q=596&amp;f=false|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Joan M.

Nearly fifty years later in July 2013, she released a sequel to ''Grapefruit'', another book of instructions, ''Acorn'' via [[OR Books]].&lt;ref name=OR&gt;{{cite book|last=Ono|first=Yoko|title=Acorn|publisher=OR Books|year=2013|isbn=978-1-939293-23-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental films, 1964–72===
Ono was also an [[experimental filmmaker]] who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply ''No. 4'', often referred to as ''Bottoms.''&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono/films.html|publisher=Biography Channel (UK)|title=Yoko Ono Biography: Films|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202100643/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono/films.html|archivedate=February 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICA/&gt; The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on a treadmill. The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the [[gluteal cleft]] and the [[horizontal gluteal crease]].

Another example of Ono's participatory art was her ''Wish Tree'' project, in which a tree native to the installation site is installed. Her 1996 ''Wish Piece'' had the following instructions:

:Make a wish
:Write it down on a piece of paper
:Fold it and tie it around a branch of a Wish Tree
:Ask your friends to do the same
:Keep wishing
:Until the branches are covered with wishes.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=294}}

=== ''Arising,'' 2015 ===
In 2015, Ono created the piece ''Arising'' in [[Venice]]. As part of the exhibition ''Personal Structures'', organised by Global Art Affairs, the installation was on view from June 1 through November 24, 2013, at the [[European Cultural Centre]]'s [[Palazzo Bembo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/call-women-whitehot-magazine-interview/2792|title=WM {{!}} whitehot magazine of contemporary art {{!}} June 2013: Yoko Ono: Arising a call for Women - the Whitehot Magazine Interview|website=whitehotmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113150417/https://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/call-women-whitehot-magazine-interview/2792|archivedate=January 13, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this feminist work of art, female [[silicon]] bodies were burnt in the [[Venetian lagoon]], evoking the imagery of mythical [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]es. When asked for the resemblance between the naming of her record ''Rising'' and this piece, Ono responded: "''Rising'' was telling all people that it is time for us to rise and fight for our rights. But in the process of fighting together, women are still being treated separately in an inhuman way. It weakens the power of men and women all together. I hope ''Arising'' will wake up Women Power, and make us, men and women, heal together."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nyartsmagazine.com/?p=15615|title=Sarah Gold and Karlyn De Jongh Talk with Yoko Ono - NY Arts Magazine|date=January 31, 2014|work=NY Arts Magazine|access-date=July 11, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the [[Whitney Museum]] held a [[retrospective]] of her work, '''''Yoko Ono: Objects, Films''''', marking Ono's reentry into the New York art world after a hiatus. At the suggestion of Ono's live-in companion at the time,  interior decorator [[Sam Havadtoy]], she recast her old pieces in bronze after some initial reluctance. "I realized that for something to move me so much that I would cry, there's something there. There seemed like a shimmering air in the 60s when I made these pieces, and now the air is bronzified. Now it's the 80s, and bronze is very 80s in a way - solidity, commodity, all of that. For someone who went through the 60s revolution, there has of course been an incredible change. . . . I call the pieces petrified bronze. That freedom, all the hope and wishes are in some ways petrified."&lt;ref name=Whit&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Taylor|authorlink=Paul Taylor (art critic)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/05/arts/art-yoko-ono-s-new-bronze-age-at-the-whitney.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Yoko Ono's New Bronze Age at the Whitney|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 5, 1989|accessdate=January 31, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113183517/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/05/arts/art-yoko-ono-s-new-bronze-age-at-the-whitney.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|archivedate=November 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==

===Early career===
Ono studied piano from the age of 4 to 12 or 13. She attended [[kabuki]] performances with her mother, who was trained in [[shamisen]], [[koto (instrument)|koto]], [[otsuzumi]], [[kotsuzumi]], [[nagauta]], and could read Japanese musical scores. At 14 Yoko took up vocal training in [[lieder]]-singing. At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with [[Alastair Reid]], [[English literature]] with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the [[Vienna|Viennese]]-trained André Singer.&lt;ref name=MH231/&gt; Of this time Ono has said that her heroes were the [[twelve tone technique|twelve-tone composers]] [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alban Berg]]. She said, "I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [an] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and..... he said, 'Well, look, there are people who are doing things like what you do and they're called avant-garde.'"

===1980s===
In early 1980, John Lennon heard [[Lene Lovich]] and [[the B-52's]]' "[[Rock Lobster]]" while on vacation in Bermuda. The latter reminded him of Ono's musical sound and he took this as an indication that she had reached the mainstream&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-eighties-20110418/john-lennon-and-yoko-ono-double-fantasy-20110322|title=#29: John Lennon and Yoko Ono, ''Double Fantasy''|accessdate=April 18, 2014|work=Rolling Stone|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203182000/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-eighties-20110418/john-lennon-and-yoko-ono-double-fantasy-20110322|archivedate=February 3, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the band in fact had been influenced by Ono).&lt;ref name=ape/&gt; In addition to her collaborations with experimental artists including John Cage and jazz legend Ornette Coleman, many other musicians, particularly those of the [[New wave music|new wave]] movement, have paid tribute to Ono (both as an artist in her own right, and as a [[muse]] and [[icon|iconic figure]]). For example, [[Elvis Costello]] recorded a version of Ono's song "[[Walking on Thin Ice]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello/_/Walking+On+Thin+Ice|title=Elvis Costello-Walking on Thin Ice|publisher=last.fm|accessdate=February 7, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309053759/http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello/_/Walking+On+Thin+Ice|archivedate=March 9, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the B-52's (who drew from her early recordings)&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; covered "Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)" (shortening the title to "Don't Worry"), and [[Sonic Youth]] included a performance of Ono's early conceptual "Voice Piece for Soprano" on their [[Experimental music|experimental]] album ''[[SYR4: Goodbye 20th Century]]''.&lt;ref name=NME&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/artistKeyname/1664|title=SYR4 - Goodbye 20th Century|publisher=''NME''|date=December 1, 1999|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223061001/http://www.nme.com/reviews/artistKeyname/1664|archivedate=February 23, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of December 8, 1980, Lennon and Ono were in the [[Record Plant|Record Plant Studio]] and working on Ono's song "Walking on Thin Ice". When they returned to The Dakota (their home in Manhattan), Lennon was shot dead by [[Mark David Chapman]], a deranged fan who had been stalking Lennon for two months. "Walking on Thin Ice (For John)" was released as a single less than a month later, and became Ono's first chart success, peaking at No. 58 and gaining major underground airplay. In 1981, she released the album ''[[Season of Glass]]'', which featured the striking cover photo of Lennon's bloody spectacles next to a half-filled glass of water, with a window overlooking Central Park in the background. This photograph sold at an auction in London in April 2002 for about $13,000. In the [[liner notes]] to ''Season of Glass'', Ono explained that the album was not dedicated to Lennon because "he would have been offended—he was one of us." The album received highly favorable reviews&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; and reflected the public's mood after Lennon's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/season-of-glass-r46036 AllMusic Season of Glass Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218232922/http://www.allmusic.com/album/season-of-glass-r46036 |date=December 18, 2010 }}.

In 1982, she released ''[[It's Alright (I See Rainbows)|It's Alright]]''. The cover featured Ono in her famous wrap-around sunglasses, looking towards the sun, while on the back the ghost of Lennon looks over her and their son.

In 1984, a tribute album titled ''[[Every Man Has a Woman]]'' was released, featuring a selection of Ono songs performed by artists such as Elvis Costello, [[Roberta Flack]], [[Eddie Money]], [[Rosanne Cash]], and [[Harry Nilsson]].&lt;ref name=Ev&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/every-man-has-a-woman-mw0000193725/credits|title=Various Artists, Every Man Has a Woman, Credits|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=February 7, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908235717/http://www.allmusic.com/album/every-man-has-a-woman-mw0000193725/credits|archivedate=September 8, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of Lennon's projects that he never got to finish.

Ono's final album of the 1980s was ''[[Starpeace]]'', a [[concept album]] that she intended as an antidote to [[Ronald Reagan]]'s "[[Strategic Defense Initiative|Star Wars]]" [[National missile defense|missile defense system]]. On the cover, a warm, smiling Ono holds the Earth in the palm of her hand. ''Starpeace'' became Ono's most successful non-Lennon effort.  The single "[[Hell in Paradise]]" was a hit, reaching No. 16 on the US dance charts and No. 26 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] Hot 100, and the video, directed by [[Zbigniew Rybczyński]] received major airplay on MTV and won "Most Innovative Video" at Billboard Music Video Awards in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZBIG RYBCZYNSKI::FILM AND VIDEO AWARD|url=http://www.zbigvision.com/zbigsawards.html|work=ZBIG RYBCZYNSKI|accessdate=July 26, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723194533/http://www.zbigvision.com/zbigsawards.html|archivedate=July 23, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Ono set out on a goodwill world tour for ''Starpeace'', primarily visiting Eastern European countries.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

For many years, Ono was frequently criticized by both the press and the public. She was blamed for the breakup of the Beatles{{sfn|Badman|1999|p=40}}&lt;ref name=Dub/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/087/000023018/|title=Yoko Ono|publisher=Nndb.com|date=|accessdate=August 24, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905080411/http://www.nndb.com/people/087/000023018/|archivedate=September 5, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and repeatedly criticized for her influence over Lennon and his music.&lt;ref name="allmusicB"/&gt; Her experimental art was also not popularly accepted.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; The British press was particularly negative and prompted the couple's move to the US.&lt;ref name=TA/&gt; As late as December 1999, ''[[NME]]'' was calling her a "no-talent charlatan".&lt;ref name=NME/&gt;

Her name still connotes the figure of the evil female interloper to the mainstream.

When American singer [[Jessica Simpson]] was dating [[Dallas Cowboys]] quarterback [[Tony Romo]] in 2007, the Simpson-Romo relationship was blamed for Romo's poor performances.

Ono has been an [[Activism|activist]] for peace and human rights since the 1960s. After she and Lennon married in Gibraltar, they held a March 1969 "Bed-In for Peace" in their honeymoon suite at the Amsterdam [[Hilton Hotel]].&lt;ref name=RS/&gt; The newlyweds were eager to talk about and promote [[world peace]]; they wore pajamas and invited visitors and members of the press. Two months later, Ono and Lennon held another Bed-In at the Queen Elizabeth [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont]] in Montreal, where they recorded their first single, "[[Give Peace A Chance]]".&lt;ref name=PN/&gt; The song became a top-20 hit for the newly christened Plastic Ono Band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-lennon-mn0000232564/awards|title=John Lennon: Awards|publisher=AllMusic|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015040256/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-lennon-mn0000232564/awards|archivedate=October 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other performance/demonstrations with John included "bagism," iterations with John of the ''Bag Piece''s she introduced in the early 1960s,{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=162-65}} which encouraged a disregard for physical appearance in judging others.&lt;ref name=allmusicB/&gt; In December 1969, the two continued spread their message of peace with billboards in 12 major world cities reading "WAR IS OVER!

On Valentine's Day 2003, which was the eve of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraqi invasion by the US and UK]], Ono heard about a couple, Andrew and Christine Gale, who were holding a love-in protest in their tiny bedroom in [[Addingham, West Yorkshire]].

==Relationship with the Beatles==
{{main|Break-up of the Beatles}}

Lennon and Ono were injured in a car accident in June 1969, partway through recording ''[[Abbey Road]]''. According to journalist [[Barry Miles]], a bed with a microphone was then installed in the studio so that Ono could make artistic comments about the album.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=552}} Miles thought Ono's continual presence in the studio during the latter part of the Beatles' career put strain on Lennon's relationship with the other band members.

While the Beatles were together, every song written by Lennon or McCartney was credited as [[Lennon–McCartney]] regardless of whether the song was a [[collaboration]] or written solely by one of the two (except for those appearing on their first album, ''Please Please Me'', which originally credited the songs to McCartney–Lennon). In 1976, McCartney released a live album called ''[[Wings over America]]'', which credited the five Beatles tracks as P. McCartney–J. Lennon compositions, but neither Lennon nor Ono objected. After Lennon's death, however, McCartney again attempted to change the order to McCartney–Lennon for songs that were solely or predominantly written by him, such as "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/2588861.stm|title=Talking Point &amp;#124; Lennon-McCartney: Who do you give credit to?|publisher=BBC News|date=December 23, 2002|accessdate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407163230/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/2588861.stm|archivedate=April 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Ono would not allow it, saying she felt this broke an agreement that the two had made while Lennon was still alive, and the surviving Beatle argued that such an agreement never existed. A spokesman for Ono said McCartney was making "an attempt to rewrite history".&lt;ref name="billboard_controversy"/&gt;

In a ''Rolling Stone'' interview in 1987, Ono pointed out McCartney's place in the process of the disintegration of the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/yoko-ono-blames-paul-mccartney-beatles-breakup-979558|title=Yoko Ono Blames Paul McCartney for the Beatles' Breakup?|last=Vultaggio|first=Maria|date=December 29, 2012|work=International Business Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231180229/http://www.ibtimes.com/yoko-ono-blames-paul-mccartney-beatles-breakup-979558|archivedate=December 31, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 1998 John Lennon anthology, ''[[Lennon Legend]]'', the composer credit of "Give Peace a Chance" was changed to "John Lennon" from its original composing credit of "Lennon–McCartney". Although the song was written by Lennon during his tenure with the Beatles, it was both written and recorded without the help of the band, and released as Lennon's first independent single under the "Plastic Ono Band" moniker. Lennon subsequently expressed regret that he had not given co-writing credit to Ono instead, who actually helped him write the song.&lt;ref name=PN/&gt; In 2002, McCartney released another live album, ''Back in the U.S. Live 2002'', and the 19 Beatles songs included are described as "composed by Paul McCartney and John Lennon", which reignited the debate over credits with Ono. Her spokesperson Elliott Mintz called it "an attempt to rewrite history", but nevertheless, Ono did not sue.&lt;ref name="billboard_controversy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73102/update-mccartney-reignites-beatles-credit-controversy|title=Update: McCartney Reignites Beatles Credit Controversy|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=February 14, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004204132/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73102/update-mccartney-reignites-beatles-credit-controversy|archivedate=October 4, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, after the Beatles released Lennon's "[[Free as a Bird]]" and "[[Real Love (John Lennon song)|Real Love]]", with demos provided by Ono, McCartney and his family collaborated with her and Sean to create the song "Hiroshima Sky is Always Blue", which commemorates the 50th anniversary of the [[Hiroshima Massacre|atomic bombing of that Japanese city]]. Of Ono, McCartney stated: "I thought she was a cold woman. I think that's wrong..... she's just the opposite..... I think she's just more determined than most people to be herself." Two years later, however, Ono publicly compared Lennon to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], while McCartney, she said, more closely resembled his less-talented rival [[Antonio Salieri]].&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Gilbert.

Accepting an award at the 2005 [[Q Awards]], Ono mentioned that Lennon had once felt insecure about his songwriting. She had responded, "You're a good songwriter. It's not June with spoon that you write. You're a good singer, and most musicians are probably a little bit nervous about covering your songs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/yoko-ono-claims-she-was-misquoted-over-mccartney-outburst-319727.html?origin=internalSearch|work=The Independent|location=London|title=Yoko Ono claims she was misquoted over McCartney outburst|first=Ian|last=Herbert|date=October 15, 2005|accessdate=February 1, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225032027/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/yoko-ono-claims-she-was-misquoted-over-mccartney-outburst-319727.html?origin=internalSearch|archivedate=February 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2010 interview, Ono spoke about Lennon's "lost weekend" and her subsequent reconciliation with him. She credited McCartney with helping save her marriage to John.

===Relationship with Julian Lennon===
{{main|John Lennon#Julian Lennon}}
Ono had a difficult relationship with her stepson [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], but the relationship has improved over the years. He has expressed disappointment at her handling of Lennon's estate, and at the difference between his upbringing and Sean's, adding, "when Dad gave up music for a couple of years to be with Sean, why couldn't he do that with me?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8933287/Julian-Lennon-blames-father-John-for-his-lack-of-children.html|title=Julian Lennon blames father John for his lack of children|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=December 4, 2011|accessdate=February 21, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327161916/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8933287/Julian-Lennon-blames-father-John-for-his-lack-of-children.html|archivedate=March 27, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; More egregiously, however, Julian was left out of his father's will, and he battled Ono in court for years, settling in 1996 for an unspecified amount that the papers reported was "believed to" be in the area of £20&amp;nbsp;million, which Julian has denied.&lt;ref name=Scot/&gt;

He has admitted that he is his "mother's boy", which Ono has cited as the reason why she was never able to get close to him: "Julian and I tried to be friends. Of course, if he's too friendly with me, then I think that it hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That was the first thing that was in his mind."&lt;ref name=yahoo1/&gt; Nevertheless, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian's photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City in 2010,&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt; appearing for the first time for photos with Cynthia and Julian.&lt;ref name=yahoo1/&gt; She also promoted the exhibition on her website, and Julian and Sean are close.&lt;ref name="Imagine Peace"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
Canadian rock band [[Barenaked Ladies]]' debut single was "[[Be My Yoko Ono]]," first released in 1990 and later appearing on their 1992 album ''[[Gordon (album)|Gordon]]''.&lt;ref name=FM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/_/Be+My+Yoko+Ono|title=Barenaked Ladies: Be My Yoko Ono|publisher=last.fm|accessdate=February 7, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105123126/http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/_/Be+My+Yoko+Ono|archivedate=November 5, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics are "a shy entreaty to a potential girlfriend, caged in terms that self-deflatingly compare himself to one of pop music's foremost geniuses".  It also has a "sarcastic imitation of Yoko Ono's unique vocal style in the bridge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/be-my-yoko-ono-mt0006937715|title=Barenaked Ladies: Be My Yoko Ono (Overview)|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=February 7, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129225235/http://www.allmusic.com/song/be-my-yoko-ono-mt0006937715|archivedate=January 29, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, American folk singer [[Dar Williams]] recorded a song titled "I Won't Be Your Yoko Ono".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.discogs.com/Dar-Williams-I-Wont-Be-Your-Yoko-Ono/release/3762272|title=Dar Williams - I Won't Be Your Yoko Ono|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan Wawzenek of the website ''Ultimate Classic Rock'' described the song as "us[ing] John and Yoko as a starting point for exploring love, and particularly, love between artists".&lt;ref name="Ultimate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/yoko-ono-inspired-songs/|title=Top 10 Songs Inspired by Yoko Ono|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=June 24, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619103724/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/yoko-ono-inspired-songs/|archivedate=June 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British band [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] mentioned Ono in their song "New York Morning" from their 2014 album ''[[The Take Off and Landing of Everything]]'' ("Oh, my giddy aunt, New York can talk / It's the modern Rome and folk are nice to Yoko"). In response Ono posted an open letter to the band on her website, thanking them and reflecting on her and Lennon's relationship with the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/elbow/75881|title=Yoko Ono thanks Elbow for new song 'New York Morning' in open letter|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=March 5, 2014|website=[[NME.com]]|accessdate=April 23, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308151301/http://www.nme.com/news/elbow/75881|archivedate=March 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s song "[[Bring the Noise]]", [[Chuck D]] and [[Flavor Flav]] rap, "Beat is for [[Sonny Bono]]/Beat is for Yoko Ono!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m07nCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=beat+is+for+sonny+bono+beat+is+for+yoko+ono&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_6z-qgvRPK&amp;sig=IcYIHza-HYHqw0LiPqmA1C50kYc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP89b825jVAhVD52MKHXSdB98Q6AEIRDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=beat+is+for+sonny+bono+beat+is+for+yoko+ono&amp;f=false|title=Dancing in Your Head: Jazz, Blues, Rock, and Beyond|first=Gene|last=Santoro|date=December 29, 1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=baaFL4PyjS0C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=beat+is+for+sonny+bono+beat+is+for+yoko+ono&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1rGgXCmp2f&amp;sig=u23Hdd8JxTX5m2hRro-ETNA3Kvc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP89b825jVAhVD52MKHXSdB98Q6AEISjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=beat+is+for+sonny+bono+beat+is+for+yoko+ono&amp;f=false|title=SPIN|first=SPIN Media|last=LLC|date=February 1, 1988|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-punk rock band [[Death of Samantha]] named themselves after a song from Ono's 1972 album ''[[Approximately Infinite Universe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Evans, "Death of Samantha: Notes from the Underground," ''The Plain Dealer Magazine,'' February 22, 1987, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|one of the six ''[[dravya]]s'' in Jainism|the Hindu and Buddhist term Ākāśa referring to æther or space|Ākāśa}}
{{refimprove|date=March 2018}}
{{Jainism}}
'''''Ākāśa''''' is [[space]] in the [[Jainism|Jain]] conception of the [[Jain cosmology|cosmos]]. Akash is one of the six ''[[Dravya (Jainism)|dravya]]s'' (substances) and it accommodates&lt;ref&gt;Uttaradhyan sutra, Ch. 28&lt;/ref&gt; the other five, namely sentient beings or souls (''[[Jīva (Jainism)|jīva]]''), non-sentient substance or matter (''[[pudgala]]''), principle of motion (''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]''), the principle of rest (''[[adharma]]'') and time (''[[kāla (time)|kāla]]'')

Akasha provides the space for other substances.&lt;ref&gt;http://nirgranth.in/6-dravya/&lt;/ref&gt; Akasha does not act as an obstruction. There are two types of Ākāśa: Lokakasha and Alokakasha. Alokakasha is beyond the Lokakasha and is empty; it has no other substance. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jainbelief.com/PPOJ/10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jainsamaj.org/content.php?url=Jainism_-_Jain_Cosmology:-_By&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Ākāśa is a compound word of Sanskrit language, wherein "ā" refers to "towards" and "kāśa" refers "to be visible or to appear".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=73983&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Akasha is the subtle “background” against which everything in the material universe becomes perceptible.{{sfn|Yogananda|2007|p=867}}

== Attributes ==
Space provides room to all other substances of the universe. The characteristic of space is to give room to or accommodate the other substances. The special feature of space is that it is not restricted to the universe like other substances but extends beyond the universe to the non-universe. 

Its qualities are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/6dravya.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*Provides room to soul, matter, medium of motion, and medium of rest
*Pervades everywhere (infinite)
*Supports everything and thus it is self supported
*Have no form, color, taste, smell, and touch
*Does not perform any active action (inactive)
*Provides accommodation to soul and matter of their actions
*Is one and whole

Sky and space both are different. We can see the sky because it is modification of the [[Pudgala]] whereas space is invisible.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jainpushp.org/munishriji/ss-5-seven-tattava.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Akasha ==
[[File:Jain universe.JPG|thumb|300px|Structure of Universe according to the Jain scriptures.]]

Space substance is only one substance and as such it is indivisible (akhand).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atmadharma.com/shastras/laghujainsiddhant_eng_txt/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, universe (lokakasha) and non-universe (alokakasha) are considered its two divisions.
Space is divided into two parts:
*Lokakas - Where medium of motion and rest substances exist
*Alokakas - The remaining space, which is empty and void.
The dimension of Lokakasha is fourteen ''rajlok'' or ''rajju'', however Alokakasha is [[infinity|infinite]].&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/6dravya.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lokakasha===
That portion of space in which all the substances are found is called the universe (lokakash). There are three types of Lokakasha; a) Urdhwa Lok, where beings of higher qualities than us live (Siddha Lok where liberated souls stay is at the top of Urdhwalok), b) Madhya Lok - where human beings and other creatures live, and c) Adho Lok, where the inmates of hell live (it has seven layers).

At the summit of the ''lokākāśa'' is the ''[[Siddhashila]]'' (abode of the liberated souls).&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''dharma'' &amp; ''adharma'' ''dravyas'' are present only in ''Lokakasha'' and that is why  ''jiva'' and ''pudgal'' are also there in the ''Lokakasha'' only.&lt;ref&gt;http://jainascience.blogspot.in/2007/12/six-substancesdravyas-in-jain.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;http://mangitungi.org/JainismNScience.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alokakasha ===
The (empty) infinite space outside the universe is called the non-universe (alokakash). In the non-universe, space alone exists without the other five substances. Actually in non-universe there is nothing but space.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jainbooks/firstep-1/dravya.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Alokakash is perceptible only to the omniscient.

{{Hindu philosophy}}

{{Buddhism}}
{{Jainism}}

'''Āstika''' (Sanskrit आस्तिक IAST: āstika) derives from the Sanskrit ''asti'', "there is, there exists", and means “one who believes in the existence (of God, of another world, etc.)” and '''nāstika''' means "an atheist or unbeliever" &lt;ref name="MW" /&gt;. These have been concepts used to classify [[Indian philosophies]] by modern scholars, and some [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Jainism|Jaina]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Perrett (2000), Indian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, page 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sushil Mittal &amp; Gene Thursby (2004), The Hindu World, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415772273}}, pages 729-730&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Flood: "These schools [such as Buddhism and Jainism] are understandably regarded as heterodox (''nāstika'') by orthodox (''āstika'') Brahmanism."{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=82}}}} ''Āstika'' has been defined in one of three ways; as those who accept the [[Pramana|epistemic]] authority of the [[Vedas]], as those who accept the existence of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]], or as those who accept the existence of ''[[Ishvara]]''.&lt;ref name="andrew"&gt;Andrew J. Nicholson (2013), [[Unifying Hinduism|Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History]], Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gsghurye&gt;[[G.

The various definitions for ''āstika'' and ''nāstika'' philosophies has been disputed since ancient times, and there is no consensus.&lt;ref name="andrew" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wendy"&gt;Wendy Doniger (2014), On Hinduism, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199360079}}, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]] is considered to be ''nāstika'', but the [[Gautama Buddha]] is considered an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] in some Hindu traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Literature review of secondary references of Buddha as Dashavatara which regard Buddha to be part of standard list:

&lt;/ref&gt;
The most studied Āstika schools of Indian philosophies, sometimes referred to as [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] schools, are six: [[Nyaya|Nyāyá]], [[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]], [[Samkhya|Sāṃkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]], and [[Vedanta|Vedānta]]. The most studied Nāstika schools of Indian philosophies, sometimes referred to as [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] schools, are four: [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Cārvāka]], and [[Ājīvika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=82, 224–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of this method of classification, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: {{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; This orthodox-heterodox terminology is a construct of Western languages, and lacks scholarly roots in Sanskrit. Recent scholarly studies&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt; state that there have been various [[Heresiology|heresiological]] translations of Āstika and Nāstika in 20th century literature on Indian philosophies, but quite many are unsophisticated and flawed.

Astika and Nāstika do not mean "theism" and "atheism" respectively in ancient or medieval era Sanskrit literature.&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt; In current Indian languages like [[Hindi]], ''āstika'' and its derivatives usually mean "[[theism|theist]]", while ''nāstika'' and its derivatives denote an "[[atheism|atheist]].”&lt;ref&gt;For [http://www.iheu.org/node/185 instance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418105244/http://www.iheu.org/node/185 |date=18 April 2007 }}, the "Atheist Society of India" produces a monthly publications ''Nastika Yuga'', which it translates as "The Age of Atheism".&lt;/ref&gt; However, the terms are used differently in Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Chatterjee |first1=Satischandra |last2=Datta |first2=Dhirendramohan |title=An Introduction to Indian Philosophy |edition=Eighth Reprint |publisher=University of Calcutta |year=1984|pages=5, footnote 1|quote=In modern Indian languages, "āstika" and "nāstika" generally mean "theist" and "atheist,” respectively.  But in Sanskrit philosophical literature, "āstika" means "one who believes in the authority of the Vedas".  ("nāstika" means the opposite of these). The word is used here in the first sense. The six orthodox schools are "āstika", and the Cārvāka is "nāstika" in both the senses.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Sāṃkhya'' is both an atheist and ''āstika'' (Vedic) philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;"By {{IAST|Sāṃkhya}} reasoning, the material principle itself simply evolves into complex forms, and there is no need to hold that some spiritual power governs the material principle or its ultimate source."  Francis Clooney, CJ, "''Restoring 'Hindu Theology' as a category in Indian intellectual discourse", in {{cite book|author=Francis Clooney|editor=Gavin Flood|title=The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKBxa-MNqA8C |year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Academic|isbn=978-0-470-99868-7|pages=451–455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
''Āstika'' is a [[Sanskrit]] adjective (and noun) that is derived from ''asti'' ("there is or exists").&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{harvnb|Monier-Williams|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "knowing that which exists" or "pious";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apte|1965|pp=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nāstika'' (''na'' (not) + ''{{IAST|āstika}}'') is its negative.

One of the traditional etymologies of the term ''āstika''–based on [[Pāṇini#Aṣṭādhyāyī|Pāṇini's ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'']],
4.4.60 ("astināstidiṣṭam matiḥ") says ‘he whose opinion is that [[Ishvara|Īśvara]] exists’ ("asti īśvara iti matir yasya").&lt;ref name="SquarciniSquarcini2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Squarcini|first1=Federico|last2=Squarcini|first2=Federico|title=Traditions against Tradition. Criticism, Dissent and the Struggle for the Semiotic Primacy of Veridiction|year=2012|pages=446|doi=10.7135/UPO9781843313977.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions include "opposite of ''nāstika''" (''nāstika bhinna''); "he whose idea is that Īśvara exists" (''īśvara asti iti vādī''); "he who considers the [[Vedas]] as authorities" (''vedaprāmāṇyavādī''). According to Sanskrit grammarian [[Hemachandra]], ''āstika'' is a synonym for ‘he who believes’.{{refn|name=SquarciniSquarcini2012}}

As used in Hindu philosophy, the differentiation between ''āstika'' and ''nāstika'' does not refer to theism or atheism.&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt; The terms often, but not always, relate to accepting Vedic literature as an authority, particularly on their teachings on Self (Soul). The Veda and Hinduism do not subscribe to or include the concept of an almighty that is separate from oneself i.e. there is no concept of God in the [[Christianity|Christian]] or [[Islam]]ic sense. N. N. Bhattacharya writes:
{{quote|The followers of Tantra were often branded as Nāstika by the political proponents of the Vedic tradition.  The term Nāstika does not denote an atheist since the Veda presents a godless system with no singular almighty being or multiple almighty beings.  It is applied only to those who do not believe in the Vedas.  The {{IAST| Sāṃkhya}}s and {{IAST|Mīmāṃsaka}}s do not believe in God, but they believe in the Vedas and hence they are not Nāstikas. The Buddhists, Jains, and Cārvākas do not believe in the Vedas; hence they are Nāstikas.|{{harvnb|Bhattacharyya|1999|pp=174}}}}

Āstika is also a name, such as that of a Vedic scholar born to the goddess [[Manasa|Mānasā]] ("Mind") and the sage [[Jaratkaru]].&lt;ref&gt;George Williams (2003), Handbook of Hindu Mythology, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195332612}}, page 65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification of schools ==

The terms Āstika and Nāstika have been used to classify various Indian intellectual traditions.

=== Āstika Hindu ===

A list of six systems or ''ṣaḍdarśana''s (also spelled ''Sad Darshan'') consider [[Vedas]] as a reliable source of knowledge and an authoritative source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=231–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]] and [[Vedanta]] schools of Hinduism, and they are classified as the ''āstika'' schools:

# Nyāyá, the school of logic
# Vaiśeṣika, the [[atomism|atomist school]]
# Sāṃkhya, the enumeration school
# Yoga, the school of Patañjali (which assumes the metaphysics of Sāṃkhya)
# Mīmāṃsā, the tradition of Vedic exegesis
# Vedanta or Uttara Mimāṃsā, the [[Upanishad|Upaniṣad]]ic tradition.

These are often coupled into three groups for both historical and conceptual reasons: Nyāyá-Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya-Yoga, and Mimāṃsā-Vedanta.

=== Nāstika Hindu ===

The main schools of Indian philosophy that reject the [[Vedas]] were regarded as heterodox in the Brahmanical tradition:{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=82}}

# [[Buddhism]]
# [[Jainism]]
# [[Cārvāka]]
# [[Ājīvika]]
# [[Ajñana]]

The use of the term ''nāstika'' to describe Buddhism and Jainism in India is explained by Gavin Flood as follows:

{{quote|At an early period, during the formation of the Upaniṣads and the rise of Buddhism and Jainism, we must envisage a common heritage of meditation and mental discipline practiced by renouncers with varying affiliations to non-orthodox (Veda-rejecting) and orthodox (Veda-accepting) traditions.... These schools [such as Buddhism and Jainism] are understandably regarded as heterodox (''nāstika'') by orthodox (''āstika'') Brahmanism.|Gavin Flood&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tantra|Tantric traditions]] in Hinduism have both ''āstika'' and ''nāstika'' lines; as Banerji writes in "''Tantra in Bengal''":

{{quote|Tantras are ... also divided as ''āstika'' or Vedic and ''nāstika'' or non-Vedic.  In accordance with the predominance of the deity the ''āstika'' works are again divided as {{IAST|Śākta, Śaiva, Saura, Gāṇapatya and Vaiṣṇava}}.|Banerji&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Banerji|1992|pp= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Discussion ==

=== Hinduism ===

Manusmriti, in verse 2.11, defines Nāstika as those who revile "Vedic literature based on two roots of science of reasoning ([[Śruti]] and Smriti)".&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt; The 9th century Indian scholar Medhatithi analyzed this definition and stated that Nāstika does not mean someone who says "Vedic literature are untrue", but rather one who says "Vedic literature are immoral". Medhatithi further noted verse 8.309 of Manusmriti, to provide another aspect of the definition of Nāstika as one who believes, "there is no other world, there is no purpose in giving [[Dāna|charity]], there is no purpose in rituals and the teachings in the Vedic literature."&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt;

Manusmriti does not define, or imply a definition for Astika. It is also silent or contradictory on specific rituals such as animal sacrifices, asserting [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence, non-injury) is [[dharma]] in its verses such as verse 10.63 based on Upanishadic layer of Vedic literature, even though the older layer of Vedic literature mention such sacrifices unlike the later layer of Vedic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: [https://archive.org/stream/manusmriti/manusmriti_six_commentaries#page/n1333/mode/2up Manusmriti with six scholar commentaries] VN Mandlik, page 1310&lt;br&gt;English: [http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/quotes/manu-smriti-10-63 Manusmriti 10.63] Berkeley Center for World Religion, Peace and World Affairs, Georgetown University&lt;/ref&gt; Indian scholars, such as those from Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya and Vedanta schools, accepted Astika to be those that include ''Śabda'' (शब्द, ''Aptavacana'', testimony of Vedic literature and reliable experts) as a reliable means of [[epistemology]], but they accepted the later ancient layer of the Vedic literature to be superseding the earlier ancient layer.&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt;

==== Definition without reference to Vedas ====

In contrast to Manusmiriti, the 6th century CE Jain scholar and doxographer [[Haribhadra]], provided a different perspective in his writings on Astika and Nāstika. Haribhadra did not consider "reverence for Vedas" as a marker for an Astika. He and other 1st millennium CE Jaina scholars defined Astika as one who "affirms there exists another world, transmigration exists, virtue (''punya'') exists, vice (''paap'') exists".&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt;&lt;ref name=wendy/&gt;

The 7th century scholars Jayaditya and Vamana, in ''[[Kāśikāvṛttī|Kasikavrtti]]'' of Pāṇini tradition, were silent on the role of or authority of Vedic literature in defining Astika and Nāstika. They state, "Astika is the one who believes there exists another world. The opposite of him is the Nāstika."&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Haag and V. Vergiani (Eds., 2009), Studies in the Kāśikāvṛtti, Firenze : Società Editrice Fiorentina, {{ISBN|978-8860321145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly the widely studied 2nd-3rd century CE Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]], in Chapter 1 verses 60-61 of Ratnāvalī, wrote [[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]] and [[Samkhya|Sāṃkhya]] schools of Hinduism were Nāstika, along with Jainism, his own school of Buddhism and Pudgalavadins (Vātsīputrīya) school of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Dressler and Arvind Mandair (2011), Secularism and Religion-Making, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199782949}}, page 59 note 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Steinkellner (1991), Studies in the Buddhist Epistemological Tradition: Proceedings of the Second International Dharmakīrti Conference, Vienna, Volume 222, Austrian Academy of Sciences Press, {{ISBN|978-3700119159}}, pages 230-238&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Definition based on belief in Atman ====

Astika, in some texts, is defined as those who believe in the existence of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'' (Soul, Self, Spirit), while Nastika being those who deny there is any "soul, self" in human beings and other living beings.&lt;ref name=gsghurye/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C Sharma (2013), A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803657}}, page 66&lt;/ref&gt; All six schools of Hinduism classified as Astika philosophies hold the premise, "Atman exists". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, "Atman does not exist".&lt;ref&gt;Dae-Sook Suh (1994), Korean Studies: New Pacific Currents, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824815981}}, page 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnplott3&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, page 63, Quote: "The Buddhist schools reject any Ātman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism".&lt;/ref&gt; Asanga Tilakaratna translates Astika as "positivism" and Nastika as "negativism", with Astika illustrated by Brahmanic traditions who accepted "soul and God exists", while Nastika as those traditions, such as Buddhism, who denied "soul and God exists".&lt;ref&gt;Asanga Tilakaratna (2003, Editors: Anne Blackburn and Jeffrey Samuels), Approaching the Dhamma: Buddhist Texts and Practices in South and Southeast Asia, Pariyatti, {{ISBN|978-1928706199}}, pages 128-129;&lt;br&gt;God, states Tilakaratna, in Brahmanic traditions is ''Parama-atma'' (universal soul, [[Ishvara]], Brahman)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jainism ===

According to [[G. S. Ghurye]], the Jain texts define "na+astika" as one "denying what exists" or any school of philosophy that denies the existence of the soul.&lt;ref name=pillai353&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Devadas Pillai|title=Indian Sociology Through Ghurye, a Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3uD22Ghqs4C&amp;pg=PA354|year=1997|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7154-807-1|pages=353–354}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedanta sub-traditions of Hinduism are "astika" because they accept the existence of soul, while Buddhist traditions denying this are referred to as "nastika".&lt;ref name=pillai353/&gt;

One of the earliest mentions of ''astika'' concept in Jain texts is by [[Manibhadra]], who states that an ''astika'' is one who "accepts there exist another world (''paraloka''), transmigration of soul, virtue and vice that affect how a soul journeys through time".&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p172"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew J. Nicholson|title=Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVusAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14987-7|pages=172–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5th–6th century Jainism scholar [[Haribhadra]], states Andrew Nicholson, does not mention anything about accepting or rejecting the Vedas or god as a criterion for being an ''astika'' or ''nastika''. Instead, Haribhadra explains ''nastika'' in the manner of the more ancient Jain scholar Manibhadra, by stating a nastika to be one "who says there is no other worlds, there is no purpose in charity, there is no purpose in offerings".&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p172"/&gt; An ''astika'', to Haribhadra, is one who believes that there is a purpose and merit in an ethical life such as ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) and ritual actions.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p172"/&gt; This exposition of the word ''astika'' and ''nastika'' by Haribhadra is similar to one by the Sanskrit grammarian and Hindu scholar Pāṇini in section 4.4.60 of the ''Astadhyayi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew J. Nicholson|title=Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVusAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14987-7|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12th century Jaina scholar [[Hemachandra]] similarly states, in his text ''Abhidhana Cintamani'', that a ''nastika'' is any philosophy that presumes or argues there is "no virtue and vice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramkrishna Bhattacharya|title=Studies on the Carvaka/Lokayata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59eygxzQTWQC&amp;pg=PA164|year=2011|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-0-85728-433-4|pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buddhism ===

[[Nagarjuna]], according to Chandradhar Sharma, equates ''Nastikya'' to "nihilism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chandradhar Sharma|title=A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3gQVd5WogsC|year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0365-7|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th century Buddhist scholar [[Asanga]], in ''Bodhisattva Bhumi'', calls ''nastika Buddhists'' as ''sarvavai nasika'', describing them as who are complete deniers. To Asanga, ''nastika'' are those who say "nothing whatsoever exists", and the worst kind of ''nastika'' are those who deny all designation and reality.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew J. Nicholson|title=Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVusAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14987-7|pages=174–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astika are those who accept merit in and practice a religious life.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"/&gt; According to Andrew Nicholson, later Buddhists understood Asanga to be targeting [[Madhyamaka]] Buddhism as ''nastika'', while considering his own Yogacara Buddhist tradition to be ''astika''.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"/&gt; Initial interpretations of the Buddhist texts with the term ''astika'' and ''nastika'', such as those composed by Nagarjuna and Asvaghosa, were interpreted as being directed at the Hindu traditions. But, states John Kelly, most later scholarship considers this as incorrect, and that the ''astika'' and ''nastika'' terms were directed towards the competing Buddhist traditions and the intended audience of the texts were Buddhist monks debating an array of ideas across various Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John D Kelly|editor=Jan E. M. Houben|title=Ideology and Status of Sanskrit: Contributions to the History of the Sanskrit Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_eqr833q9qYC&amp;pg=PA88|year=1996|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-10613-8|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charges of being a ''nastika'' were serious threat to the social standing of a Buddhist, and could lead to expulsion from Buddhist monastic community. Thus, states Nicholson, the colonial era Indologist definition of astika and nastika schools of Indian philosophy, was based on a narrow study of literature such as a version of ''[[Manusmriti]]'', while in truth these terms are more complex and contextually apply within the diverse schools of Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"/&gt;

The most common meaning of astika and nastika, in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism was the acceptance and adherence to ethical premises, and not textual validity or doctrinal premises, states Nicholson. It is likely that astika was translated as orthodox, and nastika as heterodox, because the early European Indologists carried the baggage of Christian theological traditions and extrapolated their own concepts to Asia, thereby distorting the complexity of Indian traditions and thought.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"/&gt;
