[[Image:Aeolipile illustration.png|thumb|An illustration of Hero's aeolipile]]
An '''aeolipile''' (or '''aeolipyle''', or '''eolipile'''), also known as a '''Hero's engine''', is a simple bladeless [[radial turbine|radial steam turbine]] which spins when the central water container is heated. Torque is produced by steam jets exiting the turbine, much like a [[tip jet]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/J/jet_engine.html jet engine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or rocket engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/TRC/Rockets/history_of_rockets.html NASA Glenn Learning Technologies Project (LTP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century AD, [[Hero of Alexandria]] described the device in [[Roman Egypt]], and many sources give him the credit for its invention.&lt;ref name="HeroSteamEngine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Herons von Alexandria Druckwerke und Automatentheater|author-last=Hero|author-link=Hero of Alexandria|others=Wilhelm Schmidt (translator)|place=Leipzig|publisher=B.G. Teubner|date=1899|language =Greek, German|url=https://archive.org/stream/heronsvonalexandhero#page/228/mode/2up|pages=228–232|chapter=Pneumatika, Book II, Chapter XI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aeolipile Hero described is considered to be the first recorded [[steam engine]] or reaction [[steam turbine]].&lt;ref&gt;"turbine." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 18 July 2007 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-45691&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The name – derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word Αἴολος and [[Latin]] word ''pila'' – translates to "the ball of [[Aeolus]]", Aeolus being the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] of the air and wind.

Pre-dating Heron's writings, a device called an aeolipile was described in the 1st century BC by [[Vitruvius]] in his treatise ''[[De architectura]]''; however, it is unclear if it is the same device or a predecessor, as he does not mention rotating parts.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius"/&gt;

==Description and physics==
[[Image:Herosenginesmall.jpg|thumb|A classroom model of an aeolipile]]
The aeolipile consists of a vessel, usually a "simple" [[solid of revolution]], such as a [[sphere]] or a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], arranged to rotate on its axis, having oppositely bent or curved [[nozzle]]s projecting from it ([[tipjets]]). When the vessel is pressurized with steam, steam is expelled through the nozzles, which generates thrust due to the [[rocket engine|rocket]] principle&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/aeolipile.html Aeolipile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as a consequence of the 2nd and 3rd of [[Newton's laws of motion]]. When the nozzles, pointing in different directions, produce forces along different lines of action perpendicular to the axis of the [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], the thrusts combine to result in a rotational moment (mechanical [[Couple (mechanics)|couple]]), or [[torque]], causing the vessel to spin about its axis. Aerodynamic drag and frictional forces in the bearings build up quickly with increasing rotational speed ([[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]) and consume the accelerating torque, eventually cancelling it and achieving a [[steady state]] speed.

Typically, and as Heron described the device, the water is heated in a simple [[boiler]] which forms part of a stand for the rotating vessel. Where this is the case, the boiler is connected to the rotating chamber by a pair of pipes that also serve as the [[wiktionary:Pivot|pivot]]s for the chamber. Alternatively the rotating chamber may itself serve as the boiler, and this arrangement greatly simplifies the pivot/bearing arrangements, as they then do not need to pass steam. This can be seen in the illustration of a classroom model to the right.

==History==
[[File:Aeolipile (from Pneumatica).jpg|thumb|right|Illustration from Hero's ''Pneumatica'']]
Both Heron and Vitruvius draw on the much earlier work by [[Ctesibius]] (285–222 BC), Ctesibius or Ktesibios or Tesibius was an inventor and mathematician in [[Alexandria]], [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]]. He wrote the first treatises on the science of compressed air and its uses in pumps.

===Vitruvius's description===
[[Vitruvius]] (c. 80 BC – c. 15 AD) mentions aeolipiles by name:

"Æolipylæ are hollow brazen vessels, which have an opening or mouth of small size, by means of which they can be filled with water.  Prior to the water being heated over the fire, but little wind is emitted. As soon, however, as the water begins to boil, a violent wind issues forth."&lt;ref name="Vitruvius"&gt;''"De Architectura": Chapter VI (paragraph 2)&lt;br /&gt;from "Ten Books on Architecture" by [[Vitruvius]] (1st century BC), published 17, June, 08 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html] accessed 2009-07-07&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heron's description===
Heron (c. 10–70 AD) takes a more practical approach, in that he gives instructions how to make one:

{{quote|№ 50. The Steam-Engine.&lt;br /&gt;
PLACE a cauldron over a fire: a ball shall revolve on a pivot. A fire is lighted under a cauldron, A B, (fig. 50), containing water, and covered at the mouth by the lid C D; with this the bent tube E F G communicates, the extremity of the tube being fitted into a hollow ball, H K. Opposite to the extremity G place a pivot, L M, resting on the lid C D; and let the ball contain two bent pipes, communicating with it at the opposite extremities of a diameter, and bent in opposite directions, the bends being at right angles and across the lines F G, L M. As the cauldron gets hot it will be found that the steam, entering the ball through E F G, passes out through the bent tubes towards the lid, and causes the ball to revolve, as in the case of the dancing figures.&lt;ref name="HeroSteamEngine"/&gt;}}

==Practical usage==
[[Image:aeolipile.jpg|thumb|right|A modern replica of Hero's aeolipile]]
It is not known whether the aeolipile was put to any practical use in ancient times, and if it was seen as a pragmatic device, a whimsical novelty, an object of reverence, or some other thing. A source described it as a mere curiosity for the ancient Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blazing the Trail: The Early History of Spacecraft and Rocketry|last=Gruntman|first=Mike|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=156347705X|location=Reston, VA|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hero's drawing shows a standalone device, and was presumably intended as a "temple wonder," like many of the other devices described in ''[[Pneumatica]]''{{what|date=April 2017}}.&lt;ref name = "HeroSteamEngine"&gt;{{citation | title = Pneumatica | chapter = Section 50 – The Steam Engine | author = Hero | place = Alexandria | date = 1851 | origyear = reprint of 1st century CE original | publisher = Taylor Walton and Maberly | publication-place = London | chapter-url =http://himedo.net/TheHopkinThomasProject/TimeLine/Wales/Steam/URochesterCollection/Hero/section50.html | accessdate = 2009-07-03}}   Translated from the original Greek by Bennet Woodcroft '' (Professor of Machinery in [[University College London]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitruvius, on the other hand, mentions use of the aeolipile for demonstrating the physical properties of the weather. He describes the aeolipile as
{{quote|…a scientific invention [to] discover a divine truth lurking in the laws of the heavens.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius" /&gt;}}
After describing the device's construction (see above) he concludes:
{{quote|…Thus from this slight and very short experiment we may understand and judge the mighty and wonderful laws of the heavens and the nature of winds.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius" /&gt;}}In 1543, [[Blasco de Garay]], a scientist and a captain in the Spanish navy, demonstrated before the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V]] and a committee of high officials an invention he claimed could propel large ships in the absence of wind using an apparatus consisted of copper boiler and moving wheels on either side of the ship.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Innovation and Technological Diffusion: An economic history of early steam engines|last=Kitsikopoulos|first=Harry|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781138948112|location=Oxon|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This account was preserved by the royal Spanish archives at [[Simancas]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Floating Palaces of the Great Lakes: A History of Passenger Steamships on the Inland Seas|last=Stone|first=Joe|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2015|isbn=9780472071753|location=Ann Arbor|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that de Garay used Hero's aeolipile and combined it with the technology used in Roman boats and late medieval galleys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Here, de Garay's invention introduced an innovation where the aeolipile had practical usage, which was to generate motion to the paddlewheels, demonstrating the feasibility of steam-driven boats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Allegany College of Maryland''' (or '''ACM''') is a two-year public community college located in [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], [[Maryland]]. It was previously known as '''Allegany Community College''' (or '''ACC''').

== History ==

Allegany College of Maryland began operations in 1961 as "Allegany Community College" in an old public school facility (the segregationist era all-black Carver Community School) that had been closed by the Allegany County Board of Education. The College opened with an enrollment of 122 students from Allegany County under the direction of ACM’s first president, Dr. Robert S. Zimmer.

In 1969, the College moved to a new campus consisting of seven buildings on a 316-acre (1.3&amp;nbsp;km²) tract in suburban Cumberland that was partially funded by the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]]. Enrollment reached the 1000 mark in credit programs during the first year on the new campus and community service and continuing education courses and programs began. Since that time, the campus has expanded to include 15 buildings, which provide modern facilities for both credit and non-credit students.

The College opened two Pennsylvania campuses in 1989 ([[Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Somerset County]] Campus in [[Somerset, Pennsylvania]]) and 1990 ([[Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Bedford County]] Campus in [[Everett, Pennsylvania]]). It expanded its Hospitality Management and Culinary Arts programs into the Gateway Center located in downtown Cumberland in 2002.

The College now serves over 3,700 credit students and over 15,000 continuing education registrations. Over 1,000 of these credit students are served at the Pennsylvania campuses.

On January 17, 2017 it was announced that the Somerset location will close following the Spring 2017 semester.

== Programs ==
[[File:Allegany College bell tower MD1.jpg|thumb|Allegany College bell tower]]
The College offers over 53 associate degrees, 23 certificates, and 21 letters of recognition.

== Athletics ==
The College's men's baseball and basketball teams have been consistently ranked in the top 20 of their respective [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA) Divisions. The baseball team participated in the NJCAA national tournaments nine times, including a four-year run from 1994-1997. The men's basketball team has participated twelve times in the NJCAA national tournament in 1995-96 (finished 2nd), 1997–98, 2000–01 (finished 2nd), 2001–02, 2003–04 and 2007–08.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electroniccampus.org/CampusTour/undergraduate/1256/Allegany_College_of_Maryland/Allegany_College_of_Maryland1.html Electronic Campus - Select a College - Campus Tours - Allegany College of Maryland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance and accreditation ==
The [[Maryland Higher Education Commission]] (MHEC) oversees and coordinates higher education in the State of Maryland including academic and financial policies at the College. An eight-member Board of Trustees, appointed by the [[Governor of Maryland|Governor of the State of Maryland]], governs the College. The College also has an advisory board for each of its two Pennsylvania Campuses—the Bedford County Campus Advisory Committee ([[Bedford County, Pennsylvania]]) and the Somerset County Campus Advisory Committee ([[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]]).

The college is a member of the [[Maryland Association of Community Colleges]] (MACC) and is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education, [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]]. The College is also accredited and approved for operation by MHEC. The [[Pennsylvania Department of Education]] has granted certification to Allegany College of Maryland campuses in Bedford and Somerset counties and to the academic programs they offer.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8256">An '''allele-specific oligonucleotide''' ('''ASO''') is a short piece of synthetic [[DNA]] complementary to the sequence of a variable target DNA. It acts as a [[Hybridization probe|probe]] for the presence of the target in a [[Southern blot]] assay or, more commonly, in the simpler [[Dot blot]] assay. It is a common tool used in [[genetic testing]], [[forensics]], and [[Molecular Biology]] research.

An ASO is typically an [[oligonucleotide]] of 15–21 [[nucleotide|nucleotide bases]] in length. It is designed (and used) in a way that makes it specific for only one version, or [[allele]], of the DNA being tested. The length of the ASO, which strand it is chosen from, and the conditions by which it is [[Nucleic acid hybridization|bound to]] (and washed from) the target DNA all play a role in its specificity. These probes can usually be designed to detect a difference of as little as 1 base in the target's genetic sequence, a basic ability in the assay of [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs), important in [[genotype|genotype analysis]] and the [[Human Genome Project]]. To be detected after it has bound to its target, the ASO must be labeled with a radioactive, enzymatic, or fluorescent tag. The [[Illumina Methylation Assay]] technology takes advantage of ASO to detect one base pair difference (cytosine versus thymine) to measure methylation at a specific CpG site.

==Example==
[[File:Allele-specific oligonucleotide (sample).jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Binding of the "S" ASO probe to "S" DNA (top) or "A" DNA (bottom).&lt;/center&gt;]]
The human disease [[sickle-cell disease|sickle cell anemia]] is caused by a genetic [[mutation]] in the [[codon]] for the sixth [[amino acid]] of the blood protein [[HBB|beta-hemoglobin]]. The normal DNA sequence G-A-G codes for the amino acid [[glutamate]], while the mutation changes the middle [[adenine]] to a [[thymine]], leading to the sequence G-T-G (G-U-G in the [[messenger RNA|mRNA]]). This altered sequence substitutes a [[valine]] into the final protein, distorting its structure.

To test for the presence of the mutation in a DNA sample, an ASO probe would be synthesized to be complementary to the altered sequence,&lt;ref name="Studencki"&gt;Studencki AB, Conner BJ, Impraim CC, Teplitz RL, and Wallace RB "Discrimination among the human beta A, beta S, and beta C-globin genes using allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization probes." Am J Hum Genet vol. 37(1), pp. 42–51 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; here labeled as "S". As a control, another ASO would be synthesized for the normal sequence "A". Each ASO is fully complementary to its target sequence (and will bind strongly), but has a single mismatch against its non-target allele (leading to weaker interaction). The first diagram shows how the "S" probe is fully complementary to the "S" target (top), but is partially mismatched against the "A" target (bottom).

[[image:DotBlotDemo.jpg|right|thumb|350px|&lt;center&gt;Schematic of dot-blots using the "A" or "S" ASO probes.&lt;/center&gt;]]
A segment of the beta-hemoglobin genes in the sample DNA(s) would be amplified by PCR, and the resulting products applied to duplicate support membranes as [[Dot blot]]s. The sample's DNA strands are separated with alkali, and each ASO probe is applied to a different blot. After hybridization, a washing protocol is used which can discriminate between the fully complementary and the mismatched hybrids. The mismatched ASOs are washed off of the blots, while the matched ASOs (and their labels) remain.

In the second diagram, six samples of amplified DNA have been applied to each of the two blots. [[Autoradiography|Detection]] of the ASO label that remains after washing allows a direct reading of the [[genotype]] of the samples, each with two copies of the beta-hemoglobin gene. Samples 1 and 4 only have the normal "A" allele, while samples 3 and 5 have both the "A" and "S" alleles (and are therefore [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|heterozygous]] [[Genetic carrier|carriers]] of this [[Dominance relationship#Recessive allele|recessive mutation]]). Samples 2 and 6 have only the "S" allele, and would be affected by the disease. The small amount of 'cross hybridization' shown is typical, and is considered in the process of interpreting the final results.

==Alternatives==
ASO analysis is only one of the methods used to detect genetic polymorphisms. Direct [[DNA sequencing]] is used to initially characterize the mutation, but is too laborious for routine screening. An earlier method, [[Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism]] (RFLP) didn't need to know the sequence change beforehand, but required that the mutation affect the cleavage site of a [[Restriction Enzyme]]. The RFLP assay was briefly adapted to the use of oligonucleotide [[Oligomer restriction|probes]],&lt;ref name="Saiki1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/ebind2html/pcr/034 |title=Enzymatic amplification of beta-globin genomic sequences and restriction site analysis for diagnosis of sickle cell anemia |last=Saiki |first=RK |author2=Scharf S |author3=Faloona F |author4=Mullis KB |author5=Horn GT |author6=Erlich HA |author7=Arnheim N |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=20 Dec 1985 |volume=230 |issue=4732 |pages=1350–4 |doi=10.1126/science.2999980 |pmid=2999980 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this technique was quickly supplanted by ASO analysis of [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) amplified DNA. The PCR technique itself has been adapted to detect polymorphisms, as [[Variants of PCR|allele-specific PCR]]. However, the simplicity and versatility of the combined PCR/ASO method has led to its continued use, including with non-radioactive labels, and in a "reverse dot blot" format where the ASO probes are bound to the membrane and the amplified sample DNA is used for [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]].

==History==
The use of synthetic oligonucleotides as specific probes for genetic sequence variations was pioneered by R. Bruce Wallace, working at the [[City of Hope National Medical Center]] in [[Duarte, California]]. In 1979 Wallace and his coworkers reported the use of ASO probes to detect variations in a single-stranded bacterial virus,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace RB, Shaffer J, Murphy RF, Bonner J, Hirose T, and Itakura K "Hybridization of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides to Phi-X 174 DNA: the effect of single base pair mismatch." Nucleic Acids Research, vol. 6(11), pp. 3543–3558 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and later applied the technique to cloned human genes. In 1983&lt;ref&gt;Conner BJ, Reyes AA, Morin C, Itakura K, Teplitz RL, and Wallace RB "Detection of sickle cell beta S-globin allele by hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotides." Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. vol. 80(1), pp. 278–282 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; and 1985&lt;ref name="Studencki"/&gt; Wallace's lab reported the detection of the mutation for [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell anemia]] in samples of whole genomic DNA, although this application was hampered by the small amount of label that could be carried by the ASO.&lt;ref name="Studencki"/&gt;

Fortunately PCR, a method to greatly amplify a specific segment of DNA, was also reported in 1985.&lt;ref name="Saiki1"/&gt; In less than a year PCR had been paired with ASO analysis.&lt;ref name="Saiki2"&gt;Saiki RK, Bugawan TL, Horn GT, Mullis KB, and Erlich HE "Analysis of enzymatically amplified beta-globin and HLA-DQ DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes" Nature vol. 324(6093) pp. 163–166 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; This combination solved the problem of ASO labeling, since the amount of target DNA could be amplified over a million-fold. Also, the specificity of the PCR process itself could be added to that of the ASO probes, greatly reducing the problem of spurious binding of the ASO to non-target sequences. The combination was specific enough that it could be used in a simple [[Dot blot]], avoiding the laborious and inefficient [[Southern blot]] method.

An '''anal piercing''' is a [[body piercing]] in the surrounding area of the [[human anus]], usually the [[perineum]].&lt;ref name="Angel2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elayne Angel|title=The Piercing Bible: The Definitive Guide to Safe Body Piercing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=83sjmTPnz48C&amp;pg=PA25|date=16 February 2011|publisher=Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony|isbn=978-0-307-77791-1|pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name, piercing of the anal sphincter itself is rather rare. Some report difficulty cleaning the area after defecation and increases chances of infection.&lt;ref name="Angel2011"/&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]] the minimum age for an anal piercing is 16 enacted in the Sexual Offense Act of 2003.&lt;ref name="Allen2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Allen|title=Age Restricted Sales: The Law in England and Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2GBDCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA178|date=28 October 2015|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1-78462-419-4|pages=178–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, anal piercings have been used as a form of humiliation.&lt;ref name="Stoichita2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16056">'''Area studies''' (also '''regional studies''') are [[interdisciplinary]] fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular [[geography|geographical]], [[nation]]al/[[Federal government|federal]], or [[culture|cultural]] regions.  The term exists primarily as a general description for what are, in the practice of scholarship, many heterogeneous fields of research, encompassing both the [[social sciences]] and the [[humanities]]. Typical area study programs involve [[history]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[cultural studies]], [[languages]], [[geography]], [[literature]], and related disciplines. In contrast to cultural studies, area studies often include [[diaspora]] and [[emigration]] from the area.

==History==
[[Interdisciplinary]] area studies became increasingly common in the [[United States of America]] and in Western scholarship after World War II. Before that war American universities had just a few faculty who taught or conducted research on the non-Western world. Foreign-area studies were virtually nonexistent. After the war, liberals and conservatives alike were concerned about the U.S. ability to respond effectively to perceived external threats from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] in the context of the emerging [[Cold War]], as well as to the fall-out from the [[Decolonisation of Africa|Decolonization of Africa]] and [[decolonisation of Asia|Asia]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

{{Double image|right|Diploma_de_Especialista_Universitario_de_la_Universidad_Complutense_de_Madrid.jpg|200px|Diploma-licenciatura-estudos-europeus-universidade.jpg|200px|[[Latin American studies]] and [[European studies]] are examples of Area studies, offered both in [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] degrees, the images show examples from [[Complutense University of Madrid]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucm.es/amelat/interes&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Universidade Aberta|Aberta University]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www2.uab.pt/guiainformativo/eng_detailcursos.php?curso=14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this context, the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] convened a series of meetings producing a broad consensus that to address this knowledge deficit, the U.S. must invest in international studies. Therefore, the foundations of the field are strongly rooted in America.{{cn|date=August 2017}}  Participants argued that a large brain trust of internationally oriented [[political scientist]]s and [[economist]]s was an urgent national priority. There was a central tension, however, between those who felt strongly that, instead of applying Western models, social scientists should develop culturally and historically contextualized knowledge of various parts of the world by working closely with humanists, and those who thought social scientists should seek to develop overarching [[macrohistory | macrohistorial]] theories that could draw connections between patterns of change and development across different geographies. The former became area-studies advocates, the latter proponents of [[modernization theory]].

The [[Ford Foundation]] would eventually become the dominant player in shaping the area-studies program in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Condliffe Lagemann, ''The Politics of Knowledge: The Carnegie Corporation, Philanthropy, and Public Policy'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the foundation established the prestigious Foreign Area Fellowship Program (FAFP), the first large-scale national competition in support of area-studies training in the United States. From 1953 to 1966 it contributed $270 million to 34 universities for area and language studies. Also during this period, it poured millions of dollars into the committees run jointly by the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] for field-development workshops, conferences, and publication programs.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Szanton, "The Origin, Nature and Challenges of Area Studies in the United States," in ''The Politics of Knowledge: Area Studies and the Disciplines'', ed. David L. Szanton (University of California Press, 2004), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the SSRC-ACLS joint committees would take over the administration of FAFP.

Other large and important programs followed Ford's. Most notably, the [[National Defense Education Act]] of 1957, renamed the Higher Education Act in 1965, allocated funding for some 125 university-based area-studies units known as [[National Resource Center]] programs at U.S. universities, as well as for [[Foreign Language and Area Studies]] fellowships for graduate students.

Meanwhile, area studies were also developed in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;

Others moved from area studies into international journalism. [...] All state and Party organs that dealt with cultural diplomacy drew on the staff of area studies and their network of contacts.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy within the field==
Since their inception, area studies have been subject to criticism—including by area specialists themselves. Many of them alleged that because area studies were connected to the Cold War agendas of the [[CIA]], the [[FBI]], and other intelligence and military agencies, participating in such programs was tantamount to serving as an agent of the state.&lt;ref&gt;See Bruce Cumings, "Boundary Displacement: Area Studies and International Studies during and after the Cold War," in ''Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars'' 29 (1997). http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/cumings2.htm. Retrieved 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that there is the notion that U.S concerns and research priorities will define the intellectual terrain of area studies.&lt;ref&gt;See Patrick O'Meara, "Changing perspectives on international education", (Indiana University Press 2010), pp. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Others insisted, however, that once they were established on university campuses, area studies began to encompass a much broader and deeper intellectual agenda than the one foreseen by government agencies, thus not American centric.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, W.G. 2009. “Area Studies in a Global Context.” Chronicle of Higher Education. Nov 29. http://chronicle.com/article/Area-Studies-in-a-Global-Co/49284/&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, one of the greatest threats to the area studies project was the rise of [[rational choice theory]] in political science and economics.&lt;ref&gt;See "Rational Choice Theory," by John Scott, in ''Understanding Contemporary Society: Theories of The Present'', edited by G. Browning, A. Halcli, and F. Webster (Sage Publications, 2000). {{cite web|url=http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~scottj/socscot7.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227085005/http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~scottj/socscot7.htm |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}. Retrieved 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; To mock one of the most outspoken rational choice theory critics, Japan scholar [[Chalmers Johnson]] asked: Why do you need to know Japanese or anything about Japan's history and culture if the methods of rational choice will explain why Japanese politicians and bureaucrats do the things they do?&lt;ref&gt;See Chalmers Johnson and E. B. Keehn, "A Disaster in the Making: Rational Choice and Asian Studies," ''The National Interest'' 36 (summer 1994), pp. 14–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the demise of the [[Soviet Union]], philanthropic foundations and scientific bureaucracies moved to attenuate their support for area studies, emphasizing instead interregional themes like "development and democracy". When the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]], which had long served as the national [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for raising and administering funds for area studies, underwent their first major restructuring in thirty years, closing down their area committees, scholars interpreted this as a massive signal about the changing research environment.&lt;ref&gt;See Cumings article, cited above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to an increasing interest in studying translocal, transregional, transnational and transcontinental phenomena, a Potsdam-based research network has recently coined the term "TransArea Studies" [http://www.uni-potsdam.de/tapoints/ (POINTS – Potsdam International Network for TransArea Studies)].

Other interdisciplinary research fields such as [[women's studies]] (also known as [[gender studies]]), [[disability studies]], and [[ethnic studies]] (including [[African American studies]], [[Asian American studies]], [[Latino/a studies]], and [[Native American studies]]) are not part of '''area studies''' but are sometimes included in discussion along with it.

==Institutions==

Some entire institutions of higher education (tertiary education) are devoted solely to area studies such as [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], part of the [[University of London]], or the [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]] in Japan. At the [[University of Oxford]], the School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies (SIAS)[http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/][http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/ School of Interdiscplinary Area Studies, Oxford] and [[St Antony's College]] specialise in area studies, and hosts a number of post-graduate teaching programmes and research centres covering various regions of the world.
[[Jawaharlal Nehru University]], New Delhi, is the only institution with immense contribution towards popularising area studies in India.
An institution which exclusively deals with Area Studies is the [[German Institute of Global and Area Studies|GIGA]] (German Institute of Global Area Studies) in Germany.  Additionally, [[Lund University]] in Sweden offers the largest [http://www.ace.lu.se/ Asian Studies] masters program in Northern Europe and is dedicated to promoting studies related to South Asia through its [http://www.sasnet.lu.se/ SASNet].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ace.lu.se/masters-programme/study-asia-in-lund|title=Study Asia in Lund!|author=|date=27 June 2017|website=lu.se|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manifesto ==
The Athens Charter for the Restoration of Historic Monuments was produced by the participants of the First International Congress 
of Architects and Technicians of Historic Monuments organized by the International Museums Office and held in Athens in 1931.
The seven points of the manifesto were:

* to establish organizations for restoration advice
* to ensure projects are reviewed with knowledgeable criticism 
* to establish national legislation to preserve historic sites
* to rebury excavations which were not to be restored. 
* to allow the use of modern techniques and materials in restoration work.
* to place historical sites under custodial protection.
* to protect the area surrounding historic sites.

[[File:captcha.jpg|thumb|This CAPTCHA (Version 1) of "smwm" obscures its message from computer interpretation by twisting the letters and adding slight background color gradient.]]
A '''CAPTCHA''' ({{IPAc-en|k|æ|p|.|tʃ|ə}}, an [[acronym]] for "'''C'''ompletely '''A'''utomated '''P'''ublic [[Turing test|'''T'''uring test]] to tell '''C'''omputers and '''H'''umans '''A'''part") is a type of [[challenge–response authentication|challenge–response]] test used in [[computing]] to determine whether or not the user is human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/partners/success-stories/recaptcha.html|title=The reCAPTCHA Project – Carnegie Mellon University CyLab|website=www.cylab.cmu.edu|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in 2003 by [[Luis von Ahn]], [[Manuel Blum]], Nicholas J. Hopper, and [[John Langford (computer scientist)|John Langford]].&lt;ref name="abhl" /&gt; The most common type of CAPTCHA (displayed as Version 1.0) was first invented in 1997 by two groups working in parallel. The first group consisted of Mark D. Lillibridge, [[Martin Abadi]], [[Krishna Bharat]], and [[Andrei Broder|Andrei Z. Broder]]; the second group consisted of Eran Reshef, [[Gili Raanan]] and Eilon Solan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This form of CAPTCHA requires that the user type the letters of a distorted image, sometimes with the addition of an obscured sequence of letters or digits that appears on the screen. Because the test is administered by a computer, in contrast to the standard Turing test that is administered by a human, a CAPTCHA is sometimes described as a [[reverse Turing test]].

This user identification procedure has received many criticisms, especially from disabled people, but also from other people who feel that their everyday work is slowed down by distorted words that are difficult to read. It takes the average person approximately 10 seconds to solve a typical CAPTCHA.&lt;ref&gt;Bursztein, E., Bethard, S., Fabry, C., Mitchell, J. C., &amp; Jurafsky, D. (n.d.). Retrieved March 30, 2018, from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/burszstein_2010_captcha.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Since the early days of the [[Internet]], users have wanted to make text illegible to computers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first such people could be [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]], posting about sensitive topics to [[Internet forum]]s they thought were being automatically monitored for keywords. To circumvent such filters, they would replace a word with look-alike characters. ''HELLO'' could become {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;{{!}}-{{!}}3{{!}}_{{!}}_()&lt;/code&gt;}} or {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;)-(3££0&lt;/code&gt;}}, as well as numerous other variants, such that a filter could not possibly detect ''all'' of them. This later became known as [[leet]]speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = h2g2 – An Explanation of l33t Speak – Edited Entry|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A787917|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest commercial uses of CAPTCHAs was in the '''Gausebeck-Levchin test'''&lt;!-- per [[WP:MOSBOLD]] since the redirect points to this article --&gt;. In 2000, idrive.com began to protect its signup page&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzbOLm20p6CrUE1SSXp5Zjl2MW8|title=idrive turing signup page|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a CAPTCHA and prepared to file a patent&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzbOLm20p6CrOS1mWEhITGJ4d2s|title=idrive turing patent application|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on this seemingly novel technique. In 2001, [[PayPal]] used such tests as part of a fraud prevention strategy in which they asked humans to "retype distorted text that programs have difficulty recognizing."&lt;ref name=stringham2015&gt;{{cite book |last=Stringham|first1=Edward P |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/private-governance-creating-order-in-economic-and-social-life/oclc/5881934034&amp;referer=brief_results |title=Private Governance : creating order in economic and social life |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2015 |page=105 |isbn=978-0-19-936516-6 |accessdate=2017-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PayPal cofounder and CTO [[Max Levchin]] helped commercialize this early use.

A popular deployment of CAPTCHA technology, reCAPTCHA, was acquired by Google in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teaching computers to read: Google acquires reCAPTCHA|url=https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/teaching-computers-to-read-google.html|website=Google Official Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to preventing bot fraud for its users, Google used reCAPTCHA and CAPTCHA technology to digitize the archives of The New York Times and books from Google Books in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deciphering Old Texts, One Woozy, Curvy Word at a Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/science/29recaptcha.html|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Google has used an image-based CAPTCHA to improve its driverless car data set, identifying objects like trees and crosswalks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You are building a self driving AI without even knowing about it|url=https://hackernoon.com/you-are-building-a-self-driving-ai-without-even-knowing-about-it-62fadbfa5fdf|website=Hacker Noon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics point to the un-witting participation of the end-user in advancing Google's commercial interests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google is Using You|url=https://hackernoon.com/google-is-using-you-recaptcha-hcaptcha-human-protocol-d911ff51a494|website=Hacker Noon}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In response, competitors have emerged with alternative models including compensation for the website host or end-user for their effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=hCaptcha|url=https://hcaptcha.com|website=hCaptcha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inventorship claims ===

Two teams of people have claimed to be the first to invent the CAPTCHAs used widely on the Web today. The first team consists of Mark D. Lillibridge, [[Martín Abadi]], [[Krishna Bharat]], and [[Andrei Broder]], who used CAPTCHAs in 1997 at [[AltaVista]] to prevent [[Internet bot|bots]] from adding [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] to their [[web search engine]]. Looking for a way to make their images resistant to [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] attack, the team looked at the manual of their [[Brother Industries|Brother]] [[Image scanner|scanner]], which had recommendations for improving OCR's results (similar typefaces, plain backgrounds, etc.). The team created puzzles by attempting to simulate what the manual claimed would cause bad OCR.

The second team to claim inventorship of CAPTCHAs consists of [[Luis von Ahn]], Manuel Blum, Nicholas J. Hopper, and John Langford, who first described CAPTCHAs in a 2003 publication&lt;ref name="abhl" /&gt; and subsequently received much coverage in the popular press. Their notion of CAPTCHA covers any program that can distinguish humans from computers, including many different examples of CAPTCHAs.

The controversy of inventorship has been resolved by the existence of a 1997 priority date patent application by Eran Reshef, [[Gili Raanan]] and Eilon Solan&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-03-01|title=Method and system for discriminating a human action from a computerized action|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US20050114705A1/en?q=discriminating&amp;q=human&amp;inventor=raanan}}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked at [[Sanctum (company)|Sanctum]] on [[Web application firewall|Application Security Firewall]]. Their patent application details that "The invention is based on applying human advantage in applying sensory and cognitive skills to solving simple problems that prove to be extremely hard for computer software. Such skills include, but are not limited to processing of sensory information such as identification of objects and letters within a noisy graphical environment"; and a 1998 patent by Lillibridge, Abadi, Bharat, and Broder.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent 6,195,698. Method for selectively restricting access to computer systems. Filed on Apr 13, 1998 and granted on Feb 27, 2001. Available at http://www.google.com/patents/US6195698&lt;/ref&gt; Both patents predate other publications by several years, though they do not use the term CAPTCHA, they describe the ideas in detail and precisely depict the graphical CAPTCHAs used in the Web today.

== Characteristics ==
CAPTCHAs are, by definition, fully automated, requiring little human maintenance or intervention to administer, producing benefits in cost and reliability.

The algorithm used to create the CAPTCHA must be made public, though it may be covered by a patent. This is done to demonstrate that breaking it requires the solution to a difficult problem in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) rather than just the discovery of the (secret) algorithm, which could be obtained through [[reverse engineering]] or other means.

Modern text-based CAPTCHAs are designed such that they require the simultaneous use of three separate abilities—invariant recognition, segmentation, and parsing—to correctly complete the task with any consistency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chellapilla|first=Kumar|first2=Kevin|last2=Larson|first3=Patrice|last3=Simard|first4=Mary|last4=Czerwinski|title=Designing Human Friendly Human Interaction Proofs (HIPs)|journal=Microsoft Research|url=https://research.microsoft.com/pubs/101726/HIPSCHI2005.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410195118/http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/101726/HIPSCHI2005.pdf|archivedate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Invariant recognition refers to the ability to recognize the large amount of variation in the shapes of letters. There are nearly an infinite number of versions for each character that a human brain can successfully identify. The same is not true for a computer, and teaching it to recognize all those differing formations is an extremely challenging task.
# Segmentation, or the ability to separate one letter from another, is also made difficult in CAPTCHAs, as characters are crowded together with no white space in between.
# Context is also critical. The CAPTCHA must be understood holistically to correctly identify each character. For example, in one segment of a CAPTCHA, a letter might look like an "m". Only when the whole word is taken into context does it become clear that it is a "u" and an "n".

Each of these problems poses a significant challenge for a computer, even in isolation. The presence of all three at the same time is what makes CAPTCHAs difficult to solve.&lt;ref name=bursz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bursztein|first=Elie|first2=Matthieu|last2=Martin|first3=John C.|last3=Mitchell |title= Text-based CAPTCHA Strengths and Weaknesses |journal=ACM Computer and Communication Security 2011 (ACM Conference CSS'2011)|year=2011 |series=Stanford University |url=https://www.elie.net/publication/text-based-captcha-strengths-and-weaknesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike computers, humans excel at this type of task. While segmentation and recognition are two separate processes necessary for understanding an image for a computer, they are part of the same process for a person. For example, when an individual understands that the first letter of a CAPTCHA is an "a", that individual also understands where the contours of that "a" are, and also where it melds with the contours of the next letter. Additionally, the human brain is capable of dynamic thinking based upon context. It is able to keep multiple explanations alive and then pick the one that is the best explanation for the whole input based upon contextual clues. This also means it will not be fooled by variations in letters.

== Relation to AI ==
While used mostly for security reasons, CAPTCHAs also serve as a benchmark task for artificial intelligence technologies. According to an article by Ahn, Blum and Langford,&lt;ref name=Ahn2003&gt;von Ahn, L;  M. Blum, N. J. Hopper, and J. Langford. (2003) "CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security". ''Proc. Eurocrypt'', pp. 294–311.
&lt;/ref&gt; "any program that passes the tests generated by a CAPTCHA can be used to solve a hard unsolved AI problem."&lt;ref&gt;Moy G, N Jones and C Harkless (2004) "Distortion estimation techniques in solving visual CAPTCHAs", Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.&lt;/ref&gt;

They argue that the advantages of using hard AI problems as a means for security are twofold. Either the problem goes unsolved and there remains a reliable method for distinguishing humans from computers, or the problem is solved and a difficult AI problem is resolved along with it. In the case of image and text based CAPTCHAs, if an AI were capable of accurately completing the task without exploiting flaws in a particular CAPTCHA design, then it would have solved the problem of developing an AI that is capable of complex [[object recognition]] in scenes.&lt;ref name=Ahn2003/&gt;

== Accessibility ==
{{See also|Web accessibility}}
[[File:FancyCaptcha screenshot.png|left|thumb|260px|Many websites require typing a CAPTCHA when creating an account to prevent spam]]

CAPTCHAs based on reading text — or other visual-perception tasks — prevent [[blindness|blind]] or [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] users from accessing the protected resource.&lt;ref name="w3c_inaccessibility"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/ |title=Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA |date=2005-11-23 |accessdate=2015-04-27 |publisher=[[W3C]] |author=May, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, CAPTCHAs do not have to be visual. Any hard [[artificial intelligence]] problem, such as [[speech recognition]], can be used as the basis of a CAPTCHA. Some implementations of CAPTCHAs permit users to opt for an audio CAPTCHA, though a 2011 paper demonstrated a technique for defeating the popular schemes at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bursztein|first=Elie|first2=Romain|last2=Beauxis|first3=Hristo|last3=Perito|first4=Daniele|last4=Paskov|last5=fabry|first5=Celine|last6=Mitchell|first6=John C.|title=The failure of noise-based non-continuous audio captchas|journal= IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&amp;P), 2011|year=2011|url=https://www.elie.net/publication/the-failure-of-noise-based-non-continuous-audio-captchas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For non-sighted users (for example blind users, or color blind people on a color-using test), visual CAPTCHAs present serious problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Shea, Michael |url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/tech/features/captcha-spambots-ebooks-and-the-turing-test |title=CAPTCHA: Spambots, eBooks and the Turing Test |date=19 November 2015 |publisher=[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]] |accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because CAPTCHAs are designed to be unreadable by machines, common [[assistive technology]] tools such as [[screen readers]] cannot interpret them. Since sites may use CAPTCHAs as part of the initial registration process, or even every login, this challenge can completely block access. In certain jurisdictions, site owners could become targets of litigation if they are using CAPTCHAs that discriminate against certain people with disabilities. For example, a CAPTCHA may make a site incompatible with [[Section 508]] in the United States. In other cases, those with sight difficulties can choose to identify a word being read to them.

While providing an audio CAPTCHA allows blind users to read the text, it still hinders those who are both blind and deaf. According to sense.org.uk, about 4% of people over 60 in the UK have both [[deafblindness|vision and hearing impairments]]. There are about 23,000 people in the UK who have serious vision and hearing impairments. According to The National Technical Assistance Consortium for Children and Young Adults Who Are Deaf-Blind (NTAC), the number of deafblind children in the USA increased from 9,516 to 10,471 during the period 2004 to 2012.&lt;ref name=ncc&gt;{{cite web|title=National Child Count Annual Reports |url=http://nationaldb.org/library/page/2199 |date=November 30, 2012 |work=TA&amp;D Network|publisher=National Consortium on Deaf-Blindness|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallaudet University quotes 1980 to 2007 estimates which suggest upwards of 35,000 fully deafblind adults in the USA.&lt;ref name=dstats&gt;{{cite web |last=Harrington |first=Tom|first2=Jane |last2=Rutherford |title=American deaf-blind population |url=http://libguides.gallaudet.edu/content.php?pid=119476&amp;sid=1029203 |work=Deaf Statistics |publisher=Gallaudet University Library |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deafblind population estimates depend heavily on the degree of impairment used in the definition.

The use of CAPTCHA thus excludes a small number of individuals from using significant subsets of such common Web-based services as PayPal, Gmail, Orkut, Yahoo!, many forum and weblog systems, etc.

Even for perfectly sighted individuals, new generations of graphical CAPTCHAs, designed to overcome sophisticated recognition software, can be very hard or impossible to read.

A method of improving the CAPTCHA to ease the work with it was proposed by ProtectWebForm and was called "Smart CAPTCHA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectwebform.com/smartcaptcha |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104163541/http://protectwebform.com/smartcaptcha |archivedate=2016-11-04 |title=Smart Captcha |publisher=Protect Web Form .COM |date=2006-10-08 |accessdate=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers advise to combine the CAPTCHA with JavaScript support. Since it is too hard for most of spam robots to parse and execute JavaScript, using a simple script which fills the CAPTCHA fields and hides the image and the field from human eyes was proposed.

One alternative method involves displaying to the user a simple mathematical equation and requiring the user to enter the solution as verification. Although these are much easier to defeat using software, they are suitable for scenarios where graphical imagery is not appropriate, and they provide a much higher level of accessibility for blind users than the image-based CAPTCHAs. These are sometimes referred to as MAPTCHAs (M = 'mathematical'). However, these may be difficult for users with a cognitive disorder.

Other kinds of challenges, such as those that require understanding the meaning of some text (e.g., a logic puzzle, trivia question, or instructions on how to create a password) can also be used as a CAPTCHA. Again, there is little research into their resistance against countermeasures.

== Circumvention ==

There are a few approaches to defeating CAPTCHAs: using cheap human labor to recognize them, exploiting bugs in the implementation that allow the attacker to completely bypass the CAPTCHA, and finally using [[machine learning]] to build an automated solver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jakobsson |first=Markus |title=The death of the Internet|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118062418.html|accessdate=4 April 2016|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to former Google "click fraud czar" [[Shuman Ghosemajumder]], there are numerous services which solve CAPTCHAs automatically.&lt;ref name=ai-security&gt;{{cite news |last=Ghosemajumder |first=Shuman |title=The Imitation Game: The New Frontline of Security |url=http://www.infoq.com/presentations/ai-security |agency=InfoQ| accessdate=8 December 2015 |newspaper=InfoQ |date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machine learning-based attacks ===
In its earliest iterations there was not a systematic methodology for designing or evaluating CAPTCHAs.&lt;ref name=bursz /&gt; As a result, there were many instances in which CAPTCHAs were of a fixed length and therefore automated tasks could be constructed to successfully make educated guesses about where segmentation should take place. Other early CAPTCHAs contained limited sets of words, which made the test much easier to game. Still others made the mistake of relying too heavily on background confusion in the image. In each case, algorithms were created that were successfully able to complete the task by exploiting these design flaws. These methods proved brittle however, and slight changes to the CAPTCHA were easily able to thwart them. Modern CAPTCHAs like [[reCAPTCHA]] no longer rely just on fixed patterns but instead present variations of characters that are often collapsed together, making segmentation almost impossible. These newest iterations have been much more successful at warding off automated tasks.&lt;ref name=bursz2 /&gt;

[[File:Modern-captcha.jpg|thumb|An example of a [[reCAPTCHA]] challenge from 2007, containing the words "following finding". The waviness and horizontal stroke were added to increase the difficulty of breaking the CAPTCHA with a computer program.]]
[[File:Captchacat.png|thumb|A CAPTCHA usually has a text box directly underneath where the user should fill out the text that they see. In this case, 'sclt ..was here']]

In October 2013, artificial intelligence company [[Vicarious (Company)|Vicarious]] claimed that it had developed a generic CAPTCHA-solving algorithm that was able to solve modern CAPTCHAs with character recognition rates of up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Summers|first=Nick|title=Vicarious claims its AI software can crack up to 90% of CAPTCHAs offered by Google, Yahoo and PayPal|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/10/28/vicarious-claims-ai-software-can-now-crack-90-captchas-google-yahoo-paypal/ |publisher=TNW}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Luis von Ahn]], a pioneer of early CAPTCHA and founder of reCAPTCHA, expressed skepticism, stating: "It's hard for me to be impressed since I see these every few months." He pointed out that 50 similar claims to that of Vicarious had been made since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hof |first=Robert |title=AI Startup Vicarious Claims Milestone In Quest To Build A Brain: Cracking CAPTCHA|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2013/10/28/ai-startup-vicarious-claims-milestone-in-quest-to-build-a-brain-craking-captcha/|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 at Usenix WoOT conference, [[Elie Bursztein|Bursztein]] et al. presented the first generic CAPTCHA-solving algorithm based on reinforcement learning and demonstrated its efficiency against many popular CAPTCHA schemas. They concluded that text distortion based CAPTCHAs schemes should be considered insecure moving forward.&lt;ref name="bursz2" /&gt;

=== Cheap or unwitting human labor ===
It is possible to subvert CAPTCHAs by relaying them to a [[sweatshop]] of human operators who are employed to decode CAPTCHAs. A 2005 paper from a [[W3C]] working group stated that such an operator "could easily verify hundreds of them each hour".&lt;ref name="w3c_inaccessibility" /&gt; In 2010 the [[University of California, San Diego|University of California at San Diego]] conducted a large scale study of those CAPTCHA's farms and found out that the retail price for solving one million CAPTCHAs is as low as $1,000.&lt;ref name="motoyama" /&gt;

Another technique used consists of using a script to re-post the target site's CAPTCHA as a CAPTCHA to a site owned by the attacker, which unsuspecting humans visit and correctly solve within a short while for the script to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2004/01/27/solving_and_creating.html |title=Solving and creating captchas with free porn |last=Doctorow |first=Cory |authorlink=Cory Doctorow |date=2004-01-27 |work=Boing Boing |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209040456/http://www.boingboing.net/2004/01/27/solving_and_creating.html |archivedate=2006-02-09 |accessdate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there is controversy around the economic viability of such an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://petmail.lothar.com/design.html#auto34 | title = Hire People To Solve CAPTCHA Challenges | accessdate = 2015-04-27 | date = 2005-07-21 | work = Petmail Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insecure implementation ===
Howard Yeend has identified two implementation issues with poorly designed CAPTCHA systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.puremango.co.uk/cm_breaking_captcha_115.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170625165854/http://www.puremango.co.uk/2005/11/breaking_captcha_115/ | archivedate = 2017-06-25 | title = Breaking CAPTCHAs Without Using OCR | accessdate = 2006-08-22 | year = 2005 | work = (pureMango.co.uk)|first=Howard |last=Yeend }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some CAPTCHA protection systems can be bypassed without using [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] simply by reusing the session ID of a known CAPTCHA image
* CAPTCHAs residing on shared servers also present a problem; a security issue on another virtual host may leave the CAPTCHA issuer's site vulnerable

Sometimes, if part of the software generating the CAPTCHA is [[client-side]] (the validation is done on a server but the text that the user is required to identify is rendered on the client side), then users can modify the client to display the un-rendered text. Some CAPTCHA systems use [[MD5]] hashes stored client-side, which may leave the CAPTCHA vulnerable to a [[brute-force attack]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Notable attacks ===
Some notable attacks against various CAPTCHAs schemas include:
* Mori et al. published a paper in [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] CVPR'03 detailing a method for defeating one of the most popular CAPTCHAs, EZ-Gimpy, which was tested as being 92% accurate in defeating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mori/gimpy/mori_gimpy.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403213029/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mori/gimpy/mori_gimpy.pdf |archivedate=2005-04-03 |title=Breaking a Visual CAPTCHA |publisher=Cs.berkeley.edu |date=2002-12-10 |accessdate=2017-09-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same method was also shown to defeat the more complex and less-widely deployed Gimpy program 33% of the time. However, the existence of implementations of their algorithm in actual use is indeterminate at this time.
* PWNtcha has made significant progress in defeating commonly used CAPTCHAs, which has contributed to a general migration towards more sophisticated CAPTCHAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sam.zoy.org/pwntcha/ |title=PWNtcha – Caca Labs |publisher=Sam.zoy.org |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Podec, a trojan discovered by the security company Kaspersky, forwards CAPTCHA requests to an online human translation service that converts the image to text, fooling the system. Podec targets Android mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmagazineuk.com/kaspersky-discovers-captcha-duping-podec-malware/article/1478464|title=Kaspersky discovers CAPTCHA-duping Podec malware|date=2015-03-11|newspaper=SC Magazine UK|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative CAPTCHAs schemas ==
With the demonstration that text distortion based 
CAPTCHAs are vulnerable to machine learning based attacks, some researchers have proposed alternatives including image recognition CAPTCHAs which require users to identify simple objects in the images presented. The argument in favor of these schemes is that tasks like object recognition are typically more complex to perform than text recognition and therefore should be more resilient to machine learning based attacks. Here are some of notable alternative CAPTCHA schemas:
* Chew et al. published their work in the 7th International Information Security Conference, ISC'04, proposing three different versions of image recognition CAPTCHAs, and validating the proposal with user studies. It is suggested that one of the versions, the anomaly CAPTCHA, is best with 100% of human users being able to pass an anomaly CAPTCHA with at least 90% probability in 42 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~tygar/papers/Image_Recognition_CAPTCHAs/imagecaptcha.pdf |title=Image Recognition CAPTCHAs |publisher=Cs.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Datta et al. published their paper in the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Multimedia]] '05 Conference, named IMAGINATION (IMAge Generation for INternet AuthenticaTION), proposing a systematic way to image recognition CAPTCHAs. Images are distorted in such a way that state-of-the-art image recognition approaches (which are potential attack technologies) fail to recognize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~wangz/project/imsearch/IMAGINATION/ACM05/ |title=Imagination Paper |publisher=Infolab.stanford.edu |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Microsoft (Jeremy Elson, John R. Douceur, Jon Howell, and Jared Saul) have developed Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access (ASIRRA) which ask users to distinguish cats from dogs. Microsoft had a beta version of this for websites to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/asirra-a-captcha-that-exploits-interest-aligned-manual-image-categorization/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215032402/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/asirra/ |archivedate=15 December 2008 |title=Asirra is a human interactive proof that asks users to identify photos of cats and dogs |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They claim "Asirra is easy for users; it can be solved by humans 99.6% of the time in under 30 seconds. Anecdotally, users seemed to find the experience of using Asirra much more enjoyable than a text-based CAPTCHA." This solution was described in a 2007 paper to Proceedings of 14th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/asirra-a-captcha-that-exploits-interest-aligned-manual-image-categorization/ |title=Asirra: A CAPTCHA that Exploits Interest-Aligned Manual Image Categorization}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this project was closed in October 2014 and is no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/asirra/installation.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112032323/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/asirra/installation.aspx |archivedate=12 January 2009 |title=Microsoft's Asirra project closed. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ChaCha''' was a [[human search engine|human-guided]] [[search engine]].  It provided free, real-time answers to any question, through its website, or by using one of the company's [[mobile app]]s.

The company, founded in 2006 by [[Scott A. Jones]] and Brad Bostic, was based in [[Carmel, Indiana|Carmel]], [[Indiana]], United States, part of the [[Indianapolis]] [[Indianapolis metropolitan area|metropolitan area]].  Its name comes from the [[Mandarin Chinese]] word ''cha'' ({{zh|s=[[wikt:查|查]]|t=[[wikt:查|查]]|p=''chá''|w=''ch'a''}}), which means "to search." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2009 |url=http://www.chacha.com/question/how-did-your-company-get-the-name-chacha |accessdate= 2009-05-24 |publisher= chacha.com |title=How did your company get the name ChaCha?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guides ==
ChaCha answered questions through the use of [[Freelancer|independent contractors]] called Guides. Guides were paid $0.02 per answer.

==History==
The [[alpha version]] of ChaCha was launched on September 1, 2006. A [[beta version]] was introduced on November 6, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20061106005649&amp;newsLang=en ChaCha press release] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194225/http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20061106005649&amp;newsLang=en# |date=2007-09-27 }}, [[BusinessWire]], November 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ChaCha said 20,000 guides had registered by year's end and that it had raised US$6 million in development funds, including support from Bezos Expeditions, a personal investment firm owned by [[Jeff Bezos]], the [[entrepreneur]] behind Amazon.com.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070221035245/http://www.chacha.com/press/chacha_funding-01-08-07.pdf "ChaCha secures $6 million in private funding from Jeff Bezos, Rod Canion, Jack Gill and others"], ChaCha press release (January 8, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 2008, ChaCha had 5,000 freelance guides with at least 500 working at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,323569,00.html|title=Review: ChaCha's Text-Message Search Engine|date=17 January 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MogoNews.com reported that ChaCha's first round of equity financing was $14 million plus a $2 million grant from 21st Century Technology Fund.&lt;ref&gt;Duryee, Tricia. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/18/AR2009031802933.html "ChaCha Secures $12M in Financing, Reduces Staff"], mocoNews.net, March 18, 2009, quoting [http://www.pehub.com/34629/chacha-raises-cash-lays-off-staff/ "peHUB"]&lt;/ref&gt;

ChaCha announced on March 17, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://partners.chacha.com/2009/03/17/chacha-secures-12m-in-equity-financing-and-reduces-costs/ |title=ChaCha Secures $12M in Equity Financing and Reduces Costs &amp;#124; ChaCha |publisher= Partners.chacha.com |date=2009-03-17 |accessdate= 2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new round of equity financing totaling US$12 million&lt;ref name="wirelessweek.Ecom"&gt;[http://www.wirelessweek.com/article.aspx?id=166980 "ChaCha Secures $12M in Financing, Reduces Staff"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} By Andrew Berg WirelessWeek.com – March 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; while also laying off 25 people and reducing the salaries of the 56 remaining employees by 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://techcrunch.com/2009/03/17/nobody-is-dancing-at-chacha-one-third-of-employees-get-pink-slips/ | title=Nobody is Dancing At ChaCha.

In July 2010, ChaCha Inc. was recognized as one of the “Hottest Companies in the [[Midwest]]” by Lead411.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lead411.com/midwest-companies.html |title=Lead411 launches 'Hottest Companies in the Midwest' awards |publisher=Lead411.com |date= July 21, 2010 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, ChaCha launched its [[Text Engine|text messaging-based service]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Fixed Mobile Convergence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fixed-mobile-convergence.tmcnet.com/topics/mobile-communications/articles/209000-learn-teach-earn-with-chachas-human-guide-program.htm |title=Learn, Teach, Earn with ChaCha's Human Guide Program |publisher= tmcnet.com |date=August 17, 2011 |accessdate= 2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month the company  reported having answered over 1.7 billion questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://about.chacha.com/2011/08/16/proven-leader-in-%E2%80%9Cwork-from-home%E2%80%9D-opportunities-launching-in-uk/ | title= Proven Leader in Work From Home Opportunities Launching in UK | work= Corporate Press Release | date= August 16, 2011| publisher= ChaCha.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 20, 2012, ChaCha shut down operations in the United Kingdom; the company stated the reason for ending UK operations was that ''"adoption rates for new price-competitive services are quite low in the UK."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/27/qa-site-chacha-cans-uk-expansion-after-poor-user-take-up/ | title= Q&amp;A Site ChaCha Cancels UK Business After Poor User Take-Up | date= April 27, 2012 | publisher= TechCrunch.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, 2016, ChaCha discontinued the guide program due to having insufficient funds available. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guideblog.chacha.com/2016/11/23/apollo-guide-program-retirement|title=Apollo Guide Program Retirement|last=bwigley|first=|date=23 November 2016|website=ChaCha|publisher=ChaCha|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=yes|access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2016, ChaCha shut down operations due to declining advertising revenue, which left it unable to service its debt.&lt;ref name="IBJ.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibj.com/articles/61651-chacha-unable-to-find-financial-answers-shuts-down-operations|title=ChaCha, unable to find financial answers, shuts down operations|work=Indianapolis Business Journal|date=12 December 2016|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==

===Desktop search===
ChaCha was founded with the intention to offer human-guided search from within a web browser and for the search engine to learn from the results provided by their freelancers.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2006-09-06-google-chacha_x.htm |title=One day searchers may quit Googling and start ChaCha-ing |publisher=USA Today |date=2006-09-06 |accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system offered a chat on the left side of the page where users could [[Online chat|chat]] with the guides and conclude their search.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com" /&gt; The center of the page contained results that a guide could add or remove (later users could also add or remove these results).  The right side of the page contained ads that were relevant to the search.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srajaram.com/images/chacha_m.jpg JPG screenshot]. srajaram.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Desktop search was phased out in April 2008 in favor of mobile products.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://techcrunch.com/2008/03/31/chacha-ditches-guided-search-model-i-love-to-hate-this-startup/ | title=ChaCha Ditches Guided Search Model. I Love To Hate This Startup | publisher= TechCrunch | date=March 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile search===
Users were able to send an SMS message with their question to 242–242, where Guides would then answer it. Standard messaging fees could apply, but ChaCha never charged additional fees. The company answered over 2 million text message questions daily. Cha Cha no longer supports questions via SMS.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2014}}

===Voice search===
ChaCha launched its beta version of a call-in search service on April 1, 2008, while discontinuing its less effective guided web search.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com" /&gt; Users called a toll-free number (800-2ChaCha) to have a human answer their questions via SMS.

===Mobile marketing===
In July 2008, ChaCha launched its first mobile marketing campaign with Coca-Cola to promote its [[My Coke Rewards]] program to users interested in [[NASCAR]] racing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/blogs/daves-download/2008/8/8/chacha-cofounder-describes-how-the-company-is-making-money.html "ChaCha Cofounder Describes How the Company Is Making Money"], ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', August 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox News]] reported that ChaCha planned by mid-2008 to charge users $5–$10 per month once they exceeded 10 queries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,323569,00.html "Review: ChaCha's Text-Message Search Engine"] Thursday, January 17, 2008 at FoxNews.com quoting Candace Choi with AP&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by May 2009, no additional fees had been implemented, nor had any plans been officially announced by a reliable source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.chacha.com/MonthlyUsageInfo |title=ChaCha Content – Usage Limit |publisher=Content.chacha.com |date=2009-05-07 |accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, 2008, ChaCha launched its [[SMS]] Advertising Platform at [[ad:tech]] New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adtechblog.com/blog/detail/akamai-chacha-announce-parties-at-new-york-adtech/ |title=Akamai, ChaCha Announce Parties at New York |publisher=Adtechblog.com |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2010-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208035229/http://www.adtechblog.com/blog/detail/akamai-chacha-announce-parties-at-new-york-adtech/ |archivedate=February 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partners.chacha.com/blog/index.php/2008/11/24/podcast-released-our-adtech-making-mobile-work-workshop/ |title=Podcast released: Our ad:tech "Making Mobile Work" workshop |publisher= chacha.com |date= |accessdate= 2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, ChaCha reported 30 million "impressions per month" and "3.6 million users" since January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partners.chacha.com/2009/03/17/chacha-secures-12m-in-equity-financing-and-reduces-costs/ |title=ChaCha press release March 17, 2009 |publisher=Partners.chacha.com |date=2009-03-17 |accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wirelessweek.com/article.aspx?id=166980 "ChaCha Secures $12M in Financing, Reduces Staff"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} By Andrew Berg in WirelessWeek.com – March 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; An ESPN 2009 article stated that ChaCha gets about 1,000,000 questions each day according to their tipsheets.&lt;ref name="espn2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=4088415 |title=Reilly: ChaCha has all the answers – unless I'm on the other end |work= [[ESPN The Magazine]] |publisher= [[Go.com]] |date=October 5, 2009| accessdate= 2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former [[Yahoo]] executive opened a New York City office for ChaCha in hopes of increasing advertising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/video-player.asp?id=9505 "ChaCha's CEO, Scott Jones, on layoffs, new funding and sales staff increases"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527215237/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/video-player.asp?id=9505# |date=2014-05-27 }} March 18, 2009 audio by InsideINdianaBusiness.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, [[Rick Reilly]] spent some time working for ChaCha for an article on ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="espn2009" /&gt;

The '''Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors''' or '''ICES''' is a  professional association in the field of civil engineering surveying. ICES is now recognised as the leading chartered professional body for civil engineering surveyors. ICES members consist mainly of commercial managers and [[geospatial engineering|geospatial engineers]] working and studying within [[civil engineering]] surveying. The institution began in 1969 as the Association of Surveyors in Civil Engineering and became a registered educational charity in 1992. In 1992, ICES became the first associated institution of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) and together formed two joint boards to provide and disseminate surveying knowledge and expertise; the Geospatial Engineering Board and Commercial Management Board. ICES also has reciprocal membership agreements in place with the ICE.

== International recognition ==
ICES is an internationally recognised qualifying body established to regulate, educate and train surveyors working within civil engineering. The headquarters are in the United Kingdom, with 11 regions consisting of volunteer-led committee members. ICES regions include  the UK, Ireland, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates. ICES also has memoranda of understandings agreements with many international surveying institutions and is a member of the [[International Federation of Surveyors|International Federation of Surveyors (FIG)]].

== Membership ==
Applicants for membership must demonstrate that they have fulfilled the institution's competency requirements and the general competencies plus at least one specialism must be met with and signed off by a sponsor.

Members may use designations after their names such as:
*FCInstCES for Fellow of the Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors, Chartered Civil Engineering Surveyor.
*MCInstCES for Member of the Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors, Chartered Civil Engineering Surveyor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7533">The '''Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking''', or CMIS, is a theoretical construct designed to predict how people will seek information.  It was first developed by J. David Johnson and has been utilized by a variety of disciplines including [[Library and Information Science]] and [[Health Communication]].

The CMIS has been empirically tested in health and organizational contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D., &amp; Meischke, H. (1993). Cancer-related channel selection:  An extensionfor a sample of women who have had a mammogram. Women &amp; Health, 20, 31-44.; Johnson, J. D., Donohue, W. A., Atkin, C. K., &amp; Johnson, S. H. (1995). A comprehensive model of information seeking: Tests focusing on a technical organization. 
Science Communication, 16, 274-303.&lt;/ref&gt; It has inherent strengths for studying how people react to health problems such as cancer.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Johnson, J. D., Andrews, J. E. &amp; Allard, S. (2001). A Model for Understanding and Affecting Genetics Information Seeking. Library and Information Science Research 23(4): 335-349.&lt;/ref&gt; It specifies "antecedents" that explain why people become information seekers, "information carrier characteristic" that shape how they go about looking for information, and "information seeking actions" that reflect the nature of the search itself.

==Design==

[[File:Diagram of the Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking.jpg|thumb|right|The Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking]]
The CMIS has been quantitatively tested and performs well when it comes to health information seeking behaviors (HISB).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; There are three main schemas in the CMIS. These are:  Antecedents, information field, and information seeking actions.  The antecedents are those factors that determine how an information consumer will receive the information.  Those factors are:  Demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs.  These factors are fluid and can change during the health information seeking process.  The second schema is the information fields that consist of characteristics and utilities.  This schema is concerned with the channels and carriers of information.  A person’s understanding is developed through the information field.  The third schema involves the transformational processes and measured by the consumer’s understanding of the messages received through the information field.  The final schema involves information seeking actions.  This is what the consumer does as a result of the first two schemas through information seeking.  There are three major dimensions:  the scope, depth, and method of information seeking.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Antecedents==
The CMIS antecedents—demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs—are factors that determine an individual's natural predisposition to search for information from particular information carriers. Certain types of health information seeking can be triggered by an individual's degree of personal experience with disease.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D. (1997). Cancer-related information seeking. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the CMIS framework, two personal relevance factors, salience and beliefs, are seen as the primary determinants in translating a perceived gap into an active search for information. Salience refers to the personal significance of health information to the individual, such as perceptions of risk to one's health, which are likely to result in information seeking action. However, people also may be motivated to gather information to determine the implications of health events for themselves and/or others related to their future activities, a factor directly related to the rapidly growing field of genetics. An individual's beliefs about the nature of a particular disease, its impacts, and level of control, all directly relate to self-efficacy, one of our key variables, and one that plays an important role in information seeking and people's more general pattern of actions related to health.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D.(1997). Cancer-related information seeking. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information Carrier Characteristics==

The information carrier characteristics are drawn from a model of Media Exposure and Appraisal (MEA) that has been tested on a variety of information carriers, including both sources and channels, and in a variety of cultural settings. Following the MEA, the CMIS focuses on editorial tone, communication potential, and utility. In the CMIS, characteristics are composed of editorial tone, which reflects an audience member's perception of credibility, while communication potential relates to issues of style and comprehensiveness. Utility relates the characteristics of a medium directly to the needs of an individual, and shares much with the uses and gratifications perspectives. For example, is the information contained in the medium relevant, topical, and important for the individual's purposes? In general, utility is very important for health information seeking.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Information Seeking Actions==

There are several types of information seeking actions that can result from the impetus provided by the factors identified by the CMIS. For example, search behavior can be characterized by its extent, or the number of activities carried out, which has two components: scope, the number of alternatives investigated; and, depth, the number of dimensions of an alternative investigated. There is also the method of the search, or channel, as another major dimension of the search.  For instance, an individual might choose the method of consulting a telephone information service, decide to have a narrow scope by only asking questions about smoking cessation clinics, but investigate every recommendation in detail, thus increasing the depth of the search.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Stages in the CMIS==

A key concept from the CMIS is the notion of “stages,” or “cancer involvement”.  According to the CMIS, an individual may be at one of four stages regarding a cancer threat, and thereby have differing information needs and behaviors.

The first stage, ''Casual'', is characterized by a general lack of concern or interest. At this stage, individuals are not purposive in their search for cancer-related information; rather, their search is accidental and aimless, even apathetic.
 
The second stage is ''Purposive-Placid''. This is characterized by the question, “What can I do to prevent cancer?” Individuals here might have some passing interest in cancer or genetic information, but are generally still not affected or directly concerned.

The third stage is ''Purposive-Clustered''. Here, an individual will be in closer proximity to cancer. This is the point at which a person is motivated to look for practical information that will address the specific problem. For example, a first-degree relative of a recently diagnosed breast cancer patient may seek genetic screening or [[BRCA mutation|BRCA]] 1/2 testing. The person could clearly benefit from such information- seeking behavior since medical authorities acknowledge that early detection of cancer leads to earlier treatments and better treatment outcomes.

The fourth stage, ''Directed'', includes individuals who have been diagnosed as having cancer. Such individuals need knowledge for making informed decisions about treatment and management of the disease.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8386">The '''conservation and restoration of glass objects''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from [[glass]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].
[[File:Roman Brown Glass during and after conservation - restoration.jpg|thumb|right|Roman Brown Glass during and after conservation]]

Glass was discovered in the third millennium B.C.E. and is still a relatively new material. The art of glassworking did not occur until long after [[metalworking|metalwork]] or [[pottery]].&lt;ref name= "Koob"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Koob |first=Stephen |title=Conservation and Care of Glass Objects |publisher=Archetype Publications |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=1-904982-08-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of [[conservation and restoration]] strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use. [[Water]] is the primary cause of deterioration in glass materials.&lt;ref name = "Koob" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Newton |first=Roy |author2=Sandra Davison |title= Conservation of Glass |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann|Butterworths]] |year=1989 |isbn=0-408-10623-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of deterioration==
'''Weathering'''

[[Weathering]] is a broad definition for any form of deterioration which appears on the surface of the glass and is caused by exposure to adverse conditions.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt;  Below are the seven typical forms of weathering.

''Dulling'' is the simplest form of weathering. It occurs when glass loses its clarity and transparency and becomes translucent.&lt;ref name= "Tennent"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Tennent |first= Norman, ed. |title= The Conservation of Glass and Ceramics: Research, Practice and Training |publisher= James &amp; James (Science Publishers) Ltd. |year= 1999 |location= London |isbn= 1-873936-18-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Strain cracking'' describes the presence of minuscule cracks running through the glass in all directions, giving it a sugary appearance and causing the glass to disintegrate.

''Frosting''

''[[Iridescence]]'' is caused by continuous flaking of a glass surface causing a multi-colored sheen to appear on the surface of formerly transparent glass.&lt;ref name= "Tennent" /&gt;

''Milky''

''Enamel-like''

'''Devitrification'''
{{Main article|Devitrification}}

Devitrification is the process of converting glass into a crystalline substance by heating it to a temperature just below its melting point then cooled. By doing this, the randomly situated molecules in the glass, when cooled, will attempt to settle in a less random and more crystalline form.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt; This technique is used to create an opaque appearance in the glass. Due to the high level of stress this technique places on the glass, it may cause the glass to deteriorate.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt;  For more information on devitrification as an artistic technique, see the main article above.

The term "devitrification" is used by archaeologists and art historians to refer to a glass object which has lost it [[vitreous lustre|vitreous nature]], giving the glass a weathered appearance.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt;  This is first caused by the loss of [[alkali]] then followed by the loss of other materials of the glass, and finally the creation of a silica gel, indicating the change in the glass's chemical composition.

'''Crizzling'''
{{Main article|Crizzling}}

Atmospheric deterioration, commonly referred to as crizzling, weeping or glass disease is primarily caused by a chemical imbalance in specific types of glass, though it can occur in almost any glass.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;  This form of deterioration is a basic defect in glass caused by incorrect proportions of ingredients, particularly an excess of alkali in the glass composite.&lt;ref name= "Newton/Davison" /&gt; Crizzling occurs in 5 main stages.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;

''Stage One''

:The "initial stage" of crizzling occurs when alkali is present on the glass, giving the glass a cloudy or hazy appearance.&lt;ref name= "CMOG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmog.org/article/crizzling |title=Crizzling |author= |date=April 26, 2012 |work= |publisher=Corning Museum of Glass |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If neglected, crizzling's initial stage may occur within five or 10 years of the glass's manufacturing. Indications of crizzling may be seen as tiny droplets in high (above 55%) humidity or as fine crystals in low (below 40%) relative humidity.&lt;ref name = "Koob" /&gt; A feeling of slippery or slimy glass is another possible indication of stage one crizzling. The initial stage is treatable. Washing the glass removes the alkali and will keep the glass looking new.:

''Stage Two''

:"Incipient crizzling" has similar characteristic symptoms as stage one, however, the haziness seen on the glass may not disappear entirely when washed and dried. When examined closely at an angle with a low light, fine cracks, which appear as tiny silvery lines or shimmering rays, may be visible.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt; A microscope can confirm the presence of cracks.  These cracks are the first sign of deterioration in the glass. The cracks are caused by a combination of the cycling of the glass through humid and dry environments and the loss of alkali, leaving microscopic voids in the glass.:&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

''Stage Three''

:"Full-blown crizzling" occurs when the fine cracks in the glass during stage two of deterioration have progressed and are visible to the naked eye. In some cases, the crazing also gains a more uniform appearance.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;  The deeper cracks are indicative of higher amounts of alkali leaching from the glass composition. Crizzling may not be uniform due to the creation of micro-climates on the glass. Crizzling is far more likely to occur in areas with restricted air-flow. Symptoms of stage one and two may also be present on the glass if this advanced form of deterioration has not affected all of the glass's surface.:&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

''Stage Four''

:"Advanced crizzling" shows distinctive cracks on the surface of the glass. The fissures may be so deep that some surface material may be lost from flaking of chipping, this is referred to as spalling.:&lt;ref name="Koob" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;

''Stage Five''

:The "fragmentation stage" of crizzling is the final stage of deterioration and occurs when the structural integrity of the glass is no longer present causing the glass to separate into pieces.:&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

'''Storage and handling'''

== Education and training ==
In France, conservators specialized in earthenware and glassware are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10041">'''Context-sensitive solutions''' (CSS) is a theoretical and practical approach to transportation decision-making and design that takes into consideration the communities and lands through which streets, roads, and highways pass ("the context"). The term is closely related to but distinguishable from '''context-sensitive design''' in that it asserts that all decisions in transportation planning, project development, operations, and maintenance should be responsive to the context in which these activities occur, not simply the design process. CSS seeks to balance the need to move vehicles efficiently and safely with other desirable outcomes, including [[historic preservation]], environmental [[sustainability]], and the creation of vital public spaces. In transit projects, CSS generally refers to context sensitive planning, design, and development around transit stations, also known as [[transit-oriented development]].

==Overview==
[[File:Ammonite lamp post at dusk, Lyme Regis.JPG|thumb|200px|Custom-designed fittings are one aspect of CSS. Here, the ammonite design of the lamnp standards reflects the local geology of Lyme Regis.]]
In contrast to long-standing practices in transportation design that place primary importance on moving traffic ([[vehicular throughput]]), the CSS process emphasizes that transportation facilities should fit their physical settings and preserve scenic, aesthetic, historic and environmental resources, while maintaining safety and mobility. For instance, if a state highway that passes through a downtown main street, applying CSS principles would entail creating a street where the movement of vehicles does not impede pedestrian activity and sidewalk commerce, rather than a street that is simply widened and straightened to increase speed, capacity and mobility for vehicles as a singular transportation objective. CSS therefore includes principles for context-sensitive decision-making that place a high value on community input and consensus, and more technical principles of context sensitive design.

When CSS principles are applied to transportation projects, the process involves a much broader range of disciplines than traditional transportation design methods, which rely exclusively on the judgment of traffic engineers. CSS is a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach that involves everyone with a significant stake in the project, such as the residents, businesses and local institutions that will be affected by an intervention or a failure to address the transportation implications of development such as congestion. Rather than approaching these stakeholders at the tail end of the design process in an attempt to gain approval, CSS emphasizes the need to incorporate their feedback from the very outset of the planning and design development processes and during all subsequent stages of construction, operations and maintenance.

==Qualities of a CSS project==

The following list of qualities (developed at a 1998 conference for transportation planners called '''"Thinking Beyond the Pavement"'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.contextsensitivesolutions.org/content/reading/tbtp-conference/resources/tbtp-conference/&lt;/ref&gt;) describe the core goals of the CSS process.

{{Quotation|'''The CSS Product: Qualities of Excellence in Transportation Design'''&lt;br /&gt;
The "Qualities that Characterize Excellence in Transportation Design" – that is, of the physical end product of the CSS process – are: 
* The project satisfies the purpose and needs as agreed to by a full range of stakeholders.
* This agreement is forged in the earliest phase of the project and amended as warranted as the project develops.
* The project is a safe facility for both the user and the community.
* The project is in harmony with the community, and it preserves environmental, scenic, aesthetic, historic, and natural resource values of the area, i.e., exhibits context sensitive design.
* The project exceeds the expectations of both designers and stakeholders and achieves a level of excellence in people's minds.
* The project involves efficient and effective use of the resources (time, budget, community) of all involved parties.
* The project is designed and built with minimal disruption to the community.
* The project is seen as having added lasting value to the community.
|As agreed upon by participants of the Thinking Beyond the Pavement Conference, 1998}}

==The CSS process==

This outline of the core steps in the CSS process was also developed at the "Thinking Beyond the Pavement" conference.

{{Quotation|'''The CSS Process: Characteristics of the Process That Yield Excellence'''&lt;br /&gt;
"The Characteristics of the Process that will Yield Excellence in Transportation Design" are: 
*Communication with all stakeholders is open, honest, early, and continuous.
*A multidisciplinary team is established early, with disciplines based on the needs of the specific project, and with the inclusion of the public.
*A full range of stakeholders is involved with transportation officials in the scoping phase (the period before design is begun when the scope of the project is agreed upon). The purposes of the project are clearly defined, and consensus on the scope is forged before proceeding.
*The highway development process is tailored to meet the circumstances. This process should examine multiple alternatives that will result in a consensus of approach methods.
*A commitment to the process from top agency officials and local leaders is secured.
*The public involvement process, which includes informal meetings, is tailored to the project.
*The landscape, the community, and valued resources are understood before engineering design is started. A full range of tools for communication about project alternatives is used (e.g., visualization).
|As agreed upon by participants of the Thinking Beyond the Pavement Conference, 1998}}

==History==

The initial guiding principles of CSS came out of the 1998 "Thinking Beyond the Pavement" conference as a means to describe and foster transportation projects that preserve and enhance the natural and built environments along with economic and social assets for neighborhoods they pass through. In 2003, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] announced that under one of its three Vital Few Objectives (Environmental Stewardship and Streamlining) they had a target goal of  achieving CSS integration within all state Departments of Transportation by September 2007.

The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Organizations (AASHTO) is now (fall 2006) developing strategic goals and objectives for CSS which it describes as a "fundamental change in the way we do business." One principal element of this change is the way transportation planners and engineers address speed. Historically, the speed at which a vehicle can safely travel through the landscape has been regarded as a primary goal of transportation planning since it shortens travel time, saves money (time is money), and improves driver convenience. However, CSS recognizes that designing a facility for the maximum safe speed that is economically feasible can be detrimental to other community goals, and even to vehicle passengers themselves. CSS recognizes that the goal of transportation is social and economic exchange, which cannot occur at high speeds. Instead, CSS attempts to identify, through a community-based process, a  "target speed" that promotes the optimum amount of social and economic exchange, with lowest environmental impacts, that is appropriate for the context. Thus, in cities, if higher vehicle speeds lower the amount of social exchange on a residential street (fewer friends, less street life etc.) then the street will be designed to encourage drivers to slow down so as not to reduce social exchange. In a similar manner, commercial streets will be designed to maximize commercial exchange and designed accordingly. In more rural areas where a primary goal is to move people and goods between human settlements, CSS can be compatible with much higher design speeds. Setting a target speed that is appropriate for the context, and then designing roads, highway and streets to make it difficult for drivers to exceed that target speed, is a central CSS principle and represents a fundamental shift in transportation planning practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4628">The '''Croatian Language Corpus''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatski jezični korpus}}, HJK) is a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] compiled at the [[Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics]] ([[Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics|IHJJ]]).

== Background ==
The CLC was initially funded as a sub-project of the research program ''Riznica'' (''Croatian Language Repository'') by the [[Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (Croatia)|Ministry of Science, Education, and Sports of the Republic of Croatia]] ([[Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (Croatia)|MZOŠ]]) (project no. 0212010) from May 2005. In a second development phase, since 2007, the further extension and development of the CLC was embedded within the research program ''The Croatian Language Repository'' (CLR) that was granted by the [[Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (Croatia)|MZOŠ]] (cf. Ćavar and Brozović Rončević, 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://riznica.ihjj.hr/CLC-Slavicorp.pdf Ćavar and Brozović Rončević, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;). Being a research program (PI [[Dunja Brozović Rončević]]) with numerous subsumed independent research projects that make use of the CLC, the corpus is mainly developed as a by-product of those research projects within the CLR. Currently [[Dunja Brozović Rončević]] and [[Damir Ćavar]] are in charge of the corpus development.

== Goals ==
One of the main goals of the CLC project is to create a publicly available [[Croatian language|Croatian]] [[Text corpus|corpus]] that is annotated on multiple levels, i.e. [[Lemmatization|lemmatized]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] segmented and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morpho-syntactically]] annotated, [[phonemic]]ally transcribed and syllabified, and syntactically parsed. While the current version of the [[Text corpus|corpus]] provides resources from the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] language standard, several [[Text corpus|corpora]] from different development phases of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] are created as well, including the digitizations of manuscripts and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dictionaries.

== Format and Availability ==
From the outset, the collected and digitized texts in the CLC were annotated using the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] ([[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]]) P5 [[XML]] standard. Currently approx. 90 mil. tokens are available in the [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] P5 [[XML]] format. The [[Text corpus|corpus]] can be accessed online via the Philologic&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/philologic3/home Philologic]&lt;/ref&gt; interface (see The ARTFL Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ARTFL/ The ARTFL Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, [[University of Chicago|The University of Chicago]]). It is virtualized into various sub-corpora, and individual or specific definitions of sub-corpora can be provided on demand.

== Content ==
The CLC is assembled from selected text of [[Croatian language|Croatian]], covering various functional domains and genres. It includes literature and other written sources from the period of the beginning of the final shaping of the standardization of the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] language, i.e. from the second half of the 19th century on.

The CLC consists of:
* fundamental Croatian literature (e.g. novels, short stories, drama, poetry)
* non-fiction
* scientific publications from various domains and University textbooks
* school books
* translated literature from outstanding [[Croatian language|Croatian]] translators
* online journals and newspapers
* books from the pre-standardization period of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] that are adapted to nowadays standard [[Croatian language|Croatian]]

== Cooperation ==
The realization of the CLC was made possible in cooperation with:
* [[Školska knjiga|Školska knjiga d.d.]]
* [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts (HAZU)]]
* Stoljeća hrvatske književnosti, [[Matica hrvatska]]

'''Design objective''' (DO):  In [[telecommunication|communications]] systems, a desired performance characteristic for communications circuits and equipment that is based on engineering analyses, but (a) is not considered feasible to mandate in a [[standardization|standard]], or (b) has not been tested.  

DOs are used because applicable systems standards are not in existence. 

Examples of reasons for designating a performance characteristic as a DO rather than as a standard are (a) it may be bordering on an advancement in the state of the art, (b) the requirement may not have been fully confirmed by measurement or experience with operating circuits, and (c) it may not have been demonstrated that the requirement can be met considering other constraints, such as cost and size. 

A DO is sometimes established in a standard for developmental consideration. A DO may also specify a performance characteristic used in the preparation of specifications for development or [[procurement]] of new equipment or systems.

Design is the process of formulation of a plan for satisfaction of human needs

An '''ectomycorrhiza''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐκτός ''ektos'', "outside", μύκης ''mykes'', "fungus", and ῥίζα ''rhiza'', "root"; pl. '''ectomycorrhizas''' or '''ectomycorrhizae''', abbreviated '''EcM''') is a form of [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] that occurs between a [[fungus|fungal]] [[symbiont]] and the [[root]]s of various [[plant]] [[species]]. The [[mycobiont]] tends to be predominantly from the [[phylum|phyla]] [[Basidiomycota]] and [[Ascomycota]], although a few are represented in the phylum [[Zygomycota]].&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tedersoo |first1=Leho |last2=May |first2=Tom W. |last3=Smith |first3=Matthew E. |title=Ectomycorrhizal lifestyle in fungi: global diversity, distribution, and evolution of phylogenetic lineages |journal=Mycorrhiza |volume=20 |issue=4 |year=2010 |pages=217–263 |doi=10.1007/s00572-009-0274-x |url=http://lira.pro.br/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tedersoo-et-al-2010.pdf |pmid=20191371}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ectomycorrhizas form between fungi and the roots of around 2% of plant species.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; These tend to be composed of [[woody plants]], including species from the [[betulaceae|birch]], [[dipterocarp]], [[myrtaceae|myrtle]], [[fagaceae|beech]], [[salicaceae|willow]], [[pinaceae|pine]] and [[rosaceae|rose]] families.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Smith|first1=Sally E.|last2=Read|first2=David J. |title=Mycorrhizal Symbiosis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLciOJaG0C4C|accessdate=|date=26 July 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-055934-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other [[mycorrhiza]]l relationships, such as [[arbuscular mycorrhiza]] and [[ericoid mycorrhiza]], ectomycorrhizal fungi do not penetrate their [[host (biology)|host’s]] [[cell walls]]. Instead, they form an entirely intercellular interface, consisting of highly branched [[hyphae]] forming a latticework between [[epidermis (botany)|epidermal]] and [[cortex (botany)|cortical]] root cells, known as the [[Hartig net]].

Ectomycorrhizas are further differentiated from other mycorrhizas by the formation of a dense hyphal sheath, known as the mantle, surrounding the root surface.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hock |first=Bertold |title=Fungal Associations |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-30826-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sheathing mantle can be up to 40&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] thick, with hyphae extending up to several centimeters into the surrounding soil. This hyphal network aids in water and nutrient uptake often helping the host plant to survive adverse conditions,&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; and in exchange, the fungal symbiont is provided with access to carbohydrates.

Many EcM fungal [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]] are well known. These include the economically important and edible [[truffle]] ([[truffle|''Tuber'']]) and the deadly [[death cap]]s and [[destroying angel]]s (''[[Amanita]]''). They also form on many common [[temperate forest]] [[trees]], such as pines (''[[Pinus]]''), oaks (''[[Quercus]]''), willows (''[[Salix]]''), Douglas firs (''[[Pseudotsuga]]''), eucalypts (''[[Eucalyptus]]''), beeches (''[[beech|Fagus]]'') and birches (''[[Betula]]'').

There have been tremendous advances in research concerning ectomycorrhizal identification and [[ecology|ecological]] importance over the past few years. This has led to a more complete understanding of the intricate and varied roles ectomycorrhizas play in the [[ecosystem]]. These advances in knowledge have led to increased applicability in areas such as [[ecosystem management]] and [[restoration ecology|restoration]], [[forestry]] and [[agriculture]].

== Evolution ==
Mycorrhizal symbioses, in general, are ubiquitous in [[terrestrial ecosystem]]s, and it is possible that these associations helped to facilitate [[evolutionary history of life#Colonization of land|land colonization]] by plants. [[paleobiology|Paleobiological]] and molecular evidence suggest that [[arbuscular mycorrhizas]] (AM), in particular, originated at least 460 million years ago.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simon |first1=Luc |last2=Bousquet |first2=Jean |last3=Lévesque |first3=Roger C. |last4=Lalonde |first4=Maurice|title=Origin and diversification of endomycorrhizal fungi and coincidence with vascular land plants |journal=Nature |volume=363 |year=1993 |pages=67–69 |doi=10.1038/363067a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v363/n6424/abs/363067a0.html |issue=6424 |bibcode=1993Natur.363...67S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EcM plants and fungi exhibit a wide [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] distribution and are similarly present across all continents (apart from Antarctica), suggesting the EcM symbiosis has ancient [[evolution]]ary roots, as well.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; [[Pinaceae]] represents the oldest extant plant family in which symbiosis with EcM fungi occurs,&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hibbett |first1=David S. |last2=Matheny |first2=P. Brandon|title=The relative ages of ectomycorrhizal mushrooms and their plant hosts estimated using Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses |journal=BMC Biology |volume=7 |issue=13 |pages=13 |year=2009 |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-7-13 |pmid=19284559 |pmc=2660285 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fossils]] from this family date back to 156 million years ago.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=LePage |first1=Ben A. |last2=Currah |first2=Randolph S. |last3=Stockey |first3=Ruth A. |last4=Rothwell| first4=Gar W. |title=Fossil ectomycorrhizae from the Middle Eocene |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=84 |issue=3 |year=1997 |pages=410–412 |url=http://www.amjbot.org/content/84/3/410.full.pdf |doi=10.2307/2446014|jstor=2446014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular [[theory]] proposed by Read&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Read |first1=David J. |title=Mycorrhizas in ecosystems |journal=Experientia |volume=47 |issue=4 |year=1991 |pages=376–391 |doi=10.1007/BF01972080}}&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that [[habitat]] type and the distinct functions of different mycorrhizas help determine the particular symbiosis that will become predominant. In this theory, EcM symbioses evolved in relatively productive ecosystems, such as [[taiga|boreal forests]], but in which [[nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]] could still be limiting. In this scenario, ectomycorrhizas are a somewhat intermediate form, having greater mineralization capacities than [[arbuscular mycorrhizas]] and less so than types such as [[ericoid mycorrhiza]]s. This is supported by several studies, some of which also purport arbuscular mycorrhizas to be the [[basal (phylogenetics)|ancestral trait]]. According to this data, many non-mycorrhizal and other mycorrhizal forms represent evolutionary specializations.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fitter | first1=A. H. | last2=Moyersoen | first2=B. | year=1996 | title=Evolutionary trends in root-microbe symbioses | url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/351/1345/1367.abstract | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume=351 | issue=1345| pages=1367–1375 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1996.0120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=B. |last2=Qiu |first2=Y.-L. |title=Phylogenetic distribution and evolution of mycorrhizas in land plants |journal=Mycorrhiza |volume=16 |issue=5 |year=2006 |pages=299–363 |doi=10.1007/s00572-005-0033-6 |url=http://www.planta.cn/forum/files_planta/phylogenetic_distribution_and_evolution_of_mycorrhizas__744.pdf |pmid=16845554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paleobiology ===
Fungi tend to be composed of [[soft tissues]], making [[fossilization]] difficult and the discovery of fungal fossils incredibly rare. This is compounded by the microscopic size and ephemeral nature of ectomycorrhizas and their structure. However, some exquisitely preserved specimens have been discovered in the middle [[Eocene]] [[Princeton Chert]] of [[British Columbia]]. These ectomycorrhizal fossils show clear evidence of a [[Hartig net]], mantle and [[hyphae]], demonstrating well-established EcM associations at least 50 million years ago.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

It is widely known from the fossil record that the more common arbuscular mycorrhizas formed long before more derived associations, and thus represent an ancestral condition.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; Ectomycorrhizas, forming with an array of [[conifers]] and [[angiosperms]], may have evolved along with the diversification of plants. Thus, it is possible that arbuscular mycorrhizas were a driving force in the plant colonization of land as an expansive new [[ecological niche|niche]], while ectomycorrhizas acted to spur further [[speciation]] due to the change of [[climatology|earth’s climate]] to more seasonal and arid, or perhaps simply in response to nutritionally deficient habitats.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;Allen, Michael F. The ecology of mycorrhizae. Cambridge University Press, 1991. {{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Molecular studies ===
According to molecular and [[phylogenetic]] analyses of fungal lineages, it appears that EcM fungi have evolved multiple times from [[humus]] and wood [[saprotrophic]] ancestors, with little reversion.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; It is suggested that the EcM condition has evolved and persisted numerous times independently from non-EcM ancestors. These claims range from more conservative estimates of 7-16&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eleven"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hibbett | first1=David S. | last2=Gilbert | first2=Luz-Beatriz | last3=Donoghue | first3=Michael J. | year=2000 | title=Evolutionary instability of ectomycorrhizal symbioses in basidiomycetes | url=http://www.economicgeography.org/faculty/dhibbett/Reprints%20PDFs/Hibbett%20et%20al%202000%20Nature.pdf | journal=Nature | volume=407 | issue=6803| pages=506–508 | doi=10.1038/35035065 | pmid=11029000| bibcode=2000Natur.407..506H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bruns | first1=Thomas D. | last2=Shefferson | first2=Richard P. | year=2004 | title=Evolutionary studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi: recent advances and future directions | url=http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/brunslab/papers/bruns2004a.pdf | journal=Canadian Journal of Botany | volume=82 | issue=8| pages=1122–1132 | doi=10.1139/b04-021}}&lt;/ref&gt; to approximately 66 origins of EcM associations.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

Some studies suggest that reversals back to the ancestral free-living condition have occurred,&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; but this evidence has been extensively challenged because: 1) the data exhibits [[maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)#Taxon sampling|taxa sampling]] [[bias (statistics)|bias]] and model dependency, 2) most non-mycorrhizal taxa lie within strongly AM [[cladistics|clades]], rather than EcM ones, and 3) the derived EcM condition is specialized, and would likely have given an ecological advantage that reversion to [[saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophy]] would not have.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="twelve" /&gt; Furthermore, Hibbett and Matheny performed Bayesian relaxed [[molecular clock]] analyses yielding results that indicate that an ancestral EcM condition that was subsequently lost multiple times is simply not [[occam's razor|parsimonious]]. These reversals to a saprotrophic mode are impractical given that the host plants involved in the EcM symbioses ([[Pinaceae]] and [[rosids]]) had not yet evolved when the studied class [[Agaricomycetes]] first appeared.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

== Morphology ==
[[File:Ectomycorrhiza illustration.jpg|thumb|Basic morphology of a common ectomycorrhizal association]]

As suggested by the name, much of the [[biomass]] of the mycosymbiont lies exterior to the plant root. The fungal structure is composed primarily of three parts: 1) the intraradical [[hyphae]] making up the [[Hartig net]], 2) the mantle that forms a sheath surrounding the root tip and 3) the [[extraradical hyphae]] and related structures that spread throughout the soil matrix.

=== Hartig net ===
The hartig net is formed by an ingrowth of hyphae (often originating from the inner part of the surrounding mantle) into the root of the plant host. The hyphae making up the Hartig net penetrate and grow in a transverse direction to the axis of the root,&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Blasius | first1=D. | display-authors=etal | year=1986 | title=Hartig net structure and formation in fully ensheathed ectomycorrhizas | journal=Nordic Journal of Botany | volume=6 | issue=6| pages=837–842 | doi=10.1111/j.1756-1051.1986.tb00487.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus form a network between the outer cells of the root axis. This region of juxtaposition is where nutrient and [[carbon]] exchange occurs.&lt;ref name="fourteen"&gt;Dighton, J. "Mycorrhizae." Encyclopedia of Microbiology (2009): 153-162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The depth of penetration differs between species, with some being superficially confined to the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] (such as in ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' and ''[[Alnus]]''), whereas in other cases the hyphae extend to the cortical cells or to the [[endodermis]] (as is the case in most [[gymnosperms]]).&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; In many epidermal types, radial elongation of epidermal cells occurs. However, this is largely absent in the cortical type, suggesting different strategies of increasing surface contact among species.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

=== Mantle ===
Enveloping the root, and often containing more biomass than the Hartig net interface, is a hyphal sheath known as the mantle. There exists considerable variation in the structure of the mantle, ranging from a loose network of hyphae to a structured and stratified arrangement of tissue. Often, these layers resemble plant [[ground tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]] tissue and are referred to as [[pseudoparenchyma]]tous.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt;

Due to the encapsulating nature of the mantle, the root of the plant symbiont is often affected [[plant morphology#Development|developmentally]]. EcM fungal partners characteristically suppress [[root hair]] development of the host plant with which they are involved.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; Also, through the induction of altered levels of [[cytokinins]] in the phytosymbiont, root branching can be increased.&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Giron | first1=David | display-authors=etal | year=2013 | title=Cytokinins as key regulators in plant–microbe–insect interactions: connecting plant growth and defence | url=http://casas-lab.irbi.univ-tours.fr/fec_12042.pdf | journal=Functional Ecology | volume= 27| issue=3| pages=599–609| doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12042 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These branching patterns can become so extensive that a single consolidated mantle can envelop many root tips at a time, yielding tuberculate or coralloid ectomycorrhizas.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt;

Often, the mantles of different EcM pairs display characteristic [[phenotypic trait|traits]] such as color, extent of branching, and degree of complexity. While [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]] may provide a useful diagnostic in mycobiont [[identification (biology)|identification]], such structures and their connection to the zone of contact are not always available.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; With the advent of more precise genetic techniques, these traits of the mantle are often used in tandem with molecular analyses to more easily determine the identity of the mycorrhizal association.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt;

=== Extraradical hyphae and linkage ===
[[File:Mycorhizes-01.jpg|thumb|Extraradical mycelia (white) on the roots of ''[[Picea glauca]]'' (brown)]]

[[Ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium|Extraradical hyphae]] extend outward from the mantle into the [[soil]], fulfilling the role of the suppressed [[root hairs]] by increasing the surface area of the colonized root. These [[hyphae]] can spread out singly, or in an aggregate arrangement known collectively as a [[mycelial cord|rhizomorph]]. Much as the [[Hartig net]] and mantle, composite hyphal organs can display a wide range of structural difference. Some rhizomorphs are simply parallel, linear collections of hyphae. Others yield more complex organization such as aggregates where the central hyphae possess enlarged diameters, or exhibiting apically extending hyphae that superficially resemble [[meristem]]atic activity.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

The extramatrical [[mycelium|mycelia]] of ectomycorrhizas function largely as [[vascular tissue|transport structures]]. As such, they are often able to spread considerable distances to maintain a large contact area with the soil.&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Agerer | first1=Reinhard | year=2001 | title=Exploration types of ectomycorrhizae | url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/horton/Agerer%202001.pdf | journal=Mycorrhiza | volume=11 | issue=2| pages=107–114 | doi=10.1007/s005720100108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have even shown a relationship between nutrient transport rates and the degree of rhizomorph organization.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seventeen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kammerbauer | first1=H | last2=Agerer | first2=R | last3=Sandermann | first3=H Jr | year=1989 | title=Studies on ectomycorrhiza.

The hyphae extending outward into the soil from one ectomycorrhiza can serve as a source of EcM infection to other nearby plants. This can lead to the formation of [[mycorrhizal networks|common mycorrhizal networks]] (CMNs), which experiments have shown to culminate in the sharing of carbon and nutrients among the connected host plants ''[[in vitro]]''.&lt;ref name="eighteen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Arnebrant | first1=Kristina | display-authors=etal | year=1993 | title=Nitrogen translocation between Alnus glutinosa (L.)

Although [[plant physiology|physiological]] evidence of linkage is difficult to demonstrate, some experiments have been performed where [[carbon-14]] was added to a particular tree and the labeled carbon was later detected in nearby plants and seedlings.&lt;ref name="twentyone"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Amaranthus | first1=M.

It is hypothesized that these CMNs could be involved with other [[ecology|ecological]] processes stemming from a shared nutrient connection, such as seedling establishment, forest [[ecological succession|succession]] and other plant-plant interactions.

=== Fruiting bodies ===
[[File:Truffe noire du Périgord.jpg|thumbnail|left|The hypogeous sporocarp of ''[[Tuber melanosporum]]'', the black Périgord truffle]]

A fourth section, which can be thought of as an extension of the [[extraradical hyphae]], is the reproductive [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting body]] of the EcM fungus. These structures vary widely in their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], although certain aspects are relatively conserved among species. The [[cell wall#Fungal cell walls|fungal cell walls]] are typically composed of [[polysaccharides|complex carbohydrates]], and a great deal of [[nitrogen]] is often bound in these [[cell wall#Fungal cell walls|cell walls]] and [[spores]].&lt;ref name="twentyfive"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Johnson | first1=Christopher N | year=1996 | title=Interactions between mammals and ectomycorrhizal fungi | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534796100537 | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume=11 | issue=12| pages=503–507 | doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(96)10053-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most AM (arbuscular mycorrhizal) fungi, EcM fungi reproduce [[sexual reproduction|sexually]] and produce macroscopic [[sporocarp (fungi)|sporocarps]] in a wide variety of forms.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; It is often necessary for the fungal species involved in the [[symbiosis]] to form ectomycorrhizal relationships in order to complete their [[biological life cycle|life cycles]] through the formation of fruiting bodies.

The structures of the fruit bodies of many species take on classic, well-recognized shapes. These are often hallmark forest constituents such as [[epigeous]] [[mushrooms]] and [[hypogeous]] [[truffles]]. Most of these produce microscopic [[propagules]] of about 10 μm that can disperse over large distances by way of various [[dispersal vector|vectors]], from wind to [[fungivore|mycophagous animals]].&lt;ref name="twentysix"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Peay | first1=Kabir G. | display-authors=etal | year=2007 | title=A strong species–area relationship for eukaryotic soil microbes: island size matters for ectomycorrhizal fungi | url=http://capone.mtsu.edu/sbergema/publications/pdf6%20pine%20island%20ecm.pdf | journal=Ecology Letters | volume=10 | issue=6| pages=470–480 | doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01035.x| pmid=17498146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals are often drawn to hypogeous fruiting bodies because they are rich in nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, minerals and vitamins.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; However, some sources state these nutritive properties are overstated, and it is more likely due to availability at specific times of the year and ease of harvest.&lt;ref name="twentyfive" /&gt;

[[biosurvey|Surveys]] of fruiting bodies are commonly used to assess [[community structure|community composition]] and [[species richness|richness]] in many studies. However, there are many problems with this method, including ephemeral nature of the sporocarps, difficulty in detecting certain forms (such as hypogeous structures), and infrequency of formation in many species.&lt;ref name="twentyseven"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gehring | first1=Catherine A. | display-authors=etal | year=1998 | title=Ectomycorrhizal fungal community structure of pinyon pines growing in two environmental extremes | url=http://www4.nau.edu/gehring/web/Publications/Gehring%20et%20al.%201998.pdf | journal=Ecology | volume=79 | issue=5| pages=1562–1572 | doi=10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[1562:efcsop]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, along with advances in easier and more accurate molecular techniques, it has fallen out of favor when conducting studies where high accuracy and/or resolution is needed.

== Physiology ==
=== Presymbiosis ===
In order to form an ectomycorrhizal connection, the fungal [[hyphae]], originating from a soil [[propagule]] or an established [[mycorrhiza]], must first grow towards the plant’s roots. Afterwards, it must envelope and penetrate the [[root cap]] cells and infect them, thus allowing the symbiotic [[Hartig net]] and associated structures to form. Both the plant and fungal partners must engage in a precise developmental sequence that allows the necessary [[genes]] in each symbiont to be [[gene expression|expressed]] in order to carry out these actions.

In a study concerning a ''[[Tilia americana]]''-''[[Tuber borchii]]'' ectomycorrhiza, 29 [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[organic compounds]] were produced only during the interaction phase between the two partners, suggesting some of these compounds could play a role in the early stages of the formation of the ectomycorrhiza.&lt;ref name="twentyeight"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Menotta | first1=Michele | display-authors=etal | year=2004 | title=Headspace solid‐phase microextraction with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry in the investigation of volatile organic compounds in an ectomycorrhizae synthesis system | url=http://193.146.160.29/gtb/sod/usu/$UBUG/repositorio/10312340_Menotta.pdf | journal=Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry | volume=18 | issue=2| pages=206–210 | doi=10.1002/rcm.1314| pmid=14745771 | bibcode=2004RCMS...18..206M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study on the same ectomycorrhizal association by Menotta ''et al''. showed 58 genes were differentially expressed during the pre-contact phase, most of which were involved in [[secretion|secretory]], apical growth, and infection processes.&lt;ref name="twentynine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Menotta | first1=M. | display-authors=etal | year=2004 | title=Differential gene expression during pre-symbiotic interaction between Tuber borchii Vittad. and Tilia americana L | journal=Current Genetics | volume=46 | issue=3| pages=158–165 | doi=10.1007/s00294-004-0518-4| pmid=15258696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there appears to be a complex set of molecular changes that occurs even before the fungus and host plant make contact.

From the plant hosts, critical [[metabolites]] are released into the [[rhizosphere]] that are capable of triggering [[basidiospore]] [[germination]], growth of hyphae towards the root, and the early steps of the EcM formation.&lt;ref name="thirty"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Martin | first1=Francis | display-authors=1 | last2=et al | year=2001 | title=Developmental cross talking in the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis: signals and communication genes | journal=New Phytologist | volume=151 | issue=1| pages=145–154 | doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2001.00169.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exudates can include, but are not limited to, [[flavonoids]], [[diterpenes]], [[cytokinins]], [[plant hormone|hormones]] and other nutrients. Some host-released metabolites have been shown to stimulate fungal growth in ''[[Pisolithus]]'', modify the branching angle of hyphae, and cause the accumulation of certain fungal molecules that tend to be present in higher quantities during mycorrhiza development.&lt;ref name="thirty" /&gt;

A few fungal genes that appear to be expressed before plant contact include PF6.2 and [[ras subfamily|ras]] from ''[[Laccaria bicolor]]'', and [[ras subfamily|ras]] from ''[[Pisolithus]]''. These discoveries offer further evidence for the induction of fungal genes by diffusible elicitors present in the soil.&lt;ref name="thirty" /&gt;

=== Symbiosis ===
Upon the connection of fungal [[hyphae]] and [[root cap]] cells, growth must continue inwards to the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermal cells]] wherein the hyphae multiply to form layers that will eventually yield a mature mantle. In some associations, such as ''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]''–''[[Pisolithus tinctorius]]'', up to 65 genes can be responsible for the production of the fungal mantle. [[Upregulation]] of genes responsible for [[translation (biology)|translation]] and [[cell growth]], such as eIF4A, and those responsible for [[cell membrane|membrane]] [[biosynthesis|synthesis]] and function, such as the multigene SRAP32 family and [[hydrophobins]], are quite common in EcM mycobionts.&lt;ref name="thirtyone"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Egerton-Warburton | first1=L. M. | display-authors=etal | year=2003 | title=Mycorrhizal fungi | journal=Encyclopedia of Soils in the Environment | volume= | issue=| page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hilbert and Martin discovered 10 out of 520 [[polypeptides]] recorded during their study were unique to the symbiotic condition and subsequently these [[SR protein|symbiosis-related (SR) proteins]] were termed “ectomycorrhizins”.&lt;ref name="thirtytwo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hilbert | first1=J. L. | last2=Martin | first2=F. | year=1988 | title=Regulation of gene expression in ectomycorrhizas | journal=New Phytologist | volume=110 | issue=3| pages=339–346 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1988.tb00270.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilbert et al. showed that major changes in polypeptide synthesis occurred after only a few hours of colonization by the fungus.&lt;ref name="thirtythree"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hilbert | first1=Jean-Louis | last2=Costa | first2=Guy | last3=Martin | first3=Francis | year=1991 | title=Ectomycorrhizin synthesis and polypeptide changes during the early stage of eucalypt mycorrhiza development | url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/97/3/977.full.pdf | journal=Plant Physiology | volume=97 | issue=3| pages=977–984 | doi=10.1104/pp.97.3.977| pmid=16668539 | pmc=1081112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven of the aforementioned ectomycorrhizins were detected, as well as a polypeptide cleansing event as several plant and fungal polypeptides underwent a sharp decrease. Comparative analyses of the [[mRNAs]] from both free-living [[mycelium]] and the EcM mycobionts showed many changes in [[gene expression]], including SRAP32.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

At the root tip interface, researchers have observed a homologue for a [[phosphatidylserine decarboxylase]] (Psd) gene that is consistently [[upregulated]] compared to the extraradical mycelium. This could allow for new membranes to form at the symbiotic interface, which, in turn, could help explain the development of various [[permease]]s that occur in these locations. These new membranes could be largely responsible for nutrient transport from the fungal mycelium to the plant host.&lt;ref name="thirtyfour"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Morel | first1=Mélanie | display-authors=etal | year=2005 | title=Identification of genes differentially expressed in extraradical mycelium and ectomycorrhizal roots during Paxillus involutus-Betula pendula ectomycorrhizal symbiosis | url=http://aem.asm.org/content/71/1/382.full | journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume=71 | issue=1| pages=382–391 | doi=10.1128/aem.71.1.382-391.2005 | pmid=15640212 | pmc=544268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the addition of fungal exudates alone partially mimicked the effect of the mantle in terms of root proliferation, root hair development and [[dichotomy|dichotomous branching]].&lt;ref name="thirty" /&gt; Some of these exudates act [[synergistically]] upon hyphal morphology, as with [[rutin]] (a [[flavonol]]) and [[zeatin]] (a [[cytokinin]]). However, some other [[metabolites]] act [[antagonism (chemistry)|antagonistically]], demonstrated by root development stemming from the release of hypaphorine and [[indole-3-acetic acid]] (IAA). IAA must be tightly regulated in ectomycorrhizal symbioses due to its ability to inhibit root development above certain concentrations.&lt;ref name="thirty" /&gt;

The [[Hartig net]] initially forms from the fully [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] inner layer of the mantle, and penetration occurs in a broad front oriented transversally to the root axis, rather than from a single hyphae.&lt;ref name="thirteen" /&gt; As the hyphae contact the root cells and digest through the [[apoplast|apoplastic space]], some [[spruce]] (''[[Picea abies]]'') and [[eucalyptus]] (''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]'') cells have been shown to produce [[chitinase]]s and [[peroxidases]] that could inhibit Hartig net formation.&lt;ref name="thirty" /&gt; Some plant cells exhibit transcripts for stress- and defense-related [[proteins]] such as [[pathogenesis-related protein|pathogenesis-related]] and [[hypersensitive response]]-induced proteins.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; However, extensive root colonization still occurs in these plants, and the association does not seem to be met with massive cell death associated with [[pathogen]] limitation or defense gene activation. In fact, as the relationship develops in a compatible manner, these hallmarks of resistance seem to diminish by about day 21 after colonization.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Thus, there must be some sort of defense response suppression by the EcM fungi, though details concerning its nature and mechanisms have yet to be determined.

This is well illustrated by the [[monosaccharide]] uptake system in ''[[Amanita muscaria]]''. Carbon uptake requires a [[membrane transport protein|transporter]], AmMST1, that is only expressed when the fungus is cultured at low [[glucose]] levels in multiple mycorrhizal associations. This expression, and increased import of monosaccharides by the fungus, is met with an increase in the supply of [[photoassimilate]]s from the plant host. In the reverse direction, [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase]] (PEPC) moderates the assimilation of [[ammonium]] and the transport of [[amino acids]] from fungus to plant.&lt;ref name="thirtyone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thirtyfour" /&gt;

=== Nutrient uptake and exchange ===
Nitrogen is a crucial component of [[phytochemistry|plant biochemistry]], being involved in such integral compounds as [[chlorophyll]], [[enzymes]] and [[amino acids]]. However, in a vast majority of terrestrial ecosystems it is a limiting nutrient, and readily available nitrogen is in short supply compared to the recalcitrant organic forms that are often shielded from rapid breakdown. Thus, the formation of ectomycorrhizal associations offers an extremely beneficial solution by allowing for the greater exploratory capacity of fungal hyphae, as well as the more efficient acquisition of nitrogen from reserves contained in the [[soil horizon|organic horizon]].&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thirtyfive"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Chalot | first1=Michel | last2=Brun | first2=Annick | year=1998 | title=Physiology of organic nitrogen acquisition by ectomycorrhizal fungi and ectomycorrhizas | journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume=22 | issue=1| pages=21–44 | doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.1998.tb00359.x| pmid=9640645 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that shows that [[glutamine]] is transferred across the root interface, following the assimilation of [[ammonium]] by the fungus. However, the pathways responsible for this conversion are largely unknown, though there are several plausible hypotheses.&lt;ref name="thirtysix"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Smith | first1=S.

As the hyphae of the Hartig net region become more densely packed, they press against the cell walls of the phytobiont’s root cells. Often the fungal and plant cell walls become almost indistinguishable where they meet, thus forming a homogenous interfacial matrix through which nutrients can easily disperse.&lt;ref name="thirtyseven"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Smith | first1=S.

[[File:Ectomycorrhizae002.jpg|thumbnail|right|Ectomycorrhiza with Douglas-fir (''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'') and ''[[Cortinarius]]'' spp.]]

Due to a lack of [[septum#In mycology|septate hyphae]], a [[coenocytic]], [[transfer cell]]-like structure characterizes the Hartig net of many ectomycorrhizas, which facilitates interhyphal transport.&lt;ref name="thirtyfive" /&gt; Wall ingrowths in ''[[Pisonia]]'', for example, resemble those found in other plant species where [[transfer cells]] yield high rates of nutrient transport between [[apoplast]] and [[symplast]].&lt;ref name="thirtyfive" /&gt; Overall, ectomycorrhizal fungi receive approximately 15% of the net [[primary production]] and can provide up to 86% of a host’s nitrogen needs.&lt;ref name="twentysix" /&gt; Carbon allocation has been shown to be correlated with growth rates and nutrient availability. Belowground allocation is highest when nutrient availability is low and when growth rates are reduced.&lt;ref name="thirtynine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hobbie | first1=Erik A | year=2006 | title=Carbon allocation to ectomycorrhizal fungi correlates with belowground allocation in culture studies | url=http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/brunslab/mycorrhizal/papers/hobbie2006.pdf | journal=Ecology | volume=87 | issue=3| pages=563–569 | doi=10.1890/05-0755| citeseerx=10.1.1.501.9516 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phosphorus]] is another typically limiting nutrient in many terrestrial ecosystems. Evidence suggests that phosphorus is transferred largely as inorganic [[phosphate|orthophosphate]].&lt;ref name="thirtyseven" /&gt; Some mat-forming ectomycorrhizas contain [[ribonucleases]] capable of rapidly [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzing]] DNA in order to obtain phosphorus from [[cell nucleus|nuclei]].&lt;ref name="thirtyfive" /&gt;

=== Non-nutritional benefits ===
Extraradical hyphae, and rhizomorphs in particular, also offer invaluable transport of water in many species.

The hyphal sheath enveloping the root tips also acts as a physical barrier shielding plant tissues from pathogens and predators. Furthermore, there has been evidence suggesting that secondary metabolites of fungal partners are capable of acting as biochemical defense mechanisms against pathogenic fungi, nematodes and bacteria that may try to infect the mycorrhizal root.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schrey-et-al-2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Schrey | first1=Silvia D. | display-authors=etal | year=2012 | title=Production of fungal and bacterial growth modulating secondary metabolites is widespread among mycorrhiza-associated streptomycetes | journal=BMC Microbiology | volume=12 | issue=1| pages=164 | doi=10.1186/1471-2180-12-164| pmid=22852578 | pmc=3487804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies also show that EcM fungi are capable of providing tolerance to soils with high concentrations of [[heavy metals]],&lt;ref name="fortythree"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Colpaert | first1=Jan V. | display-authors=etal | year=2011 | title=How metal-tolerant ecotypes of ectomycorrhizal fungi protect plants from heavy metal pollution | url=https://doclib.uhasselt.be/dspace/bitstream/1942/11953/1/fulltext.pdf | journal=Annals of Forest Science | volume=68 | issue=1| pages=17–24 | doi=10.1007/s13595-010-0003-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fortyfour"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Blaudez | first1=Damien | last2=Botton | first2=Bernard | last3=Chalot | first3=Michel | year=2000 | title=Cadmium uptake and subcellular compartmentation in the ectomycorrhizal fungus Paxillus involutus | url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/content/146/5/1109.long | journal=Microbiology | volume=146 | issue=5| pages=1109–1117 | doi=10.1099/00221287-146-5-1109 | pmid=10832638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fortyfive"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sell | first1=Joachim | display-authors=etal | year=2005 | title=Contribution of ectomycorrhizal fungi to cadmium uptake of poplars and willows from a heavily polluted soil | journal=Plant and Soil | volume=277 | issue=1–2| pages=245–253 | doi=10.1007/s11104-005-7084-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[soil salinity|salts]],&lt;ref name="fortysix"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bandou | first1=E. | display-authors=etal | year=2006 | title=The ectomycorrhizal fungus Scleroderma bermudense alleviates salt stress in seagrape (Coccoloba uvifera L.) seedlings | journal=Mycorrhiza | volume=16 | issue=8| pages=559–565 | doi=10.1007/s00572-006-0073-6 | pmid=17033816 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fortyseven"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Liang | first1=Y.

=== Ectendomycorrhiza ===
Although EcM fungal hyphae form the [[Hartig net]] outside of root cells, penetration of plant cortical cells occasionally occurs. Many species of ectomycorrhizal fungi are capable of forming mycorrhizas with other plant species where this penetration is the normal mode of mycorrhizal formation. These associations represent a form of symbiosis intermediate to [[arbuscular mycorrhizas]] and ectomycorrhizas, termed ectendomycorrhizas. Like EcM fungi, both the mantle and Hartig net are present, though sometimes at reduced density. However, more like AM fungi, the hyphae penetrate the host’s root intracellularly. Thus, the same species of fungi can be categorized as ecto- or ectendomycorrhizas depending on the host species.&lt;ref name="fortyeight"&gt;Quoreshi, Ali M. "The use of mycorrhizal biotechnology in restoration of disturbed ecosystem." Mycorrhizae: Sustainable Agriculture and Forestry.

=== Biogeography and environmental gradients ===
Ectomycorrhizal fungi are found throughout [[taiga|boreal]], [[temperate forest|temperate]] and [[tropical forest|tropical]] ecosystems, primarily among the dominant woody-plant-producing families (3.1.a).&lt;ref name="twentysix" /&gt; In these more [[mesic habitat|mesic]] environments supporting [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous]] and [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|mixed coniferous and deciduous forests]], the EcM produce [[proteases]] and [[acid phosphatase]] enzymes to access organic forms of both nitrogen and phosphorus.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt;

Many of the fungal families most common in temperate forests (e.g. [[Russulaceae]], [[Boletaceae]], [[Thelephoraceae]]) are also quite widespread in the [[southern hemisphere]] and tropical [[dipterocarp]] forests. While there are differences between the fungal makeup of these different ecosystems, the ectomycorrhizal fungal component shows much greater similarities than the minimal overlap that occurs between dominant plant families in temperate and tropical forests (3.5.a).&lt;ref name="fortynine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Peay | first1=Kabir G. | display-authors=etal | year=2010 | title=Potential link between plant and fungal distributions in a dipterocarp rainforest: community and phylogenetic structure of tropical ectomycorrhizal fungi across a plant and soil ecotone | journal=New Phytologist | volume=185 | issue=2| pages=529–542 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03075.x | pmid=19878464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence to suggest that communities of EcM fungi differ across soil type gradients in a tropical system. However, the particular study notes that the mechanism driving this differentiation is not clear, and the variance could be in response to the soil physiochemical environment, plant community, or both (3.5.a). Other studies offer evidence to strengthen the idea that EcM communities are indeed affected by soil environment both in the field&lt;ref name="fifty"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Swaty | first1=Randy L. | display-authors=etal | year=1998 | title=Temporal variation in temperature and rainfall differentially affects ectomycorrhizal colonization at two contrasting sites | url=http://www4.nau.edu/gehring/web/Publications/Swaty%20et%20al.%201998.pdf | journal=New Phytologist | volume=139 | issue=4| pages=733–739 | doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00234.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fiftyone"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Toljander | first1=Jonas F. | display-authors=etal | year=2006 | title=Species composition of an ectomycorrhizal fungal community along a local nutrient gradient in a boreal forest | journal=New Phytologist | volume=170 | issue=4| pages=873–884 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01718.x | pmid=16684245}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the lab.&lt;ref name="fiftytwo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Brearley | first1=Francis Q | year=2006 | title=Differences in the growth and ectomycorrhizal community of ''Dryobalanops lanceolata'' (Dipterocarpaceae) seedlings grown in ultramafic and non-ultramafic soils | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071706002574 | journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry | volume=38 | issue=12| pages=3407–3410 | doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.05.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fiftythree"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Brearley | first1=Francis Q. | display-authors=etal | year=2007 | title=How does light and phosphorus fertilisation affect the growth and ectomycorrhizal community of two contrasting dipterocarp species? | journal=Plant Ecology | volume=192 | issue=2| pages=237–249 | doi=10.1007/s11258-007-9325-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies indicate that ectomycorrhizal fungi might be at odds with the general [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity|latitudinal gradient of diversity]] (LGD). Data sets, free from inconclusive fruit-body surveys and largely relying on more accurate [[sequencing]] and [[microarray]] technologies, indicate that EcM fungi may be at enhanced diversity in the [[temperate climate|temperate zone]].&lt;ref name="twentysix" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiftyfour"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Tedersoo | first1=Leho | last2=Nara | first2=Kazuhide | year=2010 | title=General latitudinal gradient of biodiversity is reversed in ectomycorrhizal fungi | journal=New Phytologist | volume=185 | issue=2| pages=351–354 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03134.x | pmid=20088976}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that many of the causal mechanisms proposed to explain the LGD pattern might be inapplicable, or in need of modification, in reference to EcM. Though this relationship is far from certain, there exist some hypotheses to explain the plausibility of this phenomenon: 1) EcM fungi may have evolved at higher latitudes with [[Pinaceae]] hosts, and are subsequently inferior at competition in [[tropical climates]], 2) host lineages might be more diverse in temperate conditions, and well developed soil and [[soil horizons]] in temperate regions allow for higher [[niche differentiation]] and species accumulation, and 3) tropical EcM hosts are more sparsely distributed, yielding small isolated forest islands that may reduce the population sizes and subsequent richness of EcM fungi.&lt;ref name="fiftyfour" /&gt;

This third hypothesis is expounded on in a study demonstrating that habitat size also plays an important role in determining the [[species richness]] and assemblage structure of ectomycorrhizal fungi, namely that richness is reduced in smaller and more isolated habitat areas. The same study determined that spatial turnover of soil fungi actually occurs on scales more similar to macro-organisms.&lt;ref name="twentysix" /&gt;

Similar to studies concerning nitrogen [[eutrophication]], EcM fungal makeup over an [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] nitrogen gradient show similar trends. Species richness declined dramatically with increasing nitrogen inputs, with over 30 species represented at low nitrogen sites and only 9 at high nitrogen sites.&lt;ref name="fiftyfive"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lilleskov | first1=Erik A. | display-authors=etal | year=2002 | title=Belowground ectomycorrhizal fungal community change over a nitrogen deposition gradient in Alaska | url=http://nature.berkeley.edu/brunslab/papers/lilleskov2002a.pdf | journal=Ecology | volume=83 | issue=1| pages=104–115 | doi=10.2307/2680124| jstor=2680124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that as nitrogen increases, [[taxa]] shift from those specialized for low nitrogen conditions to those specialized for phosphorus uptake in low phosphorus, high nitrogen, acidified conditions.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiftyfive" /&gt;

=== Host specificity and community responses ===
Across most EcM host lineages, there appears to be low levels of [[host (biology)#Host range|specificity]], as EcM plants tend to form symbioses with many distantly related fungi.&lt;ref name="fiftysix"&gt;Molina, Randy, Hugues Massicotte, and James M. Trappe. "Specificity phenomena in mycorrhizal symbioses: community-ecological consequences and practical implications." Mycorrhizal functioning: an integrative plant-fungal process (1992): 357-423.&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of this system are twofold: 1) seedlings are more likely to form mycorrhizas in a wide array of habitats, thus extending range and setting, and 2) EcM mycobionts can differ in their ability to access nutrients, thus allowing host plants better access to these minerals.&lt;ref name="fiftyseven"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bruns | first1=Thomas D. | last2=Bidartondo | first2=Martin I. | last3=Taylor | first3=D. Lee | year=2002 | title=Host specificity in ectomycorrhizal communities: what do the exceptions tell us? | url=http://intl-icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/2/352.full | journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume=42 | issue=2| pages=352–359 | doi=10.1093/icb/42.2.352 | pmid=21708728}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species of ''[[Alnus]]'' exhibit a very narrow range of fungal symbionts, but these fungi are not from related lineages. Thus it is the mycobionts that show phylogenetic specificity, not the [[alders]].&lt;ref name="fiftyseven" /&gt;

A major exception to the general rule outlined above is exemplified by [[myco-heterotrophy|mycoheterotrophic]] plants that utilize ectomycorrhizas for their carbon needs. These plants, from the subfamily [[monotropaceae|Monotropoideae]], exhibit high specificity for the EcM fungi they parasitize, although different [[monotropaceae|monotrope]] species target a rather wide array of fungal lineages.&lt;ref name="fiftyseven" /&gt;

While the plant hosts exhibit low specificity, EcM fungi exhibit various levels of specificity, and the costs and benefits to their specialization are not well understood.&lt;ref name="fiftyeight"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dickie | first1=Ian A. | display-authors=etal | year=2010 | title=Co‐invasion by Pinus and its mycorrhizal fungi | journal=New Phytologist | volume=187 | issue=2| pages=475–484 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03277.x | pmid=20456067}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fiftynine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wolfe | first1=Benjamin E. | last2=Klironomos | first2=John N. | year=2005 | title=Breaking new ground: soil communities and exotic plant invasion | url=http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/pringle/documents/Wolfe_Klironomos_2005.pdf | journal=BioScience | volume=55 | issue=6| pages=477–487 | doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2005)055[0477:bngsca]2.0.co;2| bibcode=1985BioSc..35..499W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sixty"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Borowicz | first1=Victoria A. | last2=Juliano | first2=Steven A. | year=1991 | title=Specificity in host-fungus associations: Do mutualists differ from antagonists? | journal=Evolutionary Ecology | volume=5 | issue=4| pages=385–392 | doi=10.1007/BF02214155}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example is the suilloid group, a [[monophyletic]] assemblage containing the genera ''[[Suillus]]'', ''[[Rhizopogon]]'', ''[[Gomphidius]]'' and others.

The establishment of [[mycorrhizal networks|common mycelial networks]] is thought to have effects upon the plant community involved with them through their ectomycorrhizal connections.

=== Roles in invasion ===
[[File:Plantation SW of Loch Gynack - geograph.org.uk - 1325009.jpg|thumbnail|Pine plantation, probably inoculated with fungal spores to allow beneficial ectomycorrhizas to form]]

Mycorrhizas have been regarded as the most prevalent symbiotic condition on earth, and as such they are essential to plant nutrition in terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, even alien plants often require mycorrhizal symbionts for the establishment and spread into foreign environments. Due to the low specificity of the vast majority of [[arbuscular mycorrhizas]], AM plants often become [[invasive species|invasive]] quickly and easily, and as such, the invasions are not necessarily accompanied by a simultaneous AM fungal invasion. However, because ectomycorrhizal symbioses present a range of specificities, [[introduced species|exotic]] [[forestry]] has often relied upon the introduction of compatible EcM fungi to the foreign landscape in order to ensure the success of [[forest#Forest plantations|forest plantations]] and the like.&lt;ref name="sixtynine"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Díez | first1=Jesús | title=Invasion biology of Australian ectomycorrhizal fungi introduced with eucalypt plantations into the Iberian Peninsula | url=http://nature.berkeley.edu/brunslab/mycorrhizal/papers/diez2005.pdf | journal=Issues in Bioinvasion Science | volume=2005 | issue=| pages=3–15 | doi=10.1007/1-4020-3870-4_2| year=2005 | isbn=978-1-4020-2902-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is most common in [[eucalypts]] and [[pine]]s, which are [[obligate parasite|obligate]] ectomycorrhizal trees in natural conditions.&lt;ref name="sixtynine" /&gt; This is evidenced by the struggle of establishment of pines in the southern hemisphere until the anthropogenic buildup of [[soil inoculant|soil inoculums]].&lt;ref name="seventy"&gt;Richardson, David M., ed. Ecology and biogeography of Pinus. Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Australian eucalypts and [[acacias]] have evolved in isolation from the EcM fungi associated with many other temperate trees such as ''[[Pinus]]'' and ''[[Quercus]]''. Thus, much like pines in the southern hemisphere, many ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' plantations required inoculation by EcM fungi from their native landscape. In both cases, EcM networks allowed for the naturalization of the [[introduced species]], followed quickly by competition for resources with native plants and invasion into novel habitats.&lt;ref name="sixtynine" /&gt;

Many EcM species co-invade without the help of human activity, however. Members of [[Pinaceae]] represent another prime example of this convention, often invading habitats along with specific EcM fungi from the genera ''[[Suillus]]'' and ''[[Rhizopogon]]''.&lt;ref name="fiftyeight" /&gt; There are, however, ectomycorrhiza-forming fungi with [[cosmopolitan distribution]]s. These EcM fungi allow non-native plant species to form mutualisms that are not novel in environments that are, thus bypassing the need for co-invasion with specific EcM fungi from the native ecosystem.&lt;ref name="fiftyeight" /&gt;

Dominant native plants are capable of inhibition of EcM fungi on the roots of neighboring plants through the release of chemical compounds or through competitive interactions.&lt;ref name="seventyone"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Walker | first1=John F. | display-authors=etal | year=1999 | title=Suppression of ectomycorrhizae on canopy tree seedlings in Rhododendron maximum L.

Invasive [[garlic mustard]], ''[[Alliaria petiolata]]'', and its [[allelopathy|allelochemical]] [[benzyl]] [[isothiocyanate]] were shown to inhibit the growth of three species of EcM fungi grown on [[pinus strobus|white pine]] (''[[Pinus strobus]]'') seedlings.&lt;ref name="seventytwo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wolfe | first1=Benjamin E. | display-authors=etal | year=2008 | title=The invasive plant Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) inhibits ectomycorrhizal fungi in its introduced range | journal=Journal of Ecology | volume=96 | issue=4| pages=777–783 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01389.x| bibcode=2009JEcol..98...74B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in EcM communities can have drastic effects on nutrient uptake and community composition of native trees, which can in turn have far-reaching ecological ramifications.&lt;ref name="fiftynine" /&gt;

Namely, there was a [[priority effect]] that significantly favored the original colonists to be the most dominant, except in cases involving fungal species at a natural competitive disadvantage.&lt;ref name="seventythree" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seventyfour" /&gt; This disadvantage appears to be related to the proportion of root tips colonized, and those species incapable of colonizing a sufficient proportion of host roots do not typify this priority effect.&lt;ref name="seventythree" /&gt;

Many other [[biotic factor|biotic]] and [[abiotic factors]] can mediate competition among EcM fungi, such as temperature, [[soil pH]], [[soil moisture]], [[host (biology)#Host range|host specificity]], and competitor number.&lt;ref name="seventyfour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seventyfive" /&gt; The results of many studies concerning these factors indicate that these interactions are largely environmentally context-dependent. These aspects can often lead to “checkerboard” distribution patterns, where certain species occupy locations that are mutually exclusive of the other species.&lt;ref name="seventyfour" /&gt;

EcM communities continue to exhibit rare EcM fungal constituents that have not been excluded, despite intense competition. Thus, mechanisms must exist that maintain diverse levels of EcM fungi.&lt;ref name="seventyfour" /&gt; This coexistence can be summed up in four non-mutually exclusive possibilities illustrated by Bruns: niche partitioning, disturbance-related patch dynamics, density-dependent mortality and competitive networks.&lt;ref name="seventyseven"&gt;Bruns, Thomas D.

[http://nature.berkeley.edu/brunslab/papers/bruns1995.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also some evidence for competition between EcM fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

However, not all bacteria exhibit beneficial effects, and there exists some bacteria whose effects are quite opposite to those of MHBs, thus inhibiting ectomycorrhizal formation.&lt;ref name="eightyone" /&gt;

=== Faunal interactions ===
[[File:Chanterelle.jpg|thumbnail|left|The edible epigeous fruiting body of ''[[Cantharellus cibarius]]'', the golden chanterelle]]

Many ectomycorrhizal fungi are known to rely upon [[mammals]] for the [[spore#Dispersal|dispersal of spores]], particularly those fungi with [[hypogeous]] fruiting bodies. Many species of small mammals exhibit a high degree of [[mycophagy]], ingesting a wide taxonomic range of fungi. These mammals are often drawn to hypogeous fruiting bodies because they are rich in nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, minerals and vitamins. However, some sources state these nutritive properties are overstated, and it is more likely due to availability at specific times of the year, ease of harvest, and patchy nature of distribution.&lt;ref name="twentyfive" /&gt;

The spores of these fungi are dispersed either by the actions of being unearthed and broken apart, or by ingestion and subsequent excretion. Some studies even suggest that passage through an animal's gut promotes the [[germination]] of these spores, although it is by no means necessary for a majority of fungal species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Claridge | first1=A. W. | display-authors=etal | year=1999 | title=Mycophagy by small mammals in the coniferous forests of North America: nutritional value of sporocarps of Rhizopogon vinicolor, a common hypogeous fungus | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B | volume=169 | issue=3| pages=172–178 | doi=10.1007/s003600050208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Cork | first1=Steven J. | last2=Kenagy | first2=G.

Many other sporocarps are grazed upon by [[invertebrate]]s such as [[mollusc|mollusks]] and fly larvae, some of which are even tolerant to the toxic [[alpha-amanitin|α-amanitin]]. Belowground, populations of [[nematode]]s and [[springtail]]s are maintained by consumption of fungal tissue.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; There are also studies concerning EcM fungi and [[arthropod]]s. The ectomycorrhizal fungus ''[[Laccaria bicolor]]'' has been found to lure and kill [[springtail]]s to obtain nitrogen, some of which may then be transferred to the mycorrhizal host plant. In a study by Klironomos and Hart, [[eastern white pine]] inoculated with ''[[L. bicolor]]'' was able to derive up to 25% of its nitrogen from springtails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Klironomos | first1=John N. | last2=Hart | first2=Miranda M. | year=2001 | title=Food-web dynamics: Animal nitrogen swap for plant carbon | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v410/n6829/abs/410651b0.html | journal=Nature | volume=410 | issue=6829| pages=651–652 | doi=10.1038/35070643 | pmid=11287942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, edible fungus plays a role in many societies throughout the world, as well. Many [[epigeous]] [[mushroom]]s are collected and consumed on a regular basis, and more recent commercial harvesting is beginning to play a larger economic role in certain locales.&lt;ref name="eightyfour"&gt;Arnolds, Eef. "Conservation and management of natural populations of edible fungi."

== Plant production ==
=== Agriculture ===
Ectomycorrhizal fungi do not play a large role in [[agricultural]] and [[horticultural]] systems. Most of the economically relevant [[crop]] plants that form mycorrhizas tend to form them with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.&lt;ref name="eightysix"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Munyanziza | first1=E. | last2=Kehri | first2=H.

Thus, it is possible that agriculture indirectly affects nearby ectomycorrhizal species and habitats, such as increased fertilization decreasing sporocarp production.&lt;ref name="eightyseven"&gt;Amaranthus, Michael P.

=== Forestry ===
In commercial [[forestry]], the [[transplanting]] of crop trees in new locales often requires an accompanying ectomycorrhizal partner. This is especially true of trees that have a high degree of specificity for their mycobiont, or trees that are being planted far from their native habitat among novel fungal species. This has been shown time and again in [[plantations]] involving obligate ectomycorrhizal trees, such as ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' and ''[[Pinus]]'' species.&lt;ref name="sixtynine" /&gt; Mass planting of these species often require human addition of inoculum from native EcM fungi in order for the trees to prosper.

Thus, these EcM fungi have to be species that are capable of being grown in bulk. After being added to various soil mixtures, the mutualism can begin as seedlings are grown in [[plant nursery|nurseries]] or plantations. This is already becoming quite commonplace, and there are many companies that are beginning to sell a variety of mycorrhizal inoculum, ''[[Pisolithus tinctorius]]'' being quite widespread among the EcM fungi.&lt;ref name="eightyseven" /&gt;

Sometimes ectomycorrhizal plantation species, such as [[pine]] and [[eucalyptus]], are planted and promoted for their ability to act as a [[carbon sink|sink]] for atmospheric carbon. However, the ectomycorrhizal fungi of these species also tend to deplete soil carbon over relatively short periods of time.&lt;ref name="eightynine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Scott | first1=Neal A. | display-authors=etal | year=1999 | title=Soil carbon storage in plantation forests and pastures: land‐use change implications | journal=Tellus B | volume=51 | issue=2| pages=326–335 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0889.1999.00015.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there is a great deal of mounting resistance to using tree plantations as general solutions to combatting rising [[carbon dioxide]] levels.&lt;ref name="ninety"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Chapela | first1=Ignacio H. | display-authors=etal | year=2001 | title=Ectomycorrhizal fungi introduced with exotic pine plantations induce soil carbon depletion | url=http://nature.berkeley.edu/brunslab/papers/chapela2001.pdf | journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry | volume=33 | issue=12| pages=1733–1740 | doi=10.1016/s0038-0717(01)00098-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restoration ===
Ectomycorrhizas provide many benefits to their host plants, with enhanced nutrient uptake, growth and establishment in disturbed habitats ranked highly among them.&lt;ref name="fortyeight" /&gt; Thus, it seems logical that EcM fungi could be used in [[restoration ecology|restoration]] projects aimed at re-establishing native plant species in [[ecosystems]] disrupted by a variety of issues.&lt;ref name="ninetyone"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Kernaghan | first1=G. | display-authors=etal | year=2002 | title=In Vitro Selection of Boreal Ectomycorrhizal Fungi for Use in Reclamation of Saline‐Alkaline Habitats | url=http://faculty.msvu.ca/fungal_ecology/Publi_Pdf/In%20vitro%20selection%20of%20ectomycorrhizal%20fungi%20for%20reclamation%20of%20alkaline-saline%20habitats.pdf | journal=Restoration Ecology | volume=10 | issue=1| pages=43–51 | doi=10.1046/j.1526-100x.2002.10105.x| bibcode=1990reec.book.....J }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing a certain degree of protection to seedlings in harsh circumstances, such as increased [[soil salinity|salinity]] or [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] [[pollution]], the fungi are also instrumental in improving [[soil quality]].&lt;ref name="ninetyone" /&gt; They are able to achieve this through allowing the establishment of early vegetation and subsequent organic litter, [[erosion#Prevention and remediation|preventing erosion]], and binding soil particles together yielding stability and soil aggregation.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; Since the disappearance of mycorhizal fungi from a habitat constitutes a major soil disturbance event, its re-addition is an important part of establishing vegetation and restoring habitats.&lt;ref name="fortyeight" /&gt;

== Global change ==
=== Heavy metals ===

[[Heavy metal (chemistry)|Heavy metals]] are well known [[Metal toxicity|toxic]] agents for living organisms. High soil concentrations of [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] such as [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[cadmium]], [[lead]], [[nickel]], and [[chromium]] affect basic [[Metabolism|metabolic processes]] and can lead to [[cell damage]] and death. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are susceptible to heavy metal contamination. However, there seems to be widespread heavy metal tolerance in these fungi, with many species having the ability to colonize soils both with and without high heavy metal content. This said, there are a few examples of [[ecotype]]s associated with harsh soil chemistry,&lt;ref name="Colpaert,2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Colpaert | first1=J. | year=2011 | title=How metal-tolerant ecotypes of ectomycorrhizal fungi protect plants from heavy metal pollution | journal=Annals of Forest Science | volume=68 | issue=| pages=17–24 | doi=10.1007/s13595-010-0003-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating such inhospitable soils can lead to fungal evolutionary change.

Heavy metal excess interferes with basic cell functions, affecting the metabolism, growth, and differentiation of ectomycorrhizal fungi. High heavy metal concentrations may lead to the blocking of functional groups of important molecules such as enzymes, displacement and/or substitution of essential metals from molecules involved in cell processes, modification of molecule conformation and denaturation, as well as membrane disruption.&lt;ref name="Gadd,1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gadd | first1=G.M. | year=1993 | title=Interaction of fungi with toxic metals | journal=New Phytologist | volume=124 | issue=| pages=25–60 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1993.tb03796.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of high heavy metal concentrations on ectomycorrhizal fungi vary by metal and fungal species and range from high fungal sensitivity to wide fungal tolerance. Overall, ectomycorrhizal fungi show high constitutive tolerance with many species being able to survive in toxic and non-toxic environments. However, there are cases of [[Ecotype|populations locally adapted]] to tolerate harsh chemical environments &lt;ref name="Colpaert,2011" /&gt;

Fungi exhibit [[detoxification]] mechanisms that ensure heavy metal concentrations in their cells do not exceed a certain threshold. These mechanisms include reducing heavy metal uptake, promoting heavy metal sequestration and storage within the cell, and heavy metal excretion. Heavy metal uptake can be reduced by [[sorption]] and metabolic inactivation at the cell wall and apoplast level.&lt;ref name="Colpaert,2011" /&gt; Ectomycorrhizal fungi also have the ability to [[Molecular binding|bind]] considerable amounts of heavy metals,&lt;ref name="Colpaert,2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blaudez,2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Blaudez | first1=D. | last2=Jacob | first2=C. | last3=Turnau | first3=K. | last4=Colpaert | first4=J.V. | last5=Ahonen-Jonnath | first5=U. | last6=Finlay | first6=R. | last7=Botton | first7=B. | last8=Chalot | first8=M. | year=2000 | title=Differential responses of ectomycorrhizal fungi to heavy metals in vitro | journal=Mycological Research | volume=104 | issue=11| pages=1366–1371 | doi=10.1017/s0953756200003166}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet it remains unclear if binding is an effective way to prevent heavy metals to enter fungal cells. Once inside the cell, heavy metals can be immobilized in organo-metal complexes, made soluble, transformed into [[metallothionein]]s, involved in metal sequestration and/or stored in vacuoles in chemically inactive forms. [[Antioxidant]] detoxification systems may also be in place, reducing the production of [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] and protecting the fungal cell.&lt;ref name=Gadd,2004 &gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gadd | first1=G.M. | year=2004 | title=Microorganisms and heavy metal toxicity | journal=Microbial Ecology | volume=4 | issue=4| pages=303–317 | doi=10.1007/bf02013274| pmid=24232222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bellion,2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bellion | first1=M. | last2=Courbot | first2=M | last3=Jacob | first3=C. | display-authors=etal | year=2006 | title=Extracellular and cellular mechanism sustaining metal tolerance in ectomycorrhizal fungi | journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters | volume=254 | issue=2| pages=173–181 | doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2005.00044.x| pmid=16445743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungi can export metals from the cytoplasm to the apoplast.

Little is known about the environmental requirements or limitations of ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, many species are found to live in toxic and non-toxic environments and genetic differences between populations from such habitats have rarely been reported.

More specifically, the accumulation of heavy metals in the fungal tissue is prevented through a mechanism that efficiently exports metals to the outside of the cell. When compared to non-mycorrhizal fine roots, ectomycorrhizae may contain very high concentrations of trace elements, including toxic metals (cadmium, silver) or chlorine.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cejpková|first1=J|last2=Gryndler|first2=M|last3=Hršelová|first3=H|last4=Kotrba|first4=P|last5=Řanda|first5=Z|last6=Greňová|first6=I|last7=Borovička|first7=J|title=Bioaccumulation of heavy metals, metalloids, and chlorine in ectomycorrhizae from smelter-polluted area|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=218|pages=176–185|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2016.08.009|pmid=27569718|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749116306790?via%3Dihub|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollution and Phytoremediation ===
One type of [[pollution]] that poses considerable challenges and threats to plants is the concentration of [[heavy metals]] in the soil. Although many metals are important nutrients in small quantities, such as [[copper]], [[iron]] and [[zinc]], in high concentrations they pose a particularly devastating risk due to their toxicities.&lt;ref name="fortythree" /&gt; See Ectomycorrhizas and heavy metals for a description of how heavy metals affect ectomycorrhizal fungi.

Another problem faced by many plants is high [[soil salinity]]. One study shows that some EcM fungi are capable of improving salt tolerance in a species of poplar by altering leaf physiology. Though the symbiotic contact takes place at the root interface, the fungus was able to alter such leaf traits as concentration of nutrients and [[phytohormones]], and ratios of [[fatty acids]] in order to combat leaf [[chlorosis]] and shedding.&lt;ref name="ninetythree"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Luo | first1=Zhi-Bin | display-authors=etal | year=2011 | title=The ectomycorrhizal fungus (Paxillus involutus) modulates leaf physiology of poplar towards improved salt tolerance | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098847211001006 | journal=Environmental and Experimental Botany | volume=72 | issue=2| pages=304–311 | doi=10.1016/j.envexpbot.2011.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[coccoloba uvifera|seagrape]] seedlings, the EcM fungus ''[[Scleroderma (genus)|Scleroderma]] [[List of Scleroderma species|bermudense]]'' was able to alleviate salt stress. In the seagrape tissue, there was a decrease in both [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]], but an increase in [[potassium]] and [[phosphorus]], implying this trend might represent a mechanism to explain the observed tolerance.&lt;ref name="fortysix" /&gt; Another study even identified 22 proteins differentially produced under salt stress of the EcM fungus ''[[Boletus edulis]]''. They mostly concerned cellular processes such as [[metabolism]], [[cell cycle]] control and stress tolerance, with 14 proteins being [[upregulated]] and 8 down.&lt;ref name="fortyseven" /&gt;

Many species of ectomycorrhizal fungi, most notably those from [[Cortinariaceae]], are capable of becoming [[phytoremediation#Phytoextraction|hyperaccumulators]] of [[radionuclides]]. This is similar to their ability to absorb heavy metals, though mechanisms are largely unresearched. In a study in Sweden, sporocarps of an ectomycorrhizal fungus contained ten times the concentration of [[radiocesium]] than the surrounding litter, while saprotrophic species exhibited nearly half that value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Nikolova | first1=Ivanka | last2=Johanson | first2=Karl J. | last3=Dahlberg | first3=Anders | year=1997 | title=Radiocaesium in fruitbodies and mycorrhizae in ectomycorrhizal fungi | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X96000380 | journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity | volume=37 | issue=1| pages=115–125 | doi=10.1016/S0265-931X(96)00038-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species are capable of decomposing [[persistent organic pollutant]]s (POPs) as well, such as [[organochloride]]s and [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs). Species such as ''[[Suillus variegatus]]'' and ''[[Paxillus involutus]]'' were able to [[mineralization (soil science)|mineralize]] [[2,4-dichlorophenol]] both in [[axenic culture]] and in an EcM association with ''[[Pinus sylvestris]]''.&lt;ref name="rhizorem"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Meharg | first1=Andrew A. | last2=Cairney | first2=John WG | year=2000 | title=Ectomycorrhizas—extending the capabilities of rhizosphere remediation? | url=http://elmu.umm.ac.id/file.php/1/jurnal/S/Soil%20Biology%20And%20Chemistry/Vol32.Issue11-12.oct2000/1686.pdf | journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry | volume=32 | issue=11| pages=1475–1484 | doi=10.1016/s0038-0717(00)00076-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intact rhizosphere of ''[[Pinus taeda]]'' also exhibited the capacity to mineralize [[tetrachloroethylene]] under natural conditions.&lt;ref name="rhizorem" /&gt; The EcM fungi ''[[Radiigera|Radiigera atrogleba]]'' and ''[[Hysterangium|Hysterangium garneri]]'' were capable of decomposing up to 80% of a particular PCB when tested.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt;

However, not every problem is alleviated by the presence of EcM fungi. There is some evidence that points to an inhibition in degrading recalcitrant pollutants such as [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]]. It is thought that these fungi take away nutrients from other degraders that would be better at degrading these compounds, therefore inhibiting their actions.&lt;ref name="ninetyfour"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Joner | first1=Erik J. | last2=Leyval | first2=Corinne | last3=Colpaert | first3=Jan V. | year=2006 | title=Ectomycorrhizas impede phytoremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) both within and beyond the rhizosphere | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749105004902 | journal=Environmental Pollution | volume=142 | issue=1| pages=34–38 | doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2005.09.007| pmid=16325973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate change ===
[[Climate change]] can induce a number of changes on the environment, and subsequently, ectomycorrhizal communities. Many of these studies are in their infancy, but it is clear that they often exhibit some effect. In some studies, elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels increased fungal mycelium growth due to increased carbon allocation&lt;ref name="ninetyfive"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fransson | first1=Petra MA | last2=Taylor | first2=Andy FS | last3=Finlay | first3=Roger D. | year=2005 | title=Mycelial production, spread and root colonisation by the ectomycorrhizal fungi Hebeloma crustuliniforme and Paxillus involutus under elevated atmospheric CO2 | journal=Mycorrhiza | volume=15 | issue=1| pages=25–31 | doi=10.1007/s00572-003-0289-7 | pmid=14750001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased EcM root colonization by 14%.&lt;ref name="ninetysix"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Garcia | first1=Maria O. | display-authors=etal | year=2008 | title=Mycorrhizal dynamics under elevated CO2 and nitrogen fertilization in a warm temperate forest | url=https://webfiles.uci.edu/treseder/public/Publications/Garcia_etal_2008.pdf | journal=Plant and Soil | volume=303 | issue=1–2| pages=301–310 | doi=10.1007/s11104-007-9509-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels can affect different EcM associations quite differently, and many studies with negligible effects have also been performed.&lt;ref name="ninetyseven"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Compant | first1=Stéphane | last2=Marcel | last3=Der Heijden | first3=GA Van | last4=Sessitsch | first4=Angela | year=2010 | title=Climate change effects on beneficial plant–microorganism interactions | journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology | volume=73 | issue=2| pages=197–214 | doi=10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.00900.x | pmid=20528987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased temperatures also appear to affect EcM communities, though the results cover a range of responses. Some studies have shown that [[cellular respiration|respiration]] is reduced in certain species in response to warming,&lt;ref name="ninetyeight"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Malcolm | first1=Glenna M. | display-authors=etal | year=2008 | title=Acclimation to temperature and temperature sensitivity of metabolism by ectomycorrhizal fungi | journal=Global Change Biology | volume=14 | issue=5| pages=1169–1180 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01555.x | bibcode=2008GCBio..14.1169M }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others demonstrated increased total colonization of host plants.&lt;ref name="fifty" /&gt; Similarly, it appears that only some EcM species are affected by [[drought]], as there are studies yielding results across the spectrum. However, many species provide protection against root [[desiccation]] and improve water uptake ability of the roots. In this sense, they provide a general benefit to plants during times of drought (though they may themselves may be affected over time).&lt;ref name="ninetyseven" /&gt;

Regardless of how variably these EcM symbioses may change in response to the changing environmental conditions, it is clear that they do at least change. Thus, as more research is compiled, and as patterns and general effects emerge, we will have a better understanding of the no doubt critical consequences climate change has on EcM communities.

=== Conservation ===
As it becomes more apparent that belowground organisms and functions heavily influence forest productivity, recovery and stability, ectomycorrhiza are becoming a prime focus for [[conservation biology|conservation]] ecologists.&lt;ref name="eightyseven" /&gt; The recent decline of many species of EcM fungi in [[Europe]] has also allowed the importance of EcM disappearance to gain traction in more widespread conservation circles. Many factors are contributing to the decline, including reduced tree vitality, conversion of forests to other uses, [[pollution]] and [[soil acidification|acidification of forest soils]].&lt;ref name="eightyseven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ninetynine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Arnolds | first1=E. E. F. | year=1991 | title=Decline of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Europe | journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment | volume=35 | issue=2| pages=209–244 | doi=10.1016/0167-8809(91)90052-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation efforts need to be based on protecting species over their entire host range and habitat, not just at particular sites or with particular species.&lt;ref name="eightyseven" /&gt; Studies have shown that even in many different soil types and locations EcM fungal richness is relatively conserved, but that the community makeup of sites can still be quite different. Trees are often dominated by a few fungal strains, but these fungi are not the same on all trees in nearby areas, and show considerable spatial variation. This leads to the conclusion that conservation efforts should be aimed even at atypical sites, such as abiotically stressful locales, in order to conserve the full gamut of EcM fungal partners and plant host species.&lt;ref name="twentyseven" /&gt;

The growing importance of EcM fungi in the field of conservation is evidenced by the creation of the [[Northwest Forest Plan]], which offers guidelines to maintain habitats and [[endangered species]]. This includes creating databases for endangered fungi and developing strategies to manage and protect them. Another example in a similar vein is the creation of the European Council for the Conservation of Fungi, which works with education about, and the documentation of, endangered fungi on the continent.&lt;ref name="eightyseven" /&gt; Organizations and groups like these are valuable in disseminating knowledge concerning conservation practices for scientists and the public. They also help compile solutions for fields like [[forest management]] that act to preemptively halt EcM declines.

[[File:Prescribed burn in a Pinus nigra stand in Portugal.JPG|thumbnail|right|Prescribed burn in a stand of ''Pinus nigra''. What effects could this have on the ectomycorrhizas below ground?]]

In many cases, forest managers and scientists must take steps to ensure the health of economically important native forests, such as the maintenance of: 1) refuge plants and reservoir hosts after harvesting to preserve the EcM fungal community, 2) mature trees to provide seedlings with a diverse array of EcM fungi, and 3) [[old-growth]] stands with their more diverse macro- and [[microhabitats]] that support an abundance of EcM fungi.&lt;ref name="onehundred"&gt;Wiensczyk, Alan M., et al. "Ectomycorrhizae and forestry in British Columbia: A summary of current research and conservation strategies." ''Journal of Ecosystems and Management'' 2.1 (2002). [http://www.siferp.org/sites/default/files/publications/jem_archive/ISS2/vol2_no1_art6.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Other strategies include the preservation of natural [[forest floor]] constituents and retention of woody debris and substrates. In one study concerning [[Douglas-fir]] seedlings, removal of forest floor debris and soil compaction decreased EcM fungal diversity and abundance by 60%.&lt;ref name="onehundredone"&gt;Amaranthus, Michael P., et al. Soil compaction and organic matter affect conifer seedling nonmycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal root tip abundance and diversity. Forest Service research paper. No. PB--97-104301/XAB; FSRP-PNW--494. Forest Service, Portland, OR (United States). Pacific Northwest Research Station, 1996. [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=406027]&lt;/ref&gt; Another study focused on the removal of pinegrass, and found that its removal had similar reductions in diversity and richness of EcM fungi.&lt;ref name="twentytwo" /&gt;

Some strategies, such as [[controlled burn|prescribed burns]], have complicated ramifications due to conflicting evidence. Some claim that fires have negative effects on EcM survival and diversity,&lt;ref name="onehundredtwo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dahlberg | first1=Anders | display-authors=etal | year=2001 | title=Post-fire legacy of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in the Swedish boreal forest in relation to fire severity and logging intensity | journal=Biological Conservation | volume=100 | issue=2| pages=151–161 | doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(00)00230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other show neutral, or even positive effects.&lt;ref name="onehundred" /&gt;&lt;ref name="onehundredthree"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mah | first1=Karen | display-authors=etal | year=2001 | title=The impacts of broadcast burning after clear-cutting on the diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with hybrid spruce seedlings in central British Columbia | url=http://web.unbc.ca/forestry/Hugues/pdf%20files/The%20impacts%20of%20broadcast%20burning.pdf | journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research | volume=31 | issue=2| pages=224–235 | doi=10.1139/x00-158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, different organisms and different community structures will react to such burns differently. With that in mind, these diverse effects are to be expected, and research on how specific communities could respond, rather than sweeping generalizations, would be much more beneficial in the long run.

''[[Ex situ]]'' strategies for conservation of fungi are also currently under way, including ectomycorrhizal fungi, but a great deal of work is still needed. There are large culture collections maintained throughout the world; however, there are only approximately 11,500 species included. This represents only about 17% of known fungal species, and around 1% of the world’s estimated species of fungi.&lt;ref name="onehundredfour"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hawksworth | first1=David L | year=1991 | title=The fungal dimension of biodiversity: magnitude, significance, and conservation | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953756209808101 | journal=Mycological Research | volume=95 | issue=6| pages=641–655 | doi=10.1016/S0953-7562(09)80810-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A great deal of worldwide cooperation is needed in order to secure the fungal genetic resource for the future.

In [[evolutionary biology]] and  [[population genetics]], the '''error threshold''' (or '''critical mutation rate''') is a limit on the number of [[base pairs]] a self-replicating molecule may have before mutation will destroy the information in subsequent generations of the molecule. The error threshold is crucial to understanding "Eigen's paradox".

The error threshold is a concept in the origins of life ([[abiogenesis]]), in particular of very early life, before the advent of [[DNA]]. It is postulated that the first self-replicating molecules might have been small [[ribozyme]]-like [[RNA]] molecules. These molecules consist of strings of base pairs or "digits",  and their order is a code that directs how the molecule interacts with its environment. All replication is subject to mutation error. During the replication process, each digit has a certain probability of being replaced by some other digit, which changes the way the molecule interacts with its environment, and may increase or decrease its fitness, or ability to reproduce, in that environment.

== Fitness landscape ==
{{main article|Fitness landscape}}
It was noted by [[Manfred Eigen]] in his 1971 paper (Eigen 1971) that this mutation process places a limit on the number of digits a molecule may have. If a molecule exceeds this critical size, the effect of the mutations become overwhelming and a runaway mutation process will destroy the information in subsequent generations of the molecule. The error threshold is also controlled by the fitness landscape for the molecules. Molecules that differ only by a few mutations may be thought of as "close" to each other, while those that differ by many mutations are distant from each other. Molecules that are very fit, and likely to reproduce, have a "high" fitness, those less fit have "low" fitness.

These ideas of proximity and height form the intuitive concept of the "fitness landscape". If a particular sequence and its neighbors have a high fitness, they will form a [[quasispecies model|quasispecies]] and will be able to support longer sequence lengths than a fit sequence with few fit neighbors, or a less fit neighborhood of sequences. Also, it was noted by Wilke (Wilke 2005) that the error threshold concept does not apply in portions of the  landscape where there are lethal mutations, in which the induced mutation yields zero fitness and prohibits the molecule from reproducing.

==Eigen's Paradox==

'''Eigen's paradox'''  is one of the most intractable puzzles in the study of the origins of life.  It is thought that the error threshold concept described above limits the size of self replicating molecules to perhaps a few hundred digits,  yet almost all life on earth requires  much longer molecules to encode their genetic information. This problem is handled in living cells by enzymes that repair mutations, allowing the encoding molecules to reach sizes on the order of millions of base pairs. These large molecules must, of course, encode the very enzymes that repair them, and herein lies Eigen's paradox, first put forth by [[Manfred Eigen]] in his 1971 paper (Eigen 1971). Simply stated, Eigen's paradox amounts to the following:

*  Without error correction enzymes, the maximum size of a replicating molecule is about 100 base pairs.
* For a replicating molecule to encode error correction enzymes, it must be substantially larger than 100 bases.

This is a [[The chicken or the egg|chicken-or-egg]] kind of a paradox, with an even more difficult solution. Which came first, the large genome or the error correction enzymes? A number of solutions to this paradox have been proposed:

* Stochastic corrector model (Szathmáry &amp; Maynard Smith, 1995). In this proposed solution, a number of primitive molecules of say, two different types, are associated with each other in some way, perhaps by a capsule or "cell wall". If their reproductive success is enhanced by having, say, equal numbers in each cell, and reproduction occurs by division in which each of various types of molecules are randomly distributed among the "children", the process of selection will promote such equal representation in the cells, even though one of the molecules may have a selective advantage over the other.
* Relaxed error threshold (Kun et al., 2005) - Studies of actual ribozymes indicate that the mutation rate can be substantially less than first expected - on the order of 0.001 per base pair per replication. This may allow sequence lengths of the order of 7-8 thousand base pairs, sufficient to incorporate rudimentary error correction enzymes.

==A simple mathematical model==
Consider a 3-digit molecule [A,B,C] where A, B, and C can take on the values 0 and 1. There are eight such sequences ([000], [001], [010], [011], [100], [101], [110], and [111]). Let's say that the [000] molecule is the most fit; upon each replication it produces an average of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; copies, where &lt;math&gt;a&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. This molecule is called the "master sequence". The other seven sequences are less fit; they each produce only 1 copy per replication. The replication of each of the three digits is done with a mutation rate of μ. In other words, at every replication of a digit of a sequence, there is a probability &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; that it will be erroneous; 0 will be replaced by 1 or vice versa. Let's ignore double mutations and the death of molecules (the population will grow infinitely), and divide the eight molecules into three classes depending on their [[Hamming distance]] from the master sequence:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
|'''Hamming&lt;br&gt;distance''' || '''Sequence(s)'''
|-
|align=center| 0 
|align=center| [000]
|-
|align=center| 1 
|align=center| [001]&lt;br&gt;[010]&lt;br&gt;[100]
|-
|align=center| 2 
|align=center| [110]&lt;br&gt;[101]&lt;br&gt;[011]
|-
|align=center| 3 
|align=center| [111]
|}

Note that the number of sequences for distance ''d'' is just the [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\tbinom L d &lt;/math&gt; for L=3, and that each sequence can be visualized as the vertex of an L=3  dimensional cube,  with each edge of the cube specifying a mutation path in which the change Hamming distance is either zero or ±1. It can be seen that, for example, one third of the mutations of the [001] molecules will produce [000] molecules, while the other two thirds will produce the class 2 molecules [011] and [101]. We can now write the expression for the child populations &lt;math&gt;n'_i&lt;/math&gt; of class ''i'' in terms of the parent populations &lt;math&gt;n_j&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;n'_i=\sum_{j=0}^3 w_{ij}n_j&lt;/math&gt;

where the matrix '''w''’ that incorporates natural selection and mutation, according to [[quasispecies model]], is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}=
\begin{bmatrix}
a\cdot Q&amp;3a\cdot\mu&amp;0&amp;0\\
\mu&amp;Q&amp;2\mu&amp;0\\
0&amp;2\mu&amp;Q&amp;\mu\\
0&amp;0&amp;3\mu&amp;Q
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Q=(1-\mu)^L&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that an entire molecule will be replicated successfully. The [[eigenvectors]] of the '''w''' matrix will yield the equilibrium population numbers for each class. For example, if the mutation rate μ is zero, we will have Q=1, and the equilibrium concentrations will be &lt;math&gt;[n_0,n_1,n_2,n_3]=[1,0,0,0]&lt;/math&gt;. The master sequence, being the fittest will be the only one to survive. If we have a replication fidelity of Q=0.95 and genetic advantage of a=1.05, then the equilibrium concentrations will be roughly &lt;math&gt;[0.33,0.38,0.24,0.06]&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen that the master sequence is not as dominant, however, sequences with low Hamming distance are in majority. If we have a replication fidelity of Q approaching 0, then the equilibrium concentrations will be roughly &lt;math&gt;[0.125,0.375,0.375,0.125]&lt;/math&gt;. This is a population with equal number of each of 8 sequences. (If we had perfectly equal population of all sequences, we would have populations of [1,3,3,1]/8.)

If we now go to the case where the number of base pairs is large, say L=100, we obtain behavior that resembles a phase transition. The plot below on the left shows a series of equilibrium concentrations divided by the binomial coefficient &lt;math&gt;\tbinom {100} k &lt;/math&gt;.
(This multiplication will show the population for an individual sequence at that distance,  and will yield a flat line for an equal distribution.) The selective advantage of the master sequence is set at a=1.05.  The horizontal axis is the Hamming distance ''d''&amp;nbsp;. The various curves are for various total  mutation rates &lt;math&gt;(1-Q)&lt;/math&gt;. It is seen that for low values of the total mutation rate, the population consists of a [[quasispecies]] gathered in the neighborhood of the master sequence. Above a total mutation rate of about 1-Q=0.05, the distribution quickly spreads out to populate all sequences equally. The plot below on the right shows the fractional population of the master sequence as a function of the total mutation rate. Again it is seen that below a critical mutation rate of about 1-Q=0.05, the master sequence contains most of the population, while above this rate, it contains only about &lt;math&gt;2^{-L}\approx 10^{-30}&lt;/math&gt; of the total population.

[[Image:ErrorThreshold1.png|thumb|left|325px|Population numbers as a function of Hamming distance ''d'' and mutation rate (1-Q). The horizontal axis ''d''&amp;nbsp; is the Hamming distance of the molecular sequences from the master sequence. The vertical axis is the logarithm of population for any sequence at that distance divided by total population (thus the division of ''n&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' by the binomial coefficient). The total number of digits per sequence is L=100, and the master sequence has a selective advantage of a=1.05.]]

[[Image:ErrorThreshold2.png|thumb|right|325px|The population of the master sequence as a fraction of the total population (''n'') as a function of overall mutation rate (1-Q). The total number of digits per sequence is L=100, and the master sequence has a selective advantage of a=1.05. The "phase transition" is seen to occur at roughly 1-Q=0.05.]]

{{clear}}

It can be seen that there is a sharp transition at a value of ''1-Q''&amp;nbsp; just a bit larger than 0.05. For mutation rates above this value, the population of the master sequence drops to practically zero. Above this value, it dominates.

In the limit as ''L'' approaches infinity, the system does in fact have a phase transition at a critical value of Q: &lt;math&gt;Q_c=1/a.&lt;/math&gt;. One could think of the overall mutation rate (1-Q) as a sort of "temperature", which "melts" the fidelity of the molecular sequences above the critical "temperature" of &lt;math&gt;1-Q_c&lt;/math&gt;. For faithful replication to occur, the information must be "frozen" into the genome.

=== Independent emergence on Earth ===
{{main|Abiogenesis}}
Life on Earth is based on [[carbon]] and water. Carbon provides stable frameworks for complex chemicals and can be easily extracted from the environment, especially from [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="PiP" /&gt; There is no other chemical element whose properties are similar enough to carbon's to be called an analogue; [[silicon]], the element directly below carbon on the [[periodic table]], does not form very many complex stable molecules, and because most of its compounds are water-insoluble, it would be more difficult for organisms to extract. The elements [[boron]] and [[phosphorus]] have more complex chemistries, but suffer from other limitations relative to carbon. Water is an excellent [[solvent]] and has two other useful properties: the fact that ice floats enables aquatic organisms to survive beneath it in winter; and its molecules have [[electric charge|electrically negative]] and positive ends, which enables it to form a wider range of compounds than other solvents can. Other good solvents, such as [[ammonia]], are liquid only at such low temperatures that chemical reactions may be too slow to sustain life, and lack water's other advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bennett|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/?id=lEQKnip7St4C&amp;pg=PA84 82–85]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms based on [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|alternative biochemistry]] may, however, be possible on other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schulze-Makuch |first1=Dirk |authorlink1=Dirk Schulze-Makuch |last2=Irwin |first2=Louis N. |date=April 2006 |title=The prospect of alien life in exotic forms on other worlds |journal=[[Naturwissenschaften]] |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=155–72 |bibcode=2006NW.....93..155S |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0078-6 |pmid=16525788 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on how life might have emerged from non-living chemicals focuses on three possible starting points: [[self-replication]], an organism's ability to produce offspring that are very similar to itself; metabolism, its ability to feed and repair itself; and external [[cell membrane]]s, which allow food to enter and waste products to leave, but exclude unwanted substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peretó |first=Juli |year=2005 |title=Controversies on the origin of life |url=http://www.im.microbios.org/0801/0801023.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[International Microbiology]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=23–31 |pmid=15906258 |accessdate=2007-10-07 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on abiogenesis still has a long way to go, since theoretical and [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] approaches are only beginning to make contact with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Szathmáry |first=Eörs |authorlink=Eörs Szathmáry |date=February 3, 2005 |title=Life: In search of the simplest cell |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7025/full/433469a.html |journal=Nature |volume=433 |issue=7025 |pages=469–470 |bibcode=2005Natur.433..469S |doi=10.1038/433469a |accessdate=2008-09-01 |pmid=15690023 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luisi |first1=Pier Luigi |authorlink1=Pier Luigi Luisi |last2=Ferri |first2=Francesca |last3=Stano |first3=Pasquale |date=January 2006 |title=Approaches to semi-synthetic minimal cells: a review |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |bibcode=2006NW.....93....1L |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0056-z |pmid=16292523 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the simplest members of the [[Three-domain system|three modern domains]] of life use [[DNA]] to record their "[[Genetic memory (biology)|recipes]]" and a complex array of [[RNA]] and [[protein]] molecules to "read" these instructions and use them for growth, maintenance and self-replication.

==== Metabolism first: Iron–sulfur world ====
{{main|Iron–sulfur world theory}}
A series of experiments starting in 1997 showed that early stages in the formation of proteins from inorganic materials including [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]] could be achieved by using [[iron(II) sulfide|iron sulfide]] and [[nickel sulfide]] as [[catalyst]]s. Most of the steps required temperatures of about {{convert|100|°C|°F}} and moderate pressures, although one stage required {{convert|250|°C|°F}} and a pressure equivalent to that found under {{convert|7|km|mi}} of rock. Hence it was suggested that self-sustaining synthesis of proteins could have occurred near hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wächtershäuser |first=Günter |authorlink=Günter Wächtershäuser |date=August 25, 2000 |title=Life as We Don't Know It |journal=Science |volume=289 |issue=5483 |pages=1307–1308 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5483.1307 |pmid=10979855 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The clay hypothesis ====

RNA is complex and there are doubts about whether it can be produced non-biologically in the wild.&lt;ref name="RNANaturalSynthesisProblems" /&gt; Some [[clay]]s, notably [[montmorillonite]], have properties that make them plausible accelerators for the emergence of an RNA world: they grow by self-replication of their [[crystal]]line pattern; they are subject to an analog of natural selection, as the clay "species" that grows fastest in a particular environment rapidly becomes dominant; and they can catalyze the formation of RNA molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cairns-Smith|1968|pp=57–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this idea has not become the scientific consensus, it still has active supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ferris |first=James P. |date=June 1999 |title=Prebiotic Synthesis on Minerals: Bridging the Prebiotic and RNA Worlds |journal=[[The Biological Bulletin]] |volume=196 |issue=3 |pages=311–314 |doi=10.2307/1542957 |jstor=1542957 |pmid=10390828 |ref=harv}} "This paper was originally presented at a workshop titled ''Evolution: A Molecular Point of View''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in 2003 reported that montmorillonite could also accelerate the conversion of [[fatty acid]]s into "bubbles," and that the "bubbles" could encapsulate RNA attached to the clay. These "bubbles" can then grow by absorbing additional lipids and then divide. The formation of the earliest cells may have been aided by similar processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hanczyc |first1=Martin M. |last2=Fujikawa |first2=Shelly M. |last3=Szostak |first3=Jack W. |authorlink3=Jack W.

===Chromatin, nucleus, endomembrane system, and mitochondria===
Eukaryotes may have been present long before the oxygenation of the atmosphere,&lt;ref name="GlansdorffXuLabedan2008LUCA" /&gt; but most modern eukaryotes require oxygen, which their [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] use to fuel the production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], the internal energy supply of all known cells.&lt;ref name="HedgesBlairEtAl2004molecularTimescaleOfEukaryoteEvolution" /&gt; In the 1970s it was proposed and, after much debate, widely accepted that eukaryotes emerged as a result of a sequence of endosymbiosis between "[[prokaryote]]s." For example: a [[predator]]y microorganism invaded a large prokaryote, probably an [[archaea]]n, but the attack was neutralized, and the attacker took up residence and evolved into the first of the mitochondria; one of these [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]]s later tried to swallow a photosynthesizing cyanobacterium, but the victim survived inside the attacker and the new combination became the ancestor of [[plant]]s; and so on. After each endosymbiosis began, the partners would have eliminated unproductive duplication of genetic functions by re-arranging their genomes, a process which sometimes involved transfer of genes between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margulis|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vellai |first1=Tibor |last2=Vida |first2=Gábor |date=August 7, 1999 |title=The origin of eukaryotes: the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=266 |issue=1428 |pages=1571–1577 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0817 |pmc=1690172 |pmid=10467746 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Selosse |first1=Marc-André |last2=Abert |first2=Béatrice |last3=Godelle |first3=Bernard |date=March 1, 2001 |title=Reducing the genome size of organelles favours gene transfer to the nucleus |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953470002084X |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=135–141 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(00)02084-X |accessdate=2015-01-29 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were originally [[sulfur]]- or [[hydrogen]]-metabolising endosymbionts, and became oxygen-consumers later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pisani |first1=Davide |last2=Cotton |first2=James A. |last3=McInerney |first3=James O. |date=August 2007 |title=Supertrees Disentangle the Chimerical Origin of Eukaryotic Genomes |journal=[[Molecular Biology and Evolution]] |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=1752–1760 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msm095 |pmid=17504772 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, mitochondria might have been part of eukaryotes' original equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=Michael W. |last2=Burger |first2=Gertraud |last3=Lang |first3=B.

=== Plastids ===
[[Plastid]]s, the superclass of [[organelle]]s of which [[chloroplast]]s are the best-known exemplar, are thought to have originated from [[Endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic]] cyanobacteria.

== Sexual reproduction and multicellular organisms ==

=== Evolution of sexual reproduction ===
{{Main|Evolution of sexual reproduction|Sexual reproduction}}
The defining characteristics of [[sexual reproduction]] in eukaryotes are [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]]. There is much [[genetic recombination]] in this kind of reproduction, in which offspring receive 50% of their genes from each parent,&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /&gt; in contrast with [[asexual reproduction]], in which there is no recombination. Bacteria also exchange DNA by [[bacterial conjugation]], the benefits of which include resistance to [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotic]]s and other [[toxin]]s, and the ability to utilize new [[metabolite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holmes|Jobling|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, conjugation is not a means of reproduction, and is not limited to members of the same species&amp;nbsp;– there are cases where bacteria transfer DNA to plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Christie, P. J. 2001 294–305"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christie |first=Peter J. |date=April 2001 |title=Type IV secretion: intercellular transfer of macromolecules by systems ancestrally related to conjugation machines |journal=[[Molecular Microbiology (journal)|Molecular Microbiology]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=294–305 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2001.02302.x |pmid=11309113 |pmc=3922410 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, bacterial transformation is clearly an adaptation for transfer of DNA between bacteria of the same species. Bacterial transformation is a complex process involving the products of numerous bacterial genes and can be regarded as a bacterial form of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Michod |first1=Richard E. |last2=Bernstein |first2=Harris |last3=Nedelcu |first3=Aurora M. |date=May 2008 |title=Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens |url=http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Infection, Genetics and Evolution]] |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=267–285 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002 |pmid=18295550 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Harris |last2=Bernstein |first2=Carol |date=July 2010|title=Evolutionary Origin of Recombination during Meiosis |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=60 |issue=7 |pages=498–505 |doi=10.1525/bio.2010.60.7.5 |ref=harv|bibcode=1985BioSc..35..499W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process occurs naturally in at least 67 prokaryotic species (in seven different phyla).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnsborg |first1=Ola |last2=Eldholm |first2=Vegard |last3=Håvarstein |first3=Leiv Sigve |date=December 2007 |title=Natural genetic transformation: prevalence, mechanisms and function |journal=Research in Microbiology |volume=158 |issue=10 |pages=767–778 |doi=10.1016/j.resmic.2007.09.004 |pmid=17997281 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes may have evolved from bacterial transformation.&lt;ref name="novapublishers.com"&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|Bernstein|Michod|2012|pp=1–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Also see [[Evolution of sexual reproduction#Origin of sexual reproduction]].)

The disadvantages of sexual reproduction are well-known: the genetic reshuffle of recombination may break up favorable combinations of genes; and since males do not directly increase the number of offspring in the next generation, an asexual population can out-breed and displace in as little as 50 generations a sexual population that is equal in every other respect.&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Neiman |first1=Maurine |title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences |last2=Jokela |first2=Jukka |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Life Sciences]] |year=2010 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=978-0-470-01617-6 |doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0001716.pub2|chapter=Sex: Advantage }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the great majority of animals, plants, fungi and [[protist]]s reproduce sexually.

The [[Red Queen hypothesis]] suggests that sexual reproduction provides protection against [[parasite]]s, because it is easier for parasites to evolve means of overcoming the defenses of genetically identical [[cloning|clone]]s than those of sexual species that present moving targets, and there is some experimental evidence for this. However, there is still doubt about whether it would explain the survival of sexual species if multiple similar clone species were present, as one of the clones may survive the attacks of parasites for long enough to out-breed the sexual species.&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /&gt; Furthermore, contrary to the expectations of the Red Queen hypothesis, Kathryn A. Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hanley |first1=Kathryn A. |last2=Fisher |first2=Robert N. |last3=Case |first3=Ted J. |date=June 1995 |title=Lower Mite Infestations in an Asexual Gecko Compared With Its Sexual Ancestors |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=418–426 |doi=10.2307/2410266 |ref=harv|jstor=2410266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, biologist Matthew Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Matthew A. |date=September 1994 |title=Pathogens and sex in plants |journal=Evolutionary Ecology |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=560–584 |doi=10.1007/bf01238258 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexey Kondrashov]]'s ''deterministic mutation hypothesis'' (DMH) assumes that each organism has more than one harmful mutation and the combined effects of these mutations are more harmful than the sum of the harm done by each individual mutation. If so, sexual recombination of genes will reduce the harm that bad mutations do to offspring and at the same time eliminate some bad mutations from the [[gene pool]] by isolating them in individuals that perish quickly because they have an above-average number of bad mutations. However, the evidence suggests that the DMH's assumptions are shaky because many species have on average less than one harmful mutation per individual and no species that has been investigated shows evidence of [[synergy]] between harmful mutations.&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /&gt; (Further criticisms of this hypothesis are discussed in the article [[Evolution of sexual reproduction#Removal of deleterious genes]])

The random nature of recombination causes the relative abundance of alternative traits to vary from one generation to another. This [[genetic drift]] is insufficient on its own to make sexual reproduction advantageous, but a combination of genetic drift and natural selection may be sufficient. When chance produces combinations of good traits, natural selection gives a large advantage to lineages in which these traits become genetically linked. On the other hand, the benefits of good traits are neutralized if they appear along with bad traits. Sexual recombination gives good traits the opportunities to become linked with other good traits, and mathematical models suggest this may be more than enough to offset the disadvantages of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="OttoGerstein2006WhySex" /&gt; Other combinations of hypotheses that are inadequate on their own are also being examined.&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /&gt;

The following hypotheses attempt to explain how and why sex evolved:
*It may have enabled organisms to repair genetic damage.&lt;ref name="dna-repair"&gt;{{cite journal

*Sexual reproduction may have originated from [[Selfish DNA|selfish parasitic genetic elements]] propagating themselves by transfer to new hosts.&lt;ref name="hickey"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hickey, D. | title = Selfish DNA: A Sexually-Transmitted Nuclear Parasite | journal = Genetics | volume = 101 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 519–31 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6293914 | pmc = 1201875}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It may have evolved from [[cannibalism]], where some of the victim's DNA was incorporated into the cannibal organism.&lt;ref name="TatianaSexAdvice"/&gt;
*Sexual reproduction may have evolved from ancient [[haloarchaea]] through a combination of [[jumping genes]], and swapping [[plasmid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Extreme Microbes | first1=S. | last1=DasSarma | doi = 10.1511/2007.65.1024 | journal=American Scientist | year=2007 | volume=95 |issue=3| pages= 224–231 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Or it may have evolved as a form of [[vaccination]] in which infected hosts exchanged weakened [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] copies of parasitic DNA as protection against more virulent versions. The [[meiosis]] stage of sexual reproduction may then have evolved as a way of removing the symbiotes.&lt;ref name="Sterrer"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sterrer, W. | title = On the origin of sex as vaccination | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 216 | pages = 387–96 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1006/jtbi.2002.3008

[[Bacteria]] also exchange [[DNA]] by [[bacterial conjugation]], the benefits of which include resistance to [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotics]] and other [[toxin]]s, and the ability to utilize new [[metabolite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holmes |first1=Randall K. |last2=Jobling |first2=Michael G. |year=1996 |chapter=Genetics |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7908/ |editor-last=Baron |editor-first=Samuel |title=Medical Microbiology |edition=4th |location=Galveston, TX |publisher=[[University of Texas Medical Branch]] |at=Exchange of Genetic Information |isbn=0-9631172-1-1 |lccn=95050499 |oclc=33838234 |pmid=21413277 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, conjugation is not a means of reproduction and is not limited to members of the same species, and there are cases where bacteria transfer DNA to plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Christie, P. J. 2001 294–305"/&gt; Nevertheless, it may be an example of the "selfish genetic element" hypothesis, as it transfers DNA by means of such a "selfish gene," the [[F-plasmid]].&lt;ref name="TatianaSexAdvice"/&gt;

The adaptive function of sex today remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by John A. Birdsell and [[Christopher Wills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birdsell|Wills|2003|pp=27–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypotheses discussed above all depend on the possible beneficial effects of random genetic variation produced by genetic recombination. An alternative view is that sex arose and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and that the genetic variation produced is an occasionally beneficial byproduct.&lt;ref name="novapublishers.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|Hopf|Michod|1987|pp=323–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multicellularity ===
{{main|Multicellular organism }}
The simplest definitions of "multicellular," for example "having multiple cells," could include [[Colony (biology)|colonial]] cyanobacteria like ''[[Nostoc]]''. Even a technical definition such as "having the same genome but different types of cell" would still include some [[genus|genera]] of the green algae [[Volvox]], which have cells that specialize in reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Graham |authorlink1=Graham Bell (biologist) |last2=Mooers |first2=Arne O. |year=1997 |title=Size and complexity among multicellular organisms |url=http://biology.mcgill.ca/faculty/bell/articles/70.BellMooers_1997_BJLS60.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Biological Journal of the Linnean Society]] |volume=60 |issue=3|pages=345–363 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01500.x |accessdate=2015-02-02 |ref=hav}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multicellularity evolved independently in organisms as diverse as [[sponge]]s and other animals, fungi, plants, [[brown algae]], cyanobacteria, [[slime mold]]s and [[myxobacteria]].&lt;ref name="Fedonkin2003OriginOfMetazoa"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fedonkin |first=Mikhail A. |authorlink=Mikhail Fedonkin |date=March 31, 2003 |title=The origin of the Metazoa in the light of the Proterozoic fossil record |url=http://www.vend.paleo.ru/pub/Fedonkin_2003.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Paleontological Research |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=9–41 |doi=10.2517/prpsj.7.9 |accessdate=2008-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226122725/http://www.vend.paleo.ru/pub/Fedonkin_2003.pdf |archivedate=February 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaiser |first=Dale |authorlink=A.

The initial advantages of multicellularity may have included: more efficient sharing of nutrients that are digested outside the cell,&lt;ref name="Koschwanezetal2011PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koschwanez |first1=John H. |last2=Foster |first2=Kevin R. |last3=Murray |first3=Andrew W. |date=August 9, 2011 |title=Sucrose Utilization in Budding Yeast as a Model for the Origin of Undifferentiated Multicellularity |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=e1001122 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001122 |pmid=21857801 |pmc=3153487 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased resistance to predators, many of which attacked by engulfing; the ability to resist currents by attaching to a firm surface; the ability to reach upwards to filter-feed or to obtain sunlight for photosynthesis;&lt;ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" /&gt; the ability to create an internal environment that gives protection against the external one;&lt;ref name="Bonner1999OriginsOfMulticellularity" /&gt; and even the opportunity for a group of cells to behave "intelligently" by sharing information.&lt;ref name="NakagakiYamadaTóth2000Intelligence"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nakagaki |first1=Toshiyuki |last2=Yamada |first2=Hiroyasu |last3=Tóth |first3=Ágota |date=September 28, 2000 |title=Intelligence: Maze-solving by an amoeboid organism |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6803/abs/407470a0.html |journal=Nature |volume=407 |issue=6803 |pages=470 |doi=10.1038/35035159 |pmid=11028990 |accessdate=2008-09-03 |ref=harv|bibcode=2000Natur.407..470N }}&lt;/ref&gt; These features would also have provided opportunities for other organisms to diversify, by creating more varied environments than flat microbial mats could.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" /&gt;

Multicellularity with differentiated cells is beneficial to the organism as a whole but disadvantageous from the point of view of individual cells, most of which lose the opportunity to reproduce themselves. In an asexual multicellular organism, rogue cells which retain the ability to reproduce may take over and reduce the organism to a mass of undifferentiated cells. Sexual reproduction eliminates such rogue cells from the next generation and therefore appears to be a prerequisite for complex multicellularity.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" /&gt;

The available evidence indicates that eukaryotes evolved much earlier but remained inconspicuous until a rapid diversification around 1 Ga. The only respect in which eukaryotes clearly surpass bacteria and archaea is their capacity for variety of forms, and sexual reproduction enabled eukaryotes to exploit that advantage by producing organisms with multiple cells that differed in form and function.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" /&gt;

By comparing the composition of transcription factor families and regulatory network motifs between unicellular organisms and multicellular organisms, scientists found there are many novel transcription factor families and three novel types of regulatory network motifs in multicellular organisms, and novel family transcription factors are preferentially wired into these novel network motifs which are essential for multicullular development. These results propose a plausible mechanism for the contribution of novel-family transcription factors and novel network motifs to the origin of multicellular organisms at transcriptional regulatory level.&lt;ref name="MBE_1767"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jin JP, et al. | title= An Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory map reveals distinct functional and evolutionary features of novel transcription factors|journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution | date=July 2015 |volume=32 |issue=7|doi=10.1093/molbev/msv058 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/7/1767.full |pmid=25750178 |pmc=4476157 |pages=1767–1773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is still debate about the classification of these specimens, mainly because the diagnostic features which allow taxonomists to classify more recent organisms, such as similarities to living organisms, are generally absent in the Ediacarans.

The [[small shelly fauna]] are a very mixed collection of fossils found between the Late Ediacaran and [[Cambrian Series 3|Middle Cambrian]] periods. The earliest, ''[[Cloudinid|Cloudina]]'', shows signs of successful defense against predation and may indicate the start of an [[evolutionary arms race]].

=== Evolution of terrestrial antioxidants ===
Oxygen is a potent [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]] whose accumulation in terrestrial atmosphere resulted from the development of [[photosynthesis]] over 3 Ga, in cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), which were the most primitive oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Brown algae accumulate inorganic mineral [[antioxidant]]s such as [[rubidium]], [[vanadium]], [[zinc]], iron, [[copper]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[iodine]] which is concentrated more than 30,000 times the concentration of this element in seawater. Protective endogenous antioxidant enzymes and exogenous dietary antioxidants helped to prevent oxidative damage. Most marine mineral antioxidants act in the cells as essential [[trace element]]s in [[redox]] and antioxidant [[Metalloprotein|metalloenzymes]].

When plants and animals began to enter rivers and land about 500 Ma, environmental deficiency of these marine mineral antioxidants was a challenge to the evolution of terrestrial life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Venturi |first=Sebastiano |date=September 2011 |title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine |journal=Current Chemical Biology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=155–162 |doi=10.2174/187231311796765012 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crockford |first=Susan J. |date=August 2009 |title=Evolutionary roots of iodine and thyroid hormones in cell-cell signaling |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=155–166 |doi=10.1093/icb/icp053 |pmid=21669854 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of “new” endogenous antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]], [[polyphenol]]s, [[flavonoid]]s, [[tocopherol]]s, etc. A few of these appeared more recently, in last 200–50 Ma, in [[fruit]]s and [[flower]]s of [[angiosperm]] plants.

In fact, angiosperms (the dominant type of plant today) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the [[Late Jurassic]] period. Plants employ antioxidants to defend their structures against [[reactive oxygen species]] produced during photosynthesis. Animals are exposed to the same oxidants, and they have evolved endogenous enzymatic antioxidant systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Venturi |first1=Sebastiano |last2=Donati |first2=Francesco M. |last3=Venturi |first3=Alessandro |last4=Venturi |first4=Mattia |date=August 2000 |title=Environmental Iodine Deficiency: A Challenge to the Evolution of Terrestrial Life? |journal=[[Thyroid (journal)|Thyroid]] |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=727–729 |doi=10.1089/10507250050137851 |pmid=11014322 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iodine]] is the most primitive and abundant electron-rich essential element in the diet of marine and terrestrial organisms, and as iodide acts as an [[electron donor]] and has this ancestral antioxidant function in all iodide-concentrating cells from primitive marine algae to more recent terrestrial vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Küpper |first1=Frithjof C. |last2=Carpenter |first2=Lucy J. |last3=McFiggans |first3=Gordon B. |last4=Palmer |first4=Carl J. |last5=Waite |first5=Tim J. |last6=Boneberg |first6=Eva-Maria |last7=Woitsch |first7=Sonja |last8=Weiller |first8=Markus |last9=Abela |first9=Rafael |date=May 13, 2008 |title=Iodide accumulation provides kelp with an inorganic antioxidant impacting atmospheric chemistry |journal=Proc.

Life on land required plants to become internally more complex and specialized: photosynthesis was most efficient at the top; roots were required in order to extract water from the ground; the parts in between became supports and transport systems for water and nutrients.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLifeEd3P120To122" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KenrickCrane1997EvolutionOfLandPlants" /&gt;

Spores of land plants, possibly rather like [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], have been found in Middle Ordovician rocks dated to about {{ma|476|Ma|Ordovician}}. In [[Wenlock (Silurian)|Middle Silurian]] rocks {{ma|430|Ma|Silurian}}, there are fossils of actual plants including [[Lycopodiopsida|clubmoss]]es such as ''[[Baragwanathia]]''; most were under {{convert|10|cm|in}} high, and some appear closely related to [[vascular plant]]s, the group that includes [[tree]]s.&lt;ref name="KenrickCrane1997EvolutionOfLandPlants"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kenrick |first1=Paul |last2=Crane |first2=Peter R. |authorlink2=Peter Crane |date=September 4, 1997 |title=The origin and early evolution of plants on land |url=http://biology.kenyon.edu/courses/biol112/Biol112WebPage/Syllabus/Topics/Week%207/land%20plants.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Nature |volume=389 |issue=6646 |pages=33–39 |bibcode=1997Natur.389...33K |doi=10.1038/37918 |accessdate=2015-02-10 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Late Devonian {{ma|370|Ma|Devonian}}, trees such as ''[[Archaeopteris]]'' were so abundant that they changed river systems from mostly [[braided river|braided]] to mostly [[meander]]ing, because their roots bound the soil firmly.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Briggs and Crowther 2001|Scheckler 2001]], "Afforestation—the First Forests," pp. 67–70&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, they caused the "Late Devonian wood crisis"&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "Late Devonian wood crisis" is used at {{cite web |url=http://palaeos.com/vertebrates/tetrapoda/acanthostega.html |title=Tetrapoda: ''Acanthostega'' |website=[[Palaeos]] |accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; because:
* They removed more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing the [[greenhouse effect]] and thus causing an [[ice age]] in the [[Carboniferous]] period.&lt;ref name="AlgeoScheckler1998errestrialMarineTeleconnectionsInDevonian"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Algeo |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Scheckler |first2=Stephen E. |date=January 29, 1998 |title=Terrestrial-marine teleconnections in the Devonian: links between the evolution of land plants, weathering processes, and marine anoxic events |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=353 |issue=1365 |pages=113–130 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0195 |pmc=1692181 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later ecosystems the carbon dioxide "locked up" in wood is returned to the atmosphere by decomposition of dead wood.

* The increasing depth of plants' roots led to more washing of nutrients into rivers and seas by rain. This caused [[algal bloom]]s whose high consumption of oxygen caused [[anoxic event]]s in deeper waters, increasing the extinction rate among deep-water animals.&lt;ref name="AlgeoScheckler1998errestrialMarineTeleconnectionsInDevonian" /&gt;

=== Land invertebrates ===
Animals had to change their feeding and [[Excretion|excretory]] systems, and most land animals developed [[internal fertilization]] of their eggs.&lt;ref name="Garwood" /&gt; The difference in [[refractive index]] between water and air required changes in their eyes. On the other hand, in some ways movement and breathing became easier, and the better transmission of high-frequency sounds in air encouraged the development of [[hearing]].&lt;ref name="Selden2001TerrestrializationOfAnimals" /&gt;

The [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] of other major invertebrate groups on land is poor: none at all for non-[[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[flatworm]]s, [[nematode]]s or [[nemertea]]ns; some parasitic nematodes have been fossilized in [[amber]]; annelid worm fossils are known from the Carboniferous, but they may still have been aquatic animals; the earliest fossils of [[Gastropoda|gastropod]]s on land date from the Late Carboniferous, and this group may have had to wait until [[Plant litter|leaf litter]] became abundant enough to provide the moist conditions they need.&lt;ref name="Selden2001TerrestrializationOfAnimals"&gt;[[#Briggs and Crowther 2001|Selden 2001]], "Terrestrialization of Animals," pp. 71–74&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest confirmed fossils of flying [[insect]]s date from the Late Carboniferous, but it is thought that insects developed the ability to fly in the Early Carboniferous or even Late Devonian. This gave them a wider range of [[ecological niche]]s for feeding and breeding, and a means of escape from predators and from unfavorable changes in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimaldi|Engel|2005|pp=155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 99% of modern insect species fly or are descendants of flying species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimaldi|Engel|2005|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Family tree of [[tetrapod]]s&lt;ref name="AhlbergMilner1994OriginOfTetrapods" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
[[Tetrapod]]s, vertebrates with four limbs, evolved from other [[rhipidistia]]n fish over a relatively short timespan during the Late Devonian ({{ma|370|360|Ma|Devonian}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Malcolm S. |last2=Graham |first2=Jeffrey B. |last3=Wang |first3=Tobias |date=September–October 2004 |title=Introduction to the Special Collection: Revisiting the Vertebrate Invasion of the Land |journal=[[Physiological and Biochemical Zoology]] |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=697–699 |doi=10.1086/425182 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early groups are grouped together as [[Labyrinthodontia]]. They retained aquatic, fry-like [[tadpole]]s, a system still seen in [[Lissamphibia|modern amphibians]]. 

Iodine and T4/T3  stimulate the amphibian metamorphosis and the [[evolution of nervous systems]] transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into  a “more evoluted” terrestrial, carnivorous frog with better neurological, visuospatial, olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine|journal=Current Chemical Biology-|volume=5 |pages=155–162|year=2011|doi=10.2174/187231311796765012|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new hormonal action of T3 was made possible by the formation of T3-receptors in the cells of vertebrates. Firstly, about 600-500 million years ago, in primitive Chordata appeared the alpha T3-receptors with a metamorphosing action and then, about 250-150 million years ago, in the Birds and Mammalia appeared the beta T3-receptors with metabolic and thermogenetic actions.&lt;ref name=Venturi&gt;{{cite book | last = Venturi | first = S |author2=Bégin ME | year = 2010 | chapter = Thyroid Hormone, Iodine and Human Brain Evolution | title= Environmental Influences on Human Brain Evolution | editors = Cunnane S; Stewart K | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=gfkRnv20GtsC&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 105–124] | isbn = 978-0-470-45268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s to the early 1980s it was thought that tetrapods evolved from fish that had already acquired the ability to crawl on land, possibly in order to go from a pool that was drying out to one that was deeper. However, in 1987, nearly complete fossils of ''[[Acanthostega]]'' from about {{ma|363|Ma|Devonian}} showed that this Late Devonian [[Transitional fossil|transitional]] animal had [[leg]]s and both [[lung]]s and [[gill]]s, but could never have survived on land: its limbs and its wrist and ankle joints were too weak to bear its weight; its ribs were too short to prevent its lungs from being squeezed flat by its weight; its fish-like tail fin would have been damaged by dragging on the ground. The current hypothesis is that ''Acanthostega'', which was about {{convert|1|m|ft}} long, was a wholly aquatic predator that hunted in shallow water&lt;!-- , using its limbs to hold on to vegetation while it lay in ambush --&gt;. Its skeleton differed from that of most fish, in ways that enabled it to raise its head to breathe air while its body remained submerged, including: its jaws show modifications that would have enabled it to gulp air; the bones at the back of its skull are locked together, providing strong attachment points for muscles that raised its head; the head is not joined to the [[shoulder girdle]] and it has a distinct neck.&lt;ref name="Clack2005GettingLegUp"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clack |first=Jennifer A. |authorlink=Jenny Clack |date=December 2005 |title=Getting a Leg Up on Land |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/getting-a-leg-up-on-land/ |journal=Scientific American |volume=293 |issue=6 |pages=100–107 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1205-100 |accessdate=2015-02-12 |ref=harv |pmid=16323697|bibcode=2005SciAm.293f.100C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Devonian proliferation of land plants may help to explain why air breathing would have been an advantage: leaves falling into streams and rivers would have encouraged the growth of aquatic vegetation; this would have attracted grazing invertebrates and small fish that preyed on them; they would have been attractive prey but the environment was unsuitable for the big marine predatory fish; air-breathing would have been necessary because these waters would have been short of oxygen, since warm water holds less [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] than cooler marine water and since the decomposition of vegetation would have used some of the oxygen.&lt;ref name="Clack2005GettingLegUp" /&gt;

Later discoveries revealed earlier transitional forms between ''Acanthostega'' and completely fish-like animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Daeschler |first1=Edward B. |authorlink1=Ted Daeschler |last2=Shubin |first2=Neil H. |authorlink2=Neil Shubin |last3=Jenkins |first3=Farish A., Jr. |authorlink3=Farish Jenkins |date=April 6, 2006 |title=A Devonian tetrapod-like fish and the evolution of the tetrapod body plan |url=http://courses.washington.edu/bio354/Paper%203.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Nature |volume=440 |pages=757–763 |issue=7085 |bibcode=2006Natur.440..757D |doi=10.1038/nature04639 |pmid=16598249 |accessdate=2015-02-12 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there is then a gap ([[Romer's gap]]) of about 30 Ma between the fossils of ancestral tetrapods and Middle Carboniferous fossils of vertebrates that look well-adapted for life on land. Some of these look like early relatives of modern amphibians, most of which need to keep their skins moist and to lay their eggs in water, while others are accepted as early relatives of the [[amniote]]s, whose waterproof skin and egg membranes enable them to live and breed far from water.&lt;ref name="AhlbergMilner1994OriginOfTetrapods"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ahlberg |first1=Per E. |authorlink1=Per E.

== Social insects ==

{{main|Eusociality}}
The social insects are remarkable because the great majority of individuals in each colony are sterile. This appears contrary to basic concepts of evolution such as natural selection and the [[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]. In fact, there are very few [[Eusociality|eusocial]] insect species: only 15 out of approximately 2,600 living [[family (biology)|families]] of insects contain eusocial species, and it seems that eusociality has evolved independently only 12 times among arthropods, although some eusocial lineages have diversified into several families. Nevertheless, social insects have been spectacularly successful; for example although [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s account for only about 2% of known insect species, they form over 50% of the total mass of insects. Their ability to control a territory appears to be the foundation of their success.&lt;ref name="WilsonHölldobler2005EusocialityOriginConsequences"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Edward O. |authorlink1=E. O.

The sacrifice of breeding opportunities by most individuals has long been explained as a consequence of these species' unusual [[Haplodiploidy|haplodiploid]] method of [[sex-determination system|sex determination]], which has the paradoxical consequence that two sterile worker daughters of the same queen share more genes with each other than they would with their offspring if they could breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=William O.

O. Wilson]] and [[Bert Hölldobler]] argue that this explanation is faulty: for example, it is based on [[kin selection]], but there is no evidence of [[nepotism]] in colonies that have multiple queens. Instead, they write, eusociality evolves only in species that are under strong pressure from predators and competitors, but in environments where it is possible to build "fortresses"; after colonies have established this security, they gain other advantages through co-operative [[foraging]]. In support of this explanation they cite the appearance of eusociality in [[Blesmol|bathyergid]] mole rats,&lt;ref name="WilsonHölldobler2005EusocialityOriginConsequences" /&gt; which are not haplodiploid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lovegrove |first=Barry G. |date=January 1991 |title=The evolution of eusociality in molerats (Bathyergidae): a question of risks, numbers, and costs |journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=37–45 |doi=10.1007/BF00172137 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest fossils of insects have been found in Early Devonian rocks from about {{ma|400|Ma|Devonian}}, which preserve only a few varieties of flightless insect. The [[Mazon Creek fossil beds|Mazon Creek lagerstätten]] from the Late Carboniferous, about {{ma|300|Ma|Carboniferous}}, include about 200 species, some gigantic by modern standards, and indicate that insects had occupied their main modern ecological niches as [[herbivore]]s, [[detritivore]]s and insectivores. Social termites and ants first appear in the Early Cretaceous, and advanced social bees have been found in Late Cretaceous rocks but did not become abundant until the Middle [[Cenozoic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Labandeira|Eble|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that, along with other life forms, modern-day humans evolved from an ancient, common ancestor was proposed by [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]] in 1844 and taken up by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin200.christs.cam.ac.uk/pages/index.php?page_id=c8 |title=Darwin &amp; the Descent of Man |last=Montgomery |first=Stephen |year=2009 |website=Charles Darwin &amp; Evolution |publisher=[[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]] |location=Cambridge |accessdate=2015-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225222347/http://darwin200.christs.cam.ac.uk/pages/index.php?page_id=c8 |archivedate=2015-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern humans evolved from a lineage of upright-walking [[ape]]s that has been traced back over {{ma|6|Ma}} to ''[[Sahelanthropus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brunet |first1=Michel |authorlink1=Michel Brunet (paleontologist) |last2=Guy |first2=Franck |last3=Pilbeam |first3=David |authorlink3=David Pilbeam |last4=Mackaye |first4=Hassane Taisso |last5=Likius |first5=Andossa |last6=Ahounta |first6=Djimdoumalbaye |last7=Beauvilain |first7=Alain |last8=Blondel |first8=Cécile |date=July 11, 2002 |title=A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, Central Africa |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6894/abs/nature00879.html |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6894 |pages=145–151 |doi=10.1038/nature00879 |pmid=12110880 |accessdate=2008-09-09 |display-authors=3 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known [[stone tool]]s were made about {{ma|2.5|Ma}}, apparently by ''[[Australopithecus garhi]]'', and were found near animal bones that bear scratches made by these tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Heinzelin |first1=Jean |authorlink1=Jean de Heinzelin de Braucourt |last2=Clark |first2=J.

== Mass extinctions ==
{{main|Extinction event}}
{{annotated image/Extinction|caption=Apparent extinction intensity, i.e. the fraction of [[Genus|genera]] going extinct at any given time, as reconstructed from the [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]]. (Graph not meant to include the recent, ongoing [[Holocene extinction]] event).}}
Life on Earth has suffered occasional mass extinctions at least since {{ma|542|Ma}}. Although they were disasters at the time, mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of life on Earth. When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the new dominant group is "superior" to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one.&lt;ref name="Van Valkenburgh 1999 463–493" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benton|2005a|loc=Chapter 6: "Tetrapods of the Triassic"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Phanerozoic biodiversity | float=right}}
The fossil record appears to show that the gaps between mass extinctions are becoming longer and the average and background rates of extinction are decreasing. Both of these phenomena could be explained in one or more ways:&lt;ref name="MacLeod2001Extinction"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstscience.com/SITE/ARTICLES/macleod.asp |title=Extinction! |last=MacLeod |first=Norman |date=January 6, 2001 |website=FirstScience.com |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The oceans may have become more hospitable to life over the last 500&amp;nbsp;Ma and less vulnerable to mass extinctions: dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of [[eutrophication]] and anoxic events; and marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains were less likely to be disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Ronald E. |date=June 1995 |title=Cyclic and secular variation in microfossil biomineralization: clues to the biogeochemical evolution of Phanerozoic oceans |journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]] |volume=11 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.1016/0921-8181(94)00011-2 |bibcode=1995GPC....11....1M |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Ronald E. |date=June 1996 |title=Secular Increase in Nutrient Levels through the Phanerozoic: Implications for Productivity, Biomass, and Diversity of the Marine Biosphere |journal=PALAIOS |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=209–219 |doi=10.2307/3515230 |jstor=3515230 |ref=harv|bibcode=1996Palai..11..209M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reasonably complete fossils are very rare, most extinct organisms are represented only by partial fossils, and complete fossils are rarest in the oldest rocks. So paleontologists have mistakenly assigned parts of the same organism to different genera, which were often defined solely to accommodate these finds—the story of ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' is an example of this. The risk of this mistake is higher for older fossils because these are often both unlike parts of any living organism and poorly conserved. Many of the "superfluous" genera are represented by fragments which are not found again and the "superfluous" genera appear to become extinct very quickly.&lt;ref name="MacLeod2001Extinction" /&gt;

[[Biodiversity]] in the fossil record, which is "...the number of distinct genera alive at any given time; that is, those whose first occurrence predates and whose last occurrence postdates that time"&lt;ref name="RohdeMuller2005" /&gt; shows a different trend: a fairly swift rise from {{ma|542|400|Ma}}; a slight decline from {{ma|400|200|Ma}}, in which the devastating Permian–Triassic extinction event is an important factor; and a swift rise from {{ma|200|Ma}} to the present.&lt;ref name="RohdeMuller2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rohde |first1=Robert A. |authorlink1=Robert Rohde |last2=Muller |first2=Richard A. |authorlink2=Richard A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18701">{{Anthropology of kinship |concepts}}

'''Fictive kinship''' is a term used by [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographers]] to describe forms of [[kinship]] or social ties that are based on neither [[consanguinity|consanguineal]] (blood ties) nor [[Affinity (law)|affinal]] ("by marriage") ties, in contrast to ''true kinship'' ties.

To the extent that consanguineal and affinal kinship ties might be considered ''real'' or ''true'' kinship, the term ''fictive kinship'' has in the past been used to refer to those kinship ties that are ''fictive'', in the sense of ''not-real''. Invoking the concept as a cross-culturally valid anthropological category therefore rests on the presumption that the inverse category of "(true) kinship" built around consanguinity and affinity is similarly cross-culturally valid. Use of the term was common until the mid-to-late twentieth century, when anthropology effectively deconstructed and revised many of the concepts and categories around the study of kinship and social ties. In particular, anthropologists established that a consanguinity basis for kinship ties is not universal across cultures, and that—on the contrary—it may be a culturally specific symbol of kinship only in particular cultures (see the articles on [[kinship]] and [[David M. Schneider]] for more information on the history of kinship studies).

Stemming from anthropology's early connections to legal studies, the term ''fictive kinship'' may also be used in a legal sense, and this use continues in societies where these categories and definitions regarding kinship and social ties have legal currency; e.g. in matters of inheritance.

As part of the deconstruction of kinship mentioned above, anthropologists now recognize that—cross-culturally—the kinds of social ties and relationships formerly treated under the category of "kinship" are very often not necessarily predicated on blood ties or marriage ties, and may rather be based on shared residence, shared economic ties, [[nurture kinship]], or familiarity via other forms of interaction.

In [[sociology of the family]], this idea is referred to as '''chosen kin''', '''fictive kin''' or '''voluntary kin'''. Sociologists define the concept as a form of extended family members who are not related by either blood or marriage. The bonds allowing for chosen kinship may include religious rituals, close friendship ties,&lt;ref name=Ebaugh&gt;Ebaugh, Helen Rose, and Mary Curry. "Fictive kin as social capital in new immigrant communities." ''Sociological Perspectives 43'', no. 2 (2000): 189-209.&lt;/ref&gt; or other essential reciprocal social or economic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Fordham, Signithia. "Racelessness as a factor in Black students' school success: Pragmatic strategy or pyrrhic victory?." ''Harvard educational review 58'', no. 1 (1988): 54-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of chosen kin include [[godparents]], informally adopted children, and close family friends.&lt;ref name=Ciabattari&gt;Ciabattari, Teresa. ''Sociology of Families: Change, Continuity, and Diversity''. SAGE Publications. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31–32}} The idea of fictive kin has been used to analyze aging,&lt;ref&gt;Mac Rae, Hazel. "Fictive kin as a component of the social networks of older people." ''Research on Aging 14'', no. 2 (1992): 226-247.&lt;/ref&gt; foreign fighters, &lt;ref&gt;Cerwyn Moore (2015) Foreign Bodies: Transnational Activism, the Insurgency in the North Caucasus and “Beyond”, Terrorism and Political Violence, vol.27, no.3, 395-415&lt;/ref&gt; immigrant communities,&lt;ref name=Ebaugh/&gt; and minorities&lt;ref&gt;Liebow, Elliot. ''Tally's corner: A study of Negro streetcorner men''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stack, Carol B. All our kin. Basic Books, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; in modern societies. Some researchers state that peers have the potential to create fictive kin networks.&lt;ref&gt;Tierney, William G., and Kristan M. Venegas. "Fictive kin and social capital the role of peer groups in applying and paying for college." ''American Behavioral Scientist 49'', no. 12 (2006): 1687-1702.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Types of relations often described by anthropologists as ''fictive kinship'' include [[compadrazgo]] relations, [[foster care]], common membership in a unilineal descent group, and legal [[adoption]]. A noted [[Gurung]] tradition is the institution of "Rodi", where teenagers form fictive kinship bonds and become Rodi members to socialize, perform communal tasks, and find marriage partners. In [[Western culture]], a person may refer to close friends of one's parents as "aunt" or "uncle" (and their children as "cousin"), or may refer to close friends as "brother" or "sister", although this is just a mere courtesy treatment and does not represent an actual valuation as such. In particular, college fraternities and sororities in some North American cultures usually use "brother" and "sister" to refer to members of the organization. Monastic, Masonic, and Lodge organisations also use the term "Brother" for members. "Nursing Sister" is used to denote a rank of nurse, and the term "Sisterhood" may be used for feminists. Fictive kinship was discussed by Jenny White in her work on female migrant workers in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;White, ''Money Makes Us Relatives''.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, she draws on ideas of production and the women she works with being drawn together through "webs of indebtedness" through which the women refer to each other as kin. These relationships are, however, less frequent than kin relationships, and serve purposes that are not comparable to, nor exclude, a natural [[family]] and, much less, natural and universal parents-having-children reproduction system.

* Compadrazgo is a form of fictive kinship that is rooted in Central Mexico history for many years. Literally meaning "co-parenthood", compadrazgo is a term to describe the set of relationships between a child, their parents, and their godparents. It has been hypothesized that these relationships evolved after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest in 1521]] to help deal with stressful situations.&lt;ref&gt;Horstman, Compadrazgo and Adaptation in Sixteenth Century Central Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; These fictive kinships still exist in modern day Mexican societies, and are established by providing some form of aid throughout the child's life.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos, Fictive Kinship and Modernization in Mexico: A Comparative Analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; Godparents seldom become more important than parents, though, much less in a non-economic fashion.
* Undocumented immigrants have also demonstrated fictive kin relationships. Undocumented restaurant workers are known to form pseudo-families in which they cooperate within living and working situations.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, "Mama's Family": Fictive Kinship and undocumented immigrant restaurant workers.&lt;/ref&gt; These relationships benefit the workers by creating a support system that would otherwise be unavailable to those living far from home. These ties are, however, fictive in a strict sense and mean nothing to the people in such pretenses.
* Some fictive kin relationships have been discovered in [[Israel]] in relation to [[Organ transplantation|organ transplants]]. Hospital committees are formed to assess whether the organ donation is from a true family member or from a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, Unknotting fictive kinship and legal process.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to obtain organ transplants, some individuals are forced to find strangers and pay them compensation for the procedure. However, the relationship between the donor and recipient must be invented as a familial relationship in order to pass through the hospital committee. In this case, fictive kinship is created knowingly to both parties in order to achieve their goals, and is mutualistic in nature.
* Adoption and foster care have always been grouped into the fictive kinship category (in cases where the child shares no genetic relatedness to the caregivers). The children are normally treated as the adopters' biological kin, receiving a lot of parental investment despite not having family ties. This view has been chastised by some who claim that notions of kinship are not always based on biological determinants.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Adoption of the Unrelated Child: Some Challenges to the Anthropological Study of Kinship&lt;/ref&gt; But these links do not mean that the adopters would not love more their biological offspring, given the extra natural motivation of survival.
* The [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] has also been an avenue to propagate fictive kinship, such as the sense of brotherhood felt by the soldiers. Fictive kinship has been demonstrated among the spouses of military men and women as well.&lt;ref&gt;Frese, Anthropology and the United States military: Coming of Age in the Twenty First Century.&lt;/ref&gt; These relationships may facilitate close bonds that are beneficial during times of hardship.
* Other times, relationships can appear from the outside to be fictive kinship relationships, but the reality is that this appearance is just the result of kinship terminology. Members of the Shanti Nagar village in [[North India]] refer to everyone—even strangers—in familial terms.&lt;ref&gt;Freed, Fictive Kinship in a North Indian Village&lt;/ref&gt; A man would address another man of a similar in age as "brother", and would address an older man as "uncle". Although these terms used in addressing one another appear to be indicative of fictive kinship, they do not actually suggest the existence of ritual kin relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Vatuk, Reference, Address, and Fictive Kinship in Urban North India.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques ==
Recently, many anthropologists have abandoned a distinction between "real" and "fictive" kin, because many cultures do not base their notion of kinship on genealogical relations. This was argued most forcefully by [[David M. Schneider]], in his 1984 book ''A critique of the study of kinship''.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, ''A Critique of The Study of Kinship''&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this insight, [[Janet Carsten]] developed the idea of "[[relatedness]]". She developed her initial ideas from studies with the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] in looking at what was socialized and biological. Here she uses the idea of relatedness to move away from a pre-constructed analytics opposition which exists in anthropological thought between the biological and the social.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten, ''The substance of kinship and the heat of the hearth; feeding, personhood and relatedness among the Malays in Pulau Langkawi''.&lt;/ref&gt; Carsten argued that relatedness should be described in terms of indigenous statements and practices, some of which fall outside what anthropologists have conventionally understood as kinship.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten, ''Cultures of Relatedness''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not imply, however, that human non-kin relationships, such as in [[tit-for-tat]] situations, even within a friendship relation, are more important than kin relationships, since their motivation is also related to one's survival and perpetuation, or that people are necessarily bound to the culture they are inserted in, nor can it be generalized to the point of claiming all individuals always undervalue kinship in the absence of nurturing. [[Herbert Gintis]], in his review of the book ''[[Sex at Dawn]]'', critiques the idea that human males were unconcerned with parentage, "which would make us unlike any other species I can think of".&lt;ref name=gintis&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gintis|first1=Herbert|title=Much that is True, but Remember: Is does not Imply Ought,|url=http://smile.amazon.com/review/RKVMPRH1FYL2T/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0061707805&amp;nodeID=283155&amp;store=books#wasThisHelpful|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals can be considered out of the natural tendency of living beings for survival through offspring.

In response to a similar model advanced by [[E. O. Wilson]], [[Rice University]]’s [[David Queller]] said that such new model "involves, and I suspect requires, close kinship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Brandon Keim|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/08/kin-selection-challenged/2/|title=E.O. Wilson proposes new theory of social evolution|date=2010-08-26|website=Wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory also overlooks phenomena of survivalist non-kin or not close kin such as the one that can be seen on [[tribalism]] or [[ethnic nationalism]].

== Use in sociobiology ==
{{see also| Social bonding and nurture kinship}}

In the biological and animal behavioural sciences, the term "kinship" has a different meaning from the current anthropological usage of the term, and more in common with the former anthropological usage that assumed that blood ties are ontologically prior to social ties. In these sciences, "kinship" is commonly used as a shorthand for "the regression coefficient of (genetic) relatedness", which is a metric denoting the proportion of shared genetic material between any two individuals relative to average degrees of genetic variance in the population under study. This coefficient of relationship is an important component of the theory of [[inclusive fitness]], a treatment of the evolutionary selective pressures on the emergence of certain forms of social behavior. Confusingly, inclusive fitness theory is more popularly known through its narrower form, [[kin selection]] theory, whose name clearly resonates with former conceptions of "kinship" in anthropology.

Whilst inclusive fitness theory thus describes one of the necessary conditions for the evolutionary emergence of social behaviors, the details of the proximate conditions mediating the expression of social bonding and cooperation have been less investigated in sociobiology. In particular, the question of whether genetic relatedness (or "blood ties") must necessarily be present for social bonding and cooperation to be expressed has been the source of much confusion, partly due to thought experiments in [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s early theoretical treatments. In addition to setting out the details of the evolutionary selection pressure, Hamilton roughly outlined two possible mechanisms by which the expression of social behaviors might be mediated:

{{quote
 | The  selective  advantage  which  makes  behaviour  conditional  in  the  right  sense  on the  discrimination  of  factors  which  correlate  with  the  relationship  of  the  individual concerned  is  therefore  obvious.  It  may  be,  for  instance,  that  in  respect  of  a  certain social  action  performed  towards  neighbours  indiscriminately,  an  individual  is  only just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness. If he could learn to recognise those of his neighbours  who  really  were  close  relatives  and  could  devote  his  beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to inclusive fitness would at once appear. Thus a mutation causing such discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive  fitness and would be selected. In fact, the individual may not need to perform any discrimination so sophisticated as we suggest here; a difference in the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations evoking it were encountered near to, or far from, his own home might occasion an advantage of a similar kind.&lt;ref name="H1964" /&gt;
}}

Traditional sociobiology did not consider the divergent consequences between these basic possibilities for the expression of social behavior, and instead assumed that the expression operates in the "recognition" manner, whereby individuals are behaviorally primed to discriminate which others are their true genetic relatives, and engage in cooperative behavior with them. But when expression has evolved to be primarily location-based or context-based—depending on a society's particular demographics and history—social ties and cooperation may or may not coincide with blood ties. Reviews&lt;ref name="SBNK"/&gt; of the mammal, primate, and human evidence demonstrate that expression of social behaviors in these species are primarily location-based and context-based (see [[nurture kinship]]), and examples of what used to be labeled as "fictive kinship" are readily understood in this perspective. Social cooperation, however, does not mean people see each other as family or family-like, nor that people will value those known not to be related with them more than the ones who are or simply neglect relatedness.

{{ForensicScience|disciplines|image=Dent cassee sur une roue spiro-conique.jpg}}
'''Forensic engineering''' has been defined as ''"the investigation of failures - ranging from serviceability to catastrophic - which may lead to legal activity, including both civil and criminal".''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic Engineering - a professional approach to investigation|last=Neale (Ed)|first=B S|publisher=Thomas Telford|year=1999|isbn=|location=London|pages=i}}&lt;/ref&gt;    It  therefore includes  the investigation of [[material science|materials]], [[product (business)|products]], [[structure]]s or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing [[personal injury]], damage to property or economic loss. The consequences of failure may give rise to action under either criminal or civil law including but not limited to  health and safety legislation, the laws of contract and/or [[product liability]] and the laws of [[Tort|tort.]]  The field also deals with retracing processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or machinery.  Generally, the purpose of a [[Forensics|forensic]] [[engineering]] investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view to improve performance or life of a component, or to assist a court in determining the facts of an [[accident]]. It can also involve investigation of [[intellectual property]] claims, especially [[patent]]s.

==History==
As the field of engineering has evolved over time, so has the field of forensic engineering. Early examples include investigation of [[bridge failure]]s such as the [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay rail bridge disaster]] of 1879 and the [[Dee bridge disaster]] of 1847. Many early rail accidents prompted the invention of [[tensile test]]ing of samples and [[fractography]] of failed components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History Of Metallography: The Development Of Ideas On The Structure Of Metals Before 1890 |last=Smith |first=Cyril Stanley|authorlink=Cyril Stanley Smith|origyear=1960|publisher=MIT Press |year=1988|isbn=9780262691208|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Vital to the field of forensic engineering is the process of investigating and collecting data related to the materials, products, structures or components that failed. This involves inspections, collecting evidence, measurements, developing models, obtaining exemplar products, and performing experiments. Often testing and measurements are conducted in an [[Independent testing laboratory]] or other reputable unbiased laboratory.

==Analysis==
[[Failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA) and [[fault tree analysis]] methods also examine product or process failure in a structured and systematic way, in the general context of [[safety engineering]]. However, all such techniques rely on accurate reporting of [[failure rate]]s, and precise identification, of the failure modes involved.

There is some common ground between forensic science and forensic engineering, such as scene of crime and scene of accident analysis, integrity of the evidence and court appearances. Both disciplines make extensive use of optical and [[scanning electron microscope]]s, for example. They also share common use of [[spectroscopy]] ([[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]], and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]]) to examine critical evidence. [[Radiography]] using [[X-ray]]s (such as [[X-ray computed tomography]]), or [[neutron]]s is also very useful in examining thick products for their internal defects before destructive examination is attempted. Often, however, a simple [[Magnifying glass|hand lens]] may reveal the cause of a particular problem.

[[Trace evidence]] is sometimes an important factor in reconstructing the sequence of events in an accident. For example, tire burn marks on a road surface can enable vehicle speeds to be estimated, when the brakes were applied and so on. Ladder feet often leave a trace of movement of the ladder during a slipaway, and may show how the accident occurred. When a product fails for no obvious reason, [[scanning electron microscope|SEM]] and [[Energy-dispersive X&amp;#8209;ray spectroscopy]] (EDX) performed in the microscope can reveal the presence of aggressive chemicals that have left traces on the fracture or adjacent surfaces. Thus an [[polyoxymethylene plastic|acetal resin]] water pipe joint suddenly failed and caused substantial damages to a building in which it was situated. Analysis of the joint showed traces of chlorine, indicating a [[stress corrosion cracking]] failure mode. The failed fuel pipe junction mentioned above showed traces of [[sulfur]] on the fracture surface from the [[sulfuric acid]], which had initiated the crack.

Extracting physical evidence from digital photography is a major technique used in forensic accident reconstruction. [[Match moving|Camera matching]], [[photogrammetry]], and [[Image rectification|photo rectification]] techniques are used to create three-dimensional and top-down views from the two-dimensional photos typically taken at an accident scene. Overlooked or undocumented evidence for accident reconstruction can be retrieved and quantified as long as photographs of such evidence are available. By using photographs of the accident scene including the vehicle, "lost" evidence can be recovered and accurately determined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veritecheng.com/white-paper-forensic-accident-reconstruction/ Extracting Physical Evidence from Digital Photographs for use in Forensic Accident Reconstruction], David Danaher, P.E., Jeff Ball, Ph.D., P.E., and Mark Kittel, P.E, 6-15-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forensic materials engineering]] involves methods applied to specific materials, such as [[metal]]s, [[glass]]es, [[ceramic]]s, [[composite material|composites]] and [[polymer]]s.

==Examples==
[[image:Plate7new.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Failed fuel pipe at right from a road traffic accident.]]
[[image:Plate4new.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Close-up of the broken fuel pipe from a road traffic accident.]]
[[Image:Broken fuel pipe.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Close-up of the broken fuel pipe.]]
The broken fuel pipe shown at left caused a serious accident when [[diesel fuel]] poured out from a van onto the road. A following car skidded and the driver was seriously injured when she collided with an oncoming [[lorry]]. [[Scanning electron microscopy]] or SEM showed that the [[nylon]] connector had fractured by [[stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) due to a small leak of [[battery acid]]. Nylon is susceptible to [[hydrolysis]] when in contact with [[sulfuric acid]], and only a small leak of acid would have sufficed to start a brittle crack in the [[injection moulded]] [[nylon&amp;nbsp;6,6]] connector by  SCC. The crack took about 7 days to grow across the diameter of the tube. The fracture surface showed a mainly brittle surface with striations indicating progressive growth of the crack across the diameter of the pipe. Once the crack had penetrated the inner bore, fuel started leaking onto the road.

The nylon&amp;nbsp;6,6 had been attacked by the following reaction, which was catalyzed by the acid:
:[[image:amide hydrolysis.svg]]

[[Diesel fuel]] is especially hazardous on road surfaces because it forms a thin, oily film that cannot be easily seen by drivers. It is much like [[black ice]] in its slipperiness, so skids are common when diesel leaks occur. The insurers of the van driver admitted liability and the injured driver was compensated.

==Applications==
Most manufacturing models will have a forensic component that monitors early failures to improve quality or efficiencies. Insurance companies use forensic engineers to prove liability or nonliability. Most engineering disasters ([[structural failure]]s such as bridge and building collapses) are subject to forensic investigation by engineers experienced in forensic methods of investigation. [[Rail crashes]], [[aviation accidents and incidents|aviation accidents]], and some [[car accident|automobile accidents]] are investigated by forensic engineers in particular where component failure is suspected. Furthermore, appliances, consumer products, medical devices, structures, industrial machinery, and even simple hand tools such as hammers or chisels can warrant investigations upon incidents causing injury or property damages. The failure of [[medical device]]s is often [[life-critical system|safety-critical]] to the user, so reporting failures and analysing them is particularly important. The environment of the body is complex, and [[implant (medicine)|implants]] must both survive this environment, and not leach potentially toxic impurities. Problems have been reported with [[breast implant]]s, [[heart valve]]s, and [[catheter]]s, for example.

Failures that occur early in the life of a new product are vital information for the manufacturer to improve the product. [[New product development]] aims to eliminate defects by testing in the factory before launch, but some may occur during its early life. Testing products to simulate their behavior in the external environment is a difficult skill, and may involve [[accelerated life testing]] for example. The worst kind of defect to occur after launch is a [[life-critical system|safety-critical]] defect, a defect that can endanger life or limb. Their discovery usually leads to a [[product recall]] or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Product defects often follow the [[bathtub curve]], with high initial failures, a lower rate during regular life, followed by another rise due to wear-out. National standards, such as those of [[ASTM International|ASTM]] and the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institute]], and [[International standard|International Standard]]s can help the designer in increasing product integrity.

==Historic examples==
[[Image:Dee bridge disaster.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Dee bridge disaster]].]]
There are many examples of forensic methods used to investigate accidents and disasters, one of the earliest in the modern period being the fall of the [[Dee bridge]] at [[Chester]], [[England]]. It was built using [[cast iron]] [[girder]]s, each of which was made of three very large castings dovetailed together. Each girder was strengthened by [[wrought iron]] bars along the length. It was finished in September 1846, and opened for local traffic after approval by the first Railway Inspector, General Charles Pasley. However, on 24 May 1847, a local train to [[Ruabon]] fell through the bridge. The accident resulted in five deaths (three passengers, the train guard, and the locomotive fireman) and nine serious injuries. The bridge had been designed by [[Robert Stephenson]], and he was accused of negligence by a local [[inquest]].

Although strong in compression, cast iron was known to be brittle in tension or bending. On the day of the accident, the bridge deck was covered with track ballast to prevent the oak beams supporting the track from catching fire, imposing a heavy extra load on the girders supporting the bridge and probably exacerbating the accident. Stephenson took this precaution because of a recent fire on the Great Western Railway at Uxbridge, London, where Isambard Kingdom Brunel's bridge caught fire and collapsed.

One of the first major inquiries conducted by the newly formed [[Railway Inspectorate]] was conducted by Captain Simmons of the [[Royal Engineers]], and his report suggested that repeated flexing of the girder weakened it substantially. He examined the broken parts of the main girder, and confirmed that the girder had broken in two places, the first break occurring at the center. He tested the remaining girders by driving a locomotive across them, and found that they deflected by several inches under the moving load. He concluded that the design was flawed, and that the wrought iron trusses fixed to the girders did not reinforce the girders at all, which was a conclusion also reached by the jury at the inquest. Stephenson's design had depended on the wrought iron trusses to strengthen the final structures, but they were anchored on the cast iron girders themselves, and so deformed with any load on the bridge. Others (especially Stephenson) argued that the train had derailed and hit the girder, the [[impact force]] causing it to [[fracture]]. However, [[Witness|eyewitnesses]] maintained that the girder broke first and the fact that the [[locomotive]] remained on the track showed otherwise.

==Publications==
Product failures are not widely published in the [[academic literature]] or trade literature, partly because companies do not want to advertise their problems. However, it then denies others the opportunity to improve product design so as to prevent further accidents. However, a notable exception to the reluctance to publish is the journal ''Engineering Failure Analysis'', which publishes case studies of a wide range of different products, failing under different circumstances. There are also an increasing number of textbooks becoming available.

Another notable publication, dealing with failures of buildings, bridges, and other structures, is the ''Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/cfo/ Scitation.aip.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
which is published by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]], under the umbrella of its Technical Council on Forensic Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tcfe.asce.org// tcfe.asce.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Functional specialization''' suggests that different areas in the brain are specialized for different functions.&lt;ref name=flourens&gt;Flourens, M. J. P.

== Historical origins ==
{{See also|History of neuroscience}}
[[File:Phrenology-journal.jpg|thumb|1848 edition of American Phrenological Journal published by Fowlers &amp; Wells, New York City]]

[[Phrenology]], created by [[Franz Joseph Gall]] (1758–1828) and Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776–1832) and best known for the idea that one's personality could be determined by the variation of bumps on their skull, proposed that different regions in one's brain have different functions and may very well be associated with different behaviours.&lt;ref name=flourens /&gt;&lt;ref name=lashley /&gt; Gall and Spurzheim were the first to observe the crossing of pyramidal tracts, thus explaining why lesions in one hemisphere are manifested in the opposite side of the body. However, Gall and Spurzheim did not attempt to justify phrenology on anatomical grounds. It has been argued that phrenology was fundamentally a science of race. Gall considered the most compelling argument in favor of phrenology the differences in skull shape found in sub-Saharan Africans and the anecdotal evidence (due to scientific travelers and colonists) of their intellectual inferiority and emotional volatility. In Italy, [[Luigi Rolando]] carried out lesion experiments and performed electrical stimulation of the brain, including the [[primary motor cortex|Rolandic area]].

[[File:Phineas gage - 1868 skull diagram.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A|Phineas Gage's accident]]
[[Phineas Gage]] became one of the first ''lesion case studies'' in 1848 when an explosion drove a large iron rod completely through his head, destroying his left [[frontal lobe]]. He recovered with no apparent sensory, motor, or gross cognitive deficits, but with behaviour so altered that friends described him as "no longer being Gage," suggesting that the damaged areas are involved in "higher functions" such as personality.&lt;ref&gt;Blair., R. (2004) The roles of orbital frontal cortex in the modulation of antisocial behaviour Brain and Cognition 55 pp. 198–208&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gage's mental changes are usually grossly exaggerated in modern presentations.

Subsequent cases (such as [[Broca's area|Broca's patient Tan]]) gave further support to the doctrine of specialization.

== Major theories of the brain ==
Currently, there are two major theories of the brain's cognitive function. The first is the theory of modularity. Stemming from phrenology, this theory supports functional specialization, suggesting the brain has different modules that are domain specific in function. The second theory, distributive processing, proposes that the brain is more interactive and its regions are functionally interconnected rather than specialized. Each orientation  plays a role within certain aims and tend to complement each other (see below section `Collaboration´).

=== Modularity ===
The theory of modularity suggests that there are functionally specialized regions in the brain that are domain specific for different cognitive processes.&lt;ref name=caramazza&gt;Caramazza, A., Coltheart, M. Cognitive Neuropsychology twenty years on. Cognitive Neuropsychology. Psychology Press. 23(1), 3–12. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Fodor]] expanded the initial notion of phrenology by creating his Modularity of the Mind theory. The Modularity of the Mind theory indicates that distinct neurological regions called [[modules]] are defined by their functional roles in cognition. He also rooted many of his concepts on modularity back to philosophers like Descartes, who wrote about the mind being composed of "organs" or "psychological faculties". An example of Fodor's concept of modules is seen in cognitive processes such as vision, which have many separate mechanisms for colour, shape and spatial perception.&lt;ref name=fodor&gt;Fodor, J. A. (1983). The Modularity of the Mind. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (pg 2–47)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the fundamental beliefs of domain specificity and the theory of modularity suggests that it is a consequence of [[natural selection]] and is a feature of our cognitive architecture. Researchers Hirschfeld and Gelman propose that because the human mind has evolved by natural selection, it implies that enhanced functionality would develop if it produced an increase in "fit" behaviour. Research on this evolutionary perspective suggests that domain specificity is involved in the development of cognition because it allows one to pinpoint adaptive problems.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, L. A., Gelman, S. A. (1994) Mapping the Mind: Domain specificity in cognition and culture. Cambridge University Press pg 37–169&lt;/ref&gt;

An issue for the modular theory of cognitive neuroscience is that there are cortical anatomical differences from person to person. Although many studies of modularity are undertaken from very specific lesion case studies, the idea is to create a neurological function map that applies to people in general. To extrapolate from lesion studies and other case studies this requires adherence to the ''universality assumption'', that there is no difference, in a qualitative sense, between subjects who are intact neurologically. For example, two subjects would fundamentally be the same neurologically before their lesions, and after have distinctly different cognitive deficits. Subject 1 with a lesion in the "A" region of the brain may show impaired functioning in cognitive ability "X" but not "Y", while subject 2 with a lesion in area "B" demonstrates reduced "Y" ability but "X" is unaffected; results like these allow inferences to be made about brain specialization and localization, also known as using a [[double dissociation]].&lt;ref name=caramazza /&gt;

The difficulty with this theory is that in typical non-lesioned subjects, locations within the brain anatomy are similar but not completely identical. There is a strong defense for this inherent deficit in our ability to generalize when using functional localizing techniques (fMRI, PET etc.). To account for this problem, the coordinate-based ''[[Talairach#Talairach_coordinates|Talairach]] and Tournoux stereotaxic system'' is widely used to compare subjects' results to a standard brain using an algorithm. Another solution using coordinates involves comparing brains using [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulcal]] reference points. A slightly newer technique is to use functional [[landmark point|landmarks]], which combines sulcal and gyral landmarks (the groves and folds of the cortex) and then finding an area well known for its modularity such as the [[fusiform face area]]. This landmark area then serves to orient the researcher to the neighboring cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Saxe, R., Brett, M., Kanwisher, N. Divide and conquer: A defense of functional localizers. Neuroimage. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Future developments for modular theories of neuropsychology may lie in "modular psychiatry". The concept is that a modular understanding of the brain and advanced neuro-imaging techniques will allow for a more empirical diagnosis of mental and emotional disorders. There has been some work done towards this extension of the modularity theory with regards to the physical neurological differences in subjects with depression and schizophrenia, for example. Zielasek and Gaeble have set out a list of requirements in the field of neuropsychology in order to move towards neuropsychiatry:

# To assemble a complete overview of putative modules of the human mind
# To establish module-specific diagnostic tests (specificity, sensitivity, reliability)
# To assess how far individual modules, sets of modules or their connections are affected in certain psychopathological situations
# To probe novel module-specific therapies like the facial affect recognition training or to retrain access to context information in the case of delusions and hallucinations, in which "hyper-modularity" may play a role &lt;ref&gt;Zielasek, J., Gaeble W. (2008) Modern modularity and the road towards modular psychiatry. Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci. 258, 60–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in the study of brain function can also be applied to [[cognitive behaviour therapy]]. As therapy becomes increasingly refined, it is important to differentiate cognitive processes in order to discover their relevance towards different patient treatments. An example comes specifically from studies on lateral specialization between the left and right cerebral hemispheres of the brain. The functional specialization of these hemispheres are offering insight on different forms of cognitive behaviour therapy methods, one focusing on verbal cognition (the main function of the left hemisphere) and the other emphasizing imagery or spatial cognition (the main function of the right hemisphere).&lt;ref name=tucker&gt;Tucker, D.M., Shearer, S.L., and Murray, J.D. (1977). Hemispheric Specialization and Cognitive Behavior Therapy. Cognitive Therapy and Research, VoL 1, pp. 263–273&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of therapies that involve imagery, requiring right hemisphere activity in the brain, include [[systematic desensitization]]&lt;ref&gt;Goldfried, M. R. Systematic desensitization as training in self-control. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 1971, 37, 228–234.&lt;/ref&gt; and anxiety management training.&lt;ref&gt;Suinn, R. M., &amp; Richardson, F. Anxiety management training: A nonspecific behavior therapy program for anxiety control. Behavior Therapy, 1971, 2, 498–510&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these therapy techniques rely on the patient's ability to use visual imagery to cope with or replace patients symptoms, such as anxiety. Examples of cognitive behaviour therapies that involve verbal cognition, requiring left hemisphere activity in the brain, include self-instructional training&lt;ref name=tucker /&gt; and stress inoculation.&lt;ref&gt;Novaco, R. W. (1977). Stress inoculation: A cognitive therapy for anger and its application to a case of depression. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology. Vol 45(4), 600–608.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these therapy techniques focus on patients' internal self-statements, requiring them to use vocal cognition. When deciding which cognitive therapy to employ, it is important to consider the primary cognitive style of the patient. Many individuals have a tendency to prefer visual imagery over verbalization and vice versa. One way of figuring out which hemisphere a patient favours is by observing their lateral eye movements. Studies suggest that eye gaze reflects the activation of cerebral hemisphere contralateral to the direction. Thus, when asking questions that require spatial thinking, individuals tend to move their eyes to the left, whereas when asked questions that require verbal thinking, individuals usually move their eyes to the right.&lt;ref&gt;Kocel, K., Galin, D., Ornstein, R., &amp; Merrin, E. L. Lateral eye movements and cognitive mode. Psychonomic Science, 1972, 27, 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt; In conclusion, this information allows one to choose the optimal cognitive behaviour therapeutic technique, thereby enhancing the treatment of many patients.

==== Areas representing modularity in the brain ====

=====Fusiform face area=====
One of the most well known examples of functional specialization is the [[fusiform face area]] (FFA). [[Justine Sergent]] was one of the first researchers that brought forth evidence towards the functional neuroanatomy of face processing. Using positron emission tomography (PET), Sergent found that there were different patterns of activation in response to the two different required tasks, face processing verses object processing.&lt;ref name=sergent&gt;Sergent, J., Signoret, J.L. (1992) Functional and anatomical decomposition of face processing: evidence from prosopagnosia and PET study of normal subject. The Royal Society. 335, 55–62&lt;/ref&gt; These results can be linked with her studies of brain-damaged patients with lesions in the occipital and temporal lobes. Patients revealed that there was an impairment of face processing but no difficulty recognizing everyday objects, a disorder also known as prosopagnosia.&lt;ref name=sergent /&gt; Later research by [[Nancy Kanwisher]] using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), found specifically that the region of the [[Anatomical terms of location#Superior_and_inferior|inferior]] temporal cortex, known as the [[fusiform gyrus]], was significantly more active when subjects viewed, recognized and categorized faces in comparison to other regions of the brain. Lesion studies also supported this finding where patients were able to recognize objects but unable to recognize faces. This provided evidence towards [[domain specificity]] in the visual system, as Kanwisher acknowledges the Fusiform Face Area as a module in the brain, specifically the [[extrastriate cortex]], that is specialized for face perception.&lt;ref&gt;Kanwisher, N., McDermott, J., Chun, M. (1997). The Fusiform Face Area: A Module in Human Extrastriate Cortex Specialized for Face Perception. The Journal of Neuroscience, 17(11):4302–4311&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Visual area V4 and V5=====
While looking at the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), using PET, researcher [[Semir Zeki]] directly demonstrated functional specialization within the visual cortex known as [[visual modularity]]. He localized regions involved specifically in the perception of colour and vision motion. For colour, [[visual area V4]] was located when subjects were shown two identical displays, one being multicoloured and the other shades of grey.&lt;ref&gt;Zeki, S., et al. (1991). A direct demonstration of functional specialization in human visual cortex. United Kingdom, London. Journal of Neuroscience, Vol 11, 641–649&lt;/ref&gt; This was further supported from lesion studies where individuals were unable to see colours after damage, a disorder known as [[achromatopsia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearlman AL, Birch J, Meadows JC (1979) Cerebral color blindness: an acquired defect in hue discrimination. Ann Neurol 5:253–261.&lt;/ref&gt; Combining PET and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), subjects viewing a moving checker board pattern verses a stationary checker board pattern located visual area V5, which is now considered to be specialized for vision motion. (Watson et al., 1993) This area of functional specialization was also supported by lesion study patients who's damage caused cerebral [[motion blindness]].&lt;ref&gt;Zihl J, von Cramon D, Mai N (1983) Selective disturbance of movement vision after bilateral brain damage. Brain 106:3 13–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Frontal lobes=====
Studies have found the [[frontal lobes]] to be involved in the [[executive functions]] of the brain, which are higher level cognitive processes.&lt;ref name=duncan&gt;Duncan, J., &amp; Owen, A. (2000). Common regions of the human frontal lobe recruited by diverse cognitive demands. Elsevier Science.&lt;/ref&gt; This control process is involved in the coordination, planning and organizing of actions towards an individual's goals. It contributes to such things as one's behaviour, language and reasoning. More specifically, it was found to be the function of the [[prefrontal cortex]],&lt;ref&gt;Fuster, J. (2008). The Prefrontal Cortex. Elsevier. (pg 178–353)&lt;/ref&gt; and evidence suggest that these executive functions control processes such as planning and decision making, error correction and assisting overcoming habitual responses. Miller and Cummings used PET and functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) to further support functional specialization of the frontal cortex. They found lateralization of verbal working memory in the left frontal cortex and visuospatial working memory in the right frontal cortex. Lesion studies support these findings where left frontal lobe patients exhibited problems in controlling executive functions such as creating strategies.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;Miller, B., Cummings, J. (2007) The Human Frontal Lobes: Functions and Disorders. The Guilford Press, New York and London.(pg 68–77)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dorsolateral]], [[ventrolateral]] and [[anterior cingulate]] regions within the prefrontal cortex are proposed to work together in different cognitive tasks, which is related to interaction theories. However, there has also been evidence suggesting strong individual specializations within this network.&lt;ref name=duncan /&gt; For instance, Miller and Cummings found that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is specifically involved in the manipulation and monitoring of sensorimotor information within working memory.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt;

=====Right and left hemispheres=====
During the 1960s, [[Roger Sperry]] conducted a natural experiment on epileptic patients who had previously had their corpora callosa cut. The corpus callosum is the area of the brain dedicated to linking both the right and left hemisphere together. Sperry et al.'s experiment was based on flashing images in the right and left visual fields of his participants. Because the participant's corpus callosum was cut, the information processed by each visual field could not be transmitted to the other hemisphere. In one experiment, Sperry flashed images in the right visual field (RVF), which would subsequently be transmitted to the left hemisphere (LH) of the brain. When asked to repeat what they had previously seen, participants were fully capable of remembering the image flashed. However, when the participants were then asked to draw what they had seen, they were unable to. When Sperry et al. flashed images in the left visual field (LVF), the information processed would be sent to the right hemisphere (RH) of the brain. When asked to repeat what they had previously seen, participants were unable to recall the image flashed, but were very successful in drawing the image. Therefore, Sperry concluded that the left hemisphere of the brain was dedicated to language as the participants could clearly speak the image flashed. On the other hand, Sperry concluded that the right hemisphere of the brain was involved in more creative activities such as drawing.&lt;ref&gt;"The Split Brain Experiments". Nobelprize.org. 4 Oct 2011 http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/split-brain/background.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Parahippocampal place area=====
Located in the [[parahippocampal gyrus]], the parahippocampal place area (PPA) was coined by Nancy Kanwisher and Russell Epstein after an fMRI study showed that the PPA responds optimally to scenes presented containing a spatial layout, minimally to single objects and not at all to faces.&lt;ref name=epstien&gt;Epstien, R., &amp; Kanwisher, N. (1998). A cortical representation of the local visual environment. Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Amherst Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also noted in this experiment that activity remains the same in the PPA when viewing a scene with an empty room or a room filled with meaningful objects. Kanwisher and Epstein proposed "that the PPA represents places by encoding the geometry of the local environment".&lt;ref name=epstien /&gt; In addition, Soojin Park and Marvin Chun posited that activation in the PPA is viewpoint specific, and so responds to changes in the angle of the scene. In contrast, another special mapping area, the [[retrosplenial cortex]] (RSC), is viewpoint invariant or does not change response levels when views change.&lt;ref&gt;Park, S., Chun, M. (2009) Different roles of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC)in panoramic scene perception. NeuroImage 47, 1747–1756.&lt;/ref&gt; This perhaps indicates a complementary arrangement of functionally and anatomically separate visual processing brain areas.

=====Extrastriate body area=====
Located in the lateral occipitotemporal cortex, fMRI studies have shown the extrastriate body area (EBA) to have selective responding when subjects see human bodies or body parts, implying that it has functional specialization. The EBA does not optimally respond to objects or parts of objects but to human bodies and body parts, a hand for example. In fMRI experiments conducted by Downing et al. participants were asked to look at a series of pictures. These stimuli includes objects, parts of objects (for example just the head of a hammer), figures of the human body in all sorts of positions and types of detail (including line drawings or stick men), and body parts (hands or feet) without any body attached. There was significantly more blood flow (and thus activation) to human bodies, no matter how detailed, and body parts than to objects or object parts.&lt;ref&gt;Downing, P., Jiang, Y., Shuman, M., Kanwisher, N. (2001) A cortical area selective for visual processing of the human body. Science, 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distributive processing ===
The cognitive theory of distributed processing suggests that brain areas are highly interconnected and process information in a distributed manner. 

A remarkable precedent of this orientation is the research of [[Justo Gonzalo]] on brain dynamics &lt;ref name=Dinamica&gt;[[Justo Gonzalo|Gonzalo, J.]] (1945, 1950, 1952, 2010).

From the gradation he observed between different syndromes in patients with different cortical lesions, this author proposed in 1952 a functional gradients model,&lt;ref name=Grdients&gt;[[Justo Gonzalo|Gonzalo, J.]] (1952). "Las funciones cerebrales humanas según nuevos datos y bases fisiológicas. Una introducción a los estudios de Dinámica Cerebral". [http://aleph.csic.es/F/4KEBKRYX27PBPSNBJBB5AFPQ8THHNR4941PP69A8C6CMG54DBX-15037?func=find-acc&amp;acc_sequence=000501143 ''Trabajos del Inst. Cajal de Investigaciones Biológicas''] '''XLIV''': pp.&amp;nbsp;95–157. [http://eprints.ucm.es/30931/ Complete English translation, Open Access].&lt;/ref&gt; which permits an ordering and an interpretation of multiple phenomena  and syndromes. The functional gradients are continuous functions through the cortex describing a distributed specificity, so that, for a given sensory system, the specific gradient, of contralateral character, is maximum in the corresponding projection area and decreases in gradation  towards more "central" zone and beyond so that the final decline reaches other primary areas.
As a consequence of the crossing and overlapping of the specific gradients, in the central zone where the overlap is greater, there would be an action of mutual integration, rather nonspecific (or  [[:en:Multisensory integration|multisensory]]) with bilateral character due to the [[corpus callosum]].  This action would be maximum in the central zone and minimal towards the projection areas. As the author stated (p. 20 of the English translation&lt;ref name=Grdients&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) "a functional continuity with regional variation is then offered, each point of the cortex acquiring different properties but with certain unity with the rest of the cortex. It is a dynamic conception of ''quantitative'' localizations".
A very similar gradients scheme was proposed by Elkhonon Goldberg in 1989 &lt;ref name=Goldberg&gt;Goldberg, E. (1989). "Gradiental approach to neocortical functional organization". ''J. Clinical and Experimental Neurophysiology'' '''11'''  489-517.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers who provide evidence to support the theory of distributive processing include Anthony McIntosh and William Uttal, who question and debate localization and modality specialization within the brain.
McIntosh's research suggests that human cognition involves interactions between the brain regions responsible for processes sensory information, such as vision, audition, and other mediating areas like the prefrontal cortex. McIntosh explains that modularity is mainly observed in sensory and motor systems, however, beyond these very receptors, modularity becomes "fuzzier" and you see the cross connections between systems increase.&lt;ref name=mcintosh&gt;McIntosh, A. R. (1999). Mapping Cognition to the Brain Through Neural Interactions. University of Toronto, Canada. Psychology Press, 523–548&lt;/ref&gt; He also illustrates that there is an overlapping of functional characteristics between the sensory and motor systems, where these regions are close to one another. These different neural interactions influence each other, where activity changes in one area influence other connected areas. With this, McIntosh suggest that if you only focus on activity in one area, you may miss the changes in other integrative areas.&lt;ref name=mcintosh /&gt; Neural interactions can be measured using [[analysis of covariance]] in [[neuroimaging]]. McIntosh used this analysis to convey a clear example of the interaction theory of distributive processing. In this study, subjects learned that an auditory stimulus signalled a visual event. McIntosh found activation (an increase blood flow), in an area of the [[occipital cortex]], a region of the brain involved in visual processing,&lt;ref&gt;Zeki, S. (1993). A vision of the brain. Cambridge, MA, US: Blackwell Scientific Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; when the auditory stimulus was presented alone. Correlations between the occipital cortex and different areas of the brain such as the [[prefrontal cortex]], [[premotor cortex]] and [[Anatomical terms of location#Superior and inferior|superior]] [[temporal cortex]] showed a pattern of co-variation and functional connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, A. R., Cabeza, R. E., and Lobaugh, N., J. (1998). Analysis of Neural Interactions Explains the Activation of Occipital Cortex by an Auditory Stimulus. The Journal of Neurophysiology Vol. 80 No. 5, pp. 2790–2796&lt;/ref&gt;

Uttal focusses on the limits of localizing cognitive processes in the brain. One of his main arguments is that since the late 90's, research in [[cognitive neuroscience]] has forgotten about conventional [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] studies based on behavioural observation. He believes that current research focusses on the technological advances of brain imaging techniques such as [[MRI]] and [[PET scans]]. Thus, he further suggest that this research is dependent on the assumptions of localization and hypothetical cognitive modules that use such imaging techniques to pursuit these assumptions. Uttal's major concern incorporates many controversies with the validly, over-assumptions and strong inferences some of these images are trying to illustrate. For instance, there is concern over the proper utilization of control images in an experiment. Most of the [[cerebrum]] is active during cognitive activity, therefore the amount of increased activity in a region must be greater when compared to a controlled area. In general, this may produce false or exaggerated findings and may increase potential tendency to ignore regions of diminished activity which may be crucial to the particular cognitive process being studied.&lt;ref name=uttal&gt;Uttal, W. R. (2002). Précis of The New Phrenology: The Limits of Localizing Cognitive Processes in the Brain. Department of Industrial Engineering, Arizona State University, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Uttal believes that localization researchers tend to ignore the complexity of the nervous system. Many regions in the brain are physically interconnected in a nonlinear system, hence, Uttal believes that behaviour is produced by a variety of system organizations.&lt;ref name=uttal /&gt;

===Collaboration===
The two theories, modularity and distributive processing, can also be combined. By operating simultaneously, these principles may interact with each other in a collaborative effort to characterize the functioning of the brain. Fodor himself, one of the major contributors to the modularity theory, appears to have this sentiment. He noted that modularity is a matter of degrees, and that the brain is modular to the extent that it warrants studying it in regards to its functional specialization.&lt;ref name=fodor /&gt; Although there are areas in the brain that are more specialized for cognitive processes than others, the nervous system also integrates and connects the information produced in these regions.  In fact, the proposed distributive scheme of the functional cortical  gradientes by [[Justo Gonzalo|J. Gonzalo]]&lt;ref name=Grdients/&gt; already tries to join both concepts modular and distributive: regional heterogeneity should be a definitive acquisition (maximum specificity in the projection paths and primary areas), but  the rigid separation between projection and association areas would be erased through the continuous functions of gradient.

The collaboration between the two theories not only would provide a more unified perception and understanding of the world but also make available the ability to learn from it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16943">'''GNSS enhancement''' refers to techniques used to improve the accuracy of positioning information provided by the [[Global Positioning System]] or other [[global navigation satellite systems]] in general, a network of satellites used for navigation.
{{duplication|dupe=Global Positioning Systems|date=February 2016}}
Enhancement methods of improving accuracy rely on external information being integrated into the calculation process. There are many such systems in place and they are generally named or described based on how the GPS sensor receives the information. Some systems transmit additional information about sources of error (such as clock drift, ephemeris, or [[ionospheric delay]]), others provide direct measurements of how much the signal was off in the past, while a third group provide additional navigational or vehicle information to be integrated in the calculation process.

Examples of augmentation systems include the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]], [[Differential GPS]], [[Inertial Navigation System]]s and [[Assisted GPS]].

== Background ==
The [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) is the American satellite-based system for positioning and navigation. Receivers on or near the Earth's surface can determine their locations based on signals received from any four or more of the satellites in the network.

All GPS satellites broadcast on the same two frequencies, known as L1 (1575.42&amp;nbsp;MHz) and L2 (1227.60&amp;nbsp;MHz). The network uses [[code-division multiple access]] (CDMA) to allow separate messages from the individual satellites to be distinguished. Two distinct CDMA encodings are used: the coarse/acquisition (C/A) code, which is accessible by the general public, and the precise (P) code, which is encrypted, so that only the U.S. military can access it. The messages sent from each satellite contain information ranging from the satellite health, the satellite's orbital path, the clock state of the satellite, and the configuration of the entire satellite network.

== Precise monitoring ==
The accuracy of a calculation can also be improved through precise monitoring and measuring of the existing GPS signals in additional or alternate ways.

After ''Selective Availability'' was turned off by the U.S. government, the largest error in GPS was usually the unpredictable delay through the ionosphere. The spacecraft broadcast ionospheric model parameters, but they are necessarily imperfect. This is one reason the GPS spacecraft transmit on at least two frequencies, L1 and L2. [[Error analysis for the Global Positioning System#Atmospheric effects|Ionospheric delay]] is a well-defined function of frequency and the [[total electron content]] (TEC) along the path, so measuring the arrival-time difference between the frequencies determines TEC and thus the precise ionospheric delay at each frequency.

Receivers with decryption keys can decode the P(Y)-code transmitted on both L1 and L2. However, these keys are reserved for the military and authorized agencies and are not available to the public. Without keys, it is still possible to use a ''codeless'' technique to compare the P(Y) codes on L1 and L2 to gain much of the same error information. However, this technique is slow, so it is currently limited to specialized surveying equipment. In the future, additional civilian codes are expected to be transmitted on the L2 and L5 frequencies (see [[GPS modernization]]). Then all users will be able to perform dual-frequency measurements and directly compute ionospheric-delay errors.

A second form of precise monitoring is called ''carrier-phase enhancement'' (CPGPS). &lt;ref name="ubiquitous" /&gt; The error, which this corrects, arises because the pulse transition of the [[Pseudorandom number generator|PRN]] is not instantaneous, and thus the [[cross-correlation|correlation]] (satellite–receiver sequence matching) operation is imperfect. The CPGPS approach utilizes the L1 carrier wave, which has a [[frequency|period]] of

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1~\text{s}}{1575.42 \times 10^6} = 0.63475~\text{ns} \approx 1~\text{ns}, &lt;/math&gt;

which is about one-thousandth of the C/A Gold code bit period of

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1~\text{s}}{1023 \times 10^3} = 977.5~\text{ns} \approx 1000~\text{ns}, &lt;/math&gt;

to act as an additional [[clock signal]] and resolve the uncertainty. The phase-difference error in the normal GPS amounts to between 2 and 3 meters (6 to 10&amp;nbsp;ft) of ambiguity. CPGPS working to within 1% of perfect transition reduces this error to 3 centimeters (1&amp;nbsp;inch) of ambiguity. By eliminating this source of error, CPGPS coupled with [[Differential GPS|DGPS]] normally realizes between 20 and 30 centimeters (8 to 12&amp;nbsp;inches) of absolute accuracy.

== Real-time kinematic positioning ==
{{main article|Real-time kinematic}}
''Real-time kinematic positioning'' (RKP) is another approach for a precise GPS-based positioning system. In this approach, determination of range signal can be resolved to a precision of less than 10 [[centimeters]] (4&amp;nbsp;in). This is done by resolving the number of cycles in which the signal is transmitted and received by the receiver. This can be accomplished by using a combination of differential GPS (DGPS) correction data, transmitting GPS signal phase information and ambiguity resolution techniques via statistical tests, possibly with processing in real-time.

== Timekeeping {{anchor|GPS time|GPS time and date}} ==
While most clocks are synchronized to [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), the [[atomic clock]]s on the satellites are set to ''GPS time''. The difference is that GPS time is not corrected to match the rotation of the Earth, so it does not contain [[leap second]]s or other corrections which are periodically added to UTC. GPS time was set to match [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) in 1980, but has since diverged. The lack of corrections means that GPS time remains at a constant offset with [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI) (TAI - GPS = 19 seconds). Periodic corrections are performed on the on-board clocks to correct relativistic effects and keep them synchronized with ground clocks.

The GPS navigation message includes the difference between GPS time and UTC, which as of 2016 is 17 seconds due to leap seconds added since 1980. Receivers subtract this offset from GPS time to calculate UTC and specific timezone values. The GPS-UTC offset, a signed eight-bit field,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gps.gov/technical/icwg/IS-GPS-200G.pdf Global Positioning Systems Directorate Systems Engineering &amp; Integration Interface Specification p. 114]&lt;/ref&gt; can accommodate up to 128 negative leaps or 127 positive leap seconds. At the current rate of Earth's rotation (with one positive leap second introduced approximately every 18 months), the offset field is sufficient for approximately one more century. However, as the Earth is not only rotating slower than when UTC was adopted in 1972, but also [[Coordinated Universal Time#Future|slowing down]] at a somewhat unpredictable rate, leap seconds will begin to occur more frequently. So, the GPS offset field may [[Integer overflow|overflow]] within the 21st century.

As opposed to the year, month, and day format of the [[Gregorian calendar]], the GPS date is expressed as a week number and a seconds-into-week number. The week number is transmitted as a ten-[[bit]] field in the C/A and P(Y) navigation messages, and so it becomes zero again every 1,024 weeks (19.6 years). GPS week zero started at 00:00:00 UTC (00:00:19 TAI) on January 6, 1980, and the week number became zero again for the first time at 23:59:47 UTC on August 21, 1999 (00:00:19 TAI on August 22, 1999). To determine the current Gregorian date, a GPS receiver must be provided with the approximate date (to within 3,584 days) to correctly translate the GPS date signal. To address this concern the modernized GPS navigation message uses a 13-bit field, which only repeats every 8,192 weeks (157 years), thus lasting until the year 2137 (157 years after GPS week zero).

== Carrier-phase tracking (surveying) ==
Utilizing the navigation message to measure pseudorange has been discussed. Another method that is used in GPS surveying applications is carrier-phase tracking. The period of the carrier frequency times the speed of light gives the wavelength, which is about 0.19 meters for the L1 carrier. With a 1% of wavelength accuracy in detecting the leading edge, this component of pseudorange error might be as low as 2 millimeters. This compares to 3 meters for the C/A code and 0.3 meters for the P code.

However, this 2-millimeter accuracy requires measuring the total phase, that is the total number of wavelengths plus the fractional wavelength. This requires specially equipped receivers. This method has many applications in the field of surveying.

We now describe a method that could potentially be used to estimate the position of receiver 2 given the position of receiver 1 using triple differencing followed by numerical root finding and a mathematical technique called [[least squares]]. A detailed discussion of the errors is omitted in order to avoid detracting from the description of the methodology. In this description differences are taken in the order of differencing between satellites, differencing between receivers, and differencing between epochs. This should not be construed to mean that this is the only order that can be used. Indeed, other orders of taking differences are equally valid.

The satellite carrier total phase can be measured with ambiguity as to the number of cycles. Let &lt;math&gt;\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k)&lt;/math&gt; denote the phase of the carrier of satellite ''j'' measured by receiver ''i'' at time &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt;. This notation has been chosen so as to make it clear what the subscripts ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' mean. In view of the fact that the receiver, satellite, and time come in alphabetical order as arguments of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and to strike a balance between readability and conciseness, let &lt;math&gt;\phi_{i,j,k} = \phi(r_i, s_j, t_k)&lt;/math&gt;, so as to have a concise abbreviation. Also we define three functions: &lt;math&gt;\Delta^r, \Delta^s, \Delta^t&lt;/math&gt;, which perform differences between receivers, satellites, and time points respectively. Each of these functions has a linear combination of variables with three subscripts as its argument. These three functions are defined below. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i,j,k}&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the three integer arguments ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'', then it is a valid argument for the functions &lt;math&gt;\Delta^r, \Delta^s, \Delta^t &lt;/math&gt;, with the values defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^r(\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \alpha_{i+1,j,k} - \alpha_{i,j,k},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^s(\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \alpha_{i,j+1,k} - \alpha_{i,j,k},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^t(\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \alpha_{i,j,k+1} - \alpha_{i,j,k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also if &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i,j,k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt; are valid arguments for the three functions, and ''a'' and ''b'' are constants, then &lt;math&gt;(a \alpha_{i,j,k} + b \beta_{l,m,n})&lt;/math&gt; is a valid argument with values defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^r(a \alpha_{i,j,k} + b \beta_{l,m,n}) = a \Delta^r(\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \Delta^r(\beta_{l,m,n}),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^s(a \alpha_{i,j,k} + b \beta_{l,m,n}) = a \Delta^s(\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \Delta^s(\beta_{l,m,n}),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^t(a \alpha_{i,j,k} + b \beta_{l,m,n}) = a \Delta^t(\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \Delta^t(\beta_{l,m,n}).&lt;/math&gt;

Receiver-clock errors can be approximately eliminated by differencing the phases measured from satellite 1 with that from satellite 2 at the same epoch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm Between-satellite differencing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306051358/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm |date=2011-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference is designated as &lt;math&gt;\Delta^s(\phi_{1,1,1}) = \phi_{1,2,1} - \phi_{1,1,1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Double differencing can be performed by taking the differences of the between satellite difference observed by receiver 1 with that observed by receiver 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm Double differencing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306051809/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm |date=2011-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite-clock errors will be approximately eliminated by this between receiver differencing. This double difference is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \Delta^r(\Delta^s(\phi_{1,1,1})) &amp;= \Delta^r(\phi_{1,2,1} - \phi_{1,1,1}) 
                                  &amp;= \Delta^r(\phi_{1,2,1}) - \Delta^r(\phi_{1,1,1})
                                  &amp;= (\phi_{2,2,1}  - \phi_{1,2,1}) - (\phi_{2,1,1} - \phi_{1,1,1}).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Triple differencing can be performed by taking the difference of double differencing performed at time &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; with that performed at time &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/636.htm Triple differencing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306051924/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/636.htm |date=2011-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This will eliminate the ambiguity associated with the integral number of wavelengths in carrier phase, provided this ambiguity does not change with time. Thus the triple difference result has eliminated all or practically all clock bias errors and the integer ambiguity. Also errors associated with atmospheric delay and satellite ephemeris have been significantly reduced. This triple difference is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^t(\Delta^r(\Delta^s(\phi_{1,1,1}))).&lt;/math&gt;

Triple difference results can be used to estimate unknown variables. For example, if the position of receiver 1 is known, but the position of receiver 2 unknown, it may be possible to estimate the position of receiver 2 using numerical root finding and [[least squares]]. Triple difference results for three independent time pairs quite possibly will be sufficient to solve for the three components of position of receiver 2. This may require the use of a numerical procedure such as one of those found in the chapter on root finding and nonlinear sets of equations in Numerical Recipes.&lt;ref name="NR"&gt;Press (1986), p. 959.&lt;/ref&gt; To use such a numerical method, an initial approximation of the position of receiver 2 is required. This initial value could probably be provided by a position approximation based on the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces. Although multidimensional numerical root finding can have problems, this disadvantage may be overcome with this good initial estimate. This procedure using three time pairs and a fairly good initial value followed by iteration will result in one observed triple-difference result for receiver 2 position. Greater accuracy may be obtained by processing triple-difference results for additional sets of three independent time pairs. This will result in an overdetermined system with multiple solutions. To get estimates for an overdetermined system, least squares can be used. The least-squares procedure determines the position of receiver 2 that best fits the observed triple-difference results for receiver 2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19126">The '''Herder Prize''' ({{lang-de|Gottfried-von-Herder-Preis}}), named after the German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], was a prestigious international prize awarded every year to scholars and artists from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeast Europe]] whose life and work have contributed to the cultural understanding of European countries and their peaceful interrelations. Established in 1963, the first prizes were awarded in 1964.

The prize jury was composed of German and Austrian universities. Financing for the Prize, which amounted to €15,000, was sponsored by the [[Alfred Toepfer Stiftung F.V.S.|Alfred Toepfer Foundation]] based in [[Hamburg]]. The awards were traditionally presented in an annual ceremony at the [[University of Vienna]] and handed over by the [[President of Austria]]. Each prize also included a one-year scholarship at an Austrian university given to a young person nominated by the winning scholar.

The prize was open to [[humanities]] scholars and artists from a wide variety of fields, including [[ethnographers]], writers, architects, composers, poets, folklorists, painters, historians, literary scholars, art historians, archeologists, theatre directors, musicologists, museologists, linguists, playwrights, etc. Several writers who received the Herder Prize went on to later win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], such as [[Wisława Szymborska]] (in 1995 and 1996), [[Imre Kertész]] (in 2000 and 2002), and [[Svetlana Alexievich]] (in 1999 and 2015), and many other recipients received other international accolades and were members of their [[national academy|national academies]].

Since its inception the prize was open to scholars and artists from seven central and southeast, mostly communist, European countries ([[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]] and [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]). After the [[fall of communism]] in Europe in the late 1980s and the subsequent turmoil which led to the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], scholars from all the succeeding countries remained eligible for the prize. In the early 1990s several ex-Soviet European countries (the Baltic nations of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]]; [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]) as well as [[Albania]] were also made eligible.

Usually seven recipients would be announced every year, except in 1964 (four), 1977 (eight), 1993 (nine), and in 2006 (five) — which was also the last edition of the Herder Prize. In 2007 the prize was discontinued and merged with other prize funds sponsored by the Alfred Toepfer Foundation to create a new Europe-wide annual award, the [[KAIROS Prize]], worth €75,000 and given to a single artist every year to encourage their innovative work.

The '''history of botany''' examines the human effort to understand life on Earth by tracing the historical development of the discipline of [[botany]]&amp;mdash;that part of natural science dealing with organisms traditionally treated as plants.

Rudimentary botanical science began with empirically-based plant lore passed from generation to generation in the oral traditions of [[paleolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s. The first written records of plants were made in the [[Neolithic Revolution]] about 10,000 years ago as writing was developed in the settled agricultural communities where plants and animals were first domesticated. The first writings that show human curiosity about plants themselves, rather than the uses that could be made of them, appears in the teachings of [[Aristotle's]] student [[Theophrastus]] at the [[Lyceum]] in ancient Athens in about 350 BC; this is considered the starting point for modern botany. In Europe, this early botanical science was soon overshadowed by a [[medieval]] preoccupation with the medicinal properties of plants that lasted more than 1000 years. During this time, the medicinal works of classical antiquity were reproduced in manuscripts and books called [[herbal]]s. In China and the Arab world, the [[Greco-Roman]] work on medicinal plants was preserved and extended.

In Europe the [[Renaissance]] of the 14th&amp;ndash;17th centuries heralded a scientific revival during which botany gradually emerged from [[natural history]] as an independent science, distinct from medicine and agriculture. [[Herbal]]s were replaced by [[Flora (publication)|floras]]: books that described the native plants of local regions. The invention of the [[microscope]] stimulated the study of [[plant anatomy]], and the first carefully designed experiments in [[plant physiology]] were performed. With the expansion of trade and exploration beyond Europe, the many new plants being discovered were subjected to an increasingly rigorous process of [[nomenclature|naming]], description, and [[Biological classification|classification]].

Progressively more sophisticated scientific technology has aided the development of contemporary botanical offshoots in the plant sciences, ranging from the applied fields of [[economic botany]] (notably agriculture, horticulture and forestry), to the detailed examination of the structure and function of plants and their interaction with the environment over many scales from the large-scale global significance of vegetation and plant communities ([[biogeography]] and [[ecology]]) through to the small scale of subjects like [[cell theory]], [[molecular biology]] and plant [[biochemistry]].

==Introduction==
{{Main article|Outline of botany}}

[[Botany]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|Βοτάνη}} - grass, fodder; [[Medieval Latin]] ''{{Lang|la|botanicus}}'' – herb, plant)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[zoology]] are, historically, the core disciplines of [[biology]] whose history is closely associated with the natural sciences [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[geology]]. A distinction can be made between botanical science in a pure sense, as the study of plants themselves, and botany as applied science, which studies the human use of plants. Early [[natural history]] divided pure botany into three main streams [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]-[[Biological classification|classification]], [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] – that is, external form, internal structure, and functional operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sachs|1890|p=v}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious topics in applied botany are [[horticulture]], [[forestry]] and [[agriculture]] although there are many others like [[invasive species|weed science]], [[plant pathology]], [[floristry]], [[pharmacognosy]], [[economic botany]] and [[ethnobotany]] which lie outside modern courses in botany. Since the origin of botanical science there has been a progressive increase in the scope of the subject as technology has opened up new techniques and areas of study. Modern [[molecular systematics]], for example, entails the principles and techniques of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[molecular biology]], [[computer science]] and more.

Within botany there are a number of sub-disciplines that focus on particular plant groups, each with their own range of related studies (anatomy, morphology etc.). Included here are: [[phycology]] ([[algae]]), [[pteridology]] ([[fern]]s), [[bryology]] ([[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]]) and [[palaeobotany]] (fossil plants) and their histories are treated elsewhere (see side bar). To this list can be added [[mycology]], the study of [[fungi]], which were once treated as plants, but are now ranked as a unique kingdom.

==Ancient knowledge==
{{Main article|Neolithic Revolution}}
[[Nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]] societies passed on, by [[oral tradition]], what they knew (their empirical observations) about the different kinds of plants that they used for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies and rituals etc. The uses of plants by these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classified&amp;mdash;their uses were embedded in [[folk taxonomy|folk-taxonomies]], the way they were grouped according to use in everyday communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Walters|1981|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nomadic life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the [[Neolithic Revolution]] which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the [[domestication|domestication of plants]] and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture from one generation to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plant lore and plant selection===
{{further|Cultivated plant taxonomy|Herbal}}
[[File:ClaySumerianSickle.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;A [[Sumer]]ian harvester's [[sickle]] dated to 3000 BC&lt;/center&gt;]]
During the Neolithic Revolution plant knowledge increased most obviously through the use of plants for food and medicine. All of today's [[staple food]]s were domesticated in [[prehistoric]] times as a gradual process of selection of higher-yielding varieties took place, possibly unknowingly, over hundreds to thousands of years. [[Legume]]s were cultivated on all continents but cereals made up most of the regular diet: [[rice]] in East Asia, [[wheat]] and [[barley]] in the Middle east, and [[maize]] in Central and South America. By Greco-Roman times popular food plants of today, including [[grape]]s, [[apple]]s, [[ficus|fig]]s, and [[olive]]s, were being listed as named varieties in early manuscripts.{{sfn|Stearn|1986}} Botanical authority [[William Stearn]] has observed that "''cultivated plants are mankind's most vital and precious heritage from remote antiquity''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stearn|1965|pp=279–91, 322–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also from the Neolithic, in about 3000 BC, that we glimpse the first known illustrations of plants&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and read descriptions of impressive gardens in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However protobotany, the first pre-scientific written record of plants, did not begin with food; it was born out of the medicinal literature of [[Egypt]], [[China]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|pp=7–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that agriculture was the occupation of the poor and uneducated, while medicine was the realm of socially influential [[shaman]]s, [[priest]]s, [[apothecary|apothecaries]], [[magician (paranormal)|magician]]s and [[physician]]s, who were more likely to record their knowledge for posterity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early botany===
;Ancient India
An early example of ancient Indian plant classification is found in the [[Rigveda]], a collection of [[Vedic Sanskrit]] hymns from about 3700–3100 [[Before Present|BP]]. Plants are divided into ''{{lang|sa|vṛska}}'' (trees), ''{{lang|sa|osadhi}}'' (herbs useful to humans) and ''{{lang|sa|virudha}}'' (creepers), with further subdivisions. The sacred [[Hindu]] text [[Atharvaveda]] divides plants into eight classes: ''{{lang|sa|visakha}}'' (spreading branches), ''{{lang|sa|manjari}}'' (leaves with long clusters{{clarification needed|reason=what does this refer to? Clusters of what? Leaves don't have clusters|date=November 2017}}), ''{{lang|sa|sthambini}}'' (bushy plants), ''{{lang|sa|prastanavati}}'' (which expands); ''{{lang|sa|ekasṛnga}}'' (those with [[monopodial]] growth), ''{{lang|sa|pratanavati}}'' (creeping plants), ''{{lang|sa|amsumati}}'' (with many stalks), and ''{{lang|sa|kandini}}'' (plants with knotty joints). The [[Taittiriya Samhita]] classifies the plant kingdom into ''{{lang|sa|vṛksa}}'', ''{{lang|sa|vana}}'' and ''{{lang|sa|druma}}'' (trees), ''{{lang|sa|visakha}}'' (shrubs with spreading branches), ''{{lang|sa|sasa}}'' (herbs), ''{{lang|sa|amsumali}}'' (spreading plant), ''{{lang|sa|vratati}}'' (climber), ''{{lang|sa|stambini}}'' (bushy plant), ''{{lang|sa|pratanavati}}'' (creeper), and ''{{lang|sa|alasala}}'' (spreading on the ground). Other examples of early Indian taxonomy include [[Manusmriti]], the Law book of [[Hindu]]s, which classifies plants into eight major categories. Elaborate taxonomies also occur in the [[Charaka Samhitā]], [[Sushruta Samhita]] and [[Vaisesika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Morton|1981| p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ancient China
In [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] lists of different plants and herb concoctions for [[pharmaceutical]] purposes date back to at least the time of the [[Warring States]] (481 BC-221 BC). Many Chinese writers over the centuries contributed to the written knowledge of herbal pharmaceutics. The [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC-220 AD) includes the notable work of the [[Huangdi Neijing]] and the famous pharmacologist [[Zhang Zhongjing]]. There were also the 11th century scientists and statesmen [[Su Song]] and [[Shen Kuo]] who compiled learned treatises on natural history, emphasising herbal medicine.{{sfn|Needham et al|1986}}

===Theophrastus and the origin of botanical science===
{{Main article|Theophrastus}}
[[File:Sanzio 01 cropped.png|thumb|left|600px|&lt;center&gt;"[[School of Athens]]" &lt;br&gt;[[Fresco]] in [[Apostolic Palace]], Rome, [[Vatican City]], by [[Raphael]] 1509-1510&lt;/center&gt;]] 
Ancient Athens, of the 6th century BC, was the busy trade centre at the confluence of [[Egypt]]ian, [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Minoa]]n cultures at the height of Greek colonisation of the Mediterranean. The philosophical thought of this period ranged freely through many subjects. [[Empedocles]] (490&amp;ndash;430 BC) foreshadowed Darwinian evolutionary theory in a crude formulation of the mutability of species and [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physician [[Hippocrates]] (460&amp;ndash;370 BC) avoided the prevailing superstition of his day and approached healing by close observation and the test of experience. At this time a genuine non-[[anthropocentric]] curiosity about plants emerged. The major works written about plants extended beyond the description of their medicinal uses to the topics of plant geography, morphology, physiology, nutrition, growth and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foremost among the scholars studying botany was [[Theophrastus]] of Eressus ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Θεόφραστος}}; c. 371&amp;ndash;287 BC) who has been frequently referred to as the "Father of Botany". He was a student and close friend of [[Aristotle]] (384&amp;ndash;322 BC) and succeeded him as head of the [[Lyceum]] (an educational establishment like a modern university) in Athens with its tradition of [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] philosophy. Aristotle's special treatise on plants — {{lang|el|θεωρία περὶ φυτῶν}} — is now lost, although there are many botanical observations scattered throughout his other writings (these have been assembled by [[Christian Friedrich Heinrich Wimmer|Christian Wimmer]] in ''{{lang|la|Phytologiae Aristotelicae Fragmenta}}'', 1836) but they give little insight into his botanical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Vines in {{Harvnb|Oliver|1913|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lyceum prided itself in a tradition of systematic observation of causal connections, critical experiment and rational theorizing. Theophrastus challenged the superstitious medicine employed by the physicians of his day, called rhizotomi, and also the control over medicine exerted by priestly authority and tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=29–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Aristotle he had tutored [[Alexander I of Macedon|Alexander the Great]] whose military conquests were carried out with all the scientific resources of the day, the Lyceum garden probably containing many botanical trophies collected during his campaigns as well as other explorations in distant lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singer|1923|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this garden where he gained much of his plant knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Teofrasto Orto botanico detail.jpg|thumb|150px|right|&lt;center&gt;Statue of [[Theophrastus]] 371–287 BC&lt;br&gt; "Father of Botany" &lt;br&gt; [[Orto botanico di Palermo|Palermo Botanic Gardens]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
Theophrastus's major botanical works were the ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Enquiry into Plants]]'' (''Historia Plantarum'') and ''Causes of Plants'' (''Causae Plantarum'') which were his lecture notes for the Lyceum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening sentence of the ''Enquiry'' reads like a botanical [[manifesto]]: "''We must consider the distinctive characters and the general nature of plants from the point of view of their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], their behaviour under external conditions, their mode of generation and the whole course of their life''". The ''Enquiry'' is 9 books of "applied" botany dealing with the forms and [[Biological classification|classification]] of plants and [[economic botany]], examining the techniques of [[agriculture]] (relationship of crops to soil, climate, water and habitat) and [[horticulture]]. He described some 500 plants in detail, often including descriptions of habitat and geographic distribution, and he recognised some plant groups that can be recognised as modern-day plant families. Some names he used, like ''[[Crataegus]]'', ''[[Daucus]]'' and ''[[Asparagus]]'' have persisted until today. His second book ''Causes of Plants'' covers plant growth and reproduction (akin to modern physiology).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Aristotle he grouped plants into "trees", "undershrubs", "shrubs" and "herbs" but he also made several other important botanical distinctions and observations. He noted that plants could be [[annual plant|annual]]s, [[perennial]]s and [[Biennial plant|biennials]], they were also either [[monocotyledon]]s or [[dicotyledon]]s and he also noticed the difference between [[determinate growth|determinate]] and indeterminate growth and details of floral structure including the degree of fusion of the petals, position of the ovary and more.{{sfn|Thanos|2005}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=36–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lecture notes of Theophrastus comprise the first clear exposition of the rudiments of plant anatomy, physiology, morphology and ecology — presented in a way that would not be matched for another eighteen centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harvey-Gibson|1919|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the study of medicinal plants was not being neglected and a full synthesis of ancient Greek pharmacology was compiled in ''Materia Medica'' c. 60 AD by [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] (c. 40-90 AD) who was a Greek physician with the Roman army. This work proved to be the definitive text on medicinal herbs, both oriental and occidental, for fifteen hundred years until the dawn of the European [[Renaissance]] being slavishly copied again and again throughout this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singer|1923|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though rich in medicinal information with descriptions of about 600 medicinal herbs, the botanical content of the work was extremely limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
{{Main article|Roman agriculture}}
The Romans contributed little to the foundations of botanical science laid by the ancient Greeks, but made a sound contribution to our knowledge of applied botany as agriculture. In works titled ''{{lang|la|De Re Rustica}}'' four Roman writers contributed to a compendium ''Scriptores Rei Rusticae'', published from the Renaissance on, which set out the principles and practice of agriculture. These authors were [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] (234–149 BC), [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] (116–27 BC) and, in particular, [[Columella]] (4–70 AD) and [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]] (4th century AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman encyclopaedist [[Gaius Plinius Secundus|Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 AD) deals with plants in Books 12 to 26 of his 37-volume highly influential work ''{{lang|la|[[Naturalis Historia]]}}'' in which he frequently quotes Theophrastus but with a lack of botanical insight although he does, nevertheless, draw a distinction between true botany on the one hand, and farming and medicine on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=70–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that at the time of the Roman Empire between 1300 and 1400 plants had been recorded in the West.{{sfn|Sengbusch|2004}}

== Medieval knowledge ==

===Medicinal plants of the early Middle Ages===
{{further|Herbalism|Chinese medicine|Byzantine medicine|Islamic medicine}}
[[File:Canon ibnsina arabic.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;An [[Arabic language|Arabic]] copy of [[Avicenna]]'s ''Canon of Medicine'' dated 1593&lt;/center&gt;]]
In Western Europe, after Theophrastus, botany passed through a bleak period of 1800 years when little progress was made and, indeed, many of the early insights were lost. As Europe entered the [[Middle Ages]] (5th to 15th centuries), a period of disorganised feudalism and indifference to learning, China, India and the Arab world enjoyed a golden age. Chinese philosophy had followed a similar path to that of the ancient Greeks. The Chinese dictionary-encyclopaedia [[Erh Ya]] probably dates from about 300 BC and describes about 334 plants classed as trees or shrubs, each with a common name and illustration. Between 100 and 1700 AD many new works on pharmaceutical botany were produced including encyclopaedic accounts and treatises compiled for the Chinese imperial court. These were free of superstition and myth with carefully researched descriptions and nomenclature; they included cultivation information and notes on economic and medicinal uses — and even elaborate monographs on ornamental plants. But there was no experimental method and no analysis of the plant sexual system, nutrition, or anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=58–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 400-year period from the 9th to 13th centuries AD was the [[Islamic Renaissance]], a time when Islamic culture and science thrived. Greco-Roman texts were preserved, copied and extended although new texts always emphasised the medicinal aspects of plants. [[Kurd]]ish biologist [[Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī|Ābu Ḥanīfah Āḥmad ibn Dawūd Dīnawarī]] (828–896 AD) is known as the founder of Arabic botany; his ''Kitâb al-nabât'' (‘Book of Plants’) describes 637 species, discussing plant development from germination to senescence and including details of flowers and fruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fahd|1996|p=815}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mutazilite]] [[philosopher]] and physician [[Ibn Sina]] ([[Avicenna]]) (c. 980–1037 AD) was another influential figure, his ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' being a landmark in the history of medicine treasured until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Morton 1981 82"&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India simple artificial plant classification systems of the [[Rigveda]], [[Atharvaveda]] and [[Taittiriya Samhita]] became more botanical with the work of [[Parashara]] (c. 400 – c. 500 AD), the author of ''Vṛksayurveda'' (the science of life of trees). He made close observations of cells and leaves and divided plants into Dvimatrka ([[Dicotyledon]]s) and Ekamatrka ([[Monocotyledon]]s). The dicotyledons were further classified into groupings (ganas) akin to modern floral families: ''Samiganiya'' ([[Fabaceae]]), ''Puplikagalniya'' ([[Rutaceae]]), ''Svastikaganiya'' ([[Cruciferae]]), ''Tripuspaganiya'' ([[Cucurbitaceae]]), ''Mallikaganiya'' ([[Apocynaceae]]), and ''Kurcapuspaganiya'' ([[Asteraceae]]).{{sfn|Tiwari|2003}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Majumdar|1982|pages=356–411}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important medieval Indian works of plant physiology include the ''Prthviniraparyam'' of [[Udayana]], ''Nyayavindutika'' of Dharmottara, ''Saddarsana-samuccaya'' of Gunaratna, and ''Upaskara'' of Sankaramisra.

=== The Silk Road ===
Following the [[fall of Constantinople]] (1453), the newly expanded [[Ottoman Empire]] welcomed European embassies in its capital, which in turn became the sources of plants from those regions to the east which traded with the empire. In the following century twenty times as many plants entered Europe along the [[Silk Road]] as had been transported in the previous two thousand years, mainly as bulbs. Others were acquired primarily for their alleged medicinal value. Initially Italy benefited from this new knowledge, especially [[Venice]], which traded extensively with the East. From there these new plants rapidly spread to the rest of Western Europe.&lt;ref name=Pavord11/&gt; By the middle of the sixteenth century there was already a flourishing export trade of various bulbs from Turkey to Europe.{{sfn|Pavord|1999}}

===The Age of Herbals===
{{Main article|Herbal}}
[[File:Dioscorides De Materia Medica Byzantium 15th century.jpg|thumb|170px|right|&lt;center&gt;Dioscorides', ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'', [[Byzantium]], 15th century.&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the European [[Middle Ages]] of the 15th and 16th centuries the lives of European citizens were based around agriculture but when printing arrived, with movable type and [[woodcut]] illustrations, it was not treatises on agriculture that were published, but lists of medicinal plants with descriptions of their properties or "virtues". These first plant books, known as [[herbal]]s showed that botany was still a part of medicine, as it had been for most of ancient history.&lt;ref name="Morton 1981 82"/&gt; Authors of herbals were often curators of university gardens,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sachs|1890|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most herbals were derivative compilations of classic texts, especially ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]''. However, the need for accurate and detailed plant descriptions meant that some herbals were more botanical than medicinal. German [[Otto Brunfels]]'s (1464–1534) ''Herbarum Vivae Icones'' (1530) contained descriptions of about 47 species new to science combined with accurate illustrations. His fellow countryman [[Hieronymus Bock]]'s (1498–1554) ''Kreutterbuch'' of 1539 described plants he found in nearby woods and fields and these were illustrated in the 1546 edition.&lt;ref name=Reed4265&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was [[Valerius Cordus]] (1515–1544) who pioneered the formal botanical description that detailed both flowers and fruits, some anatomy including the number of chambers in the [[ovary]], and the type of [[ovule]] [[placentation]]. He also made observations on pollen and distinguished between [[inflorescence]] types.&lt;ref name=Reed4265 /&gt; His five-volume ''Historia Plantarum'' was published about 18 years after his early death aged 29 in 1561-1563. In Holland [[Rembert Dodoens]] (1517–1585), in ''Stirpium Historiae'' (1583), included descriptions of many new species from the Netherlands in a scientific arrangement&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in England [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]] (1515–1568) in his ''Libellus De Re Herbaria Novus'' (1538) published names, descriptions and localities of many native British plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arber|1986|pp=119–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbals contributed to botany by setting in train the science of plant description, classification, and botanical illustration. Up to the 17th century botany and medicine were one and the same but those books emphasising medicinal aspects eventually omitted the plant lore to become modern pharmacopoeias; those that omitted the medicine became more botanical and evolved into the modern compilations of plant descriptions we call [[Flora]]s. These were often backed by specimens deposited in a [[herbarium]] which was a collection of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras. The transition from herbal to Flora marked the final separation of botany from medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Arber in {{Harvnb|Oliver|1913|pp=146–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Renaissance and Age of Enlightenment (1550–1800) ==

The revival of learning during the European [[Renaissance]] renewed interest in plants. The church, feudal aristocracy and an increasingly influential merchant class that supported science and the arts, now jostled in a world of increasing trade. Sea voyages of exploration returned botanical treasures to the large public, private, and newly established botanic gardens, and introduced an eager population to novel crops, drugs and spices from Asia, the [[East Indies]] and the [[New World]].

The number of scientific publications increased. In England, for example, scientific communication and causes were facilitated by learned societies like Royal Society (founded in 1660) and the [[Linnaean Society]] (founded in 1788): there was also the support and activities of botanical institutions like the [[Jardin du Roi]] in Paris, [[Chelsea Physic Garden]], [[Royal Botanic Gardens Kew]], and the [[Oxford Botanic Garden|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge Botanic Garden]]s, as well as the influence of renowned private gardens and wealthy entrepreneurial nurserymen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henrey|1975|pp=631–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 17th century the number of plants described in Europe had risen to about 6000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values of reason and science coupled with new voyages to distant lands instigating another phase of encyclopaedic plant identification, nomenclature, description and illustration, "flower painting" possibly at its best in this period of history.{{sfn|Buck|2017}}{{sfn|Jacobson|2014}} Plant trophies from distant lands decorated the gardens of Europe's powerful and wealthy in a period of enthusiasm for natural history, especially botany (a preoccupation sometimes referred to as "botanophilia") that is never likely to recur.{{sfn|Williams|2001}} Often such exotic new plant imports (primarily from Turkey), when they first appeared in print in English, lacked common names in the language.{{sfn|Jacobson|2014}}

During the 18th century botany was one of the few sciences considered appropriate for genteel educated women. Around 1760, with the popularization of the Linnaean system, botany became much more widespread among educated women who painted plants, attended classes on plant classification, and collected herbarium specimens although emphasis was on the healing properties of plants rather than plant reproduction which had overtones of sexuality. Women began publishing on botanical topics and children's books on botany appeared by authors like [[Charlotte Turner Smith]]. Cultural authorities argued that education through botany created culturally and scientifically aware citizens, part of the thrust for 'improvement' that characterised the Enlightenment. However, in the early 19th century with the recognition of botany as an official science, women were again excluded from the discipline.{{sfn|Shteir|1996|loc=Prologue}}

===Botanical gardens and herbaria===
{{further|Botanical garden|List of botanical gardens|Herbarium}}
[[File:Orto dei semplici PD 01.jpg|thumb|A 16th century print of the [[Orto botanico di Padova|Botanical Garden of Padova]] (''Garden of the Simples'') — the oldest academic botanic garden that is still in its original location]]
[[File:HerbPrepLG.jpg|thumb|Preparing a herbarium specimen]]
Public and private gardens have always been strongly associated with the historical unfolding of botanical science.&lt;ref name=Spencer&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|2017|pp=43-93}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
Early botanical gardens were physic gardens, repositories for the medicinal plants described in the herbals. As they were generally associated with universities or other academic institutions the plants were also used for study. The directors of these gardens were eminent physicians with an educational role as "scientific gardeners" and it was staff of these institutions that produced many of the published herbals.

The botanical gardens of the modern tradition were established in northern Italy, the first being at [[Orto botanico di Pisa|Pisa]] (1544), founded by [[Luca Ghini]] (1490–1556). Although part of a medical faculty, the first chair of ''{{lang|la|materia medica}}'', essentially a chair in botany, was established in Padua in 1533. Then in 1534, Ghini became Reader in ''{{lang|la|materia medica}}'' at Bologna University, where Aldrovandi established a similar garden in 1568 (see below).{{sfn|Conan|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3y4VbYgwPrIC&amp;pg=PA96 p.&amp;nbsp;96]}}  Collections of pressed and dried specimens were called a ''{{lang|la|hortus siccus}}'' (garden of dry plants) and the first accumulation of plants in this way (including the use of a plant press) is attributed to Ghini.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sachs|1890|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=120–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings called [[herbarium|herbaria]] housed these specimens mounted on card with descriptive labels. Stored in cupboards in systematic order they could be preserved in perpetuity and easily transferred or exchanged with other institutions, a taxonomic procedure that is still used today.

By the 18th century the physic gardens had been transformed into "order beds" that demonstrated the classification systems that were being devised by botanists of the day — but they also had to accommodate the influx of curious, beautiful and new plants pouring in from voyages of exploration that were associated with European colonial expansion.

===From Herbal to Flora===
{{Main article|Flora}}
Plant classification systems of the 17th and 18th centuries now related plants to one another and not to man, marking a return to the non-anthropocentric botanical science promoted by Theophrastus over 1500 years before. In England, various herbals in either [[Latin]] or English were mainly compilations and translations of continental European works, of limited relevance to the British Isles. This included the rather unreliable work of [[John Gerard|Gerard]] (1597).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gerard|1597}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first systematic attempt to collect information on British plants was that of [[Thomas Johnson (botanist)|Thomas Johnson]] (1629),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1629}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pavord|2005|pp=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was later to issue his own revision of Gerard's work (1633–1636).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However Johnson was not the first apothecary or physician to organise botanical expeditions to [[Systematics|systematise]] their local flora. In Italy [[Ulysse Aldrovandi]] (1522 – 1605) organised an expedition to the [[Sibylline mountains]] in [[Umbria]] in 1557, and compiled a local [[Flora]]. He then began to disseminate his findings amongst other European scholars, forming an early network of [[knowledge sharing]] "''molti amici in molti luoghi''" (many friends in many places),{{sfn|Conan|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3y4VbYgwPrIC&amp;pg=PA121 pp.&amp;nbsp;121, 123]}}{{sfn|Bethencourt|Egmond|2007}} including Charles de l'Écluse ([[Carolus Clusius|Clusius]]) (1526 – 1609) at [[Montpellier]] and Jean de Brancion at [[Malines]]. Between them they started developing Latin names for plants, in addition to their common names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pavord|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exchange of information and specimens between scholars was often associated with the founding of [[#Botanical gardens and herbaria|botanical gardens]] (above), and to this end Aldrovandi founded one of the earliest at his university in [[Bologna]], the [[Orto Botanico di Bologna]] in 1568.{{sfn|Conan|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3y4VbYgwPrIC&amp;pg=PA96 p.&amp;nbsp;96]}}

In France, Clusius journeyed throughout most of [[Western Europe]], making discoveries in the vegetable kingdom along the way. He compiled Flora of Spain (1576), and Austria and Hungary (1583). He was the first to propose dividing plants into classes.{{sfn|Helmsley|Poole|2004}}&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Meyer|1854"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyer|1854–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in Switzerland, from 1554, [[Conrad Gessner]] (1516 – 1565) made regular explorations of the [[Swiss Alps]] from his native [[Zurich]] and  discovered many new plants. He proposed that there were groups or genera of plants.  He said that each genus was composed of many species and that these were defined by similar flowers and fruits. This principle of organization laid the groundwork for future botanists. He wrote his important ''[[Historia Plantarum (Gessner)|Historia Plantarum]]'' shortly before his death. At Malines, in [[Flanders]] he established and maintained the botanical gardens of Jean de Brancion from 1568 to 1573, and first encountered [[tulips]].{{sfn|Willes|2011|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=wAxLU3bo3kwC&amp;pg=PA76 p.&amp;nbsp;76]}}{{sfn|Goldgar|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gViwLbCJ7X0C&amp;pg=PA34 p.&amp;nbsp;34]}}

This approach coupled with the new Linnaean system of [[binomial nomenclature]] resulted in plant encyclopaedias without medicinal information called ''Floras'' that meticulously described and illustrated the plants growing in particular regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arber|1986|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th century also marked the beginning of experimental botany and application of a rigorous scientific method, while improvements in the microscope launched the new discipline of plant anatomy whose foundations, laid by the careful observations of Englishman [[Nehemiah Grew]]&lt;ref&gt;Arber in {{Harvnb|Oliver|1913|pp=44–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian [[Marcello Malpighi]], would last for 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=178–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Botanical exploration===
{{Main article|Plant geography}}
More new lands were opening up to European colonial powers, the botanical riches being returned to European botanists for description. This was a romantic era of botanical explorers, intrepid [[plant collecting|plant hunters]] and gardener-botanists. Significant botanical collections came from: the West Indies ([[Hans Sloane]] (1660–1753)); China (James Cunningham); the spice islands of the East Indies (Moluccas, [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius|George Rumphius]] (1627–1702)); China and Mozambique ([[João de Loureiro]] (1717–1791)); West Africa ([[Michel Adanson]] (1727–1806)) who devised his own classification scheme and forwarded a crude theory of the mutability of species; Canada, Hebrides, Iceland, New Zealand by [[Captain James Cook]]'s chief botanist [[Joseph Banks]] (1743–1820).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|pp=110–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification and morphology===
{{further|List of systems of plant taxonomy|Plant taxonomy|History of plant systematics}}
[[File:Carl von Linné.jpg|left|thumb|150px|&lt;center&gt; Portrait of Carl Linnaeus by [[Alexander Roslin]], 1775&lt;/center&gt;]]
By the middle of the 18th century the botanical booty resulting from the era of exploration was accumulating in gardens and herbaria – and it needed to be systematically catalogued. This was the task of the taxonomists, the plant classifiers.

Plant classifications have changed over time from "artificial" systems based on general habit and form, to pre-evolutionary "natural" systems expressing similarity using one to many characters, leading to post-evolutionary "natural" systems that use characters to infer [[phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodland|1991|pp=372–408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian physician [[Andrea Caesalpino]] (1519–1603) studied medicine and taught botany at the [[University of Pisa]] for about 40 years eventually becoming Director of the [[Orto Botanico di Pisa|Botanic Garden of Pisa]] from 1554 to 1558. His sixteen-volume ''De Plantis'' (1583) described 1500 plants and his [[herbarium]] of 260 pages and 768 mounted specimens still remains. Caesalpino proposed classes based largely on the detailed structure of the flowers and fruit;&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Meyer|1854"/&gt;  he also applied the concept of the genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|pp=71–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to try and derive principles of natural classification reflecting the overall similarities between plants and he produced a classification scheme well in advance of its day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=130–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaspard Bauhin]] (1560–1624) produced two influential publications ''{{lang|la|Prodromus Theatrici Botanici}}'' (1620) and ''{{lang|la|Pinax}}'' (1623). These brought order to the 6000 species now described and in the latter he used binomials and synonyms that may well have influenced Linnaeus's thinking. He also insisted that taxonomy should be based on natural affinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=147–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Species plantarum 001.jpg|150px|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Cover page of ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' of Carl Linnaeus published in 1753&lt;/center&gt;]]
To sharpen the precision of description and classification [[Joachim Jung]] (1587–1657) compiled a much-needed botanical terminology which has stood the test of time. English botanist [[John Ray]] (1623–1705) built on Jung's work to establish the most elaborate and insightful classification system of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|pp=82–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His observations started with the local plants of Cambridge where he lived, with the ''{{lang|la|Catalogus Stirpium circa Cantabrigiam Nascentium}}'' (1860) which later expanded to his ''{{lang|la|Synopsis Methodica Stirpium Britannicarum}}'', essentially the first British Flora. Although his ''{{lang|la|Historia Plantarum}}'' (1682, 1688, 1704) provided a step towards a world Flora as he included more and more plants from his travels, first on the continent and then beyond. He extended Caesalpino's natural system with a more precise definition of the higher classification levels, deriving many modern families in the process, and asserted that all parts of plants were important in classification. He recognised that variation arises from both internal (genotypic) and external environmental (phenotypic) causes and that only the former was of taxonomic significance. He was also among the first experimental physiologists. The ''{{lang|la|Historia Plantarum}}'' can be regarded as the first botanical synthesis and textbook for modern botany. According to botanical historian Alan Morton, Ray "influenced both the theory and the practice of botany more decisively than any other single person in the latter half of the seventeenth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=196–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray's family system was later extended by [[Pierre Magnol]] (1638–1715) and [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|Joseph de Tournefort]] (1656–1708), a student of Magnol, achieved notoriety for his botanical expeditions, his emphasis on floral characters in classification, and for reviving the idea of the genus as the basic unit of classification.&lt;ref name=Woodland91372&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodland|1991|pp=372–375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Above all it was Swedish [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778) who eased the task of plant cataloguing. He adopted a sexual system of classification using stamens and pistils as important characters. Among his most important publications were [[Systema Naturae]] (1735), [[Genera Plantarum]] (1737), and [[Philosophia Botanica]] (1751) but it was in his [[Species Plantarum]] (1753) that he gave every species a [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] thus setting the path for the future accepted method of designating the names of all organisms. Linnaean thought and books dominated the world of taxonomy for nearly a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stafleu|1971| p= 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sexual system was later elaborated by [[Bernard de Jussieu]] (1699–1777) whose nephew [[Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu]] (1748–1836) extended it yet again to include about 100 orders (present-day families).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frenchman [[Michel Adanson]] (1727–1806) in his ''{{lang|fr|Familles des Plantes}}'' (1763, 1764), apart from extending the current system of family names, emphasized that a natural classification must be based on a consideration of all characters, even though these may later be given different emphasis according to their diagnostic value for the particular plant group. Adanson's method has, in essence, been followed to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=301–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

18th century plant taxonomy bequeathed to the 19th century a precise binomial nomenclature and botanical terminology, a system of classification based on natural affinities, and a clear idea of the ranks of family, genus and species — although the taxa to be placed within these ranks remains, as always, the subject of taxonomic research.

===Anatomy===
{{further|Microscopy|Plant anatomy}} 
[[File:Hooke Microscope-03000276-FIG-4.jpg|thumb|right|125px|&lt;center&gt;[[Robert Hooke]]'s microscope which he described in the 1665 ''{{lang|la|[[Micrographia]]}}'': he coined the biological use of the term ''[[cell (biology)|cell]]''&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the first half of the 18th century botany was beginning to move beyond descriptive science into experimental science. Although the [[microscope]] was invented in 1590 it was only in the late 17th century that lens grinding by [[Antony van Leeuwenhoek]] provided the resolution needed to make major discoveries. Important general biological observations were made by [[Robert Hooke]] (1635–1703) but the foundations of plant anatomy were laid by Italian [[Marcello Malpighi]] (1628–1694) of the University of Bologna in his ''{{lang|la|Anatome Plantarum}}'' (1675) and Royal Society Englishman [[Nehemiah Grew]] (1628–1711) in his ''The Anatomy of Plants Begun'' (1671) and ''Anatomy of Plants'' (1682). These botanists explored what is now called developmental anatomy and morphology by carefully observing, describing and drawing the developmental transition from seed to mature plant, recording stem and wood formation. This work included the discovery and naming of [[parenchyma]] and [[stomata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|pp=88–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiology===
{{Main article|Plant physiology}}
In plant physiology research interest was focused on the movement of sap and the absorption of substances through the roots. [[Jan Baptist van Helmont|Jan Helmont]] (1577–1644) by experimental observation and calculation, noted that the increase in weight of a growing plant cannot be derived purely from the soil, and concluded it must relate to water uptake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Englishman [[Stephen Hales]]&lt;ref&gt;Darwin in {{Harvnb|Oliver|1913|pp=65–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1677–1761) established by quantitative experiment that there is uptake of water by plants and a loss of water by transpiration and that this is influenced by environmental conditions: he distinguished "root pressure", "leaf suction" and "imbibition" and also noted that the major direction of sap flow in woody tissue is upward. His results were published in ''Vegetable Staticks'' (1727) He also noted that "air makes a very considerable part of the substance of vegetables".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; English chemist [[Joseph Priestley]] (1733–1804) is noted for his discovery of oxygen (as now called) and its production by plants. Later [[Jan Ingenhousz]] (1730–1799) observed that only in sunlight do the green parts of plants absorb air and release oxygen, this being more rapid in bright sunlight while, at night, the air (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is released from all parts. His results were published in ''Experiments upon vegetables'' (1779) and with this the foundations for 20th century studies of carbon fixation were laid. From his observations he sketched the cycle of carbon in nature even though the composition of carbon dioxide was yet to be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in plant nutrition had also progressed. In 1804 [[Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure]]'s (1767–1845) ''{{lang|fr|Recherches Chimiques sur la Végétation}}'' was an exemplary study of scientific exactitude that demonstrated the similarity of respiration in both plants and animals, that the fixation of carbon dioxide includes water, and that just minute amounts of salts and nutrients (which he analysed in chemical detail from plant ash) have a powerful influence on plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plant sexuality===
{{further|Plant sexuality|Alternation of generations}}
[[File:Mature flower diagram.svg|thumb|350px|left|&lt;center&gt;Diagram showing the sexual parts of a mature flower&lt;/center&gt;]]
It was [[Rudolf Jakob Camerarius|Rudolf Camerarius]] (1665–1721) who was the first to establish plant sexuality conclusively by experiment. He declared in a letter to a colleague dated 1694 and titled ''{{lang|la|De Sexu Plantarum Epistola}}'' that "no ovules of plants could ever develop into seeds from the female style and ovary without first being prepared by the pollen from the stamens, the male sexual organs of the plant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much was learned about plant sexuality by unravelling the reproductive mechanisms of mosses, liverworts and algae. In his ''{{lang|de|Vergleichende Untersuchungen}}'' of 1851 [[Wilhelm Hofmeister]] (1824–1877) starting with the ferns and bryophytes demonstrated that the process of sexual reproduction in plants entails an "alternation of generations" between [[sporophyte]]s and [[gametophyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiated the new field of [[comparative morphology]] which, largely through the combined work of [[William Gilson Farlow|William Farlow]] (1844–1919), [[Nathanael Pringsheim]] (1823–1894), [[Frederick Orpen Bower|Frederick Bower]], [[Eduard Strasburger]] and others, established that an "alternation of generations" occurs throughout the plant kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later the German academic and natural historian [[Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter|Joseph Kölreuter]] (1733–1806) extended this work by noting the function of nectar in attracting pollinators and the role of wind and insects in pollination. He also produced deliberate hybrids, observed the microscopic structure of pollen grains and how the transfer of matter from the pollen to the ovary inducing the formation of the embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Angiosperm life cycle diagram-en.svg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Angiosperm]] (flowering plant) life cycle showing alternation of generations&lt;/center&gt;]]One hundred years after Camerarius, in 1793, [[Christian Konrad Sprengel|Christian Sprengel]] (1750–1816) broadened the understanding of flowers by describing the role of nectar guides in pollination, the adaptive floral mechanisms used for pollination, and the prevalence of cross-pollination, even though male and female parts are usually together on the same flower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nineteenth-century foundations of modern botany==
In about the mid-19th century scientific communication changed. Until this time ideas were largely exchanged by reading the works of authoritative individuals who dominated in their field: these were often wealthy and influential "gentlemen scientists". Now research was reported by the publication of "papers" that emanated from research "schools" that promoted the questioning of conventional wisdom. This process had started in the late 18th century when specialist journals began to appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reynolds Green|1909|p=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, botany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first "modern" textbook, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]]'s (1804–1881) ''{{lang|de|Grundz&amp;uuml;ge der Wissenschaftlichen Botanik}}'', published in English in 1849 as ''Principles of Scientific Botany''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1850 an invigorated organic chemistry had revealed the structure of many plant constituents.&lt;ref name="Morton 1981 388"&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the great era of plant classification had now passed the work of description continued. [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|Augustin de Candolle]] (1778–1841) succeeded [[Antoine de Jussieu|Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu]] in managing the botanical project ''{{lang|la|[[Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis]]}}'' (1824–1841) which involved 35 authors: it contained all the dicotyledons known in his day, some 58000 species in 161 families, and he doubled the number of recognized plant families, the work being completed by his son [[Alphonse de Candolle|Alphonse]] (1806–1893) in the years from 1841 to 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plant geography and ecology===
{{further|Ecology|Plant community}}
[[File:AvHumboldt.jpg|thumb|right|140px|&lt;center&gt;[[Alexander von Humboldt]] 1769–1859 painted by [[Joseph Stieler]] in 1843&lt;/center&gt;]]
The opening of the 19th century was marked by an increase in interest in the connection between climate and plant distribution. [[Carl Ludwig Willdenow|Carl Willdenow]] (1765–1812) examined the connection between seed dispersal and distribution, the nature of plant associations and the impact of geological history. He noticed the similarities between the floras of N America and N Asia, the Cape and Australia, and he explored the ideas of "[[centre of diversity]]" and "[[centre of origin]]". German [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769–1859) and Frenchman [[Aime Bonpland]] (1773–1858) published a massive and highly influential 30 volume work on their travels; [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] (1773–1852) noted the similarities between the floras of S Africa, Australia and India, while [[Joakim Frederik Schouw|Joakim Schouw]] (1789–1852) explored more deeply than anyone else the influence on plant distribution of temperature, [[edaphic|soil]] factors, especially soil water, and light, work that was continued by [[Alphonse de Candolle]] (1806–1893).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] (1817–1911) pushed the boundaries of floristic studies with his work on Antarctica, India and the Middle East with special attention to [[endemism]]. [[August Grisebach]] (1814–1879) in ''{{lang|de|Die Vegetation der Erde}}'' (1872) examined [[physiognomy]] in relation to climate and in America geographic studies were pioneered by [[Asa Gray]] (1810–1888).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physiological plant geography, perhaps more familiarly termed [[ecology]], emerged from floristic biogeography in the late 19th century as environmental influences on plants received greater recognition. Early work in this area was synthesised by Danish professor [[Eugenius Warming]] (1841–1924) in his book ''{{lang|da|Plantesamfund}}'' (Ecology of Plants, generally taken to mark the beginning of modern ecology) including new ideas on plant communities, their adaptations and environmental influences. This was followed by another grand synthesis, the ''{{lang|de|Pflanzengeographie auf Physiologischer Grundlage}}'' of [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|Andreas Schimper]] (1856–1901) in 1898 (published in English in 1903 as Plant-geography upon a physiological basis translated by W. R. Fischer, Oxford: Clarendon press, 839 pp.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|pp=126–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anatomy===
{{further|Plant anatomy|Cell theory}}
[[File:Chloroplasten.jpg|thumb|180px|left|&lt;center&gt;Plant cells with visible [[chloroplasts]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
During the 19th century German scientists led the way towards a unitary theory of the structure and life-cycle of plants. Following improvements in the microscope at the end of the 18th century, [[Charles-François Brisseau de Mirbel|Charles Mirbel]] (1776–1854) in 1802 published his ''{{lang|fr|Traité d'Anatomie et de Physiologie Végétale}}'' and [[Johann Jacob Paul Moldenhawer|Johann Moldenhawer]] (1766–1827) published ''{{lang|de|Beyträge zur Anatomie der Pflanzen}}'' (1812) in which he describes techniques for separating cells from the middle [[Middle lamella|lamella]]. He identified [[vascular tissue|vascular]] and [[parenchyma]]tous tissues, described vascular bundles, observed the cells in the [[vascular cambium|cambium]], and interpreted tree rings. He found that [[stoma]]ta were composed of pairs of cells, rather than a single cell with a hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=368–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anatomical studies on the [[stele]] were consolidated by [[Carl Sanio]] (1832–1891) who described the secondary tissues and [[meristem]] including [[Meristem|cambium]] and its action. [[Hugo von Mohl]] (1805–1872) summarized work in anatomy leading up to 1850 in ''{{lang|de|Die Vegetabilische Zelle}}'' (1851) but this work was later eclipsed by the encyclopaedic comparative anatomy of [[Heinrich Anton de Bary]] in 1877. An overview of knowledge of the stele in root and stem was completed by [[Van Tieghem]] (1839–1914) and of the meristem by [[Karl Wilhelm von Nägeli|Karl Nägeli]] (1817–1891). Studies had also begun on the origins of the [[carpel]] and [[flower]] that continue to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=386–395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water relations===
{{Main article|Transpiration}}
The riddle of water and nutrient transport through the plant remained. Physiologist Von Mohl explored solute transport and the theory of water uptake by the roots using the concepts of cohesion, transpirational pull, capillarity and root pressure.&lt;ref name="Morton 1981 388"/&gt; German dominance in the field of physiology was underlined by the publication of the definitive textbook on plant physiology synthesising the work of this period, Sach's ''{{lang|de|Vorlesungen über Pflanzenphysiologi}}e'' of 1882. There were, however, some advances elsewhere such as the early exploration of [[geotropism]] (the effect of gravity on growth) by Englishman Thomas Knight, and the discovery and naming of [[osmosis]] by Frenchman [[Henri Dutrochet]] (1776–1847).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=390–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cytology===
{{Main article|Cell theory}}
The cell nucleus was discovered by [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] in 1831. Demonstration of the cellular composition of all organisms, with each cell possessing all the characteristics of life, is attributed to the combined efforts of botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist [[Theodor Schwann]] (1810–1882) in the early 19th century although Moldenhawer had already shown that plants were wholly cellular with each cell having its own wall and [[Julius von Sachs]] had shown the continuity [[protoplasm]] between [[cell wall]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=381–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1870 to 1880 it became clear that cell nuclei are never formed anew but always derived from the substance of another nucleus. In 1882 Flemming observed the longitudinal splitting of [[chromosome]]s in the dividing nucleus and concluded that each daughter nucleus received half of each of the chromosomes of the mother nucleus: then by the early 20th century it was found that the number of chromosomes in a given species is constant. With genetic continuity confirmed and the finding by [[Eduard Adolf Strasburger|Eduard Strasburger]] that the nuclei of reproductive cells (in pollen and embryo) have a reducing division (halving of chromosomes, now known as [[meiosis]]) the field of heredity was opened up. By 1926 [[Thomas Hunt Morgan|Thomas Morgan]] was able to outline a theory of the [[gene]] and its structure and function. The form and function of plastids received similar attention, the association with starch being noted at an early date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|pp=154–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; With observation of the cellular structure of all organisms and the process of cell division and continuity of genetic material, the analysis of the structure of protoplasm and the cell wall as well as that of [[plastid]]s and [[vacuole]]s – what is now known as [[cell biology|cytology]], or [[cell theory]] became firmly established.

Later, the cytological basis of the gene-chromosome theory of [[heredity]] extended from about 1900–1944 and was initiated by the rediscovery of [[Gregor Johann Mendel|Gregor Mendel]]'s (1822–1884) laws of plant heredity first published in 1866 in ''Experiments on Plant Hybridization'' and based on cultivated pea, ''Pisum sativum'': this heralded the opening up of plant genetics. The cytological basis for gene-chromosome theory was explored through the role of [[polyploidy]] and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] in [[speciation]] and it was becoming better understood that interbreeding populations were the unit of adaptive change in biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental morphology and evolution===
{{Main article|Evolution}}
Until the 1860s it was believed that species had remained unchanged through time: each biological form was the result of an independent act of creation and therefore absolutely distinct and immutable. But the hard reality of geological formations and strange fossils needed scientific explanation. [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[Origin of Species]]'' (1859) replaced the assumption of constancy with the theory of descent with modification. [[Phylogeny]] became a new principle as "natural" classifications became classifications reflecting, not just similarities, but evolutionary relationships. [[Wilhelm Hofmeister]] established that there was a similar pattern of organization in all plants expressed through the [[alternation of generations]] and extensive [[homology (biology)|homology]] of structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reynolds Green|1909|pp=7–10, 501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polymath]] German intellect [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Johann Goethe]] (1749–1832) had interests and influence that extended into botany. In ''{{lang|de|Die Metamorphose der Pflanzen}}'' (1790) he provided a theory of plant morphology (he coined the word "morphology") and he included within his concept of "metamorphosis" modification during evolution, thus linking comparative morphology with phylogeny. Though the botanical basis of his work has been challenged there is no doubt that he prompted discussion and research on the origin and function of floral parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=343–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory probably stimulated the opposing views of German botanists [[Alexander Braun]] (1805–1877) and Matthias Schleiden who applied the experimental method to the principles of growth and form that were later extended by [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|Augustin de Candolle]] (1778–1841).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=371–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon fixation (photosynthesis)===
{{further|Soil plant atmosphere continuum|Photosynthesis}}
[[File:Simple photosynthesis overview.svg|thumb|right|150px|&lt;center&gt;Photosynthesis splits water to liberate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and fixes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into sugar&lt;/center&gt;]]
At the start of the 19th century the idea that plants could synthesise almost all their tissues from atmospheric gases had not yet emerged. The energy component of photosynthesis, the capture and storage of the Sun's radiant energy in carbon bonds (a process on which all life depends) was first elucidated in 1847 by [[Julius Robert von Mayer|Mayer]], but the details of how this was done would take many more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chlorophyll was named in 1818 and its chemistry gradually determined, to be finally resolved in the early 20th century. The mechanism of photosynthesis remained a mystery until the mid-19th century when Sachs, in 1862, noted that starch was formed in green cells only in the presence of light and in 1882 he confirmed carbohydrates as the starting point for all other organic compounds in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection between the pigment chlorophyll and starch production was finally made in 1864 but tracing the precise biochemical pathway of starch formation did not begin until about 1915.

===Nitrogen fixation===
{{Main article|Nitrogen fixation}}
Significant discoveries relating to nitrogen assimilation and metabolism, including [[ammonification]], [[nitrification]] and [[nitrogen fixation]] (the uptake of atmospheric nitrogen by [[symbiotic]] soil microorganisms) had to wait for advances in chemistry and bacteriology in the late 19th century and this was followed in the early 20th century by the elucidation of [[protein]] and [[amino-acid]] synthesis and their role in plant metabolism. With this knowledge it was then possible to outline the global [[nitrogen cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reed|1942|pp=214–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century==
[[File:Chromatography of chlorophyll - Step 7.jpg|right|thumb|80px|&lt;center&gt;Thin layer chromatography is used to separate components of [[chlorophyll]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
20th century science grew out of the solid foundations laid by the breadth of vision and detailed experimental observations of the 19th century. A vastly increased research force was now rapidly extending the horizons of botanical knowledge at all levels of plant organization from molecules to global plant ecology. There was now an awareness of the unity of biological structure and function at the cellular and biochemical levels of organisation. Botanical advance was closely associated with advances in physics and chemistry with the greatest advances in the 20th century mainly relating to the penetration of molecular organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the level of plant communities it would take until mid century to consolidate work on ecology and [[population genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1910 experiments using labelled [[isotope]]s were being used to elucidate plant biochemical pathways, to open the line of research leading to gene technology. On a more practical level research funding was now becoming available from agriculture and industry.

===Molecules===
{{Main article|Molecular biology}}
In 1903 [[Chlorophyll]]s a and b were separated by thin layer [[chromatography]] then, through the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists, notably [[Hans Adolf Krebs|Hans Krebs]] (1900–1981) and [[Carl Cori|Carl]] (1896–1984) and [[Gerty Cori]] (1896–1957) began tracing out the central metabolic pathways of life. Between the 1930s and 1950s it was determined that [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], located in [[mitochondria]], was the source of cellular chemical energy and the constituent reactions of [[photosynthesis]] were progressively revealed. Then, in 1944 [[DNA]] was extracted for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these revelations there was the discovery of plant hormones or "growth substances", notably [[auxin]]s, (1934) [[gibberellin]]s (1934) and [[cytokinin]]s (1964)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effects of [[photoperiodism]], the control of plant processes, especially flowering, by the relative lengths of day and night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the establishment of Mendel's laws, the gene-chromosome theory of heredity was confirmed by the work of [[August Weismann]] who identified chromosomes as the hereditary material. Also, in observing the halving of the chromosome number in germ cells he anticipated work to follow on the details of [[meiosis]], the complex process of redistribution of hereditary material that occurs in the germ cells. In the 1920s and 1930s [[population genetics]] combined the theory of evolution with [[Mendelian genetics]] to produce the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]. By the mid-1960s the molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction was firmly established through the new discipline of [[molecular biology]]. [[Genetic engineering]], the insertion of genes into a host cell for cloning, began in the 1970s with the invention of [[recombinant DNA]] techniques and its commercial applications applied to agricultural crops followed in the 1990s. There was now the potential to identify organisms by molecular "[[DNA fingerprinting|fingerprinting]]" and to estimate the times in the past when critical evolutionary changes had occurred through the use of "[[molecular clock]]s".

===Computers, electron microscopes and evolution===
{{further|Ultrastructure|Palynology}}
[[File:Ernst Ruska Electron Microscope - Deutsches Museum - Munich-edit.jpg|thumb|right|125px|&lt;center&gt;Electron microscope constructed by [[Ernst Ruska]] in 1933&lt;/center&gt;]]
Increased experimental precision combined with vastly improved scientific instrumentation was opening up exciting new fields. In 1936 [[Alexander Oparin]] (1894–1980) demonstrated a possible mechanism for the synthesis of organic matter from inorganic molecules. In the 1960s it was determined that the Earth's earliest life-forms treated as plants, the [[cyanobacteria]] known as [[stromatolite]]s, dated back some 3.5 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mid-century transmission and scanning electron microscopy presented another level of resolution to the structure of matter, taking anatomy into the new world of "[[ultrastructure]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New and revised "phylogenetic" classification systems of the plant kingdom were produced, perhaps the most notable being that of [[August W. Eichler|August Eichler]] (1839–1887), and the massive 23 volume ''{{lang|de|Die natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien}}'' of [[Adolf Engler]] (1844–1930) &amp; [[Karl Anton Eugen Prantl|Karl Prantl]] (1849–1893) published over the period 1887 and 1915. [[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomy]] based on gross morphology was now being supplemented by using characters revealed by [[palynology|pollen morphology]], [[embryology]], [[anatomy]], [[cell biology|cytology]], [[serology]], [[macromolecule]]s and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of computers facilitated the rapid analysis of large data sets used for [[numerical taxonomy]] (also called [[taximetrics]] or [[phenetics]]). The emphasis on truly natural phylogenies spawned the disciplines of [[cladistics]] and [[phylogenetic systematics]]. The grand taxonomic synthesis ''An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants'' (1981) of American [[Arthur Cronquist]] (1919–1992) was superseded when, in 1998, the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] published a [[phylogeny]] of flowering plants based on the analysis of [[DNA]] sequences using the techniques of the new [[molecular systematics]] which was resolving questions concerning the earliest evolutionary branches of the [[angiosperms]] (flowering plants). The exact relationship of fungi to plants had for some time been uncertain. Several lines of evidence pointed to fungi being different from plants, animals and bacteria – indeed, more closely related to animals than plants. In the 1980s-90s molecular analysis revealed an evolutionary divergence of fungi from other organisms about 1 billion years ago – sufficient reason to erect a unique kingdom separate from plants.{{sfn|Bruns|2006}}

===Biogeography and ecology===
{{Main article|Biogeography}}
[[File:Vegetation-no-legend.PNG|thumb|350px|left|&lt;center&gt;Map of terrestrial [[biomes]] classified by vegetation type&lt;/center&gt;]]
The publication of [[Alfred Wegener]]'s (1880–1930) theory of [[continental drift]] 1912 gave additional impetus to comparative physiology and the study of [[biogeography]] while ecology in the 1930s contributed the important ideas of plant community, [[Ecological succession|succession]], community change, and energy flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1940 to 1950 ecology matured to become an independent discipline as [[Eugene P. Odum|Eugene Odum]] (1913–2002) formulated many of the concepts of [[ecosystem ecology]], emphasising relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) as key factors in the field. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, [[Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov|Nikolai Vavilov]] (1887–1943) from 1914 to 1940 produced accounts of the geography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.{{sfn|de Candolle|1885}}

==Twenty-first century==
In reviewing the sweep of botanical history it is evident that, through the power of the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of [[resource management]], [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]], [[food security|human food security]], [[introduced species|biologically invasive organisms]], [[carbon sequestration]], [[climate change]], and [[sustainability]].{{sfn|BSA|2015}}

An '''institute of technology''' (also: '''university of technology''', '''polytechnic university''', '''technikon''' and '''technical university''') is a type of [[university]] which specializes in [[engineering]], [[technology]], [[applied science]] and sometimes [[natural science]]s.  

The English term '''polytechnic''' appeared in the early 19th century, from the French ''[[École Polytechnique]]'', an engineering school founded in 1794 in [[Paris]]. The [[French language|French]] term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''πολύ'' (''polú'' or ''polý'') meaning "many" and ''τεχνικός'' (''tekhnikós'') meaning "arts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=polytechnic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutes of technology versus polytechnics==
The institutes of technology and polytechnics have been in existence since at least the 18th century, but became popular after [[World War II]] with the expansion of engineering and applied science education, associated with the new needs created by [[industrialization]]. The world's first institution of technology, the Berg-Schola (today its legal successor is the [[University of Miskolc]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uni-miskolc.hu/uni/univ/booklet/MandU.html | title = Misckolc and the University | date = | publisher = Miskolci Egyetem (University of Miskolci) | access-date = 29 October 2017}}{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was founded by the Court Chamber of Vienna in [[Selmecbánya]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now [[Banská Štiavnica]], [[Slovakia]]), in 1735 in order to train specialists of precious metal and copper mining according to the requirements of the industrial revolution in Hungary. The oldest German Institute of Technology is the [[Braunschweig University of Technology]], founded in 1745 as "Collegium Carolinum". Another exception is the ''[[École Polytechnique]]'', which has educated [[France|French]] ''élites'' since its foundation in 1794. In some cases, polytechnics or institutes of technology are engineering schools or technical colleges.

In several countries, like Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey, institutes of technology and polytechnics are institutions of [[higher education]] and have been accredited to award academic degrees and doctorates. Famous examples are the [[Istanbul Technical University]], [[ETH Zurich]], [[İYTE]], [[Delft University of Technology]] and [[RWTH Aachen]], all considered universities.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In countries like Iran, Finland, Malaysia, Portugal, Singapore or the United Kingdom, there is often a significant and confused distinction between polytechnics and universities. In the UK a binary system of higher education emerged consisting of universities (research orientation) and polytechnics (engineering and applied science and professional practice orientation).  Polytechnics offered university equivalent degrees mainly in [[Science, technology, engineering and mathematics|STEM]] subjects from [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[master's]] and [[PhD]] that were validated and governed at the national level by the independent UK [[Council for National Academic Awards]]. In 1992 UK polytechnics were designated as universities which meant they could award their own degrees. The CNAA was disbanded. The UK's first polytechnic, the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now the [[University of Westminster]]), was founded in 1838 in Regent Street, London. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] the term "institute of technology" is the more favored synonym of a "[[regional technical college]]" though the latter is the legally correct term; however, [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] is a university in all but name as it can confer degrees in accordance with law, [[Cork Institute of Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.hetac.ie/docs/Cork%20IT-DA%20Evaluation%20Group%20Report.pdf | title = Report of the Delegated Authority Evaluation Group on the Cork Institute of Technology | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912200434/http://www.hetac.ie/docs/Cork%20IT-DA%20Evaluation%20Group%20Report.pdf | archive-date=September 12, 2008 | format = PDF | date = June 2005 | author = Evaluation Group for the Delegation of Authority to Make Awards | publisher = Higher Education and Training Awards Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other Institutes of Technology have delegated authority from HETAC to make awards to and including master's degree level — Level 9 of the Republic of Ireland's National Framework for Qualifications (NFQ) — for all areas of study and Doctorate level in a number of others.

In a number of countries, although being today generally considered similar institutions of higher learning across many countries, polytechnics and institutes of technology used to have a quite different statute among each other, its teaching competences and organizational history.  In many cases "polytechnic" were elite technological universities concentrating on applied science and engineering and may also be a former designation for a vocational institution, before it has been granted the exclusive right to award academic degrees and can be truly called an "institute of technology". A number of polytechnics providing higher education is simply a result of a formal upgrading from their original and historical role as intermediate technical education schools. In some situations, former polytechnics or other non-university institutions have emerged solely through an administrative change of statutes, which often included a name change with the introduction of new designations like "institute of technology", "polytechnic university", "[[university of applied sciences]]", or "university of technology" for marketing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Argentina===
{{See also|Education in Argentina|List of universities in Argentina}}

In the so-called ''[[Latin American docta]]'' the main higher institution advocates to the study of technology is the [[National Technological University]] which has brand ramifications through all the country geographic space in the way of ''Regional Faculties''. The [[Buenos Aires Institute of Technology]] (ITBA) is other important recognized institute of technology with renowned and prestige in the country.

===Australia===
{{See also|Education in Australia|Technical and Further Education|College of Advanced Education|Category:Australian tertiary institutions}}

;1970s–1990s
During the 1970s to early 1990s, the term was used to describe state owned and funded technical schools that offered both [[vocational education|vocational]] and higher education. They were part of the [[College of advanced education|College of Advanced Education]] system. In the 1990s most of these merged with existing universities, or formed new ones of their own. These new universities often took the title University of Technology, for marketing rather than legal purposes. AVCC report The most prominent such university in each state founded the [[Australian Technology Network]] a few years later.

;1990s–today
Since the mid-1990s, the term has been applied to some technically minded [[technical and further education]] (TAFE) institutes. A recent example is the [[Melbourne Polytechnic]]  rebranding and repositioning in 2014 from Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE.&lt;ref&gt;Kylie Adoranti, Herald Sun, 3 October 2014 ''[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/news/northern-melbourne-institute-of-tafe-to-be-rebranded-as-melbourne-polytechnic/story-fnglekhp-1227078125350 Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE to be rebranded as Melbourne Polytechnic]'', Retrieved 2 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; These primarily offer [[vocational education]], although some like Melbourne Polytechnic are expanding into higher education offering vocationally oriented applied bachelor degrees. This usage of the term is most prevalent historically in NSW and the ACT. The new terminology is apt given that this category of institution are becoming very much like the institutes of the 1970s–1990s period.

In Tasmania in 2009 the old college system and TAFE Tasmania have started a 3-year restructure to become the Tasmanian Polytechnic www.polytechnic.tas.edu.au, Tasmanian Skills Institute www.skillsinstitute.tas.edu.au and Tasmanian Academy www.academy.tas.edu.au

In the higher education sector, there are seven designated Universities of Technology in Australia (though, note, not all use the phrase "university of technology", such as the Universities of Canberra and South Australia, which used to be Colleges of Advanced Education before transitioning into fully-fledged universities with the ability - most important of all - to confer doctorates):
* [[Curtin University]], [[Western Australia]]
* [[Queensland University of Technology]], [[Queensland]]
* [[RMIT University|Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]
* [[Swinburne University of Technology]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]
* [[University of Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]]
* [[University of South Australia]], [[South Australia]]
* [[University of Technology, Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]

* [[Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt]] (Faculty of Technical Sciences founded 2007)


;Fachhochschulen
'''[[Fachhochschule]]''' is a German type of tertiary education institution and adopted later in Austria and Switzerland. They do not focus exclusively on technology, but may also offer courses in social science, medicine, business and design. They grant bachelor's degrees and master's degrees and focus more on teaching than research and more on specific professions than on science.

In 2010, there were 20 Fachhochschulen in Austria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mokka Medienagentur GmbH |url=http://www.bmwf.gv.at/startseite/hochschulen/fachhochschulen/ |title=Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft und Forschung: Fachhochschulen |publisher=Bmwf.gv.at |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119223842/http://www.bmwf.gv.at/startseite/hochschulen/fachhochschulen/ |archivedate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium and the Netherlands===
''Hogeschool'' is used in [[Belgium]] and in the [[Netherlands]]. The hogeschool has many similarities to the ''Fachhochschule'' in the German language areas and to the ''ammattikorkeakoulu'' in Finland.

''Hogeschool'' institutions in the [[Flemish Community]] of Belgium (such as the [[Erasmus Hogeschool Brussel]]) are currently undergoing a process of academization. They form associations with a university and integrate research into the curriculum, which will allow them to deliver academic master's degrees. &lt;!-- Don't the Walloon universities do the same?--&gt;

In the Netherlands, four former institutes of technology have become universities over the past decades. These are the current three Technical Universities (at [[Delft University of Technology|Delft]], [[Eindhoven University of Technology|Eindhoven]] and [[Universiteit Twente|Enschede]]), plus the former agricultural institute in [[Wageningen University|Wageningen]]. A list of all ''hogescholen'' in the Netherlands, including some which might be called polytechnics, can be found [[List of universities in the Netherlands#Vocational universities|here]].

===Canada===
In Canada, there are affiliate schools, colleges, institutes of technology/polytechnic institutes and universities that offer instruction in a variety of programs that can lead to engineering and applied science degrees, apprenticeship and trade programs, certificates and diplomas. Affiliate schools are polytechnic divisions belonging to a national university and offer select technical and engineering programs. Colleges, institutes of technology/polytechnic institutes and universities tend to be independent institutions.

Credentials are typically conferred at the undergraduate level; however, university-affiliated schools like the École de technologie supérieure and the École Polytechnique de Montréal (both of which are located in Quebec), also offer graduate and postgraduate programs, in accordance with provincial higher education guidelines. Canadian higher education institutions, at all levels, undertake directed and applied research with financing allocated through public funding, private equity, or industry sources.

Some of Canada's most esteemed colleges and polytechnic institutions also partake in collaborative institute-industry projects, leading to technology commercialization, made possible through the scope of [[Polytechnics Canada]], a national alliance of eleven leading research-intensive colleges and institutes of technology.

;Affiliate schools

===Finland===
;Universities of technology
Universities of technology are categorised as universities, are allowed to grant B.Sc. (Tech.), [[Diplomi-insinööri|M.Sc. (Tech.)]], Lic.Sc. (Tech.), Ph.D. and D.Sc. (Tech.) degrees and roughly correspond to Instituts de technologie of French-speaking areas and Technische Universität of Germany in prestige. In addition to universities of technology, some universities, e.g. University of Oulu and Åbo Akademi University, are allowed to grant the B.Sc. (tech.), M.Sc. (tech.) and D.Sc. (Tech.) degrees.

Universities of technology are academically similar to other (non-polytechnic) universities. Prior to Bologna process, M.Sc. (Tech.) required 180 credits, whereas M.Sc. from a normal university required 160 credits. The credits between universities of technology and normal universities are comparable.

Some Finnish universities of technology are:
*[[Aalto University]], formed from [[Helsinki University of Technology]] and other universities
*[[Lappeenranta University of Technology]]
*[[Tampere University of Technology]]

;Polytechnics
Polytechnic schools are distinct from academic universities in Finland. ''[[Ammattikorkeakoulu]]'' is the common term in [[Finland]], as is the Swedish alternative "''yrkeshögskola''" – their focus is on studies leading to a degree (for instance ''insinööri'', engineer; in international use, Bachelor of Engineering) in kind different from but in level comparable to an academic bachelor's degree awarded by a university. Since 2006 the polytechnics have offered studies leading to master's degrees (Master of Engineering).  After January 1, 2006, some Finnish ammattikorkeakoulus switched the English term "polytechnic" to the term "university of applied sciences" in the English translations of their legal names. The ammattikorkeakoulu has many similarities to the ''hogeschool'' in Belgium and in the Netherlands and to the ''Fachhochschule'' in the German language areas.

Some recognized Finnish polytechnics are:
*[[Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Lapland University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Tampere University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Turku University of Applied Sciences]]

A complete list may be found in [[List of polytechnics in Finland]].

===France and Francophone regions===

;Instituts de technologie (grandes écoles)
[[Collegiate university|Collegiate universities]] grouping several engineering schools or multi-site clusters of French [[grandes écoles]] provide sciences and technology curricula as autonomous higher education engineering institutes. They include:
* [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech]]
* [[Centrale Graduate School]]
* [[Grenoble Institute of Technology]]
* [[Institut national des sciences appliquées]]
* [[Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace]]
* [[Paris Institute of Technology]]
* [[ESTIA Institute of Technology]]
They provide science and technology master's degrees and doctoral degrees.

;'Universités technologiques / instituts universitaires de technologie'' / polytechs
French education system also includes three universities of technology:
*''[[Université de technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard]]''
*[[University of Technology of Compiègne]]
*[[University of Technology of Troyes]]

In addition, France's education system includes many institutes of technology, embedded within most French universities. They are referred-to as ''institut universitaire de technologie'' (IUT). Instituts universitaires de technologie provide undergraduate technology curricula. 'Polytech institutes', embedded as a part of eleven French universities provide both undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula.

In the French-speaking part of Switzerland exists also the term ''haute école specialisée'' for a type of institution called ''Fachhochschule'' in the German-speaking part of the country. (see below).

;Écoles polytechniques
Higher education systems, that are influenced by the French education system set at the end of the 18th century, use a terminology derived by reference to the French ''[[École polytechnique]]''. Such terms include ''Écoles Polytechniques'' (Algeria, Belgium, Canada, France, Switzerland, Tunisia), Escola Politécnica (Brasil, Spain), Polytechnicum (Eastern Europe).

In [[French language]], higher education refers to ''écoles polytechniques'', providing science and engineering curricula:
* [[École polytechnique]] or '''X''' (near [[Paris]])
* École polytechnique de Bruxelles
* [[École polytechnique de Montréal]]
* [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]]
*[[National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine]]
*[[National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse]]

===Germany===
;Fachhochschule{{Main|Fachhochschule}}

''Fachhochschulen'' were first founded in the early 1970s. They do not focus exclusively on technology, but may also offer courses in social science, medicine, business and design. They grant bachelor's degrees and master's degrees and focus more on teaching than research and more on specific professions than on science.

In 2009/10, there existed about 200 ''Fachhochschulen'' in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Content/Statistiken/BildungForschungKultur/Hochschulen/AktuellZusatz,templateId=renderPrint.psml#Fussnote1|title=Startseite&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis)|work=destatis.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[:de:Liste der Fachhochschulen in Deutschland|German Wikipedia]] for a list.

;Technische Universität
''[[Technische Universität]]'' (abbreviation: ''TU'') is the common term for universities of technology or technical university. These institutions can grant habilitation and doctoral degrees and focus on research.

The nine largest and most renowned ''Technische Universitäten'' in Germany have formed [[TU9|TU9 German Institutes of Technology]] as community of interests. Technische Universitäten normally have faculties or departements of natural sciences and often of economics but can also have units of cultural and social sciences and arts. RWTH Aachen, TU Dresden and TU München also have a faculty of medicine associated with [[Teaching hospital|university hospitals]] ([[Klinikum Aachen]], [[University Hospital Dresden]], [[Rechts der Isar Hospital]]).

There are 17 universities of technology in Germany with about 290,000 students enrolled. The four states of [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]] are not operating a ''Technische Universität''. [[Saxony]] and [[Lower Saxony]] have the highest counts of ''TUs'', while in Saxony three out of four universities are universities of technology.

===Ireland===
{{see |Institutes of technology in Ireland}}
An "Institute of Technology" was formerly referred to as Regional Technical College (RTCs) system. The abbreviation '''IT''' is now widely used to refer to an Institute of Technology. These institutions offer sub-degree, degree and post-graduate level studies. Unlike the Irish university system an Institute of Technology also offers sub-degree programmes such as 2-year [[Higher Certificate]] programme in various academic fields of study. Some institutions have "delegated authority" that allows them to make awards in their own name, after authorisation by the [[Higher Education &amp; Training Awards Council]].

[[Dublin Institute of Technology]] developed separately from the Regional Technical College system and after several decades of association with the [[University of Dublin, Trinity College]] it acquired the authority to confer its own degrees before becoming a member of the T.U. Dublin.

The IOTI, is the representative body for the various Institutes of Technology in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ioti.ie/ Institutes of Technology Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;

;Technical University
There are 4 technical universities in Malaysia and all are belongs to [[Malaysian Technical University Network]]: 
*[[Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia]]
*[[Universiti Malaysia Perlis]]
*[[Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka]]
*[[Universiti Malaysia Pahang]]

===Mauritius===
The only technical university in [[Mauritius]] is the [[University of Technology, Mauritius]] with its main campus situated in La Tour Koenig, Pointe aux Sables. It has a specialized mission with a technology focus. It applies traditional and beyond traditional approaches to teaching, training, research and consultancy. The university has been founded with the aim to play a key role in the economic and social development of Mauritius through the development of programmes of direct relevance to the country’s needs, for example in areas like technology, sustainable development science and public sector policy and management.

===Moldova===
{{See also|Education in Moldova}}

* [[Technical University of Moldova]], 1964

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Public sector organisations in New Zealand#Polytechnics and institutes of technology|Education in New Zealand}}

[[New Zealand]] polytechnics are established under the Education Act 1989 as amended and are typically considered state-owned tertiary institutions along with [[university|universities]], colleges of education and [[wananga|wānanga]]; there is today often much crossover in courses and qualifications offered between all these types of [[Tertiary Education Institution]]s. Some have officially taken the title 'institute of technology' which is a term recognized in government strategies equal to that of the term 'polytechnic'.  One has opted for the name '[[Universal College of Learning]]' (UCOL) and another '[[Unitec New Zealand]]'. These are legal names but not recognized terms like 'polytechnic' or 'institute of technology'.  Many if not all now grant at least bachelor-level degrees. Some colleges of education or institutes of technology are privately owned, however, the qualification levels vary widely.

Since the 1990s, there has been consolidation in New Zealand's state-owned tertiary education system. In the polytechnic sector: Wellington Polytechnic amalgamated with [[Massey University]]. The Central Institute of Technology explored a merger with the [[Waikato Institute of Technology]], which was abandoned, but later, after financial concerns, controversially amalgamated with Hutt Valley Polytechnic, which in turn became [[Wellington Institute of Technology]]. Some smaller polytechnics in the [[North Island]], such as Waiarapa Polytechnic, amalgamated with [[Universal College of Learning|UCOL]]. (The only other amalgamations have been in the colleges of education.)

The [[Auckland University of Technology]] is the only polytechnic to have been elevated to [[university]] status; while [[Unitec New Zealand|Unitec]] has had repeated attempts blocked by government policy and consequent decisions; Unitec has not been able to convince the courts to overturn these decisions.

===Nigeria===
{{See also|List of polytechnics in Nigeria}}
Virtually every state in [[Nigeria]] has a polytechnic university operated by either the federal or state government. In [[Rivers State]] for example, there are two state-owned polytechnic universities; [[Kenule Beeson Saro-Wiwa Polytechnic]], [[Bori City]] and the [[Rivers State College of Arts and Science]], [[Port Harcourt]]. The former was established on 13 May 1988 while the latter–though founded in 1984–was approved by the [[National Board for Technical Education|NBTE]] in 2006. The first private polytechnic university in the state is the [[Eastern Polytechnic, Port Harcourt|Eastern Polytechnic]], established in 2008.

===Pakistan===

The polytechnic institutes in [[Pakistan]] offer [[diploma]] spanning three years in different engineering branches. This diploma is known as [[Diploma of Associate Engineering]] (DAE). Students are admitted to the diploma program based on their results in the 10th grade standardized exams. The main purpose of the diploma offered in polytechnic institutes is to train people in various trades.

These institutes are located throughout Pakistan and have been in service since early 1950s.

After successfully completion of diploma at a polytechnic, students can get employment or enroll either in [[Bachelor of Technology]] (B.Tech) or [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (BE) degree programs.

===Poland===
'''Politechnika''' (translated as a "technical university" or "university of technology") is the designation of a technical university in Poland. Here are some of the larger Polytechnics in Poland:
*[[Politechnika Śląska]]
*[[Politechnika Wrocławska]]
*[[Politechnika Warszawska]]
*[[Poznań University of Technology|Politechnika Poznańska]]
*[[Politechnika Krakowska]]

*[[West Pomeranian University of Technology|Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny]]

===Portugal===
{{Main|Polytechnic (Portugal)}}
The designation "Institute of Technology" is not applied at all, being meaningless in [[Portugal]]. However, there are a number of non-university [[list of higher education institutions in Portugal|higher educational institutions]] which are called [[Polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic institutes]] since the 1970s. Some of these institutions existed since the 19th century with different designations (industrial and commercial institutes, agricultural managers, elementary teachers and nurses schools, etc.). In theory, the polytechnics higher education system is aimed to provide a more practical training and be profession-oriented, while the university higher education system is aimed to have a stronger theoretical basis and be highly research-oriented. The polytechnics are also oriented to provide shorter length studies aimed to respond to local needs. The Portuguese polytechnics can then be compared to the US [[community colleges]].

Since the implementation of [[Bologna Process]] in Portugal in 2007, the polytechnics offer the 1st cycle (licentiate degree) and 2nd cycle (master's degree) of higher studies. Until 1998, the polytechnics only awarded bachelor ({{lang-pt|bacharelato}}) degrees (three-year short-cycle degrees) and were not authorized to award higher degrees. They however granted post-bachelor diplomas in specialized higher studies (DESE, ''diploma de estudos superiores especializados''), that could be obtained after the conclusion of a two-year second cycle of studies and were academical equivalent to the university's [[licentiate degree]]s (''licenciatura''). After 1998, they started to be allowed to confer their own licentiate degrees, which replaced the DESE diplomas.

The Polytechnics in Singapore do not offer bachelors, masters or PhD degrees. However, the Polytechnics in Singapore offers three-year diploma courses in fields such as information technology, engineering subjects and other vocational fields, like psychology and nursing. The Polytechnic diploma certification in Singapore is equivalent to a [[junior college]] in the UK or a [[community college]] in the United States. There are 5 polytechnics in Singapore. They are namely: [[Singapore Polytechnic]], [[Ngee Ann Polytechnic]], [[Temasek Polytechnic]], [[Nanyang Polytechnic]] and [[Republic Polytechnic]].

A Polytechnic diploma in Singapore is known to be parallel and sometimes equivalent to the first years at a bachelor's degree-granting institution, thus, Polytechnic graduates in Singapore have the privilege of being granted transfer credits or module exemptions when they apply to local and overseas universities, depending on the university's policies on transfer credits.

The only university in Singapore with the term "institute of technology", most notably the [[Singapore Institute of Technology]] were developed in 2009 as an option for Polytechnic Diploma graduates who desire to pursue a bachelor's degree. Other technological university in Singapore includes the [[Nanyang Technological University]] (1981) and the [[Singapore University of Technology and Design]] (2009).

has completed a process of transforming its "higher education landscape". Historically a division has existed in South Africa between Universities and Technikons (polytechnics) as well between institutions servicing particular racial and language groupings. In 1993 Technikons were afforded the power to award [[Bachelor of Technology#South Africa|certain technology degrees]].
Beginning in 2004 former Technikons have either been merged with traditional Universities to form Comprehensive Universities or have become Universities of Technology, however the Universities of Technology have not to date acquired all of the traditional rights and privileges of a University (such as the ability to confer a wide range of degrees).&lt;ref&gt;Mentz, J., Kotzé, P., Van der Merwe, A.

Most of Thailand's institutes of technology were developed from [[technical college]]s, in the past could not grant bachelor's degrees; today, however, they are [[university]] level institutions, some of which can grant degrees to the [[doctorate|doctoral]] level. Examples are [[Pathumwan Institute of Technology]] (developed from Pathumwan Technical School), [[King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang]] (Nondhaburi Telecommunications Training Centre) and [[King Mongkut's Institute of Technology North Bangkok]] (Thai-German Technical School).

There are two former institutes of technology, which already changed their name to "University of Technology": [[Rajamangala University of Technology]] (formerly Institute of Technology and Vocational Education) and [[King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi]] (Thonburi Technology Institute).

Institutes of technology with different origins are [[Asian Institute of Technology]], which developed from [[SEATO]] Graduate School of Engineering and [[Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology]], an engineering school of [[Thammasat University]]. [[Suranaree University of Technology]] is the only government-owned technological university in Thailand that was established (1989) as such; while [[Mahanakorn University of Technology]] is the most well known private technological institute.

===United Kingdom===
'''Polytechnics'''{{Main|Polytechnic (United Kingdom)}}

Polytechnics were [[tertiary education]] teaching institutions in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. The comparable institutions in [[Scotland]] were collectively referred to as [[Central Institution]]s.

From 1965 to 1992, UK polytechnics operated under the [[Binary Divide|binary system]] of education along with universities.  Polytechnics offered diplomas and degrees (bachelor's, master's, PhD) validated at the national level by the [[Council for National Academic Awards]] (CNAA). They particularly excelled in engineering and applied science degree courses and other [[science, technology, engineering and mathematics|STEM]] subjects similar to technological universities in the USA and continental Europe.  Polytechnics were associated with innovations including [[women’s studies]], the academic study of [[communication studies|communications]] and [[media studies|media]], [[sandwich degree]]s and the rise of management and [[business studies]]. 

Britain's first polytechnic, the [[Royal Polytechnic Institution]] later known as the [[Polytechnic of Central London]] (now the [[University of Westminster]]) was established in 1838 at Regent Street in London and its goal was to educate and popularize engineering and scientific knowledge and inventions in Victorian Britain "at little expense."  The London Polytechnic led a mass movement to create numerous polytechnic institutes across the UK in the late 19th century.  Most polytechnic institutes were established at the centre of major metropolitan cities and their focus was on engineering, applied science and technology education.

The designation "institute of technology" was occasionally used by polytechnics (Bolton), [[Central Institution]]s (Dundee, Robert Gordon's) and postgraduate universities, (Cranfield and Wessex), most of which later adopted the designation university and there were two "institutes of science and technology": [[UMIST]] and UWIST, part of the [[University of Wales]]. [[Loughborough University]] was called Loughborough University of Technology from 1966 to 1996, the only institution in the UK to have had such a designation.

Polytechnics were granted university status under the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]].  This meant that polytechnics could confer degrees without the oversight of the national CNAA organization.  These institutions are sometimes referred to as [[New universities (United Kingdom)#Post-1992 universities that trace their roots to former polytechnics|post-1992 universities]].

'''Technical colleges'''

In 1956, some colleges of technology received the designation [[college of advanced technology (United Kingdom)|college of advanced technology]]. They became universities in 1966 meaning they could award their own degrees. 

Institutions called "technical institutes" or "technical schools" that were formed in the early 20th century provided further education between high school and university or polytechnic.  Most technical institutes have been merged into regional colleges and some have been designated university colleges if they are associated with a local university.

In 2016 the UK government announced plans to establish new "institutes of technology" in England as part of its reforms to post-16 skills provision "to provide technical education in STEM subjects at levels 3, 4 and 5. Each IoT is likely to build on infrastructure that already exists but will have its own independent identity, governance arrangements which directly involve employers and national branding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/536068/56259_Cm_9280_print.pdf |title=Data |website=www.gov.uk |format=PDF}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Institute of Technology (United States)}}
[[Image:Teamsolvingpuzzle.jpg|thumb|Students from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]]]
Polytechnic institutes in the USA are technological universities, many dating back to the mid-19th century.  A handful of American universities include the phrases "Institute of Technology", "Polytechnic Institute", "Polytechnic University", or similar phrasing in their names; these are generally [[research]]-intensive universities with a focus on engineering, science and technology. The earliest of these institutions include: [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI, 1824), [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT, 1829), [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering|Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute]] (1854), [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]  (MIT, 1861), [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] (1865), [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] (1870), [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] (VPI or VT, 1872), [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (1881), [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (1885), [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech, 1891), [[Drexel University|Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry]] (1891) and [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (1900). Conversely, schools dubbed "technical colleges" or "technical institutes" generally provide post-secondary training in technical and mechanical fields, focusing on training vocational skills primarily at a [[community college]] level, parallel and sometimes equivalent to the first two years at a bachelor's degree-granting institution.

===Venezuela===
Institutes of technology in Venezuela were developed in the 1950s as an option for post-secondary education in technical and scientific courses, after the ''polytechnic'' French concepts.  At that time, technical education was considered essential for the development of a sound [[middle class]] economy.

Nowadays, most of the ''Institutos de Tecnología'' are privately run businesses, with varying degrees of quality.

Most of these institutes award diplomas after three or three and a half years of education. The institute of technology implementation (IUT, from ''Instituto universitario de tecnologia'' in Spanish) began with the creation of the first IUT at Caracas, the capital city of Venezuela, called IUT. Dr. Federico Rivero Palacio adopted the French "Institut Universitaire de Technologie"s system, using French personnel and study system based on three-year periods, with research and engineering facilities at the same level as the main national universities to obtain French equivalent degrees. This IUT is the first and only one in Venezuela having French equivalent degrees accepted, implementing this system and observing the high-level degrees some other IUTs were created in 
Venezuela, regardless of this the term IUT was not used appropriately resulting in some institutions with mediocre quality and no equivalent degree in France. Later, some private institutions sprang up using IUT in their names, but they are not regulated by the original French system and award lower quality degrees.

'''Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biológicos (INRB)''' is the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] state-run institute for research on [[biological resource]]s. It develops research in agricultural fields, [[veterinary]], animal growth, [[marine biology]] and fishing. It provides scientific and technical support to its related sectors of activity.

==History==
The National Agronomy and Fishing Investigation Institute (native official name: Instituto Nacional de Investigação Agrária e das Pescas) was its previous incarnation. In 2006, a decree (''Decreto-Lei n.º 209/2006'') created the Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biológicos from the remains of the ''Instituto Nacional de Investigação Agrária'' (agricultural research), ''Instituto de Investigação das Pescas e do Mar'' (fishing and marine resources research) and the ''Laboratório Nacional de Investigação Veterinária'' (veterinary research).

A '''lunar standstill''' is the gradually varying range between the northern and the southern limits of the Moon's [[declination]], or the '''lunistices''', over the course of one-half a [[Lunar month#Sidereal month|sidereal month]] (about two [[week]]s), or 13.66 days. (Declination is a [[equatorial coordinate system|celestial coordinate]] measured as the angle from the [[celestial equator]], analogous to [[latitude]].) One major, or one minor, lunar standstill occurs every 18.6 years due to the [[Lunar precession#Nodal precession|precessional cycle]] of the [[lunar node]]s at that rate.

At a major lunar standstill, the Moon's range of declination, and consequently its range of [[azimuth]] at moonrise and moonset, reaches a maximum. As a result, viewed from the [[middle latitudes]], the Moon's [[horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] at upper [[culmination]] (the daily moment when the object appears to contact the observer's [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]) changes in just two weeks &amp;ndash; from highest to lowest above the [[horizon]] due north or south, depending on the observer's [[hemispheres of Earth|hemisphere]]. Similarly, its azimuth at moonrise changes from northeast to southeast and at moonset from northwest to southwest.

This time appears to have had special significance for the [[Bronze Age]] societies, who built the [[megalithic monument]]s in [[prehistoric Britain|Britain]] and [[Prehistoric Ireland|Ireland]]. It also has significance for some [[neopagan]] religions. Evidence also exists that alignments to the moonrise or moonset on the days of lunar standstills can be found in ancient sites of other ancient cultures, such as at [[Chimney Rock National Monument|Chimney Rock]] in [[Colorado]] and [[List of Hopewell sites|Hopewell Sites]] in [[Ohio]].

==Origin of name==
The term ''lunar standstill'' was apparently first used by archeologist [[Alexander Thom]] in his 1971 book ''Megalithic Lunar Observatories''.&lt;ref name=vincent3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vincent|first=Fiona|title=A major ‘lunar standstill’|journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association|date=2005|volume=115|issue=4|pages=220|url=http://www.britastro.org/jbaa/pdf/115-4forum.pdf|accessdate=14 January 2012|bibcode=2005JBAA..115..220V}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[solstice]]'', which derives from the Latin ''solstitium'': ''sol''- (sun) + -''stitium'' (a stoppage), describes the similar extremes in the Sun's varying declination. Neither the Sun nor the Moon stands still, obviously; what stops, momentarily, is the change in declination. The word ''[[wiktionary:tropic|tropic]]'', as in [[Tropic of Capricorn]], comes from ancient Greek meaning "to turn", referring to how ascending (or descending) motion turns to descending (or ascending) motion at the solstice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tropic?s=t Dictionary.com – tropic]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal explanation==
[[File:Lunar standstill.GIF|thumb]]
{{see|Equatorial coordinate system}}

As [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] on its axis, the stars in the [[night sky]] appear to follow [[star trail|circular paths]] around the [[celestial pole]]s. (This daily cycle of apparent movement is called [[diurnal motion]].) All the stars seem [[fixed stars|fixed]] on a [[celestial sphere]] surrounding the observer. In the same way that [[spherical coordinate system|positions]] on Earth are measured using [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], the [[apparent place]]s of stars on this sphere are measured in [[right ascension]] (equivalent to longitude) and [[declination]] (equivalent to latitude). If viewed from a latitude of [[50th parallel north|50° N]] on Earth, any star with a declination of +50° would pass directly overhead (reaching the [[zenith]] at upper [[culmination]]) once every [[sidereal time|sidereal day]] (23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds), whether visible at [[night]] or obscured in [[daylight]].

Unlike the stars, the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] do not have a fixed declination. Since Earth's rotational [[axial tilt|axis is tilted]] about 23.5° with respect to a line perpendicular to its [[orbital plane]] (the [[ecliptic]]), the Sun's declination ranges from +23.5° on the [[June solstice]] to −23.5° on the [[December solstice]], as [[Earth's orbit|Earth orbits]] the Sun once every [[tropical year]]. Therefore in June, in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the [[noon|midday]] Sun is higher in the sky, and [[daytime]] then is longer than in December. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the situation is reversed. This obliquity causes Earth's [[season]]s.

The Moon's declination also changes, completing a cycle once every lunar [[nodal period]]: 27.212 days. Thus, lunar declination ranges from a positive value to a negative one in just under [[fortnight|two weeks]], and back. Consequently in under a month, the Moon's [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] at upper [[culmination]] (when it contacts the observer's [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]) can shift from higher in the sky to lower above the horizon, and back.

The Moon differs from most [[natural satellite]]s around other planets in that it remains near the [[ecliptic]] (the plane of [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun) instead of Earth's [[celestial equator|equatorial plane]]. The Moon's maximum and minimum declination vary because the [[orbital plane|plane]] of the [[orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]] around Earth is inclined about 5.14° with respect to the ecliptic plane, and the spatial direction of the Moon's [[orbital inclination]] gradually changes over an 18.6-year cycle, alternately adding to or subtracting from the 23.5° tilt of Earth's axis.

Therefore, the maximum declination of the Moon varies roughly from (23.5° − 5° =) 18.5° to (23.5° + 5° =) 28.5°. At the minor lunar standstill, the Moon will change its declination during the nodal period from +18.5° to −18.5°, for a total range of 37°. Then 9.3 years later, during the major lunar standstill, the Moon will change its declination during the nodal period from +28.5° to −28.5°, which totals 57° in range. This range is enough to bring the Moon's altitude at [[culmination]] from high in the sky to low above the horizon in just two weeks (half an orbit).

Strictly speaking, the lunar standstill is a moving position in space relative to the direction of Earth's axis and to [[nodal precession|the rotation]] of the Moon's [[orbital node]]s ([[lunar node|lunar nodal]] [[lunar prescession|precession]]) once every 18.6 years. The standstill position does not persist over the two weeks that the Moon takes to move from its maximum (positive) declination to its minimum (negative) declination, and it most likely will not exactly coincide with either extreme.

However, because the 18.6-year cycle of standstills is so much longer than the Moon's [[Lunar month#Sidereal month|orbital period]] (about 27.3 days) that the change in the declination range over periods as short as half an orbit is very small. The period of the lunar nodes precessing in space is slightly shorter than the lunar standstill interval due to Earth's [[axial precession]], altering Earth's axial tilt over a very long period relative to the direction of lunar nodal precession. Simply, the standstill cycle results from the combination of the two inclinations.

==Apparent position of the Moon during standstill==
The [[azimuth]] (horizontal direction) of moonrise and moonset varies according to the Moon's [[nodal period]] of 27.212 days, while the azimuth variation during each nodal period varies with the lunar standstill period (18.613 years).

For a latitude of [[55th parallel north|55° north]] on Earth, the following table shows moonrise and moonset azimuths for the Moon's narrowest and widest arc paths across the sky. The azimuths are given in degrees from [[true north]] and apply when the horizon is unobstructed. Figures for a time midway between major and minor standstill are also given.

The arc path of the [[full moon|full Moon]] generally reaches its widest in midwinter and its narrowest in midsummer. The widest arc path of the [[new moon|new Moon]] (when it near the Sun in the sky) is in the summer, as for the Sun.&lt;ref name=burl&gt;{{cite book |last=Burl |first=Aubrey |title=A Guide to the Stone Circles of Britain, Ireland and Brittany |date=1995 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=9780300063318 |pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For observers at the [[middle latitudes]] (not too near the [[Equator]] or either [[geographical pole|pole]]), the Moon is highest in the sky in each period of 24 hours when it reaches the observer's [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. During the month, these [[culmination]] altitudes vary so as to produce a greatest value and a least value. The following table shows these altitudes at different times in the lunar nodal period for an observer at 55° north. The greatest and least culminations occur about two weeks apart.

==Detailed explanation==
[[File:lunar orbit.png|thumb|300px|Apparent paths of the Sun and Moon on the [[celestial sphere]] (angles exaggerated for clarity)]]

A more detailed explanation is best considered in terms of the paths of the Sun and Moon on the [[celestial sphere]], as shown in the first diagram. This shows the abstract sphere surrounding the Earth at the center. The Earth is oriented so that its axis is vertical.

The Sun is, by definition, always seen on the [[ecliptic]] (the Sun's apparent path across the sky) while Earth is tilted at an angle of ''e''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;23.5° to the plane of that path and completes one orbit around the Sun in 365.25636 days, slightly longer than one year due to precession altering the direction of Earth's inclination.

The Moon's orbit around Earth (shown dotted) is inclined at an angle of ''i'' = 5.14° relative to the ecliptic. The Moon completes one orbit around the Earth in 27.32166 days. The two points at which Moon crosses the ecliptic are known as its [[orbital node]]s, shown as "N1" and "N2" (ascending node and descending node, respectively), and the line connecting them is known as the ''line of nodes''. Due to [[apsidal precession|precession]] of the Moon's [[orbital inclination]], these crossing points, the nodes and the positions of eclipses, gradually shift around the ecliptic in a period of 18.59992 years.

Looking at the diagram, note that when the Moon's line of nodes (N1 &amp; N2) rotates a little more than shown, and aligns with Earth's equator, (from front to back, N1, Earth, and N2, seem to be the same dot), the Moon's orbit will reach its steepest angle with the Earth's equator, and in 9.3 years (from front to back, N2, Earth, N1 seem to be the same dot) it will be the shallowest: the 5.14° declination (tilt) of the Moon's orbit either adds to (major standstill) or subtracts from (minor standstill) the inclination of earth's rotation axis (23.439°).

[[File:LunarDec2006.png|thumb|300px|The declination of the Moon in 2005–06]]

The effect of this on the declination of the Moon is shown in the second diagram. During the course of the nodal period, as the Moon orbits the Earth, its declination swings from –''m''° to +''m''°, where ''m'' is a number in the range (''e''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''i'')&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;(''e''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''i''). At a minor standstill (e.g., in 2015), its declination during the month varies from –(''e''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''i'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;–18.5° to +(''e''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;''i'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;18.5°. During a major standstill (e.g., in 2005-2006), the declination of the Moon varied during each month from about –(''e''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''i'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;–28.5° to +(''e''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''i'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;28.5°.

[[File:LunarMaxima2006.png|thumb|300px|The maximum declinations of the Moon in 2005–06]]

However, an additional subtlety further complicates the picture. The Sun's gravitational attraction on the Moon pulls it toward the plane of the ecliptic, causing a slight wobble of about 9 arcmin within a 6-month period. In 2006, the effect of this was that, although the 18.6-year maximum occurred in June, the maximum declination of the Moon was not in June but in September, as shown in the third diagram.

==Other complications==
Because the Moon is relatively close to the Earth, [[lunar parallax]] alters declination up to 0.95° when observed from Earth's surface versus geocentric declination, the declination of the Moon from the center of the Earth. Geocentric declination may be up to about 0.95° different from the observed declination. The amount of this parallax varies with latitude, hence the observed maximum of each standstill cycle varies according to position of observation.

[[Atmospheric refraction]] – the bending of the light from the Moon as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere – alters the observed declination of the Moon, more so at low elevation, where the atmosphere is thicker (deeper).

Not all the maxima are observable from all places in the world – the Moon may be below the horizon at a particular observing site during the maximum, and by the time it rises, it may have a lower declination than an observable maximum at some other date.

Note that all dates and times in this section, and in the table, are in [[UTC]], all celestial positions are in topocentric apparent coordinates, including the effects of parallax and refraction, and the lunar phase is shown as the fraction of the Moon's disc which is illuminated.

In 2006, the ''minimum'' lunar declination, as seen from the centre of the Earth, was at 16:54 UTC on 22 March, when the Moon reached an apparent declination of −28:43:23.3. The next two best contenders were 20:33 on 29 September, at a declination of −28:42:38.3 and 13:12 on 2 September at declination −28:42:16.0.

The ''maximum'' lunar declination, as seen from the centre of the Earth, was at 01:26 on 15 September, when the declination reached +28:43:21.6. The next highest was at 07:36 on 4 April, when it reaches +28:42:53.9

However, these dates and times do not represent the maxima and minima for observers on the Earth's surface.

For example, after taking refraction and parallax into account, the observed maximum on 15 September in Sydney, Australia was several hours earlier, and then occurred in daylight. The table on the right shows the major standstills that were actually visible (i.e. not in full daylight, and with the Moon above the horizon) from both London, UK, or Sydney, Australia.

For other places on the Earth's surface, positions of the Moon can be calculated using the [http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi JPL ephemeris calculator].

The '''Michigan Alternative and Renewable Energy Center''' (MAREC) was a facility located in [[Muskegon, Michigan]] that promoted research, education and business development in [[alternative energy|alternative]] and [[renewable energy]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.absolutemichigan.com/search/?linkid=7189 |title=The Michigan Alternative and Renewable Energy Center (MAREC) |publisher=Absolute Michigan |work= |accessdate=July 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129015932/http://absolutemichigan.com/search/?linkid=7189 |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, the Center was renamed the Muskegon Innovation Center and the organization refocused on supporting innovation and entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mibiz.com/item/23649-gvsu%25E2%2580%2599s-marec-relaunches-under-new-name,-co-working-space-in-muskegon|title=GVSU’s MAREC relaunches with new name, co-working space in Muskegon|last=Wiegand|first=John|website=mibiz.com|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
Development and planning for the center began in 1999 when a group of [[Grand Valley State University]] faculty and Muskegon business people proposed a research and development facility focused on alternative energy. Subsequent partnerships between the business, community, and the private sector resulted in groundbreaking for the center in late 2002, and its completion in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==The building==
The {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|-2|sing=on}} facility was powered, in part, by a fuel cell and a micro turbine, which turned natural gas into electricity. In addition, the building's photovoltaic solar roof tiles harnessed the solar power generated by the sun to create useful energy. MAREC then used a nickel metal hydride battery system to store some of the energy produced by these sources for use during peak energy consumption periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/3702.htm |title=Michigan Alternative &amp; Renewable Energy Center |publisher=The Chief Engineer |work= |accessdate=July 14, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was also constructed using many alternative and renewable building materials including flooring surfaces produced from fast-growing bamboo and recycled tires, and rigid wall surfaces made from pressed wheat. These materials were used to conserve and recycle valuable natural resources.

==Economic development==
MAREC was part of the Muskegon Lakeshore SmartZone, a joint venture with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, the city of [[Muskegon]], and [[Grand Valley State University]]. The Muskegon Lakeshore SmartZone is intended to promote and attract high technology business development in Muskegon and the region.

MAREC had {{convert|4000|sqft|m2|-2}} of space devoted to incubating businesses that would research and develop alternative energy sources and uses. The focus on alternative energy was expected to be a catalyst for economic development and job growth in the area. Research and development initiatives was also intended to fuel business expansion at Edison Landing, the {{convert|32|acre|m2|adj=on}} SmartZone being transformed into a multi-use office, retail, and residential center. Overall SmartZone development was expected to complement the array of human, physical, and capital investments made at MAREC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20537">'''Modularity of mind''' is the notion that a [[mind]] may, at least in part, be composed of innate neural structures or modules which have distinct established [[evolution]]arily developed functions. Somewhat different definitions of "module" have been proposed by different authors.

==Early investigations==
Historically, questions regarding the ''functional architecture'' of the mind have been divided into two different theories of the nature of the faculties. The first can be characterized as a horizontal view because it refers to mental processes as if they are interactions between faculties such as memory, imagination, judgement, and perception, which are not [[domain specificity|domain specific]] (e.g., a judgement remains a judgement whether it refers to a perceptual experience or to the conceptualization/comprehension process). The second can be characterized as a vertical view because it claims that the mental faculties are differentiated on the basis of domain specificity, are genetically determined, are associated with distinct neurological structures, and are computationally autonomous.

The vertical vision goes back to the 19th century movement called [[phrenology]] and its founder [[Franz Joseph Gall]], who claimed that the individual mental faculties could be associated precisely, in a sort of one-to-one correspondence, with specific physical areas of the brain. Hence, someone's level of intelligence, for example, could be literally "read off" from the size of a particular bump on his posterior parietal lobe. This simplistic view of modularity has been disproven over the course of the last century.

==Fodor's ''Modularity of Mind''==
In the 1980s, however, [[Jerry Fodor]] revived the idea of the modularity of mind, although without the notion of precise physical localizability. Drawing from [[Noam Chomsky]]'s idea of the [[language acquisition device]] and other work in [[linguistics]] as well as from the [[philosophy of mind]] and the implications of [[optical illusion]]s, he became a major proponent of the idea with the 1983 publication of ''Modularity of Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry A. (1983). ''Modularity of Mind: An Essay on Faculty Psychology''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-56025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fodor, a module falls somewhere between the behaviorist and cognitivist views of lower-level processes.

[[Behaviorism|Behaviorists]] tried to replace the mind with reflexes which Fodor describes as encapsulated (cognitively impenetrable or unaffected by other cognitive domains) and non-inferential (straight pathways with no information added). Low level processes are unlike reflexes in that they are inferential. This can be demonstrated by [[argument from poverty of the stimulus|poverty of the stimulus]] arguments in which the proximate stimulus, that which is initially received by the brain (such as the 2D image received by the retina), cannot account for the resulting output (for example, our 3D perception of the world), thus necessitating some form of computation.

In contrast, [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] saw lower level processes as continuous with higher level processes, being inferential and cognitively penetrable (influenced by other cognitive domains, such as beliefs). The latter has been shown to be untrue in some cases, such as with many visual illusions (ex. [[Müller-Lyer illusion]]), which can persist despite a person's awareness of their existence. This is taken to indicate that other domains, including one's beliefs, cannot influence such processes.

Fodor arrives at the conclusion that such processes are inferential like higher order processes and encapsulated in the same sense as reflexes.

Although he argued for the modularity of "lower level" cognitive processes in ''Modularity of Mind'' he also argued that higher level cognitive processes are not modular since they have dissimilar properties. ''The Mind Doesn't Work That Way'', a reaction to [[Steven Pinker]]'s ''[[How the Mind Works]]'', is devoted to this subject.

Fodor (1983) states that modular systems must—at least to "some interesting extent"—fulfill certain properties:
# Domain specificity: modules only operate on certain kinds of inputs—they are specialised
# Informational encapsulation: modules need not refer to other psychological systems in order to operate
# Obligatory firing: modules process in a mandatory manner
# Fast speed: probably due to the fact that they are encapsulated (thereby needing only to consult a restricted database) and mandatory (time need not be wasted in determining whether or not to process incoming input)
# Shallow outputs: the output of modules is very simple
# Limited accessibility
# Characteristic [[ontogeny]]: there is a regularity of development
# Fixed neural architecture.

Pylyshyn (1999) has argued that while these properties tend to occur with modules, one—information encapsulation—stands out as being the real signature of a module; that is the encapsulation of the processes inside the module from both cognitive influence and from cognitive access.&lt;ref&gt;Pylyshyn, Z.W. (1999). Is vision continuous with cognition? The case for cognitive impenetrability of visual perception. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22(3), 341-423. [http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ftp/pub/papers/bbs1999_reprint.pdf Full text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511184911/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ftp/pub/papers/bbs1999_reprint.pdf |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is that conscious awareness of the [[Müller-Lyer illusion]] being an illusion does not correct visual processing.&lt;ref name=FP2007/&gt;

==Evolutionary psychology and massive modularity==
Other perspectives on modularity come from [[evolutionary psychology]], particularly from the work of [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]]. This perspective suggests that modules are units of mental processing that evolved in response to selection pressures. On this view, much modern human psychological activity is rooted in adaptations that occurred earlier in [[human evolution]], when [[natural selection]] was forming the modern human species.

Evolutionary psychologists propose that the mind is made up of genetically influenced and domain-specific&lt;ref&gt;Cosmides, L. &amp; Tooby, J. (1994). Origins of Domain Specificity: The Evolution of Functional Organization. In L.A. Hirschfeld and S.A. Gelmen, eds., Mapping the Mind: Domain Specificity in Cognition and Culture. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Reprinted in R. Cummins and D.D. Cummins, eds., Minds, Brains, and Computers. Oxford: Blackwell, 2000, 523-543.&lt;/ref&gt; mental algorithms or computational modules, designed to solve specific evolutionary problems of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Cosmides, L., &amp; Tooby, J. (1992). Cognitive Adaptations for Social Exchange. In Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby 1992, 163-228.&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmides and Tooby also state in a brief "primer" on their website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html |title=Evolutionary Psychology Primer by Leda Cosmides and John Tooby |publisher=Psych.ucsb.edu |date=1997-01-13 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "…the brain is a physical system. It functions like a computer," "…the brain’s function is to process information," "different neural circuits are specialized for solving different adaptive problems," and "our modern skulls house a stone age mind."

The definition of ''module'' has caused confusion and dispute. J. A. Fodor initially  defined module as "functionally specialized cognitive systems" that have nine features but not necessarily all at the same time. In his views modules can be found in peripheral  processing such as low-level visual processing but not in central processing. Later he  narrowed the two essential features to ''domain-specificity'' and ''information  encapsulation''. Frankenhuis and Ploeger&lt;ref name=FP2007/&gt; write that domain-specificity means that "a given cognitive mechanism accepts, or is specialized to operate on, only a specific class of information". Information encapsulation  means that information processing in the module cannot be affected by information in the  rest of the brain. One example is that being aware that a certain optical illusion, caused by low  level processing, is false does not prevent the illusion from persisting.&lt;ref name=FP2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Frankenhuis | first1 = W. E. | last2 = Ploeger | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1080/09515080701665904 | title = Evolutionary Psychology Versus Fodor: Arguments for and Against the Massive Modularity Hypothesis | journal = Philosophical Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 687 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists instead usually define modules as functionally specialized  cognitive systems that are domain-specific and may also contain innate knowledge about the  class of information processed. Modules can be found also for central processing. This  theory is sometimes referred to as ''massive modularity.''&lt;ref name=FP2007/&gt;

A 2010 review by evolutionary psychologists Confer et al. suggested that domain general theories, such as for "rationality," has several problems: 1. Evolutionary  theories using the idea of numerous  domain-specific adaptions have produced testable predictions that have been empirically  confirmed; the theory of domain-general rational thought has produced no such predictions  or confirmations. 2. The rapidity of responses such as jealousy due to infidelity indicates  a domain-specific dedicated module rather than a general, deliberate, rational calculation  of consequences. 3. Reactions may occur instinctively (consistent with innate knowledge)  even if a person has not learned such knowledge. One example being that in the ancestral  environment it is unlikely that males during development learn that infidelity (usually  secret) may cause paternal uncertainty (from observing the phenotypes of children born many  months later and making a statistical conclusion from the phenotype dissimilarity to the cuckolded fathers).&lt;ref name=AmPs2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Confer | first1 = J.

Clune et al. (2013) have argued that computer simulations of the evolution of neural nets suggest that modularity evolves because, compared to non-modular networks, connection costs are lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Clune |first1= Jeff |last2= Mouret |first2= Jean-Baptiste |last3= Lipson |first3= Hod |year= 2013 |title= The evolutionary origins of modularity |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume= 280 |issue= 1755 |pages= |publisher= |doi= 10.1098/rspb.2012.2863 |arxiv= 1207.2743|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several groups of critics, including psychologists working within evolutionary frameworks,&lt;ref name="Panksepp, J. 2000"&gt;Panksepp, J. &amp; Panksepp, J. (2000). [http://www.flyfishingdevon.co.uk/salmon/year3/psy364criticisms-evolutionary-psychology/panksepp_seven_sins.pdf The Seven Sins of Evolutionary Psychology. Evolution and Cognition], 6:2, 108-131.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the massively modular theory of mind does little to explain adaptive psychological traits. Proponents of other models of the mind argue that the [[computational theory of mind]] is no better at explaining human behavior than a theory with mind entirely a product of the environment. Even within evolutionary psychology there is discussion about the degree of modularity, either as a few generalist modules or as many highly specific modules.&lt;ref name="Panksepp, J. 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buller, David J. and Valerie Gray Hardcastle (2005) Chapter 4. "Modularity", in Buller, David J. The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology. The MIT Press. pp. 127 - 201&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics suggest that there is little empirical support in favor of the domain-specific theory beyond performance on the [[Wason selection task]], a task critics state is too limited in scope to test all relevant aspects of reasoning.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Davies |first1= Paul Sheldon |last2= Fetzer |first2= James H. |last3= Foster |first3= Thomas R. |year= 1995 |title= Logical reasoning and domain specificity |journal= [[Biology and Philosophy]] |volume= 10 |issue= 1 |pages= 1&amp;ndash;37 |publisher= |doi= 10.1007/BF00851985 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= O'Brien |first1= David |authorlink1= |last2= Manfrinati |first2= Angela |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Mike |editor1-last= Oaksford |editor1-link= |editor2-last= Chater |editor2-first= Nick |title= Cognition and Conditionals: Probability and Logic in Human Thinking |url= |year= 2010 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-19-923329-8 |page= |pages= 39&amp;ndash;54 |chapter= The Mental Logic Theory of Conditional Propositions |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=iQSDOqAvXIoC&amp;pg=PA47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, critics argue that Cosmides and Tooby's conclusions contain several inferential errors and that the authors use untested evolutionary assumptions to eliminate rival reasoning theories.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lloyd |first1= Elizabeth A. |last2= |first2= |year= 1999 |title= Evolutionary Psychology: The Burdens of Proof |journal= Biology and Philosophy |volume= 19 |issue= 2 |pages= 211–233 |publisher= |doi= 10.1023/A:1006638501739 |url= http://philpapers.org/archive/LLOEPT.pdf |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace (2010) observes that the evolutionary psychologists' definition of "mind" has been heavily influenced by [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] and/or [[information processing]] definitions of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, B. (2010). Getting Darwin Wrong: Why Evolutionary Psychology Won’t Work. Exeter, UK: Imprint Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics point out that these assumptions underlying evolutionary psychologists' hypotheses are controversial and have been contested by some psychologists, philosophers, and neuroscientists. For example, [[Jaak Panksepp]], an affective neuroscientist, point to the "remarkable degree of neocortical plasticity within the human brain, especially during development" and states that "the developmental interactions among ancient special-purpose circuits and more recent general-purpose brain mechanisms can generate many of the "modularized" human abilities that evolutionary psychology has entertained."&lt;ref name="Panksepp, J. 2000"/&gt;

Philosopher David Buller agrees with the general argument that the human mind has evolved over time but disagrees with the specific claims evolutionary psychologists make. He has argued that the contention that the mind consists of thousands of modules, including sexually dimorphic jealousy and parental investment modules, are unsupported by the available [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Buller |first1= David J. |last2= |first2= |year= 2005 |title= Evolutionary psychology: the emperor's new paradigm |journal= Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume= 9 |issue= 6 |pages= 277–283 |publisher= |doi= 10.1016/j.tics.2005.04.003|url= http://commons.lib.niu.edu/bitstream/10843/13182/1/BullerTiCS%20Reprint.pdf |accessdate=March 23, 2013 |pmid=15925806}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has suggested that the "modules" result from the brain's developmental [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] and that they are adaptive responses to local conditions, not past evolutionary environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Buller |first1= David J. |last2= Hardcastle |first2= Valerie |year= 2000 |title= Evolutionary Psychology, Meet Developmental Neurobiology: Against Promiscuous Modularity |journal= Brain and Mind |volume= 1 |issue= 3 |pages= 307&amp;ndash;325 |publisher= |doi= 10.1023/A:1011573226794 |url= http://commons.lib.niu.edu/bitstream/10843/13181/1/evolutionarypsych.pdf |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Buller has also stated that even if massive modularity is false this does not necessarily have broad implications for evolutionary psychology. Evolution may create innate motives even without innate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Buller |first1= David J. |last2=  |first2=  |year= 2005 |title= Get Over: Massive Modularity |journal= Biology &amp; Philosophy |volume= 20 |issue= 4 |pages= 881–891 |publisher=  |doi= 10.1007/s10539-004-1602-3 |url= http://www.niu.edu/phil/~buller/publications/_pdf/over.pdf |accessdate= March 23, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150317231528/http://www.niu.edu/phil/~buller/publications/_pdf/over.pdf |archive-date= March 17, 2015 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to modular mental structure, some theories posit [[Domain-general learning|domain-general processing]], in which mental activity is distributed across the brain and cannot be decomposed, even abstractly, into independent units. A staunch defender of this view is William Uttal, who argues in ''The New Phrenology'' (2003) that there are serious philosophical, theoretical, and methodological problems with the entire enterprise of trying to localise cognitive processes in the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;Uttal, William R. (2003). ''The New Phrenology: The Limits of Localizing Cognitive Processes in the Brain.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this argument is that a successful [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of mental processes has yet to be developed.

Merlin Donald argues that over evolutionary time the mind has gained adaptive advantage from being a general problem solver.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''A Mind So Rare: The Evolution of Human Consciousness'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060620060057/http://psyc.queensu.ca/faculty/donald/book/mindsorare2.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; The mind, as described by Donald, includes module-like "central" mechanisms, in addition to more recently evolved "domain-general" mechanisms.

In the 1940s and 1950s, [[television receiver]]s were very complex pieces of equipment, often containing upwards of 30 [[vacuum tube]]s, as well as transformers, [[rheostat]]s, and other heavy electronics. The consequent high price limited their potential for high-volume sales. Muntz determined, through trial and error, that he could remove a significant number of parts and still end up with a [[monochrome]] TV that worked very well in urban areas, close to transmission towers. He carried a pair of wire clippers around and when he felt that one of his builders was overengineering a circuit, he would begin snipping components out. When the TV stopped functioning, he would reinsert the last part and leave the TV as it was.&lt;ref name="pease" /&gt;

As a result of removing tubes and greatly simplifying circuits originally designed to boost function in fringe areas (far from transmission towers), Muntz's sets generated less heat, thus diminishing overheating that was one of the most common reasons for failure in early sets. The reduced circuitry also reduced the power requirements; as a result, smaller power supplies could be used, so the sets weighed significantly less. Additionally, as the power supplies contained expensive copper, this further reduced cost.&lt;ref name="pease" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6143">The '''Parkerian hexad''' is a set of six elements of information security proposed by [[Donn B. Parker]] in 1998. The Parkerian hexad adds three additional attributes to the three classic security attributes of the [[CIA triad]] (confidentiality, integrity, availability).

The Parkerian Hexad attributes are the following:
* Confidentiality
* Possession or Control
* Integrity
* Authenticity
* Availability
* Utility

These attributes of information are atomic in that they are not broken down into further constituents; they are non-overlapping in that they refer to unique aspects of information. Any information security breach can be described as affecting one or more of these fundamental attributes of information.

==Confidentiality==
Confidentiality refers to limits on who can get what kind of information.  For example, executives concerned about protecting their enterprise’s strategic plans from competitors; individuals are concerned about unauthorized access to their financial records.

==Possession or Control==
Possession or Control:  Suppose a thief were to steal a sealed envelope containing a bank [[debit card]] and its personal identification number. Even if the thief did not open that envelope, it's reasonable for the victim to be concerned that the thief could do so at any time. That situation illustrates a loss of control or possession of information but does not involve the breach of confidentiality.

==Integrity==
Integrity refers to being correct or consistent with the intended state of information.  Any unauthorized modification of data, whether deliberate or accidental, is a breach of [[data integrity]].  For example, data stored on disk are expected to be stable – they are not supposed to be changed at random by problems with a [[disk controller]].  Similarly, application programs are supposed to record information correctly and not introduce deviations from the intended values.

From Donn Parker: "My definition of information integrity comes from the dictionaries. Integrity means that the information is whole, sound, and unimpared (not necessarily correct). It means nothing is missing from the information it is complete and in intended good order." The author's statement comes close in saying that the information is in a correct...state. Information may be incorrect or not authentic but have integrity or correct and authentic but lacking in integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hintzbergen | first1 = Jule | last2 = Hintzbergen | first2 = Kees | last3 = Baars | first3 = Hans | last4 = Smulders | first4 = André | title = Foundations of Information Security Based on Iso27001 and Iso27002 | publisher = Van Haren Publishing | series = Best Practice | year = 2010 | page = 13 | isbn = 90-8753-568-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
Authenticity refers to the veracity of the claim of origin or authorship of the information. For example, one method for verifying the authorship of a hand written document is to compare the handwriting characteristics of the document to a sampling of others which have already been verified. For electronic information, a [[digital signature]] could be used to verify the authorship of a digital document using [[public-key cryptography]] (could also be used to verify the integrity of the document).

==Availability==
Availability means having timely access to information.  For example, a disk crash or [[denial-of-service attacks]] both cause a breach of availability. Any delay that exceeds the expected service levels for a system can be described as a breach of availability.

==Utility==
Utility means usefulness.  For example, suppose someone encrypted data on disk to prevent unauthorized access or undetected modifications – and then lost the decryption key:  that would be a breach of utility.  The data would be confidential, controlled, integral, authentic, and available – they just wouldn’t be useful in that form. Similarly, conversion of salary data from one currency into an inappropriate currency would be a breach of utility, as would the storage of data in a format inappropriate for a specific computer architecture; e.g., [[EBCDIC]] instead of [[ASCII]] or 9-track [[magnetic tape]] instead of DVD-ROM. A tabular representation of data substituted for a graph could be described as a breach of utility if the substitution made it more difficult to interpret the data.  Utility is often confused with availability because breaches such as those described in these examples may also require time to work around the change in data format or presentation. However, the concept of usefulness is distinct from that of availability.

The '''Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML)''' is a representation format, based on [[XML]], for the encoding and exchange of simulation descriptions on [[computational models]] of biological systems.&lt;ref name="sed-ml"/&gt; It is a free and open community development project.

SED-ML Level 1 Version 1&lt;ref name="Nature Precedings" /&gt; is the first version of SED-ML, allowing to describe time course simulation experiments.

== Structure ==

The SED-ML format is built of five major blocks:

* The Model entity is used to reference the models used in the simulation experiment and to define pre-processing procedures on these models before simulation. Models must be in standard representation formats (e.g., [[SBML]], [[CellML]], [[NeuroML]]). Examples for pre-processing are, e.g., changing the value of an observable, computing the change of a value using mathematics, or general changes on any XML element of the model representation.
* The Simulation entity contains all information about the simulation settings and the steps taken during simulation, e.g., the particular type of simulation and the algorithm used for the execution of the simulation. The simulation algorithm is specified with a [[KiSAO|Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology]] term.
* The Task entity applies one of the defined simulations with one of the referenced models at a time.
* The DataGenerator entity encodes post-processing procedures which need to be applied to the simulation result before output, e.g., normalisation of data.
* The Output entity specifies the simulation output, e.g., the particular plots to be shown.

More information on the SED-ML structure is available from the SED-ML home page&lt;ref name="sed-ml"/&gt; and the reference publication.&lt;ref name="BMC Systems Biology" /&gt;

== History ==

The idea of developing a standard format for simulation experiment encoding was born at the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] (EMBL-EBI). In 2007, Dagmar Waltemath and Nicolas Le Novère started to draft such a format during Dagmar's Marie-Curie funded internship in the Computational Neuroscience group at EMBL-EBI.&lt;ref name="compneur" /&gt;

The SED-ML project was first discussed publicly at the 12th SBML Forum Meeting in 2007, in Long Beach (US). The first version of SED-ML was then presented at the "Super-hackathon "standards and ontologies for Systems Biology"" in Okinawa in 2008. Back then, the language was called MIASE-ML (in accordance with the [[MIASE]] guidelines). In Okinawa, many researchers showed a high interest in the format, and discussions were vital. MIASE became the Minimum Information guideline for simulation experiments. MIASE-ML was renamed into "Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language" (SED-ML).

Level 1 Version 1 of SED-ML officially appeared in March 2011, but SED-ML was presented, discussed and further specified during several community meetings in the years in between, including the combined "CellML-SBGN-SBO-BioPAX-MIASE workshop" in 2009, or the "2010 SBML-BioModels.net Hackathon".

Since then SED-ML has been developed in collaboration with the communities forming the "computational modeling in biology network" [[COMBINE]]. Besides dedicated sessions at various meetings, the development of SED-ML benefits from community interactions on the SED-ML-discuss mailing list.&lt;ref name="discuss" /&gt;

== SED-ML Community ==

SED-ML is part of the [[COMBINE|COmputational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE)]]. Format development is coordinated by an editorial board elected by the community.&lt;ref name="editors" /&gt; Discussions take place at SED-ML-discuss.&lt;ref name="discuss" /&gt;

Popular music has many signs in itself because it has many components and uses, but it also appeals to the emotions of a generation. Music is the “logical expression” of feelings, a “symbolic form”.&lt;ref name=Langer&gt;{{cite book|last=Langer|first=S.K.|title=Philosophy in a New Key: A Study of the Symbolism of Reason, Rite, and Art|year=1942|publisher=Pelican book|location=Cambridge, Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music videos are an example of [[syntagm]], which interacting [[sign (semiotics)|signifiers]] form a meaningful whole.&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=USA and Canada|isbn=978-0-415-36375-4|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music videos are also considered [[multimodal interaction|multimodal]] genres because one semiotic system is joined syntagmatically to another semiotic system, which results in a signified indexical meaning.&lt;ref name=Lemke&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemke|first=J|title=Multimodal Genres and Transmedia Traversals: Social Semiotics and the Political Economy of the Sign|journal=Semiotica|year=2009|volume=173|issue=1-4|pages=283–297|doi=10.1515/SEMI.2009.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of music correlated with visuals can be described in terms of two basic mechanisms: temporal [[synchronicity]] and cross-modal [[Homology (sociology)|homology]].&lt;ref name=Eisenstein&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisenstein|first=Sergi|title=The Film Sense|year=1943|publisher=Farber|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating the two modalities, sound and image, we can interpret it as a unified syntagm.&lt;ref name="Lemke"/&gt; Music videos are known to be visually secondary signified in combination with the [[semantic]] content of the lyrics.&lt;ref name=Bjornberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bjornberg|first=Alf|title=Structural Relationships in Music Video|journal=Popular Music|year=1994|volume=13|pages=51–74|doi=10.1017/S026114300000684X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semiotics in music videos is different from a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] analysis because we can uphold that semiotics searches for meaning by considering sign production and progress, while pragmatics searches for meaning by considering the intentions of semantics and the context it has evolved in.&lt;ref name=Chattah&gt;{{cite web|last=Chattah|first=J.R.|title=Semitoics, Pragmatics and Metaphor in Film Music Analysis|url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04042006-140957/unrestricted/JuanChattah_Dissertation.pdf|work=(Doctoral Dissertation)|publisher=Electronic Theses, Florida State University|accessdate=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are early critics of the importance of analyzing music videos as a semiotic system. [[Frederic Jameson]]'s definition of music videos is a schizophrenic string of isolated, discontinued signifiers, failing to link up into a coherent sequence, as a string without a center.&lt;ref name=Peeters&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peeters|first=H|title=The Semiotics of Music Videos: It Must be Written in the Stars|journal=Image and Narrative|year=2004|volume=8|issue=1760-678X|url=http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/issue08/heidipeeters.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invisible editing==
Many semiotic analysts have examined music videos to decode messages that are being sent to viewers. Invisible editing, a semiotic term, that film editors use to almost decode the message for the audience using narrative actions. [[Daniel Chandler]]'s example from famous film editor, Ralph Rosenblum, "a man awakens suddenly in the middle of the night, bolts up in bed, stares ahead intensely, and twitches his nose. Then the film directs towards a room where two people are desperately fighting a billowing blaze"&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt;(Chandler, pp.&amp;nbsp;166, 2007). Because of the actions of the actors, the audience is aware of the next scene before it is shown. An example of invisible editing in music videos would be in [[narrative]] style, which consist of a plot and storyline of events and characters&lt;ref name=Vernallis /&gt; [[Michael Jackson]]'s music video, ''Thriller'' is considered a narrative script, and it exceeds the song itself. In this case, the context of visual narrative semantically over-powers the meaning of the song itself. Many music videos use narrative style script, which is considered a more formal approach as the editing will add emphasis to the song's chorus, giving it a deeply ingrained musical [[archetype]].&lt;ref name="Bjornberg"/&gt; Music videos that aren't formally organized usually have no segmentation markings that flow with the lyrics, and contain [[abstract art|abstract]] images. ''Sledgehammer'', by [[Peter Gabriel]] is an example of formally unorganized music videos. In general, music videos contain visuals that either represent the potential [[connotative]] meaning of the lyrics or the visuals can represent a semiotic system of its own. Although many analysts explain the music video as being a narrative structure, there are many videos that defy narrative conventions.&lt;ref name=Vernallis&gt;{{cite book|last=Vernallis|first=Carol|title=Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context|year=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11798-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intertextuality==
[[Intertextuality]], for media purposes, references other popular culture objects within their video, and then the audience creates their meaning of the video according to the intentional suggestion created with relationships between primary and secondary texts.&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=James|title=Film and Television after DVD|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=NY|isbn=0-203-89429-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, intertextuality is considered links within a context or medium that bind text to other text (Chandler, pp.&amp;nbsp;166, 2007&lt;ref name=Chandler /&gt; ). Many editors and directors use intertextuality in music videos because it combines different cultural [[codes]] taken from previous texts that are sensible for many audiences. Using intertextuality in music videos allow a viewer to identify with their [[theoretical]] framework of knowledge, and use it to define their identity. This approach can be used to gain popularity for referenced ideas, and influence consumers with a persuasive agenda. ''[[Material Girl]]'', by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is an example of using intertextuality because she is acting like [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend]].'' This is a direct cinematic reference which allows an active audience to draw conclusions to the meaning of the message.

==Intratextuality==
[[Intratextuality]] is a term that is derived from intertextuality, but is considered combining secondary references for marketing and promotional purposes. This type of technique is also called anchorage, found by [[Roland Barthes]]:&lt;ref name=Barthes&gt;{{cite book|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=Image, Music, Text|year=1977|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York|isbn=0-374-52136-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; anchoring text to a context that changes the intentional meaning. An example of this would be, the music video, ''Right Now'', by [[Van Halen]]. The lyrics of the song ''Right Now'' suggest an entirely different meaning than the social empowering messages shown through the music video.

==Bricolage==
[[Bricolage]] is also an example of using many different texts within a context for promotional, marketing, or popularity value.&lt;ref name=Corona&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corona|first=V|title=Memory Monsters and Lady Gaga|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|year=2011|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2011.00809.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5931.2011.00809.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lady Gaga]] uses cultural bricolage in her music videos by using fashion and previous memorable characteristics of former pop stars. Michael Jackson's ''Leave Me Alone'' is also a form of bricolage because it is a collage of already popular people and pop culture [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s combined to portray his own message.

{{nihongo|'''''Sexfriend'''''|セックスフレンド|Sekkusufurendo}} is a [[hentai]] [[computer game]] and [[anime]]. ''Sexfriend'' focuses on the [[protagonist]], Tomohiro Takabe, who has his first sexual encounter in the nurse's office after school with his classmate, Mina Hayase. He eventually desires a real romantic relationship, not just "friends with benefits." Another student, Kaori Nonomiya, sees Takabe and Hayase having sex and runs off disappointed because she loves Takabe. She eventually joins them in a threesome.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1972">'''Simulation noise''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that creates a [[divergence-free]] field.  This signal can be used in artistic simulations for the purposes of increasing the perception of extra detail.

The function can be calculated in three dimensions by dividing the space into a regular lattice grid.  With each edge is associated a random value, indicating a rotational component of material revolving around the edge. By following rotating material into and out of faces, one can quickly sum the flux passing through each face of the lattice.  Flux values at lattice faces are then interpolated to create a field value for all positions.

[[Perlin noise]] is the earliest form of [[lattice noise]], which has become very popular in [[computer graphics]].  Perlin Noise is not suited for simulation because it is not divergence-free.

Noises based on lattices, such as simulation noise and Perlin noise, are often calculated at different frequencies and summed together to form [[band-limited]] [[fractal]] signals. 

Other approaches developed later that use vector calculus identities to produce divergence free fields, such as "Curl-Noise" as suggested by Robert Bridson, and "Divergence-Free Noise" due to Ivan DeWolf.  These often require calculation of lattice noise gradients, which sometimes are not readily available.  A naive implementation would call a lattice noise function several times to calculate its gradient, resulting in more computation than is strictly necessary.  Unlike these noises, simulation noise has a geometric rationale in addition to its mathematical properties.  It simulates vortices scattered in space, to produce its pleasing aesthetic.

'''Global communication''' is the term used to describe ways to connect, share, relate and mobilize across geographic, political, economic, social and cultural divides. It redefines soft and hard power as well as information power and diplomacy in ways not considered by traditional theories of [[International relations theory|international relations]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Global Communication implies a transfer of knowledge and ideas from centers of power to peripheries and the imposition of a new intercultural hegemony by means of the "[[soft power]]" of global news and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tehranian|first1=Maijd|title=Global Communication and international relations: changing paradigms and policies|journal=The International Journal of Peace Studies|url=http://www.gmu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''study of global communication''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies the continuous flows of information used in transferring values, opinions, knowledge, culture across boundaries. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=="International" Or "Global"==
With the end of the twentieth century and the turn of a new millennium, the global arena and the field of international communication were undergoing significant changes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some authors started to use the term global communication because it goes beyond the bounds of individual states and emphasizes communication between and among peoples across borders and, importantly, the rise of transnational media corporations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[International communication]] traditionally refers to communication between and among nation-states and connotes issues of national sovereignty, control of national information resources, and the supremacy of national governments.

Nevertheless, earlier International communication theories have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The old theories only explain part of the global picture and the theories of modernization, dependency, and cultural imperialism have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The term "global", implies a declining role of the state and state sovereignty. As a term, "international" has within it notions of bilateral or multilateral decisions. "Global" could be seen as an aspiration, also as a fear, of the weakening of the state. In addition, global may imply something more pervasive, more geographically inclusive than international. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==

The study of global communication increased dramatically after World War II due to military considerations coupled with their economic and political implications. Earlier attempts at theorizing have failed to develop models or research agendas that match the reality of the contemporary role of global communication {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

More global communication research was written in the decade from 1945–1955; most of the research of the 1950s dealt with propaganda and the cold war. By 1970, global communication research had grown to include a great variety of subjects, especially comparative mass communication systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |edition=1st |title=The Handbook of Comparative Communication Research |url= |publisher=Routledge |date=2012-03-21 |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-415-80275-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; communication and national development and propaganda and public opinion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frederick |first1=Howard H. |title=Global communication and international relations |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RBsQAQAAMAAJ|isbn=9780534193447 |date=1993-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of global communication scholars, previous theories of [[Modernization theory|modernization]], dependency, and [[cultural imperialism]] have failed to satisfactorily explain global communication. The old theories only explain part of the global picture.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mcphail |first1=Thomas L. |title=Global Communication Theories, stakeholders, and Trends |date=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Global_Communication.html?id=MAco-KZGZNIC|isbn=9781444358100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological development===
The emergence of global communication technologies may be considered the origin of the field of global communication in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Numerous technical advances such as the creation of a new major global communication phenomenon, [[Telecommunication convergence|convergence]], digital environments and the internet are some of the major engines driving the change from [[international communication]] to global communication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Global power shifts===
With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union's collapse|Soviet Union]], the shadow of [[Cold War]] has lifted to reveal shifting political, economic, and cultural alliances and conflicts. The increasing importance of these currents, especially in the cultural sphere, demands a reconsideration of the nature of the international communication field within the rubric of international relations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Global Communication in Transition: The End of Diversity?|url = https://www.amazon.com/Global-Communication-Transition-Diversity-Values-ebook/dp/B00YFRD9G6/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450650195&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=global+communication+in+transition|publisher = SAGE Publications, Inc|date = 1996-02-05|first = Hamid|last = Mowlana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===News agencies and propaganda===
Three key players are usually recognized as the founders of the international [[News agency|news agencies]]. In 1835, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] created the world's first news agency; In 1849, [[Bernhard Wolff]] started publishing stock market news and daily reports from Paris, London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt; In 1849, [[Paul Reuter|Paul Julius Freiherr von Reuter]] established his own commercial service, the [[Reuters|Reuter]] agency, and organized a worldwide exchange of news in 1870.

In 1859, Reuter, [[Havas]] and the German [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau|Wolff]] agency reached an agreement to exchange news from all over the world, which was known as the League of Allied Agencies, or the " Ring Combination".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "The Ring Combination": Information, Power, and the World News Agency Cartel|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YDVlAAAAMAAJ|publisher = University of Chicago, Department of History|date = 1999-01-01|first = Alexander Scott|last = Nalbach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, [[Associated Press|American News Agency Associated Press]] was founded and was formally admitted into the "Ring Combination" in 1887.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There are some major factors that point to the growing importance of global communication in the world of the twenty-first century:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# world population explosion

# from [[geopolitics]] to [[Gaia philosophy|gaiapolitics]]

# increased [[cross-cultural communication]]
# changing concept of community
# greater [[Centralisation|centralization of control]]
# information explosion
# changes in technologies
# greater dependence on global communication
# greater [[interdependence]] and democracy
# impact of communication on peace and war

== Theoretical approaches and perspectives ==

=== Transcultural political economy ===

Transcultural Political Economy is a concept that is presented in Global Communications by Paula Chakravartty and Yeuzhi Zhao. This concept looks at global communications and media studies in three major areas: global flows of information and culture, decentralizing the conceptual parameters of global information and media studies, and the normative debates in global communications in the context of neoliberalism. Transcultural Political Economy is a multidisciplinary study that focuses on the tensions between political economy and cultural studies. It "integrate[s] institutional and cultural analyzes and address urgent questions in global communications in the context of economic integration, empire formation, and the tensions associated with adapting new privatized technologies, neoliberalized and globalized institutional structures, and hybrid cultural forms and practices". Transcultural Political Economy addresses the issues surrounding the practice of neoliberalism and its creation of unequal power structures within the world system. 
&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty, P. &amp; Zhao, Y. (2008). Global Communications: toward a transcultural political economy. Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Globalization theory ===
{{See also|Globalization}}

Globalization theory was popularized in the 1990s as a model for understanding global communication. The concept of [[globalization]] inspired a number of theories from various schools of thought in communication studies that each emphasize different aspects of [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization, development and the mass media |last=Sparks |first=Colin |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7619-6161-1 |location=Thousand Oaks, California |pages=126–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many globalization theories highlight actors in the business sector as leaders in the processes of global integration. Transnationalizing business is often celebrated as progression toward a more interconnected world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Globalization theories are often associated with theories of modernity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some scholars view globalization as the social, political, economic, and cultural integration of societies into a capitalist system; Others see globalization as a successor to modernity, while some see it as an iteration of imperialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some question the usefulness and legitimacy of globalization theory, arguing that it does not adequately conceptualize current international relations or function as a lens through which to examine everyday events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Globalization Theory: A Post Mortem |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/pal/ip/2005/00000042/00000001/art00002 |journal=International Politics |date=2005-03-01 |pages=2–74 |volume=42 |issue=1 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800098 |first=Justin |last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars criticize globalization theories as overzealous toward and unrealistic about the extent of global integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why the World Isn't Flat in International Politics: Enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last=Ghemawat |first=Pankaj |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-205-77876-8 |location=United States |pages=322–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars criticize social theorists for offering opinions and predictions based on theory with little practical evidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In contrast, some scholars work to dispute the pessimistic views of globalization theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Art |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Jervis |editor2-first=Robert |title=International politics: enduring concepts and contemporary issues |last1=Micklethwait |first1=John |last2=Woolridge |first2=Adrian |chapter=Why the Globalization Backlash is Stupid in International Politics |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2011 |isbn= |location=United States |pages=348–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World systems theory ===
World-system theory is a macro-sociological perspective that seeks to explain the dynamics of the "capitalist world economy" as a "total social system". A world-system is what Wallerstein terms a "world-economy", integrated through the market rather than a political centre, in which two or more regions are interdependent with respect to necessities like food, fuel, and two or more polities compete for domination without the emergence of one single centre forever.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfrank, Walter L. (2000). "Paradigm Regained? The Rules of Wallerstein's World-System Method. Journal of World-Systems Research. Vol. 6. N. 2 pp. 150-195&lt;/ref&gt; World-system theory was first articulated by Immanuel Wallerstein. There are three major sources of the world-system theory which conceived by Wallerstein: the Annales school's general methodology, Marx's focus on accumulation process and competitive class struggles and so on, and dependence theory's neo-Marxist explanation of development processes.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barfield (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=&amp;redir_esc=y The dictionary of anthropology, Wiley-Blackwell]'', {{ISBN|1-57718-057-7}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the transnational division of labor, world-system divides the world into core countries, peripheral countries, semi-peripheral countries and external areas. The core countries usually developed a strong central governments, extensive bureaucracies and large mercenary armies, which permit the local bourgeoisie to obtain control over international commerce and extract capital surpluses from the trade for benefits.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Paul Halsall(1997) [https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/Wallerstein.asp Modern History Sourcebook: ''Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral countries often lack strong central governments or been controlled by core countries, they export raw materials and rely on coercive labor practices.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Semi-peripheries which served as buffers between the core and the peripheries. They retain limited but declining access to international banking and the production of high-cost high-quality manufactured goods.[3] External areas such as Russia maintain their own economic systems, they want to remain outside the modern world economy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Modernisation theory ===

The theory of modernization was developed by Daniel Lerner (1958) in the "Passing of traditional society." Lerner's description of "modernised" is an individual having the ability to be empathetic and being able to see oneself in another person's situation. This concept has come from the transition of traditional societies to modern societies, where modern societies is distinctively industrial, urban, literate, and participant. This theory looks at development in a linear fashion, concluding that nations need to develop into a modern society to make it a sustainable and flourishing nation. Developing modernized societies include technological advancement, and developing media sectors to help create a participatory culture.

=== Post-colonialism ===
''See also:'' [[Post-structuralism]], [[imperialism]], [[modernity]],

Post-colonialism is a theoretical approach to looking at literature that examines the colonizer-colonized experience. It deals with the adaptation of formerly colonized nations and their development in cultural, political, economical aspects. Some Notable theoreticians include: [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Edward Said]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], [[R Siva Kumar]], [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[Derek Gregory]].

=== Cultural imperialism ===
Cultural imperialism is a mighty civilization exerts culture influence over another. Less economically prominent cultures often import culture from Western countries, which have the economic means to produce a majority of the world's cultural media, mostly via the global transmission of media.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ketchum, [http://classroom.synonym.com/meaning-cultural-imperialism-7841.html What Is the Meaning of Cultural Imperialism?]&lt;/ref&gt; The weak civilization adopts the mighty civilization's customs, philosophies, worldviews and general ways of life. The theoretical foundations of the academic study of cultural imperialism mostly come from Michel Foucault's concept of biopower, governmentality and Edward Saïd's concept of Post-colonialism, which theories see cultural imperialism as the cultural legacy of colonialism or forms of Western hegemony. Media effect study which integrated with political-economy traditional is the core argument of cultural imperialism. There are two opposite effects of media study. The negative one is that Western media imposes socio-political conflicts to the developing country and the latter one's resistance to the media effects to preserve their traditional cultural identities.&lt;ref&gt;G. K., &amp; Tan. A.S. (1987), ''American TV in the Philippines: A test of cultural impact''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; The positive effects are the issues of the process of civilization such as women's right or racial equality with exposing to Western media.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, J. G., &amp; Morgan, M. (1988). ''Culture clash: Impact of U.S. television in Korea''. Journalism Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt; Now the term of cultural imperialism usually refers to America's global culture expansion to the rest of world, which include brand name products, video media, fast food and so on.

=== Communication for development (C4D) ===
[[Communication for Development|Communication for Development (C4D)]] is a [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] oriented aspect of global communication studies that approaches [[Global Development|global development]] with a focus on action and participation for social change enacted through communication systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Evaluating Communication for Development: A Framework for Social Change|last = Lennie &amp; Tacchi|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D underlines "voice, citizenship and collective action" as central values that promote citizen-led development where the visiting party provides guidance rather than direction within the host community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Speaking up and talking back?: Media empowerment and civic engagement among east and southern African youth|last = Tufte, Wildermuth, Hansen-Skovmoes, &amp; Mitullah|first = |publisher = [UNESCO] International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media, Nordicom.|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Göteborg, Sweden|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; C4D often incorporates bottom-up theories of social change with the aim to create sustainable change which is believed to be more likely to occur if the efforts are planned, implemented, and sustained by community members themselves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some development workers and academics suggest that a shared definition of communication for development should be clarified, because disagreement within the field can detract from the characteristics that most scholars view as central to current development, including [[participatory action research]] (PAR).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many C4D projects revolve around media systems as a central site for social change,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which differentiates C4D from other approaches to development. Theories behind C4D highlight that development projects should be contextually situated and that communication technology will affect different types of social change accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Global media studies ===
Global media studies is a field of media study in a global scope. Media study deals with the content, history and effects of media. Media study often draws on theories and methods from the disciplines of cultural studies, rhetoric, philosophy, communication studies, feminist theory, political economy and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan, Daniel and Katz, Elihu (1992). ''Media Events''. London, England: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-55956-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these study approaches, political economic analysis is non-ignorable in understanding the current media and communication developments. But the political economic research has become more resilient because of stronger empirical studies, and the potential connections to policy-making and alternative praxis.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Wasko (2009). Global Media Studies. Television &amp; New Media. Volume 10 Number 1 January 2009 167-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country has its own distinct media ecosystem. The media of mainland China is state-run, so the political subjects are under the strict regulations set by the government while other areas such as sports, finance, and increasingly lucrative entertainment industry face less regulation from government.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cfr.org/about/ Council on Foreign Relations.]''&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has a well-developed media sector, but the mass media is threatened by the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism which hinder the form of Canada's media identity.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, John A. (1969). ''Mass Media in Canada''. The Ryerson Press. p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the media in America are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenues from advertisings, subscriptions and the sale of copyrighted materials. Currently, six corporations (Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom and CBS Corporation) have controlled roughly 90% of the America media.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Lutz (2012) ''[http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6 These 6 Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America.]'' Business Insider. 14 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Such successes come from the policies of the federal government or the tendency to natural monopolies in the industry.

== Central debates ==

=== Global power shifts ===

[[Frog#Locomotion|Immanuel Wallerstein]]'s world system theory develops a basic framework to understand global power shifts in the rise of the modern world. Wallerstein proposes four different categories: '''core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external''', in terms of different region's relative position in the world system. The core regions are the ones that benefited the most from the capitalist world economy, such as England and France. The peripheral areas relied on and exported raw materials to the core, such as Eastern Europe and Latin America. The semi-peripheries are either core regions in decline or peripheries attempting to improve their relative position in the world system, such as Portugal and Spain. The external areas managed to remain outside the modern world economy, such as Russia.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/wallerstein_summary.php/ Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic types of global power shifts in the 21st century. One is traditional power transition amongst states, which follows Wallerstein's world system theory. For instance, the global power shifts from the West to the East since the rise of Asia. The other is power diffusion, the way that power move from states to non-states actors. For instance, "climate change, drug trade, financial flows, pandemics, all these things that cross borders outsider the control of governments."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/joseph_nye_on_global_power_shifts/transcript?language=en#t-832180/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global public sphere ===
[[Public sphere]] theory, attributed to [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]], is a theory that in its basic premise conceives of [[democratic governments]] as those that can stand criticism that comes from public spheres. [[Public sphere]]s are places, physical or imagined, where people discuss any kind of topic, particularly topics of a societal or political nature. Global public sphere is, therefore, a public that is made of people from across the globe, who come together to discuss and act on issues that concern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of global public sphere is linked to the shift of public sphere, from restricted to nation-state, to made of individuals and groups connected across as well as within borders.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|title = International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url = http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|website = web.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Plato, it can be argued that philosophers have been thinking about versions of a common space for all people to debate in; however, a global public sphere that can fit the description above began to appear much later. In the second half of the 20th century, the legacy of World War II and technological advancements created a new sense of the global and started the economic and political phenomena that we now call [[globalization]]. This includes the expansion of humankind into space, which gave individuals the sense of a global unity, the growth of satellite technology, which allowed for people across the globe to view the same television channels, and the internet, which can provide access to an unprecedented amount of information and spaces to connect with other people.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Cultural industries ===
The term "[[culture industry]]" appeared in the [[post-war period]]. At that time, culture and industry were argued to be opposites.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unctad.org/en/Docs/ditctab20103_en.pdf|title = Creative Economy 2010 Report|date = 2010|publisher = UNCTAD}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural industry|Cultural industries]]" are also referred to as the "[[Creative industries]].

==== Definitions and scope of cultural industries ====

In the present day, there remain different interpretations of culture as an industry. For some, cultural industries are simply those industries that produce cultural goods and services.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the cultural industries are regarded as those industries that "combine the creation, production and commercialization of contents which are intangible and cultural in nature. These contents are typically protected by copyright and they can take the form of goods or services". According to [[UNESCO]], an essential part of cultural industries is that they are "central in promoting and maintaining cultural diversity and in ensuring democratic access to culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.unesco.org/themes/protecting-our-heritage-and-fostering-creativity |title=Protecting Our Heritage and Fostering Creativity |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cultural industries" combines the cultural and economic, which gives the cultural industries a distinctive profile.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In France, the "cultural industries" have recently been defined as a set of economic activities that combine the functions of conception, creation and production of culture with more industrial functions in the large-scale manufacture and commercialization cultural products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/Politiques-ministerielles/Etudes-et-statistiques|title = de la prospective et des statistiques|last = |first = |date = 2006|journal = Département des études|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, economic activities involved in the preservation of heritage are also included in the definition of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/87-542-x/2011001/section/s3-eng.htm|title=Defining culture|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global cultural industries ====
Since the rise of the cultural industries has occurred simultaneously with [[economic globalization]], cultural industries have close connections with globalization and global communication.

[[Herbert Schiller]] argued that the 'entertainment, communications and information (ECI) complex were having a direct impact on culture and human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Culture Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science Press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Herbert Schiller|Schiller]] argued, the result of transnational corporate expansion is the perpetuation of [[cultural imperialism]], defined as "the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Cultural Domination|last = Schiller|first = Herbert|publisher = International Arts and Science press|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave of transnational corporate expansion, which began in the 1970s with the emergence of [[Free trade zone|Export Processing Zones]] in developing countries, is focused on the development of [[global production networks]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Creative Industries|last=Flew|first=Terry|publisher=Polity Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7456-4839-2|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=19–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was described as a "new international division of labour" (NIDL) by the German political economists Frӧbel et al. (1980).

Ernst and Kim have argued that GPNs are changing the nature of the multinational corporation itself, from "stand alone overseas investment projects, to "global network [[flagship]]s" that integrate their dispersed supply, knowledge and customer bases into global and regional production networks", entailing a shift from top-down hierarchical models of corporate control to increasingly networked and collective forms of organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Production Networks, Knowledge Diffusion, and Local Capacity Formation|last = Ernst |first=D. |last2=Kim |first2=L. |date = 2002|journal = Research Policy |volume=31|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global media empires ====
The largest firms in media and media-related industries have a very high international profile.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Global media empires such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[News Corporation]], [[Time Warner|Time-Warner]] and [[Viacom]]-[[CBS]] now derive 25-45 per cent of their revenues outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding Global Media|last = Flew.T|first = |publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Basingstoke, UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often argued that the global media are dominated by a small number of powerful media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. Herman and McChesney (1997) argued that the global media were "dominated by three or four dozen large [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporations]] (TNCs) with fewer than ten mostly US-based media conglomerates towering over the global market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Global Media: The New Missionaries of Global Capitalism|last = Herman,E.S &amp; McChesney, R.W|first = |publisher = Cassell|year = 1997|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Manfred Steger]] has observed that " to a very large extent, the global cultural flows of our time are generated and directed by global media empires that rely on powerful communication technologies to spread their message."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last = Steger.M|first = |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2003|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that during the last two decades, a few very large TNCs would come to dominate the global market for entertainment, news, television, and film.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Diaspora ===
[[Diaspora]] is often confused with [[wikt:exodus|exodus]]. Diasporas are minority groups that have a sense of connection with a larger community outside of the borders they currently inhabit, and through diasporic media create a sense of a larger identity and community, whether imagined or real.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In scholarly work about diaspora in communication studies, the view of nation and culture as interchangeable terms is no longer prevalent. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] theorized of hybridity, which he distinguished from "old style pluralism", "nomadic voyaging of the postmodern", and "global homogenization". Hybridity is the retention of an original identity and strong ties to an original country and tradition, but with the understanding that there is no unchanged, ideal nation of the past that they can return to. To be hybrid is to also adapt to a new culture and tradition without simply assimilating in it, but rather negotiating a place between the "original" and "new" cultures.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In Communication studies, diaspora is discussed as the identity that unifies people across time and space, sometimes existing in physical spaces and other times existing in imagined 'non-spaces'. However, it has been argued that the concept of 'diaspora' implies ethnic homogeneity and essentializes identity to only ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; One of the most cited and well-known works in the field of diasporic media is [[Hamid Naficy]]'s work on exiled Iranian Americans' creation of cable television in the United States.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Diasporic media refer to media that address the needs of particular ethnic, religious, and/or linguistic groups that live in multicultural settings {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . Diasporic media can be in the diaspora's traditional language or in another language, and they can include news or media from the "origin" country or they can contain the diaspora's local news or media. Diasporic media can be created in radio, television, film, music, in newspapers, magazines, and other publishing, as well as online. It can be argued that the development and spread of satellite television is an instrumental element of the growth of diasporic media today. Satellite television allowed migrants to access the news and popular culture from their homeland, as well as allowing people who speak the same language to access the same channels that might be produced outside of the "homeland"&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diasporic Media Across Europe: Multicultural Societies and the Universalism–Particularism Continuum|journal = Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|pages = 481–498|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/13691830500058794|first = Myria|last = Georgiou|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary studies of diaspora show that diasporic media are part of the change in the tendency Immanuel Wallerstein described in his world systems theory. The world systems theory postulates that much of the flow of people in the world has been from the 'periphery', or economically-developing states, towards the centre; which are often metropolitan, economically-wealthy states that grew their wealth in colonialist entrepreneurship. However, contrary to the movement of people, the flow of information (including media products), has tended to be from the centre to the periphery.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Go with the Flow: Diasporas and Media|last = Sinclair|first = John|date = February 2000|journal = Television &amp; New Media|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Cunningham|first2 = Stuart|issue = 1:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology and media ===
The advancement of media and technology have played the pivotal role in process of [[globalization]] and global communication.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding the media|last = Devereux|first = Eoin|publisher = SAGE|year = 2007|isbn = 9781412929912|location = London, Los Angeles|pages = 28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cable television]], [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], [[digitalization]], direct broadcast [[satellite]]s as well as the [[Internet]] have created a situation where vast amounts of information can be transferred around the globe in a matter of seconds.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

During the early 20th century, [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephony]], and [[radio]] started the process of global communication.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global Media, Historic Development of|last = Monroe|first = E. Price|date = 2003|journal = Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications, Volume 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As media technologies developed intensely, they were thought to create, in Marshall McLuhan’ s famous words, a ‘‘global village.’’&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]], the world’ s first [[artificial satellite]], on October 4, 1957, marked the beginning of technologies that would further interconnect the world.  The first live global television broadcast occurred when [[Neil Armstrong]] stepped onto the moon in July 1969.  In November 1972, pay TV caused expansion of cable when [[Service Electric]] offered Home Box Office over its cable system. By 2000, over direct broadcast satellite, a household could receive channels from all over the world. Now with the [[World Wide Web]], [[Smartphone|smart phones]], [[Tablet computer|tablet devices]], smart televisions and other digital media devices, billions of people are now able to access media content that was once tied to particular communications media ([[Input/output|print]], broadcast) or platforms ([[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], [[Film|cinema]]).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Justice ===
Justice in communication studies includes, but is not limited to, the concern with democratic process and fostering democratic publics  {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]] theorized of [[public sphere]] (in ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'') as the space that is created whenever matters of common concern are discussed between the state and civil society. Thus, public sphere includes not only the media, but also public protest in the form of marches, demonstrations, et cetera. There are, however, critiques of political economy in whose view it is impossible to work within the current system to produce democratic publics. Such a critique is that produced by [[Karl Marx]], who saw institutions such as parliament, the state, the 'acceptable' public sphere, economic enterprises, and so on as structurally produced and perpetuated by a capitalist system, and thus they can not be mobilized to change it. In such a system, there can only be illusory justice, which is fair only within the logic of the system. This illusion of justice is produced through dominating [[ideology]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Justice and Communication: Mill, Marx, and Habermas|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|journal = Social Justice Research|date = 2009-02-19|issn = 0885-7466|pages = 134–155|volume = 22|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11211-009-0091-6|language = en|first = Martin|last = Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue of justice in communication studies is the question of decolonizing research methods and theoretical discourse {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} . The idea of decolonizing research comes from a rejection of the functionalist approach, which assumed that research can be conducted in a vacuum, free of ideology or the researcher's biases. This approach assumed cultures to be unchanging, homogenous, and isolated from each other. The purpose of decolonizing research and discourse is to 'uncloak' research as an unbiased power structure, and produce research that is more self-aware. The approach in decolonizing research methods attempts to create methodologies that treat the people in the study as participants or partners, rather than subjects - which is a term that in itself carries strong connotations of colonialism. Decolonizing research also involves moving away from Eurocentric models that are assumed to work anywhere else, and instead to create work that is more useful in local contexts. Decolonial approaches specifically seek to produce knowledge about the mechanisms and effects of colonialism. These approaches allow former subjects to 'talk back', which is a reflection of independent agency, on the colonizer's own terms of research, rather than to be 'given' a voice, which is an unequal power structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decolonial Methodologies: Social Justice Perspectives in Intercultural Technical Communication Research|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2190/TW.44.3.e|journal = Journal of Technical Writing and Communication|pages = 297–327|volume = 44|issue = 3|doi = 10.2190/tw.44.3.e|first = Godwin Y.|last = Agboka|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''transient lunar phenomenon''' ('''TLP''') or '''lunar transient phenomenon''' ('''LTP''') is a short-lived light, color, or change in appearance on the surface of the [[Moon]].

Claims of short-lived lunar phenomena go back at least 1,000 years, with some having been observed independently by multiple witnesses or reputable scientists. Nevertheless, the majority of transient lunar phenomenon reports are [[Reproducibility|irreproducible]] and do not possess adequate [[Experimental control|control experiments]] that could be used to distinguish among alternative [[hypotheses]] to explain their origins.

Most lunar scientists will acknowledge that transient events such as [[outgassing]] and [[impact craters|impact cratering]] do occur over [[lunar geologic timescale|geologic time]]: the controversy lies in the frequency of such events.

The term was created by [[Patrick Moore]] in his co-authorship of NASA Technical Report R-277 ''Chronological Catalog of Reported Lunar Events'', published in 1968.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = Chronological Catalog of Reported Lunar Events|url = http://www.astrosurf.com/lunascan/papers/R-277.pdf|website = Astrosurf|publisher = NASA|accessdate = 26 December 2015|language = English|date = 1967|author1 = Barbara M. Middlehurst|last2 = Burley|first2 = Jaylee M.|first3 = Patrick|last3 = Moore|first4 = Barbara L.|last4 = Welther}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of events==
Reports of transient lunar phenomena range from foggy patches to permanent changes of the lunar landscape. Cameron&lt;ref name="c1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://users.aber.ac.uk/atc/tlp/cameron.pdf |format=PDF| author = Winifred S. Cameron | title=Analyses of Lunar Transient Phenomena (LTP) Observations from 557–1994 A.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; classifies these as (1) gaseous, involving mists and other forms of obscuration, (2) reddish colorations, (3) green, blue or violet colorations, (4) brightenings, and (5) darkening. Two extensive catalogs of transient lunar phenomena exist,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="c1" /&gt; with the most recent tallying 2,254 events going back to the 6th century. Of the most reliable of these events, at least one-third come from the vicinity of the [[Aristarchus (crater)|Aristarchus plateau]].

A few of the more famous historical accounts of transient phenomena include the following:

* On June 18, 1178, five or more monks from [[Canterbury]] reported an upheaval on the Moon shortly after sunset. "There was a bright new moon, and as usual in that phase its horns were tilted toward the east; and suddenly the upper horn split in two. From the midpoint of this division a flaming torch sprang up, spewing out, over a considerable distance, fire, hot coals, and sparks. Meanwhile the body of the moon which was below writhed, as it were, in anxiety, and, to put it in the words of those who reported it to me and saw it with their own eyes, the moon throbbed like a wounded snake. Afterwards it resumed its proper state. This phenomenon was repeated a dozen times or more, the flame assuming various twisting shapes at random and then returning to normal. Then after these transformations the moon from horn to horn, that is along its whole length, took on a blackish appearance." This description appears outlandish perhaps due to lacking public understanding of astronomical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jack B. Hartung | title=Was the Formation of a 20-km Diameter Impact Crater on the Moon Observed on June 18, 1178? |date=1976 | journal = Meteoritics | volume = 11 |pages =  187–194 | bibcode=1976Metic..11..187H | doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.1976.tb00319.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A993297 | title =  The Giordano Bruno Crater|publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Jack Hartung proposed that this described the formation of the [[Giordano Bruno crater]]. However, more recent studies suggest that it appears very unlikely the 1178 event was related to the formation of Crater Giordano Bruno, or was even a true transient lunar phenomenon at all. The millions of tons of lunar debris ejected from an impact large enough to leave a 22-km-wide crater would have resulted in an unprecedentedly intense, week-long [[meteor storm]] on Earth. No accounts of such a memorable storm have been found in any known historical records, including several astronomical archives from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Kettlewell, Jo (1 May 2001). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1304985.stm "Historic lunar impact questioned"]. BBC. Retrieved 13 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In light of this, it is suspected that the group of monks (the event's only known witnesses) saw the atmospheric explosion of a directly oncoming meteor in chance alignment, from their specific vantage point, with the far more distant moon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast26apr_1/ "The Mysterious Case of Crater Giordano Bruno"].

*During the night of April 19, 1787, the British astronomer Sir [[William Herschel]] noticed three red glowing spots on the dark part of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;Herschel, W.  (1956, May).  Herschel’s ‘Lunar volcanos.’  ''Sky and Telescope'', pp. 302-304.  (Reprint of ''An Account of Three Volcanos in the Moon'', William Herschel’s report to the Royal Society on April 26, 1787, reprinted from his Collected Works (1912))&lt;/ref&gt; He informed King [[George III]] and other astronomers of his observations. Herschel attributed the phenomena to erupting volcanoes and perceived the luminosity of the brightest of the three as greater than the brightness of a comet that had been discovered on April 10.  His observations were made while an [[aurora borealis]] (northern lights) rippled above [[Padua]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kopal | first1 = Z. |date=December 1966| title = Lunar flares | journal = Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets | volume = 9 | pages = 401–408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aurora activity that far south from the Arctic Circle was very rare. Padua's display and Herschel's observations had happened a few days before the number of [[sunspot]]s had peaked in May 1787.
*In 1866, the experienced lunar observer and mapmaker [[Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt|J. F. Julius Schmidt]] claimed that the [[Linné (crater)|Linné crater]] had changed its appearance. Based on drawings made earlier by [[Johann Hieronymus Schröter|J. H. Schröter]], as well as personal observations and drawings made between 1841 and 1843, he stated that the crater "at the time of oblique illumination ''cannot at all be seen''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. F. Julius Schmidt | title = The Lunar Crater Linne | journal = Astronomical Register | volume = 5 | pages = 109–110|date=1867 | bibcode=1867AReg....5..109S}}&lt;/ref&gt; (his emphasis), whereas at high illumination, it was visible as a bright spot. Based on repeat observations, he further stated that "Linné can never be seen under any illumination as a crater of the normal type" and that "a local change has taken place". Today, Linné is visible as a normal young impact crater with a diameter of about 1.5&amp;nbsp;miles (2.4&amp;nbsp;km).
*On November 2, 1958, the Russian astronomer [[Nikolai Aleksandrovich Kozyrev|Nikolai A. Kozyrev]] observed an apparent half-hour "eruption" that took place on the central peak of [[Alphonsus (crater)|Alphonsus crater]] using a 48-inch (122-cm) reflector telescope equipped with a [[spectrometer]]. During this time, the obtained spectra showed evidence for bright gaseous emission bands due to the molecules C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Kozyrev Observations of Alphonsus | last = Dinsmore Alter |journal = Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | volume= 71 |date=1959 | pages =46–47 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/PASP./0071//0000046.000.html | doi = 10.1086/127330 | first1 = Dinsmore | bibcode=1959PASP...71...46A}}&lt;/ref&gt; While exposing his second spectrogram, he noticed "a marked increase in the brightness of the central region and an unusual white colour." Then, "all of a sudden the brightness started to decrease" and the resulting spectrum was normal.
*On October 29, 1963, two Aeronautical Chart and Information Center cartographers, James Clarke Greenacre and Edward M. Barr,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenacre | first1 = J. A. |date=December 1963| title = A recent observation of lunar colour phenomena | journal = Sky &amp; Telescope | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 316–317 |bibcode = 1963S&amp;T....26..316G }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Lowell Observatory]], Flagstaff, Arizona, manually recorded very bright red, orange, and pink colour phenomena on the southwest side of Cobra Head; a hill southeast of the lunar valley [[Vallis Schröteri]]; and the southwest interior rim of the [[Aristarchus (crater)|Aristarchus crater]].&lt;ref&gt;Zahner, D. D. (1963–64, December–January).  Air force reports lunar changes.  ''Review of Popular Astronomy'', '''57'''(525), 29, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connell|first=Robert|author2=Cook, Anthony |title=Revisiting The 1963 Aristarchus Events|journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association|date=August 2013|volume=123|issue=4|pages=197–208|url=http://www.the1963aristarchusevents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event sparked a major change in attitude towards TLP reports. According to [[Willy Ley]]: "The first reaction in professional circles was, naturally, surprise, and hard on the heels of the surprise there followed an apologetic attitude, the apologies being directed at a long-dead great astronomer, Sir William Herschel."&lt;ref&gt;Ley, W. (1965).  ''Ranger to the moon'' (p. 71).  New York: The New American Library of World Literature, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; A notation by Winifred Sawtell Cameron states (1978, Event Serial No. 778): "This and their November observations started the modern interest and observing the Moon."&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, W. S. (1978, July). Lunar transient phenomena catalog (NSSDC/WDC-A-R&amp;S 78-03).  Greenbelt, MD: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center&lt;/ref&gt; The credibility of their findings stemmed from Greenacre's exemplary reputation as an impeccable cartographer, rather than from any photographic evidence.
*On the night of November 1–2, 1963, a few days after Greenacre's event, at the [[Observatoire du Pic-du-Midi]] in the French Pyrenees, [[Zdeněk Kopal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meaburn | first1 = J. |date=June 1994| title = Z. Kopal | journal = Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume = 35 | pages = 229–230 |bibcode = 1994QJRAS..35..229M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Rackham&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = P. | date = 2001 | title = Thomas Rackham, 1919–2001 | journal = Journal of the British Astronomical Association | volume = 111 | issue = 5| page = 291 |bibcode = 2001JBAA..111..291M }}&lt;/ref&gt; made the first photographs of a "wide area lunar luminescence".&lt;ref name="kopal"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0019-1035(63)90075-7 | last1 = Kopal | first1 = Z. | last2 = Rackham | first2 = T.

W. |date=March 1964| title = Lunar luminescence and solar flares | journal = Sky &amp; Telescope | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 140–141 |bibcode = 1964S&amp;T....27..140K }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[Apollo 11]] mission in 1969, Houston radioed to Apollo 11: "We've got an observation you can make if you have some time up there. There's been some lunar transient events reported in the vicinity of Aristarchus." Astronomers in [[Bochum]], West Germany, had observed a bright glow on the lunar surface—the same sort of eerie luminescence that has intrigued Moon watchers for centuries. The report was passed on to Houston and thence to the astronauts. Almost immediately, Michael Collins reported back: "Hey, Houston, I'm looking north up toward Aristarchus now, and there's an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area. It seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence." &lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine, Friday, Jul. 25, 1969 "A GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND"&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1992, Audouin Dollfus of the [[Paris Observatory|Observatoire de Paris]] reported anomalous features on the floor of [[Langrenus (crater)|Langrenus crater]] using a one-meter (3.2-foot) telescope. While observations on the night of December 29, 1992, were normal, unusually high [[albedo]] and [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] features were recorded the following night that did not change in appearance over the six minutes of data collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Audouin Dollfus | title =  Langrenus: Transient Illuminations on the Moon | journal = Icarus | volume = 146 | issue = 2|pages = 430–443 |date=2000 | doi = 10.1006/icar.2000.6395 | first1 = A | bibcode=2000Icar..146..430D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observations three days later showed a similar, but smaller, anomaly in the same vicinity. While the viewing conditions for this region were close to specular, it was argued that the amplitude of the observations were not consistent with a [[specular reflection]] of sunlight. The favored hypothesis was that this was the consequence of light scattering from clouds of airborne particles resulting from a release of gas. The fractured floor of this crater was cited as a possible source of the gas.

==Explanations==
Explanations for the transient lunar phenomena fall in four classes: outgassing, impact events, electrostatic phenomena, and unfavorable observation conditions.

===Outgassing===
Some TLPs may be caused by gas escaping from underground cavities. These gaseous events are purported to display a distinctive reddish hue, while others have appeared as white clouds or an indistinct haze. The majority of TLPs appear to be associated with floor-fractured craters, the edges of [[lunar mare|lunar maria]], or in other locations linked by geologists with volcanic activity. However, these are some of the most common targets when viewing the Moon, and this correlation could be an observational bias.

In support of the outgassing hypothesis, data from the [[Lunar Prospector]] [[alpha particle]] spectrometer indicate the recent outgassing of [[radon]] to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = S. Lawson|author2 = W. Feldman|author3 = D. Lawrence|author4 =  K. Moore|author5 = R. Elphic|author6 = R. Belian|last-author-amp = yes | title=Recent outgassing from the lunar surface: the Lunar Prospector alpha particle spectrometer | journal=J. Geophys. Res. | volume = 110 | pages=E09009|date=2005 | doi=10.1029/2005JE002433 |nopp = true|first1 = Stefanie L. | bibcode=2005JGRE..11009009L}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, results show that radon gas was emanating from the vicinity of the craters [[Aristarchus crater|Aristarchus]] and [[Kepler (lunar crater)|Kepler]] during the time of this two-year mission.  These observations could be explained by the slow and visually imperceptible diffusion of gas to the surface, or by discrete explosive events. In support of explosive outgassing, it has been suggested that a roughly 3&amp;nbsp;km- (1.9&amp;nbsp;mi-) diameter region of the lunar surface was "recently" modified by a gas release event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Nov06/MoonGas.html |author = G. Jeffrey Taylor | title = Recent Gas Escape from the Moon | publisher = Planetary Science Research Discoveries | date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = P. H. | first = Schultz | last-author-amp = yes |date=2006 | title= Lunar activity from recent gas release | journal= Nature |volume = 444 |pages = 184–186 | doi= 10.1038/nature05303 | pmid = 17093445 | last2 = Staid | first2 = M. I. | last3 = Pieters | first3 = C. M. | issue = 7116 | bibcode=2006Natur.444..184S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of this feature is believed to be about 1 million years old, suggesting that such large phenomena occur only infrequently.

===Impact events===
Impact events are continually occurring on the lunar surface. The most common events are those associated with [[micrometeorites]], as might be encountered during meteor showers. Impact flashes from such events have been detected from multiple and simultaneous Earth-based observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast30nov_1.htm | title=Explosions on the Moon | date=November 30, 2001 | author=Tony Phillips | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223053617/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast30nov_1.htm | archivedate=February 23, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =The Observation and Characterization of Lunar Meteoroid Impact Phenomena | journal =Earth, Moon, and Planets | volume =93 | issue =2 | pages =97–106 | date =2003 | doi =10.1023/B:MOON.0000034498.32831.3c | first1 =Brian M. | last1 =Cudnik | last2 =Palmer | first2 =David W. | last3 =Palmer | first3 =David M. | last4 =Cook | first4 =Anthony | last5 =Venable | first5 =Roger | last6 =Gural | first6 =Peter S. | url =http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/moon/2003/00000093/00000002/05252316;jsessionid=3hqgti6lb1k1n.henrietta | bibcode =2003EM&amp;P...93...97C | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140429053831/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/moon/2003/00000093/00000002/05252316;jsessionid=3hqgti6lb1k1n.henrietta | archivedate =2014-04-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lim"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/lunar/program_overview.html#link6 | title =  Lunar impact monitoring |publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/16may_lunarimpact/ |title=Bright Explosion on the Moon |publisher=NASA |date=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tables of impacts recorded by video cameras exist for years since 2005 many of which are associated with [[meteor showers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = 2005-06 Impact Candidates  | work = rates and sizes of large meteoroids striking the lunar surface.  | publisher = Marshall Space Flight Center | date = 5 September 2008 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/lunar/impact_candidates_05-06.html | accessdate = 2009-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, impact clouds were detected following the crash of ESA's [[SMART-1]] spacecraft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.esa.int/esa-mmg/mmg.pl?b=b&amp;type=A&amp;mission=SMART-1&amp;single=y&amp;start=2 | title = SMART-1 impact flash and dust cloud seen by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's [[Moon Impact Probe]] and NASA's [[LCROSS]]. Impact events leave a visible scar on the surface, and these could be detected by analyzing before and after photos of sufficiently high resolution. No impact craters formed between the [[Clementine mission|Clementine]] (global resolution 100 metre, selected areas 7-20 metre) and SMART-1 (resolution 50 metre) missions have been identified.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Electrostatic phenomena===
[[File:Seeing Moon.gif|thumb|right|Eight individual frames taken from a video of the lunar crater Clavius showing the effect of the Earth's atmosphere on astronomical images]]
It has been suggested that effects related to either [[electrostatic]] charging or discharging might be able to account for some of the transient lunar phenomena. One possibility is that [[electrodynamic]] effects related to the fracturing of near-surface materials could charge any gases that might be present, such as implanted [[solar wind]] or [[radiogenic]] [[daughter products]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Richard Zito | title = A new mechanism for lunar transient phenomena | journal = Icarus | volume  = 82 | issue = 2 | pages = 419–422 |date=1989 | doi = 10.1016/0019-1035(89)90048-1 | first1 = R | bibcode=1989Icar...82..419Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this were to occur at the surface, the subsequent discharge from this gas might be able to give rise to phenomena visible from Earth. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the [[triboelectric effect|triboelectric]] charging of particles within a gas-borne dust cloud could give rise to electrostatic discharges visible from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = David Hughes | title = Transient lunar phenomena | journal = Nature | volume = 285| issue = 5765 | pages = 438 |date=1980 | doi = 10.1038/285438a0| first1 = David W.|bibcode = 1980Natur.285..438H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, electrostatic levitation of dust near the [[lunar terminator|terminator]] could potentially give rise to some form of phenomenon visible from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/051207_moon_storms.html | title =  New Research into Mysterious Moon Storms | author = Trudy Bell | author2 = Tony Phillips  | last-author-amp = yes|date=December 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unfavourable observation conditions===
It is possible that many transient phenomena might not be associated with the Moon itself but could be a result of unfavourable observing conditions or phenomena associated with the Earth. For instance, some reported transient phenomena are for objects near the resolution of the employed telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere can give rise to significant temporal distortions that could be confused with actual lunar phenomena (an effect known as [[astronomical seeing]]). Other non-lunar explanations include the viewing of Earth-orbiting satellites and meteors or observational error.&lt;ref name="lim" /&gt;

==Debated status of TLPs==
The most significant problem that faces reports of transient lunar phenomena is that the vast majority of these were made either by a single observer or at a single location on Earth (or both). The multitude of reports for transient phenomena occurring at the same ''place'' on the Moon could be used as evidence supporting their existence. However, in the absence of eyewitness reports from multiple observers at multiple locations on Earth for the same ''event'', these must be regarded with caution. As discussed above, an equally plausible hypothesis for some of these events is that they are caused by the terrestrial atmosphere. If an event were to be observed at two different places on Earth at the same time, this could be used as evidence against an atmospheric origin.

One attempt to overcome the above problems with transient phenomena reports was made during the [[Clementine mission]] by a network of amateur astronomers. Several events were reported, of which four of these were photographed both beforehand and afterward by the spacecraft. However, careful analysis of these images shows no discernible differences at these sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = B. Buratti | author2 = W. McConnochie | author3 = S. Calkins | author4 = J. Hillier | last-author-amp = yes | journal = Icarus | title=Lunar transient phenomena: What do the Clementine images reveal? | volume=146 | pages=98–117 |date=2000 | doi=10.1006/icar.2000.6373 | first1 = B | bibcode=2000Icar..146...98B| url=https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/bitstream/2014/15049/1/00-1055.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not necessarily imply that these reports were a result of observational error, as it is possible that outgassing events on the lunar surface might not leave a visible marker, but neither is it encouraging for the hypothesis that these were authentic lunar phenomena.

Observations are currently being coordinated by the [[Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers]] and the [[British Astronomical Association]] to re-observe sites where transient lunar phenomena were reported in the past.  By documenting the appearance of these features under the same illumination and [[libration]] conditions, it is possible to judge whether some reports were simply due to a misinterpretation of what the observer regarded as an abnormality. Furthermore, with digital images, it is possible to simulate atmospheric spectral [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], astronomical seeing blur and light scattering by our atmosphere to determine if these phenomena could explain some of the original TLP reports.

The '''European Working Group on Vehicle Routing and Logistics Optimization''' (also, '''EWG VeRoLog''', or simply '''VeRoLog''') is a [[working group]] within EURO, the [[Association of European Operational Research Societies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro-online.org/ |title=EURO - The Association of European Operational Research Societies - Home |website=Euro-online.org |date=2012-07-10 |accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose objective is to promote the application of [[operations research]] models, methods and tools to the field of [[vehicle routing]] and [[logistics]], and to encourage the exchange of information among practitioners, end-users, and researchers, stimulating the work on new and important problems with sound scientific methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro-online.org/web/ewg/34/verolog-ewg-on-vehicle-routing-and-logistics-optimization |title=EURO - The Association of European Operational Research Societies - VeRoLog, EWG on Vehicle Routing and Logistics Optimization |website=Euro-online.org |date=2014-11-21 |accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verolog.eu |title=What is VeRoLog|website=Verolog.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
VeRoLog is one of the working groups of EURO, the [[Association of European Operational Research Societies]].  The Group was founded in 2011 by Daniele Vigo, Marielle Christiansen, Angel Corberan,  Wout Dullaert, Richard Eglese, Geir Hasle, Stefan Irnich,  Frederic Semet and Maria Grazia Speranza.		
								
==Governance==
The group is managed by a Coordinator and an Advisory Board including the founding members. The current coordinator is Daniele Vigo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://or.dei.unibo.it/staff/daniele-vigo |title=Daniele Vigo &amp;#124; Operations Research Group Bologna |website=Or.dei.unibo.it |date= |accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The group is suitable for people who are presently engaged in Vehicle Routing and Logistics, either in theoretical aspects or in business, industry or public administration applications. Currently (2015), the group has about 1,500 members from 67 countries.

==Conferences==
VeRoLog holds conferences on a regular basis (once a year during Summer) and issues every year an award to the best doctoral dissertation on vehicle routing and logistics optimization.

==Publications==
In most cases, the annual conference is followed by a peer reviewed special issue of an international journal, presenting a selection of the contributions presented at the meeting. Recent special issues appeared on ''[[European Journal of Operational Research]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03772217/236/3 |title=European Journal of Operational Research |volume=236 |pages=787–1008 |date=1 August 2014 |website=ScienceDirect.com |accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Computers and Operations Research''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03050548/55 |title=Computers &amp; Operations Research |volume=55 |pages=1–240 |date=March 2015 |website=ScienceDirect.com |accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in media''' are individuals who participate in media. Media are the collective communication outlets or tools used to [[Document|store]] and deliver information or data.&lt;ref&gt;What is media? definition and meaning http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/media.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What is Communication Media? – Definition from Techopedia http://www.techopedia.com/definition/14462/communication-media&lt;/ref&gt; The role of women in media evolves around the four axes of media: media [[Freedom of the press|freedom]], [[media pluralism]], [[media independence]], and media [[Safety of Journalists|safety]]. Women in media face the same difficulties and threats as men, but also experience [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]], safety issues, or under-representation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety of women journalists ==
{{Main|Safety of Journalists}}'''Safety of journalists''' is the ability for [[journalist]]s and media professionals to receive, produce and share information without facing physical or moral threats. Women journalists also face increasing dangers such as sexual assault, "whether in the form of a targeted sexual violation, often in reprisal for their work; mob-related [[sexual violence]] aimed against journalists covering public events; or the sexual abuse of journalists in detention or captivity. Many of these crimes are not reported as a result of powerful cultural and professional stigmas."&lt;ref&gt;The United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and Issues of Impunity, 2012, https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/un-plan-on-safety-journalists_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends Report in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threats on women journalists ===
[[Women in journalism|Women journalists]], whether they are working in an insecure context, or in a [[newsroom]], face risks of physical assault, [[sexual harassment]], [[sexual assault]], rape and even murder. Women journalists are vulnerable to attacks not only from those attempting to silence their coverage, but also from sources, colleagues and others.&lt;ref&gt;Lanza, Edison. 2017. Silenced Zones: Highly Dangerous Areas for the Exercise of Freedomof Expression. Office for the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Available at http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/expression/docs/publications/ZONAS_SILENCIADAS_ENG.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 global survey of nearly 1,000 journalists, initiated by the International News Safety Institute (INSI) in partnership with the [[International Women's Media Foundation]] (IWMF) and with the support of UNESCO, found that nearly two-thirds of women who took part in the survey had experienced intimidation, threats or abuse in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;International Media Women's Foundation and International News Safety Institute 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 2012 through 2016, UNESCO's Director-General denounced the killing of 38 women journalists, representing 7 per cent of all journalists killed.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/unesco-condemns-killing-of-journalists&lt;/ref&gt;  The percentage of journalists killed who are women is significantly lower than their overall representation in the media workforce. This large gender gap is likely partly the result of the persistent under-representation of women reporting from war-zones or insurgencies or on topics such as politics and crime.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Janet, Nick Mosdell, and James Griffiths. 2016. Gender, Risk and Journalism. Journalism Practice 10 (7): 902–916&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 2017 report of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] outlines a way forward for a gender-sensitive approach to strengthening the safety of women journalists.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly. 2017.

Available at https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N17/245/44/PDF/N1724544.pdf?OpenElement.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[Council of Europe]]’s Committee of Ministers adopted recommendation CM/Rec(2016)4 on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors, in particular noting the gender-specific threats that many journalists face and calling for urgent, resolute and systematic responses.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. 2016.

=== Online harassment of women journalists data ===
Research undertaken by [[Pew Research Center]] indicated that 73 per cent of adult internet users in the United States had seen someone be harassed in some way online and 40 per cent had personally experienced it, with young women being particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment and [[stalking]].&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, Maeve, Lee Rainie, Aaron Smith, Cary Funk, Amanda Lenhart, and Mary Madden. 2014. Online Harassment. Pew Research Center. Available at http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/10/22/onlineharassment/.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Online harassment of women journalists.png|thumb|Online harassment of women journalists, World Trends Report 2018]]An analysis of more than two million tweets performed by the [[think tank]] [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]] found that women journalists experienced approximately three times as many abusive comments as their male counterparts on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;Demos. 2014. Demos: male celebrities receive more abuse on Twitter than women. Demos. Available at https://www.demos.co.uk/press-release/demos-malecelebrities-receive-more-abuse-on-twitterthan-women-2/.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Guardian]] surveyed the 70 million comments recorded on its website between 1999 and 2016 (only 22,000 of which were recorded before 2006). Of these comments, approximately 1.4&amp;nbsp;million (approximately two per cent) were blocked for abusive or disruptive behavior. Of the 10 staff journalists who received the highest levels of abuse and ‘dismissive [[Internet troll|trolling]]’, eight were women.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Becky, Mahana Mansfield, Ian Anderson, Josh Holder, Daan Louter, and Monica Ulmanu. 2016.

The INSI and IWMF survey found that more than 25 per cent of ‘verbal, written and/or physical intimidation including threats to family and friends’ took place online.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Alana, and Hannah Storm. 2014.

[[Online hate speech|Countering online abuse]] is a significant challenge, and few legislative and policy frameworks exist on the international or national level to protect journalists from digital harassment.&lt;ref&gt;International Women's Media Foundation. 2016.

The [[International Federation of Journalists]] and the South Asia Media Solidarity Network launched the Byte Back campaign to raise awareness and [[Online hate speech|combat online harassment]] of women journalists in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;International Federation of Journalists. 2017.

The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) organized an expert meeting titled ‘New Challenges to Freedom of Expression: Countering Online Abuse of Female Journalists’ which produced a publication of the same title that includes the voices of journalists and academics on the realities of online abuse of women journalists and how it can be combated.&lt;ref&gt;Mijatović, Dunja. 2016. New Challenges to Freedom of Expression: Countering Online Abuse of Female Journalists. Edited by Becky Gardiner.

== Media freedom ==
'''Media freedom''' is the freedom to participate in media, the rights of expression, and access to and production of media content. These are all issues that can be fully understood only by considering their [[gender equality]] dimensions as they often overlap, and they have been compounded by the growing complexity of the digital sphere. Across all these issues, women do not enjoy full equality with men, nor do they have their work valued to the same extent as men. In many [[newsroom]]s around the world, there continues to be a culture that makes it difficult for women to progress. In such workplaces, [[harassment]] is common, and a lack of monitoring means that even with gender equality [[Policy|policies]] in place, they are often ineffective in challenging [[Sexism|gender discrimination]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Under-representation of women ===
A related challenge has been the absence of women's voices as an issue in media freedom, including in [[internet governance]] policy-making more generally. This ongoing issue appears to have stagnated in recent years. The [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF) Dynamic Coalition on Gender and Internet Governance, which pushes for recognition of the gendered issues relating to internet governance, reports that although women's participation at the 2015 IGF reached close to parity, women were still underrepresented in discussion and debates: only 37 per cent of panelists were women, a decline from 40 per cent the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Gender Dynamic Coalition and APC. 2016. Internet Governance Forum 2015: Learnings from the Gender Report Cards. GenderIT. Available at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.genderit.org/resources/internetgovernance-forum-2015-learnings-genderreport-cards&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In organizations, such as the Internet Association for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]), senior [[leadership]] positions remain largely dominated by men. In 2017, ICANN's board of directors consisted of four women and 16 men. Minimizing the divide between the number of women and men in senior decision-making roles in relation to internet governance is an important step to ensuring that gender-based issues relating to [[Access to information|access]], [[privacy]] and security are prioritized.&lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, Anja, Avri Doria, Bruno Zilli, Margarita Salas, and Women's Legal and Human Rights Bureau. 2012. Critically Absent: Women’s Rights in Internet Governance. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.genderit.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; resources/critically-absent-womeninternet-governance-policy-advocacytoolkit&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of prevailing inequality, [[civil society]] continues to be a force for progress. Other organizations are working to push for greater representation and key standard-setting bodies, such as the Gender and Internet Governance eXchange, initiated by the [[Association for Progressive Communications]], which aims to redress the gap in participation by women's and [[Sexual rights|sexual rights’ activists]] in internet governance policy processes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Freedom of information ===
Women's [[freedom of information]] and access to information is far from being equal to men's. It's the access to information gender divide. Social barriers such as [[Literacy|illiteracy]] and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities in navigating the tools used for access to information, often exacerbating lack of awareness of issues that directly relate to women and gender, such as [[Reproductive health|sexual health]]. There have also been examples of more extreme measures, such as local community authorities banning or restricting mobile phone use for girls and unmarried women in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, Anja. 2017. ‘Chupke, Chupke’: Going Behind the Mobile Phone Bans in North India. Internet Democracy Project. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://genderingsurveillance&lt;/nowiki&gt;. internetdemocracy.in/phone_ban/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of States, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the [[LGBT]]QI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;York, Jillian C. 2016. The State of Free Expression Online in Southeast Asia. Electronic Frontier Foundation. Available at &lt;https:// www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/statefree-expression-online-southeast-asia&gt;. Accessed 4 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as YouTube’s 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQ themes as ‘restricted’, a classification designed to filter out ‘potentially inappropriate content’.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Elle. 2017. LGBT community anger over YouTube restrictions which make their videos invisible. The Guardian. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt; technology/2017/mar/20/lgbt-communityanger-over-youtube-restrictions-whichmake-their-videos-invisible&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online activity ===
Gendered aspects of [[media freedom]] intersect heavily with [[Safety of Journalists|journalists’ safety]]. [[Women in journalism|Women journalists]] face unique concerns, such as personal safety when dealing with confidential [[Journalism source protection|sources]], which can restrict their freedom of expression and add challenges that can hamper their ability to carry. Another dimension is the manifestation of physical violence as virtual violence through the increased incidence of [[Online hate speech|hate speech]] and abuse directed towards women and the LGBTQI community. Such abuse has had a chilling effect and disrupted the [[online participation]] of these communities. Countering the proliferation of such abuse has proved a serious challenge for policy-makers wanting to minimize the harm directed towards vulnerable groups. To mark [[International Women's Day]] in 2017, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression noted the challenges for [[government]]s, corporate bodies and [[Non-governmental organization|civil society organizations]] to address such abuses while remaining attentive to [[international human rights law]]. He counseled against censorship and undue restrictions on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] as a means of curbing [[Cyberbullying|online abuse]], warning that such restrictions could ‘end up undermining the rights of the very women for whom governments and corporate actors may seek to provide redress’.&lt;ref&gt;OHCHR. 2017. UN experts urge States and companies to address online genderbased abuse but warn against censorship&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media pluralism ==
Media pluralism is evaluated in terms of [[Access to information|access]], plurality of economic models and diversity of content. [[Gender equality]] in decision-making roles, the media workforce and representation in the media has not yet been reached in any of these areas according to [[UNESCO]]'s World Trends Report.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

=== Background ===
In the mid-1970s, pioneering academics made the first systematic analysis of women's relationship to and visibility in the mass media and in their ground-breaking study, they used the term ‘[[symbolic annihilation]]’ (originally credited to [[George Gerbner]]) to describe what they found.&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, Gaye, A.K. Daniels, and J Benoit. 1978. Hearth and Home: Images of Women the Mass Media. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Available at &lt;Tuchman, G., Daniels, A.K., and Benoit, J. (1978) Hearth and Home: Images of Women in the Mass Media: Oxford: Oxford University Press.&gt;. Accessed 25 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost 40 years later, most gender and media scholars would suggest that progress has stalled, and there is significant work left to be done, including in relation to [[mainstream media]]. Women still feature less frequently than men in news discourse; women journalists and media professionals are often locked out of the more prestigious beats, and their occupation of senior positions within media organizations is still minimal. According to the [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring]] Report in 2015 women made up only one in four media decision-makers, one in three reporters and one in five experts interviewed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Women's visibility in newspaper, television and radio increased by only seven percentage points between 1995 (17 per cent) and 2015 (24 per cent).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Macharia, Sarah. 2015. Who Makes the News? Global Media Monitoring Project 2015. London, Toronto: World Association for Christian Communication (WACC). Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://cdn.agilitycms&lt;/nowiki&gt;. com/who-makes-the-news/Imported/ reports_2015/global/gmmp_global_ report_en.pdf&gt;. Accessed 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The opportunities afforded to ‘ordinary’ citizens by the creation of [[Alternative media|alternative online news]] platforms has meant, however, that women's voices and perspectives are finding expression via these informal media channels.

=== International recognition ===
The existence of problems regarding gender and media pluralism has also been recognized by regional and [[international organization]]s and agencies over several decades. In 2010, UNESCO developed a comprehensive set of Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media, aimed at encouraging media organizations to benchmark themselves against equality criteria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/gender-sensitive-indicators-for-media-framework-of-indicators-to-gauge-gender-sensitivity-in-media-operations-and-content/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Council of the European Parliament adopted the recommendation made by the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]], that the media industry should adopt and implement gender equality indicators relating to women in decision-making, gender equality policies and women on boards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2013-0074+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 60th session of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]] in 2016, United Nations (UN) Women launched a new partnership with major media organizations to draw attention to and act on the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 agenda for sustainable development]], which aims to eradicate all forms of inequality.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[UN Women]] launched ‘Step it Up for Gender Equality’, which had the tagline of ‘Planet 50:50 by 2030’. At the launch of that initiative, 70 nations committed to the gender equality agenda, and two years later, that number had increased to 93. In 2016, a review by UN Women of actions taken by these pledging nations reported a large number of initiatives, although none of them explicitly mentioned the media. Yet despite these initiatives, women remain excluded or marginalized in the media on the one hand, or else stereotyped and [[Minimisation (psychology)|trivialized]] on the other. Longitudinal studies of women and news predict that this is unlikely to change soon. At the current pace of change, parity of visibility between women and men is unlikely to occur for another 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;Macharia, Sarah. 2015. Who Makes the News? Global Media Monitoring Project 2015. London, Toronto: World Association for Christian Communication (WACC). Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://cdn.agilitycms&lt;/nowiki&gt;. com/who-makes-the-news/Imported/ reports_2015/global/gmmp_global_ report_en.pdf&gt;. Accessed 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Step it Up for Gender Equality Media Compact comprises a coalition of media outlets from around the globe and from diverse sectors who have committed themselves to focusing on gender equality in three main ways: in their reporting routines, by disrupting [[stereotype]]s and biases; by increasing the number of women in their organizations, including in leadership and decision-making roles; and in developing gender-sensitive corporate practices. At its launch, 39 media houses had already signed up as founding members of the Compact and although each will devise their own internal agenda, being a member of the Compact requires a minimum set of actions to be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/en/get-involved/step-it-up/media-compact&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender equality in the media workforce ===
In many countries, as many women as men are graduating from media, journalism and communication degree programmes and entering the industry.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Byerly, Carolyn M. 2011. Global Report on Status of Women in News Media. Washington D. C.: International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF). Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www&lt;/nowiki&gt;. iwmf.org/our-research/global-report/&gt;. Accessed 8 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, when the first substantial analysis of women media professionals across 43 nations was produced, women constituted around 40 per cent of the media [[workforce]].&lt;ref&gt;National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch). 1995. Global Media Monitoring Project: Women’s Participation in the News. National Watch on Images of Women in the Media (MediaWatch).&lt;/ref&gt;  Women are encouraged not to go into ‘hard’ news beats and instead are channeled into areas of news that are allegedly of more ‘interest’ to women and are also commonly held as being less prestigious. A [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Monitoring Project]] (Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP)) 2015 report found that 31 per cent of stories on politics and 39 per cent of stories about the economy have female by-lines.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;The Global Media Monitoring Project is the longest-running longitudinal and global study of gender and news media and provides a snapshot of how women and men feature in, make and report the news on one day every five years. The first GMMP report was in 1995 and the most recent one (in 2015) published its findings in November 2015. The Project provides comparative data across time and region. Teams in 114 countries who monitored 22,136 stories published, broadcast or tweeted by 2,030 distinct media outlets carried out the 2015 report. In sum, data were collected on the work of 26,010 journalists and the representation of 45,402 individuals who featured in or were quoted in the stories.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories about politics and crime see the least number of women reporters across all regions with the exception of Asia and Latin America. Unlike men, even when women do work on ‘hard’ news stories, they often struggle to achieve visibility for their copy: just over a third (37 per cent) of stories in newspapers, television and radio [[News broadcasting|newscasts]] had a female by-line or were visibly or audibly reported by women, the same as in GMMP's 2005 study. More focused individual country analyses show exactly the same trends; for example, research from the United States shows that while women journalists are writing on a wider range of topics, they are still a minority of [[columnist]]s at the major dailies.&lt;ref&gt;Harp, Dustin, Ingrid Bachmann, and Jaime Loke. 2014. Where are the women? The presence of female columnists in US opinion pages. Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly 91 (2): 289–307.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of presenting on broadcast news, the 2015 [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]] found that the global proportion of women was 49 per cent, the same as in 2000 and two percentage points below the 1995 finding. Since 2005, the number of women working as reporters in broadcast news has dropped by four percentage points in television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;http://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp/gmmp-reports/gmmp-2015-reports&lt;/ref&gt;

Closer analysis from the [[World Trends report]] shows that women were more numerous on television (57 per cent) and less numerous on radio (41 per cent), where ‘looks’ are obviously far less important. The majority of younger presenters were women, but that trend reversed for older presenters, nearly all of whom were men. There were almost no women reporters recorded as older than 65.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Women's Media Center]] (WMC) 2017 report on women and the media in the United States shows a picture that has little changed from the GMMP's latest findings or indeed, from findings of its own previous studies. At 20 of the nation's top news outlets, women produced 37.7 per cent of news reports, an increase of 0.4 percentage points compared to 2016.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Women's Media Center. 2017. The Status of Women in U.S. Media 2017. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.womensmediacenter.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt; pages/the-status-of-women-in-u.s.media-2017&gt;. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  In broadcast news, women’s presence as anchors, reporters and field journalists actually declined by nearly seven percentage points between 2015 and 2016. The WMC study found that these gender-based disparities existed across all news media as much in newspapers, online news, wire services as broadcast, but were especially stark in television news.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The digital world is as likely to perpetuate the same gender divisions that exist in the off-line world as the opposite. There is little evidence to suggest that [[digital media]] are employing or promoting more women than other parts of the [[media ecology]]. The [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|GMMP]]’s latest findings suggest that women's visibility as both citizens and media professionals in [[Online newspaper|online news sites]] and Twitter feeds was 26 per cent, only two percentage points higher than for television, radio and print. The situation behind the scenes at large internet companies, which hold influence over which news content is presented most visibly and are responsible for moderation of discussion and comments, has been equally dire.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Women and decision-making ===
The challenge for many women is much more than just breaking into the industry, but also being able to advance to the highest levels in their careers. The Global Report on the Status of Women in the News Media found that women in media occupied just over a quarter of the jobs in top management (27 per cent) and [[governance]] (26 per cent) positions.&lt;ref&gt;Byerly 2011. The largest recent study of women media professionals, this report, which was researched for the International Women's Media Foundation and supported by UNESCO, looked at 59 countries and 522 news outlets.&lt;/ref&gt; The regions that fared best for women representation were [[Central Europe|Central]] (33 per cent) and Eastern Europe (43 per cent) and the [[Nordic countries]] (36 per cent). Elsewhere, women comprised only about a fifth of governance positions and held less than 10 per cent of top management jobs in Asia and the Pacific region. A major European project funded by the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE) found very similar findings. Men held most of the senior management positions and board membership in 99 media houses across the [[European Union]]. Public sector organizations were more likely to recruit and promote women into senior positions than private sector media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). 2017.

In the Asia and Pacific region, a joint report by the UNESCO Office in [[Bangkok]], UN Women and the [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) Asia Pacific&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Bangkok Office, UN Women and International Federation of Journalists 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; found women were significantly under-represented in decision-making roles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Southern Africa, a Gender Links study found that women constitute 40 per cent of media employees and 34 per cent of media managers.&lt;ref&gt;Ndlovu, Sikhonzile, and Tarisai Nyamweda. 2016. Whose news, whose views? Southern Africa Gender and Media Progress Study 2015. Johannesburg: Gender Links. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://genderlinks.org.za/shop/whosenews-whose-views/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;. Accessed 19 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The study also revealed that sexual harassment remains a key issue for women: just under 20 per cent of women media professionals said that they had personal experience of sexual harassment and the majority of those women said that the perpetrator was a senior colleague.

For Mary Kosut, women remain vastly underrepresented as media owners, a trend that has continued unabated as media concentration has increased through media consolidation and convergence.&lt;ref&gt;Kosut, Mary, ed. 2012. Encyclopedia of Gender in Media. SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender and representation ===
Many feminist media scholars have argued that what we see in front of the camera is determined to some extent by who is behind the camera and there is some reason to believe that more women in the newsroom would produce news that is more diverse. Several studies, including the [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]] (GMMP), show that women journalists are more likely to source women in their stories than men, leading to more balanced reporting which is better able to reflect the views of more and diverse communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The 2015 GMMP was able to make comparisons across the 20 years in which it has been operating. Despite women's considerable advancement over the past two decades in the public and [[private sector]]s, female appearances in television, radio and print rose by only seven percentage points between 1995 (17 per cent) and 2015 (24 per cent). Where women most often appear in media, it is when they speak from personal experience (representing 38 per cent), while only 20 per cent of [[spokesperson]]s and 19 per cent of experts featured in stories are women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The underepresentation of women in media content extends across regions. Women featured in stories as 32 per cent of experts interviewed in North America, followed by the Caribbean (29 per cent) and Latin America (27 per cent). In the southern African region, Gender Links’ latest Gender and Media Progress Study covered 14 countries and found that women's views and voices accounted for a mere 20 per cent of news sources across Southern Africa media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Sarah Macharia, even if more women appear in media, there may be limited impact on the entrenched biases and stereotypes present in media content. This can promote narrow gender roles that limit the choices and options available to everyone. This is why many actors continue to encourage all media workers to become more gender-sensitive through training and internal [[Policy|policies]] that monitor coverage and promote greater awareness of gender issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The picture for women in media ===
Women's accomplishments in the media sector have long remained under-recognized by traditional professional and news organizations, a trend that remains unchanged. Women have won only a quarter of [[Pulitzer Prize]]s for foreign reporting and only 17 per cent of awards of the [[Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Asquith, Christina. 2016. Why Don't Female Journalists Win More Awards? – The Atlantic. The Atlantic. Available at &lt;https:// www.theatlantic.com/international/ archive/2016/03/women-foreigncorrespondents/472596/&gt;. Accessed 25 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of organizations, mostly gender focused, have launched dedicated prizes to recognize achievements of women in media. The [[International Women's Media Foundation]] continues to recognize the courageous work of women journalists. In 2007, the [[Alliance of Women Film Journalists]]’ began giving out the EDA Awards annually to recognize women filmmakers and [[Photojournalism|photojournalists]]. More recently, in 2015 the [[African Development Bank]] began sponsoring a category for [[Women's rights]] in Africa, designed to promote gender equality through the media, as one of the prizes awarded annually by [[One World Media]].&lt;ref&gt;African Development Bank. 2015.

Accessed 25 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In considering the way in which women’s contribution to the news environment is made visible, the [[UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize]] is an annual award that honors a person, organization or institution that has made a notable contribution to the defense and/or promotion of press freedom anywhere in the world. Nine out of 20 winners have been women.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/prizes/guillermo-cano&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poynter Institute]] since 2014 has been running a Leadership Academy for Women in Digital Media, expressly focused on the skills and knowledge needed to achieve success in the digital media environment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.poynter.org/training-events/leadership-academy-women-digital-media&lt;/ref&gt; Similar initiatives have begun to appear in other regions. UNESCO has also led workshops media professionals and community media in Gabon and Burundi, as part of its global efforts to enhance gender equality in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Kenmoe, Elvis Michel. 2016.

== Media independence ==
'''Media independence''' is the capacity of a news outlet to provide accurate and [[Bias|unbiased]] information to the public. In a 2016 study of board members’ views in North America and Western Europe on the introduction of quotas, for example, individuals whose organizations (and countries) were committed to actions to increase women's representation were enthusiastic about the effects; but in contrast, individuals working in contexts without such commitments were rarely keen to embrace such strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Wiersema and Mors, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addressing issues around gender and media independence, a number of advocacy and media monitoring initiatives have developed over the past few years that provide data on persistent gender inequalities. Media unions at local, national, regional and global levels have been prominent in working to protect the interests of women media workers, initiating women's [[caucus]]es, appointing women's officers, establishing women's conferences and developing handbooks of good practice. [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ), for example, has a Gender Council (GC) which co-ordinates its gender-focused work. Since its inception, the GC has been IFJ's main vehicle to guide projects; formulate policy concerning gender and good practice; and advocate for and mainstream gender-based issues throughout IFJ, its projects and its member unions.  During its 2016 Congress, the work of the GC was officially enshrined and protected through inclusion in the IFJ Constitution. Women media professionals themselves have also been active in forming their own networks to support and encourage each other, organizing events, developing mentoring schemes and initiating awards that recognize women's accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;International Federation of Journalists. 2017. Byte Back: IFJ launches guide to combat cyber harassment in South Asia.

=== Gender equality in the media workplace ===
Research over the past two decades on the working conditions of women media professionals has mostly shown that women sometimes face hostility in the [[newsroom]], which can be partly explained by the lack of organizational policies relating to gender equality and reporting mechanisms for [[harassment]]. The [[International Women's Media Foundation]]’s 2011 global study of women in the news media, cited in the previous chapter, found that more than half of the news media organizations surveyed had a company-wide policy on gender equality, but with significant variations between regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  More than two-thirds of organizations based in Western Europe and Africa had such policies, compared with a quarter in the Middle East and North Africa and less than 20 per cent in Central and Eastern European countries. The [[European Institute for Gender Equality]]’s 2013 report, which looked at 99 major media houses across Europe, found that a quarter of organizations had policies that included a provision for gender equality, often as part of broader equality directives in the society. It was notable that of the 99 organizations, public service bodies were much more likely than commercial ones to have equality policies in place. Media houses with such policies in place typically lacked mechanisms to monitor their effectiveness, thereby limiting their potential to effect change. The limitations of work practices to address gender inequalities do not reflect a lack of advocacy as there is evidence of a growing commitment towards gender equality on the part of media organizations.

=== Media monitoring and advocacy ===
In addition to the Global Media Monitoring Project, there are several regional initiatives which regularly monitor gendered aspects of the media, some of which also work with journalists to promote change within newsrooms.

The South Africa-based Gender Links, formed in 2001 to promote ‘gender equality in and through the media’ in Southern Africa, leads the media cluster of the Southern Africa Gender Protocol Alliance. Gender Links promotes media advocacy through global initiatives such as the Global Alliance on Media and Gender (GAMAG), hosting gender and media summits, developing policy in collaboration with regulators and working with media organizations through training and policy development. Gender Links is currently developing Centres of Excellence for Gender in the Media in 108 Newsroom across Southern Africa.

In 2016, the [[World Association for Christian Communication]] (WACC), the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) Network and other partners launched a campaign to end news media sexism by 2020. The ‘End News Media Sexism’ campaign encourages and supports advocacy initiatives that promote changes in media policies and journalism practice. The campaign is taking a multi-disciplinary approach and uses a variety of different tools to promote awareness, including a gender scorecard against which media organizations are measured.

The [[FEMNET|African Women's Development and Communication Network]] (FEMNET), founded in 1988 as part of a broader project to promote women's empowerment in Africa, prioritizes women's development in the field of communication, where they have created and managed platforms to share information, ideas, strategies and experiences to foster cross-learning and more effective implementation of shared goals. FEMNET provides strategic policy recommendations through the production of reports and policy briefs. It has led extensive local [[capacity building]] initiatives, such as facilitating women's access to [[Information and communications technology|ICTs]] in Africa. In Asia, the South Asia Women's Network (SWAN) has rolled out a research project titled ‘Women for Change: Building a Gendered Media in South Asia’. Covering nine South Asian countries, it is partly supported by UNESCO’s [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]].

In addition, a number of national organizations work locally to redress the disparity in women's representation and participation in the media. Women, Media and Development (known by its [[Arabic]] acronym TAM) is a Palestine-based organization founded in 2004. TAM works with local women to promote their increased representation in the media and to foster an environment where they are able to effectively communicate and advocate for their rights. TAM provides training for women on how to access and use various media platforms, in addition to promoting community awareness and advocacy initiatives. TAM has facilitated capacity building and worked to counter stereotypes of women in the media by producing gender sensitive guides and training manuals, in addition to implementing projects that aim to increase women's access to decision-making positions and [[Civic engagement|civic participation]].

=== Formal and informal professional associations ===
A number of formal and informal networks of women media professionals also support women in the media. One of the oldest is the [[Alliance for Women in Media]] (AWM), originally established in 1951 as American Women in Radio and television, which supports women across all media to expand their networks, participate in training and professional development and celebrate their talents.&lt;ref&gt;https://allwomeninmedia.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, it began its annual programme of awards to recognize the work of programme-makers and content-providers in promoting women and women’s issues. A more regionally focused example is the [[Marie Colvin]] Journalists’ Network, a bilingual Arabic-English online community of women journalists working in the [[Arab world]] that aims to assist vulnerable local [[Women in journalism|women journalists]] who lack support in relation to safety training, legal contracts, insurance or [[Psychology|psychological]] care.&lt;ref&gt;n.d. Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network. Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network. Available at &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://mariecolvinnetwork.org/en/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media unions at local, regional and global levels have established caucuses for women and have campaigned to encourage more women to stand for elected office within formal union structures. In 2001, the [[International Federation of Journalists]] found that women represented 29 per cent of union membership in 38 countries but just 17 per cent of members on union governing bodies: in its 2010 report, it found that women’s representation on boards had increased only slightly, to 15 per cent. In Europe, between 2006 and 2013, women’s union membership went down from 45 per cent to 42 per cent and board membership also declined, from 39 per cent to 36 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifj.org/press-room/publications-reports/browse/weiter/category/reports/&lt;/ref&gt;
