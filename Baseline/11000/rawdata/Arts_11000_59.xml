The year '''1967 in film''' involved some significant events. It is widely considered as one of the most ground-breaking years in film, with "revolutionary" films highlighting the change, including: ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', ''[[The Graduate]]'', ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'', ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'', ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'', and ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Mark|title=Pictures at a revolution : five movies and the birth of the new Hollywood|date=2009|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0143115038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
* The prototype for the [[IMAX]] large-format-film acquisition and screening system is exhibited at [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada
* The MPAA adopts a new logo, which is still used today.
* July 15 — [[Seven Arts Productions]] acquire substantially all the assets and business of [[Warner Bros.]] creating [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]]. 
* August 13 — ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', starring [[Warren Beatty]], [[Faye Dunaway]], and [[Gene Hackman]], premieres. It broke many taboos of its time, such as the visual depiction of violence. It has been considered a landmark film in Hollywood filmmaking, with its groundbreaking and ingenious visual styles. The success of ''Bonnie and Clyde'' helped bring forth the [[New Hollywood]] era, a period of artistic and commercial renewal.
* October 18 — [[Walt Disney]]'s production of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' premieres. It was the last animated feature film to be personally supervised by Disney before his death the previous year. It was also one of the last Disney films to be personally approved by him, along with ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]]'' and ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]''. The story's moral message of friendship, love, and trust have been embraced by critics and audiences worldwide. ''The Jungle Book'' is notable for its realistic character animation and voice casting. [[The Jungle Book (soundtrack)|The film's soundtrack]], which includes the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]]-nominated "[[The Bare Necessities]]", '"[[I Wan'na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)|I Wan'na Be Like You]]", "Trust in Me", and "[[My Own Home]]", also contributed to the film's enormous success. It would be the most successful animated film to be made by Disney until ''[[The Rescuers]]'', ten years later.
* December 21 — ''[[The Graduate]]'', starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] (in his acting film debut), [[Anne Bancroft]], and [[Katharine Ross]], premieres. It tells a story of an aimless young man, seduced and betrayed by an older woman, while falling in love with her daughter. The theme of an innocent and confused youth who is exploited, misdirected, seduced (literally and figuratively) and betrayed by a corrupt, decadent, and discredited older generation (that finds its stability in the film's keyword "plastics") was well understood by film audiences and captured the spirit of the times, in light of the  [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1963]] and the increasing turbulence in American society in the mid-to-late 1960s. Like ''Bonnie and Clyde'', ''The Graduate'' broke many well-established [[taboo]]s in American cinema, and represents a new era in groundbreaking achievements in filmmaking.

''[[The Born Losers]]'' was released in 1967 and earned $2.25 million in U.S. and Canadian rentals.&lt;ref&gt;"Big Rental Films of 1967," ''Variety,'' 3 January 1968, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was re-released in 1974 and by 1977 it had earned $12.5 million in U.S. and Canadian rentals &lt;ref&gt;"All-time Film Rental Champs", ''Variety'', January 4, 1978, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; with a reported total gross of $36,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1967/0BLOS.php|website=The Numbers|title=The Born Losers, Box Office Information|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refbegin}}{{note label|Jungle Book|nb1||The gross listed for ''The Jungle Book'' includes the 1978 re-release.

'''''A Single Man''''' is a 2009 American [[Drama (modern genre)|drama film]] based on the [[A Single Man (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Christopher Isherwood]]. It is directed by [[Tom Ford]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] and stars [[Colin Firth]], who was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for his portrayal of George Falconer, a [[depression (mood)|depressed]] [[Homosexuality|gay]] [[British people|British]] university [[professor]] living in [[Southern California]] in 1962.

The film premiered on September 11, 2009 at the [[66th Venice International Film Festival]], and went on the film festival circuit. After it screened at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival|34th Toronto International Film Festival]], [[The Weinstein Company]] picked it up for distribution in the United States and Germany. An initial [[Limited release|limited run]] in the United States commenced on December 11, 2009, to qualify it for the [[82nd Academy Awards]] with a [[Wide release|wider release]] in early 2010.&lt;ref name="Variety.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008654.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Weinsteins engage ''Single Man'' |accessdate=December 3, 2009 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Michael |last=Fleming |first2=Sharon |last2=Swart |date=September 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
On November 30, 1962, a month after the [[Cuban missile crisis]], George Falconer is a middle-aged English college professor living in Los Angeles. George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim, at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. He bends down to kiss his dead lover. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening.

George receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley, who projects lightheartedness despite her also being miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. At times, he recalls his sixteen-year-long relationship with Jim.

During the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter, who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos. That evening George meets Charley for dinner. Though they initially reminisce and amuse themselves by dancing, Charley's desire for a deeper relationship with George and her failure to understand his relationship with Jim angers George.

George goes to a bar and discovers that Kenny has followed him. They get a round of drinks, go skinny dipping, and then return to George's house and continue drinking. George passes out and wakes up in bed with Kenny asleep in another room. While watching Kenny, George discovers that he had fallen asleep holding George's gun, to keep George from committing suicide. George locks the gun away, burns his suicide notes and in a voiceover explains that he has rediscovered the ability "to feel, rather than think". As he makes peace with his grief, George suffers a heart attack and dies, while envisioning Jim appearing and kissing him.

== Production ==
Fashion designer [[Tom Ford]], as a first-time director, financed the film himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tom Ford: Design Director |first=Laura M. |last=Holson |date=December 2, 2009 |accessdate=December 3, 2009 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/fashion/03ford.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501193103/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/fashion/03ford.html |archivedate=May 1, 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film places emphasis on the culture of the 1960s; the production design is by the same team that designed AMC television's ''[[Mad Men]]'', which is set in the same era.

Retrieved October 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was shot in 21 days, according to "The Making of ''A Single Man''" on the DVD.

== Marketing controversy ==
An early theatrical poster for ''A Single Man'' featured a close-up shot of Colin Firth and Julianne Moore lying side by side, their arms and shoulders touching. This led to speculation that the work's gay content and themes were being deleted or diminished in its marketing materials to improve its chances of success with a wider audience. A new poster with Moore relocated to the background was issued. The film's original trailer placed more emphasis on the relationship between George and Jim but a re-cut trailer omitted a shot of George and Jim kissing while retaining a kiss between George and Charley.

Speaking of the controversy, Moore said that director Tom Ford expressed concern that the original poster made the film appear to be a romantic comedy and that he ordered that the poster be changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbook.com/film/julianne-moore-on-the-de-gaying-of-a-single-man/ |title=Julianne Moore on the De-Gaying of ''A Single Man'' |work=[[BlackBook]] |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Ford, noting he does not see the film in terms of gay or straight, said, "I don't think the movie's been de-gayed. I have to say that we live in a society that's pretty weird. For example, you can have full-frontal male nudity on HBO, yet in cinema, you can't have naked male buttocks. You can't have men kissing each other without it being considered adult content. So, in order to cut a trailer that can go into broad distribution in theaters, certain things had to be edited out. But it wasn't an intentional attempt to remove the gayness of the movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shapiro |first=Gregg |url=http://www.ebar.com/arts/art_article.php?sec=film&amp;article=704 |title=A singular man |work=Ebar |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Colin Firth said, "[The marketing] is deceptive.

The film has received an overall positive reception from critics, with most reviews singling out Colin Firth's performance. It currently holds an 85% "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 175 reviews, with the site's consensus being that "Though the costumes are beautiful and the art direction impeccable, what stands out most from this debut by fashion designer Tom Ford is the leading performance by Colin Firth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.rottentomatoes.com/m/1218217-single_man |title=''A Single Man'' (2009) |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Flixter |accessdate=December 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709014029/http://au.rottentomatoes.com/m/1218217-single_man/ |archivedate=July 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] has compiled an average score of 77 (generally favorable reviews) from 35 critic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/singleman |title=''A Single Man'' (2009) |work=Metacritic |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Phillips of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote "Some films aren’t revelations, exactly, but they burrow so deeply into old truths about love and loss and the mess and thrill of life, they seem new anyway"&lt;ref name="Ryll2014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Alexander Ryll |year=2014 |title=Essential Gay Themed Films To Watch, ''A Single Man'' |work=Gay-Themed-Films.com |publisher=Gay Essential |accessdate=December 22, 2014 |url=http://gay-themed-films.com/films-to-watch-a-single-man}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Mondello of [[NPR]] commented “An exquisite, almost sensual grief suffuses every frame of A Single Man.”&lt;ref name="Ryll2014" /&gt; Marc Savlov of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' wrote “Everything fits perfectly, from titles to fin, but most of all Colin Firth, who dons the role of George like a fine bespoke suit.”&lt;ref name="Ryll2014" /&gt;

Critics who liked the film include ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' film critic Nathan Rabin, who gave the film an A- score, arguing that "''A Single Man'' is a film of tremendous style wedded to real substance, and rooted in "Firth's affecting lead performance as a man trying to keep it together for one last day after his world has fallen apart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/a-single-man,36227 |title=''A Single Man'' review |first=Nathan |last=Rabin |date=December 10, 2009 |work=A.

He betrays very little emotion, and certainly his thoughts cannot be read in his eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091223/REVIEWS/912239995 |title=''A Single Man'' review |work=Chicago Sun-Times |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=December 23, 2009 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Animal Farm''''' is an [[allegory|allegorical]] novella by [[George Orwell]], first published in England on 17 August 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bynum |first=Helen |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |isbn=9780199542055 |title=Spitting Blood: The History of Tuberculosis |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cVih-ivuiiwC&amp;pg=PR13 |p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2015/08/17/12-things-you-may-not-know-about-animal-farm-for-17th-5317058/|title=12 Things You May Not Know About Animal Farm|newspaper=Metro|date=17 August 2015|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and then on into the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|Stalinist era]] of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/george-orwells-animal-farm-historical-context-pt-1-3/8177.html |title=GCSE English Literature – ''Animal Farm'' – historical context (pt 1/3) |website=[[BBC]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103211528/http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/george-orwells-animal-farm-historical-context-pt-1-3/8177.html |archivedate=3 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]],&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. "[[Why I Write]]" (1936) (''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1 – An Age Like This 1945–1950'' p.&amp;nbsp;23 (Penguin))&lt;/ref&gt; was a critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and hostile to Moscow-directed [[Stalinism]], an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Bowker, ''Orwell'' p.&amp;nbsp;224 ; Orwell, writing in his review of [[Franz Borkenau]]'s ''The Spanish Cockpit'' in ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'', 31 July 1937, and "Spilling the Spanish Beans", ''New English Weekly'', 29 July 1937&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal [[dictatorship]], built upon a [[cult of personality]] and enforced by [[great purge|a reign of terror]].  In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described ''Animal Farm'' as a [[satire|satirical]] tale against Stalin ("''{{lang|fr|un conte satirique contre Staline}}''"),{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} and in his essay "[[Why I Write]]" (1946), wrote that ''Animal Farm'' was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, "to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole".

The original title was ''Animal Farm: A Fairy Story,'' but U.S. publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946, and only one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime kept it. Other titular variations include subtitles like "A Satire" and "A Contemporary Satire".{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} Orwell suggested the title ''{{lang|fr|Union des républiques socialistes animales}}'' for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the [[Latin]] word for "bear", a [[Russian bear|symbol of Russia]]. It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union, ''{{lang|fr|Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques}}''.{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}}

Orwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the UK was in its wartime alliance with the Soviet Union and the British people and intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem, a phenomenon Orwell hated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bradbury, Malcolm]], Introduction, p.&amp;nbsp;vi, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historytoday.com/robert-pearce/animal-farm-sixty-years |title=''Animal Farm'': Sixty Years On |website=[[History Today]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108041135/http://www.historytoday.com/robert-pearce/animal-farm-sixty-years |archivedate=8 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; including one of Orwell's own, [[Victor Gollancz]], which delayed its publication. It became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickstein, Morris. ''Cambridge Companion to Orwell'', p.&amp;nbsp;134&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]]. It won a Retrospective [[Hugo Award]] in 1996 and is included in the [[Great Books of the Western World]] selection.

==Plot summary==
[[Old Major]], the old boar on the Manor Farm, summons the animals on the farm together for a meeting, during which he refers to humans as "enemies" and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called "[[Beasts of England]]".

When Major dies, two young pigs, [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] and [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], assume command and consider it a duty to prepare for the Rebellion. The animals revolt, driving the drunken, irresponsible farmer [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]], as well as Mrs. Jones and the other human caretakers and employees, off the farm, renaming it "Animal Farm". They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, "All animals are equal". The decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn.

Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of [[#Animalism|Animalism]]. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health.

Some time later, several men attack Animal Farm. Jones and his men are making an attempt to recapture the farm, aided by several other farmers who are terrified of similar animal revolts. Snowball and the animals, who are hiding in ambush, defeat the men by launching a surprise attack as soon as they enter the farmyard. Snowball's popularity soars, and this event is proclaimed "The Battle of the Cowshed". It is celebrated annually with the firing of a gun, on the anniversary of the Revolution. Napoleon and Snowball vie for pre-eminence. When Snowball announces his plans to modernize the farm by building a [[windmill]], Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away and declares himself leader.

Napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young pig named [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]], Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project.

Once Snowball becomes a [[scapegoating|scapegoat]], Napoleon begins to [[purge]] the farm with his dogs, killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who was nowhere to be found during the battle) frequently smears Snowball as a collaborator of Farmer Jones', while falsely representing himself as the hero of the battle. "Beasts of England" is replaced with an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man. The animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were under Mr. Jones.

[[Frederick (Animal Farm)|Mr. Frederick]], a neighbouring farmer, attacks the farm, using [[Explosive material|blasting powder]] to blow up the restored windmill. Although the animals win the battle, they do so [[Pyrrhic victory|at great cost]], as many, including [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer, the workhorse]], are wounded.

Despite his injuries, Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to purportedly  take Boxer to a veterinary surgeon, explaining that better care can be given there. Benjamin, the cynical donkey who "could read as well as any pig",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Orwell, George|date=1946|title=Animal Farm|location=London|publisher=Penguin Group|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; notices that the van belongs to a [[knacker]] and attempts a futile rescue. Squealer quickly assures the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital, and the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted.

In a subsequent report, Squealer reports sadly to the animals that Boxer died peacefully at the animal hospital. The pigs hold a festival one day after Boxer's death to further praise the glories of Animal Farm and have the animals work harder by taking on Boxer's ways.

However, the truth was that Napoleon had engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing Napoleon and his inner circle to acquire money to buy [[whisky]] for themselves. (In [[1940s]] England, one way for farms to make money was to sell large animals to a knacker, who would kill the animal and boil its remains into [[animal glue]].)

{{anchor|moreEqual}}
Years pass, the windmill is rebuilt, and another windmill is constructed, which makes the farm a good amount of income. However, the ideals which Snowball discussed, including stalls with electric lighting, heating, and running water are forgotten, with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives. In addition to Boxer, many of the animals who participated in the Revolution are dead, as is Farmer Jones, who died in another part of England.

The pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to a single phrase: '''''"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."'''''

Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name "The Manor Farm". As the animals outside gaze at the scene and look from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again, they can no longer distinguish between the two.

*'''The piglets''' – Hinted to be the children of Napoleon and are the first generation of animals subjugated to his idea of animal inequality.
*'''The young pigs''' – Four pigs who complain about Napoleon's takeover of the farm but are quickly silenced and later executed, the first animals killed in Napoleon's farm purge. Based on the [[Great Purge]] of [[Grigori Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]], and [[Alexei Rykov]].
*'''Pinkeye''' – A minor pig who is mentioned only once; he is the pig that tastes Napoleon's food to make sure it is not poisoned, in response to rumours about an assassination attempt on Napoleon.

===Humans===

*'''[[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]]''' – A heavy drinker who is the original owner of Manor Farm, a farm in disrepair with farmhands who often loaf on the job. He is an allegory of Russian [[Tsar Nicholas II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=| first=| url=http://www.shmoop.com/animal-farm/fall-mister-jones-russian-revolution-1917-symbol.html| title=The Fall of Mister Jones and the Russian Revolution of 1917| publisher=Shmoop University| accessdate=13 May 2013| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202221910/http://www.shmoop.com/animal-farm/fall-mister-jones-russian-revolution-1917-symbol.html| archivedate=2 December 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who abdicated following the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 and was murdered, along with the rest of his family, by the [[Bolsheviks]] on 17 July 1918.

The animals of Animal Farm are terrified of Frederick, as rumours abound of him abusing his animals and entertaining himself with [[cockfighting]] (a likely allegory for the human rights abuses of [[Adolf Hitler]]). Napoleon enters into an alliance with Frederick in order to sell surplus timber that Pilkington also sought, but is enraged to learn Frederick paid him in counterfeit money. Shortly after the swindling, Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm, killing many animals and detonating the windmill. The brief alliance and subsequent invasion may allude to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and [[Operation Barbarossa]].
*'''[[Pilkington (Animal Farm)|Mr. Pilkington]]''' – The easy-going but crafty and well-to-do owner of Foxwood, a large neighbouring farm overgrown with weeds. Unlike Frederick, Pilkington is wealthier and owns more land, but his farm is in need of care as opposed to Frederick's smaller but more efficiently-run farm. Although on bad terms with Frederick, Pilkington is also concerned about the animal revolution that deposed Jones, and worried that this could also happen to him.
*'''Mr. Whymper''' – A man hired by Napoleon to act as the liaison between Animal Farm and human society. At first he is used to acquire necessities that cannot be produced on the farm, such as dog biscuits and [[paraffin wax]], but later he procures luxuries like alcohol for the pigs.

===Horses and donkeys ===

*'''[[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]]''' – A loyal, kind, dedicated, extremely strong, hard working, and respectable cart-horse, although quite naive and gullible. Boxer does a large share of the physical labour on the farm. He is shown to hold the belief that 'Napoleon is always right'. At one point, he had challenged Squealer's statement that Snowball was always against the welfare of the farm, earning him an attack from Napoleon's dogs. But Boxer's immense strength repels the attack, worrying the pigs that their authority can be challenged. Boxer has been compared to the [[Stakhanovite movement]]. He has been described as "faithful and strong";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30047391|pages=17–19|last1=Sutherland|first1=T.|title=Speaking My Mind: Orwell Farmed for Education|volume=95|issue=1|journal=The English Journal|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40176954|pages=11–63|last1=Roper|first1=D.|title=Viewpoint 2: The Boxer Mentality|volume=9|issue=11|journal=Change|year=1977|doi=10.1080/00091383.1977.10569271}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Boxer is injured, Napoleon sells him to a local [[knacker]] to buy himself whisky, and Squealer gives a moving account falsifying Boxer's death.
*'''Mollie''' – A self-centred, self-indulgent and vain young white mare who quickly leaves for another farm after the revolution, in a manner similar to those who left Russia after the fall of the Tsar. She is only once mentioned again.
*'''Clover''' – A gentle, caring female horse, who shows concern especially for Boxer, who often pushes himself too hard. Clover can read all the letters of the alphabet, but cannot "put words together". She seems to catch on to the sly tricks and schemes set up by Napoleon and Squealer.
*'''[[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]]''' – A donkey, one of the oldest, wisest animals on the farm, and one of the few who can read properly. He is sceptical, temperamental and cynical: his most frequent remark is, "Life will go on as it has always gone on—that is, badly."&lt;ref name="Orwell 1946 40" /&gt; The academic Morris Dickstein has suggested there is "a touch of Orwell himself in this creature's timeless skepticism"&lt;ref name=Dickstein141&gt;''Cambridge Companion to Orwell'', p.&amp;nbsp;141&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed, friends called Orwell "Donkey George", "after his grumbling donkey Benjamin, in ''Animal Farm''."&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Orwell'', p.&amp;nbsp;236&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other animals===
*'''Muriel''' – A wise old goat who is friends with all of the animals on the farm. She, like Benjamin and Snowball, is one of the few animals on the farm who can read.
*'''The puppies''' – Offspring of Jessie and Bluebell, they were taken away at birth by Napoleon and reared by him to be his security force.
*'''Moses''' – The raven, "Mr Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker." Initially following Mrs Jones into exile, he reappears several years later and resumes his role of talking but not working. He regales Animal Farm's denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called "Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!" Orwell portrays [[Religion and politics|established religion]] as "the black raven of priestcraft—promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power." Napoleon brings the raven back (Ch. IX), as Stalin brought back the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=Dickstein141/&gt; 
*'''The sheep''' – They show limited understanding of Animalism and the political atmosphere of the farm; yet nonetheless they blindly support Napoleon's ideals with vocal jingles during his speeches and meetings with Snowball. Some commentators&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wgkz4 Professor Robert Colls (Cultural History, De Montfort University) BBC In Our Time's episode on Animal Farm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160929084512/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wgkz4|date=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; have compared the sheep to representations of state controlled press. Their constant bleating of "four legs good, two legs bad" was used as a device to drown out any opposition; analogous to simplistic headlines used in printed media of the age. Towards the latter section of the book, Squealer (the propagandist) trains the sheep to alter their slogan to "four legs good, two legs better", which they dutifully do, symbolizing the state manipulation of media.
*'''The hens''' – The hens are promised at the start of the revolution that they will get to keep their eggs, which are stolen from them under Mr Jones. However their eggs are soon taken from them under the premise of buying goods from outside Animal Farm. The hens are among the first to rebel, albeit unsuccessfully, against Napoleon.
*'''The cows''' – The cows are enticed into the revolution by promises that their milk will not be stolen, but can be used to raise their own calves. Their milk is then stolen by the pigs, who learn to milk them. The milk is stirred into the pigs' mash every day, while the other animals are denied such luxuries. 
*'''The cat''' – Never seen to carry out any work, the cat is absent for long periods and is forgiven; because her excuses are so convincing and she "purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; She has no interest in the politics of the farm, and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election, she is found to have actually "voted on both sides."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

==Composition and publication==

===Origin===
George Orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 subsequent to his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which he described in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938). In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of ''Animal Farm'', he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him "how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries". This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the [[Stalinist]] corruption of the original socialist ideals.{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}}

Immediately prior to writing the book, Orwell had quit the [[BBC]]. He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had put out. The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination.&lt;ref&gt;[[Overy, Richard]], ''Why the Allies Won'', p.&amp;nbsp;297 {{ISBN|0-393-03925-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the preface, Orwell also described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm:{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}}
{{quote
| ...I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.
}}

===Efforts to find a publisher===
Orwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published, largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Four publishers refused; one had initially accepted the work but declined it after consulting the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].{{sfn|Dag|2004|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;[[#GOIT|Orwell 1976 page 25 ''La libertà di stampa'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, [[Secker and Warburg]] published the first edition in 1945.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], it became clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch—including his regular publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. He also submitted the manuscript to [[Faber and Faber]], where the poet [[T. S. Eliot]] (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book's "good writing" and "fundamental integrity", but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint "which I take to be generally [[Deformed workers' state|Trotskyite]]". Eliot said he found the view "not convincing", and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue "what was needed... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs".&lt;ref name=Eliot/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09-004&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09|title=T.S. Eliot and Animal Farm: Reasons for Rejection|last=Eliot|first=Valery|date=6 January 1969|work=The Times|location=UK|accessdate=8 April 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015180725/http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09-004&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09|archivedate=15 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell let [[André Deutsch]], who was working for Nicholson &amp; Watson in 1944, read the typescript, and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson &amp; Watson would want to publish it; however, they did not, and "lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in ''Animal Farm''."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davison, editorial note, Orwell, Collected Works, ''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''London Letter'' on 17 April 1944 for ''[[Partisan Review]]'', Orwell wrote that it was "now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed. Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle."

The publisher [[Jonathan Cape]], who had initially accepted ''Animal Farm'', subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;—although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=337}} Writing to [[Leonard Moore (literary agent)|Leonard Moore]], a partner in the literary agency of Christy &amp; Moore, publisher Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information. Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable, and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive. It may reasonably be assumed that the 'important official' was a man named [[Peter Smollett]], who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent.&lt;ref name="Orwell Subverted p.3"&gt;''Orwell Subverted'', Daniel J. Leab, Penn State Press, 2007 p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka, and he would be one of the names Orwell [[Orwell's list|included in his list]] of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the Information Research Department in 1949. Born Hans Peter Smolka in Vienna in 1912, he came to Britain in 1933 as an [[NKVD]] agent with the codename 'Abo',&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Orwell'', p.&amp;nbsp;210; The Mitrokhin Archive, The KGB in Europe and the West, Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, p.&amp;nbsp;158&lt;/ref&gt; became a naturalised British subject in 1938, changed his name, and after the outbreak of World War II joined the Ministry of Information where he organised pro-Soviet propaganda, working with [[Kim Philby]] in 1943–45.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordievsky, Oleg]]. ''KGB: The Inside Story'', 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;325&lt;/ref&gt; Smollett's family have rejected the accusation that he was a spy.&lt;ref name="Orwell Subverted p.3"/&gt; The publisher wrote to Orwell, saying:&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;
{{quote |
If the fable were addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large then publication would be all right, but the fable does follow, as I see now, so completely the progress of the Russian Soviets and their two dictators [Lenin and Stalin], that it can apply only to Russia, to the exclusion of the other dictatorships.

Another thing: it would be less offensive if the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs. I think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people, and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy, as undoubtedly the Russians are.
}}

[[Frederic Warburg]] also faced pressures against publication, even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the heroic [[Red Army]],&lt;ref&gt;''George Orwell, A Personal Memoir'', T. R. Fyvel, p.&amp;nbsp;139&lt;/ref&gt; which had played a major part in defeating Hitler. A Russian translation was printed in the paper ''Posev'', and in giving permission for a Russian translation of ''Animal Farm'', Orwell refused in advance all royalties. A translation in Ukrainian, which was produced in Germany, was confiscated in large part by the American wartime authorities and handed over to the Soviet repatriation commission.&lt;ref&gt;[[Struve, Gleb]]. ''Telling the Russians'', written for the Russian journal ''New Russian Wind'', reprinted in Remembering Orwell, pp.260–61&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1945, Orwell wrote to Frederic Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] might illustrate ''Animal Farm''. Low had written a letter saying that he had had "a good time with ''ANIMAL FARM''—an excellent bit of satire—it would illustrate perfectly." Nothing came of this, and a trial issue produced by Secker &amp; Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned, but the [[Folio Society]] published an edition in 1984 illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]] and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist [[Ralph Steadman]] was published by Secker &amp; Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of ''Animal Farm''.&lt;ref&gt;Smothered Under Journalism, p. 123 &amp; I Belong to the Left, pp. 313–14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preface===
Orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British [[self-censorship]] and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally:
{{quote|The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary.... Things are kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervenes but because of a general tacit agreement that 'it wouldn't do' to mention that particular fact.}}
Although the first edition allowed space for the preface, it was not included,{{sfn|Dag|2004|p=}} and as of June 2009 most editions of the book have not included it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ba|Bailey83221]] (Bailey83221 includes a preface and two cites: 26 August 1995 ''The Guardian'' p. 28; 26 August 1995 ''New Statesman &amp; Society'' 8 (366): 11. {{ISSN|0954-2361}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Secker and Warburg published the first edition of ''Animal Farm'' in 1945 without an introduction. However, the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author's proof composited from the manuscript. For reasons unknown, no preface was supplied, and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute.&lt;ref name=GOIT15/&gt;&lt;ref name=TFOTP/&gt;

In 1972, [[Ian Angus (librarian)|Ian Angus]] found the original typescript titled "The Freedom of the Press", and [[Bernard Crick]] published it, together with his own introduction, in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 15 September 1972&lt;ref name=GOIT15/&gt; as "How the essay came to be written".&lt;ref name=TFOTP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crick/&gt; Orwell's essay criticised British self-censorship by the press, specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government.&lt;ref name=TFOTP/&gt; The same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 edition of ''Animal Farm'' with another introduction by Crick, claiming to be the first edition with the preface.&lt;ref name=GOIT15/&gt; Other publishers were still declining to publish it.{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=more details needed, were some actively refusing, unaware of the preface?}}

==Critical response==
Contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive.  Writing in the American ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' magazine, George Soule expressed his disappointment in the book, writing that it "puzzled and saddened me. It seemed on the whole dull. The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly." Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real world inspirations, and said, "It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/114852/1946-review-george-orwells-animal-farm|title=1946 Review of George Orwell's 'Animal Farm'|author=George Soule|work=The New Republic|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114001741/https://newrepublic.com/article/114852/1946-review-george-orwells-animal-farm|archivedate=14 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' on 24 August 1945 called ''Animal Farm'' "a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few".&lt;ref name="guardian19450824"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1945/aug/24/georgeorwell.classics|title=Books of the day – Animal Farm|work=The Guardian|date=24 August 1945|accessdate=17 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730154211/https://www.theguardian.com/books/1945/aug/24/georgeorwell.classics|archivedate=30 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tosco Fyvel]], writing in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' on the same day, called the book "a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us." [[Julian Symons]] responded, on 7 September, "Should we not expect, in ''Tribune'' at least, acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State—Soviet Russia? It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground. In a hundred years time perhaps, ''Animal Farm'' may be simply a fairy story, today it is a political satire with a good deal of point."

''Animal Farm'' has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, ''Collected Works, I Belong to the Left'', p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

===Animalism===
{{redirect|Seven Commandments|the Noahide code|Seven Laws of Noah}}

The pigs Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer adapt Old Major's ideas into "a complete system of thought", which they formally name Animalism, an allegoric reference to [[Communism]], not to be confused with [[Animalism (philosophy)|the philosophy Animalism]]. Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities associated with the humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading), which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments. Squealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation, an [[allusion]] to the Soviet government's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society.&lt;ref name=Rodden1999/&gt;
[[File:Animal Farm artwork.jpg|thumb|Squealer sprawls at the foot of the end wall of the big barn where the Seven Commandments were written (ch. viii) – preliminary artwork for a 1950 strip cartoon by [[Norman Pett]] and Donald Freeman]]

The original commandments are:
# Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
# Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
# No animal shall wear clothes.
# No animal shall sleep in a bed.
# No animal shall drink alcohol.
# No animal shall kill any other animal.
# All animals are equal.

These commandments are also distilled into the maxim "Four legs good, two legs '''bad!'''" which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm, often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of Animalism.

Later, Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking. The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded:
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No animal shall sleep in a bed '''with sheets.'''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No animal shall drink alcohol '''to excess.'''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No animal shall kill any other animal '''without cause.'''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Eventually, these are replaced with the maxims, "All animals are equal, '''but some animals are more equal than others'''", and "Four legs good, two legs '''better!'''" as the pigs become more human. This is an [[Irony|ironic]] twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political [[dogma]] can be turned into malleable [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name=Carr2010/&gt;

===Significance and allegory===
[[File:Animalism flag.svg|thumb|left|The Horn and Hoof Flag described in the book appears to be based on the [[hammer and sickle]], the Communist symbol.]]

Orwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written, "virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory." Orwell himself wrote in 1946, "Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution..[and] ''that kind'' of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters [-] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert."&lt;ref name=OrwellLIL334/&gt; In a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition, he stated, "...&amp;nbsp;for the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement. On my return from Spain [in 1937] I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages."&lt;ref&gt;Crick, Bernard. ''Orwell, A Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;450&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt of the animals against Farmer Jones is Orwell's analogy with the [[October Revolution|October 1917 Bolshevik Revolution]]. The ''Battle of the Cowshed'' has been said to represent the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|allied invasion]] of [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] in 1918,&lt;ref name="Peter Hobley Davison 1996" /&gt; and the defeat of the [[White movement|White Russians]] in the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Peter Edgerly Firchow 2008" /&gt; The pigs' rise to pre-eminence mirrors the rise of a Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR, just as Napoleon's emergence as the farm's sole leader reflects Stalin's emergence. The pigs' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use, "the turning point of the story" as Orwell termed it in a letter to [[Dwight Macdonald]],&lt;ref name=OrwellLIL334&gt;Orwell, George. ''A Life in Letters'', Penguin {{ISBN|978-0-141-19263-5}} p.&amp;nbsp;334&lt;/ref&gt; stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left-wing 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt revolt]] against the Bolsheviks,&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, Letter to Dwight Macdonald, 5 December 1946, ''A Life in Letters'', p.334 Penguin 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plans]]. The puppies controlled by Napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the Stalinist structure, and the pigs' treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;''Orwell Subverted'', 6–7 Daniel Leab, Penn State Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter seven, when the animals confess their nonexistent crimes and are killed, Orwell directly alludes to the purges, confessions and [[Moscow show trials|show trials]] of the late 1930s. These contributed to Orwell's conviction that the Bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the Soviet system become rotten.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Companion to George Orwell, p.&amp;nbsp;135, CUP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Edgerly Firchow]] and [[Peter Davison (professor)|Peter Davison]] consider that the ''Battle of the Windmill'' represents the [[Great Patriotic War]] ([[World War II]]),&lt;ref name="Peter Edgerly Firchow 2008" /&gt; especially the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Battle of Moscow]].&lt;ref name="Peter Hobley Davison 1996" /&gt; During the battle, Orwell first wrote, "All the animals, including Napoleon" took cover. Orwell had the publisher alter this to "All the animals except Napoleon" in recognition of Stalin's decision to remain in Moscow during the German advance.&lt;ref&gt;A Reader's Guide to George Orwell, Jeffrey Meyers, Thames &amp; Hudson, p.&amp;nbsp;142&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell requested the change after he met Joseph Czapski in Paris in March 1945. Czapski, a survivor of the [[Katyn Massacre]] and an opponent of the Soviet regime, told Orwell, as Orwell wrote to [[Arthur Koestler]], that it had been "the character [and] greatness of Stalin" that saved Russia from the German invasion.&lt;ref&gt;A Note on the Text, Peter Davison, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;xx&lt;/ref&gt;

Other connections that writers have suggested illustrate Orwell's telescoping of Russian history from 1917 to 1943&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Meyers, ''A Readers Guide to George Orwell'', p.&amp;nbsp;135. In the Preface to ''Animal Farm'' Orwell noted however, 'although various episodes are taken from the actual history of the Russian Revolution, they are dealt with schematically and their chronological order is changed.'&lt;/ref&gt; include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the Rebellion, which stands for the abortive revolutions [[Hungarian Revolution of 1919|in Hungary]] and [[German Revolution of 1918–19|in Germany]] (Ch IV); the conflict between Napoleon and Snowball (Ch V), paralleling "the two rival and quasi-Messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another: [[Trotskyism]], with its faith in the [[Permanent revolution|revolutionary vocation]] of the proletariat of the West; and Stalinism with its glorification of [[socialism in one country|Russia's socialist destiny]]";&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, quoted in Jeffrey Meyers, ''Readers Guide to George Orwell'', p.&amp;nbsp;138&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's dealings with Whymper and the Willingdon markets (Ch VI), paralleling the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|Treaty of Rapallo]]; and Frederick's forged bank notes, paralleling the [[Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union|Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939]], after which Frederick attacks Animal Farm without warning and destroys the windmill.&lt;ref name="Meyers, p. 141"/&gt;

The book's close, with the pigs and men in a kind of [[rapprochement]], reflected Orwell's view of the 1943 [[Teheran Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;Preface to the Ukrainian edition of ''Animal Farm'', reprinted in Orwell:Collected Works, ''It Is What I Think'' p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; that seemed to display the establishment of "the best possible relations between the USSR and the West"—but in reality were destined, as Orwell presciently predicted, to continue to unravel.&lt;ref&gt;''Orwell Subverted'', p.&amp;nbsp;7, Daniel J. Leab, Penn State Press 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The disagreement between the allies and the start of the [[Cold War]] is suggested when Napoleon and Pilkington, both suspicious, "played an ace of spades simultaneously".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Meyers, ''A Reader's Guide to George Orwell'' p.&amp;nbsp;142&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the music in the novel, starting with ''Beasts of England'' and the later anthems, parallels ''[[The Internationale]]'' and its adoption and repudiation by the Soviet authorities as the Anthem of the USSR in the 1920s and 1930s.

In addition to the book's political symbolism, some critics have argued that ''Animal Farm'' can also be read as a more straightforward story about farm animals, reflecting Orwell's concern for the treatment of animals.&lt;ref name="McHugh"&gt;Susan McHugh (2009).

==Adaptations==
===Films===
''Animal Farm'' has been adapted to film twice. Both differ from the novel and have been accused of taking significant liberties, including sanitising some aspects. 
*[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|''Animal Farm'']] (1954) is an animated feature in which Napoleon is apparently overthrown in a second revolution. In 1974, [[E. Howard Hunt]] revealed that he had been sent by the [[CIA]]'s [[Psychological Warfare]] department to obtain the film rights from Orwell's widow, and the resulting 1954 animation was funded by the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Martin Chilton |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/how-cia-brought-animal-farm-to-the-screen/ |title=How the CIA brought Animal Farm to the screen |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=21 January 2016 |accessdate=27 October 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026174651/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/how-cia-brought-animal-farm-to-the-screen/ |archivedate=26 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Animal Farm (1999 film)|''Animal Farm'']] (1999) is a TV live action version that shows Napoleon's regime collapsing in on itself, with the farm having new human owners, reflecting the collapse of Soviet communism.

In 2012, a HFR-3D version of ''Animal Farm'', potentially directed by [[Andy Serkis]], was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Giardina |first=Carolyn |title=Andy Serkis to Direct Adaptation of 'Animal Farm' |date=19 October 2012 |work=hollywoodreporter.com |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/andy-serkis-animal-farm-381314 |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113074010/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/andy-serkis-animal-farm-381314 |archivedate=13 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio dramatizations===
A BBC radio version, produced by [[Rayner Heppenstall]], was broadcast in January 1947. Orwell listened to the production at his home in Canonbury Square, London, with [[Hugh Gordon Porteus|Hugh Gordon Porteous]], amongst others. Orwell later wrote to Heppenstall that Porteous, "who had not read the book, grasped what was happening after a few minutes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davison, Peter (Editor)|title=The Lost Orwell|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further radio production, again using Orwell's own dramatisation of the book, was broadcast in January 2013 on BBC [[Radio Four|Radio 4]]. [[Tamsin Greig]] narrated, and the cast included [[Nicky Henson]] as Napoleon, [[Toby Jones]] as the propagandist Squealer, and [[Ralph Ineson]] as Boxer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01q7fzf|title=The Real George Orwell, Animal Farm|website=BBC Radio 4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127033407/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01q7fzf|archivedate=27 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage productions===
A theatrical version, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by [[Adrian Mitchell]], was staged at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] London on 25 April 1984, directed by [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]]. It toured nine cities in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Orwell, George|title=A Life in Letters|publisher= Penguin Books|date= 2011|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic strip===
In 1950 [[Norman Pett]] and his writing partner [[Don Freeman]] were secretly hired by the [[British Foreign Office]] to adapt ''Animal Farm'' into a comic strip. This comic was not published in the U.K., but ran in Brazilian and Burmese newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/pett_norman.htm|title=Norman Pett|author=|date=|website=lambiek.net|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171217014058/https://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/pett_norman.htm|archivedate=17 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5350">The '''Art In Embassies Program''' ('''AIEP''') is a public-private partnership that promotes cultural diplomacy through exhibitions, permanent collections, site-specific commissions and two-way artist exchanges in more than 200 U.S. Embassies and Consulates around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clinton|first1=Hillary|title=The Diplomacy of Art|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2013/02/hillary-clinton-art-embassies|website=www.vanityfair.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through art, international audiences gain a sense of the quality, scope, and diversity of American and host country art and culture. Initiated by [[President John Kennedy]] in 1963, the program is funded by the [[U.S. Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flamini|first1=Roland|title=Using art for diplomacy: A Vibrant State Department program reaches 50|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/dec/8/using-art-for-diplomacy-a-vibrant-state-department/?page=all|website=www.washingtontimes.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia Shore is the Chief Curator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nguyen |first1=Betty |title=Virginia Shore: Chief Curator, Art In Embassies: Excavation of Site and Citation |url=http://lacontemporary.org/virginiashore/ |accessdate=30 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231022433/http://lacontemporary.org/virginiashore/ |archivedate=31 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibition planning ==
The amount of money allotted for art in each building is calculated with a formula based on the gross square footage.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; AIEP's curatorial team develops thematic exhibitions in collaboration with each ambassador, taking into account the host country's artistic traditions and cultural mores. They recommend artists and works of art, negotiate all loans, and propose placement of the art within the embassy residences. After all loans are secured and the art insured, AIE's registrars coordinate with professional art handlers for the [[manufacturing|assembly]], [[Packaging and labeling|packing]], [[crating]] and safe [[shipment]] of each exhibition to post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Response to ABC 7 Questions on US Department of State's Art In Embassies Program|url=http://dig.abclocal.go.com/wls/documents/052114-wls-iteam-gov-spending-q&amp;a-doc.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1963, approximately 10,000 pieces of art have been placed in ambassador residences, embassies, and consulates throughout the world, including work by [[Maya Lin]], [[Jeff Koons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corcoran|first1=Joe|title=Art in Embassies Makes a Splash for 50th Anniversary|url=http://www.washdiplomat.com/DPouch/2013/January/story5artembassies.html|website=www.washdiplomat.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Martin Puryear]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Joel Shapiro]], [[Benjamin Abramowitz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = U.S. Department of State - Art in Embassies|url = http://art.state.gov/ArtistDetail.aspx?id=137324|website = art.state.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other prestigious artists.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Patricia|title=Employing Art Along With Ambassadors | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/27/arts/design/27embassy.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total value of art on loan to the embassy program is estimated at $200 million.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

== Artist exchanges / Residency programs ==
Initiated in 2002, the American Artists Abroad program was created to extend Art In Embassies' exhibitions beyond the walls of U.S. diplomatic residences into local communities. Participating American artists travel to countries where their work is exhibited and engage in a series of public cultural programming activities, such as lectures, workshops, and studio visits.

== Art collections by embassy ==

===Beijing===
The art in [[Embassy of the United States, Beijing|Beijing]] cost about $800,000 but has been appraised at $30 million. &lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; 

===London===
The program was criticized in 2013 when $1M was awarded for a sculpture at the [[U.S. Embassy]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2517666/US-State-Department-spends-1-MILLION-single-granite-sculpture-decorate-new-embassy-London.html&lt;/ref&gt; The project was subsequently scrapped because the sculpture was too heavy for the planned site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/state-department-scraps-million-dollar-granite-sculpture-us-embassy-london_882544.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the purchase of a $400,000 camel sculpture by artist [[John Baldessari]] was revealed in [[U.S. Department of State]] records obtained by the media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/04/01/state-department-to-spend-400000-for-camel-statue-in-pakistan/&lt;/ref&gt; United States Senator [[Jeff Flake]] raised concerns with this spending in a U.S. [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] hearing on April 21, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foreign.senate.gov/hearings/state-department-reauthorizaton-ensuring-effective-us-diplomacy-within-a-responsible-budget&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brett Murray''' (born 1961) is a South African [[artist]] mostly known for his [[steel]] and [[mixed media]] wall [[sculptures]]. He was born in [[Pretoria]], South Africa. Murray has a [[master's degree]] in fine art from the [[University of Cape Town|Michaelis School of Fine Art]], 1989.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Brett|title=Biography|url=http://www.brettmurray.co.za/biography/|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to by critic Brenda Atkinson as "the dark prince of South African pop (art)", Murray is one of the country's most popular artists, often using easily recognisable media images with the addition of a subversive and bitterly funny twist.&lt;ref name=ArtThrob&gt;{{cite web|title=Brett Murray|url=http://www.artthrob.co.za/sept98/artbio.htm|publisher=ARTTHROB|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray's work addresses the wars of the [[culture]]s, the clash between [[Afrocentrism]] and [[Eurocentrism]], the old and the new South Africas.  "With my work I hope to critically entertain. Through satirical and tragic reflections on South Africa, I hope to shift people's perspectives and change people's minds, indulgent, arrogant and pretentious as this might sound," he says.&lt;ref name=ArtThrob/&gt;  More recently, his work has explored his own personal experiences and identity. Murray was also the founder of the sculpture department at [[Stellenbosch University]].&lt;ref name="SA History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brett Murray|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/brett-murray|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defamation suit==
In 2012, Murray exhibited a painting in a [[Johannesburg]] gallery of former president [[Jacob Zuma]] with his genitals exposed, titled [[The Spear (painting)|''The Spear'']]. The painting was part of a show of political work entitled "Hail to the Thief II". On 18 May, the [[African National Congress]] announced its intention to sue him for defamation for the painting and to force the gallery to remove it from exhibition, its website, and printed materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18115724 |title=Jacob Zuma painting: ANC to sue South Africa's Brett Murray |date=18 May 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many public figures expressed outrage at the painting, and one church even called for Murray to be "stoned to death".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2012/05/23/church-digs-in-its-heels|title=TimesLIVE|website=www.timeslive.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday 22 May 2012, at 11am two men walked into the Goodman Gallery in [[Johannesburg]] with pots of paint and defaced ''The Spear''. They were caught on camera by a news team and were apprehended immediately by gallery security.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18159204 |title=Jacob Zuma painting vandalised in South Africa gallery |date=22 May 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the defamation debate, comparisons were drawn between Murray's ''The Spear'' and fellow South African [[Ayanda Mabulu]]'s work from 2010, ''Ngcono ihlwempu kunesibhanxo sesityebi''. The painting depicts Jacob Zuma in similar fashion alongside [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and other figures from the anti-Apartheid struggle - several sources questioned the potential racial and political motivations in Zuma's attack on Murray, a white artist.&lt;ref&gt;zuma portrait court case reopens South Africa's wounds from Apartheid era [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/24/spear-zuma-portrait-court-apartheid]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2689">'''Call boy''' (or '''call girl''') is the job title of a [[stagehand]] in the [[theatre]]. They are hired by either the [[theatre director|director]], [[theatrical producer|producer]] or stage crew chief. They report directly to the crew chief, are usually paid by the hour, and will sometimes rotate between several groups from one [[performance]] to the next.

==Primary roles==
The primary responsibility of the call boy or girl is to move from backstage to the dressing rooms and [[green room]]s alerting actors and actresses of their [[making an entrance|entrances]] in time for them to appear on stage on [[cue (theatrical)|cue]]. For example, they might call out, "You're on in five minutes, Miss Bernhardt."

The call boy or girl also calls the "quarter hour" and "overture and beginners",&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Bax|Bax, Peter]]. "The Dress Rehearsals". ''Stage Management''. Ayer Publishing. 1977. p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; the preparatory warning that signals for the [[orchestra]] to start the introductory music and the beginners, those performers who appear on stage at the beginning of the first act, to get into their opening positions. The call boy or girl also assists with scene changes.
==Etymology==
The term was already current at the end of the 18th century, when the Shakespearean scholar [[Edmond Malone]] claimed that [[William Shakespeare]]'s first job in the theatre was that of "call-boy".
==Notable people==
Usually actors themselves, they have historically taken roles and done crowd scenes as needed. The actor [[William J. Ferguson]] (June 8, 1845 – May 3, 1930) was the call boy at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], when actor [[John Wilkes Booth]] killed [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] and fled.&lt;ref&gt;"The Call Boy's Story". ''[[The New York Times]]''. Apr. 18, 1915. p. X 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson was described as the last surviving eye witness. He said he and actress [[Laura Keene]] were standing off stage at the first entrance, opposite the president's box, when it occurred. He heard the shot, looked up and saw Lincoln's head slump, then Booth jumped to the stage and rushed between him and Keene.

The term pretty much became obsolete in larger theatres in the mid-20th century, when most call boys were replaced by [[loudspeaker]]s placed in each dressing room and green room.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4804">A '''chief creative officer''' ('''CCO''') is the highest ranking position of the creative team within a company. Depending on the type of company, this position may be responsible for the overall look and feel of [[marketing]], [[Mass media|media]], and [[brand]]ing associated with the organization. The CCO may also be charged with managing, developing, and leading the team of [[creative director]]s, [[art director]]s, [[designer]]s, and [[copywriter]]s.

==Overall description==
The CCO directs a company's creative output, developing the artistic design strategy that defines the company's brand.&lt;ref name="do"&gt;Written By: Terry Masters, Edited By: Allegra J. Lingo [http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-chief-creative-officer-do.htm "What Does a Chief Creative Officer Do"], 14 October 2014, Retrieved on 30 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The CCO creates the unique image of the firm and deliver this distinctive design to consumers and to create a clear [[brand image]] which is a fundamental and essential work throughout the company. Advertisements present a certain memorable artistic design while also structured to accomplish functional goals. The CCO ensures that the design and functionality combine harmoniously so the firm can present a product that successfully represents its creative brand.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;

CCOs, in some cases are called [[creative directors]], are demanded in firms which involve creative thinking and artistic design. The position of generic head of marketing is usually replaced by chief creative officer in advertising firms.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt; The power of chief creative officer can even be compared to [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and at the early stages of a small company, usually at the start of [[partnerships]], the CCO and the CEO manage jointly.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3397">'''Childlore''' is the [[folklore]] or folk culture of [[children]] and young people. It includes, for example, [[rhyme]]s and games played in the school playground. The best known researchers of the field were [[Peter and Iona Opie]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The subject matter of childlore includes the traditions of children between the ages of about 6 and 15 such as games, [[riddles]], rhymes, jokes, pranks, [[superstition]]s, magical practices, [[wit]], [[lyrics]], [[Wiktionary:guile#Etymology|guile]], [[wiktionary:epithets|epithets]], nicknames, torments, [[parody]], oral legislation, seasonal customs, tortures, obscenities, codes, etc.&lt;ref name="Sutton"&gt;[[Brian Sutton-Smith|Sutton-Smith]] 1970:1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as individual activities such as solitary play, [[daydream]]ing, fantasies, imaginary companions and heroes, collections, scrapbooks, model worlds, comic reading, mass media interests, dramatizations, stories, art, etc.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt; 

As a branch of folklore, childlore is concerned with those activities which are learned and passed on by children to other children. The stories and games taught by adults to children are not considered childlore except insofar as the children adapt and make them their own. In western culture most folklorists are concerned with children after they join their peers in elementary school or kindergarten. The traditions of childhood generally stop after the child enters intermediate school, which coincides with puberty and adolescence.&lt;ref name="Grider"&gt;Grider 1980:159–160&lt;/ref&gt;

Opie and Opie demonstrate that the culture of children is quite distinctive and is as unnoticed by the sophisticated world, and quite as little affected by it.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Opie stated that the words of one game ([[Buck buck]]) had survived from the time of [[Nero]].&lt;ref name="Opie"&gt;Opie: 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The conservatism of childlore contrasts with the way adult folklore is rapidly modified to fit changing circumstances.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

{{Life in Cuba}}
'''Cuban art''' is an exceptionally diverse cultural blend of African, South American, European and North American elements, reflecting the diverse demographic makeup of the island. Cuban artists embraced European [[modernism]], and the early part of the 20th century saw a growth in Cuban [[avant-garde]] movements, which were characterized by the mixing of modern artistic genres. Some of the more celebrated 20th-century Cuban artists include [[Amelia Peláez]] (1896–1968), best known for a series of [[mural]] projects, and painter [[Wifredo Lam]] (Decembrer 8, 1902–September 11, 1982), who created a highly personal version of modern [[primitivism]]. The Cuban born painter [[Federico Beltran Masses]] (1885–1949), was renowned as a colourist whose seductive portrayals of women sometimes made overt references to the tropical settings of his childhood.  

[[Image:HavanaArtistsNeighborhood.jpg|thumb|left|In [[Centro Habana]], a small neighborhood of artists have transformed the walls around them. October 2002]]
Better known internationally is the work of photographer [[Alberto Korda]], whose photographs following the early days of the [[Cuban Revolution]] included a [[Che Guevara (photo)|picture of]] [[Che Guevara]] which was to become one of the most recognizable images of the 20th century.

There is a flourishing [[street art]] movement influenced by Latin American artists [[José Guadalupe Posada]] and the muralist [[Diego Rivera]].

After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, some artists felt it was in their best interests to leave Cuba and produce their art, while others stayed behind, either happy or merely content to be creating art in Cuba, which was sponsored by the government.  Because it was state sponsored, an implied censorship occurred, since artists wouldn't want to make art that was against the revolutionary movement as that was the source of their funding.  It was during the 1980s in which art began to reflect true uninfluenced expression.  The "rebirth" of expression in Cuban art was greatly affected by the emergence of a new generation of Cuban, which did not remember the revolution directly.&lt;ref&gt;Padura Fuentes, Leonardo. "Living and Creating in Cuba: Risks and Challenges". ''Reinventing the Revolution: A Contemporary Cuba Reader''. Ed. Philip Brenner et al. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2008. 348&amp;ndash;354. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Cubans saw the introduction of "Volumen Uno", a series of one man exhibitions featuring contemporary Cuban artists. Three years later, the introduction of the "Havana Bienal" assisted in the further progression of the liberation of art and free speech therein.&lt;ref&gt;Tonel, Antonio Eligio. "A Tree From Many Shores: Cuban Art in Movement". ''Art Journal''. 57.4 (1998) 62&amp;ndash;74. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial Era==
Throughout most of its 400 years under Spanish rule, Cuba and specifically Havana functioned as the primary entrepôt of Spain's empire in the Americas, with a population of merchants, administrators, and professionals who were interested in supporting the arts. In the 16th century painters and sculptors began arriving from Europe to decorate Cuban churches and public buildings. By the mid 1700s, native-born artists working in the European tradition were active in Cuba.&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt;&lt;ref name = CArt/&gt;
[[File:José Nicolás de Escalera - La Santísima Trinidad.JPG|thumbnail|left|''Yeyo Yeyo'', José Nicolás de Escalera, ca. 1770. Collection of the National Museum of Fine Art, Havana.]]
The first of these to leave a substantial, identifiable body of work was [[José Nicolás de la Escalera]] (1734 – 1804). Though mostly absent of originality, his religious scenes - particularly those decorating the cupola and altar of the Church of Santa María del Rosario near Havana - are spectacular, and include the first fine art depictions of Black Cuban slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuda Arte: José Nicolás de la Escalera; http://www.cernudaarte.com/artists/jose-nicolas-de-la-escalera/ retvd 2 6 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt;

[[Vicente Escobar]] (1762 - 1834) was a ''[[mestizo]]'' whose skill as a portraitist made him popular among Cuba's elite.&lt;ref&gt;Art Experts; Vicente Escobar y de Flores (1762-1834); http://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/escobarydeflores.php; retvd 1 31 16&lt;/ref&gt;Though having no formal art education himself, he opened what was possibly Cuba's first painting workshop/studio, and later graduated with honors from the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] in Madrid. His portraiture was firmly in the European Classical style, but had a distinctive freshness and energy.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuda Arte: Vicente Escobar; http://www.cernudaarte.com/artists/vicente-escobar/; retvd 1 31 16&lt;/ref&gt;

A slave revolt culminating in neighboring Haiti's declaration of independence in 1804 proved something of a windfall for Cuba, as refugee plantation owners and their slaves relocated to the underdeveloped, underpopulated eastern portion of the island. However, the success of [[Toussaint Louverture|Toussaint]] and [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]]' slave uprising spread intense anxiety throughout the Caribbean, and one response to it was the growth of ''[[costumbrismo]]'' - realist yet romanticized views of day-to-day life - in Cuban art.&lt;ref name = CArt/&gt; 
[[File:Tipos y Costumbres de la Isla de Cuba, Victor Patricio Landaluze, 1881.jpg|thumbnail|right|''Tipos y Costumbres de la Isla de Cuba'', Victor Patricio Landaluze, 1881.]]
A leading early artist in this genre was Spanish-born [[Víctor Patricio de Landaluze]] (1830 - 1889), whose paintings depicted plantation life as rough but essentially natural and harmonious. His political cartoons for the magazine ''El Almendares'' took a more satirical view of the urbanized "Creole aristocracy". Opposed to Cuban independence, Landaluze eventually fell out of favor with the public, but his work remains valued for capturing the atmosphere and attitudes of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Cernuda Arte: Víctor Patricio Landaluze http://www.cernudaarte.com/artists/victor-patricio-landaluze/; retvd 1 31 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt;&lt;ref name = CArt/&gt;

On January 11, 1818, the [[Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes "San Alejandro"|Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes]] (known as the "Academy San Alejandro", in honor of an important founder/benefactor) was established in Havana, under the direction of Frenchman Jean Baptiste Vermay (1786 - 1833). The oldest art academy in Latin America, it is the second oldest institution of higher education in Cuba, after the [[University of Havana]]. Continuing to the present day, it has produced many of Cuba's most important artists.&lt;ref&gt;EcuRed: School of Fine Arts San Alejandro; https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.ecured.cu/Escuela_de_Artes_Pl%25C3%25A1sticas_San_Alejandro&amp;prev=search retvd 2 6 16&lt;/ref&gt;

By the later 19th century landscape painting had become popular, with artists such as [[Miguel Arias Bardou]], [[Guillermo Collazo]], [[José Abreu Morell]], and [[José Joaquín Tejada]] creating scenes featuring Cuba's lush natural environment. Despite the benign content of their work, many artists (perhaps most prominently, Collazo) were strong supporters of Cuban independence, and some were forced into exile.

In 1898 Spain's four centuries of rule over Cuba came to an end when U.S. troops intervened on the side of rebel fighters. Independence, however, proved illusory, with the United States controlling Cuba's foreign policy and much of its economy,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dep't of State-Office of the Historian; The United States, Cuba, and the Platt Amendment, 1901; https://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/platt retvd 2 6 16&lt;/ref&gt; while strong-man presidents did little to foster freedom and democracy. Artists of the early Republican era continued much as before, painting landscapes and scenes of Cuban life in the traditional European style, some of them  showing light touches of [[Impressionism]]. Many, such as [[Antonio Sanchez Araujo]], [[Armando Menocal]], [[Antonio Rodriguez Morey]], Domingo Ramos Enriquez, and [[Leopoldo Romañach]], went on to become instructors or administrators at the Academy San Alejandro and other arts institutions. The Modernist movements which convulsed European art early in the 20th century initially had little impact on the closed, academic world of contemporary Cuban art.&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt;

==Vanguardia artists&lt;!--Linked from 'One Hundred Years of Solitude'--&gt;==
In the late 19th century, landscapes dominated Cuban art and classicism was still the preferred genre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubanculture.com/english/pintura.asp Cuban Culture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614070228/http://www.cubanculture.com/english/pintura.asp |date=June 14, 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The radical artistic movements that transformed European art in the first decades of the century arrived in Latin America in the 1920s to form part of a vigorous current of artistic, cultural, and social innovation.&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt;
[[File:¿Quiere Mas Café Don Nicolas? Antonio Gattorno, ca. 1938.jpg|thumbnail|left|''¿Quiere Mas Café Don Nicolas?'', Antonio Gattorno, ca. 1938.]]
By the late 1920s, the Vanguardia artists had rejected the conventions of Cuba's national art academy, the [[Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes “San Alejandro”]], in [[Havana]], which most of them had attended. In their formative years, many had lived in [[Paris]], where they studied and absorbed the tenets of [[Surrealism]], [[Cubism]], and modernist [[Primitivism]]. Modernism burst on the Cuban scene as part of the critical movement of national regeneration that arose in opposition to the dictatorship of [[Gerardo Machado]], American neo-colonial control, and the consequent economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Ades, Dawn. ''Art in Latin America: The Modern Era, 1820&amp;ndash;1980''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989: 7.&lt;/ref&gt; They returned to Cuba committed to new artistic innovation and keen to embrace the heritage of their island. These artists became increasingly political in their ideology, viewing the rural poor as symbols of national identity in contrast to the ruling elite of post independence Cuba. Vanguard leader [[Eduardo Abela]], a painter who studied in Paris, was typical of the movement. He discovered his homeland Cuba from abroad, apparently motivated by a combination of distance and nostalgia. On his return, Abela entered a highly productive period of work. His murals of Cuban life were complemented by cartoons which became social critiques of Cuban life under the authoritarian Machado regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubanet.org/lee/abela.html Eduardo Abela] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721230457/http://www.cubanet.org/lee/abela.html |date=July 21, 2006 }} Cubanet&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:La Gitana Tropical, 1929, by Víctor Manuel.jpg|thumbnail|right|''La Gitana Tropical'', 1929, by Víctor Manuel.]]
Pioneers of the movement included Abela, [[Antonio Gattorno]], [[Victor Manuel Garcia Valdes|Victor Manuel]], [[Fidelio Ponce de León]], and [[Carlos Enríquez Gómez]]. Born around the turn of the century, these artists grew up amidst the turmoil of constructing a new nation, and reached maturity when Cubans were engaged in discovering and inventing a national identity. They fully shared in the sense of confidence, renovation, and nationalism that characterized Cuban progressive intellectuals in the second quarter of the twentieth century.

Antonio Gattorno (1904 - 1980) and Eduardo Abela (1889 - 1965) were the earliest painters of their generation to adapt modern European and Mexican art to the interpretation of their Cuban subjects. They also found in the directness and idealization of early Renaissance painting an effective model for their expression of Cuban themes. These painters' criollo images, for all their differences, shared a modern primitivist view of Cuba as an exotic, timeless, rural land inhabited by simple and sensual, if also sad and melancholic people. Although rooted in Cuba's natural and cultural environment, the vision of ''lo cubano'' (the Cuban) was far removed from contemporary historical reality. Instead it was based on an ideal conception of patria that had been a component of Cuban nationalism and art since the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt;

This idealized vision featured strongly in the portraits and landscapes of Victor Manuel (1897 - 1969), who was particularly impressed by the works of [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Paul Gauguin]] during his two relatively brief stays in Paris. A San Alejandro graduate highly skilled in drawing and composition, Manuel chose to apply primitivist simplicity to his Cuban subjects - a favorite being the female face - and brought out qualities of melancholy and strength, as captured in ''La Gitana Tropical'' (''The Tropical Gipsy'', 1929), which is considered by critics to be one of the defining pieces of Cuban Avant-garde art.&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernuda Art: Victor Manuel Garcia; http://www.cernudaarte.com/artists/victor-manuel-garcia/ retvd 12 9 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis which Carlos Enríquez (1900 - 1957) and Fidelio Ponce (1895 - 1949) placed on the themes of change, transformation, and death have had an enduring impact on Cuban art.&lt;ref&gt;Cruz-Taura, Graciella; Fuentes-Perez, Ileana; Pau-Llosa, Ricardo. ''Outside Cuba''. New Jersey: Office of Hispanic Arts Mason Gross School of the Arts, 1988: 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Enríquez and Ponce represent two approaches to death: the first marked by exuberant flight and emotion; the second by moody contemplation. If Enríquez painted the delirium after the triumphed siege, Ponce painted the anteroom of grief. Enriquez was a self-taught painter from a wealthy family, while Ponce, though he had attended the San Alejandro Academy, spent his life in poverty. What these two most original and distinctive of the vanguardia painters had in common - aside from severe problems with alcoholism - was the fact that neither had studied in Europe.&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI&gt;Martinez, Juan A.;''Cuban Art &amp; National Identity: The Vanguardia Painters, 1927-1950''; University Press of Florida, 1994; {{ISBN|0-8130-1306-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1927, solo exhibitions were held for Victor Manuel and Antonio Gattorno at Havana's Association of Painters and Sculptors, followed in May by the ''First Exposition of New Art'', a group show featuring mostly Cuban modernists. Trumpeted by the avant-garde journal ''Revista de Avance'', these well-received shows were important strides towards the acceptance of modern art in Cuba.&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt; 

The masters of the first generation of Cuban modernism set the stage for the prevalence of certain themes that would govern Cuban art after 1930, and which would have varying degrees of impact on those generations that would later emerge entirely in exile after 1960. Between 1934 and 1940, and still reeling from the overthrow of Machado, Cuba was searching for its cultural identity in its European and African roots. The landscape, flora, fauna, and lore of the island, as well as its peasants - the often neglected foundation of Cuba's soul and economy - emerged in its art.&lt;ref&gt;Cruz-Taura, Graciella; Fuentes-Perez, Ileana; Pau-Llosa, Ricardo. ''Outside Cuba''. New Jersey: Office of Hispanic Arts Mason Gross School of the Arts, 1988: 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wifredo Lam]] (1902 - 1982), a Cuban of Chinese, Spanish, and African ancestry, had little direct involvement with the Havana vanguardia, but was of the same generation and had similar motivations and experiences with his art. After attending the San Alejandro Academy, he initially took the more traditional route of studying in [[Madrid]], and lived and worked in Spain for many years. After serving in the [[Spanish Civil War]], he fled to Paris, where he came under the wing of [[Pablo Picasso]], who kindled Lam's interest in African sculpture. Lam also befriended the Surrealist poet/philosopher [[André Breton]]. Returning to Cuba in 1941 after two decades abroad, Lam was enchanted, dismayed, and powerfully inspired by his homeland. He rapidly developed his mature style, which incorporated elements of Cubism, Surrealism, and [[African art]], along with imagery of the [[Santeria]] rituals he'd grown up around. In 1943 he painted ''The Jungle'', which is considered to be among the masterpieces of Cuban art.&lt;ref name = WLam&gt;Sims, Lowery Stokes; ''Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923-1982''; University of Texas Press, 2002; {{ISBN|0-292-77750-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = CArt&gt;Poupeye, Veerle; Caribbean Art; Thames and Hudson Ltd., London, 1998; {{ISBN|0-500-20306-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt;

[[Amelia Peláez]] (1896 - 1968) was the sole major female artist of the vanguardia. A San Alejandro graduate, she studied and worked for several years in Paris, where, prior to her return to Havana in 1934, she absorbed the influence of [[Henri Matisse]] and, especially, the Cubism of Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]]. During her long career she worked in a variety of media, including paint, pottery, and mosaic, and explored a variety of subjects and themes, but whether creating her abstracted still life paintings or her famed large scale public murals, her work consistently employed vivid color and elaborate composition, as well as representations of Cuba's tropical flora and Havana's ubiquitous  Spanish Colonial architectural motifs. For all its colorful energy, however, French critic Francis de Miomandre sensed in her work "a closed, completely enigmatic world, haunted by an enigmatic silence." She, Lam, and Enriquez have come to be considered Cuban art's most distinctive and definitive stylists.&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt;&lt;ref name=CUNET&gt;Cubanet-artist biography:Amelia Pelaez; http://www.cubanet.org/htdocs/lee/amelia.html retvd 12 18 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = CArt/&gt;
[[File:Untitled painting, 1947, Amelia Pelaez.jpg|thumbnail|left|Untitled painting, 1947, Amelia Peláez.]]
By 1935 the vanguardia were recognized in Cuba as an important cultural force, and began to gain considerable notice internationally. Major exhibitions of Cuban modern art were held in the United States and throughout Latin America in the late 1930s and 40s. Wrote Albert H. Barr, Jr., organizer of the ''Cuban Modern Painting'' exhibition at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 1944, "We may be grateful for that reckless exuberance, gaiety, candor, and love of life which the Cuban painters show perhaps more than the artists of any other school."&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt; 

Modern Cuban art was at last seen in Paris, France, in an exhibition at the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]] in 1951.&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt; 

The artists themselves saw little material benefit from the growth of interest in modern Cuban art. Occasional purchase awards were doled out, as at the First National Salon of Painting and Sculpture in 1935, but there was no consistent system of patronage, and commissions for Cuba's avant-gardists were rare. Most subsisted on low-paying teaching jobs and commercial work; a few, such as Enriquez and Pelaez, had means of support via their families, and some, such as Ponce and Manuel, lived in poverty.&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt; The only one of them to eventually command high prices for his work while still living was Wifredo Lam.&lt;ref name = WLam/&gt;

Other notable artists of the original vanguardia were Jorge Arche, [[Marcelo Pogolotti]], Aristides Fernandez, Rafael Blanco, Domingo Ravenet, Alberto Peña, and Lorenzo Romero Arciaga. The Second National Salon of Painting and Sculpture in 1938 brought to the fore a second generation of modern artists which included [[Cundo Bermudez]], [[Mario Carreño Morales|Mario Carreño]], [[Rita Longa]], Alfredo Lozano, Luis Martinez-Pedro, and [[René Portocarrero]]&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt;

By the late 1940s the first generation of vanguard artists had dispersed, pursuing their individual careers. Lam went on to great success, living mainly in Paris after 1952.&lt;ref name = WLam/&gt; Arche, Fernandez, and Peña died young;  Enriquez and Ponce both achieved some international recognition before dying in middle-age. Others, such as Gattorno and Pogolotti, left Cuba and took their art in entirely new directions; still more emigrated after the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959, which left Cuban artists isolated from art developments and markets in the United States and Europe. Several, such as Pelaez, Abela, and Manuel, continued to produce work in Cuba.&lt;ref name = CA&amp;NI/&gt;

The vanguardia artists received international recognition in 2003 with the ''Modern Cuban Painting'' exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, subsequently shown in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=MARTIF94 Cuban Art and National Identity: The Vanguardia Painters] Juan A. Martínez&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Cuban artists continue to do significant work in this tradition, including [[Juan Ramón Valdés Gómez]] (called Yiki) and [[Jose Angel Toirac Batista]].

"Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Naïve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive…"'' ''Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The term naïve itself can be problematic; usually meaning an artist is self-taught, it has been used in the past by academic artists or critics as a derogatory term, since naïve artists tend to ignore the basic rules of art. In spite of their disregard for academic conventions, naïve artists are often quite sophisticated in their personal forms of artistic expression.

The colors used in Cuban naïve art are especially vivid, with artists using the vibrant hues of their tropical home to present an idealized view of rural life, with spiritual references to Catholicism and Santeria's ''Orichas'' (deities), legends, and other aspects of Afro-Cuban culture, past and present. This naïve style of art portrays the typical Cuban worldview of the enjoyment of life despite its hardships&lt;ref&gt;''Naïve Art from Cuba''. New York, NY: Center for Cuban Studies. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
    
In the 1950s, American tourism in Cuba created great demand for folkloric and picturesque art, leading to increased production of what came to be known as "tourist art", most of which was classified as naïve.&lt;ref&gt;Mouial, Gérald. "Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Naïve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive…"'' ''Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 9&lt;/ref&gt; At the time this art was seen as a "backward, barbaric, and crude form of expression that must be swept away," rather than an authentic representation of a living culture.&lt;ref&gt;Fure, Rogelio Martinez. "Afrocuba: An Anthology of Cuban Writing on Race, Politics and Culture". Ed. [[Pedro Pérez Sarduy|Sarduy, Pedro Perez]], and Jean Stubbs. Melbourne: Ocean Press. 1993: 104.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, educational, cultural, and artistic activities were encouraged, with artists able to attend the nation's free-access art schools (''Escuelas Nacionales de Arte''—now known as ''Instituto Superior de Arte''). Even so, whether due to physical isolation or disinterest in the world of academic painting, there remained a large number of self-taught ''Ingenuous'' or ''Spontaneous'' painters. Many of these artists joined together to form the ''Movement of Popular Artists'' in the early 1960s. Although this and other co-operative efforts waned over the following decades, the artists themselves continued to paint.&lt;ref&gt;Mouial, Gérald. "Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Naïve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive…"'' ''Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Cuban national pride in academic achievement and artistic training, it had been considered demeaning to be called a naïve artist in the early years after the Revolution. Since naïve artists were not generally recognized by the government as professional artists, they were not taken seriously by the arts community at large, and were at times harassed, their art sales being claimed illegal activity by the Cuban government.&lt;ref&gt;Mouial, Gérald. "Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Naïve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive…".  Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century, however, this attitude began to change.

In 1997, Sandra Levinson, executive director of the Center for Cuban Studies Art Space in New York City, organized ''Naïve Art in Cuba'', a first-of-its-kind exhibition at the Metropolitan Arts Center featuring the art of fourteen Cuban naïve artists, in addition to the eight members of the ''Grupo Bayate'' artist's collective from [[Mella, Cuba|Mella]], [[Santiago de Cuba Province|Santiago de Cuba]]. These artists were discovered during a 1996 trip to Cuba by Levinson, Olga Hirshhorn, and others, who crisscrossed the island searching for examples of this style of art, of which so little had previously been seen in the United States&lt;ref&gt;''Naïve Art from Cuba''. New York, NY: Center for Cuban Studies. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The unofficial head of ''Grupo Bayate'' is Luis Rodríguez Arias (born 1950), a baker by profession. He is known as ''el maestro'' to differentiate him from his son, artist Luis Rodríguez Ricardo (born 1966), who calls himself ''el estudiante''. Both were represented in the ''Naïve Art from Cuba'' exhibition, which ran from September 11 to October 10, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;'' Naïve Art from Cuba''. New York, NY: Center for Cuban Studies. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Luis ''El estudiante'' Rodriguez is among the most prominent Cuban Naïve painters. He began painting at eighteen years of age; he has described his first painting, of a girlfriend's home, as "horrible".&lt;ref&gt;Mouial, Gérald. "Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Naïve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive…"'' ''Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 178.&lt;/ref&gt; After serving in the army and working in construction, he was assigned to farm labor during Cuba's "special period". In those years he began to work with sculpture as a way to supplement his income, turning to painting a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;Mouial, Gérald. "Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Naïve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive". Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Like most naïve artists, he finds inspiration for his work in the experiences of his daily life: religious rituals and the events and people of his community. Having grown up in a neighborhood of mostly Haitian families, he is well aware of their struggles; he sometimes describes his work as "polemic".&lt;ref&gt;Mouial, Gérald. "Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Naïve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive". Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 179.&lt;/ref&gt;In January 1997, ''el estudiante'' held a one-man show in Santiago de Cuba's largest and most prestigious gallery, Oriente, and continues to take part in exhibitions held by ''Grupo Bayate''. In June, 2002 his work was described as "riotously colorful and stacked like a rush-hour train" in a ''New York Times'' article entitled "Ebullient Cubans Make a Lot Out of a Little",&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Annette. "Art/Architecture; Ebullient Cubans make a Lot Out of a Little". ''[[The New York Times]]'' (2000): 35. ''Academic Search Complete'': 2.&lt;/ref&gt; which also speaks of the art-market success of his naïve style.

Another artist featured in the 1997 Metropolitan Arts Center ''Naïve Art from Cuba'' exhibition was Julián Espinoza Rebollido, also known as Wayacón. Born in 1931 (although his birth was not registered until 1941, making him "officially" 10 years younger than he actually is), Wayacón began painting as a child. Attending school only through the 3rd grade, this self-taught artist supported himself as a builder, auditing courses at the Cuban academy when he was older. In the 1950s he joined the Signos artists' group, and participated in his first exhibitions in Japan and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Mouial, Gérald. "Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Naïve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive…". Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Although an admirer of [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[Marc Chagall|Chagall]], [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], his greatest inspirations come from observing the practice of the Santeria religion.&lt;ref&gt;Mouial, Gérald. "Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Naïve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive…". Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his paintings show its influence, containing vivid colors and religious imagery, with an almost hallucinogenic quality.&lt;ref&gt;'' Naïve Art from Cuba''. New York, NY: Center for Cuban Studies. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The foremost naïve artist in Cuba is [[José Rodríguez Fuster]], known as Fuster. In addition to his paintings and drawings, he has over the years transformed the poor suburb of Jaimanitas, Havana, into a magical, dreamlike streetscape, drawing on his expertise as a ceramist to create an environment evocative of [[Antoni Gaudi]]'s famed [[Park Güell]] in [[Barcelona]]. There is a chess park, with giant boards and tables, houses individually decorated with ornate murals and domes, a riot of giant roosters, gauchos, Afro-Cuban religious figures installed by the entrance of many houses, a Fusterised theatre, public squares, and a large mural.

The primitive-outsider art of Corso de Palenzuela (b. Havana, ca.1960), a self-taught painter of Sephardic ancestry, taps a rich lode of memory for its source material, depicted in a very personal Cuban landscape. Although he emigrated to the U.S. with his family at the age of eight, his colorfully vivid work places great emphasis on bringing out the rich cultural heritage of his native land.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, David-"Striving to Capture Cultures and Beauty of Cuba", ''The New York Times'', July 25, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not technically a naive artist, [[Manuel Mendive]] is perhaps the single most important exponent of contemporary Afro-Cubanismo in the visual arts. Born in 1944 into a Santería-practicing family, he graduated from the prestigious Academia de Artes Plásticas San Alejandro in Havana in 1962 with honors in sculpture and painting.

Few naïve artists have been represented in either Contemporary Art Salons or the Biennial of Havana. However, with growing interest in the genre, there are, as of 2015, increasing numbers of academic artists who have begun to paint in this style, with greater representation for all.&lt;ref&gt;Mouial, Gérald. "Magic Art in Cuba: 51 Cuban Painters, Naïve, Ingenuous, Primitive, Popular, Spontaneous, Intuitive…"'' ''Ciudad de la Habana: Artecubano; National Council of the Visual Arts of Cuba. 2004: 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art in Post-Revolutionary Cuba==
In the 1960s the aftermath of the Cuban revolution brought new restrictions, causing an exodus of intellectuals and artists. The new régime required "a practice of culture as ideological propaganda, along with a stereotyped nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;
Mosquera, Geraldo. ''The New Cuban Art: Post Modernism and Postsocialist Condition''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003. 208&amp;ndash;247, Print.
&lt;/ref&gt; Although government policies - driven by limited resources - did narrow artistic expression, they expanded, through education and subsidies, the number of people who could practice art, breaking down barriers through democratization and socialization. The increasing influence of the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1960s and 1970s did impact Cuban culture, but the Cuban government did not match the U.S.S.R in its degree of control over the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;
Mosquera, Geraldo. ''The New Cuban Art: Post Modernism and Postsocialist Condition''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003. 208&amp;ndash;247, Print.
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ché poster, 1968, designed by Alfredo Rostgaard.jpg|left|thumbnail|Ché poster, 1968, designed by Alfredo Rostgaard, based on photograph by Alberto Korda. The poster was distributed in [[OSPAAAL]]'s magazine ''Tricontinental''.]]
In the 1960s government agencies such as the Commission of Revolutionary Orientation (the publishing division of the Cuban Communist Party, later renamed Editora Politica (EP)) and [[Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America|OSPAAAL]] began churning out posters for propaganda purposes. Many of these used stereotypically Soviet design features, but even some early samples showed hints of the Cuban flair for colorful and inventive graphic design, and by the late 60s, Cuban graphic art was in its heyday. Though still essentially producing propaganda, artists such as [[Rene Mederos]], [[Raúl Martínez (artist)|Raul Martinez]], [[Alfredo Rostgaard]], and [[Félix Alberto Beltrán Concepción|Félix Beltran]] were creating vivid, powerful, and highly distinctive works which had global influence on graphic design.&lt;ref&gt;Cushing, Lincoln; ''¡Revolucion!: Cuban Poster Art''. Chronicle Books, 2003; {{ISBN|0811835820}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An image commonly used by Cuban graphic designers was "Guerillero Heroica", a photograph of [[Ché Guevara]] taken by [[Alberto Korda]] (b. Havana, 1928 – d. Paris, 2001). The candid shot of a moody, exhausted Guevara, taken in March, 1960 at a memorial service for victims of an [[La Coubre explosion|ammunition ship explosion]] in [[Havana Harbor]], became one of the world's most iconic images. It was eventually altered and adapted for everything from gum wrappers to a 90 ft. tall commemorative iron sculpture in Havana's [[Plaza de la Revolución]]. Korda was a popular fashion photographer who became a devoted revolutionary and close companion of Fidel Castro, taking thousands of shots of Castro's travels and Cuba's transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Havana Cultura - Visual Arts - Alberto Korda, photographer; http://havana-cultura.com/en/visual-arts/alberto-korda; retvd 3 12 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Art History Archive - photography: Alberto Korda; http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/photography/Alberto-Korda.html; retvd 3 12 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Cubans remained intent on reinforcing a Cuban identity rooted in its own culture, as exemplified by the work of [[Grupo Antillano]].&lt;ref&gt;de la Fuente, Alejandro. ''Grupo Antillano: The Art of Afro-Cuba''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2013.
&lt;/ref&gt; The simultaneous assimilation or synthesis of the tenets of modern western art and the development of Afro-Cuban art schools and movements created a new Cuban culture.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Art proliferated under state programs of sponsorship and employment during this post-revolutionary period; the programs both politicized artistic content and inspired confidence in the people within the framework of Cuba's reinvented nationalism. Nelson Dominguez and Roberto Fabelo went from Abstraction and [[Neoexpressionism]] of the 1950s, to immortalizing the proletariat, farmers, workers and soldiers, while continuing to utilize many of the techniques they learned under the tutelage of Antonia Eiriz Vázquez. By combining nationalism with the politicization of art, artists maintained a level of freedom that continues to inspire innovation.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The [[Salón de Mayo]] (May Salon) was an art exhibition held in Havana in July 1967. Organized by [[Carlos Franqui]], it presented works by more than a hundred artists and represented rival schools of twentieth-century art: early modernists (Picasso, Miro, Magritte); the next generation (Lam, Calder, Jacques Hérold, [[Stanley Hayter]]); and postwar ([[Asger Jorn]], [[Antonio Saura]], Jorge Soto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sims|first1=Lowery Stokes|title=Wifredo Lam and the International Avant-Garde, 1923-1982 |date=2002|publisher=University of Texas Press|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13wev5Hppj0C&amp;pg=PA154&amp; |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represented the high point of artistic free expression in the decade following the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson |first1=Stephen|title=Detective Fiction in Cuban Society and Culture|date=2006|publisher=Peter Lang AG|pages=72ff. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkRJ77zp6ToC&amp;pg=PA72&amp; |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The new art==
The 1960s and 1970s saw the introduction of [[conceptual art]], shifting emphasis away from craftsmanship to ideas. This often meant the elimination of objects in art production; only ideas were stated or discussed. It required an enhanced level of participation by the patron (interactive participation or a set of instructions to follow). Conceptual art, [[Minimalism]], [[Earth art]], and [[Performance art]] mingled together to expand the very definition of Art.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Ann Lee. "Conceptual Art". ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists''. Oxford: 2007. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1970s, many of the graduates of the school of the arts in Cuba, "the Facultad de Artes Plasticas of the Instituto Superior de Arte" (founded in 1976) were going to work as schoolteachers, teaching art to young Cubans across the island. This provided a platform for the graduates to teach students about freedom of expression in medium, message, and style of art.  It was this new level of experimentation and expression that was to enable the movement of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Tonel, Antonio Eligio. "A Tree From Many Shores: Cuban Art in Movement". ''Art Journal''. 57.4 (1998) 62&amp;ndash;74. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cuba, these new developments were naturally synthesized through the Afro-Cuban sensibility and emerged as The New Art, an art movement widely recognized as distinctly Cuban.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Young artists born after the revolution rebelled against modernism and embraced conceptual art, amongst other genres. Many would carry on folkloric traditions and Santeria motifs in their individual expressions while infusing their message with humor and mockery.&lt;ref&gt;Mosquera, Geraldo. ''The New Cuban Art: Post Modernism and Postsocialist Condition''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003. 208&amp;ndash;247, Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The art took a qualitative leap by creating international-art structured on African views, not from the outside like surrealism but from the inside, alive with the cultural-spiritual complexities of their own existence.

The exhibition Volumen Uno, in 1981, wrenched open the doors for The New Art. Participants, many of whom were still in school, created a typical generational backlash by artists of the previous generation including Alberto Jorge Carol, Nelson Dominguez, and César Leal, who went on the attack against the upstarts. The group, Volumen Uno - made up of [[Jose Bedia]], [[Lucy Lippard]], [[Ana Mendieta]], Richardo Brey, Leandro Soto, [[Juan Francisco Elso]], Flavio Garciandia, Gustavo Perez Monzon, Rubin Torres Llorea, Gory (Rogelio Lopez Marin), and [[Tomas Sanchez]] - presented a "fresh eclectic mix filtered through informalism, pop, minimalism, conceptualism, performance, [[graffiti]] and [[Arte Povera]] reconfigured and reactivated … to be critically, ethically, and organically Cuban".&lt;ref name = Utopia&gt;Weiss, Rachel. ''To and from Utopia in the New Cuban Art''. London: [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

This age of artist was dedicated to people who were willing to take risks in their art and truly express themselves, rather than to express only things that supported the political movement.  While looking at art of the 1980s we see a trend in use of the shape of Cuba itself as inspiration for art.  One piece, ''Immediately Geographic'' by artist Florencio Gelabert Soto, is a sculpture in the shape of Cuba, but is broken into many pieces.  One interpretation could reflect the still unequal treatment towards artists, and the repression they were under. A movement that mirrored this artistic piece was underway in which the shape of Cuba became a token in the artwork in a phase known as "tokenization".  This artwork often combined the shape of the island of Cuba with other attributes of the nation, such as the flag.  By combining the various symbols of Cuba together the artists were proudly proclaiming 'this is who we are'.  Some art critics and historians however will argue that this was partially due to the isolated nature of the island, and that use of the island in artwork represented a feeling of being alone; as with all art, the intention of the artist can have many interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, Antonio Eligio. "The Island, the Map, the Travelers: Notes on Recent Developments in Cuban Art". ''Boundary 2''. 29.3 (2002) 77&amp;ndash;90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 1980s another group of artists sought a more explicit political responsibility to "revive the mess", "revive the confusion", as Aldo Menendez incorporated into his 1988 installation. Accompanying Menéndez's installation was a note: "As you can see, this work is almost blank. I could only start it due to the lack of materials. Please help me." Here is the Cuban humor, the ''choteo'', "perhaps the most quintessentially Cuban expression".&lt;ref name = Utopia/&gt;

Laughter became the antidote of an anarchistic energy for and from the revolution; "one moment an aggressive undertow, then a jester's provocation, pressuring the tensions", wrote Rachel Weiss in ''To and from Utopia in the New Cuban Art''.&lt;ref name = Utopia/&gt; "The ''choteo'' is allergic to authority and prestige, the enemy of order in all its manifestations…civil disenchantment, the incredulous and mocking inner nature of the Cuban rises to the surface."&lt;ref name = Utopia/&gt; The ''choteo'', doing away with exactitude, tends to depict the extreme limits of an example. This sardonic Cuban humor has become as ubiquitous in Cuban art as the bright Caribbean colors of its palette. [[Eduardo Ponjuan]], [[Glexis Novoa]] (of the [[ABTV group]]), [[Carlos Rodriguez Cardenas]], [[Carlos Garaicoa]] and [[Rene Francisco]] are exemplars of this sensibility, mixing it with kitsch and harkening back in time while identifying with current Cuban attitudes, liberating art on the eve of the Cuban '[[special period]]', in which the Soviet Union withdrew its financial aid.

In 1990 the Cuban government began programs to stimulate the tourist trade as a means of offsetting the loss of Soviet support. In 1992 the constitution was amended{{by whom|date=September 2014}} to allow and protect foreign-owned property, and in 1993 the dollar was permitted to circulate legally. In 1994 a cabinet-level department was created, the Ministry of Tourism, to further enhance tourism, which is Cuba's largest source of income.&lt;ref name = Utopia/&gt; The initial reaction of the artists, as well as the general population, was withdrawal; "Withdrawal from the public to the private…from the collective to the individual…from the epic to the mundane…from satire to metaphor...Withdrawal from controversy…withdrawal from confrontation".&lt;ref name = Utopia/&gt; But it was the withdrawal from conceptual to figurative art that defined the change in painting. Due in large measure to the interest of tourists, art took on higher visibility, as well as returning to a more figurative mode of expression. Art also worked as a space where Cubans debated some of the social problems magnified by the "[[Special Period]]", as illustrated by the [[Queloides]] art project, which deals with issues of race and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;de la Fuente, Alejandro.  ''Queloides: Race and Racism in Cuban Contemporary Art''. Pittsburgh: Mattress Factory, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Every Cuban is an artist and every home is an art gallery," wrote Rachel Weiss in ''To and from Utopia in the New Cuban Art''.&lt;ref name = Utopia/&gt;

==Political influences in Cuban art==
"A question of major importance in Cuban culture is the link between radical political and artistic positions…where culture carries a marked social edge attuned to the circumstances in which it is produced and where it is forced to construct a national identity in the face of colonial and neo colonial powers."&lt;ref&gt;Mosquera, Geraldo. ''The New Cuban Art: Post Modernism and Postsocialist Condition''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003. 208&amp;ndash;247, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, when the New Cuban Art Movement was consolidating, many still hoped to establish the [[Third World]] utopia of social justice promised by the Cuban revolution. While Cuba shares many characteristics with other Latin American countries three factors guarantee it a unique placement amongst the formerly colonized countries of the Americas:

* Spain continued emigration to Cuba in large numbers until the middle of the 20th century
* The native population was eliminated in the 17th century
* Cuba possesses the most varied cultural traditions of all the African diaspora in America

"Although freedom of expression is nonexistent in Cuba, a certain amount of dissonance can be tolerated for recognized artists, at the right time and the right place, which basically means occasionally, in officially sanctioned (and controlled) venues, with very little (if any) spillover in the media. This keeps everybody on his or her toes, and creates a tension that is useful for the state. The global market seems to like its Cuban art with a dash of political irreverence, though many great works of Cuban artists sold abroad feature no obvious Cuban, Caribbean or Latin American style or content. Cuban artists are often masters of double entendre and detachment (parody, irony, sarcasm, and pastiche). The regime can afford to appear moderately open-minded since this kind of art is mostly inconsequential on the island. It can be censored when it appears to be crossing the line, perhaps leaving the artist free to present it abroad and to exhibit some other works at home."&lt;ref&gt;Yvon Grenier, Culture and the Cuban State; Participation, Recognition,
 and Dissonance under Communism (Lexington Books, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Religious influences in Cuban art==
In addition to the Christian, predominately Catholic, there are four African Religions continuing to influence culture being practiced in Cuba: [[Santeria]] (Yoruba), [[Palo Monte]] (Kongo), [[Regla Arara]] (Ewe Fon), and the secret, male only, [[Abakua]] (Calabar). The African religions operate independently and synthesized with each other and the Christian religions ([[syncretism]]). These unique views of reality form a core of practices, beliefs, and customs that has shaped a cultural distinction labeled Afro-Cuban and known as the dominate force in Cuban art; a transracial, "hybridized, inventive, and influential in the construction of contemporary [Cuban] culture".&lt;ref&gt;Mosquera, Geraldo. ''The New Cuban Art: Post Modernism and Postsocialist Condition''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003. 208&amp;ndash;247.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DeepDream''' is a [[computer vision]] program created by [[Google]] engineer Alexander Mordvintsev which uses a [[convolutional neural network]] to find and enhance patterns in [[image]]s via [[algorithm]]ic [[pareidolia]], thus creating a [[dream]]-like [[hallucinogenic]] appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.&lt;ref name=codexample/&gt;&lt;ref name=goingdeeper/&gt;&lt;ref name=arxiv/&gt;

Google's program popularized the term (deep) "dreaming" to refer to the generation of images that produce desired [[activation (neural network)|activation]]s in a trained [[deep neural network|deep network]], and the term now refers to a collection of related approaches.

==History==
The DeepDream software originated in a deep [[convolutional neural network|convolutional network]] codenamed "Inception" after the [[Inception|film of the same name]],&lt;ref name=codexample&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708233542/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|archivedate=2015-07-08|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|title=DeepDream - a code example for visualizing Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goingdeeper&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703064823/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|archivedate=2015-07-03|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|title=Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christian |last1=Szegedy  |first2=Wei |last2=Liu |first3=Yangqing |last3=Jia|first4=Pierre |last4=Sermanet|first5=Scott |last5=Reed|first6=Dragomir |last6=Anguelov|first7=Dumitru |last7=Erhan|first8=Vincent |last8=Vanhoucke|first9=Andrew |last9=Rabinovich|title = Going Deeper with Convolutions|journal= Computing Research Repository|year=2014 |arxiv= 1409.4842|bibcode=2014arXiv1409.4842S}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed for the [[ImageNet#ImageNet_Challenge|ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge]] (ILSVRC) in 2014&lt;ref name=arxiv/&gt; and released in July 2015.

The dreaming idea and name became popular on the internet in 2015 thanks to Google's DeepDream program.  The idea dates from early in the history of neural networks,&lt;ref name=lewis88&gt;{{cite conference |last=Lewis |first=J.P. |title=Creation by refinement: a creativity paradigm for gradient descent learning networks |conference=IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks|year=1988|doi=10.1109/ICNN.1988.23933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar methods have been used to synthesize visual textures.&lt;ref name=portilla00&gt;{{cite journal |last=Portilla |first=J |last2=Simoncelli |first2=Eero |title=A parametric texture model based on joint statistics of complex wavelet coefficients |journal=International Journal of Computer Vision |year=2000|doi=10.1023/A:1026553619983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Related visualization ideas were developed (prior to Google's work) by several research groups.&lt;ref name=erhan09&gt;{{cite conference |last=Erhan |first=Dumitru. |title=Visualizing Higher-Layer Features of a Deep Network |conference=International Conference on Machine Learning Workshop on Learning Feature Hierarchies|year=2009|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aaron_Courville/publication/265022827_Visualizing_Higher-Layer_Features_of_a_Deep_Network/links/53ff82b00cf24c81027da530.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=simonyan14&gt;{{cite conference |last=Simonyan |first=Karen |last2=Vedaldi |first2=Andrea |last3=Zisserman |first3=Andrew |title=Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps |conference=International Conference on Learning Representations Workshop |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Google published their techniques and made their code [[open source]],&lt;ref name=github&gt;{{GitHub|google/deepdream}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of tools in the form of web services, mobile applications, and desktop software appeared on the market to enable users to transform their own photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-07/03/google-deep-dream |title= These Google "Deep Dream" Images Are Weirdly Mesmerising |work= Wired |author= Daniel Culpan |date= 2015-07-03 |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==

}}
The software is designed to [[face detection|detect faces]] and other patterns in images, with the aim of automatically classifying images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/7/8904641/fear-and-loathing-clip-google-deep-dream-visualization |title= Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is terrifying through the eyes of a computer |date= 7 July 2015 |accessdate= 2015-07-25 |author= Rich McCormick |work= The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once trained, the network can also be run in reverse, being asked to adjust the original image slightly so that a given output neuron (e.g. the one for faces or certain animals) yields a higher confidence score. This can be used for visualizations to understand the emergent structure of the neural network better, and is the basis for the DeepDream concept. However, after enough reiterations, even imagery initially devoid of the sought features will be adjusted enough that a form of [[pareidolia]] results, by which [[Psychedelic art|psychedelic]] and [[Surrealism|surreal]] images are generated algorithmically. The optimization resembles [[Backpropagation]], however instead of adjusting the network weights, the weights are held fixed and the input is adjusted.

For example, an existing image can be altered so that it is "more cat-like", and the resulting enhanced image can be again input to the procedure.&lt;ref name=goingdeeper&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703064823/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|archivedate=2015-07-03|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|title=Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage resembles the activity of looking for animals or other patterns in clouds.

Applying gradient descent independently to each pixel of the input produces images in which
adjacent pixels have little relation and thus the image has too much high frequency information.
The generated images can be greatly improved by including a prior or [[regularization (mathematics)|regularizer]] that prefers inputs
that have natural image statistics (without a preference for any particular image), or are simply smooth.&lt;ref name="simonyan14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mahendran&gt;{{cite conference |last=Mahendran |first=Aravindh |last2=Vedaldi |first2=Andrea |title=Understanding Deep Image Representations by Inverting Them |conference=IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition |year=2015 |doi=10.1109/CVPR.2015.7299155 |arxiv=1412.0035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yosinski15&gt;{{cite conference |last=Yosinski |first=Jason |last2=Clune |first2=Jeff |last3=Nguyen |first3=Anh |last4=Fuchs |first4=Thomas |title=Understanding Neural Networks Through Deep Visualization |conference=Deep Learning Workshop, International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) Deep Learning Workshop |year=2015 |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06579}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, Mahendran et al.&lt;ref name=mahendran/&gt; used the total variation regularizer that prefers images that are piecewise constant. Various regularizers are discussed further in.&lt;ref name=yosinski15/&gt; An in-depth, visual exploration of feature visualization and regularization techniques was published more recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olah|first=Chris|last2=Mordvintsev|first2=Alexander|last3=Schubert|first3=Ludwig|date=2017-11-07|title=Feature Visualization|url=https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/|journal=Distill|language=en-US|volume=2|issue=11|doi=10.23915/distill.00007|issn=2476-0757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cited resemblance of the imagery to [[LSD]]- and [[psilocybin]]-induced hallucinations is suggestive of a functional resemblance between artificial neural networks and particular layers of the visual cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaFrance|first1=Adrienne|title=When Robots Hallucinate|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/robots-hallucinate-dream/403498/|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[File:Deep Dreamscope (19822170718).jpg|thumb|left|A late-stage ''DeepDream'' processed photograph of three men in a pool]]
The dreaming idea can be applied to hidden (internal) neurons other than those in the output, 
which allows exploration of the roles and representations of various parts of the network.&lt;ref name=yosinski15/&gt;
It is also possible to optimize the input to satisfy either a single neuron (this usage is sometimes called Activity Maximization)&lt;ref name=nguyen16&gt;{{cite conference |last=Nguyen |first=Anh |last2=Dosovitskiy |first2=Alexey |last3=Yosinski |first3=Jason |last4=Brox |first4=Thomas |title=Synthesizing the preferred inputs for neurons in neural networks via deep generator networks |conference=arxiv |arxiv=1605.09304 |year=2016 |bibcode=2016arXiv160509304N }}&lt;/ref&gt; or an entire layer of neurons.

While dreaming is most often used for visualizing networks or producing computer art, it has recently been proposed that adding "dreamed" inputs to the training set can improve training times for abstractions in Computer Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Arora |first=Sanjeev |last2=Liang |first2=Yingyu |last3=Tengyu |first3=Ma |title=Why are deep nets reversible: A simple theory, with implications for training |conference=arxiv |arxiv=1511.05653 |year=2016 |bibcode=2015arXiv151105653A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DeepDream model has also been demonstrated to have application in the field of [[art history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spratt|first=Emily L.|date=2017|title=Dream Formulations and Deep Neural Networks: Humanistic Themes in the Iconology of the Machine-Learned Image|url=https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/bitstream/handle/18452/19403/Spratt%20-%20final.pdf|journal=Kunsttexte|publisher=Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|volume=4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeepDream was used for [[Foster the People]]'s music video for the song "Doing It for the Money".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=fosterthepeopleVEVO|title=Foster The People - Doing It for the Money|date=2017-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ1VorN9Cl0|accessdate=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto''''' written by [[Benedetto Cotrugli]] around 1400 was the first [[bookkeeping]] [[manuscript]] and trade manual.&lt;ref name="item 1441"&gt;[[#Anzovin|Anzovin, 2000]], p. 36, item 1441&lt;/ref&gt; The title has been translated in English by the alternate names of ''Of commerce and the perfect merchant'',&lt;ref name="item 1441"/&gt; ''On merchantry and the perfect merchant'',&lt;ref name="Zubrinic"&gt;[http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/et22a1.html History of Croatian Science, 15th-19th centuries]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''On trade and the perfect dealer.''&lt;ref name="Financial Essay"&gt;[http://www.oxbridgewriters.com/essays/accounting/financial-accounting-accountants.php Essay title - Financial Accounting And Accountants]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Several historians show that, since the manuscript was written in 1458, it is the oldest known manuscript on the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]], and, as such, predates [[Luca Pacioli]]'s book by at least 36 years.&lt;ref name="Zubrinic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Financial Essay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AccountingHistory"&gt;[http://www.promonegocios.net/contabilidad/historia-contabilidad.html Accounting History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/siesc2.html SIESC 2007 in CROATIA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapter XIII"&gt;''In Chapter XIII of the 1st book is called "order to keep " the records marketable '. There are only very vague rules, and the author observes: "..... narrating everything here wanting to '1 minute 'treatment would be too verbose et almost impossible to express it, "that without the living voice, writing can hardly be impa" rare. " However, one can easily argue that Benedict Cotrugli want to talk about the double entry. He says that the scriptures remind you credit, debt, cost of goods, profits and losses and any other cenda ago, adds that the merchant must hold the memorial, the newspaper, and the notebook with its own alphabet, which devesi entered in the log, what to do, the Whole capital and bring everything to your file. 'S work of the merchant Ragusin was not amended in the audience, Luca Pacioli is no longer the first exhibitor of record keeping.'' [[#Alfieri|Alfieri, 1891]], p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely thought that the reason why Luca Pacioli (1445–1517) received credit as the father of accounting is because Cotrugli's work was not officially published until 1573.&lt;ref&gt;[http://html.rincondelvago.com/evolucion-historica-de-la-contabilidad.html Historical evolution of accounting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://paciolicode.com/ 3.

An early copy of ''Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto'' from the end of the fifteenth century is at the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=28931&amp;lang=en | journal = [[Dubrovnik Annals]] | issn = 1331-3878 | publisher = [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] | location = Dubrovnik, Croatia | number = 6 |date=July 2002 | title = Book Review: Marin Rafaeli of Ragusa on Double-Entry Bookkeeping in 1475: a Recent Discovery by Anne J. van der Helm and Johanna Postma | author = Vladimir Stipetić | page = 123 | accessdate = 2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.kpn.nl/annejvanderhelm/paper.html LA RIEGOLA DE LIBRO Bookkeeping instructions from the mid-fifteenth century]&lt;/ref&gt; Another early copy is at [[Biblioteca Marciana]] in Venice.&lt;ref name="AccountingHistory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edit16.iccu.sbn.it/scripts/iccu_ext.dll?fn=10&amp;i=13663 Prospectus Title]&lt;/ref&gt;
The first English translation of the Libro de l'arte de la mercatura (The Book of the Art of Trade) edited by Carlo Carraro and Giovanni Favero, with a foreword by Niall Ferguson, Professor of History at Harvard University, has been published by Palgrave Mcmillan in 2017, based on the critical edition of the original manuscripts made by Vera Ribaudo, University of Venice, published on May 2016 by Edizioni Cà Foscari, Venice. 

== Manuscript content ==
The manuscript contains four books. The first is of the origin, form, and essence of being a [[merchant]]. The second talks of a merchant's religious commitment. The third is of moral virtues and policies. The fourth is administration of his home and family, and his economic matters.&lt;ref name="Chapter XIII"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hangers|Hangers, 1803]], p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the manuscript merchandising was regarded as an art. The "Perfect Merchant" or "Perfect Dealer" was a man of culture motivated  
to good moral conduct and honest transactions to everyone he encountered. He had to be very sensitive to local interests in places where he conducted business. He had to know how to assess the political situation and the customary laws in order to successfully conduct his business. Kotruljević wrote in his bookkeeping and merchandising trade manual that not only must a merchant be a [[bookkeeper]]-[[accountant]], but that he must also be a good writer, a [[rhetorician]] and a [[Intellectual#Men of letters|man of letters]] being diplomatic all the while.&lt;ref name="conduct"&gt;[http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/30/id/123/ Markets of the Mediterranean]&lt;/ref&gt;

He contrasted the "Perfect Merchant" to sailors and soldiers by saying that they were many times naive of these points. He said they were of such dull mind that when they would drink in a tavern and buy bread at a market they often had [[grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]] and were not very diplomatic.&lt;ref name="conduct"/&gt;

A '''Gesamtkunstwerk''' ({{IPA-de|gəˈzamtˌkʊnstvɛʁk|lang}}, translated as "total work of  art",&lt;ref&gt;Millington ([[Wikt:n.d.|n.d.]]), Warrack (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; "ideal work of art",&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''Gesamtkunstwerk''&lt;/ref&gt; "universal artwork",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/U.html#anchor1538384 ArtLex Art Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814172155/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/U.html |date=2016-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "synthesis of the arts", "comprehensive artwork", "all-embracing art form" or "total artwork") is a work of art that makes use of all or many [[The arts|art forms]] or strives to do so. The term is a [[German language|German]] word which has come to be accepted in [[English language|English]] as a term in [[aesthetics]].

The term was first used by the German writer and [[philosopher]] [[Karl Friedrich Eusebius Trahndorff|K. F. E. Trahndorff]] in an essay in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Trahndorff (1827), ''Ästhetik oder Lehre von Weltanschauung und Kunst''&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[opera]] composer [[Richard Wagner]] used the term in two 1849 essays, and the word has become particularly associated with his aesthetic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interlude.hk/front/richard-wagners-concept-of-the-gesamtkunstwerk/|title=Richard Wagner's Concept of the ‘Gesamtkunstwerk’|website=Interlude.hk|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether Wagner knew of Trahndorff's essay.

In the twentieth century, some writers applied the term to some forms of architecture, while others have applied it to film and mass media.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;For discussions of architecture as Gesamtkunstwerk, see the relevant section of this article. For discussions of film and mass media, see for instance Matthew Wilson Smith, ''The Total Work of Art: From Bayreuth to Cyberspace.'' New York: Routledge, 2007; Carolyn Birdsall, ''Nazi Soundscapes: Sound, Technology, and Urban Space in Germany, 1933–1945.''

Gilman, 1–26. Indiana: Indiana University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before Wagner==
Some elements of opera reform, seeking a more "classical" formula, had begun at the end of the 18th century. After the lengthy domination of [[opera seria]], and the ''[[da capo aria]]'', a movement began to advance the [[Libretto|librettist]] and the composer in relation to the singers, and to return the drama to a more intense and less moralistic focus. This movement, "reform opera" is primarily associated with [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] and [[Ranieri de' Calzabigi]]. The themes in the operas produced by Gluck's collaborations with Calzabigi continue throughout the operas of [[Carl Maria von Weber]], until Wagner, rejecting both the Italian ''[[bel canto]]'' tradition and the [[French opera|French]] "spectacle opera", developed his union of music, drama, theatrical effects, and occasionally dance.

However these trends had developed fortuitously, rather than in response to a specific philosophy of art; Wagner, who recognised the reforms of Gluck and admired the works of Weber, wished to consolidate his view, originally, as part of his radical social and political views of the late 1840s. Previous to Wagner, others who had expressed ideas about union of the arts, which was a familiar topic among German [[Romanticism|Romantics]], as evidenced by the title of Trahndorff's essay, in which the word first occurred, "Aesthetics, or Theory of Philosophy of Art". Others who wrote on syntheses of the arts included [[Gottfried Lessing]], [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Novalis]].&lt;ref&gt;Millington (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s enthusiastic review of [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]]'s opera ''[[Undine (Hoffmann)|Undine]]'' (1816) admired it  as 'an art work complete in itself, in which partial contributions of the related and collaborating arts blend together, disappear, and, in disappearing, somehow form a new world'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strunk|first=Oliver|title=Source Readings in Music History: The Romantic Era|year=1965|place=New York|pages=63|url=http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/aurifex/issue1/castein.html|accessdate=2008-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050502044016/http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/aurifex/issue1/castein.html|archivedate=2005-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wagner's ideas==
Wagner used the exact term 'Gesamtkunstwerk' (which he spelt 'Gesammtkunstwerk') on only two occasions, in his 1849 essays "[[Art and Revolution]]" and "[[The Artwork of the Future]]",&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1993), p. 35, where the word is translated as 'great united work'; p. 52 where it is translated as 'great unitarian Art-work'; and p. 88 (twice) where it is translated as 'great united Art-work'.&lt;/ref&gt; where he speaks of his ideal of unifying all works of art via the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Warrack (n.d.), ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' is incorrect in saying that Wagner used the word only in "The Artwork of the Future"&lt;/ref&gt; He also used in these essays many similar expressions such as 'the consummate artwork of the future' and 'the integrated drama', and frequently referred to 'Gesamtkunst'.&lt;ref&gt;Millington (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt; Such a work of art was to be the clearest and most profound expression of folk legend, though abstracted from its nationalist particulars to a universal humanist fable.

Wagner felt that the Greek tragedies of [[Aeschylus]] had been the finest (though still flawed) examples so far of total artistic synthesis, but that this synthesis had subsequently been corrupted by [[Euripides]]. Wagner felt that during the rest of human history up to the present day (i.e. 1850) the arts had drifted further and further apart, resulting in such "monstrosities" as [[Grand Opera]]. Wagner felt that such works celebrated bravura singing, sensational stage effects, and meaningless plots. In "Art and Revolution" Wagner applies the term 'Gesamtkunstwerk' in the context of Greek tragedy. In "The Art-Work of the Future" he uses it to apply to his own, as yet unrealised, ideal.

In his extensive book ''[[Opera and Drama]]'' (completed in 1851) he takes these ideas further, describing in detail his idea of the union of opera and drama (later called ''music drama'' despite Wagner's disapproval of the term), in which the individual arts are subordinated to a common purpose.

Wagner's own opera cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', and specifically its components ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' and ''[[Die Walküre]]'' represent perhaps the closest he, or anyone else, came to realising these ideals;&lt;ref&gt;Grey (2008) 86&lt;/ref&gt; he was himself after this stage to relax his own [[wikt:stricture|strictures]] and write more 'operatically'.&lt;ref&gt;Millington (1992) 294–95&lt;/ref&gt;

==In architecture==
Some architectural writers have used the term ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' to signify circumstances where an architect is responsible for the design and/or overseeing of the building's totality: shell, accessories, furnishings, and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Vidalis, "Gesamtkunstwerk – 'total work of art'", ''Architectural Review'', June 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to make a claim for when the notion of the ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' was first employed from the point of view of a building and its contents (although the term itself was not used in this context until the late 20th century); already during the Renaissance, artists such as [[Michelangelo]] saw no strict division in their tasks between architecture, interior design, sculpture, painting and even engineering. 
It has been argued by historian  Robert L. Delevoy that Art Nouveau represented an essentially decorative trend that thus lent itself to the idea of the architectural ''Gesamtkunstwerk''. But it is equally possible it was born from social theories that arose out of a fear of the rise of industrialism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Delevoy, 'Art Nouveau', in ''Encyclopaedia of Modern Architecture''. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:RobieHouseWindows ChicagoIL.jpg|thumb| [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]: Interior of the Robie House, Chicago, 1909.]]

However evidence of complete interiors that typify the concept of ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' can be seen some time before the 1890s. There was an increasing trend amongst architects in the 18th and 19th centuries to control every facet of an architectural commission. As well as being responsible for the structure they tried to extend their role to include designing (or at least vetting) every aspect of the interior work as well. This included not only the interior architectural features but was extended to the design&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gwerk.westbankcorp.com/|title=Home - GESAMTKUNSTWERK|website=GESAMTKUNSTWERK|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; of furniture, carpets, wallpaper, fabrics, light fixtures and door-handles. [[Robert Adam]] and [[Augustus Welby Pugin]] are examples of this trend to create an over-all harmonising effect which in some cases might even extend to the choice or design of table silver, china and glassware.
 
A distinctly modern approach to the concept of architectural ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' emerged with the [[Bauhaus]] school, first established in [[Weimar]] in 1919 by [[Walter Gropius]]. The school specialised in design, art and craftsmanship (architecture was not introduced as a separate course until 1927 after it had transferred to [[Dessau]]). Gropius contended that artists and architects should also be craftsmen, that they should have experience working with different materials and artistic mediums, including industrial design, clothes design and theatre and music. However, Gropius did not necessarily see a building and every aspect of its design as being the work of a single hand.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Wittick, ''Encyclopaedia of Modern Architecture''. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giulio Paolini''' (born 5 November 1940) is an [[Italy|Italian]] artist associated with both [[Arte Povera]] and [[Conceptual Art]].&lt;ref name=Nota1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/biografia.php |title= Biography |publisher= Artist's official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Paolini was born in [[Genoa]]. After a childhood spent in [[Bergamo]], he moved with his family to [[Turin]] where he still lives today. He attended the Giambattista Bodoni State Industrial Technical School of Graphics and Photography, graduating in the Graphics department in 1959. He had been interested in [[visual arts|art]] from an early age, visiting museums and galleries and reading art periodicals. Towards the end of the 1950s he approached [[painting]], trying some pictures of an abstract nature, close to [[monochrome]]. The discovery of [[Graphic design|modern graphics]] during his studies and the fact that there were architecture magazines around the house – his elder brother Cesare (1937–1983) was an architect – contributed to orienting him towards a line of research aimed at zeroing the image.

He did his first work in 1960, ''Disegno geometrico'' (''Geometrical Drawing''), which consists of the squaring in ink of a canvas painted with white tempera. This preliminary gesture of any representation whatever would remain the point of “eternal recurrence” in the universe of Paolini’s thought: topical moment and original instant that revealed the artist to himself, representing the conceptual foundation of all his future work.

In the early 1960s, Paolini developed his research by focusing on the very components of the picture: on the painter’s tools and on the space of representation. For his first solo show – in 1964 at Gian Tommaso Liverani’s La Salita gallery in [[Rome]] – he presented some rough wooden panels leant against or hanging on the wall, suggesting an exhibition in the process of being set up. The show was seen by Carla Lonzi and Marisa Volpi who would shortly afterwards write the first critical texts on the young artist. In 1965 Paolini began to use photography, which allowed him to extend his inquiry to the relationship between artist and work (''Delfo'', 1965; ''1421965'', 1965). In the same year, through Carla Lonzi, he met [[Luciano Pistoi]], owner of the Galleria Notizie in Turin, who introduced him to a new circle of friends and collectors and became his main dealer until the beginning of the 1970s.

Between 1967 and 1972, the critic [[Germano Celant]] invited him to take part in [[Arte Povera]] exhibitions which resulted in his name being associated with that movement. In fact Paolini’s position was clearly distinct from the vitalistic climate and “existential phenomenology” that distinguished the propositions of Celant’s artists. He repeatedly declared an intimate belonging to the history of art, identifying programmatically with the lineage of all the artists who had preceded him. Some of his best known works can be traced back to this purpose, extraneous to the militant scene of the late 1960s: ''Giovane che guarda Lorenzo Lotto'' (''Young Man Looking at Lorenzo Lotto'', 1967), the “self-portraits” from Poussin and Rousseau (1968) and the pictures in which he reproduces details of old masters’ paintings (''L’ultimo quadro di Diego Velázquez'', 1968; ''Lo studio'', 1968). Among Paolini’s main references in those years were [[Jorge Luis Borges]], to whom he paid homage on several occasions, and [[Giorgio de Chirico]] from whom he borrowed the constituent phrase of the work ''Et.quid.amabo.nisi.quod.ænigma est'' (1969).

His first official acknowledgements came with the 1970s: from shows abroad, which placed him on the international avant-garde gallery circuit, to his first museum exhibitions. In 1970 he took part in the [[Venice Biennale]] with ''Elegia'' (''Elegy'', 1969), the first work in which he used the [[plaster cast]] of a [[classical antiquity|classic]] subject: the eye of Michelangelo’s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' with a fragment of mirror applied to the pupil. One of the outstanding themes in this decade was a backward glance at his own work: from literal citation of celebrated paintings he arrived at self-citation, proposing a historicizing in perspective of his oeuvre. Works such as ''La visione è simmetrica?'' (''Is Vision Symmetrical?'', 1972) or ''Teoria delle apparenze'' (''Theory of Appearances'', 1972) allude to the idea of the picture as potential container of all past and future works. Another theme investigated with particular interest in this period was that of the double and the copy, which found expression above all in the group of works entitled ''Mimesi'' (''Mimesis'', 1975–76) consisting of two plaster casts of the same classical statue set face to face, calling into question the concept of [[mimesis|reproduction]] and representation itself.

The period most dense in exhibitions and retrospectives, with the publication of important monographs, was the 1980s. In the first half of the decade an explicitly theatrical dimension began to establish itself with works marked by fragmentation and dispersion (''La caduta di Icaro'', 1982; ''Melanconia ermetica'', 1983) or distinguished by theatrical figures such as eighteenth century valets de chambre (''Trionfo della rappresentazione'', 1984). Paolini’s poetics was considerably enriched by literary attributions and [[Mythology|mythological]] references, as well as by the introduction of cosmic images. In the late 1980s the artist's reflections turned mainly on the very act of exhibiting. Starting with his solo show at the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes|Musée des Beaux-Arts]] in Nantes (1987) the concept of the exhibition – its premises and its promises – became progressively configured as the actual subject of the works themselves.

In the course of the 1990s, further inquiry into the idea of exhibiting spread into other, new modalities. The increasingly complex set-ups often followed a typology that was additive (seriality, juxtaposition) or centrifugal (dispersion or dissemination from a central nucleus) or centripetal (concentration and implosive superimposition). The place of the exhibition became the stage par excellence of the “theatre of the opus”, meaning of the work in its doing and undoing: the place that defined the very eventuality of its happening (''Esposizione universale'', 1992; ''Teatro dell’opera'', 1993; ''Essere o non essere'', 1995). Completion of the work was moreover constantly deferred, leaving the spectator in perennial expectation: just what the artist always feels from the start at his worktable, waiting for the work to manifest itself.

In the 2000s, another theme especially dear to Paolini took on special importance, as much in his artwork as in his writings: the identity of the author, his condition as spectator, his lack of contact with a work that always precedes and supersedes him.

Paolini’s poetics and artistic practice as a whole may be characterised as a self-reflective meditation on the dimension of art, on its timeless “classicality” and its perspective without vanishing point. By means of [[photography]], [[collage]], [[plaster cast]]s and [[drawing]] his intention is always to inquire, with great conceptual rigour, into the tautological and at the same time metaphysical nature of artistic practice.&lt;ref name=Nota1/&gt;

Since his first solo show ([[Rome]], 1964) Paolini has exhibited in art galleries and museums worldwide. Collaboration with avant-garde Italian galleries of the 1960s and 1970s (La Salita, [[Rome]]; Galleria Notizie, [[Turin]]; Galleria dell'Ariete, [[Milan]]; Galleria del Leone, [[Venice]]; La Tartaruga, [[Rome]]; L'Attico, Rome; Studio Marconi, [[Milan]]; Modern Art Agency, [[Naples]]) was swiftly integrated with regular presence in important foreign galleries (from 1971 Paul Maenz, [[Cologne]]; from 1972 [[Ileana Sonnabend|Sonnabend]], [[New York City]]; from 1973 Annemarie Verna, [[Zurich]]; from 1976 [[Yvon Lambert Gallery|Yvon Lambert]], [[Paris]]; from 1977 [[Lisson Gallery]], [[London]]). Since the 1980s Paolini has mainly been represented by the galleries Christian Stein, [[Milan]]; Massimo Minini, [[Brescia]]; Alfonso Artiaco, [[Naples]]; [[Yvon Lambert Gallery|Yvon Lambert]], [[Paris]] and Marian Goodman, [[New York City]].

The great anthological exhibitions took off towards the late 1970s (Istituto di Storia dell'Arte dell'Università di Parma, [[Parma]], 1976; Städtisches Museum, [[Mönchengladbach]], 1977; Mannheimer Kunstverein, [[Mannheim]], 1977; Museo Diego Aragona Pignatelli Cortes, [[Naples]], 1978; [[Stedelijk Museum]], [[Amsterdam]], touring to The Museum of Modern Art, [[Oxford]], 1980) and culminated in the second half of the 1980s (Le Nouveau Musée, [[Villeurbanne]], 1984, touring to [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]] and [[Charleroi]]; [[Neue Staatsgalerie|Staatsgalerie]], Stuttgart, 1986; [[Castle of Rivoli|Castello di Rivoli]], [[Rivoli (TO)|Rivoli]], 1986; [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna]], [[Rome]], 1988; Galleria Comunale d'Arte Moderna, Villa delle Rose, [[Bologna]], 1990). Outstanding recent solo shows were held in [[Graz]] (Neue Galerie im Landesmuseum Joanneum, 1998), [[Turin]] (Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, 1999), [[Verona]] (Galleria d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea Palazzo Forti, 2001), [[Milan]] (Fondazione Prada, 2003), [[Winterthur]] ([[Kunstmuseum Winterthur]], 2005) and [[Münster]] (Westfälisches Landesmuseum für Kunst und Kulturgeschichte, 2005). For the season 2002/2003 in the [[Vienna State Opera]] Giulio Paolini designed a large scale picture (176 sqm) as part of the exhibition series "Safety Curtain", conceived by [[museum in progress]].&lt;ref name="Safety Curtain by Giulio Paolini"&gt;[http://www.mip.at/creations/eiserner-vorhang-2002-2003 "Safety Curtain 2002/2003"], [[museum in progress]], Vienna.&lt;/ref&gt;

Group exhibitions, innumerable since his participation in the 1961 ''Premio Lissone'', include the shows connected with [[Arte Povera]] (1967–1971, 1984–85, 1997, 2001–02), the main international exhibitions of Italian art and many of the most significant shows dedicated to artistic development in the second half of the 20th century (for example: ''Vitalità del negativo'', [[Rome]] 1970; ''Contemporanea'', Rome 1973; ''Projekt '74'', [[Cologne]] 1974; ''Europe in the Seventies'', [[Chicago]] and touring through the [[United States]] 1977–78; ''Westkunst'', [[Cologne]] 1981; ''‘60–'80': Attitudes/concepts/images'', [[Amsterdam]] 1982; ''An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture'', [[New York City]] 1984; ''The European Iceberg'', [[Toronto]] 1985; ''Transformations in Sculpture'', [[New York City]] 1985; ''Bilderstreit'', [[Cologne]] 1989; ''1965–1975: Reconsidering the Object of Art'', [[Los Angeles]] 1995; ''The Last Picture Show: Artists Using Photography, 1960–82'', [[Minneapolis]] and touring 2003–05). Paolini has appeared several times at [[documenta]] Kassel (1972, 1977, 1982, 1992) and the [[Venice Biennale]] (1970, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1984, 1986, 1993, 1995, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/esposizioni_personali.php |title= Exhibitions |publisher= Artist’s official website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Whitechapel Gallery in London staged Giulio Paolini: To Be or Not To Be, an exhibition of Paolini's sculptures, exhibitions and installations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/giulio-paolini-to-be-or-not-to-be/&lt;/ref&gt; "Giorgio De Chirico-Giulio Paolini Giuilo Paolini Giorgio De Chirico" Center for Italian Modern Art, Oct. 13, 2016-June 24, 2017, New York, NY, italianmodernart.org

==Set design==

In the course of his career Paolini has also worked in the [[scenic design|theatre]], from the sets and costumes for [[Vittorio Alfieri]]’s ''Bruto II'', directed by Gualtiero Rizzi (1969), to his collaboration with Carlo Quartucci and the Zattera di Babele in the 1980s. Outstanding recent projects include the sets for [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]’s [[Die Walküre]] (2005) and [[Parsifal]] (2007) at the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] in Naples, directed by Federico Tiezzi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/scenografie.php |title= Set Design |publisher= Artist’s official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bibliography==

Right from the start Paolini’s productions have been accompanied by written reflections and comments, seen as elements complementary to and parallel with the image. His first collection of texts, ''Idem'', was published by [[Giulio Einaudi|Einaudi]] in 1975 with an essay by [[Italo Calvino]]. Recent collections include ''Quattro passi. Nel museo senza muse'' (Einaudi, Turin 2006) and ''Dall'Atlante al Vuoto (in ordine alfabetico)'' published by Mondadori Electa, Milan 2010. In 1995 Maddalena Disch edited a complete edition of his writings and interviews (''Giulio Paolini: la voce del pittore. Scritti e interviste 1965–1995'', ADV Publishing House, [[Lugano]]).

The first monograph on the artist, by [[Germano Celant]], was published in 1972 in [[New York City]] by [[Ileana Sonnabend|Sonnabend Press]]. The most significant books on Giulio Paolini, including critical anthologies and a wealth of documentation, are the catalogues brought out on the occasion of his solo shows in [[Parma]] (1976), [[Ravenna]] (1985, ''Giulio Paolini. Tutto qui'', Edizioni Essegi, Ravenna), [[Stuttgart]] (1986), [[Rome]] (1988), [[Graz]] (1998) and [[Milan]] (2003). In 1990 Francesco Poli edited a monograph for Edizioni Lindau of Turin. In 1992 Marco Noire published ''Impressions graphiques. L’opera grafica 1967–1992 di Giulio Paolini'', a general catalogue of his prints and multiples. In 2008 the publisher Skira of Milan brought out a two volume Catalogue Raisonné of Paolini's works from 1960 to 1999, edited by Maddalena Disch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/bibliografia.php |title= Bibliography |publisher= Artist’s official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan, prayer hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Hypostyle prayer hall of the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], in Tunisia.]]

In [[architecture]], a '''hypostyle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|p|ə|ˌ|s|t|aɪ|l|,_|ˈ|h|ɪ|p|ə|-}}) [[hall]] has a roof which is supported by columns.

==Etymology==
The word ''hypostyle'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ὑπόστυλος ''hypóstȳlos'' meaning "under columns" (where ὑπό ''hypó'' means below or underneath and στῦλος ''stŷlos'' means column).&lt;ref name=""&gt;"Hypostyle", Random House Dictionary (unabridged) 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical options==
The roof may be constructed of with bridging [[lintels]] of stone, wood or other rigid material such as cast iron, steel or reinforced concrete. There may be a ceiling. The columns may be all the same height or, as in the case of the [[Great Hypostyle Hall]] at [[Karnak]], the columns flanking the central space may be of greater height rather than those of the side aisles, allowing openings in the wall above the smaller columns, through which light is admitted over the aisle roof, through [[clerestory]] windows. 

===Applications===
The architectural form has many applications, occurring in the [[cella]] of [[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] temples and in many Asian buildings, particularly of wood construction.

===Mosques===
With a combination of columns and [[arch]]es, the hypostyle hall became one of the two main types of [[mosque]] construction. In many mosques, especially the early congregational mosques, the prayer hall has the hypostyle form.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.tn/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=hypostyle+early+congregational+mosques&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=A3ZeTdnSHIGDOtr6-PUN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=hypostyle%20early%20congregational%20mosques&amp;f=false Fred S. Kleiner, ''Gardner's art through the ages : the western perspective'', Cengage Learning, 2010, p. 265]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the finest examples of the hypostyle-plan mosques is the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] (also called the Mosque of Uqba) in the city of [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.tn/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=Gardner%27s+art+mosque+of+kairouan&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=2XleTezUM8fpOd2jjMAN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fred S.

After this building succumbed to fire in the taking of the Haram, Ibn Zubayr ... placed three teak-wood columns in a single row. (p 20) The mosque at Kufa became so paradigmatic that later hypostyle mosques are generally known as Kufa- or Kufic-type mosques.

[[File:Ed and pope.png|thumb|right|alt=A painting|288px|In this [[Elizabethan]] work of propaganda, the top right of the picture depicts men busy pulling down and smashing icons, while power is being handed from the dying King Henry VIII to his far more staunchly Protestant son Edward VI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aston|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Loach|1999|p=187}}; {{Harvnb|Hearn|1995|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]
'''Iconoclasm'''&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Literally, "image-breaking", from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:εἰκών|εἰκών]] and [[wikt:κλάω|κλάω]]}}. ''Iconoclasm'' may be also considered as a [[back-formation]] from iconoclast (from Greek εἰκοκλάστης). The corresponding Greek word for iconoclasm is εἰκονοκλασία – ''eikonoklasia''.&lt;/ref&gt; is the social belief in the importance of the destruction of [[icon]]s and other images or monuments, most frequently for religious or political reasons. People who engage in or support iconoclasm are called ''iconoclasts'', a term that has come to be applied figuratively to any individual who challenges "cherished beliefs or venerated institutions on the grounds that they are erroneous or pernicious".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Iconoclast, 2", see also "Iconoclasm" and "Iconoclastic".&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conversely, one who reveres or venerates religious images is called (by iconoclasts) an ''iconolater''; in a [[Byzantine]] context, such a person is called an ''[[iconodule]]'' or ''iconophile''.

The term does not generally encompass the specific destruction of images of a ruler after his death or overthrow (''[[damnatio memoriae]]'').

Iconoclasm may be carried out by people of a different religion, but is often the result of sectarian disputes between factions of the same religion. Within Christianity, iconoclasm has generally been motivated by those who adopt a literal interpretation of the [[Ten Commandments]], which forbid the making and worshipping of "graven images or any likeness of anything".&lt;ref&gt;"You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them&amp;nbsp;..." (Exodus 20:4–5a, ESV.)&lt;/ref&gt; The later [[Church Fathers]] identified [[Jews]], fundamental iconoclasts, with [[heresy]] and saw deviations from orthodox Christianity and opposition to the veneration of images as heresies that were essentially "Jewish in spirit".&lt;ref name=RobertM1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michael|first1=Robert|title=A history of Catholic antisemitism : the dark side of the church|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-11131-8|pages=28–30|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan pbk.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZnFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=anti-semitism+jews+jewish+heretics+heresy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Wc7_FQaTAj&amp;sig=CzUEubnkVNbs8SedIKEa3US63yg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l7_YVMjmKYX5yQO_m4LIBw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=heretic&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of iconoclasm among Christian branches greatly varies. [[Islam]], in general, tends to be more iconoclastic than Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hs.ias.edu/files/Crone_Articles/Crone_Islam_Judeo-Christianity_and_Byzantine_Iconoclasm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Sunni Islam]] being more iconoclastic than [[Shia Islam]].

==Religious iconoclasm==

===Ancient era===
{{Main|Akhenaten}}
[[File:Amun.JPG|thumb|[[Amun]]]]

In the [[Bronze Age]], the most significant episode of iconoclasm occurred in Egypt during the [[Amarna Period]], when [[Akhenaten]], based in his new capital of [[Akhetaten]], instituted a significant shift in Egyptian artistic styles alongside a campaign of intolerance towards the traditional gods and a new emphasis on a state [[monolatry|monolatristic]] tradition [[Atenism|focused on the god]] [[Aten]], the Sun disk— many temples and monuments were destroyed as a result:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In rebellion against [[Egyptian polytheism|the old religion]] and [[High Priest of Amun|the powerful priests]] of [[Amun]], Akhenaten ordered the eradication of all of Egypt's traditional gods. He sent royal officials to chisel out and destroy every reference to Amun and the names of other deities on tombs, temple walls, and cartouches to instill in the people that the [[Aten]] was the one true god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Akhenaten.aspx |title=Akhenaten |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public references to Akhenaten were destroyed soon after his death.

Comparing the [[ancient Egypt]]ians with the [[Israelites]], Jan Assmann writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For Egypt, the greatest horror was the destruction or abduction of the cult images.  In the eyes of the [[Israelites]], the erection of images meant the destruction of [[divine presence]]; in the eyes of the Egyptians, this same effect was attained by the destruction of images.  In Egypt, iconoclasm was the most terrible religious crime; in Israel, the most terrible religious crime was [[idolatry]].  In this respect Osarseph alias Akhenaten, the iconoclast, and the [[Golden Calf]], the paragon of idolatry, correspond to each other inversely, and it is strange that [[Aaron]] could so easily avoid the role of the religious criminal.  It is more than probable that these traditions evolved under mutual influence.  In this respect, [[Moses]] and Akhenaten became, after all, closely related.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Assmann, ''From Akhenaten to Moses: Ancient Egypt and Religious Change'', pg. 76, 2014, [[The American University in Cairo Press]], {{ISBN|977-416-631-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Byzantine era===
{{Main|Byzantine Iconoclasm}}
[[File:Clasm Chludov detail 9th century.jpg|thumb|[[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], [[Chludov Psalter]], 9th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/1320Hist&amp;Civ/slides/14islam/iconoclasm.JPG |title=Byzantine iconoclasm |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although [[Christian art|widespread use of Christian iconography]] only began as Christianity increasingly spread among gentiles after the legalization of Christianity by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] (c. 312 AD), scattered expressions of opposition to the use of images were reported (e.g. Spanish [[Synod of Elvira]]). The period after the reign of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian]] (527–565) evidently saw a huge increase in the use of images, both in volume and quality, and a gathering aniconic reaction.

In the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]], government-led iconoclasm began with [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo&amp;nbsp;III]], following what seems to have been a long period of rising [[Aniconism in Christianity|opposition to the use or misuse of images]].  The religious conflict created political and economic divisions in Byzantine society.  It was generally supported by the Eastern, poorer, non-Greek peoples of the Empire&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Mango, ''The Oxford History of Byzantium,'' 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; who had to deal frequently with raids from the new Muslim Empire.  On the other hand, the wealthier Greeks of [[Constantinople]], and also the peoples of the Balkan and Italian provinces, strongly opposed iconoclasm.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Byzantine Empire the government had probably been adopting Christian images more frequently. One notable change came in 695, when [[Justinian II]]'s government added a full-face image of Christ on the [[obverse]] of imperial gold coins. The change caused the [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] to stop his earlier adoption of Byzantine coin types. He started a purely Islamic coinage with lettering only.&lt;ref name="RC"&gt;Robin Cormack, ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', 1985, George Philip, London, {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A letter by the Patriarch Germanus written before 726 to two Iconoclast bishops says that "now whole towns and multitudes of people are in considerable agitation over this matter" but there is little written evidence of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;C Mango, "Historical Introduction", in Bryer &amp; Herrin, eds., ''Iconoclasm'', pp. 2–3., 1977, Centre for Byzantine Studies, [[University of Birmingham]], {{ISBN|0-7044-0226-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The first iconoclastic period: 730–787===
Sometime between 726 and 730, the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] began the iconoclast campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. (ed.) F. GIOIA, ''The Popes – Twenty Centuries of History'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana (2005), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  He ordered the removal of an image of [[Jesus]] prominently placed over the [[Chalke]] gate, the ceremonial entrance to the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]], and its replacement with a cross.  Some of those assigned to the task were killed by a band of [[iconodules]].&lt;ref name="theoph1"&gt;see Theophanes, ''Chronographia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years conflict developed between those who wanted to use the images, claiming that they were "icons" to be "venerated", and the iconoclasts who claimed they were simply idols. [[Pope Gregory&amp;nbsp;III]] "convoked a synod in 730 and formally condemned iconoclasm as heretical and excommunicated its promoters.  The papal letter never reached Constantinople as the messengers were intercepted and arrested in Sicily by the Byzantines".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. (ed.) F. GIOIA, ''The Popes – Twenty Centuries of History'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana (2005), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine&amp;nbsp;V]] convened the [[Council of Hieria]] in 754.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinstitute.org/index.php/chm/eighth-century/icons/ |title=Issue 54: Eastern Orthodoxy &amp;#124; Christian History Magazine |publisher=Chinstitute.org |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 338 bishops assembled concluded, "the unlawful art of painting living creatures blasphemed the fundamental doctrine of our salvation—namely, the Incarnation of Christ, and contradicted the six holy synods&amp;nbsp;...

===Second Council of Nicaea 787===
[[File:Seventh ecumenical council (Icon).jpg|thumb|An [[icon]] of the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] (17th century, [[Novodevichy Convent]], Moscow).]]
{{Main|Second Council of Nicaea}}
In 780, Constantine&amp;nbsp;VI ascended the throne in Constantinople, but being a minor, was managed by his mother Empress [[Irene of Athens|Irene]].  She decided that an ecumenical council needed to be held to address the issue of iconoclasm and directed this request to [[Pope Adrian I]] (772–795) in Rome.  He announced his agreement and called the convention on 1 August 786 in the presence of the Emperor and Empress.  The initial proceedings were interrupted by the violent entry of iconoclast soldiers faithful to the memory of the prior Emperor Constantine&amp;nbsp;V.  This caused the council to be adjourned until a reliable army could be assembled to protect any proceedings. The council was reassembled at [[Nicaea]] 24 September 787.  During those proceedings the following was adopted:

{{quote|... we declare that we defend free from any innovations all the written and unwritten ecclesiastical traditions that have been entrusted to us. One of these is the production of representational art; this is quite in harmony with the history of the spread of the gospel, as it provides confirmation that the becoming man of the Word of God was real and not just imaginary, and as it brings us a similar benefit.  For, things that mutually illustrate one another undoubtedly possess one another's message.

 ... we decree with full precision and care that, like the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, the revered and holy images, whether painted or made of mosaic or of other suitable material, are to be exposed in the holy churches of God, on sacred instruments and vestments, on walls and panels, in houses and by public ways; these are the images of our Lord, God and saviour, Jesus Christ, and of our Lady without blemish, the holy God-bearer, and of the revered angels and of any of the saintly holy men.  The more frequently they are seen in representational art, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these images the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred cult objects.&lt;ref name="Tanner, Norman P. p. 132–136"&gt;Tanner, Norman P., Alberigo, G., Dossetti, J.

===Views in Byzantine iconoclasm===
Accounts of iconoclast arguments are largely found in iconodule writings.  To understand iconoclastic arguments, one must note the main points:
# Iconoclasm condemned the making of any lifeless image (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;painting or statue) that was intended to represent Jesus or one of the saints. The "Epitome of the Definition of the Iconoclastic Conciliabulum" ([[Synod of Hiereia]]) held in 754 declared:&lt;ref name="hieria1"/&gt; 

{{quote|Supported by [[the Holy Scriptures]] and the Fathers, we declare unanimously, in the name of the Holy Trinity, that there shall be rejected and removed and cursed one of the [[Christian Church]] every likeness which is made out of any material and colour whatever by the evil art of painters&amp;nbsp;... If anyone ventures to represent the divine image (χαρακτήρ, ''charaktēr'') of the Word after the Incarnation with material colours, let him be anathema!&amp;nbsp;... If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself, let him be anathema!}}

#  For iconoclasts, the only real religious image must be an exact likeness of the prototype—of the same substance—which they considered impossible, seeing wood and paint as empty of spirit and life.  Thus for iconoclasts the only true (and permitted) "icon" of Jesus was the [[Eucharist]], which was believed to be his body and blood.
#  Any true image of Jesus must be able to represent both his divine nature (which is impossible because it cannot be seen nor encompassed) as well his human nature.  But by making an icon of Jesus, one is separating his human and divine natures, since only the human can be depicted (separating the natures was considered [[nestorianism]]), or else confusing the human and divine natures, considering them one (union of the human and divine natures was considered [[monophysitism]]).
#  Icon use for religious purposes was viewed as an innovation in the Church, a Satanic misleading of Christians to return to pagan practice. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Satan misled men, so that they worshipped the creature instead of the Creator. The Law of Moses and the Prophets cooperated to remove this ruin.&amp;nbsp;... But the previously mentioned demiurge of evil&amp;nbsp;... gradually brought back idolatry under the appearance of Christianity.&lt;ref name="hieria1"&gt;{{citation |title=Epitome of the Iconoclast Council at Hieria, 754 AD |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/icono-cncl754.html |publisher=[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook.html Internet Medieval Sourcebook] |postscript=,}} also available from [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xvi.x.html Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was also seen as a departure from ancient church tradition, of which there was a written record opposing religious images.
[[File:Triumph of Orthodoxy.jpg|thumb|288px|Triumph of Orthodoxy]]
The chief theological opponents of iconoclasm were the monks Mansur ([[John of Damascus]]), who, living in Muslim territory as advisor to the Caliph of Damascus, was far enough away from the Byzantine emperor to evade retribution, and [[Theodore the Studite]], abbot of the [[Stoudios]] monastery in Constantinople.  John declared that he did not venerate matter, "but rather the creator of matter".  However he also declared, "But I also venerate the matter through which salvation came to me, as if filled with divine energy and grace". He includes in this latter category the ink in which the gospels were written as well as the paint of images, the wood of the Cross, and the Body and Blood of Jesus.

The iconodule response to iconoclasm included:
#  Assertion that the biblical commandment forbidding images of God had been superseded by the incarnation of Jesus, who, being the Second Person of the Trinity, is God incarnate in visible matter. Therefore, they were not depicting the invisible God, but God as He appeared in the flesh. This became an attempt to shift the issue of the incarnation in their favor, whereas the iconoclasts had used the issue of the incarnation against them.
#  Further, in their view idols depicted persons without substance or reality while icons depicted real persons. Essentially the argument was "all religious images not of our faith are idols; all images of our faith are icons to be venerated". This was considered comparable to [[Old Testament|the Old Testament]] practice of offering burnt sacrifices only to God, and not to any other gods.
#  Moses had been instructed by God according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:18–22|NKJV}} to make golden statues of [[cherubim]] angels on the lid of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:31|NKJV}} God instructed Moses to embroider the curtain which separated the [[Holy of Holies]] in the [[Tabernacle]] with cherubim. Moses had also been told by God to embroider the tent walls of the Tabernacle with cherubim angels according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:1|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|36:8|NKJV}}.
#  Regarding the written tradition opposing the making and veneration of images, they asserted that icons were part of unrecorded oral tradition (''parádosis'', sanctioned in Christianity as authoritative in doctrine by reference to {{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:15|NKJV}}, [[Basil the Great]], etc.).
#  Arguments were drawn from the miraculous [[Acheiropoieta]], the supposed icon of the Virgin painted with her approval by St.&amp;nbsp;Luke, and other miraculous occurrences around icons, that demonstrated divine approval of Iconodule practices.
#  Iconodules further argued that decisions such as whether icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council, not imposed on the church by an emperor. Thus the argument also involved the issue of the proper relationship between church and state. Related to this was the observation that it was foolish to deny to God the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor.

The first iconoclastic wave happened in [[Wittenberg]] in the early 1520s under reformers [[Thomas Müntzer]] and [[Andreas Karlstadt]]. It prompted [[Martin Luther]], then concealing as ''Junker Jörg'', to intervene.

In contrast to the [[Lutheran]]s who favoured sacred art in their churches and homes,&lt;ref name="Lamport2017"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamport|first=Mark A.|title=Encyclopedia of Martin Luther and the Reformation|date=31 August 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781442271593|page=138|quote=Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somewhat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Felix2015"/&gt; the [[Reformed]] (Calvinist) leaders, in particular [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]], encouraged the removal of religious images by invoking the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue's]] prohibition of idolatry and the manufacture of graven (sculpted) images of God.&lt;ref name="Felix2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Felix|first=Steven|title=Pentecostal Aesthetics: Theological Reflections in a Pentecostal Philosophy of Art and Aesthetics.|date=30 January 2015|publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]]|language=English|isbn=9789004291621|page=22|quote=Luther's view was that biblical images could be used as teaching aids,and thus had didactic value. Hence Luther stood against the destruction of images wheras several other reformers (Karlstadt, Zwingli, Calvin) promoted these actions. In the following passage, Luther harshly rebukes Karlstadt on his stance on iconoclasm and his disorderly conduct in reform.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, individuals attacked statues and images. However, in most cases, civil authorities removed images in an orderly manner in the newly Reformed Protestant cities and territories of Europe. 

Significant iconoclastic riots took place in [[Basel]] (in 1529), [[Zurich]] (1523), [[Copenhagen]] (1530), [[Münster]] (1534), [[Geneva]] (1535), [[Augsburg]] (1537), [[Scotland]] (1559), [[Rouen]] (1560) and [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]] and [[La Rochelle]] (1562).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekSkZXXjVWUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA148 |title=Neil Kamil, ''Fortress of the soul: violence, metaphysics, and material life'', p. 148 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voracious Idols and Violent Hands|last=Wandel|first=Lee Palmer|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|year=1995|isbn=0-521-47222-9|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvinist iconoclasm in Europe "provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs" in Germany and "antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox" in the Baltic region.&lt;ref name="Marshall2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=The Reformation|date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780191578885|page=114|quote=Iconoclastic incidents during the Calvinist 'Second Reformation' in Germany provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs, while Protestant image-breaking in the Baltic region deeply antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox, a group with whom reformers might have hoped to make common cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seventeen Provinces]] (now the Netherlands, Belgium and parts of Northern France) were disrupted by widespread Calvinist iconoclasm in the summer of 1566.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise History of Western Art|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|language=English |isbn=9781424069224|page=254|quote=In an episode known as the Great Iconoclasm, bands of Calvinists visited Catholic churches in the Netherlands in 1566, shattering stained-glass windows, smashing statues, and destroying paintings and other artworks they perceived as idolatrous.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the ''[[Beeldenstorm]]'' and began with the destruction of the statuary of the Monastery of [[Saint Lawrence]] in [[Steenvoorde]] after a ''"Hagenpreek"'', or field sermon, by Sebastiaan Matte. Hundreds of other attacks included the sacking of the Monastery of [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]] after a sermon by Jacob de Buysere. The ''Beeldenstorm'' marked the start of the [[Eighty Years' War|revolution]] against the Spanish forces and [[Roman Catholic Church|the Catholic Church]].

The iconoclastic belief caused havoc throughout [[Europe]]. In 1523, specifically due to the Swiss reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]], a vast number of his followers viewed themselves as being involved in a spiritual community that in matters of faith should obey neither the visible Church nor lay authorities. According to Peter George Wallace:

{{quote|"Zwingli's attack on images, at the first debate, triggered iconoclastic incidents in [[Zurich]] and the villages under civic jurisdiction that the reformer was unwilling to condone."  And due to this action of protest against authority, "Zwingli responded with a carefully reasoned treatise that men could not live in society without laws and constraint."&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Peter George. ''The Long European Reformation: Religion, Political Conflict, and the Search for Conformity, 1350–1750''. Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004. p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the [[Reformation in England]] started during the reign of Anglican monarch [[Henry VIII]], and urged on by reformers such as [[Hugh Latimer]] and [[Thomas Cranmer]], limited official action was taken against religious images in churches in the late 1530s. Henry's young son, [[Edward VI]], came to the throne in 1547 and, under Cranmer's guidance, issued Injunctions for Religious Reforms in the same year and in 1550, an [[Act of Parliament]] "for the abolition and putting away of divers books and images".&lt;ref&gt;Heal, Felicity (2005), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mtGoSCVhRFIC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;lpg=PA264&amp;dq=1550+statute+for+abolishing+images&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=19oOGbcpPr&amp;sig=r7TeKMsCL2HThPLGZaWl1p-pUIU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2wq0VIHpG5PA7Abw9IDIDw&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1550%20statute%20for%20abolishing%20images&amp;f=false ''Reformation in Britain and Ireland''], Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-928015-5}} (pp. 263–4)&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[English Civil War]], Bishop [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] of [[Norwich]] described the events of 1643 when troops and citizens, encouraged by a Parliamentary ordinance against superstition and [[idolatry]], behaved thus:

What wresting out of irons and brass from the windows! What defacing of arms! What demolishing of curious stonework! What tooting and piping upon organ pipes! And what a hideous triumph in the market-place before all the country, when all the mangled organ pipes, vestments, both copes and surplices, together with the leaden cross which had newly been sawn down from the Green-yard pulpit and the service-books and singing books that could be carried to the fire in the public market-place were heaped together.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For I am convinced that it is God's will that we should hear and learn what He has done, especially what Christ suffered. But when I hear these things and meditate upon them, I find it impossible not to picture them in my heart. Whether I want to or not, when I hear, of Christ, a human form hanging upon a cross rises up in my heart: just as I see my natural face reflected when I look into water.

Within [[Muslim history]], the act of removing idols from the [[Ka'ba]] in Mecca is considered by all believers to be of great symbolic and historical importance.

In general, Muslim societies have [[Aniconism in Islam|avoided the depiction]] of living beings (animals and humans) within such sacred spaces as [[mosque]]s and [[madrasah]]s. This opposition to figural representation is based not on the [[Qur'an]], but on traditions contained within the [[Hadith]]. The prohibition of figuration has not always extended to the secular sphere, and a robust tradition of figural representation exists within [[Islamic art|Muslim art]].&lt;ref name="flood2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flood |first=Finbarr Barry |title=Between cult and culture: Bamiyan, Islamic iconoclasm, and the museum |journal=The Art Bulletin |volume=84 |year=2002 |pages=641–659 |doi=10.2307/3177288}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Western authors have tended to perceive "a long, culturally determined, and unchanging tradition of violent iconoclastic acts" within [[Islamic culture|Islamic society]].&lt;ref name="flood2002"/&gt;

===Early Islam in Arabia===
The first act of Muslim iconoclasm dates to the beginning of Islam, in 630, when the various statues of [[Arabian mythology|Arabian deities]] housed in the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] were destroyed. There is a tradition that Muhammad spared a fresco of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Life of Muhammad.  A translation of Ishaq's "Sirat Rasul Allah".|publisher=Oxford University Press | last=Guillaume | first=Alfred | authorlink=Alfred Guillaume | year=1955 | page=552 | isbn=978-0-19-636033-1 | quote=Quraysh had put pictures in the Ka'ba including two of Jesus son of Mary and Mary (on both of whom be peace!).&amp;nbsp;... The apostle ordered that the pictures should be erased except those of Jesus and Mary. | url=https://archive.org/details/IbnIshaq-SiratRasulAllah-translatorA.Guillaume | accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act was intended to bring an end to the [[idolatry]] which, in the Muslim view, characterized [[Jahiliyya]].

The destruction of the idols of Mecca did not, however, determine the treatment of other religious communities living under Muslim rule after the expansion of the [[caliphate]]. Most Christians under Muslim rule, for example, continued to produce icons and to decorate their churches as they wished. A major exception to this pattern of tolerance in early Islamic history was the "Edict of Yazīd", issued by the [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Yazid&amp;nbsp;II]] in 722–723.&lt;ref&gt;A. Grabar, ''L'iconoclasme byzantin: le dossier archéologique'' (Paris, 1984), 155–56.&lt;/ref&gt;
This edict ordered the destruction of crosses and Christian images within the territory of the caliphate. Researchers have discovered evidence that the order was followed, particularly in present-day [[Jordan]], where [[archaeological]] evidence shows the removal of images from the mosaic floors of some, although not all, of the churches that stood at this time. But, Yazīd's iconoclastic policies were not continued by his successors, and Christian communities of the Levant continued to make icons without significant interruption from the sixth century to the ninth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = G.

===Egypt===
[[File:Sphinx of Giza 9059.jpg|thumb|The Sphinx profile in 2010, sans nose]]The [[Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr|missing nose]] on the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] is attributed to iconoclasm by a Sufi Muslim fanatic in the mid-1300s.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;[[al-Maqrīzī]], writing in the 15th century, attributes the damage to [[Muhammad Sa'im al-Dahr]], a Sufi Muslim fanatic from the khanqah of Sa'id al-Su'ada, in 1378.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic conquests===
Certain conquering Muslim armies have used local temples or houses of worship as mosques. An example is [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]] (formerly [[Constantinople]]), which was converted into a mosque in 1453. Most icons were desecrated and the rest were covered with plaster. In the 1920s, Hagia Sophia was converted to a museum, and the restoration of the mosaics was undertaken by the American Byzantine Institute beginning in 1932.

More dramatic cases of iconoclasm by Muslims are found in parts of India where [[Hindu]] and Buddhist temples were razed and mosques erected in their place. Aurangzeb destroyed the famous Hindu temples at [[Varanasi]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pauwels|first=Heidi|last2=Bachrach|first2=Emilia|date=2018|title=Aurangzeb as Iconoclast?

====Recent events====

Certain Muslim denominations continue to pursue iconoclastic agendas.  There has been much controversy within Islam over the [[Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia|recent and apparently on-going destruction of historic sites]] by [[Saudi Arabian]] authorities, prompted by the fear they could become the subject of "[[idolatry]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Howden |first=Daniel |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article304029.ece |title=Independent Newspaper on-line, London, Jan 19, 2007 |publisher=News.independent.co.uk |date=2005-08-06 |accessdate=2013-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908083433/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article304029.ece |archive-date=September 8, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicamagazine.com/content/view/161/59/ ''Islamica'' Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723162212/http://www.islamicamagazine.com/content/view/161/59/ |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent act of iconoclasm was the 2001 destruction of the giant [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] by the then [[Taliban]] government of [[Afghanistan]]. The act generated world-wide protests and was not supported by other Muslim governments and organizations. It was widely perceived in the Western media as a result of the Muslim prohibition against figural decoration. Such an account overlooks "the coexistence between the Buddhas and the Muslim population that marveled at them for over a millennium" before their destruction.&lt;ref name="flood2002"/&gt; The Buddhas had twice in the past been attacked by [[Nadir Shah]] and [[Aurengzeb]]. According to the art historian F.B. Flood, analysis of the Taliban's statements regarding the Buddhas suggest that their destruction was motivated more by political than by theological concerns.&lt;ref name="flood2002"/&gt; Taliban spokespeople have given many different [[Buddhas of Bamyan#Destruction|explanations of the motives]] for the destruction.

==Political and revolutionary iconoclasm==
[[File:Johannes Adam Simon Oertel Pulling Down the Statue of King George III, N.Y.C. ca. 1859.jpg|thumb|The [[Sons of Liberty]] pulling down the statue of [[George&amp;nbsp;III of the United Kingdom]] on [[Bowling Green (New York City)]], 1776]]

===''Damnatio memoriae''===
{{main|damnatio memoriae}}
Revolutions and changes of regime, whether through uprising of the local population, foreign invasion, or a combination of both, are often accompanied by the public destruction of statues and monuments identified with the previous regime. This may also be known as ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'', the ancient Roman practice of official obliteration of the memory of a specific individual. Stricter definitions of "iconoclasm" exclude both types of action, reserving the term for religious or more widely cultural destruction. In many cases, such as [[Revolutionary Russia]] or [[Ancient Egypt]], this distinction can be hard to make.

Among Roman emperors and other political figures subject to decrees of ''damnatio memoriae'' were [[Sejanus]], [[Publius Septimius Geta]], and [[Domitian]]. Several Emperors, such as [[Domitian]] and [[Commodus]] had during their reigns erected numerous statues of themselves, which were pulled down and destroyed when they were overthrown.

===Iconoclasm in the French Revolution===
&lt;!-- this should be broken out into a separate article --&gt;
Throughout the radical phase of the [[French Revolution]], iconoclasm was supported by members of the government as well as the citizenry.  Numerous monuments, religious works, and other historically significant pieces were destroyed in an attempt to eradicate any memory of the [[Old Regime]].  At the same time, the republican government felt responsible to preserve these works for their historical, aesthetic, and cultural value.  One way the republican government succeeded in their paradoxical mission of preserving and destroying symbols of the Old Regime was through the development of museums.

During the Revolution, a statue of [[King Louis XV]] in the Paris square which until then bore his name, was pulled down and destroyed. This was a prelude to the [[guillotine|guillotining]] of his successor [[Louis XVI]] in the same site, renamed "Place de la Révolution" (at present [[Place de la Concorde]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Idzerda|first=Stanley J.|year=1954|title="Iconoclasm during the French Revolution"|url=|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=60/1|pages=13–26|via=|doi=10.2307/1842743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] on the column at [[Place Vendôme]], Paris was also the target of iconoclasm several times: destroyed after the [[Bourbon Restoration]], restored by [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], destroyed during the [[Paris Commune]] and restored by [[Adolphe Thiers]].
&lt;!-- 
===Roland and the Monuments Commission===
The Monuments Commission had a responsibility of preserving art despite its problematic political symbolism. Jean Roland was installed as the Minister of Interior in 1792 and was faced with pressure from the National Convention to destroy symbols of the Old Regime. Roland, given the responsibility of simultaneously preserving and destroying art, found his solution in the form of public museums. The museum served as a representation of France's rich artistic heritage. Roland had an idealistic vision for the opening of the Louvre as a means of showcasing the glory and power of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Bette W. Oliver. From Royal to National: The Louvre Museum and the Bibliotheque Nationale (Lantham: Lexington Book, 2007), p. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public museums===
The Louvre was first opened to the public on August 10, 1793. Its collection was almost entirely composed of art from the monarchy's collection in Versailles. Although the radical government's official purpose of installing this art was to "avoid favoritism among artists," the paintings were "secretly held in high regard."&lt;ref&gt;Emmet, Kennedy. A Cultural History of the French Revolution. (New Haven: Yale UP, 1989): pp. 221, 223&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics believed that the art from the royalist era was superior to the work of contemporary artists and therefore believed that the works served a greater historical and aesthetic purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Emmet 1989, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; These artistic symbols of "royalty, feudalism, and superstition" lost their significance in the passive and detached environment of the Louvre.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley J. Idzerda, "Iconoclasm during the French Revolution." In The American Historical Review, Vol. 60, No. 1 (Oct., 1954), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Louvre, along with other French museums, was a compromise between the political push to preserve and destroy art. Consequently, the museum represented one form of iconoclasm, as it destroyed the essence and meaning of artistic images while preserving its physical form. French museums stripped art of its culturally specific meaning, separating the great artworks from their potentially counterrevolutionary context. Subsequently, politically controversial works were allowed to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. "Of Other Spaces." Diacritics. (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the museum freed images from their intended symbolic meaning and allowed French citizens to appreciate the art merely for its aesthetic and technical characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, Gilles, and Felix Guattari. A Thousand Plateaus. (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1987): 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum houses, defends, preserves, and abstracts by its very nature, and as such, was one of the most significant architectural and conceptual structures to have been conceived in the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;de Certeau, Michel. The Practice of Everyday Life. (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1984): 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Premier Musée des Monuments opened to the public in the year 1795, having been commissioned in October of 1790 to hold artworks collected by the revolutionary government. It eventually became one of the most popular museums in Europe. Its curator, Alexandre Lenoir, preserved religious sculptures and tombs for his museum. He was able to preserve relics of the feudal system by convincing revolutionary leaders of their stylistic merit, and minimizing reverence toward the societies the works portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Christopher M., "Alexandre Lenoir and the Musée des monuments français during the French Revolution," French Historical Studies 12, no. 2 (1981): p. 200–222.&lt;/ref&gt; "Revolutionary museums did not so much eliminate meanings as provide new ones." &lt;ref&gt;Greene 1981, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1451 AD, the temple was once again destroyed by Mahmud Begda, the Sultan of Gujarat.&lt;ref name="Leaves from the past"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gujaratindia.com"/&gt; In 1701 AD, the temple was once again destroyed by Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]].&lt;ref name="Leaves from the past"/&gt; Aurangzeb built a mosque on the site of the Somnath temple, using some columns from the temple, whose Hindu sculptural motifs remained visible.

[[Mahmud of Ghazni]] was an [[Demography of Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[Sultan]] who invaded the Indian subcontinent during the early 11th century. His campaigns across the [[gangetic plains]] are often cited for their iconoclastic plundering and destruction of temples such as those at [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] and he looked upon their destruction as an act of ''"[[jihad]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Historical records compiled by Muslim historian Maulana Hakim Saiyid Abdul Hai attest to the iconoclasm of [[Qutb-ud-din Aybak]]. The first mosque built in Delhi, the "[[Qutb complex#Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque|Quwwat al-Islam]]" was built after the demolition of the Hindu temple built previously by Prithvi Raj and certain parts of the temple were left outside the mosque proper.&lt;ref name="Hai"&gt;Maulana Hakim Saiyid Abdul Hai "Hindustan Islami Ahad Mein" (Hindustan under Islamic rule), Eng Trans by Maulana Abdul Hasan Nadwi.&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern of iconoclasm was common during his reign, although an argument goes that such iconoclasm was motivated more by politics than by religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routes/1200_1299/index_1200_1299.html Index_1200-1299],''Columbia.edu''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ruler of the sultanate, Shams-ud-din [[Iltutmish]], conquered and subjugated the Hindu pilgrimage site [[Varanasi]] in the 11th century and he continued the destruction of Hindu temples and idols that had begun during the first attack in 1194.&lt;ref&gt;

No aspect of Aurangzeb's reign is more cited—or more controversial—than the numerous desecrations and even the destruction of Hindu temples.&lt;ref name="Aurangzeb"&gt;[http://www.the-south-asian.com/Dec2000/Aurangzeb.htm The South Asian] ''Aurangzeb profile''.&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign, tens of thousands of temples were desecrated: their facades and interiors were defaced and their murtis (divine images) looted.&lt;ref name="Aurangzeb"/&gt; In many cases, temples were destroyed entirely; in numerous instances mosques were built on their foundations, sometimes using the same stones. Among the temples Aurangzeb destroyed were two that are most sacred to Hindus, in [[Varanasi]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]].&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"&gt;[http://www.hindunet.org/hindu_history/modern/temple_aurangzeb.html Rajiv Varma] ''Destruction of Hindu Temples by Aurangzeb.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, he had large mosques built on the sites.&lt;ref name="Aurangzeb"/&gt;

[[File:Benares well.jpg|thumb|The original holy well – Gyanvapi in between temple and mosque.]]
The [[Kesava Deo]] temple in [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], marked the place that Hindus believe was the birthplace of Shri [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"/&gt; In 1661 Aurangzeb ordered the demolition of the temple, and constructed the Katra Masjid mosque. Traces of the ancient Hindu temple can be seen from the back of the mosque. Aurangzeb also destroyed what was the most famous temple in [[Varanasi]] – the [[Vishwanath Temple]].&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"/&gt;

The temple had changed its location over the years, and in 1585 [[Akbar]] had authorized its location at Gyan Vapi. Aurangzeb ordered its demolition in 1669 and constructed a mosque on the site, whose minarets stand 71&amp;nbsp;metres above the Ganges. Traces of the old temple can be seen behind the mosque. Centuries later, emotional debate about these wanton acts of cultural desecration continues. [[Aurangzeb]] also destroyed the [[Somnath]] temple in 1706.&lt;ref name="Mughaltemples"/&gt;

[[Hindu nationalists]] claim that Mughals destroyed the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|Ram Mandir]] in [[Ayodhya]], located at the birthplace of [[Rama]], and built the [[Babri Masjid]] on the holy site, which has since been a source of tension between the Hindu and Muslim communities.

Writer Fernand Braudel wrote in ''A History of Civilizations'' (Penguin 1988/1963, pp.&amp;nbsp;232–236), Islamic rule in India as a "colonial experiment" was "extremely violent", and "the Muslims could not rule the country except by systematic terror. Cruelty was the norm – burnings, summary executions, crucifixions or impalements, inventive tortures. Hindu temples were destroyed to make way for mosques. On occasion there were forced conversions. If ever there were an uprising, it was instantly and savagely repressed: houses were burned, the countryside was laid waste, men were slaughtered and women were taken as slaves."

===During Goa inquisitions===
Diago de Boarda, a priest, and his advisor Vicar General, Miguel Vaz, had made a 41-point plan for torturing Hindus. Under this plan Viceroy Antano de Noronha issued in 1566, an order applicable to the entire area under Portuguese rule:&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgweb.org/unethicalconversion/GoaInquisition.htm |title=The Goa Inquisition by Christian Historian Dr. T. R. de Souza |publisher=Vgweb.org |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I hereby order that in any area owned by my master, the king, nobody should construct a Hindu temple and such temples already constructed should not be repaired without my permission. If this order is transgressed, such temples shall be, destroyed and the goods in them shall be used to meet expenses of holy deeds, as punishment of such transgression.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1567 the campaign of destroying temples in Bardez met with success. At the end of it 300 Hindu temples were destroyed. In 1583 Hindu temples at [[Assolna]] and [[Cuncolim]] were destroyed through army action.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties the use of their own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with the people that they abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshipped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers&lt;/blockquote&gt;,

wrote [[Filippo Sassetti]], who was in India from 1578 to 1588.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

An order was issued in June 1684 eliminating the [[Konkani language]] and making it compulsory to speak [[Portuguese language]].  Following that law all the symbols of non-Christian sects were destroyed and the books written in local languages were burnt.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

==Contemporary iconoclasm against Hindu temples and monuments==

===In India===
On December 6, 1992, a large crowd of Hindu Karsevaks (volunteers) entirely destroyed the 16th-century Babri mosque in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India, in an attempt to reclaim the land known as Ram Janmabhoomi. The demolition occurred after a religious ceremony turned violent and resulted in several months of intercommunal rioting between India's Hindu and Muslim communities, causing the death of at least 2,000 people most of which were Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11436552 | work=BBC News | title=Timeline: Ayodhya holy site crisis | date=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Pakistan===
{{Further|Decline of Hinduism in Pakistan}}
Several Hindu temples have been destroyed in Pakistan. A notable incident was the destruction of the [[Ramna Kali Mandir]] in former [[East Pakistan]]. The temple was bulldozed by the Pakistani Army on March 27, 1971. The [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] was severely damaged during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and over half of the temple's buildings were destroyed. In a major disrespect of the religion, the main worship hall was taken over by the [[Pakistan]] Army and used as an ammunitions storage area. Several of the temple custodians were tortured and killed by the Army though most, including the Head Priest, fled first to their ancestral villages and then to India and therefore escaped death.

In 2006 the last Hindu temple in [[Lahore]] was destroyed to pave the way for construction of a multi-story commercial building. The temple was demolished after officials of the Evacuee Property Trust Board concealed facts from the board chairman about the nature of the building. When reporters from Pakistan-based newspaper ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'' tried to cover the incident, they were accosted by the henchmen of the property developer, who denied that a Hindu temple existed at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2006/05/28/nat23.htm Another temple is no more], ''Dawn''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several political parties in Pakistan have objected to this move, such as the Pakistan People's Party and the Pakistani Muslim League-N.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.rediff.com/news/2006/jun/13temple.htm Hindu temple in Lahore demolished],''Rediff.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-06-13/pakistan/27788614_1_hindu-temple-hindus-and-sikhs-eptb Only Hindu Temple in Lahore demolished],''Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; The move has also evoked strong condemnation in India from minority bodies and political parties, including the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]], as well as Muslim advocacy political parties such as the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1651762.cms India protests demolition of Hindu temple in Pak], ''Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; A firm of lawyers representing the Hindu minority has approached the Lahore High Court seeking a directive to the builders to stop the construction of the commercial plaza and reconstruct the temple at the site. The petitioners maintain that the demolition violates section 295 of the Pakistan Penal Code prohibiting the demolition of places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/06/16/10047337.html Order for temple's reconstruction sought],''Gulf News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of a deal negotiated between Islamic religious leaders and the Hindu/Christian communities, Pakistani police later released all previously arrested perpetrators without charge.&lt;ref name="usdep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71443.htm |title=US Department of State International Religious Freedom Report 2006 |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Malaysia===
Between April to May 2006, several Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/opinionsfeatures/52600 Temple row – a dab of sensibility please], ''malaysiakini.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatago.com/talk/politics/mideast/12428067.html Muslims Destroy Century-Old Hindu Temple,''gatago.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built "illegally". However, several of the temples are centuries old.&lt;ref name="Finexp"&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 Hindu group protests "temple cleansing" in Malaysia], ''Financial Express''.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, 2006, armed city hall officers from [[Kuala Lumpur]] forcefully demolished part of a 60-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 1,000 Hindus.&lt;ref name="Finexp"/&gt;

===In Fiji===
In Fiji according to official reports, attacks on Hindu institutions increased by 14% compared to 2004. This intolerance of Hindus has found expression in anti-Hindu speeches and destruction of temples, the two most common forms of immediate and direct violence against Hindus. Between 2001 and April 2005, one hundred cases of temple attacks have been registered with the police. The alarming increase of temple destruction has spread fear and intimidation among the Hindu minorities and has hastened immigration to neighboring Australia and New Zealand. Organized religious institutions, such as the Methodist Church of Fiji, have repeatedly called for the creation of a theocratic Christian State and have propagated anti-Hindu sentiment.&lt;ref name="Hindusin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hafsite.org/pdf/hhr_2005_html/fijiislands.htm |title=Hindus in South Asia and the Diaspora: A Survey of Human Rights 2005 |publisher=Hafsite.org |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; State favoritism of Christianity, and systematic attacks on temples, are some of the greatest threats faced by Fijian Hindus.

===Chinese iconoclasm===
{{further|Anti-Western sentiment in China}}
There have been [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|a number of anti-Buddhist campaigns]] in [[Chinese history]] that led to the destruction of [[Buddhist temple]]s and images. One of the most notable of these campaigns was the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]] of the [[Tang dynasty]].

During and after the [[Xinhai Revolution]], there was widespread destruction of religious and secular images in [[China]].

During the [[Northern Expedition]] in [[Guangxi]] in 1926, [[Kuomintang]] General [[Bai Chongxi]] led his troops in destroying Buddhist temples and smashing Buddhist images, turning the temples into schools and Kuomintang party headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=pai%20smashing%20idols%20decapitating%20statues&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=98|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that almost all of the [[vihara]]s in Guangxi were destroyed and the [[bhikkhu|monks]] were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxDUeWdMubkC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=bai+chongxi+buddhist+temples#v=onepage&amp;q=bai%20chongxi%20buddhist%20temples&amp;f=false|title=Toward a modern Chinese Buddhism: Taixu's reforms|author=Don Alvin Pittman|year=2001|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=|page=146|isbn=0-8248-2231-5|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bai also led a wave of anti-foreignism in Guangxi, attacking Americans, Europeans, and other foreigners, and generally making the province unsafe for foreigners and [[missionaries]]. Westerners fled from the province and some [[Chinese Christians]] were also attacked as imperialist agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=snippet&amp;q=missionary%20crowd&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=99|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three goals of the movement were anti-foreignism, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[anti-religion]]. Bai led the anti-religious movement against [[superstition]]. [[Huang Shaohong]], also a Kuomintang member of the [[New Guangxi clique]], supported Bai's campaign. The anti-religious campaign was agreed upon by all Guangxi Kuomintang members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=accused+chiang+feudal&amp;q=muslim#v=onepage&amp;q=pai's%20as%20a%20moslem%20other%20religions&amp;f=false|title=Region and nation: the Kwangsi clique in Chinese politics, 1925–1937|author=Diana Lary|year=1974|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=|page=99|isbn=0-521-20204-3|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was extensive destruction of religious and secular imagery in [[Tibet]] after it was [[Chinese expedition to Tibet (1910)|invaded]] and [[occupation of Tibet|occupied]] by China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9376-6_23|title=The Changing World Religion Map|last=Karan|first=P.

Many religious and secular images were destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]] of 1966-1976, ostensibly because they were a holdover from China's traditional and capitalist past (which the Communist regime led by [[Mao Zedong]] reviled). The Cultural Revolution included widespread destruction of historic artworks in public places and private collections, whether religious or secular. Objects in state museums were mostly left intact.

===Iconoclasm in Eastern Europe===
[[File:Christ saviour explosion.jpg|thumb|Demolition of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Moscow]], 5 December 1931]]
During and after the [[October Revolution]], widespread destruction of religious and secular imagery took place, as well as the destruction of imagery related to [[House of Romanov|the Imperial family]]. The Revolution was accompanied by destruction of monuments of past [[tsar]]s, as well as the destruction of [[Coat of arms of Russia|imperial eagles]] at various locations throughout [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. According to Christopher Wharton, "In front of a Moscow cathedral, crowds cheered as the enormous statue of Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander&amp;nbsp;III]] was bound with ropes and gradually beaten to the ground. After a considerable amount of time, the statue was decapitated and its remaining parts were broken into rubble".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Wharton, [http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=2514&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4797 "The Hammer and Sickle: The Role of Symbolism and Rituals in the Russian Revolution"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528035402/http://www.westminstercollege.edu/myriad/index.cfm?parent=2514&amp;detail=4475&amp;content=4797 |date=2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] actively destroyed religious sites, including [[Russian Orthodox]] churches and [[Jewish cemeteries]], in order to discourage religious practice and curb the activities of religious groups.
 
During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and during the [[Revolutions of 1989]], protesters often attacked and took down sculptures and images of [[Joseph Stalin]], such as the [[Stalin Monument (Budapest)|Stalin Monument]] in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Auyezov|first=Olzhas|title=Ukraine says blowing up Stalin statue was terrorism|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/05/us-ukraine-stalin-idUSTRE7043D920110105|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of communism in 1989 was also followed by the destruction or removal of statues of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other Communist leaders in the [[former Soviet Union]] and in other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. Particularly well-known was the destruction of "[[Felix Dzerzhinsky#Iron Felix|Iron Felix]]", the statue of [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] outside the [[KGB]]'s headquarters. Another statue of Dzerzhinsky was destroyed in a [[Warsaw]] square that was named after him during [[communist Poland|communist rule]], but which is now called [[Bank Square, Warsaw|Bank Square]].

Other examples of political destruction of images include:
* During the [[American Revolution]], the [[Sons of Liberty]] pulled down and destroyed the [[gilding|gilded]] lead statue of [[George&amp;nbsp;III of the United Kingdom]] on [[Bowling Green (New York City)]], melting it down to be recast as [[Musket#Ammunition|ammunition]]. Similar acts have accompanied the independence of most ex-colonial territories.  Sometimes relatively intact monuments are moved to a collected display in a less prominent place, as in India and also post-Communist countries.
* From the 16th through the 19th centuries, many of the polytheistic religious deities and texts of pre-colonial Americas, Oceania and Africa were destroyed by Christian missionaries and their converts, such as during the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] and the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]].
* In 1942 the pro-Nazi [[Vichy France|Vichy Government of France]] took down and melted Clothilde Roch's statue of the 16th-century dissident  intellectual [[Michael Servetus]], who had been burned at the stake in [[Geneva]] at the instigation of [[John Calvin|Calvin]]. The Vichy authorities disliked the statue, as it was a celebration of freedom of conscience. In 1960, having found the original molds, the municipality of Annemasse had it recast and returned the statue to its previous place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Goldstone, Nancy Bazelon |author2=Goldstone, Lawrence |title=Out of the Flames: The Remarkable Story of a Fearless Scholar, a Fatal Heresy, and One of the Rarest Books in the World |publisher=Broadway |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-7679-0837-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}pp. 313-316&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In a Persian Market''''' is a piece of [[Light music|light classical music]] for orchestra with optional chorus by [[Albert Ketèlbey]] who composed it in 1920. Subtitled ''Intermezzo Scene'', it was published by Bosworth in 1921. It evokes exotic images of camel-drivers, jugglers, and snake-charmers. When it was first published in a version for piano, it was advertised as an "educational novelty".

== Theme and music ==
A synopsis of scenes by the composer mentions a [[Camel train|caravan]] arriving, beggars, a princess carried by servants, jugglers, snake-charmers, and a caliph.&lt;ref name="Details" /&gt; After the princess and the caliph have left, a [[muezzin]] calls to prayer from a minaret. The caravan continues its journey, and the market becomes silent.&lt;ref name="Details" /&gt; The duration is around six minutes.&lt;ref name="Recording" /&gt;

An opening march shares "exotic" [[Interval (music)|intervals]], A – B-flat – E, with the composer's [[Orientalism#In music|oriental]] intermezzo ''Wonga'', used for the play ''Ye Gods'' in 1916.&lt;ref name="Naxos" /&gt; A chorus of beggars sings: "[[Baksheesh]], baksheesh [[Allah]]"; passers-by sing "Empshi" ("get away").&lt;ref name="Hyperion" /&gt; A romantic [[Theme (music)|theme]] portrays the princess, similar to Stravinsky's ''[[The Firebird|Firebird]]''.&lt;ref name="Naxos" /&gt; Trumpets announce the caliph.&lt;ref name="Details" /&gt; The concluding section "Call to prayer" of 22 measures was added later.&lt;ref name="Naxos" /&gt;

== Publishing and reception ==
The music was first announced in ''Musical Opinion'' in January 1921 as a piano piece, in a section "Educational novelties”.&lt;ref name="Details" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCanna" /&gt; Half a year later, Bosworth printed the orchestral version.&lt;ref name="Details" /&gt;

''In a Persian Market'' has been regarded as a work of orchestral [[Impressionism in music|impressionism]]. The work has been used as theatre music for comic oriental scenes,&lt;ref name="Jameson" /&gt; used in sketches by [[Morecambe and Wise]], and by [[The Two Ronnies]],&lt;ref name="Hyperion" /&gt; and also in schools as theatrical repertory.&lt;ref name="Naxos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jameson" /&gt;

== Selected recordings ==
''In a Persian Market'' was recorded completely, with chorus, in 1999 by the New London Light Opera Chorus and the [[New London Orchestra]], conducted by [[Ronald Corp]].&lt;ref name="Hyperion" /&gt; It is part of a 2002 recording of the same name, an anthology of historic recordings of works by Ketèlbey performed by different ensembles and conductors (including the composer) made between 1917 and 1939.&lt;ref name="Recording" /&gt;
Also music was used in "My Lady Heroine" by French singer serge Gainsbourg.

The '''League of the Left-Wing Writers''' ({{zh|t=中國左翼作家聯盟|p=Zhōngguó Zuǒyì Zuòjiā Liánméng}}), commonly abbreviated as the '''Zuolian''' or '''Left League''', was an organization of writers formed in [[Shanghai]], China, on 2 March 1930, at the instigation of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and the influence of the celebrated author [[Lu Xun]]. Other prominent members included [[Ding Ling]], [[Hu Feng]], and [[Mei Zhi]].&lt;ref name=sina&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2008-03-12/113615131996.shtml | title=张晓风：我的父亲母亲 | trans-title=Zhang Xiaofeng: My father and mother | language=Chinese | last1=Zhang 张 | first1=Xiaofeng 晓风 | website=Sina | date=12 March 2008 | access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the League was to promote [[socialist realism]] in support of the Communist Revolution, and it eventually became very influential in Chinese cultural circles. Lu Xun delivered the opening address to the organizational meeting, but he became disillusioned when it quickly became clear that he would have little influence.&lt;ref name="CAM"&gt;Leo Oufan Lee,  "Literary Trends: The Road to Revolution 1927-1949," Ch 9 in {{cite book | last1=Fairbank | first1=John King | last2=Feuerwerker | first2=Albert | last3=Twitchett | first3=Denis Crispin | title= The Cambridge history of China |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fxs3ROaIhPMC&amp;pg=PA428 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, England | year=1986 | ISBN=9780521243384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members included leaders of the [[Sun Society]] and the [[Creation Society]], and [[Zhou Yang (literary theorist)|Zhou Yang]], who became [[Mao Zedong]]'s favorite literary figure and after 1949 zealously enforced  political orthodoxy. The League articulated theories on the political role of literature that foreshadowed Mao's influential [[Yan'an Talks on Literature and Art]], and engaged in running debates with the "art for art's sake" [[Crescent Moon Society]].{{sfnb|Spence|1981|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=DwgvjqO5ivUC&amp;pg=PA1977-IA59&amp;dq=goldman+literary+dissent&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=40V_VIzsOsv3yQSUx4CYBg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Left%20wing%20league&amp;f=false]}}

Due to the League's prominent political views, it was quickly banned by the [[Kuomintang]] government. On 7 February 1931, the government executed five members of the League: [[Li Weisen]], [[Hu Yepin]], [[Rou Shi]], [[Yin Fu (writer)|Yin Fu]], and [[Feng Keng]]. They are known as the [[Five Martyrs of the League of Left-Wing Writers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wong |first=Lawrence Wang-Chi |title=Politics and Literature in Shanghai: The Chinese League of Left-Wing Writers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-FRAQAAIAAJ |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-7190-2924-4 |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The League was disbanded voluntarily in 1936. This was mainly in order to encourage authors to unite across political boundaries and face the rapidly increasing threat from Japan.

{{Dynamic list}}

The following is a list of fiction employing [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes or alternate realities]].

==Books==
* [[Margaret Cavendish]], Duchess of Newcastle, wrote ''[[The Blazing World]]'' (1666), a book far ahead of its time, in which the heroine passes through a portal near the North Pole to a world with different stars in the sky and talking animals.
* [[Ludvig Holberg]], Danish-Norwegian author, historian and philosopher, wrote ''[[Niels Klim's Underground Travels]]'' (in Latin as Nicolai Klimii iter subterraneum, 1741). The hero Niels Klim slips into a cave and reaches Nazar, a planet inside the hollow Earth, where societies and beings represent  satirical comments to existing contemporary ones.
* [[Edwin Abbott Abbott|Edwin Abott Abbott]], mathematician and theologian, wrote ''[[Flatland]]'' (1884), also known as ''Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions''. It recounts the story of a two-dimensional world inhabited by living geometric figures: triangles, squares, circles, etc., and explores concepts of other dimensions (or universes) including Pointland, Lineland, and Spaceland. A feature film adaptation of this novella was made in 2007, called ''[[Flatland (2007 film)|Flatland]]''.
* [[H. G. Wells]] wrote what is apparently the first explicit paratime novel, ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923), complete with a multiverse theory and a paratime machine.
* [[Murray Leinster]]'s story "[[Sidewise in Time]]" (1934), showing different parts of the Earth somehow occupied by different parallel universes, was influential in science fiction.
* [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s ''[[Star Maker]]'' from 1937 describes God (called the Star Maker) evolving by creating many cosmoses, each more complex than the previous.
*In [[C. S. Lewis]]' classic ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series (1950–1956) children come and go between our world and Narnia, a land populated by talking animals. In ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' the Wood between the Worlds gives access to several worlds.  In ''[[The Last Battle]]'' it transpires that all the worlds are joined together by a form of [[heaven]].
* [[Ward Moore]]'s ''[[Bring the Jubilee ]]'' describes  the Confederacy winning the American Civil War. This 1953 novel was well received and influenced Philp K. Dick’s Man in a High Castle.
* [[Andre Norton]]'s ''[[The Crossroads of Time]]'' is a science-fiction novel written by Andre Norton and first published in 1956 by Ace Books. The story takes its protagonist through several versions of Earth as it might have been if history had gone a little differently. The book has been translated into Spanish, Italian, and German. Tacitly postulating a kind of two-dimensional time, Norton anticipated Hugh Everett III's many-worlds interpretation of the quantum theory by one year. She called it the "possibility worlds" theory of history.
* [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' (1962) is an alternate history novel.
*In ''[[The Man Who Folded Himself]]'' (1973) by [[David Gerrold]], paradoxes caused by [[time travel]] result in the creation of multiple universes.
* [[Piers Anthony]] wrote the "[[Of Man and Manta]]" series (''Omnivore'', ''Orn'', and ''Ox'', 1968–76) in which a group of three scientists explores worlds in parallel universes.
* [[Tonke Dragt]]'s novel "The Towers of February" (De torens van februari, 1973) is a [[Bildungsroman|coming-of-age novel]] in diary form for young adults, about a boy who slowly discovers that his memory loss is due to having passed into a parallel universe. The difficulty to travel between both worlds can be seen as symbolic for reaching adulthood and can be taken literal at the same time.
* [[Michael Coney]] ''[[Charisma]]'' 1975 A murder mystery which involves the main character John Maine traveling to different parallel worlds, but the only worlds he can travel to are the ones in which his 'other self' is dead.
* [[Michael Ende]]'s novel ''[[The Neverending Story]]'' (De unendliche Geschichte, 1979) is a portal-story where the detoriation of fantasy (and of lies) among humans of Earth both influates (and stem from) what happens in the magical world of Fantastica. The protagonist reads the story of this world in a book until he understands that he may take part in and save it, and eventually the imagination of Earth. 
* [[David Brin]] wrote ''[[The Practice Effect]]'' (1984), which is the story of a scientific researcher who finds themselves stranded in an alternate dimension that has unique natural laws that allow objects to become improved as they are used, rather than degrade.
* [[Terry Pratchett]] and [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] wrote ''[[The Long Earth]]'' (2012), the first of a series of novels about a (possibly infinite) series of parallel worlds that are similar to Earth.
* [[H. Beam Piper]], the author of the ''[[Paratime]]'' series, wrote several stories dealing with alternate realities based on points of divergence far in the past.  The stories are usually written from the perspective of a law-enforcement outfit from a parallel reality which is charged to protect the secret of temporal transposition.
* "[[Convolutions]]", a novella by [[Vashti Daise]], gradually reveals that the two main teenage characters exist in overlapping universes, and when they discover a paradise-like third universe, they can't help but be tempted to escape the struggles of their worlds.
* [[Fredric Brown]]'s ''[[What Mad Universe]]'' recounts the adventures of a science-fiction editor of the late 1940s who is thrown into a parallel universe that reflects the fantasies of his most annoying letter-to-the-editor writer (an adolescent male, naturally).
* [[Isaac Asimov]]'s novel ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' depicts scientists in our universe who find a way to "import" matter from another universe, with unforeseen consequences. "[[The End of Eternity]]," also by Asimov, likewise deals with the existence of and interactions between multiple timelines, though these multiple interacting universes are depicted as the result of meddling in a single timeline by outside entities (the "eternals"), and therefore do not exist simultaneously, as do those in "The Gods Themselves."
* [[K. A. Applegate]]'s series, ''[[Everworld]]'' (1999–2001): Several teenagers travel into a parallel world occupied by the mythological beings of Earth.
* [[Brandon Mull]]'s series, ''Beyonders'' (2011-2013): Depicts the multiverse as being divided into an enormous set of "normal" universes, including ours (the beyond), and one intelligently created universe set apart from all others (Lyrian). It's strongly implied in the novels that it's only possible to travel from the "beyond" to Lyrian, or from Lyrian to the beyond.
* [[Stephen King]]'s series ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' has doors that send travelers to different parallel Earths, or, as termed in the story, different levels of the Tower. King also frequently utilizes this idea in other stories, such as ''[[The Mist]]'', ''[[From A Buick 8]]'', ''[[The Talisman (King &amp; Straub novel)|The Talisman]]'', ''[[Black House (novel)|Black House]]'' and ''[[Insomnia (novel)|Insomnia]]''.
* [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novel ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'' is focused around a 'time machine' that also proves to be able to travel sideways and other directions in time, allowing for crossing into other realities, even ones previously considered fictional by the protagonists.
* [[S. M. Stirling]]'s novel ''[[Conquistador (novel)|Conquistador]]'' is based on travel between parallel universes, with a group of 20th century Americans having found a means to secretly colonize a world where civilization never advanced past the classical era.
*''[[Globus Cassus]]'' is a book describing a [[utopian]] project for a universe contrary to ours, it describes an [[antipodes|antipode]] to the 'real' world.
*''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' by [[Robert Jordan]] series the world of dreams, and the Mirror Worlds which represent what could have been had various events in history happened in different ways.
* [[Diana Wynne Jones]]' ''[[Chrestomanci]]'' series revolves around the duty of the Chrestomanci to regulate magic in the twelve related worlds.  These worlds have alternate histories, in which some people may exist only in a few worlds. Other works of Jones' that include parallel universes: The ''Magid'' series; ''[[Deep Secret]]'' and ''[[The Merlin Conspiracy]]'' in which the multiverse is shaped like an infinity sign and contains Ayewards and Naywards.  The ''Derkholm'' series: ''[[Dark Lord of Derkholm]]'' and its sequel ''[[Year of the Griffin]]'' in which Pilgrims come from a parallel world for Mr. Chesney's offworld tours. In ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]'', though it does not play a major part in the plot, the wizard Howl is actually from our world. In ''[[A Tale of Time City]]'', the main character, Vivian, is kidnapped and taken to Time City, a city out of time and space. Along with her new friends and past kidnappers Jonathan and Sam, she hunts through time and space for the polarites that are gradually being stolen. In ''A Sudden Wild Magic'' a group of benevolent witches set out to stop the magicians of Arth who steal ideas, technology, and innovations from Earth. In ''[[Hexwood]]'', the machine Bannus sucks potential Reigners from all over the universe into the Wood. In ''[[The Homeward Bounders]]'' Jamie is made into a Homeward Bounder by "Them" which means he must constantly travel from world to world until he finds his home again.
* [[John DeChancie]]'s ''[[Castle Perilous]]'' series tells of a huge magical castle containing portals to 144,000 worlds, including Earth.
* [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]'s ''[[Mordant's Need]]'' series, which includes ''The Mirror of Her Dreams'' and ''A Man Rides Through'', follows a heroine who can pass into another world through mirrors.
*In ''[[The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant]]'' series, also by [[Stephen R. Donaldson]], main character Thomas Covenant is transported to another world called [[The Land (Stephen R. Donaldson)|The Land]]. Each time he travels to The Land corresponds to an injury in the real world that leaves him unconscious.
* [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' series (1995–2000) deals with two children who wander through multiple worlds, opening and closing windows between them.  The final book elaborates the same idea (as C.S. Lewis') that all the worlds share a common heaven, and in this case, [[underworld]].
* [[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[Thursday Next]]'' series is set in a parallel universe which is very similar to ours but has (amusingly) different history.  For example, Britain and Russia are still fighting the [[Crimean War]] in 1985.  As the story develops, the world of fiction also emerges as another parallel universe and the characters learn how to move between them.
*The German series ''[[Perry Rhodan]]'' sometimes deals with parallel universes and "pararealities."  Each universe has a "strangeness" value that indicates to what extent its physical laws differ from those of our universe.  Travel to another universe results in a "strangeness shock" that can disable electronics and leave intelligent beings unconscious for some time.
*In [[L. Neil Smith]]'s ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' series of novels' characters from several different universes end up in one universe where American history took a different turn in the aftermath of the Revolution, with [[Albert Gallatin]] assisting the western Pennsylvania farmers of the [[Whiskey Rebellion]], which culminates in [[George Washington]]'s execution and the rise of a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] republic under a revised [[Articles of Confederation]].
*In [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]]'s ''Paths to Otherwhere'' (1996),  scientists at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] create a machine QUADAR which allow them to swap conscious with people in parallel universes.  They explore various parallel universes.
*In [[Kia Asamiya]]'s manga novel ''Space Battleship Nadesico'', written alongside the series ''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]'' but altering severely as the course of the story runs, the Jupiterians that are attacking Earth come from a parallel universe, the portal of which is in the red storm visible on Jupiter as a red spot. In their world, Japan won World War II, and because of their strong religious Shinto beliefs, their Gods did not die out, and they were able to use this magic to help strengthen their technology. However, their sun died out prematurely, and so they have come to our world to steal the energy from our sun to save their world.
* [[Neil Gaiman]]'s novella [[Coraline]] deals with a parallel universe called the "Other World" in which Coraline's surroundings are the same but the people who are supposed to be her parents are actually evil impostors.  The novella spawned a [[Coraline (film)|film of the same name]] that deals with the same plot and use of parallel universes.
* [[Sergey Lukyanenko]]'s novel ''[[Rough Draft (novel)|Rough Draft]]'' (2005) takes place across the multiverse of at least 22 worlds (it was implied that there were actually more worlds that haven't been discovered yet) linked together by a series of tower-like transfer points.
*''[[I, Q]]'' is a 2000 [[Star Trek]] novel by [[Peter David]] and [[John de Lancie]] in which God attempts to destroy the multiverse in a large multi-universe maelstrom which the protagonists attempt to stop from within a newly created universe caused by the maelstrom.
*In [[D. J. MacHale]]'s ''[[The Pendragon Adventure]]'' series there are ten different parallel universes (including our own), called territories, that are part of Halla, which is described as being every time and place that ever existed. Certain people, called Travelers, are able to go between the territories through portals known as Flumes. It is claimed that by traveling through a Flume, Travelers land on their destination territory exactly when they need to be there, suggesting time travel.
*In [[Robert J Sawyer]]'s ''[[Neanderthal Parallax]]'' series (2003) a parallel historical universe exists in which it was [[Neanderthals]] not Homo sapiens who survived to become the dominant species. In a quantum physics experiment gone wrong a Neanderthal scientist is accidentally transported into the universe of Homo sapiens.
* [[Michael Lawrence (writer)|Michael Lawrence]]'s ''The Aldous Lexicon'' (2005–2007), comprising ''A Crack in the Line'', ''Small Eternities'' and ''The Underwood See'', concerns comings and goings between initially two, later many parallel realities.
*In ''Mirror Dreams'' (2002) and ''Mirror Wakes'' (2003) by [[Catherine Webb]], there are mirror universes, one a magical universe where technology barely works, the other a scientific universe where magic barely works. The inhabitants can physically visit each other's worlds in dreams.
*In the ''[[Stravaganza]]'' series by Mary Hoffman various people travel between present-day [[England]] and an alternative, somewhat magical [[Renaissance Italy]] called Talia.
*In the [[Alastair Reynolds]] novel ''[[Absolution Gap]]'', (2003) a race called the "Shadows" drives the action. They claim to be from a parallel universe which has been overrun by a rogue terraforming system that has destroyed their entire universe. They have sent instructions to our world on how to build machinery to let them across.
*In ''[[The Divide trilogy]]'' by [[Elizabeth Kay]] (2002–2006), Felix Sanders crosses into a parallel universe where magic and magical beings exist while science and human beings are considered mythical.
* [[Andrew Crumey]]'s novel ''[[Mobius Dick]]'' (2004) features a parallel world in which Nazi Germany invaded Britain and [[Erwin Schrödinger]] failed to find the quantum theory equation that bears his name. The parallel worlds become connected due to experiments with quantum computers. The same alternate world (in which post-war Britain falls under Communist rule) also appears in his novels ''Music, in a Foreign Language'' (1994) and ''[[Sputnik Caledonia]]'' (2008).
*In [[Darren Shan]]'s ''[[Demonata]]'' series (2005–) a boy can open windows to parallel worlds with his hands. A part of the story also plays in one of these parallel worlds, the Demonata.
* [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[Crosstime Traffic]]'' series of books (2003–2008) by [[Harry Turtledove]] centers on an Earth that has discovered access to alternate universes where history went differently. "Crosstime Traffic" is the name of the company with a global monopoly on the technology.
*''[[Pet Force]]'', a series of children's books by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] and a spinoff of [[Garfield]], one of his comic strips. The series contains five novels and takes place in a parallel universe and features alternate versions of the comic strip's main characters.
* [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[Timeline (novel)|Timeline]]'' (1999) tells the story of historians who travel to the Middle Ages to save a friend of theirs who already traveled back in time before them. The book follows in Crichton's long history of combining technical details and action in his books, addressing quantum physics and time travel. The time travel mechanism incorporates the concept of the multiverse.
* [[Greg Egan]]'s ''[[Diaspora (novel)|Diaspora]]'' is a novel about sentient software intelligences living inside computer "polises" who undertake expeditions throughout the multiverse.
* [[Alan Dean Foster]]'s ''[[Spellsinger]]'' series concerns a 20th-century college student who finds himself transported to a world populated by [[sentience|sentient]] animals and featuring magic, which he learns how to perform himself through a guitar-like instrument.
* [[Alan Dean Foster]]'s ''Parallelities'' is a novel about a tabloid reporter whose interview subject inadvertently infects him with a condition making him shift between alternate versions of Los Angeles seemingly at random.
* Three of [[Jack Womack]]'s "Dryco" novels, ''[[Terraplane (novel)|Terraplane]]'', ''[[Elvissey]]'', and ''[[Going, Going, Gone (novel)|Going, Going, Gone]]'', concern an "evil" parallel universe which is also chronologically shifted about fifty years into our past, in which among other things, slavery wasn't abolished until the 20th century, the US government commits genocide in the 1940s and Elvis Presley is a psychopath.
* [[Richard Bach]]'s ''[[One (Richard Bach novel)|One]]'' (2001) is a novel where Bach and his wife Leslie are catapulted into an alternate world, one in which they exist simultaneously in many different incarnations.
*The protagonist of [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[Chronicles of Amber]]'' belongs to a royal family of magician-types who can alter details of the world around them at will. These alterations are known as "walking in Shadow". The farther the desired Shadow-world lies from one's present reality, the more details need to be changed and the longer the walk.
* [[Stephen Lawhead]]'s ''[[Song of Albion]]'' trilogy (published in 1991) tells the tale of a pair of university students who stumble into an alternate world (Albion).
*The conceit of [[Charles Stross]]'s [[Merchant Princes]] series is that the ability to travel between worlds is a recessive trait possessed by a clan of narcotics runners from a medieval world. They travel to an alternate present where the northeast coast of North America has been settled by Norsemen.
*Dark Matter by Blake Crouch (2016)
* [[Daedalus Howell]]'s ''Quantum Deadline'' (published in 2015) finds a reporter helping a boy who claims to be from a parallel universe return using an Easter Egg hidden in a popular mobile phone game. To complicate matters, the name of the reporter is also "Daedalus Howell" and a preface to the book reads "Based on a true story. Somewhere..." making the novel itself something of an alternate reality. (FMRL)
* Road to Eugenica by A.M. Rose is a novel where the main character Drea is actually from another dimension on Earth named Eugenica.
*Kristen Cashore's ''Jane Unlimited'' (published in 2017), contains many genres.  In one section, protagonist Jane experiences the multilverse hinted at throughout the book.

* The ''[[Babylon 5]]'' television movie ''[[Babylon 5: Thirdspace|Thirdspace]]'' involves the discovery of an alternate universe.
* ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', the 1960s fantasy/horror soap opera, introduced the concept of "parallel time" when the main character, Barnabas, witnesses unexplainable changes in a closed off part of his family's house. During one of these changes, he becomes trapped for a time in a parallel world.
* ''[[Star Trek]]'' featured the recurring [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|mirror universe]], a dark reflection of the normal universe in which the regular characters are twisted, self-serving and more than willing to resort to torture and murder to achieve their goals. The mirror universe was introduced in the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', and it also appeared in ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', but was featured most often in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]''.

The 1980–1981 "E-space" trilogy of episodes ("[[Full Circle (Doctor Who)|Full Circle]]", "[[State of Decay]]", and "[[Warriors' Gate]]"). The second series of the 2005 revival of the show made frequent use of the concept beginning with "[[Rise of the Cybermen]]" and "[[The Age of Steel]]", postulating a parallel world with yet another Republic of Great Britain, [[Zeppelins]] filling the sky, and an alternate race of [[Cybermen]] are created. Since the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], travel between parallel universes is supposedly near-impossible, but a breach between the universes makes frequent visits easy in the second series finale "[[Army of Ghosts]]"/"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]". These visits cause increasing damage to the universes and the breach is permanently sealed.
* ''[[Sliders]]'' dealt with a group of mostly-unwilling travellers who ended up "sliding" between various parallel Earths in an attempt to find their way back to their own universe. Plots included an Earth in which the population is controlled through a lottery, an Earth where most of the males were killed by germ warfare, an Earth where dinosaurs are still alive, and an Earth in which the population have been turned into flesh-eating zombies.

Episodes of this type include "[[Doppelgangland]]" and "[[The Wish (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Wish]]."

The reason for this given that there has to be balance in the universe, so there can never be an area where everything is all good and one where it is all bad as this would affect the grand design of life. So for every good thing that the Charmed Ones do for good in this world, it is done for evil in another to keep things balanced. Mostly, everything occurs exactly the same way, mirroring the real world. Some differences are that all [[Whitelighter]]s are [[Darklighter]]s and vice versa, and that The Underworld is a [[Garden of Eden]]-like paradise. [[Barbas (Charmed)|The Demon of Fear]] is the Demon of Hope, and Wyatt Halliwell faces a future in which he turns good one day as opposed to one where he turns evil.

Normally the back-stories of a few champions state about beings coming from another realm whether summoned or invited by summoners (such as a character based on [[Anubis]] named Nasus being pulled from his home planet into Runeterra), or by beings crossing inter-dimensional rifts to arrive in Runeterra (such as void creatures crossing a space anomaly from a lost city named Icathia).
*''[[Legacy of Kain]]''
*''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', Lord Vortech torn rifts into all of the LEGO worlds (and drifted the all of the LEGO greats to planet Earth).
* ''[[Lost Odyssey]]'', four [[immortality|immortal]] protagonists, and one immortal antagonist, are sent from a parallel universe in danger of collapse to observe the game universe's residents and return after a millennium (one year in the parallel universe). The antagonist, wishing to retain his immortality, erases the others' memories and plots to destroy the link between the worlds.
* ''[[Marathon Infinity]]'', a seemingly unstoppable creature, The W'rkncacnter, is unleashed, and the player must transport himself to different parallel realities until he finds the one in which he may prevent the release of the creature. In certain levels the player will appear before the release of the creature, and can then attempt to stop it. Every few levels, usually at the end of a chapter, the player would find himself in a surreal "dream world", in which his surroundings had little to no relation to the W'rkncacnter or even his original reality at all. It is suspected that these levels are not universes at all, but in fact a dreaming interlude before the player reaches his actual destination (this is debatable however since the player can be killed in these levels like any other). After the player succeeds in trapping the W'rkncacnter in a gigantic gravitational field, he is "freed" from the control of the artificial intelligences that had previously governed nearly every one of his objectives, and subsequently teleports to another reality, at which point the game ends. It is unknown what reality the player goes to next, but it is assumed that he is using his new freedom to explore various universes at his own leisure.
* ''[[Metroid Prime 2: Echoes]]'' features the planet Aether, which is struck by a meteor. The strange, energetic substance (called [[Metroid (series)#Phazon|Phazon]]) within the meteor, along with the force of the impact, split the planet's reality into light and dark dimensions. [[Samus Aran|Samus]], the heroine, must travel between the two dimensions, transferring energy back to the light dimension before the two competing worlds destroy one another.
* ''[[Mortal Kombat (series)|Mortal Kombat series]]'' features a massive war between realities, known as "[[:Category:Realms of Mortal Kombat|Realms]]". This crossed over into the [[DC Universe]] in ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]''.
* ''[[Myst]]'', a people known as [[D'ni]] colonized Earth from another universe, and kept traveling to other universes (known as [[D'ni Ages|Ages]]) through Linking Books. According to their cosmology, each universe is a leaf of the Terokh Jeruth, the Tree of Possibilities. Myst also includes the use of Trap Books as empty universes for storing criminals, although they were later [[retcon]]ned to be complete universes of their own, called Prison Ages.
*''[[Ni no Kuni]]''
* ''[[ParaWorld]]'' is set in a parallel dimension discovered by a group of scientists in the 19th century. This new world is periodically connected to ours via natural gateways. In order to cross into that world, one must predict the exact time and location of the opening rift. ParaWorld is a world where electricity does not and cannot exist, and the word "lightning" is foreign to the natives. As such, technology has not gone beyond steam engines. Most tribes, however, prefer to utilize other means of transportation and warfare – dinosaurs. As discovered by three modern-day scientists who are trapped in ParaWorld, dinosaurs never existed on our Earth, and all the bones found by archaeologists have somehow crossed over through the portals. In ParaWorld, however, they exist alongside human tribes, some of which are similar culturally to ours (e.g. Norsemen, Dustriders (Beduins), and Dragon Clans (East Asia)).
*''[[RuneScape]]'' has a mirror universe named ScapeRune which players can access through certain random events.
* The ''[[Silent Hill]]'' survival horror video game series incorporates an alternate dimension that is related to characters' emotions, memories and other projections of their subconsciousness.
*''[[Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood]]'', ''[[Sonic Rush]]'', and ''[[Sonic Rush Adventure]]''
*''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]''
* [[Spyro the Dragon (series)|''Spyro the Dragon'' series]], an evil sorcerer sends all of the inhabitants of the three realms to their [[Shadow Realm (Spyro)|Shadow Realm]] counterparts, leaving the normal realms empty save for [[Spyro the Dragon (character)|Spyro]].
* ''[[Star Ocean: Till the End of Time]]'', the characters unknowingly live in a "video game" created by people in another universe called 4D Space. Eventually, the creators of the game see fit to reboot the game server, effectively destroying the universe in the process, however, once the process is complete, the characters find the universe as they know it intact, and all links to 4D space inaccessible. Suggesting that by destroying the universe, contact between the two planes of existence was severed, without resulting in the destruction of either plane.
*''[[Star Trek: Shattered Universe]]''
*''[[Super Paper Mario]]''
*''[[Super Smash Bros. (series)|Super Smash Bros.]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''
* ''[[Tales of Symphonia]]'', the two world exist next to each other without knowing of the other's existence. The two worlds unconsciously battle for control of the energy the worlds share, something like ''[[Metroid Prime 2: Echoes]]'', except in that game, the two sides of the war know of each other's existence and the energy they must share.
* [[The Legend of Zelda series|''The Legend of Zelda'' series]] include alternate realities: ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures]]'' include an alternate "Dark World" along with the normal "light" one, and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]'' is set in a parallel reality of [[Hyrule]], [[Termina]]. Other games feature the same world in two different time periods. In ''[[Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'' there is a Twilight Realm where Link becomes a Wolf. In [[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening|Link's Awakening]] there exists a kind of alternate universe inside the unconscious, dream state mind of the Wind Fish. There is also a parallel universe in [[The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass|Phantom Hourglass]] simply called the "World of the Ocean King" by the spirits.
* ''[[The Longest Journey]]'' features a story about two parallel universes, [[Stark (The Longest Journey)|Stark]] and [[Arcadia (The Longest Journey)|Arcadia]]. Stark is a futuristic universe with cyberpunk influences, while Arcadia is a fantastic medieval world.
* ''[[Ultima Online]]'' used the parallel universe concept to rationalize the existence of multiple instances of the game world (called "shards"), so that players could be partitioned onto multiple servers for capacity reasons.
* ''[[Universe (1994 video game)|Universe]]''
*[[Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation]]
*Nonary Games

[[File:Portrait of James I of England and James VI of Scotland.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[James I of England|James VI]] in 1585, aged 19. A major patron of poetry as well as a poet and commentator, his accession to the English throne in 1603 had profound effects on the patronage of Scottish literature and the Scots language]]
'''Literature in early modern Scotland''' is [[Scottish literature|literature]] written in Scotland or by [[List of Scottish writers|Scottish writers]] between the [[Renaissance in Scotland|Renaissance]] in the early sixteenth century and the beginnings of the [[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Industrial Revolution]] in mid-eighteenth century. By the beginning of this era [[Scots Gaelic|Gaelic]] had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the [[Highlands and Islands]], but the tradition of Classic Gaelic Poetry survived. [[Middle Scots]] became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. The establishment of a printing press in 1507 made it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity.

[[James IV of Scotland|James IV]]'s creation of a [[Renaissance]] court included the patronage of poets, or [[makar]]s, who were mainly clerics. These included [[Gavin Douglas]], whose ''[[Eneados]]'' (1513) was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an [[Old English|Anglian]] language. [[James V of Scotland|James V]] was also a major patron of poets. [[George Buchanan]] founded a tradition of neo-Latin poetry. In the reign of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and the [[Minority reign|minority]] of her son [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]], cultural pursuits were limited by the lack of a royal court and by political turmoil. [[Church of Scotland|The Kirk]] discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature but secular poetry survived. In the 1580s and 1590s James VI promoted literature in Scots. He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish court poets and musicians, later called the [[Castalian Band]]. David Lyndsay's ''[[A Satire of the Three Estates|The Thrie Estaitis]]'' (1540) is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation. Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre, but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium. There were isolated Scottish plays, but the system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland.

The accession of James VI to the English throne in 1603 meant a loss of the court as a centre of patronage and he increasingly favoured the language of southern England. A number of Scottish poets accompanied the king to London, where they began to [[anglicise]] their written language. As the tradition of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge, often undertaken by women. The tradition of neo-Latin poetry reached its fruition with the publication of the anthology of the ''Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum'' (1637). This period was marked by the work of the first named female Scottish poets, such as [[Elizabeth Melville]], whose ''Ane Godlie Dream'' (1603) was the first book published by a woman in Scotland. This was the period when the [[ballad]] emerged as a significant written form in Scotland. From the seventeenth century they were used as a literary form by aristocratic authors.

After the Union in 1707, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education. [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] led a "vernacular revival" that laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature. He also led the trend for [[pastoral]] poetry and his pastoral opera ''[[The Gentle Shepherd]]'' was one of the most influential works of the era. Ramsay was part of a community of poets working in Scots and English. [[Tobias Smollett]] was a poet, essayist, satirist and playwright, but is best known for his [[picaresque novel]]s, for which he is often seen as Scotland's first novelist. The early eighteenth century was also a period of innovation in Gaelic vernacular poetry that mixed traditional forms with influences from the Lowlands. Drama was pursued by Scottish playwrights in London. In Scotland drama was supplied by visiting English players and actors, but there were clashes with the Kirk. Ramsay was instrumental in establishing a small theatre in Edinburgh, but it closed soon after the passing of the [[Licensing Act 1737|1737 Licensing Act]]. A new theatre was opened at Cannongate in 1747 and operated without a licence into the 1760s.

==Sixteenth century==

===Background===
[[File:Device_of_Androw_Myllar.png|upright|thumb|The device of the printer [[Androw Myllar|Andrew Myllar]] from ''The Porteous of Nobleness'']]
By the early modern era [[Scots Gaelic|Gaelic]] had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the [[Highlands and Islands]].&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp60-1&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0276-3}}, pp. 60–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of classic Gaelic poetry survived longer in Scotland than in Ireland, with the last fully competent member of the [[MacMhuirich bardic family|MacMhuirich dynasty]], who were hereditary poets to the [[Lords of the Isles]] and then the [[Clan Donald|Donalds of Clanranald]], still working in the early eighteenth century. Nevertheless, interest in the sponsorship of [[panegyric]] Gaelic poetry was declining among the clan leaders.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2001pp255-7&gt;J. MacDonald, "Gaelic literature" in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;255–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaelic was gradually being overtaken by [[Middle Scots]], which became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. Middle Scots was derived substantially from [[Old English]], with Gaelic and French influences. It was usually called ''Inglyshe'' and was very close to the language spoken in northern England,&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp60-1/&gt; but by the sixteenth century it had established [[orthography|orthographic]] and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England.&lt;ref&gt;J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, "A Brief History of Scots" in J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, eds, ''The Edinburgh Companion to Scots'' (Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7486-1596-2}}, p. 9ff.&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing [[Standard English]] of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, McClure and Stuart-Smith, "A Brief History of Scots", p. 10ff.&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came to be done in the English fashion.&lt;ref name="Scots' 2003 p. 11"&gt;Corbett, McClure and Stuart-Smith, "A Brief History of Scots", p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of a printing press under royal patent in 1507 would begin to make it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity.&lt;ref name=Bawcutt&amp;Williams2006pp26-9&gt;P.

Although the first press was relatively short lived, beside law codes and religious works, the press also produced editions of the work of Scottish [[makar]]s before its demise, probably about 1510. The next recorded press was that of [[Thomas Davidson (printer)|Thomas Davidson]] (f. 1532–42), the first in a long line of "king's printers", who also produced editions of works of the makars.&lt;ref name=MacQuarrie2001pp491-3&gt;A.

===Makars===
{{Main|Makar}}
[[James IV of Scotland|James IV]]'s (r. 1488–1513) creation of a [[Renaissance]] court included the patronage of poets. These court poets, or makars, who were mainly clerics included [[Robert Henryson]] (c. 1450-c. 1505), who re-worked Medieval and Classical sources, such as [[Chaucer]] and [[Aesop]] in works such as his ''Testament of Cresseid'' and ''The Morall Fabillis''. [[William Dunbar]] (1460–1513) produced satires, lyrics, invectives and dream visions that established the vernacular as a flexible medium for poetry of any kind. [[Gavin Douglas]] (1475–1522), who became [[Bishop of Dunkeld]], injected [[Humanism|humanist]] concerns and classical sources into his poetry.&lt;ref name=vanHeijnsbergen2001pp129-30&gt;T. van Heijnsbergen, "Culture: 9 Renaissance and Reformation: poetry to 1603", in M.

It was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language, finished in 1513, but overshadowed by the disaster at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden]] that brought the reign to an end.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp60-7"&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', pp. 60–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seal of Gavin Douglas.jpg|thumb|left|The seal of [[Gavin Douglas]] as [[Bishop of Dunkeld]]]]
As a patron of poets and authors [[James V of Scotland|James V]] (r. 1513–42) supported William Stewart and [[John Bellenden]], who translated the Latin ''History of Scotland'' compiled in 1527 by [[Hector Boece]], into verse and prose.&lt;ref name=Brownetalpp256-7/&gt; [[David Lyndsay]] (c. 1486–1555), diplomat and the head of the [[Lyon Court]], was a prolific poet.

From the 1550s, in the reign of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] (r. 1542–67) and the [[Minority reign|minority]] of her son [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] (r. 1567–1625), cultural pursuits were limited by the lack of a royal court and by political turmoil. The [[Church of Scotland|Kirk]], heavily influenced by [[Calvinism]], also discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature. Nevertheless, poets from this period included [[Richard Maitland]] of Lethington (1496–1586), who produced meditative and satirical verses in the style of Dunbar; [[John Rolland]] (fl. 1530–75), who wrote allegorical satires in the tradition of Douglas and courtier and minister [[Alexander Hume]] (c. 1556–1609), whose corpus of work includes nature poetry and [[Epistolary poem|epistolary verse]]. [[Alexander Scott (16th-century poet)|Alexander Scott]]'s (?1520–82/3) use of short verse designed to be sung to music, opened the way for the Castalian poets of James VI's adult reign.&lt;ref name=vanHeijnsbergen2001pp129-30/&gt;

Unlike many of his predecessors, James VI actively despised Gaelic culture.&lt;ref&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1580s and 1590s he strongly promoted the literature of the country of his birth in Scots. His treatise, ''[[Reulis and Cautelis|Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody]]'', published in 1584 when he was aged 18, was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue, to which he applied Renaissance principles.&lt;ref&gt;R.

Cairns, ed., ''The History of Scottish Literature'' (Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, {{ISBN|0-08-037728-9}}, pp. 126–7.&lt;/ref&gt; He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] court poets and musicians, later called the [[Castalian Band]], which included [[William Fowler (makar)|William Fowler]] (c. 1560–1612), [[John Stewart of Baldynneis]] (c. 1545–c. 1605), and [[Alexander Montgomerie]] (c. 1550–98).&lt;ref&gt;R.

Jack, ''Alexander Montgomerie'' (Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, 1985), {{ISBN|0-7073-0367-2}}, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; They translated key Renaissance texts and produced poems using French forms, including [[sonnet]]s and short sonnets, for narrative, nature description, satire and meditations on love. Later poets that followed in this vein included [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|William Alexander]] (c. 1567–1640), Alexander Craig (c. 1567–1627) and [[Robert Aytoun|Robert Ayton]] (1570–1627).&lt;ref name=vanHeijnsbergen2001pp129-30/&gt; By the late 1590s the king's championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the prospect of inheriting of the English throne.&lt;ref&gt;Jack, "Poetry under King James VI", p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyndsay produced an interlude at [[Linlithgow Palace]] for the king and queen thought to be a version of his play ''[[A Satire of the Three Estates|The Thrie Estaitis]]'' in 1540, which satirised the corruption of church and state, and which is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation.&lt;ref name=Brownetalpp256-7&gt;I.

==Seventeenth century==

===Poetry===
Having extolled the virtues of Scots "poesie", after his accession to the English throne, James VI increasingly favoured the language of southern England. In 1611 the Kirk adopted the English [[Authorised King James Version]] of the Bible. In 1617 interpreters were declared no longer necessary in the port of London because Scots and Englishmen were now "not so far different bot ane understandeth ane uther". [[Jenny Wormald]] described James as creating a "three-tier system, with Gaelic at the bottom and English at the top".&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp192-3&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', pp. 192–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the court as a centre of patronage in 1603 was a major blow to Scottish literature. A number of Scottish poets, including William Alexander, John Murray and Robert Aytoun, accompanied the king to London, where they continued to write,&lt;ref name=Brown2003pp253-4&gt;K. M. Brown, "Scottish identity", in B. Bradshaw and P.

Cairns, ed., ''The History of Scottish Literature'' (Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, {{ISBN|0-08-037728-9}}, pp. 141–52.&lt;/ref&gt; James's characteristic role as active literary participant and patron in the English court made him a defining figure for English Renaissance poetry and drama, which would reach a pinnacle of achievement in his reign,&lt;ref&gt;N.

Murphy, eds, ''Shakespeare and Scotland'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7190-6636-0}}, pp. 38–9.&lt;/ref&gt; but his patronage for the [[Stylistics (linguistics)|high style]] in his own Scottish tradition largely became sidelined.&lt;ref&gt;Jack, "Poetry under King James VI", pp. 137–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The only significant court poet to continue to work in Scotland after the king's departure was [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]] (1585–1649).&lt;ref name=vanHeijnsbergen2001pp127-8/&gt;

[[File:William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling - Project Gutenberg etext 20110.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Sir William Alexander, Earl of Stirling|William Alexander]], statesman and author]]
As the tradition of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge. While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used [[Syllabic verse|syllabic metre]], vernacular poets tended to use [[Accentual verse|stressed metre]]. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women,&lt;ref&gt;K. Chedgzoy, ''Women's Writing in the British Atlantic World'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|1-139-46714-X}}, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2001pp255-7/&gt;

The tradition of neo-Latin poetry reached its fruition with the publication of the anthology of the ''Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum'' (1637), published in Amsterdam by [[Arthur Johnston (poet)|Arthur Johnston]] (c.1579–1641) and [[Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet]] (1585–1670) and containing work by the major Scottish practitioners since Buchanan.&lt;ref name=Mason2001pp120-3/&gt; This period was marked by the work of the first named female Scottish poets.&lt;ref name=vanHeijnsbergen2001pp127-8&gt;T. van Heijnsbergen, "Culture: 7 Renaissance and Reformation (1460–1660): literature", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;127–8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Melville]]'s (f. 1585–1630) ''Ane Godlie Dream'' (1603) was a popular religious allegory and the first book published by a woman in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;I. Mortimer, ''The Time Traveller's Guide to Elizabethan England'' (Random House, 2012), {{ISBN|1-84792-114-0}}, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Hume]], daughter of David Hume of Godscroft, adapted [[Petrarch]]'s ''[[Triumphs]]'' as ''Triumphs of Love: Chastitie: Death'' (1644).&lt;ref name=vanHeijnsbergen2001pp127-8/&gt;

This was the period when the [[ballad]] emerged as a significant written form in Scotland. Some ballads may date back to the late medieval era and deal with events and people that can be traced back as far as the thirteenth century, including "[[Sir Patrick Spens]]" and "[[Thomas the Rhymer]]", but which are not known to have existed until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lyle, ''Scottish Ballads'' (Edinburgh: Canongate Books, 2001), {{ISBN|0-86241-477-6}}, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; They were probably composed and transmitted orally and only began to be written down and printed, often as [[broadside ballad|broadsides]] and as part of [[chapbooks]], later being recorded and noted in books by collectors including [[Robert Burns]] and [[Walter Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Crawford, ''Scotland's Books: a History of Scottish Literature'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-538623-X}}, pp. 216–9.&lt;/ref&gt; From the seventeenth century they were used as a literary form by aristocratic authors including [[Robert Sempill the younger|Robert Sempill]] (c. 1595-c. 1665), [[Elizabeth, Lady Wardlaw|Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw]] (1627–1727) and [[Grizel Baillie|Lady Grizel Baillie]] (1645–1746).&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, ''Scotland's Books'', pp. 224, 248 and 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===

[[File:Assembly1766.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of ''The Assembly'' by Archibald Pitcairne from the 1766 edition]]
The loss of a royal court also meant there was no force to counter the Kirk's dislike of theatre, which struggled to survive in Scotland.&lt;ref name=Brown2003pp253-4/&gt; However, it was not entirely extinguished. The Kirk used theatre for its own purposes in schools and was slow to suppress popular [[folk drama]]s.&lt;ref name=Brown2011pp1-3/&gt; Surviving plays for the period include William Alexander's ''Monarchicke Tragedies'', written just before his departure with the king for England in 1603. They were [[closet drama]]s, designed to be read rather than performed, and already indicate Alexander's preference for southern English over the Scots language.&lt;ref name=Carpenter2011p15/&gt; There were some attempts to revive Scottish drama. In 1663 Edinburgh lawyer William Clerke wrote ''Marciano or the Discovery'', a play about the restoration of a legitimate dynasty in Florence after many years of civil war. It was performed at the Tennis-Court Theatre at [[Holyrood Palace]] before the parliamentary high commissioner [[John Leslie, 1st Duke of Rothes|John Leslie, Earl of Rothes]].&lt;ref&gt;C.

===Vernacular revival===
{{Main|Allan Ramsay (poet)}}
After the [[Acts of Union 1707|Union in 1707]] and the shift of political power to England, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education.&lt;ref&gt;C. Jones, ''A Language Suppressed: The Pronunciation of the Scots Language in the 18th Century'' (Edinburgh: John Donald, 1976, 1993), {{ISBN|0-85976-427-3}}, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Scots remained the vernacular of many rural communities and the growing number of urban working-class Scots.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, McClure and Stuart-Smith, "A Brief History of Scots", p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation. [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] (1686–1758) was considered the most important literary figure of the era, often described as leading a "vernacular revival". He laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, publishing ''The Ever Green'' (1724), a collection that included many major poetic works of the Stewart period.&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Hogg, ''The Cambridge History of the English Language'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), {{ISBN|0-521-26478-2}}, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; He led the trend for [[pastoral]] poetry, helping to develop the [[Habbie stanza]], which would be later be used by Robert Burns as a [[poetic form]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius:  Edinburgh's Moment of the Mind'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0-06-055888-1}}, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Tea-Table Miscellany'' (1724–37) contained poems old Scots folk material, his own poems in the folk style and "gentilizings" of Scots poems in the English neo-classical style.&lt;ref&gt;D.

===Verse and prose===
Ramsay was part of a community of poets working in Scots and English. These included [[William Hamilton (comic poet)|William Hamilton of Gilbertfield]] (c. 1665–1751), Robert Crawford (1695–1733), [[Alexander Ross (poet)|Alexander Ross]] (1699–1784), the Jacobite [[William Hamilton (Jacobite poet)|William Hamilton]] of Bangour (1704–54), socialite [[Alison Rutherford|Alison Rutherford Cockburn]] (1712–94), and poet and playwright [[James Thompson (poet)|James Thompson]]'s (1700–48), most famous for the nature poetry of his ''Seasons''.&lt;ref&gt;C. Maclachlan, ''Before Burns'' (Canongate Books, 2010), {{ISBN|1-84767-466-6}}, pp. ix–xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tobias Smollett]] (1721–71) was a poet, essayist, satirist and playwright, but is best known for his [[picaresque novel]]s, such as ''[[The Adventures of Roderick Random]]'' (1748) and ''[[The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle]]'' (1751) for which he is often seen as Scotland's first novelist.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Beasley, ''Tobias Smollett: Novelist'' (University of Georgia Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0-8203-1971-6}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His work would be a major influence on later novelists such as [[Thackeray]] and [[Dickens]].&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, ''Scotland's Books'', p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allan-Ramsay.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Alan Ramsay]], the most influential literary figure in early eighteenth-century Scotland]]
The early eighteenth century was also a period of innovation in Gaelic vernacular poetry. Major figures included [[Rob Donn|Rob Donn Mackay]] (1714–78) and [[Donnchadh Bàn Mac an t-Saoir]] (Duncan Ban MacIntyre) (1724–1812). The most significant figure in the tradition was [[Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair]] (Alasdair MacDonald) (c. 1698–1770). His interest in traditional forms can be seen in his most significant poem ''Clanranald's Gallery''. He also mixed these traditions with influences from the Lowlands, including Thompson's ''Seasons'', which helped inspire a new form of nature poetry in Gaelic, which was not focused on their relations to human concerns.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2001pp255-7/&gt;

===Drama===
{{Main|Theatre of Scotland}}
Drama was pursued by Scottish playwrights in London such as [[Catherine Trotter]] (1679–1749), born in London to Scottish parents and later moving to Aberdeen. Her plays and included the verse-tragedy ''Fatal Friendship'' (1698), the comedy ''Love at a Loss'' (1700) and the history ''The Revolution in Sweden'' (1706). David Crawford's (1665–1726) plays included the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration comedies]] ''Courtship A-la-Mode'' (1700) and ''Love at First Sight'' (1704). These developed the character of the stage Scot, often a clown, but cunning and loyal. [[Newburgh Hamilton]] (1691–1761), born in Ireland of Scottish descent, produced the comedies ''The Petticoat-Ploter'' (1712) and ''The Doating Lovers'' or ''The Libertine'' (1715). He later wrote the libretto for Handel's ''[[Samson (Handel)|Samson]]'' (1743), closely based on [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Samson Agonistes]]''. James Thompson's plays often dealt with the contest between public duty and private feelings, included ''Sophonisba'' (1730), ''Agamemnon'' (1738) and ''Tancrid and Sigismuda'' (1745), the last of which was an international success. [[David Mallet (writer)|David Mallet]]'s (c. 1705–65) ''[[Eurydice]]'' (1731) was accused of being a coded Jacobite play and his later work indicates opposition to the [[Robert Walpole|Walpole]] administration. The opera ''[[Masque of Alfred]]'' (1740) was a collaboration between Thompson, Mallet and composer [[Thomas Arne]], with Thompson supplying the lyrics for his most famous work, the patriotic song ''[[Rule, Britannia!]]''&lt;ref name=Brown2011bpp30-31&gt;I. Brown, "Public and private performance: 1650–1800", in I. Brown, ed., ''The Edinburgh Companion to Scottish Drama'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0-7486-4107-6}}, pp. 30–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland a troop of English players came to Edinburgh in 1715 where they performed ''Macbeth'' and a series of Restoration comedies, but they soon left, perhaps because of objections from local kirk presbyteries. By 1725 English actor [[Anthony Aston]], a friend of Ramsay, was performing in Edinburgh, but seems to have fallen foul of the Scottish [[Master of the Revels]], who licensed plays, companies and playhouses, and soon left. In 1727 the Kirk attacked theatres as immoral in the ''Admonition and Exhortation''. The Edinburgh Company of Players were able to perform in Dundee, Montrose, Aberdeen and regular performances at the Taylor's Hall in Edinburgh under the protection of a Royal Patent.&lt;ref name=Brown2011bpp28-9/&gt; Ramsay was instrumental in establishing them in a small theatre in Carruber's Close in Edinburgh,&lt;ref name=Garlick2004pp170-1&gt;G.

'''''Literaturwurst''''' (''Literature Sausage'') is an [[Artist's book]],&lt;ref&gt;Considered a book by Roth, and included in lists Roth made cataloguing his work, as quoted in Dieter Roth Books + Multiples, Dobke, Hansjörg Mayer, 2004 p154&lt;/ref&gt;  made by the Swiss-German artist [[Dieter Roth]] between 1961 and 1974. Each book was made using traditional [[sausage]] recipes, but replacing the sausage meat with a book or magazine. The cover of the edition was then pasted onto the skin of the sausage and signed and dated.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'When I was young I wanted to become a real artist. Then I started doing something I felt wasn't real art, and it was through this that I became a well-known artist.' Dieter Roth&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E4DB123AF933A25755C0A96E958260 Dieter Roth, Quoted in the New York Times Obituary], 10-06-1998&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Processing text==
Roth made the first Literature Sausage from a copy of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', whilst living in [[Iceland]],&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Rot, Books and Graphics, Arts Council of Great Britain, 1973, p9&lt;/ref&gt; and gave it to his friend and colleague [[Daniel Spoerri]] in 1961. This makes it contemporaneous with his book ''Daily Mirror'' that Roth constructed this year, and was part of a series of books that used found printed matter, such as comics and off-set run up sheets, and rebound them to disrupt their visual authority.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“From time to time I take books I can’t stand or from authors I want to annoy and make: sausages c. 40 cm long, 8 cm thick, should end up as an edition of 50, titled on the outside, signed, numbered, DM100.”&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Roth to Hanns Sohm, spring 1964, quoted in Dieter Roth Books + Multiples, Dobke, Hansjörg Mayer, 2004, p9&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1963, after realizing the sausage had “ironic value”&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Wien 2002, p48, quoted in Dieter Roth Books + Multiples, Dobke, Hansjörg Mayer, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; he offered the book to [[George Maciunas]] to be published as a [[Fluxus]] Edition via mutual friend Arthur Kopke. Maciunas turned down the idea, although Roth still participated in a number of early Fluxus events. He returned to the idea in 1966, producing 24 over the next few years, using books such as ''Tin Drum'' by [[Günter Grass]], ''[[To Seek a Newer World]]'' by [[Robert Kennedy]] and ''The Redhead'' by [[Alfred Andersch]]. Uniquely, ''Halbzeit'' (Half-time by [[Martin Walser]]), was cut into unequal halves and hung in a deeply recessed picture frame.

===Expansion of the series===
In 1970 the series was expanded to include magazines; ''[[Quick (German magazine)|Quick]],'' ''[[Bunte]]'', ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' and ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]''. These last 25 were manufactured by Editions Rene Block, Berlin, and stuffed into plastic skins rather than intestine.
[[Image:Literatur wurst2.jpg|thumb|260px|left|''Literaturwurst'' recipes, published in ''Gesammelte Werke'' vol 16]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If you follow these instructions carefully i shall give you these two sausages to sell and soil and slice and save and save and do whatever else you wish without restriction! so; (don't be or get angry now) get a recipe from a butcher a recipe for sausages and follow this recipe (exactly), so that everything in the recipe that is not MEAT, in the doug or the mass (whatever that's called) included- spices, water, gelatine, onions, garlic etc etc; PUT IT ALL IN, and then in place of meat use the pages of the book!"&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Hanns Sohm, 1964, quoted in Dieter Roth Books + Multiples, Dobke, Hansjörg Mayer, 2004, p9&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Foodstuffs as art===
The book was to become the first of a large series of pieces by Roth that used foodstuffs, occasionally preserved, more usually rotting, such as ''Porträt Carl Laszlo'' 1963, in which a portrait of a collector is covered in cheese and chocolate, and ''P.O.TH.A.A.VFB'', a [[self-portrait]] multiple made of [[chocolate]] and [[birdseed]], at least one of which was left out on a bird-table, to be eaten by birds.

The most notorious was the ''Staple Cheese (A Chase)'' exhibition at the Eugenia Butler Gallery, [[Los Angeles]], 1970. This consisted of a series of suitcases filled with cheese, as well as wall mounted cheese intended to drip over a horizontal line below. A different case was opened each day to reveal different states of decay. In less than three weeks, the gallery was 'practically impossible to enter'&lt;ref&gt;Roth Time A Dieter Roth Retrospective, Dobke, Lars Muller, 2004, p130&lt;/ref&gt; with prospective viewers having to contend with flies, larvae and maggots as well as the smell. The suitcases remained unsold, and were finally thrown away in the desert by the dealer's husband.

=== Culmination of the Series: Hegel's Collected Works ===
The series culminated in 1974 with ''[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]’s Werke in 20 Bänden'' (''Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s Work in 20 Volumes''), made by the collector [[Hanns Sohm]] according to Roth’s instructions. The 20 sausages are hung on two rows on a wooden frame, ‘as in a slaughterhouse.’&lt;ref&gt;Roth Time, Dobke &amp; Walter, Lars Müller, 2004, p74&lt;/ref&gt;

Roth would also publish some of the sausage’s recipes, listing the ingredients used, in ''Gesammelte Werke'', (Collected Works) Vol 16.

[[File:Madonna della strada.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The original painting of ''Madonna Della Strada'', hanging in the [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome]]

'''''Madonna Della Strada''''' or '''''Santa Maria Della Strada''''' &amp;mdash; the [[Italian language|Italian]] for '''''Our Lady of the Wayside''''', or '''''Our Lady of the Good Road''''' &amp;mdash; is the name of an image of the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]], enshrined at the [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome, [[mother church]] of the [[Society of Jesus]] [[religious order]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and is a variation on the Eastern ''basilissa'' (imperial) type of icon.&lt;ref name=Waldrop/&gt;

The ''Madonna Della Strada'' is the [[patron saint|patroness]] of the Society of Jesus. Its founder, [[Ignatius of Loyola]], was said to have been protected by the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary during battle in his service as a  soldier.&lt;ref&gt; John W. O'Malley, et all 1999 ''The Jesuits'' University of Toronto Press {{ISBN|978-0-8020-4287-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The name goes back to a shrine established in Rome in the 5th century by the Astalli family, originally known as the ''Madonna degli Astalli'', at a crossroads along the ceremonial route of the popes.&lt;ref name=Waldrop&gt;[http://americamagazine.org/issue/720/art/object-devotion Waldrop S.J., Gregory. "Object of Devotion", ''America'', December 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 13th-14th century fresco (a wall painting done on damp plaster) was originally painted on the wall of Saint Mary of the Way in Rome, the church of  the  Society of Jesus (Jesuits), given to Saint Ignatius by Pope Paul III in 1540.&lt;ref name=Pauca&gt;[http://paucaverba.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-madonna-della-strada.html Morris, Stephen P., "The Madonna della Strada", ''Pauca Verba'', May 12, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1568, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese erected the [[Church of the Gesù|Gesù Church of Rome]], the mother church of the Jesuits, in place of the former church of Santa Maria della Strada. The fresco was moved there in 1575 to a side chapel where Jesuits pronounced their vows. Sometime in the 19th century, the image was transferred to canvas and affixed to a slate panel.&lt;ref name=Waldrop/&gt;

[[File:Il Gesù 002.JPG|thumb|220px|Altar of ''Madonna Della Strada'']]
The icon is  located between two altars, the first dedicated to [[Ignatius of Loyola]], the second, the main altar of the Church, dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Louis A. Bonacci, "[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/s/santa-maria-della-strada.php Santa Maria della Strada]," ''All About Mary''. International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton&lt;/ref&gt;

The icon was restored in 2006, revealing at least two layers of previous paint, the original art being a fresco which had been detached from a wall and affixed to canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contemplatioadamorem.blogspot.com/2006/12/restored-image-of-madonna-della-strada.html "Restored image of the Madonna della Strada", Contemplatio ad amorem, December 04, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Jesuits celebrate the feast of Our Lady of the Way on May 24. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjweb.info/resources/Calender_Liturgy/2012-18_Proper%20Calendar%20SI_ENG.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

There is a chapel dedicated to ''[[Madonna Della Strada Chapel|Madonna Della Strada]]'' at Loyola University in Chicago, Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luc.edu/mdsweddings/ "Madonna Della Strada weddings", Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Scranton]] in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scranton.edu/about/community-relations/religious-services.shtml "Campus Religious Services", University of Scranton, Scranton, Pennsylvania]&lt;/ref&gt; and at Zilber Hall, [[Marquette University]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marquette.edu/magazine/recent.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1349125200 Bazan, Jessie. "Zilber Hall’s inspiring sacred space", ''Marquette Magazine'', Summer 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

A copy of the image hangs in the [[Le Moyne College|Le Moyne College Chapel]].&lt;ref name=Creighton&gt; [http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/andre/strada_o.html "Jesuit History in Art: Madonna Della Strada", Creighton University]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film stars [[Bella Thorne]], [[Patrick Schwarzenegger]], and [[Rob Riggle]], and follows a teenage girl with the disease [[xeroderma pigmentosum]], which prevents her from going out into sunlight.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for films should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
Sheltered since early childhood, Katie Price lives with a life-threatening sensitivity to sunlight caused by the rare genetic condition, [[xeroderma pigmentosum]]. During the day, she is housebound, having only her father, Jack and her best friend, Morgan, to keep her company. Katie comes out of the house every night, when the sun is not present.

One night, she is noticed and asked out by her longtime crush, Charlie, while playing guitar at the train station. Katie leaves suddenly, and forgets her notebook, which Charlie keeps. He returns the next day, and gives it to Katie when she shows up to retrieve it. He explains to her how he got his injury that prevented him from getting a scholarship to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] before kissing her on one of the boats.

However, Katie has yet to tell Charlie of her condition, despite her father warning her to. Charlie takes Katie out for a night to [[Seattle]], where they go to a live show, and Charlie makes Katie play one of her songs on one of the city's streets. Once home, they go swimming out in the lake, and dry off with a fire on the beach. Charlie mentions watching the sunrise, and Katie freaks out, running home in fear. Charlie picks her up and quickly drives her there, but she does not make it in time, and is exposed to the sunlight for a couple of seconds. Katie runs inside, while Morgan and Jack come home soon after. Charlie still is standing confused at the front door, and Morgan explains that Katie has xeroderma pigmentosum. Once the doctors run some tests, Katie's doctor comes to the conclusion that Katie's brain is contracting, and it's only a matter of time before she dies.

Katie begins to experience twitches in her finger, which prevents her from playing the guitar. She also ignores Charlie's  messages as she does not want to hurt him. Jack eventually convinces Katie to speak to Charlie, who still wants to be with Katie, and does not care about the medical condition. Katie goes to Charlie's swim meet with the Berkeley coach, and they hang out at the house with Morgan and Jack. Charlie takes Katie out one night, and surprises her by booking a recording session, where she sings a song she wrote for him. Soon after, while hanging out at her house, Charlie mentions that he has to visit the boat for the last time, which he has been hired to take care of the whole summer. Katie, fearing that she is going to die, eventually remembers the time Charlie told her that he wished they could sail together, and convinces Jack to let her go with Charlie, despite it being the day. Katie sails with Charlie, feels the sunlight, and spend her final moments with him, dying soon after.

[[File:Bonsai aus Geschenkschnürchen makffm.jpg|thumb|Model of a bonsai tree, an engagement present made from Mizuhiki]]
'''Mizuhiki''' (水引) is an ancient [[Japan]]ese art form that uses a special cord. 

The cord is created from rice paper, that is tightly wound, starched to give it stiffness, and then colored. The ways of coloring include brightly colored [[BoPET|Mylar]] (a very thin plastic), thin strands of silk, or simply painted. The art form was used to tie up the hair of the [[samurai]].

Currently there are several forms. The traditional decoration, given away at Japanese occasions, such as [[wedding]]s, [[birth]]s, and [[funeral]]s take the forms of [[animal]]s or [[boat]]s. Different animals are created for different meanings, including [[crane (bird)|crane]]s, [[frog]]s, [[fish]], [[dragon]]s, and [[turtle]]s are among the most popular. The other traditional way the art is done is in decorating cards with little colored knots, similarly to how people in western cultures use a [[ribbon]] and [[Ribbon|bow]]. A third way is being developed that uses the ancient art for a more modern purpose, [[jewelry]].

'''''The Nagauta Symphony''''' is a [[symphony]] in one [[Movement (music)|movement]] composed in [[1934 in music|1934]] by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] composer [[Kosaku Yamada]].

==Description==
Kosaku Yamada was the first major Japanese composer to study the [[Classical music|European tradition]], and the first to write in the symphonic and operatic forms.&lt;ref name="Katayama"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naxos.com/composerinfo/Koscak_Yamada/20862.htm|title="Yamada, Koscak  Biography"|accessdate=2008-05-16|first=Morihide|last=Katayama|publisher=[[Naxos Records]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was responsible for introducing Japanese audiences to much of the European orchestral tradition through his conducting.&lt;ref name="UCLA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=91938|title=European Classical Meets Japanese Nagauta|accessdate=2008-05-16|date=2008-05-08|last=Lim|first=Vincent|publisher=UCLA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601200355/http://www.international.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=91938|archivedate=2008-06-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his compositions, Yamada had been working to combine European traditions with [[Music of Japan|Japanese classical music]] since at least 1921, when he composed ''Inno Meiji'' which combined Japanese and western instruments.&lt;ref name="Katayama"/&gt; Composed in 1934, the ''Nagauta Symphony'' represented the culmination of this work.&lt;ref name="arkivmusic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=171843&amp;album_group=5|title=Yamada: Nagauta Symphony, Etc / Miyata, Ajimi, Yuasa, et al. |accessdate=2008-05-16|date=2008-05-08|last=Lange|first=Art|publisher=ArkivMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For this work, Yamada composed music for the western orchestra which is used to counterpoint a classical ''[[nagauta]]'', the music which accompanies the ''[[kabuki]]''.&lt;ref name="recordsinternational"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recordsinternational.com/cd.php?cd=09J003|title=KÓSÇAK YAMADA (1886-1965): Nagauta Symphony “Tsurukame”, Sinfonia “Inno Meiji”, Choreographic Symphony “Maria Magdalena”.|accessdate=2008-05-16|publisher=Records International}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony is subtitled ''Tsurukame'' after the name of the ''[[nagauta]]'' which is used.&lt;ref name="arkivmusic"/&gt; Composed in 1857,&lt;ref name="recordsinternational"/&gt; the text celebrates the [[Emperor of Japan]] and the imperial court.&lt;ref name="arkivmusic"/&gt; The symphony is in one movement with a duration of approximately 17 minutes.&lt;ref name="arkivmusic"/&gt;

==Instrumentation==
The ''Nagauta Symphony'' uses a [[Orchestra|western orchestra]] and voices, as well as an ensemble of [[traditional Japanese musical instruments]].&lt;ref name="recordsinternational"/&gt; The Japanese ensemble consists of several [[shamisen]] and percussion.&lt;ref name="arkivmusic"/&gt;

[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans, The Nativity at Night, c 1490.jpg|thumb|300px|The ''Nativity at Night'', [[National Gallery, London]] by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]].]]
&lt;!-- NO infobox please! --&gt;
The '''''Nativity at Night''''' or '''''Night Nativity''''' is an [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of about 1490 by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]] in the [[National Gallery, London]] (NG 4081).&lt;ref name="NatGal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/geertgen-tot-sint-jans-the-nativity-at-night |work=National Gallery |accessdate=22 October 2018 |title=The Nativity at Night}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a [[panel painting]] in [[oil painting|oil]] on [[oak]], measuring 34 × 25.3&amp;nbsp;cm.,&lt;ref name="NatGal"/&gt; though it has been cut down in size on all four sides.  The painting shows the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]], attended by angels, and with the [[Annunciation to the shepherds]] on the hillside behind seen through the window in the centre of the painting.&lt;ref name="NatGal"/&gt; It is a small painting presumably made for private devotional use, and Geertgen's version, with significant changes, of a lost work by [[Hugo van der Goes]] of about 1470.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 232 &amp; 238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
Like many paintings of the ''Nativity'', the depiction is influenced by the visions of [[Saint Bridget of Sweden]] (1303–1373), a very popular mystic.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 232; Schiller, 78–81 on Bridget's influence and 84 on this work.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly before her death, she described a vision of the infant Jesus as lying on the ground, and emitting light himself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the virgin knelt down with great veneration in an attitude of prayer, and her back was turned to the manger&amp;nbsp;... And while she was standing thus in prayer, I saw the child in her womb move and suddenly in a moment she gave birth to her son, from whom radiated such an ineffable light and splendour, that the sun was not comparable to it, nor did the candle that St. Joseph had put there, give any light at all, the divine light totally annihilating the material light of the candle&amp;nbsp;... I saw the glorious infant lying on the ground naked and shining. His body was pure from any kind of soil and impurity. Then I heard also the singing of the angels, which was of miraculous sweetness and great beauty&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Schiller,78, including quotation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
[[File:Michel Sittow 003.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael Sittow]]'s version of Hugo van der Goes' original, c. 1510–20, keeping the original orientation.]]

Many depictions reduced other light sources in the scene to emphasize this effect, and the Nativity remained very commonly treated with [[chiaroscuro]] through to the [[Baroque]]. Here the sources of light are the infant Jesus himself, in accordance with Bridget's vision, who is the sole source of illumination for the main scene inside the stable, the shepherds' fire on the hill behind, and the angel who appears to them.  In fact this effect now goes beyond what was intended by the artist, as the painting was damaged in a fire in 1904, when it was in a private collection in [[Berlin]]. The different shades of blue given the upper and lower parts of the Virgin's clothing and the sky outside now appear as murky dark browns or blacks, and the painting is generally darker.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 232&lt;/ref&gt; The painting had been cut down by 1901.  There is a copy of the painting in the Diocesan Museum in [[Barcelona]], which suggests that the original size was about 45 × 31&amp;nbsp;cm.  In this the rays emanating from the Christ-Child are more evident, and the animals behind less so.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 236&lt;/ref&gt;

The Geertgen painting reverses (makes a mirror-image of) the main figures of the earlier work presumed to have been by van der Goes, which is now lost but known from several versions. Only the main figures are reversed, and not the background of the building and the shepherds' scene outside.
[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans Nativity Detail1.jpg|333px|thumb|Detail, Geertgen]]
Apart from the reversal, there were other differences: in the van der Goes four angels knelt round the manger, and a larger group hovered near the top of the picture-space; the window had a sill higher than the Virgin's head; and [[Saint Joseph]] held a lighted candle in his hands.  The composition showed a view generally pulled back, without the intimate close-up effect of Geertgen's version, which has the figures pushed closely together.  The closest to the original is thought to be a version in the church in [[Annaberg-Buchholz|Annaberg]] in [[Saxony]] (illustrated in Campbell), which the version by [[Michael Sittow]] in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]] (illustrated) resembles closely, apart from the shaping of the top edge.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 237–8. The Vienna painting was formerly attributed to [[Gerard David]] (see Châtelet, 221 for example)&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the architectural details vary, both the Annaberg and Sittow paintings show rather grander buildings, in a better state of repair, than Geertgen, whose building has a sloping timber roof.  In Early Netherlandish painting the usual simple shed of the Nativity, little changed from Late Antiquity, often developed into an elaborate ruined temple, initially [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] in style, which represented the dilapidated state of the [[Covenant (biblical)|Old Covenant]] of the [[Jewish law]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 49–50. For further details see [[Nativity of Jesus in art#Western image]]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Composition=== 
[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans Nativity Detail4.jpg|left|388px|thumb|Detail, Geertgen]]
Geertgen has simplified van der Goes' composition to a "bold design based on grid-like patterns", which the effects of the fire on the colour values has further simplified.  The van der Goes original "was a more complex, more ambitious and more solemn, but perhaps a less touching, picture."&lt;ref name="c238"&gt;Campbell, 238&lt;/ref&gt;  The Geertgen is a famous painting, that has received much critical attention, not all of which has taken into account the earlier van der Goes work and the effects of the fire and cutting-down.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 238, Snyder 178&lt;/ref&gt;  The statement by [[Erwin Panofsky]] that the Geertgen was "the earliest nocturne in the optically strict sense of the word" is described in the National Gallery catalogue as a "rash claim".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 238 (both quotes). Panofsky's claim was from p.325 of his ''Early Netherlandish Painting'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;  Quite apart from the van der Goes, night scenes had essentially been developed in [[illuminated manuscript]]s before moving to panel paintings, and the realistic [[night vision]] effect of very muted colour values and "simplification of volumes" owes as much to the later fire as the artist's intention.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 238; Châtelet, 114 (quotation)&lt;/ref&gt; James Snyder, perhaps unaware the painting had been cut down, compares the "fractional figures" on the sides of the painting to those in Geertgen's ''[[Man of Sorrows (Geertgen tot Sint Jans)|Man of Sorrows]]'', and says they "bring the viewer into the picture, allowing him to look over their shoulders".&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 178&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Barcelona version the figure of the extreme left-hand  angel is still cut off by the frame.

Geertgen worked in [[Haarlem]], and was the leading Netherlandish painter of his day who both came from and worked in the Northern Netherlands (approximately the modern [[Netherlands]]), rather than [[Flanders]] (mostly now in [[Belgium]]).  Various attempts have been made to relate his style, in this and other works, to much later [[Dutch art|Dutch painting]], for example by [[Max Jakob Friedländer]],&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, 53–55&lt;/ref&gt; but "nationalistic allegations that Geertgen was quintessentially 'Dutch'" are rejected by Lorne Campbell.&lt;ref name="c238" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23421">'''Open educational practices''' (OEP) is the use of Open educational Resources for teaching and learning in order to innovate the learning process (Ehlers 2010). They are represented in teaching techniques that draw upon open technologies and high-quality [[Open Educational Resources|open educational resources]] (OER) in order to facilitate collaborative and flexible learning.&lt;ref name="JISCOEPbrief" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benzato" /&gt; They may involve students participating in online, [[peer production]] communities &lt;ref name="COLTdef" /&gt; within activities intended to support learning &lt;ref name="OPALdef" /&gt; or more broadly, any context where access to educational opportunity through freely available online content and services is the norm.&lt;ref name="JISCOEPbrief" /&gt; Such activities may include (but are not limited to &lt;ref name="JISCOEPbrief" /&gt;), the creation, use and repurposing of [[Open Educational Resources|open educational resources]] and their adaptation to the contextual setting.&lt;ref name=OPALdef /&gt;&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ICDEdef" /&gt; OEP can also include the open sharing of teaching practices&lt;ref name="JISCOEPbrief" /&gt; and aim "to raise the quality of education and training and innovate educational practices on an institutional, professional and individual level".&lt;ref name="OPALmission" /&gt; The OEP community includes policy makers, managers/ administrators of organisations, educational professionals and learners.&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt; OEP are also viewed as the next phase in OER development that continues to transform 21st century learning and learners.&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt;

==The Scope of Open Educational Practices==
A database or repository of [[open educational resources]] is not open educational practice (Ehlers 2011). OER have a lifecycle of creation, use, and management. Open educational practices aim to take the focus beyond building further access to OER and consider how in practice, such resources support education and promote quality and innovation in teaching and learning. They focus on reproduction/understanding, connecting information, application, competence and responsibility rather than the availability of good resources.&lt;ref name="ElConUnleash" /&gt;

===Definitions===
There is no canonical definition of open educational practice, however various groups and scholars have given their definition or view. One such scholar is Ehlers (2011) who defines OEP "as practices which support the (re)use and production of OER through institutional policies, promote innovative pedagogical models, and respect and empower learners as co-producers on their lifelong learning path".&lt;ref name="EhOEROEP" /&gt; A definition used by others either in its entirety&lt;ref name="ICDEdef" /&gt; or as basis for further development.&lt;ref name="JISCOEPbrief" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ICDEdef" /&gt;
* The ''[[Open Educational Quality (OPAL) Initiative]]'' define Open Educational Practices as "the use of [[Open Educational Resources]] to raise the quality of education and training and innovate educational practices on institutional, professional and individual level".&lt;ref name="OPALmission" /&gt;
* The [[International Council for Open and Distance Education]] (ICDE): "Open Educational Practices are defined as practices which support the production, use and reuse of high quality open educational resources (OER) through institutional policies, which promote innovative pedagogical models, and respect and empower learners as co-producers on their lifelong learning path".&lt;ref name="ICDEdef" /&gt;
* The UK OER support and evaluation team suggest that (compared to ICDE) "a broader definition would encompass all activities that open up access to educational opportunity, in a context where freely available online content and services (whether 'open', 'educational' or not) are taken as the norm".&lt;ref name="JISCOEPbrief" /&gt;
* The [[Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education]] (ISKME) defines Open Educational Practices (OEP) as comprising a set of skills in collaboration, curation, curricular design, and leadership around the use of [[Open Educational Resources]]. OEP build educator capacity for using OER to improve curriculum, instruction, and pedagogy, and to gain skills in digital resource curation and curriculum creation, and to actively collaborate around and advocate for innovative approaches to open education and OER. ISKME developed the Open Educational Practice Rubric to articulate key learning objectives for integrating OER and open educational practice into teaching and learning improvement and leadership.&lt;ref name="ISKMEOEPRubric" /&gt;
* The Center for Open Learning and Teaching (University of Mississippi) state that "Open Educational Practices (OEP) are teaching techniques that introduce students to online peer production communities. Such communities (for instance, Wikipedia, YouTube, Open Street Map) host dynamic communities and offer rich learning environments".&lt;ref name="COLTdef" /&gt;
* The [[European Foundation for Quality in e-Learning]] (EFQUEL) write that Open Educational Practices are "the next phase in OER development which will see a shift from a focus on resources to a focus on open educational practices being a combination of open resources use and open learning architectures to transform learning into 21st century learning environments in which universities’, adult learners and citizens are provided with opportunities to shape their lifelong learning pathways in an autonomous and self-guided way".&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt;
* The [[Cape Town Open Education Declaration]] (with over 2,500 signatories) reads: "open education is not limited to just open educational resources. It also draws upon open technologies that facilitate collaborative, flexible learning and the open sharing of teaching practices that empower educators to benefit from the best ideas of their colleagues. It may also grow to include new approaches to assessment, accreditation and collaborative learning".&lt;ref name="CapeDec" /&gt;

===OEP Areas===
Best practice case studies identify a number of OEP areas.&lt;ref name="OPALclearhouse" /&gt;

{{div col|colwidth=22em}}

* Business Model for OEP
* Commitment
* Creation of OER

==Impact==
Adopting OEP can lead to opportunities for collaborative learning through the affordances of Web 2.0 tools. In this context, open also refers to the learning environment where learner's set their own objectives rather than being restricted by those set externally (a closed environment).&lt;ref name="ElConUnleash" /&gt;

Open educational practices can also provide the experience and tools to help bridge the gap between formal and informal learning, and potentially an open source curriculum or emergent curriculum.&lt;ref name="ElConUnleash" /&gt;

===Levels of Openness===
The trajectory to Open Education Practices lies between the use of open pedagogical models and, resource use and creation.:&lt;ref name="EhOEROEP" /&gt;
* Low - teachers believe they know what learners have to learn. A focus on knowledge transfer
* Medium - Predetermined Objectives (closed environment&lt;ref name="ElConUnleash" /&gt;) but, using open pedagogical models and encourage dialogue and [[Problem-based learning]].
* High - Learning Objectives and pathways highly governed by learners.

The [[International Council for Open and Distance Education]] sees OEP as those practices which support the production, use and reuse of high quality [[open educational resources]] and regards that OEP are often achieved through institutional policies, which promote innovative pedagogical models, and respect. Learners are empowered as co-producers on their [[lifelong learning]] path. The scope of OEP covers all areas of OER governance: policy makers, managers and administrators of organizations, educational professionals and learners.&lt;ref name="ICDEdef" /&gt;

Open e-Learning Content Observatory Services (OLCOS) project is a Transversal Action under the European eLearning Programme.&lt;ref name="Geser" /&gt;

The OLCOS Roadmap focuses on Open Educational Practices, providing orientation and recommendations to educational decision makers on how to develop the use of OER. To further benefit from OERs one needs to better understand how their role could promote innovation and change in educational practices.&lt;ref name="Geser" /&gt;

The Roadmap states that; delivering OER to the dominant model of teacher-centred knowledge transfer will have little effect in equipping teachers, students and workers with the knowledge and skills required in the knowledge economy and, lifelong learning. Downloading Web-accessible, open teaching materials for classes and, continuing a one-way channel of content provision, will likely mirror the little impact achieved with regard to changing educational practices following the massive investments in the e-learning infrastructure by educational institutions. Open Educational Practices aim to deliver a competency-focused, constructivist paradigm of learning and promote a creative and collaborative engagement with digital content, tools and services to meet knowledge and skills required today.&lt;ref name="Geser" /&gt;

===SCORE===
The Support Centre for Open Resources in Education (SCORE) at the Open University (UK), was the second major initiative to be funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce). (The first being the UKOER programme, jointly run by the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] (JISC) and the [[Higher Education Academy]] (HEA)).&lt;ref name="LaneSCORE" /&gt;

Discussions and actions were moving on from how open educational resources are published to how they are used. Placing OER as an enabler, within a wider set of open educational practices. Over a period of three years, SCORE, initiated a series of activities and events that involved several hundred educational practitioners from the majority of the higher education institutions in England.&lt;ref name="LaneSCORE" /&gt;

There has been interest in how educational practitioners would accept and embed open resources into their practices (Geser, 2007 in &lt;ref name="LaneSCORE" /&gt;). Sharing is at the heart of the philosophy OER and probably OEP and thus collective and cooperative activities between people and institutions are likely to be a key factor in the sustainability of such practices. SCORE reports it succeeded in raising the profile of OER and OEP within UK higher education institutions by assisting existing [[communities of practice]] and by creating new communities of practice to form a much larger network of practice that will be sustained by its participants.&lt;ref name="LaneSCORE" /&gt;

==Challenges==
There are many challenges to the adoption of open educational practices. Certain aspects like technology have received greater attention than others&lt;ref name="Benzato" /&gt; but all of the factors below inhibit widespread use of open educational practices:
* Technology - Lack of or insufficient investment in broadband access as well as up-to-date software&lt;ref name="Benzato" /&gt; and hardware
* Business Model - OER and OEP can incur a significant provider cost.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt; Typically financial models focus on technology, but they also need to account for staff; i.e., those who create, reuse, mix, and modify the content.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
* Law &amp; Policy - There is either ignorance on open access licenses, such as Creative Commons License and Gnu Public License,&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt; and/or restrictive intellectual property rights that limit the development of OEP.&lt;ref name="Benzato" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaffert" /&gt;
* Pedagogy - Traditional models of learning are teacher-centric&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt; where teachers dispense knowledge to students,&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt; and teachers/professors may not know how to integrate OEP into courses.&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt;
* Quality Assessment - There is not a quick and universal way to assess the quality of OER. [[MERLOT]], based on the academic peer review process, has only reviewed 14% of submitted material.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
* Cultural Imperialism - There is the concern that Western institutions use OEP to design educational courses for developing countries.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;

===Strategies &amp; Recommendations===
In order for there to be widespread adoption of OEP, legal and educational policy must change&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt; and OEP needs to become sustainable.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
* Funding - Develop a sustainable funding model for OEP that addresses technology and staffing. Various funding models being explored and examples:
:* Endowment Model, e.g. the [[Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Project]].&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Membership Model, e.g. [[Sakai Project|Sakai Educational Partners Program]] where member organizations pay a fee.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Donations Model, e.g. Wikipedia and [[Apache Foundation]]. Even though Apache has modified it so that there are fees for some services.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Conversion Model, e.g. Redhat, Ubuntu, SuSe. They convert free subscribers to paying customers for advanced features and support.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Contributor Pay Model, e.g. [[Public Library of Science]] (PLoS) where contributors pay for the cost of maintaining the contribution.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Sponsorship Model, e.g. MIT iCampus Outreach Initiative, which is sponsored by Microsoft &amp; China Open Resources for Education, and Stanford on iTunes, which is sponsored by Stanford &amp; Apple. They are free for users with commercial messages by sponsors.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Institutional Model, e.g. [[MIT OpenCourseWare|MIT OpenCourseWare Project]].&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Government Model including UN programmes, e.g. [[SchoolNet|Canada's SchoolNet Project]].&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
:* Partnership and Exchange, e.g. Universities working together to create OER systems.&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;
* Law &amp; Policy - In terms of law, there should be an open access mandate for partially or fully publicly funded research.&lt;ref name="Camilleri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schaffert" /&gt; Also teachers and researchers should be better informed about their intellectual property rights. Researchers and teachers who use public funding should sign non-exclusive copyrights so their institutions make their work available under appropriate licenses.&lt;ref name="Schaffert" /&gt;
* Open advocates should demand public-private partnerships
* Build stakeholders -
* Quality Assessment -
* Pedagogy - Help teachers change to facilitate use of OEP to emphasize learners' developing competences, knowledge, and skills. Therefore, teaching is no longer educator-centric, but instead it focuses on what learners can do for themselves.&lt;ref name="Schaffert" /&gt;

'''Parametric Thinking''' is the influence of engaging in a [[thinking process]] that links, relates and outputs calculated actions to generate solutions to problems, rather than simply seeking them.&lt;ref&gt;http://fmj.ifma.org/article/Case+Study%3A+An+Integrated+Approach+to+Workplace+Design+and+Delivery/2371947/287706/article.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has its origins in the design fields of; [[urban design]], [[architectural design]], [[interior design]], [[Industrial design|industrial]] and [[furniture design]].  The process is associated with [[Parametricism]] a style within contemporary avant-garde architecture, promoted as a successor to post-modern architecture and modern architecture.

==History==
Parametric thinking emerged as a theory-driven design education, project and delivery movement in the early 2010s, with its earliest practitioners harnessing and adapting the then new [[parametric design]] software and other advanced computational processes that had been introduced within architecture and related design fields.  In the architecture education context in 2011 professors of the schools of architecture David Karle and Brian Kelly of [[University of Nebraska]] published advocacy for a paradigm shift in design education.  

Karle and Kelly also highligthed that "digital tools are currently being used in design schools across the country.  This paradigm in both education and practice of architecture is continually changing the profession, from the way in which design is conceived, represented, documented, and fabricated.  [[Parametric design]] can be defined as series of questions to establish the variables of a design and a computational definition that can be utilized to facilitate a variety of solutions.  Parametric thinking is a way of relating tangible and intangible systems into a design proposal removed from digital tool specificity and establishes relationships between properties within a system.  It asks architects to start with the design parameters and not preconceived or predetermined design solutions.".&lt;ref&gt;http://cumincad.architexturez.net/doc/oai-cumincadworks.id-acadiaregional2011_012{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parametric thinking in the design process context of best practice as defined by designer/technologist Chris Swartout of [http://mmoser.com M Moser Associates] is "a [[pedagogic]] approach that combines design and generative solution delivery through reliance on a multidisciplinary team’s knowledge expertise at the outset of the project. This leads to increased productivity, achieving the desired outcome that balances all the interests of design, schedule, cost, aesthetics and functionality, while not predetermining a solution. This approach enhances design output and reduces abortive work."  &lt;ref&gt;http://fmj.ifma.org/article/Case+Study%3A+An+Integrated+Approach+to+Workplace+Design+and+Delivery/2371947/287706/article.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Farshid Moussavi]] professor in practice at [[Harvard University Graduate School of Design]] has argued that parametric thinking at some level has always existed in architecture as a discipline because "great architecture has been aware of its societal role, and has consequently been informed by [[multivalent]] parameters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elcontexto.net/post/15032978670/farshid-moussavi-on-the-need-for-parametric&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.architectural-review.com/viewpoints-farshid-moussavi-on-the-need-for-parametric-thinking/8620000.article/

==Namesake==
Robert Grant or R.G. Smith contributed immeasurably to the preservation of the heritage and history of U.S. naval aviation through his 50-plus year career as an aeronautical engineer and as an accomplished artist.  The R.G. Smith Award for “excellence in naval aviation art” is bestowed by the [[National Museum of Naval Aviation]] in his honor.

R.G. Smith graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from the Polytechnic College of Engineering in Oakland in 1934.  He was hired in 1936 as an engineer by [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] Aircraft, then a subsidiary of [[Douglas Aircraft]], where he helped design naval aircraft such as the [[SBD Dauntless]], [[AD Skyraider]], [[F4D Skyray]], [[A-3 Skywarrior]], and the [[A-4 Skyhawk]].  

Later, he became the Douglas Company's full-time artist, spent time as a combat artist in [[Vietnam]], and was one of the five original founders of the American Society of Aviation Artists.  More than a million of his lithographs of commercial and military aircraft have been printed.

R.G. Smith died at his home in [[Rancho Mirage, California]] on May 29, 2001 at the age of 87.

A selection of over 120 of his paintings and drawings, as well as a complete biography can be found in "R.G. Smith - The Man and his Art: An Autobiography".  Hardcover: 112 pages, Schiffer Publishing (February 1999), {{ISBN|0-7643-0755-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7643-0755-3}}.

R.G. Smith was designated Honorary [[Naval aviator|Naval Aviator]] Number 11 on May 8, 1973 by VADM William D. Houser, Deputey [[Chief of Naval Operations]] for Air Warfare.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/avh-1910/APP18.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Saint Barbara Altarpiece''' is a medieval [[altarpiece]] attributed to [[Master Francke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Renaissance art: a topical dictionary |author=Irene Earls |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-313-24658-6 |page=35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIc7eqi2SzUC&amp;pg=PA35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its known [[provenance]] starts at the medieval church in [[Kalanti]] in [[Southwest Finland]] where it stood until 1883. According to local [[oral tradition]] that was collected in the 19th century, the altarpiece was found floating in the sea outside Kalanti. The altarpiece is now located at the [[National Museum of Finland]].

The altarpiece is best known for the paintings depicting the legend of [[Saint Barbara]] on the outside of its inner wings.

'''''St Sebastian''''' is a painting of c. 1614 by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], showing the Christian [[Saint Sebastian]]. It dates to the early years of Rubens' stay in Rome - its sinuous line and defined figures are thought to be the result of his studies of [[Michelangelo]] and of Flemish [[Mannerism]]. It was bought by the [[Borghese]] directly from cardinal [[Neri Corsini (1614–1678)|Neri Corsini]] in [[Brussels]]. It is now in the [[Borghese collection]].

In 1618, Rubens wrote the English Sir Dudley Carlton a letter describing a collection of his own paintings he had at his home he wished to trade, including a painting of a naked St. Sebastian. It is more than likely not that this is that painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marx|first1=Daniel|last2=Krén|first2=Emil|title=St. Sebastian by RUBENS, Peter Paul|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/r/rubens/10religi/13religi.html|website=Web Gallery of Art|publisher=Web Gallery of Art|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The David Alsop Sustainability Award, in memory of David Alsop, who died on 18 October 1996 while a vice president and president elect of the Institution of Structural Engineers, is made for "an outstanding structure which demonstrates excellent coordination of all aspects of the
engineering elements and services combined with elegance, life-time economy and respect for the environment in which the structure is built."&lt;ref&gt;''The Structural Engineer'', Volume 78 No 4 15 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; It was first awarded in 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34724">[[File:Versailles chateau.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Palace of Versailles]] (1661–1710)]]
The '''Style Louis XIV''', also called French classicism, was the style of architecture and decorative arts intended to glorify [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] and his reign. It featured majesty, harmony and regularity.  It became the official style during the reign of Louis XIV (1643–1715), imposed upon artists by the newly established ''[[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]]'' (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) and the ''[[Académie royale d'architecture]]'' (Royal Academy of Architecture). It had an important influence upon the architecture of other European monarchs, from [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia to [[Peter the Great]] of Russia. Major architects of the period included [[François Mansart]], [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], [[Robert de Cotte]], [[Pierre Le Muet]], [[Charles Perrault]], and [[Louis Le Vau]]. Major monuments included the [[Palace of Versailles]], the [[Grand Trianon]] at Versailles, and the Church of [[Les Invalides]] (1675–91).

The Louis XIV style had three periods. During the first period, which coincided with the youth of the King (1643-1660) and the regency of [[Anne of Austria]], architecture and art were strongly influenced by the earlier style of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and by the [[Baroque]] style imported from Italy. The early period saw the beginning of French classicism, particularly in the early works of [[Francois Mansart]], such as the [[Chateau de Maisons]] (1630–51). During the second period (1660-1690), under the personal rule of the King, the style of architecture and decoration became more classical, triumphant and ostentatious, expressed in the building of the [[Chateau of Versailles]], first by [[Louis Le Vau]] and then [[Jules Hardouin Mansart|Jules Hardouin-Mansart]].&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''Caractéristique des styles' ' (1988), pg.  120''&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1680, furniture was massive, decorated with a profusion of sculpture and gilding. In the later period, thanks to the development of the craft of [[marquetry]], the furniture was decorated with different colors and different woods. The most prominent creator of furniture in the later period was [[André Charles Boulle]].&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot, Paris (in French), pg. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The final period of Louis XIV style, from about 1690 to 1715, is called the period of transition; it was influenced by Hardouin-Mansart and by the King's designer of fetes and ceremonies, [[Jean Bérain the Elder]]. The new style was lighter in form, and featured greater fantasy and freedom of line, thanks in part to the use of [[wrought iron]] decoration, and greater use of [[arabesque]], [[grotesque]]  and coquille designs, which continued into the [[Louis Quinze|style of Louis XV]].{{sfn|Ducher|1988|p. 120}}

==Civil architecture==
The model of civic architecture in the early part of the reign was [[Vaux le Vicomte]] (1658), by [[Louis Le Vau]], built for the King's chief of finance [[Nicolas Fouquet]] and completed in 1658. Louis XIV charged Fouquet with theft, put him prison, and took the building for himself. The design was strongly influenced by the classicism of [[François Mansart]]. It combined a facade dominated and rhymed by colossal classical columns, beneath a dome, imported from the [[Italian Baroque architecture]], along with a number of original features, such as a semicircular salon which looked out on the vast [[French formal garden]] created by [[André Le Nôtre]].{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pg. 122}}

Based on the success of Vaux le Vicomte, Louis XIV selected Le Vau to construct an immense new palace at Versailles, to augment a smaller palace transformed from a hunting lodge by Louis XIII. This gradually became, over the decades, the master work of the Louis XIV style. Following the death of Le Vau in 1680, [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] took over the Versailles project; he broke away from the picturesque projections and dome and made a more sober and uniform facade of columns, with a flat roof topped by a balustrade and row of columns (1681). He used the same style to harmonize the other new buildings he created at Versailles, including the Orangerie and the Stables. Hardouin-Mansart constructed the [[Grand Trianon]] (completed 1687), single-story royal retreat with arched windows alternating with pairs of columns, and a flat roof and balustrade.

Another major new project undertaken by Louis was the construction of a new facade for the east side of the Louvre. Louis invited the most famous sculptor architect of the Italian Baroque, [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], to submit a design, but rejected it in favor of a more sober and classical colonnade by [[Claude Perrault|Perrault]] (1668).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Religious architecture==

In the early period of his reign, Louis began building the church of [[Val-de-Grâce (church)|Val-de-Grâce]] (1645-1710), the chapel of the Val-de-Grace hospital. The design was worked on successively by [[Hardouin Mansart|Mansart]], [[Jacques Lemercier]] and [[Pierre Le Muet]] before being completed by [[Gabriel Leduc]]. Its picturesque tripartite facade, peristyle, detached columns, statues, and ''[[Tondo (art)|tondi]]'', make it the most Italianate and Baroque of Paris churches. It served as the prototype for the later domes of [[Les Invalides]] and the [[Pantheon (Paris)|Pantheon]].{{sfn|Ducher (1988) pg. 124}}

The next major church built under Louis XIV was the church of [[Les Invalides]] (1680-1706). The nave of the church, by [[Libéral Bruant]], was comparable to those of other churches of the period, with ionic pilasters and penetratining vaults, and an interior that resembled the high baroque style. The dome, by Hardouin-Mansart, was more revolutionary, sitting upon a structure with the plan of a [[Greek Cross]]. The design used superimposed orders of columns, in the classical style, but the dome achieved greater height, by resting on a double ''tambour''or drum, and the facade and dome itself were richly decorated with sculptures, ''entablements'' in niches, and ornaments of gilded bronze alternating with the ''nervures'', or ribs of the dome.{{sfn|Ducher (1988) pg. 124}}

The finest church interior of the late Louis XIV period is the chapel of the [[Chateau of Versailles]], created between 1697 and 1710 by [[Hardouin Mansart|Hardouin-Mansart]] and his successor as court architect, [[Robert de Cotte]].  The decor was carefully restrained, with light colors and sculptural detail in slight relief on the columns.  The interior of the chapel opened up and lightened by the use of classical columns placed on the tribune, one level above the ground floor, to support the weight of the vaulted ceiling.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=124}}

== The Grand Style: Paris ==
Though Louis XIV was later accused of having ignored Paris, his reign saw several massive architectural projects which opened up space and ornamented the center of the city. The idea of monumental urban squares surrounded by uniform architecture had begun in Italy, like many architectural ideas of Baroque period. The first such square in Paris was the Place Royal (now [[Place des Vosges]]) begun by [[Henry IV of France]], completed with an equestrian statue of Louis XIII; then the [[Place Dauphine]] on the [[Ile de la Cité]], which featured an equestrian statue of Henry IV. The initial grand Paris projects of Louis XIV were new facades on the Louvre, one facing the Seine, the other facing to the east. These were showcases of the new monumental style of Louis XIV. The old brick and stone of the Henry IV squares was replaced by the Grand Style of monumental columns, which usually were part of the facade itself, rather than standing separately. All the buildings around the square were connected and built to the same height, in the same style. The ground floor featured a covered arcade for pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;Texier, Simon (2012), pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such complex of buildings built under Louis XIV was the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]] (now the [[Institut de France]]) (1662–68), facing the Louvre. It was designed by [[Louis Le Vau]] and [[François d'Orbay]], and combined the headquarters of the academies founded by the King, a chapel, and the library of [[Cardinal Mazarin]]. The [[Les Invalides|Hôtel Royal des Invalides]] - a complex for war veterans consisting of residences, a hospital, and a chapel - was constructed by [[Libéral Bruant]] and [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]] (1671-1679). Louis XIV then commissioned Mansart to construct a separate private royal chapel featuring a striking dome, the Église du Dôme, which was added to complete the complex in 1708.

The next major project was the [[Place des Victoires]] (1684-1697), a real estate development of seven large buildings in three segments around an oval square, with an equestrian statue of Louis XIV planned for the centerpiece. This was built by an enterprising entrepreneur and nobleman of the court, Jean-Baptiste Prédot, combined with the architect Jules Haroudin-Mansart. The final urban project became the best-known, the [[Place Vendôme]], also by Harouin-Mansart, between 1699 and 1702. In another innovation, this project was partially financed by the sale of lots around the square. All of these projects featured monumental facades in the Louis XIV style, giving a particular harmony to the squares.&lt;ref&gt;Texier, Simon (2012), pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior decoration==
In the early Louis XIV style, the principle characteristics of decor were a richness of materials and an effort to achieve a monumental effect. The materials used included marble, often combined with multicolor stones, bronze, paintings, and mirrors. These were inserted into an extremely framework of columns, pilasters, niches, which extended up the walls and up upon the ceiling. The doors were surrounded with medallions, frontons and bas-reliefs. The chimneys were smaller than those during the Louis XIII era, but more ornate, with a marble shelf supporting vases, below a carved frame with a painting or mirrors, all surrounded by a thick border of carved leaves or flowers. 

Decrative elements on the walls of the early Louis XIV style were usually intended to celebrate the military success, majesty and cultural achievements of the King. They often featured military trophies, with helmets, oak leaves symbolizing victory, and masses of weapons, usually made of glided bronze or sculpted wood, in relief surrounded by marble. Other decorative elements celebrated the King personally: the head of the King was often represented as the sun god [[Apollo]], surrounded by palm leaves or gilded rays of light. An eagle usually represented [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. Other ornamental details included gilded numbers, royal batons, and crowns.

The [[Hall of Mirrors]] of the Palace of Versailles (1678-1684) was the summit of the early Louis XIV style.  Designed by [[Charles Le Brun]], it combined a richness of materials (marble, gold, and bronze) which reflected in the mirrors.

In the late Louis XIV period, after 1690, new elements began to appear, that were less militaristic and more fantastic; particularly seashells, surrounded by elaborate sinuous lines and curves; and exotic designs, including [[arabesques]] and [[Chinoiserie]].{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages 126-129}}

==Furniture==
{{Main|Louis XIV furniture}}
During the first period of the reign of Louis XIV, furniture followed the previous style of Louis XIII, and was massive, and profusely decorated with sculpture and gilding. After 1680, thanks in large part to the furniture designer [[André Charles Boulle]], a more original and delicate style appeared. It was based on the inlay of [[ebony]] and other rare woods, a technique first used in Florence in the 15th century, which was refined and developed by Boulle and others working for Louis XIV.  Furniture was inlaid with plaques of ebony, copper, and exotic woods of different colors.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

New and often enduring types of furniture appeared;  the [[commode]], with two to four drawers, replaced the old ''coffre'', or chest. The ''canapé'', or sofa, appeared, in the form of a combination of two or three armchairs. New kinds of armchairs appeared, including the ''fauteuil en confessionale'' or "Confessional armchair", which had padded cushions ions on either side of the back of the chair.  The console table also made its first appearance; it was designed to be placed against a wall. Another new type of furniture was the ''table à gibier'', a marble-topped table for holding dishes. Early varieties of the desk appeared; the [[Bureau Mazarin|Mazarin desk]] had a central section set back, placed between two columns of drawers, with four feet on each column.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==

In the first part of the reign, French painters were largely influenced by the Italians, particularly [[Caravaggio]]. Notable French painters included [[Nicolas Poussin]], who was living in Rome; [[Claude Lorrain]], who specialized in landscapes and spent most of his career in Rome; [[Louis Le Nain]], who, along with his brothers, did mostly genre works; [[Eustache Le Sueur]], and [[Charles Le Brun]], who studied with Poussin in Rome and were influenced by him. 

With the death in 1661 of [[Cardinal Mazarin]], the King's prime minister, Louis decided to take personal charge of all aspects of government, including the arts. His chief advisor on the arts was [[Jean Colbert]] (1619-1683), who was also his finance minister. In 1663 Colbert reorganized the Royal furniture workshops, which made a wide variety of luxury goods, and added to it the [[Gobelins Manufactory|Gobelins tapestry workshops]]. At the same time, with the assistance of Le Brun, Colbert took charge of the [[Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]], which had been founded by Cardinal Mazarin. Colbert also took a dominant role in architecture, taking the title of Superintendent of buildings in 1664. In 1666, the French Academy in Rome was founded, to take advantage of Rome's position as the leading art center of Europe, and to assure a stream of well-trained painters. Le Brun became the dean of French painters under Louis XIV, involved in architectural projects and interior design.  His notable decorative works included the ceiling of the [[Hall of Mirrors]] in the Palace of Versailles.{{Sfn|Bauer and Prater|2016|Page=16}}

The major painters of the later reign of Louis XIV included [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]] (1659-1743) who came to Paris in 1681, and attracted the attention of LeBrun.  LeBrun oriented him toward portrait painting, and he made a celebrated portrait of Louis XIV in 1701, surrounded by all the attributes of power, from the crown on the table to the red heels of his shoes. Rigaud soon had an elaborate workshop in place for making portraits of the nobility; he employed specialized artists to create the costumes and draperies, and others to paint the backgrounds, ranging from battlefields to gardens to salons, while he concentrated on the composition, colors and especially the faces.{{Sfn|Bauer and Prater|2016|Page=16}}

[[George de la Tour]] (1593-1652) was another important figure in the Louis XIV style; he was given a title, named court painter of the King, and received high payments for his portraits, though he rarely ever came to Paris, preferring to work in his home town of [[Lunéville]]. His paintings, with their unusual light and dark effecs, were unusually somber, the figures barely seen in the darkness, lit by torchlight, evoking meditation and pity. In addition to religious scenes, he did genre paintings, including the famous ''Tricheur'' or card cheat, showing a young noble being cheated at cards while others look on passively. The writer and later French culture minister [[Andre Malraux]] wrote in 1951, "No other painter, not even Rembrandt, ever suggested such a vast and mysterious silence. La Tour is the only interpreter of the serene aspect of shadows."&lt;ref&gt;cited in Bauer and Prater, ''Baroque'', (2016) page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final years, Louis XIV's tastes changed again, under the influence of his morganic wife, [[Madame de Maintenon]], toward more religious and meditative themes. He had all the paintings in his private room removed and replaced by a single canvas, ''Saint Sebastien being tended by Saint Irene'' (c. 1649) by Georges de la Tour.{{Sfn|Bauer and Prater|2016|Page=86}}

==Sculpture==
The most influential sculptor of the period was the Italian [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], whose work in Rome inspired sculptors all over Europe. He traveled to France; his proposal for a new facade of the Louvre was rejected by the King, who wanted a more specifically French style, but the Bernini did make a bust of Louis XIV in 1665 which was greatly admired and imitated in France.

One of the most prominent sculptors under Louis XIV was [[Antoine Coysevox]] (pronounced "qualzevo") (1640-1720) from Lyon. He studied sculpture under [[Louis Lerambert]] and copied in marble ancient Roman works, including the [[Venus de Medici]]. In 1776, his bust of the King's official painter [[Charles Le Brun]] won him admission to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. He was soon producing monumental sculpture to accompany the new buildings constructed by Louis XIV; he made a Charlemagne for the royal chapel at [[Les Invalides]], and then a large number of statues for the new Park at Versailles and then at the [[Chateau de Marly]]. He originally made the outdoor statues in weather-resistant stucco, then replaced them with marble works when they were finished in 1705. His work of Neptune from Marly is now in the Louvre, and his statues of Pan and a Flora and Dryad are now found in the [[Tuileries Gardens]]. His statue of ''The King's Fame riding Pegasus'' was originally made for the Chateau of Marly. After the Revolution it was moved to the Tuileries Gardens, and is now inside the Louvre. He also made a series of greatly admired portrait sculptures of the leading statesmen and artists of the time; Louis XIV at Versailles, Colbert (for his tomb at the [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Church of Saint Eustache]]; [[Cardinal Mazarin]] in the [[Collège des Quatre-Nations]] (now the Institut de France) in Paris; the playwright [[Jean Racine]]; the architect [[Vauban]] and the garden designer [[Andre Le Notre]].&lt;ref&gt;''Coysevox, Charles Antoine'', by Hugh Chisholm from Encyclopedia Britannica 11th edition, (1911), pg. 355-56&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Sarazin]] was another notable sculptor working on projects for Louis XIV. He made many statues and decorations for the Palace of Versailles, as well as the [[Caryatids]] for the eastern facade of the Pavilion du Horloge of the Louvre, facing the Cour Carré, which were based both on a study of the original Greek models, and on the work of [[Michelangelo]].

Another notable sculptor of the Style Louis XV was [[Pierre Paul Puget]] (1620-1694), who was a sculptor, painter, engineer and architect. He was born in Marseille, and first sculpted ornaments for ships under construction. He then travelled to Italy, where he worked as an apprentice on the Baroque ceilings of the [[Palazzo Barberini]] and [[Palazzo Pitti]]. He travelled back and forth between Italy and France, painting, sculpting and wood-carving. He made his celebrated statue of [[caryatids]] for the city hall of Toulon in 1665-67, then was employed by [[Nicolas Fouquet]] to make a statue of Hercules for his chateau at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]]. He continued to live in th south of France, making notable statues of Milo of Croton, Perseus and Andromeda (now in the Louvre).&lt;ref&gt;''Puget, Pierre,'', by Hugh Chisholm from Encyclopedia Britannica 11th edition, (1911), pg. 637&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tapestries==
In 1662 [[Jean Baptiste Colbert]] purchased the tapestry workshop of a family of Flemish artisans and transformed it into a royal workshop for the manufacture of furniture and tapestries, under the name of [[Gobelins tapestry]]. Colbert placed the workshop under the direction of the royal court painter, [[Charles Le Brun]], who served in that position from 1663 until 1690. The workshop worked closely with the major painters of the court, who produced the designs. After 1697 the enterprise was reorganized, and thereafter was devoted entirely to the production of tapestries for the King.&lt;ref&gt;"Gobelin". Encyclopædia Britannica. Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911).  Cambridge University Press. p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

The themes and styles of the tapestry were largely similar to the themes in the paintings of the period, celebrating the majesty of the King and triumphal scenes of military victories, mythological and pastoral scenes. While at first they were made only for use of the King and nobility, the factory soon began exporting its products to the other courts of Europe.

The royal Gobelins manufactory had competition from two private enterprises, the [[Beauvais Manufactory]] and the [[Aubusson tapestry]] workshop, which produced works in the same style but with a low-warp process, with slightly lesser quality. [[Jean Bérain the Elder]], the royal draftsman and designer of the King, created a series of grotesque carpets for Aubusson. These tapestries sometimes celebrated contemporary themes, such as a work designed by Aubusson An late 17th to early 18th century tapestry done by the Beauvais Manufactory depicting Chinese astronomers at the Beijing Ancient Observatory using new more accurate instruments brought to them by Europeans (Jesuits) which were installed in 1644.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Design and spectacle==
In the early years of the King's reign, the most important public royal ceremony was the ''[[carrousel]]'',  a series of exercises and games on horseback. These events were designed to replace the tournament, which had been banned after 1559 when King [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] was killed in a jousting accident. In the new, less dangerous version, riders usually had to pass their lance through the interior of a ring, or strike mannequins with the heads of Medusa, Moors and Turks. A grand ''carrousel'' was held on June 5–6, 1662 to celebrate the birth of the ''Dauphin'', the son of Louis XIV. It was held on the square separating the Louvre from the Tuileries Palace, which afterwards became known as the Place du Carrousel.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|page=754}}

The ceremonial entry of the King into Paris also became an occasion for festivities. The return of Louis XIV and Queen Marie-Thérèse to Paris after his coronation in 1660 was celebrated by a grand event on a fairground at the gates of the city, where large thrones were constructed for the new monarchs. After the ceremony the site became known as the Place du Trône, or place of the Throne, until it became the [[Place de la Nation]] in 1880.{{sfn|''Dictionnaire historique de Paris''|2013|page=272}}

An office existed in the royal household of Louis XIV called [[Menus-Plaisirs du Roi]], which was responsible the decoration at royal ceremonies and spectacles, including ballets, masques, illuminations, fireworks, theater performances and other entertainments. This office was held from 1674 to 1711 by [[Jean Bérain the Elder]] (1640-1711). He was also designer of the King's bedchamber and offices, and had an enormous influence upon what became known as the Style Louis XIV; his studio was located in the Grand Gallery of the Louvre, along with those of the royal furniture designer [[André Charles Boulle]]. He was particularly responsible for introducing the a modified version of the [[grotesque]] style of ornament, originally created in Italy by Raphael, into French interior design. He used the grotesque stele not only on wall panels, but also on tapestries made by the [[Aubusson tapestry]] workshops. His many varied other designs included the highly-ornate design of transom of the warship ''Soleil Royal'' (1670), named for the King.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). "Bérain, Jean". Encyclopædia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to interior decoration, he designed the costumes and scenery for the royal theaters, including for the opera ''[[Amadis (Lully)|Amadis]]'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] performed at the [[Théâtre du Palais-Royal (rue Saint-Honoré)|Theater of the Palais Royal]] (1684), and for the opera-ballet ''Les Saisons'' by Lully's successor, [[Pascal Colasse]], in 1695.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

==The garden ''à la Française''==
One of the most enduring and popular forms of the Style Louis XIV is The ''Jardin à la française'' or [[French formal garden]], a style based on [[symmetry]] and the principle of imposing order on nature. The most famous example is the [[Gardens of Versailles]] designed by [[André Le Nôtre]], which inspired copies all across Europe. The first important garden à la française was the Chateau of [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]], created by [[Nicolas Fouquet]], the superintendent of Finances to Louis XIV, beginning in 1656. Fouquet commissioned [[Louis Le Vau]] to design the chateau, [[Charles Le Brun]] to design statues for the garden, and [[André Le Nôtre]] to create the gardens. For the first time, that garden and the chateau were perfectly integrated. A grand perspective of 1500 meters extended from the foot of the chateau to the statue of the Hercules of Farnese; and the space was filled with parterres of evergreen shrubs in ornamental patterns, bordered by colored sand, and the alleys were decorated at regular intervals by statues,  basins, fountains, and carefully sculpted topiaries.  "The symmetry attained at Vaux achieved a degee of perfection and unity rarely equalled in the art of classic gardens. The chateau is at the center of this strict spatial organization which symbolizes power and success."&lt;ref&gt;Prevot, ''Histoire des jardins'', pg. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gardens of Versailles, created by [[André Le Nôtre]] between 1662 and 1700, were the greatest achievement of the Garden à la francaise. They were the largest gardens in Europe – with an area of 15,000 hectares, and were laid out on an east–west axis followed the course of the sun: the sun rose over the Court of Honor, lit the Marble Court, crossed the Chateau and lit the bedroom of the King, and set at the end of the Grand Canal, reflected in the mirrors of the Hall of Mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Prevot, ''Histoire des jardins'', pg. 152&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast with the grand perspectives, reaching to the horizon, the garden was full of surprises – fountains, small gardens filled with statuary, which provided a more human scale and intimate spaces. The central symbol of the Garden was the sun; the emblem of [[Louis XIV]],  illustrated by the statue of [[Apollo]] in the central fountain of the garden. "The views and perspectives, to and from the palace, continued to infinity. The king ruled over nature, recreating in the garden not only his domination of his territories, but over the court and his subjects."&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Impelluso, ''Jardins, potagers et labyrinthes'', pg. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal''''' is a 2009 book by [[Ben Mezrich]] about the founding of [[Facebook]],&lt;ref name=moneycnn&gt;{{cite web|last=Hempel |first=Jessi |url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/06/25/technology/founding_of_facebook.fortune/index.htm |title=The Book that Facebook Doesn't Want You to Read|publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; adapted by [[Columbia Pictures]] for the 2010 film ''[[The Social Network]]''. Co-founder [[Eduardo Saverin]] served as Mezrich's main consultant,&lt;ref name=moneycnn /&gt; although [[Mark Zuckerberg]] declined to speak with him while the book was being researched. After Zuckerberg and Saverin settled their lawsuit, Saverin broke off contact with the author.

== Sources ==
Ben Mezrich maintains that the book is not a work of fiction despite his narrative style of writing. Some of his sources are his conversations with Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin and the court documents made available to him because of "all these college kids suing each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com/entry/2010-10-23T08_05_51-07_00 |title=Podomatic interview with Ben Mezrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Maslin|Maslin, Janet]]. (2009-07-19). [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/books/20maslin.html "Harvard Pals Grow Rich: Chronicling Facebook Without Face Time"] at ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The story begins in the weeks that precede the launch of "thefacebook.com" at Harvard.  Eduardo Saverin, cast as the protagonist, has befriended Mark Zuckerberg, and both struggle for social acceptance—Saverin by joining a [[final club]], Zuckerberg by creating a website where girls can be ranked according to their looks.  Zuckerberg's stunt, though successful, puts him at odds with the Harvard Administrative Board, and has angered numerous campus women's groups as well as individual female students.  An article on the incident in the [[Harvard Crimson]] is noticed by three Harvard seniors: [[Winklevoss twins|twin brothers]] [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]] and [[Divya Narendra]], all of whom who are trying to launch a Harvard dating site.  The trio approaches Zuckerberg, convincing him to join in the venture.  Zuckerberg, however, feels their site does not have what he thinks is the right approach and begins developing thefacebook with financial help from Saverin and programming from Zuckerberg's roommates.

Once thefacebook.com is launched it becomes an immediate hit on campus.  After discovering what Zuckerberg has done, the Winklevoss' and Narendra are infuriated and seek legal advice from their father's lawyer.  The story then chronicles the changing relationship between Saverin and Zuckerberg, who have different visions for thefacebook.

While the first half of the book centers on the Harvard University campus and focuses on college life, the second half centers on the business end of thefacebook and Zuckerberg's move to [[Silicon Valley]].

'''The Foremen''' were a satirical [[folk music]] band from [[Los Angeles]] founded by [[Roy Zimmerman (satirist)|Roy Zimmerman]]. They were known for their politically charged lyrics, which usually discussed United States politics from a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] point of view, such as by mocking [[Rush Limbaugh]].&lt;ref name=Trib/&gt;

==History==
Zimmerman originally started the band in 1990, after seeing a Wayfarers album in the bargain bin at a [[record store]]. He then recruited Doug Whitney and Andy Corwin—a guitarist and bassist, respectively—to join his newly formed band.&lt;ref name=Allmusic&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-foremen-mn0000067694 | title=Foremen Biography | work=[[Allmusic]] | accessdate=12 May 2014 | author=Harris, Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band released a live album, ''Sing it Loud'', on Metaphor Records, and were signed to [[Reprise Records]] after [[Jim Ed Norman]], then head of the [[Warner Bros. Nashville]] label, heard them at a party. Norman was so impressed that he signed the Foremen to a recording contract on Reprise, one of Warner Music's subsidiaries,&lt;ref name=Allmusic/&gt; and went on to produce their debut album.&lt;ref name=Trib/&gt; It was on Reprise that they released both of their studio albums, ''Folk Heroes'' and ''What's Left''. They also released a single from the former album, "Ain't No Liberal", in 1995, which featured an image of Republican politician [[Phil Gramm]] on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/506833/the-foremen-take-shot-at-phil-graham/ | title=The Foremen Take Shot At Phil Graham | work=[[MTV News]] | date=14 January 1996 | accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reprise promoted by sending copies of it to presidential candidates in the [[1996 US Presidential election]], and mocking presidential candidate [[Pete Wilson]] in the single's cover art. Reprise's then-president, [[Howie Klein]], admitted that their motivation for doing this was to provoke a "counterattack" from one of the politicians they were mocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-09-23/entertainment/ca-49266_1_pete-wilson | title=Poppin' Up: Foremen Leap Into Political Arena With 'No Liberal' | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=23 September 1995 | accessdate=12 May 2014 | author=Hochman, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1996, the band performed a song mocking [[Oliver North]], entitled "Ollie, Ollie, Off Scot Free", on North's own radio show. While the band was nervous prior to this performance, North's reaction was not as negative as they had expected. He didn't care very much what the song said, only that it was about him, according to Zimmerman. North also described the band as a "very weird group" and agreed to pose for a picture with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-10-11/entertainment/9610110018_1_foremen-ollie-radio-show | title=Politics Liberally Applied | work=Chicago Tribune | date=11 October 1996 | accessdate=12 May 2014 | author=Hurst, Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Zimmerman has said that the political views expressed in his band's songs are influenced in part by the activism popular in the 1960s, and has named "[[Tom Lehrer]] and [[Phil Ochs]] and, to a lesser degree, I guess,...[[Pete Seeger]] and the honest-to-God activism that was going on in music at that time [i.e. the 1960s]" as his band's influences.&lt;ref name=Trib&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-12-15/entertainment/9512150129_1_foremen-warner-lake-erie | title=Foremen Lean To The Left And To Humor | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=15 December 1995 | accessdate=12 May 2014 | author=Hurst, Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitney has also described the band as "partly a goof on the lesser folk groups of the late '50s,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-25/entertainment/ca-1498_1_political-satire | title=What's Funny, Fractured and Folk? | work=Los Angeles Times | date=25 November 1994 | accessdate=12 May 2014 | author=Crisafulli, Chuck}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Billboard'' magazine has compared the satirical aspects of the Foremen's music to [[Allan Sherman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=%22The+Foremen%22+reprise&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WYxxU4zXO4ussASZqoG4Dw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6wEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sherman&amp;f=false | title=Pioneering Warner Bros. Remains Comedy Kingpin | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=28 September 1996 | accessdate=12 May 2014 | author=Rosen, Craig | pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Walsh has concurred with Zimmerman that the Foremen's music resembles that of Phil Ochs, as well as naming [[Steve Goodman]] as one of their influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alb.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=5827077 | title=Record Reviews Folk | work=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]] | date=18 August 1996 | accessdate=6 June 2014 | author=Walsh, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Jenkins of ''[[the Washington Post]]'' wrote that "Though the Foremen's "Folk Heroes" arrives with an endorsement from '60s musical satirist Tom Lehrer, it's not especially folkie—nor so biting as Lehrer's best."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1996/01/19/predictable-foremen/be6b3e7b-a4e4-4420-89e4-e9a6800bca83/ |title=Predictable Foremen |last=Jenkins |first=Mark |date=1996-01-19 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=2017-07-30 |last2=Jenkins |first2=Mark |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Onion Field''''' is a 1973 nonfiction book by [[Joseph Wambaugh]], a sergeant for the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], chronicling the kidnapping of two [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] LAPD officers by a pair of criminals during a traffic stop and the subsequent murder of one of the officers.

== Crime ==
On the night of March 9, 1963, LAPD officers Ian Campbell (age 31) and [[Karl Francis Hettinger|Karl Hettinger]] (age 28), both former Marines, were riding in an unmarked "felony" car.{{clarify|date=July 2018}}&lt;!-- what's a felony car? --&gt; They pulled over a 1946 Ford coupe containing two suspicious-looking men at the corner of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="Krajicek, David J"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Justice Story: Murder in the Onion Field|author= Krajicek, David J. |work=Special to The News (New York Daily News)| date=March 25, 2008 |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/justice-story-article-1.249124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070408/ap_en_ot/obit_smith_3|title='Onion Field' killer dead at 76|accessdate=2007-04-08|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070410200844/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070408/ap_en_ot/obit_smith_3 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  two men, [[Gregory Powell (murderer)|Gregory Ulas Powell]] (age 30) and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a. "Jimmy Youngblood", age 32), had recently committed a string of robberies, and "each had a pistol tucked into his trousers."&lt;ref name="Krajicek, David J"/&gt; Powell, the driver, pulled a gun on Campbell, who "calmly told his partner, 'He has a gun in my back. Give him your gun.'" The two officers were then forced into Powell's car and, within 30 seconds after the traffic stop began, were driven north from Los Angeles on Route 99, to an onion field near [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], where Campbell was fatally shot.&lt;ref name="Krajicek, David J"/&gt; Hettinger was able to escape, running nearly four miles to reach a farmhouse.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"/&gt;

The killing occurred primarily because Powell assumed that the kidnapping of the officers alone already constituted a [[capital punishment|capital crime]] under the state's [[Federal Kidnapping Act|Little Lindbergh Law]]. However, Powell's interpretation was incorrect.  Under the Little Lindbergh Law kidnapping became a capital crime only if the victim were harmed or if a ransom were demanded. (Today, kidnapping in [[California]], where there is bodily harm short of death, is punishable either by imprisonment for 25 years to life, or by [[life imprisonment]] without the possibility of [[parole]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Aftermath ==
In April 1982, following the release from prison of Powell's accomplice, Jimmy Lee Smith, Valerie Campbell, daughter of the slain Officer Ian Campbell, contacted John Mancino, founder of Citizens for Truth, an organization that had recently led a successful petition effort to rescind the parole date of convicted assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, killer of presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy.

Mancino drafted a petition to have Powell's scheduled release rescinded and with Valerie Campbell's help collected 31,500 signatures in three-and-a-half weeks, which were submitted to the California Board of Prison Terms, along with several thousand letters. The parole board then held a hearing and eventually rescinded Powell's release date.

Following this, Powell's attorney was successful in convincing Solano County Superior Court Judge, Ellis Randall, to order Powell's release from prison in ten days, ruling that Citizens for Truth's public outcry was the sole reason Powell's release was rescinded, which at the time was legally improper. Valerie Campbell then joined Citizens for Truth's representatives, John Mancino and Dr. Howard Garber, along with the group's attorneys, in filing a legal brief in the First District Court of Appeals in San Francisco, demanding that Powell remain in prison.

The group prevailed both at the appeals court and the California Supreme Court, thereby leading to Powell's spending the rest of his life in prison, where he died in 2012.

On August 10, 2012, the intersection of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street in Hollywood, the site of the officers' abduction, was named "Ian Campbell Square" in honor of the slain officer.  Additionally, a section of the Hollywood Freeway ([[California State Route 101]]) in Hollywood, from Hollywood Boulevard to Highland Avenue, was designated the "Ian J. Campbell Memorial Freeway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Onion Field Killer's Death Brings Closure for LAPD, Chief Says |date= August 13, 2012 |work= Los Angeles Times |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/08/onion-field-killer-lapd.html |access-date= April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hettinger===
{{main|Karl Francis Hettinger}}

Though Hettinger was able to escape, he felt scorned by his fellow officers and officials at the Los Angeles Police Department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/09/local/me-powers9 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Myrna | last=Oliver | title=John W. Powers, 90; Legendary Officer in LAPD for 31 Years | date=December 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suffered severe emotional trauma for both the initial incident and the following treatment. Eventually a [[police training]] video was made using his experience as an example of what {{em|not}} to do when stopping and approaching a vehicle.

Hettinger was forced to resign from the LAPD in 1966, after being accused of shoplifting. Years later, Hettinger was elected to serve as a Supervisor for Kern County, California, where he served multiple consecutive terms. He died of [[liver disease]] in 1994, at the age of 59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Malnic, Eric |work=Los Angeles Times| date= May 5, 1994 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-05/news/mn-53959_1_onion-field|title=Karl Hettinger; Survived 1963 'Onion Field' Attack|accessdate=  January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The suspects===
Powell was arrested on the night of the murder, after being spotted driving a stolen vehicle by California Highway Patrol officers. The following day, Smith was apprehended as well. The lead LAPD investigator on the case was Sergeant Pierce Brooks. Both suspects were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Ultimately, they received [[life sentence]]s. For each, the [[lower court]] sentence followed a second trial and several appeals. Their death sentences were vacated when the [[California Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[California v. Anderson]]'' (1972) that California's death penalty was [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Special to The News|title=The Justice Story: Murder in the Onion Field

====Powell====
{{main|Gregory Powell (murderer)}}

At a [[parole board]] hearing on January 27, 2010, Powell was denied parole. In a January 21, 2010 letter to state [[corrections]] officials, Los Angeles Police Union President Paul Weber urged the board to deny parole, calling Powell a "vicious murderer who has not yet paid his debt to society".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On October 18, 2011, the California State [[Parole Board]] denied [[compassionate release]] for Powell, who had been diagnosed with terminal [[prostate cancer]]. The board stated that Powell did not wish to be released from prison and was likely to be uncooperative if paroled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]] |date=October 18, 2011|title= 'Onion Field' Killer Will Not Be Released|work=Associated Press|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/us/onion-field-killer-will-not-be-released.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Powell died on August 12, 2012, at the [[California Medical Facility]] in [[Vacaville, California|Vacaville]]. He was 79 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 13, 2012|title='Onion Field' Killer Dies in Calif. Prison|work=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Smith====
Smith was initially released in 1982 but returned to prison several additional times on drug-related parole violations. In December 2006, he failed to report to his [[parole officer]], and a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] was issued for his arrest. In February 2007, a man matching Smith's description was detained by police in Los Angeles' [[Skid Row, Los Angeles, California|Skid Row]] area and eventually identified as Smith. He was arrested, charged with violating his parole, and sent to the Pitchess Detention Center in [[Castaic, California]]. On April 7, 2007, while in that facility, he died of an apparent [[heart attack]] at age 76.&lt;ref name="latobit"&gt;{{cite news|author=Quinones, Sam |date=April 7, 2007|title= Jimmy Lee Smith, infamous 'Onion Field' cop killer, dead at 76|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/jimmy-lee-smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film and television adaptations ==
The book was adapted into an [[The Onion Field (film)|1979 film of the same name]] directed by [[Harold Becker]]. It starred [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] as Karl Hettinger, [[James Woods]] as Gregory Powell, [[Franklyn Seales]] as Jimmy Smith, and [[Ted Danson]] (in his film debut) as Ian Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/13/entertainment/la-et-mn-the-onion-field-murder-movie-ted-danson-james-woods-in-1979-20120813|title='The Onion Field' film played role in keeping killer behind bars|last=King|first=Susan|date=2012-08-13|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]]'s ''[[Southland (TV series)|Southland]]'' season 5 episode 9 titled "Chaos" (original airdate April 10, 2013) portrayed a reimagined version of the events that took place in ''The Onion Field''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Hitfix|author=Sepinwall, Alan|url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-southland-chaos-the-onion-field|title=Review: 'Southland' - 'Chaos': The onion field|date= April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.southlandfirst.com/2013/04/southland-s5e9-chaos-review.html| date=April 12, 2013|work=SouthLand First|title=SouthLAnd S5E9 "Chaos" review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Adam-12]]'' episode "Killing Ground" was based on this incident. Officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed are kidnapped by two armed robbers on the run. The only difference is Malloy and Reed are able to escape and turn the tables on their captors.

'''''The Persistence of Memory''''' ({{lang-ca|La persistència de la memòria}}) is a 1931 [[painting]] by artist [[Salvador Dalí]], and one of his most recognizable works. First shown at the [[Julien Levy Gallery]] in 1932, since 1934 the painting has been in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) in [[New York City]], which received it from an anonymous donor. It is widely recognized and frequently referenced in popular culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff editor|title=Dali, The Flamboyant Surrealist|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z2lcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tVYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=dal%C3%AD%20melting%20watch&amp;pg=4025%2C4123936|accessdate=20 June 2011|newspaper=The Vindicator|date=28 January 1989|quote=The death of Salvador Dali evokes the image of his most famous painting, ''Persistence of Memory''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes referred to by more descriptive (though incorrect) titles, such as "Melting Clocks", "The Soft Watches" or "The Melting Watches".{{by whom?|date=June 2017}}

==Description==
The well-known [[surrealist]] piece introduced the image of the soft melting [[pocket watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=Kirsten|title=Essential Dalí|year=1999|publisher=;Dempsey Parr|isbn=978-1-84084-509-9|quote=It includes the first appearance of what is perhaps his most enduring image: the 'soft watch'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It epitomizes Dalí's theory of "softness" and "hardness", which was central to his thinking at the time. As [[Dawn Adès]] wrote, "The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order".&lt;ref&gt;Ades, Dawn. Dalí. Thames and Hudson, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation suggests that Dalí was incorporating an understanding of the world introduced by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of special relativity]]. Asked by [[Ilya Prigogine]] whether this was in fact the case, Dalí replied that the soft watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a [[Camembert]] melting in the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Salvador Dali |date=2008 |title=The Dali Dimension: Decoding the Mind of a Genius |format=DVD |publisher=Media 3.14-TVC-FGSD-IRL-AVRO|url=http://www.dalidimension.com/eng/index.html|quote=Surprisingly, Dalí said that his soft watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a Camembert cheese melting in the sun. The painter insisted on this explanation in his reply letter to Prigogine, who took it as Dalí's reaction to Einstein's coldly mathematical theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to recognize a human figure in the middle of the composition, in the strange "monster" (with a lot of texture near its face, and lots of contrast and tone in the picture) that Dalí used in several contemporary pieces to represent himself – the abstract form becoming something of a self-portrait, reappearing frequently in his work. The figure can be read as a "fading" creature, one that often appears in dreams where the dreamer cannot pinpoint the creature's exact form and composition. One can observe that the creature has one closed eye with several eyelashes, suggesting that the creature is also in a dream state. The iconography may refer to a dream that Dalí himself had experienced, and the clocks may symbolize the passing of time as one experiences it in sleep or the persistence of time in the eyes of the dreamer.

The orange clock at the bottom left of the painting is covered in ants. Dalí often used ants in his paintings as a symbol of decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danilian symbolism I Salvador Dalí I Espace Dalí|url=http://daliparis.com/en/salvador-dali/dalinian-symbols|website=daliparis.com|accessdate=4 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925181611/http://daliparis.com/en/salvador-dali/dalinian-symbols|archive-date=25 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MoMA I Salvador Dalí.

The fly appears to be casting a human shadow as the sun hits it. ''The Persistence of Memory'' employs "the exactitude of realist painting techniques"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7qeHVrQ5X-MC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=Persistence+of+Memory+Dali+dream+surrealism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7ejjTdHmO8zOgAeOqfGYBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=exactitude%20realist%20painting%20techniques&amp;f=false "Dali's dream environments were represented through the exactitude of realist painting techniques, like those found in his ''Persistence of Memory'' (1931)." ''Surrealism and Architecture'', by Thomas Mical; Psychology Press, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; to depict imagery more likely to be found in dreams than in waking consciousness.

The craggy rocks to the right represent a tip of [[Cap de Creus]] peninsula in north-eastern [[Catalonia]]. Many of Dalí's paintings were inspired by the landscapes of his life in Catalonia. The strange and foreboding shadow in the foreground of this painting is a reference to Mount Pani.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moodbook.com/history/modernism/salvador-dali-surreal.html Salvador Dali.

Dalí returned to the theme of this painting with the variation ''[[The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory]]'' (1954), showing his earlier famous work systematically fragmenting into smaller component elements, and a series of rectangular blocks which reveal further imagery through the gaps between them, implying something beneath the surface of the original work; this work is now in the [[Salvador Dalí Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], while the original ''Persistence of Memory'' remains at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]]. Dalí also produced various [[lithograph]]s and [[sculpture]]s on the theme of soft watches late in his career. Some of these sculptures are the ''Persistence of Memory'', the ''Nobility of Time'', the ''Profile of Time'', and the ''Three Dancing Watches''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalisculptureeditions.com/Index.asp?Sez=Sculpture Dalis Sculpture Editions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708222040/http://www.dalisculptureeditions.com/Index.asp?Sez=Sculpture |date=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Tribuna of the Uffizi''''' (1772–1778) by [[Johan Zoffany]] is a painting of the north-east section of the [[Tribuna of the Uffizi|Tribuna]] room in the [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The painting is part of the United Kingdom's [[Royal Collection]].

==Production==
Johan Zoffany was a German-born painter who had become successful in London. One of his principal patrons was the Royal family. In the summer of 1772, Zoffany left London for Florence with a commission from [[Queen Charlotte]] to paint 'the Florence Gallery'.  (Neither she nor her husband [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] ever visited Italy in person.) The agreed price was high and Zoffany was paid £300.&lt;ref name=royal&gt;Royal Collection from Shawe-Taylor 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felton Hervey]], who had a large art collection and who knew the Royal family, met Zoffany in Florence. He was included in a prominent position in the painting by December 1772.&lt;ref name="painting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/851824 |title=The Hon. Felton Hervey (1712-1775) |work=National Trust Collections |publisher=National Trust  |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoffany was still working on the painting late in 1777; he only finally returned to England in 1779.&lt;ref name=royal/&gt; By this time Hervey had died.&lt;ref name="painting"/&gt;

==Artworks shown==
Zoffany has varied the arrangement of the artworks and introduced others from elsewhere in the [[House of Medici|Medici]] collection. He gained special privileges, with the help of [[George Clavering-Cowper, 3rd Earl Cowper|George, 3rd Earl Cowper]], and [[Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet]], such as having seven paintings, including Raphael's Madonna della Sedia, temporarily brought in from the [[Pitti Palace]] so that he could paint them in situ in the Tribuna. In thanks, Zoffany included a portrait of Cowper looking at his recent acquisition,&lt;ref name=key&gt;Farber 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael's [[Niccolini-Cowper Madonna]] (Cowper hoped to sell it on to George III; it is now in the Washington [[National Gallery of Art]]), with Zoffany holding it (to the left of the Dancing Faun).

The unframed ''Samian Sibyl'' on the floor was acquired for the Medici collection in 1777. It was a workshop copy of the pendant to [[Guercino]]'s ''[[Libyan Sibyl]]'', recently bought by George III, and may be intended as a compliment to him.

===Sculptures and other===
Today Medici's Ancient Roman statues are mostly in the main corridors of the Uffizi Gallery, except those which are still in the Tribuna, and except the smaller busts and statuettes (some antique, some pseudo-antique), owned by the [[National Archaeological Museum (Florence)|National Archaeological Museum]] and permanently displayed at [[Villa Corsini a Castello]], near Florence. Many of those painted by Zoffany are still to be identified, though. Other antiquities (Etruscan, Egyptian, Greek) are mostly in the National Archaeological Museum. Some very few Renaissance pieces from the Tribuna are now in the [[Bargello Museum]].

==Persons shown==

All of the connoisseurs, diplomats and visitors to Florence portrayed are identifiable, making the painting a combination of the British 18th-century [[Conversation piece (paintings)|conversation piece]] or informal group portrait genre, with that of the predominantly Flemish 17th-century tradition of gallery views and [[wunderkammer]]s. However, this inclusion of so many recognisable portraits led to criticism at the time by Zoffany's royal patrons, and by Horace Walpole, who called it "a flock of travelling boys, and one does not know nor care whom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Yale edition of Horace Walpole's correspondence  |volume=24 |pages=526–7 |chapterurl=http://images.library.yale.edu/hwcorrespondence/page.asp?vol=24&amp;page=526 |chapter=To MANN, Friday 12 November 1779 |editor-first=W.S. |editor-last=Lewis |year=1967|publisher=[[Lewis Walpole Library]] |location=Yale |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first group of people is around the Niccolini Madonna. From left, standing up, there are [[George Clavering-Cowper, 3rd Earl Cowper|George, 3rd earl of Cowper]], Sir [[John Dick (1720-1804)|John Dick]] [[Dick baronets|baronet of Braid]], [[Other Windsor, 6th Earl of Plymouth]], and [[Johann Zoffany]], the painter itself, followed on the other side of the painting by Mr. Stevenson and his companion [[George Legge, 3rd Earl of Dartmouth]], while is sitting on a chair [[Charles Loraine Smith]] and behind him, bended, [[Richard Edgcumbe, 2nd Earl of Mount Edgcumbe|Richard Edgcumbe]], later 2nd Earl of Mount Edgcumbe.

Two more connoisseurs are near the ''Satiro''. The first is reported to be [[Joseph Leeson, 2nd Earl of Milltown]], even if his portrait does not match in age and resemblance those in the [[National Gallery of Ireland]] by [[Pompeo Batoni]], and [[Valentine Knightley (painter)|Valentine Knightley]] of Fawsley. 

Further to the center of the painting [[Pietro Bastianelli]], curator of the Uffizi Gallery, shows the Venus of Urbino di Titian to John Gordon,{{#tag:ref|Described in contemporary Italian newspapers as "Mr. Gordon, an English official".&lt;ref name="nicholls152"&gt;Cited in Nicholls 2006, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;[[John Chambers (topographer)|John Chambers]] wrote in 1829 that Rev.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4362">The '''Warren–Brooks Award''' for literary criticism was established to honor the innovative, critical interpretation of literature offered by [[Robert Penn Warren]] and [[Cleanth Brooks]] to celebrate the continuation of such achievement. It is awarded for outstanding literary criticism originally published in English in the United States of America and is given in those years when a book, or other worthy publication, appears that exemplifies the Warren–Brooks effort in spirit, scope, and integrity.

The award is given annually by the advisory group of the Center for Robert Penn Warren Studies at [[Western Kentucky University]] for outstanding literary criticism originally published in English in the United States.

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 038.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A wise old man: "Philosopher in Meditation" by [[Rembrandt]]]]
The '''wise old man''' (also called '''senex''', [[Sage (philosophy)|'''sage''' or '''sophos''']]) is an [[archetype]] as described by [[Carl Jung]], as well as a classic [[literature|literary]] figure, and may be seen as a [[stock character]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p 151, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wise old man can be a profound [[philosopher]] distinguished for [[wisdom]] and sound [[judgment]].

== Traits ==
This type of character is typically represented as a kind and wise, older father-type figure who uses personal knowledge of people and the world to help tell stories and offer guidance that, in a mystical way, may impress upon his audience a sense of who they are and who they might become, thereby acting as a [[mentor]].  He may occasionally appear as an [[absent-minded professor]], appearing absent-minded due to a predilection for contemplative pursuits.

The wise old man is often seen to be in some way "foreign", that is, from a different culture, nation, or occasionally, even a different time, from those he advises.  In extreme cases, he may be a [[liminal being]], such as [[Merlin]], who was only half human.

In medieval chivalric [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] and modern [[fantasy literature]], he is often presented as a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]].&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'', p 195, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He can also or instead be featured as a [[hermit]].  This character type often explained to the [[Monomyth|knights or heroes]]—particularly those searching for the [[Holy Grail]]—the significance of their encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Penelope Reed |last=Doob |title=The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell University Press |pages=179–181 |isbn=0-8014-8000-0 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In storytelling, the character of the wise old man is commonly killed or in some other way removed for a time, in order to allow the hero to develop on his/her own.

== Jungian psychology ==

In [[Carl Jung|Jung]]ian [[analytical psychology]], '''senex''' is the specific term used in association with this archetype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Terrapsychology: Reengaging the Soul of Place|last= Chalquist|first= Craig|year= 2007|publisher= Spring Journal Books|isbn= 978-1-882670-65-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Rome, the title of Senex ([[Latin]] for ''old man'') was only awarded to elderly men with families who had good standing in their village. Examples of the senex [[archetype]] in a positive form include the wise old man or [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]. The senex may also appear in a negative form as a devouring [[father]] (e.g. [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], [[Cronus]]) or a doddering [[Foolishness|fool]].

In the [[individuation]] process, the archetype of the Wise old man was late to emerge, and seen as an indication of the [[Self (Jung)|Self]].  'If an individual has wrestled seriously enough and long enough with the [[anima and animus|anima]] (or animus) problem...the unconscious again changes its dominant character and appears in a new symbolic form...as a masculine initiator and guardian (an Indian ''guru''), a wise old man, a spirit of nature, and so forth'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Marie-Luise von |last=Franz |chapter=The Process of Individuation |editor-first=C. G. |editor-last=Jung |editor-link=Carl Gustav Jung |title=Man and his Symbols |location=London |publisher=Picador |year=1978 |pages=207–208 |isbn=0-330-25321-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antithetical archetype, or [[enantiodromia|enantiodromic opposite]], of the senex is the [[Puer Aeternus]].

== Cultural references ==

In fiction, due to the influence of [[Merlin]], a wise old man is often presented in the form of a wizard or other [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] in medieval chivalric [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] and  modern [[fantasy literature]] and [[films]]; notable examples include [[Gandalf]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and [[Albus Dumbledore]] from ''[[Harry Potter]]''. See List of magicians in fantasy for more examples.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The Elder Kettle, who serves as a father figure to the Cup Brothers in ''[[Cuphead]]'', closely follows this role. When the brothers get roped into The Devil's scheme to gather the contracts, it is the Elder Kettle who helps the brothers in their plan to eventually turn against their master.

"Senex" is a name of a wise old character in the novel ''[[A Wind in the Door]]'' by [[Madeleine L'Engle]].

Sir [[Alan Lascelles]] used the pen-name "Senex" when writing to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1950 setting out the so-called [[Lascelles Principles]] concerning the monarch's right to refuse a prime minister's request for a general election.

A character in episode 7 of the anime [[Ergo Proxy]]  is named Senex Proxy, and is the Agent of Moonlight. She is killed by Ergo Proxy. It is possible the name Senex is in reference to the age, and immortality of the Proxies.

In the roleplaying game [[Mage: The Ascension]], Senex is the wise old leader of the Euthanatos magickal tradition. He dwells in a far distant realm, only rarely stepping onto Earth.
