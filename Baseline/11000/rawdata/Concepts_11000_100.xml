      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5159">'''Accentuation effect''' occurs when something (be it a person, place or thing) is placed into a category, and aspects of it which match the stereotypes of that category are emphasized and perceived to be greater than they are, i.e. the similarities of an individual to the group are accentuated.  Memory of anything that can be categorized is subject to an accentuation effect in which the memory is distorted toward typical examples.

In the case of people, the accentuation effect is similar to [[Stereotype|stereotyping]] and social [[categorization]] in that when classified as part of a group, people's features seem to more closely match their [[classification]] rather than any individual differences they have.

==Within ethnicity and faces==
[[Research]]ers Corneille, Huart, Becquart, and Bredart found that when participants looked at ethnically [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]] faces, certain ethnic features that stood out caused participants to falsely remember the person more toward an ethnic category than they actually were. Researchers used [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] or [[North Africa]]n faces, and morphed them to be either low, moderate, or high on [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] features. The faces that were moderately stereotypical of either a [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Caucasian]] or [[North African]] person were falsely recollected in memory as more Caucasian or [[North African]] than they actually were. This is evidence for how distortions in memory are due to stereotypical conceptions that are held about certain [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]] {{harv |Corneille et al.|2004}}.last edit (2017)

==Within temperature estimates==
A study at [[Brown University]] found accentuation effects happened when participants were asked to [[Estimation|estimate]] average [[temperature]]s in days throughout the year. Typically, four days in a month were used, i.e., September 2, 10, 18, and 28, and the average high and low temperatures were estimated for each day. Results of this study found that when estimating the [https://www.google.com.pk/search?q=temperature&amp;oq=temperature&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8 temperature], there was more of a jump in temperature estimates between months as opposed to estimates within months. Even though the temperature rises and falls fairly steadily with each passing day through the year, participants assume there is more of a drop in temperature, for example, between August 25 and September 2 than there is between September 2 and September 10, based entirely on the idea that August is warmer than September. {{harv |Krueger |Clement|1994}}.

==Real examples==
One example that researchers presented was that after an [[Italians|Italian]] colleague returned from a two-week vacation in [[Italy]], his friends noticed that his hair and eyes were lighter than they had remembered. This happened because his categorization as Italian caused them to remember him with darker hair and eyes than he actually had. Thus, while there was no actual change in his hair and [[eye color]], their memory of his features had been shifted to match what the [[stereotype]] of an Italian looks like, rather than his actual appearance {{harv |Corneille et al.|2004}}.

'''''After Virtue''''' is a book on moral philosophy by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]].  MacIntyre provides a bleak view of the state of modern moral discourse, regarding it as failing to be rational, and failing to admit to being irrational.  He claims that older forms of moral discourse were in better shape, particularly singling out [[Aristotle]]'s [[moral philosophy]] as an exemplar.  ''After Virtue'' is among the most important texts in the recent revival of [[virtue ethics]].

The book was first published in 1981 and has since gone through two subsequent editions, which have added to, but not changed, the original text. The second edition, published in 1984, adds a postscript replying to critics of the first edition; the third edition, published in 2007, contains a new prologue entitled "''After Virtue'' After a Quarter of a Century".

==Summary==
MacIntyre holds that ''After Virtue'' makes seven central claims.&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre, "The Claims of ''After Virtue''", in Kelvin Knight (ed.), ''The MacIntyre Reader'' (University of Notre Dame Press, 1998), 69-72.&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with an [[allegory]] suggestive of the premise of the science-fiction novel ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'': a world where all sciences have been dismantled quickly and almost entirely. MacIntyre asks what the sciences would look like if they were re-assembled from the remnants of scientific knowledge that survived the catastrophe. 

He claims that the new sciences, though superficially similar to the old, would in fact be devoid of real scientific content, because the key suppositions and attitudes would not be present. "The hypothesis which I wish to advance," he continues, "is that in the actual world which we inhabit the language of morality is in the same state of grave disorder as the language of natural science in the imaginary world which I described."&lt;ref name=AV&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre, ''After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory'' (University of Notre Dame Press, 1984, 2nd edn.), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, MacIntyre applies this hypothesis to advance the notion that the moral structures that emerged from [[the Enlightenment]] were philosophically doomed from the start because they were formed using the aforementioned incoherent language of morality. MacIntyre claims that this failure encompasses the work of many significant Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment moral philosophers, including [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[David Hume]]. These philosophers "fail because of certain shared characteristics deriving from their highly specific historical background."&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;{{rp|51}} That background is the Enlightenment's abandonment of [[Aristotelianism]], and in particular the Aristotelian concept of [[teleology]]. 

Ancient and [[Scholasticism|medieval ethics]], argues MacIntyre, relied wholly on the teleological idea that human life had a proper end or character, and that human beings could not reach this natural end without preparation. Renaissance science rejected Aristotle's teleological [[physics]] as an incorrect and unnecessary account, which led Renaissance philosophy to make a similar rejection in the realm of ethics. But shorn of teleology, ethics as a body of knowledge was expurgated of its central content, and only remained as, essentially, a vocabulary list with few definitions and no context. With such an incomplete framework on which to base their moral understanding, the philosophers of the Enlightenment and their successors were doomed from the beginning.

MacIntyre illustrates this point through an example of a people who, he argues, experienced a similar incoherence in their own moral and ethical tradition: the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] people of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] and their [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|taboos]]. [[King Kamehameha II]] removed the taboos of the people in order to modernize their society and met little if any resistance.  The Polynesians had no issue with abandoning their long-standing cultural traditions and MacIntyre claims this is because the taboos, though once meaningful to the islanders, had been shorn over the centuries of their underlying spiritual and didactic purpose, becoming a set of arbitrary prohibitions. The fact that Kamehameha II could abolish them so easily and without opposition is evidence, MacIntyre argues, of their incoherence. A similar incoherence, he argues, bedevils the ethical project since the Enlightenment.

Another reason MacIntyre gives for the doomed nature of the Enlightenment is the fact that it ascribed moral agency to the individual. He claims this made morality no more than one man's opinion and, thus, philosophy became a forum of inexplicably [[Subjectivity|subjective]] rules and principles. The failure of the Enlightenment Project, because of the abandonment of a teleological structure, is shown by the inadequacy of moral [[emotivism]], which MacIntyre believes accurately reflects the state of modern morality.

MacIntyre offers a critique of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], whom he calls the "King Kamehameha II of the European tradition," in reference to the Polynesian allegory above.&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;{{rp|113}} MacIntyre explains that, "[[Nietzschean]] man, the [[Übermensch]], [is] the man who transcends, finds his good nowhere in the social world to date, but only that in himself which dictates his own new law and his own new table of the virtues."&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;{{rp|257}} Although he disagreed with Nietzsche's inegalitarian and elitist view of humankind, he acknowledged the validity of Nietzsche's critique of Enlightenment morality as an explanation of the latter's degeneration into [[emotivism]], and that, like Kamehameha II, Nietzsche had identified the moral imperatives of his time as arbitrary and incoherent in demanding their abolition. 

The nineteenth-century critic who has most lastingly and profoundly influenced MacIntyre is not Nietzsche but Marx—indeed, ''After Virtue'' originates in MacIntyre's plans to write a book repairing the moral weaknesses of [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;{{rp|ix–x}} His critique of [[capitalism]], and its associated [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideology and bureaucratic state (including what, in ''After Virtue'', he condemned as the [[state capitalism]] of the USSR) is not expressed in traditional Marxist terms. Instead, it is written as a defence of ordinary social "practices", and of the "goods internal to practices". Pursuit of these helps to give narrative structure and intelligibility to our lives, but these goods must be defended against their corruption by "institutions", which pursue such "external goods" as money, power and status (chapters 14-15).

MacIntyre seeks to find an alternative to Nietzsche's philosophy and eventually concludes that only classic Aristotelian thought can hope to save Western humanity. While Nietzsche seems to include the Aristotelian ethics and politics in his attack on the "degenerate disguises of the will to power,"&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;{{rp|127}} MacIntyre claims that this cannot be done due to important differences between the structure and assumptions of Aristotelian and post-Enlightenment philosophy. These include:
*Aristotle's assumption that man is as-he-happens-to-be and that this is distinct from man-as-he-should-be. The Enlightenment, on the other hand, offers no metaphysical framework whatsoever in place of teleology.
*Aristotle's claim that rules are based on virtues, which are derived from an understanding of the [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]. The Enlightenment reversed this and predicated virtues on an understanding of subjective (but purported to be universal) principles.
*Aristotle's assertion that virtue and morality are integral parts of society, as an understanding of the telos must be social and not individual. In the Enlightenment, however, societies lost their [[moral authority]] and the individual became the fundamental interpreter of moral questions.

MacIntyre opposes Nietzsche's return to the aristocratic ethics of [[Homeric]] Greece with the teleological approach to ethics pioneered by Aristotle. Nietzsche's critique of Enlightenment moral theory does not work against a [[teleological ethics]]. For MacIntyre, "Nietzsche replaces the fictions of the Enlightenment individualism, of which he is so contemptuous, with a set of individualist fictions of his own."&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;{{rp|129}}  Nietzsche's Uebermensch, his solution to the lies of the Enlightenment, exposes the failure of the Enlightenment's [[epistemological]] project and of its search for a subjective yet universal morality.  Nietzsche neglects the role of society in the formation and understanding of tradition and morality, and "Nietzsche's great man cannot enter into relationships mediated by appeal to shared standards or virtues or goods; he is his own only moral authority and his relationships to others have to be exercises of that authority... it will be to condemn oneself to that moral solipsism which constitutes Nietzschean greatness."&lt;ref name=AV/&gt;{{rp|258}}

''After Virtue'' ends by posing the question 'Nietzsche or Aristotle?', although MacIntyre acknowledges that the book does not give sufficient grounds for a definitive answer that it is Aristotle, not Nietzsche, who points to the best solution for the problems that the book has diagnosed. Those grounds are set out in MacIntyre's subsequent works, in which he elaborates a sophisticated revision of the philosophical tradition of [[Aristotelianism]].

In the end, however, MacIntyre tells us that we are waiting not for [[Waiting for Godot|Godot]] but for [[Benedict of Nursia]]. MacIntyre criticizes individualist political philosophy, such as [[John Rawls]]' ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' and [[Robert Nozick]]'s ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]''. To MacIntyre, morals and virtues can only be comprehended through their relation to the community in which they come from. Whereas Rawls tells us to conceive of justice through abstracting ourselves from who we are (through the veil of ignorance, for example) MacIntyre disagrees. Running throughout ''After Virtue'' is the belief that in order to comprehend who we are, we must understand where we come from.

==Reception==

[[George Scialabba]] found ''After Virtue'' to be a strong critique of modernity, but claimed that MacIntyre "faltered" at the conclusion of the argument, when he sketched the features of what virtuous life should be like in the conditions of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;George Scialabba's [http://www.georgescialabba.net/archive/000226.php review] of ''After Virtue''&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Scialabba objected to MacIntyre's claim that the good life for human beings consists in contemplating the good life for human beings; Scialabba found this insufficient and anticlimactic. Scialabba also argued that, although he appreciated MacIntyre's insistence on participation in community life as the best defense against the perils of modernity, this insistence was not justified with any discussion of how community life can be reconciled with the critical spirit that Scialabba finds to be one of the great achievements of modernity and of the philosophical enterprise.

In a review for ''Political Theory'', William E. Connolly argues that MacIntyre sees Nietzsche as "the adversary to be defeated, but Nietzsche's voice is not heard clearly". Connolly objects that MacIntyre's defense of virtue does not take into account Nietzsche's critique; MacIntyre also fails to build an account of ''telos'' that does not draw on biology in the way MacIntyre wanted to avoid—such a theory doesn't account for the fact that we are embodied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Connolly | first1 = W. E. | title = After Virtue | journal = Political Theory | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 315–319 | doi =  10.2307/190582| year = 1982 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Ellis, in the journal ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'', argued that MacIntyre's positive philosophical project is not explained as well as it could have been: it is "of daunting opacity, though tantalizingly interesting" but not given enough space in the book. Ellis also states that the discussion of Rawls and Nozick in ''After Virtue'' "is slight and assertive".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = A. | title = After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory | journal = Philosophy | volume = 57 | issue = 222 | pages = 551–553 | doi =  10.2307/4619611| year = 1982 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Review of Metaphysics]]'', Christos Evangeliou said that if the reader "had expected to find in this book concretely how a revived Aristotelian tradition is supposed to work in order to shape ethically and rationally the irrational and disorderly modern world", they "may be a little disappointed in their expectations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Evangeliou | first1 = C. | title = After Virtue | journal = The Review of Metaphysics | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 132–134 | doi =  10.2307/20127983| year = 1983 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Wheen]] included a brief critique of ''After Virtue'' in his own book ''How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World''. The thrust of Wheen's book was a defense of the principles of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] against various strands of [[irrationalism]], and Wheen identified ''After Virtue'' and MacIntyre as constituting one such strand. In general, critics{{Like whom?|date=November 2017}} identified Wheen's disparagement of MacIntyre as one of ''Mumbo-Jumbo''{{'s}} few missteps. While MacIntyre certainly is a fierce critic of the Enlightenment, Wheen refused to engage MacIntyre's case but dismissed his work on the grounds that any objection to the Enlightenment qualified as "mumbo-jumbo" ''ex hypothesi''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59099-2004Jun21.html footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14140">A '''nebular opposition''' (also '''binary system''') is a pair of related terms or concepts that are opposite in meaning. Binary opposition is the system by which language and thought, two theoretical opposites are strictly defined and set off against one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=G. |year=1996 |title=Binary opposition and sexual power in Paradise Lost |journal=Midwest Quarterly |volume=27 |issue=4 |page=383 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the contrast between two mutually exclusive terms, such as on and off, up and down, left and right.&lt;ref name="Baldick"/&gt; Binary opposition is an important concept of structuralism, which sees such distinctions as fundamental to all language and thought.&lt;ref name="Baldick"&gt;Baldick, C 2004. The concise Oxford Dictionary of literary terms, viewed 8 March 2011, http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1056-binaryopposition.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[structuralism]], a binary opposition is seen as a fundamental organizer of human philosophy, culture, and language.

Binary opposition originated in Saussurean structuralist theory.&lt;ref name="Fogarty"&gt;Fogarty, S 2005, The literary encyclopedia, viewed 6 March 2011, http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?pec=true&amp;UID=122&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], the binary opposition is the means by which the units of language have value or meaning; each unit is defined in reciprocal determination with another term, as in binary code. It is not a contradictory relation but a structural, complementary one.&lt;ref name="Fogarty"/&gt; Saussure demonstrated that a sign's meaning is derived from its context (syntagmatic dimension) and the group (paradigm) to which it belongs.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, N 2000, Narrative and Genre, p.64, Palgrave, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is that one cannot conceive of 'good' if we do not understand 'evil'.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, N 2000, Narrative and Genre, p. 65, Palgrave, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, one of the two opposites assumes a role of dominance over the other. The categorization of binary oppositions is "often value-laden and ethnocentric", with an illusory order and superficial meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goody|1977|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Pieter Fourie discovered that binary oppositions have a deeper or second level of binaries that help to reinforce meaning. As an example, the concepts ''hero'' and ''villain'' involve secondary binaries: good/bad, handsome/ugly, liked/disliked, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fourie|first=Pieter|title=Media Studies Volume 2: Content, Audiences and Production|year=2001|publisher=Juta Education|location=Lansdowne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of binaries in Western thought==
A classic example of a binary opposition is the presence-absence dichotomy. In much of Western thought, including [[structuralism]], distinguishing between presence and absence, viewed as polar opposites, is a fundamental element of thought in many cultures. In addition, according to post-structuralist criticisms, ''presence'' occupies a position of dominance in Western thought over ''absence'', because ''absence'' is traditionally seen as what you get when you take away ''presence''. (Had ''absence'' been dominant, ''presence'' might have most naturally been seen as what you get when you take away an ''absence''.) &lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2011, Binary opposition, viewed 9 March 2011, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/65552/binary-opposition&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nasser Maleki, there is another example of this phenomenon whereby people value one part of a binary opposition over another; “we, as living in a certain culture, think and act similarly in situations when we want to pick out one of the concepts in the binary oppositions or while seeking truth or a center. For example, we give superiority to life rather than death.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maleki|first1=Nasser|title=Contextualising Kathleen Raine's selected poems in the light of Derridean midel of deconstruction|journal=Journal of Language and Literature|volume=5|issue=2|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the cultural setting a reader is a part of may influence their interpretation of a work of literature; “only one concept, from the binary opposition, is ready, in our mind, to be privileged and the other one is usually put aside as having the second priority.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maleki|first1=Nesser|title=Contextualising Kathleen Raine's selected poems in the light of Derridean model of deconstruction|journal=Journal of Language and Literature|volume=5|issue=2|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reached this conclusion by giving a name to the shared western unconsciousness for a preferred binary concept - [[logocentrism]]. This is the belief that “an ultimate reality or centre of truth exists and that can serve as the basis for all our thought and actions. This might imply that readers might unconsciously take side with one concept of binary opposition, and Derrida traces this reaction as a cultural phenomenon.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maleki|first1=Nesser|title=5. Contextualising Kathleen Raine's selected poems in the light of Derridean model of deconstruction|journal=Journal of Language and Literature|volume=5|issue=2|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jacques Derrida]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derrida |first=Jacques |year=1992 |title=Positions |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning in the West is defined in terms of binary oppositions, “a violent hierarchy” where “one of the two terms governs the other.” Within the white/ black binary opposition in the United States, the African American is defined as a devalued other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hogue |first=W. |year=2008 |title=Radical democracy, African American subjectivity and John Edgar Wideman's Philadelphia Fire |journal=Melus |volume=33 |issue=3 |page=48 |doi=10.1093/melus/33.3.45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a binary opposition is the male-female dichotomy. A post-structuralist view is that ''male'' can be seen, according to traditional Western thought, as dominant over ''female'' because ''male'' is the presence of a phallus, while the vagina is an absence or loss. John Searle has suggested that the concept of binary oppositions—as taught and practiced by postmodernists and poststructuralist—is specious and lacking in rigor.&lt;ref&gt;In [http://free--expression.blogspot.com/2007/10/john-searle-on-derrida.html 1983], American philosopher [[John Searle]] reviewed Johnathan Culler's ''On Deconstruction: Theory and Criticism after Structuralism'' for the [[New York Review of Books]], writing,
:"In Culler's book, we get the following examples of knowledge and mastery [attained from analysis of binary opposites and deconstruction]: speech is a form of writing (passim), presence is a certain type of absence (p. 106), the marginal is in fact central (p. 140), the literal is metaphorical (p. 148), truth is a kind of fiction (p. 181), reading is a form of misreading (p. 176), understanding is a form of misunderstanding (p. 176), sanity is a kind of neurosis (p. 160), and man is a form of woman (p. 171). Some readers may feel that such a list generates not so much feelings of mastery as of monotony. There is in deconstructive writing a constant straining of the prose to attain something that sounds profound by giving it the air of a [[paradox]], e.g., "truths are fictions whose fictionality has been forgotten" (p. 181).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deconstruction of Western binaries==
The political (rather than analytic or conceptual) critique of binary oppositions is an important part of [[third wave feminism]], [[post-colonialism]], [[post-anarchism]], and [[critical race theory]], which argue that the perceived binary dichotomy between man/woman, civilized/uncivilised, and white/black have perpetuated and legitimized Western power structures favoring "civilized white men." In the last fifteen years it has become routine for many social and/or historical analyses to address the variables of gender, class, sexuality, race and ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Dunk"&gt;Dunk, T 1997, 'White guys: studies in post-modern domination and difference', Labour, vol. 40, p. 306, (online Infotrac).&lt;/ref&gt; Within each of these categories there is usually an unequal binary opposition: bourgeoisie/working class man; white/people of colour; men/women; heterosexual/homosexual.&lt;ref name="Dunk"/&gt;

[[Post-structuralism|Post-structural]] criticism of binary oppositions is not simply the reversal of the opposition, but its [[deconstruction]], which is described as apolitical&amp;mdash;that is, not intrinsically favoring one arm of a binary opposition over the other. Deconstruction is the "event" or "moment" at which a binary opposition is thought to contradict itself, and undermine its own authority.&lt;ref&gt;"One sometimes gets the impression that deconstruction is a kind of game that anyone can play. One could, for example, invent a deconstruction of deconstructionism as follows: In the hierarchical opposition, deconstruction/logocentrism (phono-phallo-logocentrism), the privileged term "deconstruction" is in fact subordinate to the devalued term "logocentrism," for, in order to establish the hierarchical superiority of deconstruction, the deconstructionist is forced to attempt to represent its superiority, its axiological primacy, by argument and persuasion, by appealing to the logocentric values he tries to devalue. But his efforts to do this are doomed to failure because of the internal inconsistency in the concept of deconstructionism itself, because of its very self-referential dependence on the authority of a prior logic. By an [[aporetical]] [[Aufhebung]], deconstruction deconstructs itself." Searle, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deconstruction assumes that all binary oppositions need to be analyzed and criticized in all their manifestations; the function of both logical and [[axiological]] oppositions must be studied in all [[discourse]]s that provide meaning and values. But deconstruction does not only expose how oppositions work and how meaning and values are produced in a [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] or [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]] position, "thereby preventing any means of intervening in the field effectively". To be effective, and simply as its mode of practice, deconstruction creates new notions or concepts, not to synthesize the terms in opposition but to mark their difference, undecidability, and eternal interplay.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Jacques Derrida,  “Positions” (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 41-43&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relation to logocentrism==
Logocentrism is an idea related to binary opposition that suggests certain audiences will favour one part of a binary opposition pair over the other. This favouritism is often most strongly influenced by a readers' cultural background. The strong patriarchal themes in 'The Women and the Pot', an Amharic folktale, would be one such example of logocentrism.  This tells the story of two women who are upset at their diminished role in society, and who consequently go to their King for help. He effectively conveys the message that women cannot be relied upon to take on a greater role in society, which becomes the moral of the tale. Prasad explains this idea; “The logocentric value is seen through the 'Eternal Knowledge' – the naturalness of male superiority – that is conveyed through the folktale. The hidden a priori binary opposition is 'Man over Woman'.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prasad|first1=A|title=8. Logocentrism and a priori Binary Opposition vis-a-vis Women. Politics in Ethiopia Folktales- A Study of Selected Ethiopian Folktales|journal=Fabula|volume=48|issue=1–2|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the cultural heritage of an audience having an influence on their unconscious preference for one part of a binary opposition, Prasad says; “By way of studying a selection of Ethiopian folktales, the paper uncovers the presence of logocentrism and a priori binary opposition being at work in Ethiopian folktales. These two elements attempt to endorse and validate the 'given' subservient position of women in society”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prasad|first1=A|title=8. Logocentrism and a priori Binary Opposition vis-a-vis Women. Politics in Ethiopia Folktales- A Study of Selected Ethiopian Folktales|journal=Fabula|volume=48|issue=1–2|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
Binary opposition is deeply embedded within literature as language, and paired opposites, rely upon a relation with adjoining words inside a paradigmatic chain. If one of the paired opposites were removed the other’s precise meaning would be altered.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, P., 2009. ''Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory''. 3rd ed. New York, USA: Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, binary opposition was explored in children’s literature and it was found that authors were reinforcing Westernized images and philosophies of feminism via the binary hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai, K. 2013. pp. 141 - 147"&gt;Varga-Dobai, K., 2013. Gender Issues in Multicultural Children's Literature - Black and Third-World Feminist Critiques of Appropriation, Essentialism, and Us/Other Binary Oppositions. Multicultural Perspectives, 15(3), pp. 141–147.&lt;/ref&gt; Western authors were creating a representation of non-Western countries based on colonial discourse, using binary oppositions to categorize human behaviour into one term or another – not both. The non-Western woman, therefore, was “the opposite or ‘other’ to women and girls from the West”.&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai, K. 2013. pp. 141 - 147"/&gt;

'''Body image''' is a person's perception of the [[aesthetics]] or [[sexual attractiveness]] of their own body. It involves how a person sees themselves according to the standards that have been set by society. The Austrian [[neurologist]] and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Paul Schilder]] coined the phrase ''body-image'' in his book ''The Image and Appearance of the Human Body'' (1935).&lt;ref name="Schilder1999"&gt;{{cite book|last= Schilder|first= Paul |authorlink= Paul Schilder|title= The Image and Appearance of the Human Body: Studies in the Constructive Energies of the Psyche|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L2CNWxKdWhMC&amp;pg=PA17|year= 1999|publisher= Psychology Press|isbn= 978-0-415-21081-2|orig-year= 1935|p=11 | quote = The body schema is the tri-dimensional image everyone has about himself. We may call it 'body-image'.}} This work translates and expands Schilder's 1923 work: {{cite book

[[Human society]] has at all times placed great value on beauty of the human body, but a person's perception of their own body may not correspond to society's standards.

The concept of body image is used in a number of disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[psychiatry]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[philosophy]] and [[Cultural studies|cultural]] and [[feminist studies]]; the media also often uses the term . Across these disciplines and media there is no consensus definition, but body image may be expressed as how people view themselves in the mirror, or in their minds. It incorporates the memories, experiences, assumptions, and comparisons of one's own appearance, and overall attitudes towards one's height, shape, and weight.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-body-image|title= What is Body Image?|publisher= National Eating Disorders Association|access-date= 2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's impression of their body is also assumed{{by whom|date=October 2018}} to be a product of ideals cultivated by various social and cultural ideals.

The issues surrounding body image can be examined through body negativity and through [[body positivity]]. Negative body image consists of a disoriented view of one's shape; whereby one may often feel self-conscious or feel ashamed, and assume others are more attractive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Aside from having low [[Self-Esteem, Self-Love|self-esteem]], sufferers typically fixate on altering their physical appearances. Long-term behavior could thus potentially lead to higher risks of [[eating disorders]], isolation, and [[mental illnesses]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Having a negative body-image may lead to a more serious mental illness such as [[body dysmorphic disorder]]: "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), occasionally still called dysmorphophobia, is a mental disorder characterized by the obsessive idea that some aspect of one's own body part or appearance is severely flawed and warrants exceptional measures to hide or fix their [[Body dysmorphic disorder|dysmorphic]] part on their person..."{{Better source|reason= per WP:CIRCULAR|date= May 2018}}
Positive body image on the other hand, is described as a clear true perception of one's figure. In addition to celebrating and appreciating the body, it also requires an understanding that an individual's appearance does not reflect their character or self-worth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2007 report by the [[American Psychological Association]] found that a culture-wide [[sexualization]] of girls and women was contributing to increased female [[anxiety]] associated with body image.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web |title= Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls |year= 2007 |format = PDF |publisher= American Psychological Association |url= http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Australian government]] [[Australian Senate committees|Senate Standing Committee]] report on the [[sexualization of children]] in the media reported similar findings associated with body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Environment_and_Communications/Completed_inquiries/2008-10/sexualisationofchildren/report/index|title= Sexualisation of children in the contemporary media|date= June 26, 2008|publisher= Parliament of Australia |access-date= 2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}}  However, other scholars have expressed concern that these claims are not based on solid data.&lt;ref name="tamiu"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Ferguson |first= C. |author2= Winegard, B. |author3= Winegard, B.M. |title= Who is the fairest one of all: How evolution guides peer and media influences on female body dissatisfaction |journal= Review of General Psychology |date= March 2011 |volume= 15 |issue= 1 |pages= 11–28 |url= http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Who%20Is%20the%20Fairest.pdf |doi= 10.1037/a0022607 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/65q5xHqLw?url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Who%20Is%20the%20Fairest.pdf |archivedate= 2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Body image can have a wide range of psychological effects and physical effects. Throughout history, it has been extremely difficult for people to live up to the standards of society and what they believe the ideal body is.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Many factors contribute to a person's body image; some of these include: family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for [[obesity]] or [[malnutrition]], and cultural expectations (e.g., [[Media depictions of body shape|media]] and politics). People who are either underweight or overweight can have poor body image. However, when people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned about the risks of obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor body image. This is something that can lead to a change in a person's body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Derenne|first= J. L.,|author2= Beresin E. V.|title= Body image, media, and eating disorders|journal= Academic Psychiatry|year= 2006|issue= 30|pages= 257–261|url= http://ap.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=50181|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130415161703/http://ap.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=50181|archivedate= 2013-04-15|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, people who have a low body image will try to alter their bodies in some way, such as by [[dieting]] or by undergoing [[cosmetic surgery]].

Society often constructs our behaviors and beliefs, such as personal developments, physiological and psychological interactions, and the common "perception of our bodies as a reflection of self worth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://livelifegetactive.com/blog/body-image-self-esteem|title=Body image, self-esteem and the influence of society|date=2016-08-01|publisher=Live Life Get Active|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body image struggles have been prevalent for many centuries now, especially with the rapid constant shifts in ideal body types. In the past, norms were typically set by cultural beliefs, genders, or social standings. Despite these being prevalent today, changes in the fashion and media industries are other influences at hand.

During [[Ancient Egyptian]] times, the perfect woman was said to have a slender figure, with narrow shoulders, and a tall waist. Yet, females were emboldened in their beauty habits and general independence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rehabs.com/explore/womens-body-image-and-bmi/|title=Women's Body Image and BMI: 100 Years in the US|publisher=rehabs.com|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standards were reformed in [[Ancient Greece]], when society began worshipping the male figure instead. As men faced greater pressures on beauty and perfection, women sported a fuller and plump figure, with fair skin tones becoming more popular.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The pale skin craze was soon adopted in the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]], but waist sizes narrowed. Overall figures shrunk, as the Chinese associated petite with [[femininity]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

With the need to reflect her husband's status, the behaviors and outward appearances of the wife grew incredible crucial during the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Since size was linked to wealth, women maintained bodies with full hips and an ample bosom.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]] witnessed a similar movement, but the popularity of the corset cinching the waist, led to the desirable hourglass figure.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The era also introduced the [[Gibson Girl]], which was the first sign of influence by the fashion and media industries. Created by [[Charles Gibson]], he envisioned femininity as slim and tall, with large busts and wide hips, but a narrow waist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/05/perfect-body-change-beauty-ideals_n_4733378.html|title=It's Amazing How Much The 'Perfect Body' Has Changed In 100 Years|last=Bahadur|first=Nina|date=2014-02-06|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These girls were also often shown in magazines such as ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]'', which resulted in a link between trendy fashions and styles, and the maintenance of active lifestyles and healthy well-beings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://greatist.com/grow/100-years-womens-body-image|title=See How Much the "Perfect" Female Body Has Changed in 100 Years (It's Crazy!)|date=2015-01-15|publisher=Greatist|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], the Gibson Girl transformed into the [[Flapper]], which dominated the period of the "[[Roaring Twenties]]". Women transitioned towards [[Androgyny|androgynous]] looks, whereby hairstyles were kept short, and wore brassieres that flatten the chest.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/05/perfect-body-change-beauty-ideals_n_4733378.html|title=It's Amazing How Much The 'Perfect Body' Has Changed In 100 Years|last=Bahadur|first=Nina|date=2014-02-06|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loose clothing was also a trend, as it downplayed the waist by lowering it below the navel, resulting in a straight boyish figure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://greatist.com/grow/100-years-womens-body-image|title=See How Much the "Perfect" Female Body Has Changed in 100 Years (It's Crazy!)|date=2015-01-15|publisher=Greatist|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dress senses become more casual as well, and is said to have been a representation of the reduction in social or political tension after the war, or an extensive disagreement with the matron like image of the women behind the alcohol [[Prohibition]] movement in the USA.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scienceofpeople.com/ideal-body-types-throughout-history/|title=A Look Back at Beauty Through History|date=2016-05-10|publisher=Science of People|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With advertisements increasingly advocating the need to achieve a thinner frame, many women therefore pursued diets and exercises.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Although slimmer body types were favoured, a sporty and healthy appearance was still prized above the frail and sickly look from the Victorian Era.

The 1930s and 1940s witnessed the devastating effects of the [[World War II|2nd World War]]. While men were out on the battlefield, females began entering the workforce. This resulted in more formal and traditional military dress styles for women, which caused another shift in body image. While waists remained thin but prominent, the media embraced a more curvaceous look similar to the [[hourglass figure]], through the addition of broad shoulders and large breasts as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Since this era was part of the [[Hollywood Golden Age|golden age of Hollywood]], many celebrities continued to influence this trend by wearing tight fitted clothing that emphasized their figures. [[Pin-up girls]] and sex symbols radiating glamour soon followed in the 1950s, and the proportions of the hourglass figure expanded. Notable names include [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Sophia Loren]], and [[Jessica Rabbit]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In order to achieve this ideal figure, women consumed weight-gain supplements.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Should Body-Shaming Ads Be Banned |magazine=Scholastic Choices |date=November–December 2016 |url=https://choices.scholastic.com/issues/2016-17/110116/should-body-shaming-ads-be-banned.html |pages=32(3), 2–5}}&lt;!-- Was book ref lacking URL; have I got the right ref? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The release of [[Playboy|''Playboy'' magazine]] and the [[Barbie|''Barbie'' doll]] during this era were other additions in the need to achieve this ideal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Depictions of the perfect woman slowly grew thinner from 1960s onwards. The "[[Swinging Sixties]]" saw a similar look to the Flapper&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; with the emergence of high-fashion model [[Twiggy]], who promoted the thin and petite frame, with long slender legs,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and an adolescent but androgynous figure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other characteristics include, small busts, narrow hips, and flat stomachs. Many women either underwent diets or switched to weight-loss supplements to achieve the new look.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This eventually resulted in an increase in [[anorexia nervosa]] sufferers during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Greater importance was soon placed on fitness. Actress [[Farrah Fawcett]] introduced a more toned and athletic body type.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The exercise craze continued in the 1980s with [[Jane Fonda]] and the release of workout videos, motivating women to be thin but fit and svelte.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This era also saw the rise of tall, long legged supermodels; such as [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Cindy Crawford]], dominating the industry, and setting a new beauty standard for females around the world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Greater issues arose in the 1990s, when supermodel [[Kate Moss]] popularized the stick-thin figure instead. The fashion industry pushed her image further with the 'heroin-chic' look, which dominated the [[catwalks]] during that time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This was communicated through waifish appearances, bony structures, thin limbs, and an androgynous figure.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Although this extreme period was only short-lived, the 2000s saw the rise of the [[Victoria's Secret]] models, who altered beauty norms to include slim but healthy figures, with large breasts and bottoms, flat and visible abs, and prominent [[thigh gap]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

More women pursued cosmetic surgery practices, on top of diets and exercise regimes, to attain the perfect appearance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As of 2017, positive measures are being taken to promote a better body image such as the emergence of fitness trends and plus-size models in the fashion and media industries. However, the advancement of technologies and pressures from the media have led to even greater importance being placed on the way we look as an indication of our personal value.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

On account of the evolution of society today; [[text messaging]], [[e-mails]], [[social media]], and other technological advancements have dominated an individual's sequence of physical interactions. Although technology provides the convenience of connecting with others, its association with the media has resulted in a "platform of delivery in which we intercept and interpret messages about ourselves, our self-worth, and our bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/information/eating-disorder/body-image-technology|title=How Technology Influences Body Image |publisher=Eating Disorder Hope |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by ''[[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]]'', only 4% of women thought they were beautiful,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=Cindy |title=Sex, College, and Social Media: A Commonsense Guide to Navigating the Hookup Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZicxDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-81858-2|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; while approximately 70% of women and girls in the UK believed the media's portrayal of impractical beauty standards fueled their appearance anxieties.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/dove-global-body-image-report_uk_5762a6a1e4b0681487dcc470|title=Dove's Largest Ever Body Image Report Proves The Media Needs To Up Its Game|date=2016-06-21|publisher=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the ''[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]'' reported that, 91% of women were mostly unhappy with their bodies,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/body-image-statistics/|title=Body Image Statistics|date=2017-02-19|publisher=Statistic Brain|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 40% will consider cosmetic surgery to fix their flaws.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Women "all over the world are evaluated and oppressed by their appearances";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/30205/1/how-should-we-tackle-fashion-s-body-image-issues|title=How should we tackle fashion's body image issues? |date=2016-03-04|publisher=Dazed|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; be it [[Ageism|age]], [[Colorism|skin tone]], or [[Anti-fat bias|size]]. A large facet of "[[social currency]] for girls and women continues to be rooted in physical appearance".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; With accessories and apparel designed to enhance a look, social media, magazines, and marketing campaigns and advertisements also add to the burden of perfection. This is still prevalent today, whereby female bodies are staged as the ultimate [[Commodification|commodity]], and used for the selling of products.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web | title = how the fashion industry affects the bodies of young women | last = Mair | first = Avril | publisher = i-D | date = November 21, 2014 | accessdate = 2017-11-16 | url = https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/9kybkv/how-the-fashion-industry-affects-the-bodies-of-young-women | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate purpose of many advertisements is thus to appeal to the insecurities of individuals, in hopes of selling them the solution. Marketers fueling negative body imagery are also highly aware that those who undergo these problems are more likely to purchase their products. For that reason, advertisements regularly advocate the ability to achieve a particular look through retouched images, the sexual objectification of women, and products accompanied with explicit messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|title=Advertising Sets Impossible Standards for Women|publisher=The Balance|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many advertisements today display an image of the 'perfect' woman with an idealistic body and flawless facial features. This ideal woman creates an unrealistic image for women and puts pressure on them to live up to that certain standard. According to [[Naomi Wolf]] "our culture disempowers women by holding them prisoner to an unattainable beauty ideal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Eating Disorders and the Role of the Media|last1=Spettigue|first1=Wendy|first2= Katherine A. |last2=Henderson|pmc=2533817|journal=The Canadian Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Review|date=February 2004 |volume=13|issue=1|pp=16–19|pmid=19030149}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reference various researcher's experiments in this field and the results that were found. For example, they refer to Hargreaves &amp; Tiggemann (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hargreaves|first=Duane|date=|title=Longer-term implications of responsiveness to 'thin-ideal' television: support for a cumulative hypothesis of body image disturbance?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/erv.509/full|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=11|pages=465–477|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/erv.509|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they look at how exposure to television adverts that contain women of a thin-ideal effects the body image of the women watching them. They found that the exposure led to an increase in body dissatisfaction.

The need for body satisfaction and appearance esteem continues to increase with the abundance of [[billboards]], magazines, and conversations displaying "unrealistic images of beauty" (LiveLifeGetActive, 2016). Weight prejudices brought up in the media or social settings are also prevalent within society. The tendency to link physical attractive qualities with positive personal qualities has been documented since the 1970s. People assign positive personality traits and overall life outcomes to those they perceive as attractive both mentally and physically. The very thin and beautiful models within the media are therefore seen as the most successful and socially desirable people on the planet''.[[Body image#cite note-9|&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

In most societies, thinness is typically associated with happiness, success, youthfulness, and social acceptability. This ideal is heavily portrayed throughout the [[mainstream media]], whereby women are assumed to be perfect in every way. In addition, the idea that a person can never be too thin or too rich, makes it difficult for females to attain any sort of happiness about their personal appearance.[[Body image#cite note-12|&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Hence, a women's attitude towards her body are thus a result of comparing it with those depicted in the media, along with society's obsession with thinness.  A study was done by Rachel Cohen in 2015 to investigate if [[Facebook]] impacted the number of women experiencing body dissatisfaction, 'Since social media forums such as Facebook involve one's peers, the current study aimed to determine whether the relationship between appearance comparison and body image dissatisfaction would be stronger for those exposed to social media images, compared to conventional media images'

Body dissatisfaction creates negative attitudes, a [[The Thin Ideal|damaging mentality,]] and negative habits in young, adult females.

Global eating disorder rates such as anorexia and [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] are gradually rising in adolescent girls. The ''[[National Eating Disorders Association]]'', reported that 95% of individuals who suffer from an eating disorder are aged 12 to 26,&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.imperosoftware.com/uk/blog/national-eating-disorder-awareness-week-nedaw-what-you-need-to-know/|title=National Eating Disorder Awareness Week (NEDAW) {{!}} Impero|date=2016-02-22|publisher=Impero UK|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anorexia is the third most common illness among teenagers.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Based on another study by ''Dove'', 87% of individuals with low body-esteems often avoid eating, and would rather place their health at risk for the sake of beauty. With the habitual use of social media, teenage girls in particular, are most prone "to internalize negative messages and obsess about weight loss to obtain a thin appearance".&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rawhide.org/blog/infographics/body-image-issues/|title=Body Image Issues: The Teen Male Edition [Infographic]|date=2016-04-26|publisher=Rawhide|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, pressures from social media doubles for adolescent girls between the ages of 13 to 18 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghanavisions.com/news/world/86458-if-i-don-t-get-40-likes-on-my-selfies-my-self-esteem-plummets-the-truth-about-how-social-media-affects-teenage-girls-that-every-mother-needs-to-read-now%C2%A0.html|title='If I don't get 40 likes on my selfies my self esteem plummets': The truth about how social media affects teenage girls that EVERY mother needs to read now|publisher=Ghana Visions |access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than half of have already reported the need to diet. The pressure on females "to cope with the effects of culturally induced body insecurity" is therefore severe,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; with many others previously citing that "their lives would be better if they were not judged by their looks and body shape, [as] this is leading to low self-esteem, eating disorders, mental health problems and depression."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/06/body-image-concerns-men-more-than-women|title=Body image concerns more men than women, research finds|last=Campbell|first=Denis|date=2012-01-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the need to be thin and young, there is also a weight prejudice within our society that is brought up in media, social settings, with friends, or even by parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Triplett|first= L|date= May 23, 2007|title= The Blame Game: A first glimpse at the socially acceptable causes of female fatness|postscript=.

Even the average size of clothing women wear has changed drastically within the past decades, as a size 8 used to be considered small to average and is now nearly plus size. Actress/comedian [[Amy Schumer]] spoke out on the issue of size when she was featured in [[Glamour Magazine]] as a "Plus Size Woman".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/05/entertainment/amy-schumer-glamour-body-shaming-feat/index.html|title=Amy Schumer to Glamour: I'm not plus-size|last=CNN|first=Lisa Respers France|publisher=CNN|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the magazines publication, Schumer posted a [[Twitter|tweet]] saying, "I think there's nothing wrong with being plus size. Beautiful healthy women. Plus size is considered size 16 in America. I go between a size 6 and a 8."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Women who value this idea of having to be extremely thin and a size 2 or 4 have body dissatisfaction, and take part in cosmetic surgeries or weight loss behaviors (such as dieting) to try to become the standard that they so commonly see.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The problem in which people, specifically women, are constantly comparing themselves to the people and images in the media leads to individuals believing they are more overweight than they actually are.&lt;ref&gt;Brodie, D., Slade, P., &amp; Riley, V. (1991). Sex differences in body image perceptions. 	Perceptual and Motor Skills, 72(1), 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; unattainable. "Idealised media images are routinely subjected to computer manipulation techniques, such as airbrushing (e.g. slimming thighs and increasing muscle tone). The resulting images present an unobtainable 'aesthetic perfection' that has no basis in biological reality" Paraskeva et al. (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paraskeva|first=Nicole|date=|title=Consumer opinion on social policy approaches to promoting positive body image: Airbrushed media images and disclaimer labels|url=|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|volume=22|pages=164–175|via=sage Journals|doi=10.1177/1359105315597052|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other researchers have contested the claims of the media effects paradigm. An article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard, for example, argues that peer effects are much more likely to cause body dissatisfaction than media effects, and that media effects have been overemphasized.&lt;ref name="tamiu" /&gt; It also argues that one must be careful about making the leap from arguing that certain environmental conditions might cause body dissatisfaction to the claim that those conditions can cause diagnosable eating disorders.

Women are constantly exposed to the retouched bodies of celebrities, which reflect society's ideal thin body in the media. This leads to the women developing poor self-images. Women begin to see the thin ideal body, which they see constantly in the media, as the perfect body that they should aim to achieve.&lt;ref name="GrabeWard2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grabe|first1=Shelly|last2=Ward|first2=L.

=== Men ===
Males also face similar burdens in regards to attractiveness, whereby the media's depiction of the ideal muscular physique has caused numerous body dissatisfaction issues among young men. Teenage boys in particular, are now three times more likely to suffer from [[Body dysmorphic disorder|Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)]], with numbers reaching 45% since 1991.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; BDD is a mental illness whereby an individual compulsively focuses on physical self-perceived flaws.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; According to a study by Rawhide, 18% of adolescent males were most worried about their weight and physique (Malcore, 2016), while 29% frequently thought about their appearances.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Moreover, 50% had recently complained about the way they look.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

The main causes of male body issues include 25% being teased about their weight,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 33% specified social media as the source for self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; A factor that affects male body image on social media sites is "celebrity involvement". Following celebrities on social media sites makes it possible to interact personally with celebrities, which has been shown to influence male body image.&lt;ref name="HoLee2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Shirley S.|last2=Lee|first2=Edmund W.

Men may also suffer from the mental disorder bigorexia, also known as [[muscle dysmorphia]]. Sufferers of bigorexia tend to constantly chase their ideal muscular body. However, many sufferers never attain this ideal body due to never being fully satisfied with their physique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosley|first=Philip E.|date=2009-05-01|title=Bigorexia: bodybuilding and muscle dysmorphia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/erv.897/abstract|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=17|issue=3|pages=191–198|doi=10.1002/erv.897|issn=1099-0968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While women face expectations to be increasingly thin, endorsements featuring the muscular ideal therefore causes numerous problems for men. Granting both genders may share the idealised image of narrow waists and hips, other characteristics specific to the mesomorphic and muscular V-shaped body, include broad shoulders, a well-developed upper body, [and] toned six-pack abs.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The importance men placed on muscle and weight may be traced back to the release of G.I. Joe. The "bulked-up action heroes, along with the brawny characters in many video games, present an anatomically impossible ideal for boys, much as Barbie promotes proportions that are physically impossible for girls."&lt;ref name="Adams2014"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/17/body-image-boys_n_5637975.html|title=It's Not Just Girls. Boys Struggle With Body Image, Too.|last=Adams|first=Rebecca|date=2014-09-17|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are thus exposed to extensive imaging of men with bulging muscles, who often act as warriors or fighters, solving problems with their fists. By watching their heroes fight and punch, boys learn that aggression is essential and that they should strive to have huge muscles too. If these role models were smiling, less hyper-masculinized, or less aggressive, boys would not learn from such a young age that hyper-masculinity is the only successful way to be a 'man'.&lt;ref name="Adams2014" /&gt; A new term named 'Fitspiration' has even come into play over recent years. 'Fitspiration,' a term that combines "fitness" and "inspiration", is an online trend designed to inspire viewers towards a healthier lifestyle by promoting exercise and healthy food'.&lt;ref name="TiggemannZaccardo2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tiggemann|first1=Marika|last2=Zaccardo|first2=Mia|title="Exercise to be fit, not skinny": The effect of fitspiration imagery on women's body image|journal=Body Image|volume=15|year=2015|pages=61–67|issn=1740-1445|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2015.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular slogan of 'Fitspiration' photos is "Strong is the New Skinny", an expression that encourages people to not be afraid of getting strong and working out.&lt;ref name="Tiggemann"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiggemann|first=Marika|last2=Zaccardo|first2=Mia|date=2016-03-31|title='Strong is the new skinny': A content analysis of #fitspiration images on Instagram|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359105316639436|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|doi=10.1177/1359105316639436|page=135910531663943}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of a desire to achieve a good body and healthy lifestyle has increased in the last decade due to fitness accounts of Facebook and [[Instagram]]. Although 'Fitspiration' accounts and pictures have the intention of motivating people to pursue healthy lifestyles, they oftentimes contain objectifying elements or only show a certain body type, which can negatively affect many women's body images. For instance, 'Fitspiration' images tend to focus on specific poses or features of a woman such as washboard abs, which in turn objectifies the person.&lt;ref name="Tiggemann"/&gt;

Regardless of the lower number of products targeting males, negative messages can be communicated through fitness websites, video games, pop culture, movies, and other types of media as well. Based on a report by the Picture of Health, 53% of boys cited advertisements as a "major source of pressure to look good; [though] social media (57%) and friends (68%) exerted more influence, while celebrities (49%) were slightly less persuasive".&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.warc.com/NewsAndOpinion/News/Ads_add_to_boys_bodyimage_pressure/37212|title=Ads add to boys' body-image pressure |publisher=WARC |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, 22% of adolescent boys thought that the ideals depicted by the media were aspirational, while 33% cited it was healthy.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

With rising pressures to achieve a muscular physique, many teenage boys thus participate in extreme workouts and weight trainings for long periods of the day. Some eventually abuse supplements and steroids to further increase muscle mass. In 2016, 10.5% acknowledged the use of muscle-enhancing substances,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 5 to 6% of respondents admitted to the use of steroids.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Although dieting is often overlooked, a significant increase in eating disorders is present among men. Currently, 1 out of 4 men suffer from eating disorders,&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; while 31% have admitted to [[Purging disorder|purging]] or [[binge eating]] in the past.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

== The fashion industry ==
The [[fashion industry]] is a prime target of body image issues, with models often facing second-hand criticism. Fashion industry insiders believe that clothes hang better on tall, thin women; however, critics argue that catwalk models communicate an unhealthy and unrealistic body image to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41174739|title=Dior and Gucci ban super-skinny models|date=2017-09-06|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the world of fashion, it often seems as if measurements, or the number or alphabet carried defines an individual. Based on a survey participated by 13 to 17 year olds in the U.S., 90% "felt pressured by fashion and media industries to be skinny",&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teens, Social Media And Body Image|last=Gallivan|first=H|publisher=Park Nicollet Melrose Cente|year=2014|isbn=|location=MN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 65% believing that the body image portrayed were too thin.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; Furthermore, more than 60% habitually compare themselves to models,&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; while 46% will strive to achieve it.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; The underlying issue with brands featuring underweight models, therefore revolves around expressing "the message that an unhealthy body type is the most socially valued".&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.health.com/anorexia/underweight-models-french-fashion-brands|title=French Fashion Brands Are Refusing to Hire Models Under Size 2. Here's Why That's So Important|publisher=Health.com|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For eating disorders sufferers, viewing these images could consequently strengthen desires to lose weight.

The severity of this matter continues to rise as fashion magazines directed at females, subtly promote thinness and diet practices, and are heavily relied on by teenagers for beauty and fashion advice. [[Seventeen (American magazine)|''Seventeen'' magazine]] in particular recorded one of the highest number of articles devoted to appearances, leading to 69% of girls stating it influenced their ideal body shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthyplace.com/eating-disorders/articles/eating-disorders-body-image-and-advertising/|title=Eating Disorders: Body Image and Advertising |publisher=HealthyPlace|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 50% of advertisements featured also used beauty appeal to sell products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://infographiclist.com/2012/05/18/body-culture-how-media-shapes-our-thoughts-and-ideas-about-beauty-eating-and-image-infographic/|title=Body Culture: How Media Shapes Our Thoughts and Ideas About Beauty, Eating and Image [INFOGRAPHIC]|date=2012-05-18|publisher=Infographic List|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the high number of publications featuring articles promoting unhealthy weight loss, the ''U.S. Department of Health and Human Services'' reported an astounding 90% of teenage girls voiced the need to change their appearances,&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-body-image|title=What is Body Image?|publisher=National Eating Disorders Association|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 81% of 10 year olds were already afraid of being fat.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; As a result, many argue that fashion and media's powerful role on body image and self-perception, will spiral into eating disorders, According to a survey by the ''[[Manchester Metropolitan University]]'', "self-esteem and views of body image suffered after the participants were shown magazine pictures of models, [suggests] that media portrayal of images can prolong anorexia and bulimia in women and may even be a cause of it"&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;'''.'''

According to ''Dove's Global Beauty And Confidence'' report, "a total of 71% of women and 67% of girls want to call on the media to do a better job portraying women of diverse physical appearance, age, race, shape and size."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In addition, 67% of men now strongly believe that it is unacceptable for brands to use photo manipulation techniques to alter the body image of a model.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; To counter such issues, the fashion magazine industry has made efforts in including 'real' women, and reducing or banning the use of airbrushing tools. Despite the amount of feminist features in magazines though, "body [[fascism]] is [still] reinforced by the advertisements, fashion stories and beauty pages."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Likewise, fashion brands and retailers adopt vanity sizing in their assortments to intentionally raise a customer's self-esteem while shopping in stores. This involves labeling clothes with smaller sizes than the actual cut of the items, to trick and attract the consumer. The strategy was based on research reporting the lowering of customer self-esteems and interests, in products with larger sizing labels.

Less is usually known about the pressures models in the industry face, but striving hard to meet the requirements of their agency or brand is a main facet. Among the group, 69% were told to tone up,&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.northeastern.edu/2017/02/fashion-week-brings-questions-about-body-image-front-and-center/|title=Fashion Week brings questions about body image front and center|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 62% cited that their agencies required them to lose weight or change their body shape.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Another 54% of models revealed that they would be dropped by their agencies if they failed to comply.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;  Hence, models habitually weigh themselves under the healthy [[Body Mass Index]] (BMI) level. A study published in the [[International Journal of Eating Disorders]], discovered that a majority of models had a body mass index (BMI) of 17.41,&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; which qualifies for anorexia.

In the past twenty years, runway models have also transformed from a typical size 6-8 to 0-2. The average weight of a typical model in the United States was ecorded to be twenty-three percent less than an average woman in society. This phenomenon has caused countless of models to suffer from illness such as eating disorders and anorexia nervosa. In extreme cases, some models have died due to complications caused by eating disorders. In 2006, the fashion industry came under fire due to the untimely death of two models; [[Luisel Ramos]], and [[Ana Carolina Reston]]. Both girls suffered complications from their eating disorders, and were severely underweight. Owing to the intensifying burdens, a high number of models are therefore willing to participate in intensive exercise regimes, diets, [[Fasting|fasts]], and detoxes; in order to maintain or lose weight. In addition, 17% have admitted to stimulant abuse,&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; while another 8% frequently engaged in self-induced vomiting.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

=== Attempts to improve ===
{{See|Body image law}}

With the aim of protecting models and projecting a healthier body image, [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Brazil]], and [[Israel]], passed bills that prohibit models from working with a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/summer-rayne-oakes/the-skinny-of-fashions-body-image-issue_b_3308004.html|title=The Skinny of Fashion's Body-Image Issue|last=Oakes|first=Summer Rayne|date=2013-05-22|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK and U.S., chose to use less compelling tactics of cultivating the general public through the promotion of education campaigns in society. France on the other hand, introduced a new regulation this year preventing the employment of extremely skinny models,&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; and the need for a medical certificate to verify their health.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; This was an update to the previous law passed that prohibited agencies from using models with a BMI lower than 18.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; France is also working on ensuring retailers specify airbrushed images in magazines, websites, and advertisements.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/07/france-laws-thin-models-retouched-photographs|title=Digital fakery? My dear, that is just so last year |last=Ellen|first=Barbara|date=2017-05-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argue that these laws may not be effective as, majority of individuals are already aware of digital retouching techniques, and may even use it themselves.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

Due to the criticisms surrounding the glamourising of eating disorders, brands are actively playing their part in cultivating better body images too. Fashion conglomerates; ''[[Kering]]'' and ''[[LVMH]]'', recently "announced that they will no longer hire models smaller than a U.S. size 2".&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Not only will this improve the working conditions of models, both companies hope it may inspire others to follow suit. Although, the industry is moving in the right direction, it is arguable that the banning of size zero could be seen as a discriminatory act; similar to thin shaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.racked.com/2017/9/6/16263360/lvmh-kering-skinny-model-ban|title=This Isn't the Answer to Fashion's Body-Image Issues|publisher=Racked|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that reasons, focus should be placed on altering beauty norms, rather than blame the wearer for their size. Moreover, the announcement of a small and minimum dress size, which does not fit the average body type of most countries, continues to "send the message that super slim body types is the 'ideal'".&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lvmh-kering-pledge_uk_59b0f9d7e4b0354e440f56c9|title=Will French Fashion Brands' Ban On Size Zero And Underage Models Really Make A Difference?|date=2017-09-07|publisher=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attributable to the level of interest in women who do not match the proportions of average models, [[plus-size model]]s are slowly emerging in the mainstream media. With several utilising their positions to promote body positivity, their continued presence in the industry, undoubtedly reign beneficial to the health of other models and customers. Health reporter Philippa of&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-29569473|title=Does social media impact on body image?|last=Roxby|first=Philippa|date=2014-10-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[BBC News]] discusses how the introduction of more diversity upon body images can be a helpful factor into improving self-confidence for all body types. Prominent names include [[Ashley Graham (model)|Ashley Graham]]; who is the face of popular plus-size retailer ''[[Lane Bryant]]'', and [[Iskra Lawrence]]; who is a classified role model for lingerie and swimwear retailer ''[[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]]''. Fashion magazines are beginning to include plus-size models as well, with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' gaining worldwide attention when it showcased the first plus-size model on the cover of its [[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue|swimsuit issue]].&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Real Women Have Curves |last=Bazilian |first=Emma |magazine=[[Adweek]] |date=April 25, 2016 |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA451229452&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=ko_k12hs_d73&amp;it=r&amp;p=GPS&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=d7d9761b9b364c6d5dbff6ac2a615991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2018|reason=Article says attention was national not worldwide}}

Fashion designers are also strong supporters for embracing diversity and healthy body ideals in fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-bites/plus-size-new-york-fashion-week-ashley-graham-candice-huffine-kelly-slater-itsnotok-teatum-jones-disabled-body|title=News Bites {{!}} NYFW Gets Real About Plus-Size, Kelly Slater Says #itsnotok and More...|date=2017-02-16|publisher=The Business of Fashion|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Christian Siriano]]'' specifically, shocked the fashion world by casting five plus-size models for his [[New York Fashion Week]] shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.onbreaking.com/entertainment/interview-with-christian-siriano-about-his-runway-show-with-plus-size-models/2752/|title=Christian Siriano talk about Plus Size Models|date=2016-09-14|publisher=On Breaking|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the box-office success of ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', Siriano also made global headlines after he designed a gown for actress [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]], because no one else would.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/style/christian-siriano-confirms-that-leslie-jones-is-a-pretty-woman-at-the-ghostbusters-premiere/|title=Christian Siriano Confirms that Leslie Jones Is a Pretty Woman at the Ghostbusters Premiere|date=2016-07-10|work=People |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a high number of plus-size models dominated the runways this year, print advertisements saw a decrease, with only 2.2% casted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefashionspot.com/runway-news/762095-diversity-report-fall-2017-ad-campaigns/|title=Diversity Report: The Fall 2017 Ads Were More Inclusive Than the Runways for the First Time Ever|date=2017-08-29|publisher=theFashionSpot|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Models who publicly advocate their opinions of the fashion industry are growing as well, especially with the criticism and strain placed on their well-beings. Many have notably used ''Instagram'' as a tool to "encourage self-acceptance, fight back against body-shamers, and post plenty of selfies celebrating their figure".&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}  In the U.S., a group of plus-size models launched the ''#DearNYFW'' campaign, which targeted the fashion industry's harmful approach towards their bodies.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/started-breaking-ribs-fashion-week-models-hit-back-against-pressure/|title='I started breaking my ribs': Fashion week models hit back against the pressure to lose weight|last=Rahim|first=Lucy|date=2017-06-01|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement was broadcast across different social media platforms, with other models using the hashtag to share their experience, in hopes of persuading the American fashion industry to start "prioritizing health and celebrate diversity on the runway".&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

In regards to men falling victims to body image issues, fashion photographer [[Tarik Carroll]] released a photo series titled the ''EveryMAN Project''. The project showcased large-framed [[queer]] and [[transgender men]] of color, with the purpose of "challenging [[Hypermasculinity|hyper-masculinity]] and [[gender norms]], while bringing body-positivity to the forefront".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/fashion-photographer-promotes-acceptance-everyman-n783881|title=Fashion photographer promotes acceptance of "EveryMAN"|publisher=NBC News|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthmore, Caroll aims to enlighten society about body image struggles in men, after hearing the complaints of male models.

The lack of fashion-forward plus-size clothing in the fashion industry on the other hand, has given rise to the ''#PlusIsEqual'' movement. There was often a misconception by retailers that full-figured women{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} were not interested in purchasing trendy styles. However, high-street brands such as [[Forever 21]], and [[ASOS.com|ASOS]], have increased product offerings to include plus-size options for their customers.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://digiday.com/marketing/loud-proud-social-media-pushed-retail-body-positive/|title='Loud and proud': How social media pushed retail to be more body-positive - Digiday|date=2016-02-25|publisher=[[Digiday]]|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other brands include, ''[[Victoria Beckham]]'' who plans to release a range of high-street clothing with sizes up to XXXL in the upcoming months,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/the-beauty-curve-here-s-how-the-fashion-industry-embraced-plus-sizes/story-A3zwYFeeZIMAsTs1vQWEpK.html|title=The beauty curve: Here's how the fashion industry is embracing plus sized clothes|date=2017-07-12|work=Hindustan Times |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'' who expanded their plus size collection to cater for sizes 1X to 3X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/nike-plus-size-range-xl-xxxl-body-positive-sportswear-clothing-a7609341.html|title=Nike has finally launched its first plus size range|date=2017-03-03|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the criticisms surrounding the term plus-size causing unnecessary labeling, ''[[Kmart]]'' therefore replaced its numerical sizing with positive tags such as, "lovely" and "fabulous" instead.&lt;ref name="NoSizeFitsAll"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/lifestyle/article/nosizefitsall-the-rise-of-body-positive-fashion.html|title=#NoSizeFitsAll: The rise of body-positive fashion|publisher=Cafe Babel|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protesting against photo retouching is another important aspect towards body positivity, with the most famous example being Aerie's ''ArieReal'' campaign. Since 2014, the movement promised to display "campaign spreads and brand imagery with stomach rolls, gapless thighs and other perceived flaws that would normally have been edited out of the ads".&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt; Other brands such as ''Neon Moon'', which is a feminist lingerie brand from London, deeply believes in embracing and advocating the beauty of flaws, instead of the need to retouch their models for aesthetic purposes. Hence, campaigns often feature a range of "diverse models and lack of airbrushing as a marketing tool".&lt;ref name="NoSizeFitsAll" /&gt; U.S. e-tailer ''[[ModCloth]]'' on the other hand, explored other methods including, employing their staff as models for the swimwear collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/style/modcloth-proves-we-all-have-swimsuit-bodies-new-body-positive-t90081|title='We all have swimsuit bodies': See Modcloth's empowering new campaign|last=Murray|first=Rheana|work=Today |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social media ==
In the past, exposure to photos or articles were primarily found in traditional media; however, the accessibility of the internet today has resulted in an infinite array online. The world we inhabit is transpiring into a saturated place driven by imageries, which "force [narrower] standards of beauty than ever before".&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://verilymag.com/2017/03/body-image-beauty-standards-media|title=Here's How Body Image Issues Can Affect You (Even if You Don't Have an Eating Disorder)|publisher=Verily|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the greatest influence the internet has on body image, is the creation of [[social media]]. Users are constantly bombarded by notifications, posts, and photos about the lives of others; "sending messages about what we could, should, or would be if we only purchased certain products, made certain choices, or engaged in certain behaviors".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Despite the ability to create and control content on social media, "the same unattainable body ideals we see in traditional media are also reflected in the online environment."&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unisa.edu.au/Media-Centre/Releases/2017-Media-Releases/The-beauty-myth-puts-big-users-of-social-at-risk-of-low-self-esteem-media/|title=The beauty myth puts big users of social media at risk of low self-esteem |publisher=University of South Austalia |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-engagement with social networking platforms and images will therefore, also "encourage a psychological adoption of unrealistic beauty ideals ..., [which] can lead to poor body image and low self-esteem".&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

In 2016, psychologists confirmed the relationship between social media usage and body image anxieties, dieting, and the goal towards thinness. Based on a survey, 56% of women acknowledged the effect of the "social media culture in driving the pressure for perfection and negative body image";&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; whereby it forces them to look a certain way. These platforms further reiterate the need for individuals to compare themselves with others online, resulting in higher expectations towards their standards of beauty.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Hence, 42% of women stated social media caused them to feel worse about their bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2016/04/107683/female-body-image-statistics-2016|title=This Is How Women Actually Feel About Their Bodies|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another study by the ''[[University of South Australia]]'', discovered that individuals who frequently uploaded or viewed appearance-related items were more likely to internalise the thin ideal.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

Applications such as ''Instagram'' have become a "body-image battleground",&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; while the "selfie" is now the universal lens in which individuals use to criticise their bodies and others.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; ''Facebook'' and ''[[Snapchat]]'' also allow users to receive appearance approvals and community acceptance through the ratio of views, comments, and likes. Since individuals who use social media platforms often only display the high points of their lives, a survey by ''[[Common Sense Media|Common Sense]]'' reported that 22% felt bad if their posts were ignored, or if it did not receive the amount of attention they hoped for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/12/health/girls-social-media-self-image-partner/index.html|title=How girls use social media to build up, break down self-image |author=Caroline Knorr |publisher=CNN|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could serve as a trigger for more insecurities, with many utilising digital manipulation techniques as well, to modify their photos in order to meet the media-crafted ideals of thinness and perfection. According to research by the ''[[Renfrew Center Foundation]]'', 50% of men and 70% of 18 to 35-year-old women edited their images before uploading.&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/05/friends-pictures-on-social-media-biggest-impact-body-image|title=Friends' pictures on social media have biggest impact on body image|last=Ratcliffe|first=Rebecca|date=2017-03-05|work=The Observer|access-date=2017-11-01 |issn=0029-7712}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, 35% of respondents were also actively concerned about being tagged in unattractive photos, while 27% fretted about their appearances online.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt; Yet, with the presence of fake imagery, a majority of individuals still habitually fixate on the lifestyles and belongings of others.

With the growth of the wellness industry in recent years, social media platforms have witnessed an assortment of [[Fitness culture|fitness]] influencers{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} and trends. Followers obsessively pursue these diet and exercise regimes posted as a way to remain healthy, while the influencers{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} hope it generates body positivity in return. Yet, these [[bloggers]] and companies have received numerous criticism because the "drive for 'wellness' and 'clean eating' has become stealthy covers for more dieting and deprivation".&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://time.com/4459153/social-media-body-image/|title=How Social Media Is a Toxic Mirror|work=Time|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports have also shown that the messages delivered by "fitspiration" websites are sometimes identical to the "thinspiration" or pro-anorexia types.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/jm5nvp/ruby-tandoh-eat-clean-wellness|title=The Unhealthy Truth Behind 'Wellness' and 'Clean Eating'|date=2016-05-13|work=Vice|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident through "language inducing [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] about weight or the body, and promoted dieting".&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Although the wellness trend may not lead to eating disorders, the marketing of restrictive diets to young women as a form of self care could potentially cause "increasingly [[disordered eating]]",&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; whereby they became more concerned with ingredients and limited certain types of food. This illness is better known as [[Orthorexia nervosa|Orthorexia]]; which is the obsession with the right and wrong types of food.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

=== Attempts to improve ===
As an attempt to tackle such issues, the UK launched a national campaign called ''Be Real,'' after findings showed 76% of secondary school students who learnt about body confidence in class felt more positive about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://academytoday.co.uk/Article/almost-a-third-of-11-16-year-olds-have-body-image-anxiety|title=Almost a third of 11-16 year-olds have body image anxiety|publisher=Academy Today|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this movement was thus to improve body confidence through educational resources provided to schools, and persuading the media, businesses, and the diet industry to endorse different body shapes and sizes instead.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt; Despite the negative outcomes of technological advancements altering the perceptions of an individual's body image and mental health, the cultivation of social media is still beneficial.

Parallel to traditional media, it may be employed as a tool to share and spread body positivity. Social networking sites and applications ultimately build a platform for users to speak out on issues, with many industry insiders utilising their online leverage to protest for change. Previous techniques brands and influencers have tested include, the promotion of a positive body image through popular [[hashtag]]s and marketing campaigns, and the formation of groups that support self-love and the banning of body shaming.

In response to the criticism of social media driving eating disorders, platforms such as ''Instagram'', have banned the use of '''thinspiration''' and '''thinspo''' related hashtags. Other solutions include transformation photos, and the promotion of hashtags such as ''#SelfLove'' and ''#BodyPositivity''&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.self.com/story/side-by-side-photos|title=20 Side-by-Side Photos That Show How Misleading Social Media Can Be|last=Lanquist|first=Lindsey|work=Self |access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''

[[Celebrity culture]] is known as one of the main influences on body image for this generation. Studies in this area have been carried out with the majority proving that viewing media images affects participants abilities to correctly estimate the size and parts of their own bodies.

== Measurement ==

Body image is often measured by asking the subject to rate their current and ideal body shape using a series of depictions. The difference between these two values is the measure of body dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction in girls can have many negative effects, including an increased rate of [[smoking]] and a decrease in comfort with [[sexuality]] when they're older, which may lead them to consider cosmetic surgery.{{efn|An increase in women's weight dissatisfaction is found when women see idealized images of women viewed as passive sexual objects or angelic sexual subjects.{{cite journal|last1=Halliwell|first1=Emma|last2=Malson|first2=Helen|last3=Tischner|first3=Irmgard|title=Are Contemporary Media Images Which Seem to Display Women as Sexually Empowered Actually Harmful to Women?|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=35|issue=1|year=2011|pages=38–45|issn=0361-6843|doi=10.1177/0361684310385217}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|title=Healthy body image: tips for guiding girls.|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/tween-and-teen-health/in-depth/healthy-body-image/art-20044668|publisher=MayoClinic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, the dieting industry earns roughly 40 billion dollars per year. A [[Harvard University|Harvard]] study (Fat Talk, Harvard University Press) published in 2000 revealed that 86% of teenage girls are on a [[Dieting|diet]] or believe they should be on one. Dieting has become a very common thing to not only teenage girls but even younger children as well. The [[National Eating Disorders Association]] has found out that 51% of 9- and 10-year-old girls actually feel better about themselves when they are on a diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nault|first=Kelly|title=How the Media Affects Teen Girls|url=http://www.insteadoftv.com/how-the-media-affects-teen-girls.html|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently more than 40 "instruments" used to measure body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=J. K.|last2=Altabe|first2=M.|last3=Johnson|first3=S.|last4=Stormer|first4=S.

Because there are so many ways to measure body image, it makes it difficult to draw meaningful research generalizations. Many factors have to be taken into account when measuring body image, including gender, [[ethnicity]], culture, and age.&lt;ref name="Cullari 2002 221–232"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cullari|first=S.,|author2=Vosburgh, M.|author3=Shotwell, A.|author4=Inzodda, J.|author5=Davenport, W.|title=Body-image assessment: A review and evaluation of a new computer-aided measurement technique.|journal=North American Journal of Psychology|year=2002|issue=4(2)|pages=221–232|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=psyh&amp;AN=2002-17480-006&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Figure preferences ===

In figure preferences the use of silhouettes is the most commonly used method. [[Silhouette]]s can be defined by a figures shape or dark outline upon a lighter background. There are many issues with this method though; for one, the drawings are not realistic looking and were originally portrayed as adults so it made them unsuitable for children.&lt;ref name="Cullari 2002 221–232"/&gt; Silhouettes are used to show to the subject and have them react to the different body types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=1d539162-5f98-4f55-bcb2-3670ba57a382@sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==|title=Body-image assessment: A review and evaluation of a new computer-aided meas...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe Photoshop to fit their personal preference upon their body image, altering body tones, shape or size.

=== Video projection techniques ===

In one study participants were shown a series of images flashing before them; each image was a picture of them but either increased weight or decreased weight. They were measured in self-report by responding to the pictures. Also they were measured by startle-based measures and testing their eyeblink response. "The startle response is a complex set of physiological changes that occur in response to unexpected and intense stimulus."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grillon|first=Christian|last2=Baas|first2=Johanna|date=2003-09-01|title=A review of the modulation of the startle reflex by affective states and its application in psychiatry|journal=Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=114|issue=9|pages=1557–1579|issn=1388-2457|pmid=12948786|doi=10.1016/s1388-2457(03)00202-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measurements can be useful because "Objective, [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] measures, like the affect modulated startle eyeblink response, are less subject to reporting bias."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spresser|first=C.

=== Questionnaires ===

Questionnaires are another very commonly used method of measurement. One example of a questionnaire is BASS; it is a 9-item subscale of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. It uses a rating scale from −2 to +2 and assesses eight body areas and attributes and overall appearance (face, hair, lower torso, mid-torso, upper torso, [[muscle tone]], height, and weight).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giovannelli|first=Thorayya Said|last2=Cash|first2=Thomas F.|last3=Henson|first3=James M.|last4=Engle|first4=Erin K.|date=2008-06-01|title=The measurement of body-image dissatisfaction-satisfaction: is rating importance important?|journal=Body Image|volume=5|issue=2|pages=216–223|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2008.01.001|issn=1873-6807|pmid=18463010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questionnaires can have confounding variable though.

== Gender differences ==

Gender differences related to body image are increasingly prevalent between men and women. Although dissatisfaction is more common in women, men are becoming more negatively affected than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Body image perceptions: Do gender differences exist? | journal = Psi Chi Journal of Undergraduate Research | year = 2010 | first = Maggie A. | last = Brennan |author2=Christopher E.

[[Adolescence]] is where this difference is most notable. One reason for this is because males are being targeted in the media more heavily today. Historically, and for a much longer period of time, the media has immoderately targeted females, which may explain why they are becoming less sensitized to the effects.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2010-24583-007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mellor|first=David|author2=Matthew Fuller-Tyszkiewicz|author3=Marita P.

Some research has suggested this relationship between muscle and masculinity may begin early in life, as boys' action figures are often depicted as super-muscular, often beyond the actual limits of [[Human Physiology|human physiology]]. The connection between masculinity and muscle is however a cultural trend traced as far back as the Classical antiquity and linked to the war performance and its peaceful substitutes, the athletic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sideris |first=A.|url=https://www.academia.edu/481380/The_Athletic_Body_Image_and_Power=|title=The Athletic Body: Image and Power|journal=Imeros|volume=5|issue=1|year= 2005|pages= 287–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, men with lower, more feminine, [[Waist–hip ratio]] (WHR) feel less comfortable and self-report lower body esteem and self-efficacy than men with higher, more masculine, WHRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Pazhoohi| first1=Farid| last2=Hosseinchari|first2=M.|last3=Doyle|first3=J.

In general, research shows that body image in regards to appearance becomes less of a [[Psychological stress|stress]] for women as they age. Studies show a decline in dissatisfaction of body image in college-aged women as they progress from the first semester of college to subsequent semesters. Their appearance rating of themselves tends to increase, while males' do not significantly change and often become worse. This suggests that the early years of [[college]] serve as a period for body image development, which can later affect the mental and physical well being of an individual.&lt;ref name='PsycInfo 2011-30272-014'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Gender and racial/ethnic differences in body image development among college students | journal = Body Image | date = January 2012 | first = Meghan M. | last = Gillen |author2=Eva S.

As men and women reach older age, body image takes on a different meaning.  Research studies show that the importance attached to physical appearance decreases with age.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2011-30272-014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esnaola 21–9"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Body dissatisfaction and perceived sociocultural pressures | journal = Salud Mental | date = February 21, 2010 | first = Igor | last = Esnaola |author2=Arantzazu Rodríguez|author3=Alfredo Goñi | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–9| id =  | type =  PDF | accessdate = 2012-06-26 |url=http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/sm/v33n1/v33n1a3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical appearance remains important later in life, but the functional aspects of the body take precedence over contentment with appearance.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2010-24583-007"/&gt; Women are reported to benefit from the [[Ageing|ageing process]], becoming more satisfied with their images, while men begin to develop more insecurities and issues.  Women reach a certain stage where they are no longer subject to the social pressures that heavily emphasize the importance of appearance.  Men from the same studies are reported as becoming increasingly dissatisfied with their physical appearance as they age. Men are also less likely to implement appearance-enhancing activities into their daily lives.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The older women become the more satisfied with their body image they are likely to become because of the relief of stress from societal pressures.&lt;ref name="PsycInfo 2009-11492-005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Lucie|author2=Eyal Gringart|date=August 2009|title=Body image and self-esteem in older adulthood|journal=Ageing &amp; Society|type=PDF|volume=29|issue=6|pages=977–95|doi=10.1017/S0144686X09008721|id=}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-06-27 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The older men become, the more dissatisfied they are likely to become due to increased physical and perceived incompetency.

Adrienne Adams and Eaaron Henderson-king claim that the rates of cosmetic surgery have increased in recent years. It has been proven that the majority of people that undergo cosmetic surgery is a highly gendered activity.

Cosmetic surgery was initially developed largely in response to the reconstructive needs of wounded soldiers, but it is now primarily used in a much more feminine way to improve people's physical appearance and attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Materialism, Sociocultural Appearance messages AND Paternal Attitudes Predict College Women's Attitudes About Cosmetic surgery&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Fat acceptance movement}}The desire to lose weight is highly correlated with poor body image, with more women than men wanting to lose weight.

In her book ''[[The Beauty Myth]]'', [[Naomi Wolf]] reported that "thirty-three thousand women told American researchers they would rather lose ten to fifteen pounds than achieve any other goal."&lt;ref name=Wolf1991 /&gt; Through repeated images of excessively thin women in media, advertisement, and modeling, thinness has become associated with not only beauty, but happiness and success. As [[Charisse Goodman]] put it in her article, "One Picture is Worth a Thousand Diets", advertisements have changed society's ideas of beauty and ugliness: "Indeed to judge by the phrasing of the ads, 'slender' and 'attractive' are one word, not two in the same fashion as 'fat' and 'ugly.'" This idea of beauty has become drastically more narrow and unachievable, putting increased pressure on people looking to satisfy society's standards.

Research by Martin and Xavier (2010) shows that people feel more pressure from society to be thin after viewing ads featuring a slim model.

Many, like journalist [[Marisa Meltzer]], have argued this contemporary standard of beauty to be described as anorexic thinness, an unhealthy idea that is not representative of a natural human body: "Never before has the 'perfect' body been at such odds with our true size."&lt;ref name=Wolf1991&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Wolf|first=Naomi |authorlink=Naomi Wolf|title=The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty are Used Against Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgfokiNQl0sC|year=1991|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0-09-986190-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meltzer, Marisa.

However, these figures do not distinguish between people at a low or healthy weight who are in fact overweight, between those whose self-perception as being overweight is incorrect and those whose perception of being overweight is correct.

Research by [[The Lancet Psychiatry|The Lancent Psychiatry]] discusses the relationship between mass media and eating disorders stating,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutiérrez|first=Emilio|last2=Carrera|first2=Olaia|date=February 2016|title=Anorexia nervosa and body-image disturbance|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(15)00581-7/fulltext|journal=The Lancet Psychiatry|language=English|volume=3|issue=2|pages=e9–e10|doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(15)00581-7|issn=2215-0366|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Body-image disturbance and weight and shape concerns are the result of an acculturation process spread through the therapeutic milieu and the mass media." The struggles caused by body imaging have led to the increase of Anorexia nervosa diagnosis. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that results in significant weight loss due to a persons own distorted body image. Its increasing rate shows the correlation between the effects body imaging through social media has on people especially upon women and how it effects the measures of weight loss.

Post-1997 studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Obesity Statistics: U.S. Obesity Trends|url = http://www.naaso.org/statistics/obesity_trends.asp|publisher = North American Association for the Study of Obesity|accessdate = 2008-03-08|year = 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060206185213/http://www.naaso.org/statistics/obesity_trends.asp|archivedate = 2006-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that around 64% of American adults are overweight, such that if the 56%/40% female/male dissatisfaction rates in the ''[[Psychology Today]]'' study have held steady since its release, those dissatisfaction rates are if anything disproportionately low: although some individuals continue to believe themselves to be overweight when they are not, those persons are now outnumbered by persons who might be expected to be dissatisfied with their body but are not.

In turn, although social pressure to lose weight has adverse effects on some individuals who do not need to lose weight, those adverse effects are arguably outweighed by that social pressure's ''positive'' effect on the overall population, without which the recent increases in obesity and associated health and social problems (described in both popular and academic parlance as an "[[obesity epidemic]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Statistics Related to Overweight and Obesity|url = http://www.win.niddk.nih.gov/statistics/|publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]|year = 2006|accessdate = 2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/mxm007v1|title = The obesity epidemic in the United States—gender, age, socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and geographic characteristics: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis|last1 = Wang|first1 = Youfa|last2 = Beydoun|first2 = May A|journal = Epidemiologic Reviews|year = 2007 |doi = 10.1093/epirev/mxm007|pmid = 17510091|volume = 29|pages = 6–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be even more severe than they already are.&lt;ref name="ThompsonHeinberg1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=J.

[[Miss Representation]]&lt;ref&gt;Synopsis. (January 1, 2014). Retrieved May 5, 2014, from http://film.missrepresentation.org/synopsis&lt;/ref&gt; is a documentary by [[Jennifer Siebel Newsom]], exploring and displaying the role that mainstream media plays in society today with regards to women and the under-representation of women in influential positions. Prominent women in today's society were featured in discussing how the media has impacted their life along with their views on how the media is impacting the lives of people from an early age. These media messages have a severe impact on how individuals carry themselves along with what aspects bog them down like insecurities with body image. This film encourages viewers to start to see beyond the message and not compare themselves to these picture perfect computer-generated images.

The 2007 documentary [[America the Beautiful (film)|America the Beautiful]] explores how the fashion and beauty industries are contributing to the problems that individuals feel regarding body image due to their beauty obsession. The film discusses a wide range of topics like [[plastic surgery]], dieting, eating disorders, the modeling industry along with the fashion industry and much more. Young [[Middle school|middle-school]] aged girls were portrayed in the beginning of the film and asked if they found themselves beautiful. The girls who are around the ages of 13 had decided that they were not beautiful. In today's society, people are starting to see themselves as ugly at an earlier age than ever before. As individuals who identify as ugly increase, the number of body image issues also increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/america-the-beautiful-a-problem-of-self-image/82590/|title='America the Beautiful': A Problem of Self-Image|last=Snyder|first=S.

In a study performed by Leslie J. Heinberg of [[Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], and J. Kevin Thompson of the [[University of South Florida]], results showed that women exposed to appearance based advertisements experienced a significant growth in [[Depression (mood)|depression]], anxiety, [[anger]], and body dissatisfaction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In a study done at [[Old Dominion University]], Thomas F. Cash, [[Julie Ancis|Julie R. Ancis]] and Melissa D. Strachan studied college women and their attitudes toward gender, feminist identity and body image. "Relative to men, women are considerably more psychologically invested in their appearance. Moreover, women's poor evaluations of and stronger investments in their looks potentiate greater body-image [[dysphoria]] in women's daily lives."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cash | first1 = T. F. | last2 = Ancis | first2 = J. R. | year = 1997 | title = Gender attitudes, feminist identity, and body image among college women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 36 | issue = 7/8| pages = 433–447 | doi=10.1007/bf02766682}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contributing factor in this scenario that leads women to greater objectification of their bodies are the images that are seen throughout media. Women who are portrayed in the media often possess unattainable beauty. "Furthermore, the social construct of femininity is partially tied to perceived beauty, as evinced by the 'what is beautiful sex-typed' stereotype."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"/&gt; These internalized ideals along with the pursuit for this unattainable beauty of one's body image can lead to [[body dysmorphic disorder]], body objectification, eating disorders, anxiety, depression and other related psychological difficulties.

In the same study from [[Arizona State University]], it was said that the idea of beauty is generated from these media messages. "Cultural messages about beauty (i.e. what it is, how it should be cultivated, and how it will be rewarded) are often implicitly conveyed through media representations of women."&lt;ref name="Rubin, L. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = L | year = 2004 | title = Exploring Feminist Women's Body Consciousness | url = | journal = Psychology Of Women Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 27–37 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00120.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study from Old Dominion University, the authors state the importance of research in this area. "Given the centrality of body image in clinical and sub clinical eating disturbances that are so prevalent among women, research on gender and body image has substantial importance."&lt;ref name="Cash, T. F. 1997"/&gt; Even though there is research being done, there is still much more work to be done to help individuals who struggle with their body image.

The link between body image and eating disorders is becoming increasingly prominent in the younger generations as the growth of social media and social influencers inhibits their perspective on their own bodies.&lt;ref name="NaeimiHaghighian2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naeimi|first1=Alireza Farsad|last2=Haghighian|first2=Hossein Khadem|last3=Gargari|first3=Bahram Pourghassem |last4=Alizadeh|first4=Mohammad|last5=Rouzitalab|first5=Tohid|title=Eating disorders risk and its relation to self-esteem and body image in Iranian university students of medical sciences|journal=Eating and Weight Disorders - Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity|volume=21|issue=4|year=2016|pages=597–605|issn=1124-4909|doi=10.1007/s40519-016-0283-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat unhealthy body image issues among women, in 2015, [[France]] passed a law requiring models to be declared healthy by a doctor to participate in fashion shows. It also requires re-touched images to be marked as such in magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Willsher (December 18, 2015), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/18/models-doctors-note-prove-not-too-thin-france Models in France must provide doctor's note to work], ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight- The Psychosocial burden of childhood overweight and Obesity:
Children also have a hard time dealing with 'body image' and can face discrimination. According to (''[[European Journal of Pediatrics]]'' 2017 ) 
According to research, It has shown that the psychological, social and behavioral consequences of childhood obesity shows that children who are overweight experience not only discrimination but overall body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, [[social isolation]] and depression.

== Race ==
Perceptions of races have drastically changed over the years dating all the way back to the [[medieval era]] referencing light and dark, good and evil. Hundreds of years later perceptions would be changed again with the [[Atlantic slave trade]], which left ideas of idealism for [[White people|Caucasians]] and a negative idea of any other race. [[White nationalism|Caucasian nationalists]] such as Goldstein also believed that all races originated from the 'white' race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/graywhite1e/#t_823553____|title=Freedom on my mind: A history of African Americans|last=Bay|last2=White|first2=Deborah Gray|last3=Martin|first3=Waldo E.|date=|location=New York|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins |year=2013|last1=|first1=Mia|accessdate=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this extreme racism of the time the black body was studied, displayed and scrutinized for any minor difference. "The ideas about beauty we contend with in the twenty- first century draw in part on very old ways of thinking about human bodies and [[African people|African]] difference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Camp|first1=Stephanie|title=Black Is Beautiful: An American History|journal=Journal of Southern History|date=April 2015|volume=3|page=678}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s the [[Black is Beautiful]] movement and [[Black Power]] movement took form and shook the world in a display of racial pride. Today's perceptions of different races has come a long way in bringing a positive mentality to racial body image but there are still some core issues in today's society.

The [[fashion industry]] is known for not being inclusive of more races in their runways and ad campaigns, and several studies that have been conducted prove that the lack of racial diversity can contribute to body image issues amongst non-white minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://cswr.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bryant.-The-beauty-ideal-The-effects-of-European-standards-of-beauty-on-Black-women..pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131210214658/http://cswr.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bryant.-The-beauty-ideal-The-effects-of-European-standards-of-beauty-on-Black-women..pdf|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2013-12-10|title = The Beauty Ideal: The Effects of European Standards of Beauty on Black Women|last = Bryant|first = Susan L|date = n.d.|journal = Columbia Social Work Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one such experiment, conducted in 2003, 3 photographs of attractive [[white people|white]], [[black people|black]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] women were shown to a group of white, black and Asian students. The study concluded that Asian women thought that the photograph of the white woman was the most attractive, and reported high levels of body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.allenmcconnell.net/pdfs/racialminorities-SAI-2003.pdf|title = Do Racial Minorities Respond in the Same Way to Mainstream Beauty Standards? Social Comparison Processes in Asian, Black, and White Women|last = McConnell|first = Allen|date = 2003|journal = Self and Identity| volume = 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such dissatisfaction may even cause these individuals to suffer psychologically due to the pressure to embody these ideals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Beauty Teaches Minorities To Look More White|url = http://www.refinery29.com/minority-beauty|publisher = Refinery29|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may result in them going through several means to change their physical appearance in order to match the [[Eurocentric]] idea of beauty.

[[Weight loss]] is one such method. For instance, [[Mexican American]] women who have been attuned to mainstream US culture reported greater body dissatisfaction and have described their ideal body types to be similar to the [[White normalcy|white norm]]. In spite of the fact that certain ethnicities naturally have different body types,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/race-is-part-of-the-body-image-conversation-so-why-dont-we-talk-about-it-8600605.htm|title = Race is part of the body image conversation, so why don't we talk about it?|date = May 2, 2013|accessdate = October 25, 2015|newspaper=The Independent |last = Devon|first = Natasha}}&lt;/ref&gt; this ideal has led to disordered eating amongst [[Latino|Latinas]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |title = Beauty Whitewashed: How White Ideals Exclude Women of Color |url = http://www.beautyredefined.net/beauty-whitewashed-how-white-ideals-exclude-women-of-color/|publisher = Beauty Redefined |accessdate = 2015-11-07|language = en-US|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110306151312/http://www.beautyredefined.net/beauty-whitewashed-how-white-ideals-exclude-women-of-color/|archivedate = 2011-03-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plastic surgery]] is another method, and is especially popular in Asia for "[[Westernization|Westernizing]]" facial features. Two of the most popular treatments are [[rhinoplasty]] (nose lifts), and [[blepharoplasty]] (eyelid lifts), which are done to make these features look more Caucasian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asia's ideal beauty: Looking Caucasian - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/25/health/asian-beauty/index.html|publisher = CNN|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Skin-lightening|Skin lightening]] products are also prevalent in countries where non-white ethnicities are the majority, and the industry makes billions of dollars every year.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In [[Racism in India|India]] alone, whitening products make up 45% of the skin care market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Skin lightening trend in Asia boosts global market|url = http://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/market-trends/skin-lightening-trend-in-asia-boosts-global-market|publisher = CosmeticsDesign-Asia.com|accessdate = 2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plenty of these whitening cosmetics are known to have dangerous side effects due to the ingredients in them; [[hydroquinone]], for instance, is known to cause irritation and [[leukemia]]{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} while [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is known to cause [[rash]]es and pigmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Bob Fredericks |title=Health officials warn of mercury levels in skin-lightening creams |url=https://nypost.com/2018/04/06/health-officials-warn-of-mercury-levels-in-skin-lightening-creams/ |website=New York Post |accessdate=17 June 2018 |date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of these effects, industries like the fashion industry have not significantly featured women of color (and when they have, the women may have either been significantly "whitewashed" – with digitally lightened skin and hair – or may already have features that are considered "white").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The fashion industry believes that by advertising unattainable standards of beauty, they fuel a customer demand by "creating a craving that can't be satisfied".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Can using different types of models benefit brands?|url = http://www.ellecanada.com/living/culture/can-using-different-types-of-models-benefit-brands/a/58327 |publisher = Elle Canada|accessdate = 2015-11-07|language = en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study by [[Elle Canada]] has proven the exact opposite: products featured by models that accurately represent the consumer's race – as well as weight and age – will increase the consumer's willingness to purchase a product.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4801">'''Cave conservation''' is the protection and restoration of [[cave]]s to prevent or minimise the effects of human activities.

Some caves have delicate features that can be disturbed by changes in light levels, humidity, temperature or air flow.  Caves that have lighting that remains on are prone to having algae grow within the cave changing the appearance and ecology.  [[Speleothems]] grow as a result of water both on cave surfaces and the humidity of the cave air. Changes to these because of a high number of visitors, changes to the cave air flow and changes to the [[hydrology]] will alter speleothem development.

Speleothems can have a slow growth rate and therefore removing them as souvenirs or breakage due to movement within the cave will be visible for a long time, often throughout several generations of human interaction.

The use of [[calcium carbide]] for lamps has led to soot marks and deposits of discarded spent carbide. Using electric lamps avoids these problems.

==Cave conservation by region==

===New Zealand===
The [[New Zealand Speleological Society]] (NZSS), a recreational caving organisation, promotes cave conservation by its members.  The [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] (DoC) is responsible for caves on land under its administration and has developed a management policy for caves and [[karst]]. DoC publish a "Caving care code" which is in turn based in part on the caving ethics of NZSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=38542|title=Minimising your impact - Caving care code|last=DoC|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

The [[British Cave Research Association]] administers the United Kingdom Cave Conservation Emergency Fund (UKCCEF), a charitable fund for protection of caves and cave features. The aims are:
* To assist in the publication of material intended to promote the conservation of caves and features therein or the conservation of a specific site or group of caves     
* To assist with the physical protection of features within a specific cave or group of caves
* To assist in works designed to maintain access to a cave or part of a cave, but not solely to assist exploration
* To assist in the purchase of land or property where such acquisition is intended to ensure the protection of, or maintenance of access to, a cave or caves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcra.org.uk/ukccef/ ukccef info&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Caving Association]] has a Cave Conservation Code with the following recommendations:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caveinfo.org.uk/nca/canda/concode.htm Conservation Code&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415231401/http://www.caveinfo.org.uk/nca/canda/concode.htm |date=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cave with care and within your abilities
*Keep to marked routes and do not cross conservation tapes and barriers
*Protect cave wildlife and do not disturb bats
*Do not pollute the cave, leave nothing behind
*Archaeological and other remains should not be disturbed
*Do not interfere with scientific equipment
*Set a good example for others to follow
*Avoid touching or damaging formations
*Take nothing but photographs
*Comply with any access requirements
*Respect the rights and privacy of land owners

===United States===
The [[National Speleological Society]] believes:
* Caves have unique scientific, recreational, and scenic values
* These values are endangered by both carelessness and intentional vandalism
* These values, once gone, cannot be recovered
* The responsibility for protecting caves must be formed by those who study and enjoy them. 
* A common phrase on ethical caving: "Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints, waste nothing but time."
Also involved in cave conservation are the:
* [[Butler Cave Conservation Society]]
* [[Cave Research Foundation]]

'''Chaining''' is an instructional procedure used in [[behavioral psychology]], [[experimental analysis of behavior]] and [[applied behavior analysis]]. It involves [[reinforcing]] individual responses occurring in a sequence to form a complex behavior. It is frequently used for training behavioral sequences (or "chains") that are beyond the current repertoire of the learner. The term is often credited to the work of [[B.F. Skinner]], an American [[psychologist]] working at Harvard University in the 1930s. 

==Procedure==
The chain of responses is broken down into small steps using [[task analysis]]. Parts of a chain are referred to as links. The learner's skill level is assessed by an appropriate professional and is then either taught one step at a time while being assisted through the other steps forward or backwards or if the learner already can complete a certain percentage of the steps independently, the remaining steps are all worked on during each trial [[total task]]. A verbal stimulus or prompt is used at the beginning of the teaching trial. The stimulus change that occurs between each response becomes the reinforcer for that response as well as the prompt/stimulus for the next response without requiring assistance from the teacher. For example, in purchasing a soda you pull the money out of your pocket and see the money in your hand and then put the money in the machine. Seeing the money in your hand both was the reinforcer for the first response (getting money out of pocket) and was what prompted you to do the next response (putting money in machine).

As small chains become mastered, i.e. are performed consistently following the initial discriminative stimulus prompt, they may be used as links in larger chains. (Ex. teach hand washing, tooth brushing, and showering until mastered and then teach morning hygiene routine which includes the mastered skills). Chaining requires that the teachers present the training skill in the same order each time and is most effective when teachers are delivering the same prompts to the learner. The most common forms of chaining are backward chaining, forward chaining, and total task presentation.&lt;ref name="Cooper, Heron, and Heward"&gt;John O. Cooper, Timothy E. Heron, and William L. Heward, Applied Behavior Analysis, Second Edition, Pearson Education, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===More on Chaining===
There are two different types of chains: homogeneous and heterogeneous. The prior homogeneous chains occur when the topography or form of response are similar in each component.  In contrast, a heterogeneous chain requires different types of responses for each link.&lt;ref name="Pierce and Cheney"&gt;W. David Pierce and Carl D. Cheney, Behavior Analysis and Learning, Fourth Edition, Psychology Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chauffeur''', ([[French language|French]], "heater upper") was a type of French criminal active from the 18th to the 20th centuries. In gangs, they carried out [[Home invasion]]s on remote, rural dwellings, then tortured the householders into revealing the hiding places of savings or valuables. This was often done by burning victims' feet in the fireplace, which gave rise to the name for them.

A notable gang was the [[Chauffeurs de la Drome]] who were responsible for eighteen murders between 1905 and 1908.&lt;ref name="Anderson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm Anderson|title=In Thrall to Political Change: Police and Gendarmerie in France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYqKByxmueEC&amp;pg=PA53|date=25 August 2011|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969364-1|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These attacks continued after the Second World War. ''Le gang des Romanis'' was active in [[Bourgogne]]  and ''Le Gang d’Albert'' was active in [[Picardy]] until their leaders were separately captured and executed in 1952.&lt;ref name="BAUER2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alain BAUER|title=Dictionnaire amoureux du Crime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wJ6hqz3ZVJoC&amp;pg=PT107|date=21 February 2013|publisher=edi8|isbn=978-2-259-22072-9|pages=104–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The '''''Classic of Filial Piety''''',&lt;!--Chinese in infobox; see WP:MOS-ZH--&gt; also known by its [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name as the '''''Xiaojing''''', is a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[Confucian classics|classic]] [[treatise]] giving advice on [[filial piety]]: that is, how to behave towards a senior such as a father, an elder brother, or ruler.

==Authorship==
This document probably dates to the 4th century BC. It is not known who actually wrote the document. It is attributed to a conversation between [[Confucius]] and his disciple [[Zengzi]]. A 12th-century author named He Yin claimed: "The ''Classic of Filial Piety'' was not made by Zengzi himself. When he retired from his conversation (or conversations) with Kung-ne on the subject of Filial Piety, he repeated to the disciples of his own school what (the master) had said, and they classified the sayings, and formed the treatise."

==Content==
As the title suggests, the text elaborates on filial piety, which is a core Confucian value. The text argues that if a person loves and serves their parents then they will do the same for their rulers, leading to a harmonious society. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Legge|first1=James|title=The Classic of Filial Piety 《孝經》|url=http://chinesenotes.com/xiaojing/xiaojing001.html|website=Chinese Notes|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|資於事父以事母，而愛同；資於事父以事君，而敬同
As they serve their fathers, so they serve their mothers, and they love them equally. As they serve their fathers, so they serve their rulers, and they reverence them equally.}}

== Influence ==
The ''Classic of Filial Piety'' occupied an important position in classical education as one of the most popular foundational texts through to late imperial China.{{sfnp|Lu|2017|p=268}} The text was used in elementary and moral education together with the [[Analects]], Elementary Learning, and the [[Biographies of Exemplary Women]].{{sfnp|Lu|2017|p=272}} Study of the text was also mentioned in epitaphs as an indication of a person's good character. It was a practice to read aloud the text when mourning one's parents. The text was also important politically, partly because filial piety was both a means of demonstrating moral virtue and entering officialdom for those with family connections to the imperial court.{{sfnp|Lu|2017|pp=273-277}} The text was important in [[Neo-Confucianism]], being quoted by the influential Song figure [[Zhu Xi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20807">Within biological systems, '''degeneracy''' occurs when structurally dissimilar components/modules/pathways can perform similar functions (i.e. are effectively interchangeable) under certain conditions, but perform distinct functions in other conditions.&lt;ref name="Edelman and Gally"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Edelman and Gally | title =  Degeneracy and complexity in biological systems |  journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | year = 2001 | volume = 98 | issue = 24 | pages = 13763–13768 |  doi = 10.1073/pnas.231499798| last2 =  Gally | first2 =  J.

In particular, if degeneracy is present in a pair of components then there will exist conditions where the pair will appear [[functionally redundant]] but other conditions where they will appear functionally distinct.&lt;ref name="Edelman and Gally"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitacre"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Whitacre | title =  Degeneracy: a link between evolvability, robustness and complexity in biological systems |  journal = Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling | year = 2010 | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | url = http://www.tbiomed.com/content/7/1/6  | accessdate = 2011-03-11 |  doi = 10.1186/1742-4682-7-6 |  pages = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that this use of the term has practically no relevance to the questionably meaningful concept of evolutionarily [[Devolution (biology)|degenerate]] populations that have lost [[Ancestor|ancestral]] functions.

== Biological examples ==
Examples of degeneracy are found in the [[genetic code]], when many different [[nucleotide sequences]] encode the same [[polypeptide]]; in [[protein folding]], when different polypeptides fold to be structurally and functionally equivalent; in [[protein]] functions, when overlapping binding functions and similar catalytic specificities are observed; in [[metabolism]], when multiple, parallel [[biosynthetic]] and [[catabolic]] pathways may coexist.
More generally, degeneracy is observed in proteins of every functional class (e.g. [[enzymatic]], structural, or regulatory),&lt;ref name="Atamas"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Atamas | title =  Les affinités électives |  journal = Pour la Science | year = 2005 | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 39–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Wagner | title =  The role of population size, pleiotropy and fitness effects of mutations in the evolution of overlapping gene functions |  journal = Genetics | year = 2000 | volume = 154 | issue = 3 | pages = 1389–1401 |  pmid = 10757778 |  pmc = 1461000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[protein complex]] assemblies,&lt;ref name="Kurakin"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Kurakin | title =  Scale-free flow of life: on the biology, economics, and physics of the cell |  journal = Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling | year = 2009 | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pmid=19416527 | doi=10.1186/1742-4682-6-6 | pmc=2683819 | pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ontogenesis]],&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Newman | title =  Generic physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis: A common basis for development and evolution |  journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | year = 1994 | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | page = 480 |  doi = 10.1046/j.1420-9101.1994.7040467.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[nervous system]],&lt;ref name="Tononi et al."&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Tononi | title =  Measures of degeneracy and redundancy in biological networks |  journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA | year = 1999 | volume = 96 | issue = 6 | pages = 3257–3262 |  doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.6.3257| last2 =  Sporns | first2 =  O. | last3 =  Edelman | first3 =  G.

== Contribution to robustness ==
Degeneracy contributes to the [[Robustness (evolution)|robustness]] of [[biological trait]]s through several mechanisms. Degenerate components compensate for one another under conditions where they are functionally redundant, thus providing robustness against component or pathway failure. Because degenerate components are somewhat different, they tend to harbor unique sensitivities so that a targeted attack such as a specific [[:wikt:inhibitor|inhibitor]] is less likely to present a risk to all components at once.&lt;ref name="Whitacre" /&gt; There are numerous biological examples where degeneracy contributes to robustness in this way.

[[File:Relationships between degeneracy, complexity, robustness, and evolvability.png|thumb|right|300px|Theoretical relationships between biological properties that are important to evolution. For a review of evidence that supports these relationships, see.&lt;ref name="Whitacre"/&gt;]]

Several theoretical developments have outlined links between degeneracy and important biological measurements related to robustness, complexity, and [[evolvability]]. These include:
* Theoretical arguments supported by simulations have proposed that degeneracy can lead to distributed forms of robustness in protein interaction networks.&lt;ref name="Whitacre and Bender"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Whitacre and Bender | title =  Networked buffering: a basic mechanism for distributed robustness in complex adaptive systems |  journal = Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling | year = 2010 | volume = 7 | issue = 20 | pages = 20| id = | url = http://www.tbiomed.com/content/7/1/20 | accessdate = 2011-03-11 |  doi = 10.1186/1742-4682-7-20 |  last2 = Bender |  first2 = Axel | pmid=20550663 | pmc=2901314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those authors suggest that similar phenomena is likely to arise in other biological networks and potentially may contribute to the resilience of [[ecosystem]]s as well.
* Tononi ''et al.'' have found evidence that degeneracy is inseparable from the existence of hierarchical complexity in [[neural population]]s.&lt;ref name="Tononi et al."/&gt; They argue that the link between degeneracy and complexity is likely to be much more general.
* Fairly abstract simulations have supported the hypothesis that degeneracy fundamentally alters the propensity for a genetic system to access novel heritable [[phenotype]]s&lt;ref name="Whitacre and Bender_b"&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Whitacre and Bender | title =  Degeneracy: a design principle for achieving robustness and evolvability |  journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | year = 2010 | volume = 263 | issue = 1 | pages = 143–153 | id = | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=19925810 | accessdate = 2011-03-11 |  doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.11.008 |  pmid = 19925810 |  last2 = Bender |  first2 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that degeneracy could therefore be a precondition for open-ended [[evolution]].
* The three hypotheses above have been integrated in&lt;ref name="Whitacre"/&gt; where they propose that degeneracy plays a central role in the open-ended evolution of biological complexity. In the same article, it was argued that the absence of degeneracy within many designed (abiotic) complex systems may help to explain why robustness appears to be in conflict with flexibility and adaptability, as seen in software, [[systems engineering]], and [[artificial life]].&lt;ref name="Whitacre"/&gt;

Because there are many distinct types of systems that undergo heritable variation and selection (see [[Universal Darwinism]]), degeneracy has become a highly interdisciplinary topic. The following provides a brief roadmap to the application and study of degeneracy within different disciplines.

'''Description''' is the pattern of narrative development that aims to make vivid a place, object, character, or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Description is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] (also known as ''modes of discourse''), along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]], and [[narration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice it would be difficult to write literature that drew on just one of the four basic modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a fiction-writing mode==
Fiction-writing also has modes: [[Action (fiction)|action]], exposition, description, [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]], summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morrell |2006 |p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, [[Scene (drama)|scenes]], and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Selgin |2007 |p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of [[fiction-writing mode]]s and their uses.

Description is the fiction-writing mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story. Together with dialogue, narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes. As stated in ''Writing from A to Z'', edited by Kirk Polking, description is more than the amassing of details; it is bringing something to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Polking |1990 |p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most appropriate and effective techniques for presenting description are a matter of ongoing discussion among writers and writing coaches.

==Purple prose==
{{Main|Purple prose}}
A purple patch is an over-written passage in which the writer has strained too hard to achieve an impressive effect, by elaborate figures or other means.  The phrase ([[Latin]]:  "purpureus pannus") was first used by the Roman poet [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (c. 20 [[Before Christ|BC]]) to denote an irrelevant and excessively ornate passage; the sense of irrelevance is normally absent in modern usage, although such passages are usually incongruous.  By extension, '''purple prose''' is lavishly figurative, rhythmic, or otherwise overwrought.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
In philosophy, the [[Theory of descriptions|nature of description]] has been an important question since [[Bertrand Russell]]'s classical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last=Ludlow|first= Peter |year=2007|title= Descriptions|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descriptions/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''discourse of power''' is used when it comes to differentiating the levels of [[Power (social and political)|power]] due to cultural and social characteristics that come about through societal upbringing. The ways we think and talk about a subject influence and reflect the ways we act in relation to that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karlburg|first1=Michael|title=The Power of Discourse and the Discourse of Power: Pursuing Peace Through Discourse Intervention|url=http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol10_1/Karlberg_101IJPS.pdf|website=International Journal of Peace Studies|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea of the discourse of power within media has a domino effect and it can play a huge role in determining the patterns of access to the mass media: who has preferential access to journalists, who will be interviewed, who will be quoted and described in news reports, and whose opinions will influence the public? Through access to the mass media, dominant groups also may have access to and partial control over the public at large.&lt;ref name="Discourse Power and Access"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Dijk|first1=Teun|title=Discourse Power and Access|url=http://www.discourses.org/OldArticles/Discourse,%20power%20and%20access.pdf|website=discourse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those with power and influence know that media control or influence is crucial. A free press is crucial for a functioning democracy, but if not truly free, paves the way for manipulation and concentration of views, thus undermining democracy itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shah|first1=Anup|title=Media in the United States|url=http://www.globalissues.org/article/163/media-in-the-united-states|website=Global Issues|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First Amendment to the U.S Constitution, which provides that "Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press," has given the media an exceptionally strong basis for resisting government controls in the United States. A limited number of controls, such as regulatory laws, court decisions, and informational social pressures guard against excess by the media. In the United States courts have been loath to impose restraints prior to publication, such as granting injunctions that would stop publication of information on the grounds that it would cause irreparable harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graber|first1=Doris|last2=Dunaway|first2=Johanna|title=Mass media and American politics|date=2015|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781452287287|edition=9th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

These media conglomerates control 90% of the traditional media that is present in our daily lives, media has never been more consolidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lutz|first1=Ashley|title=These 6 Corporations Control 90% of the Media in America|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6|website=Business Insider|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power of media versus reality==
The shaping of ones reality or perception is based on three elements including experienced reality, symbolic reality, and socially constructed reality. Much of the symbolic reality is based on media practices that we are exposed to daily. Individuals make assumptions on the world based on what their media tells them. The media is a [[hegemony|hegemonic]] form of power that maintains their position, not through force, but through elaboration of a particular world view, an ideology, or a particular notion of common sense, which is widely infused into everyday cultural practices. This results in people consenting to power even when it may not be in their best interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bybee|first1=Carl|title=Mass Media and Society|url=http://journalism.uoregon.edu/~cbybee/j201/overheads/hegemony_def.htm|website=University of Oregon - Journalism Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of media hegemony is that the ideas of the ruling class become ruling ideas in society, because of this the mass media are controlled by the dominant class in society which uses it as a vehicle for exerting control over the rest of society.&lt;ref name="Discourse Power and Access"/&gt;

=== Socially constructed reality ===
[[Social constructionism|Social construct]] examines the development of jointly constructed understandings of the world. It assumes that understanding, significance, and meaning are developed not separately within the individual, but in coordination among other human beings. To say something that it is socially constructed is to emphasize its dependence on contingent aspects of an individuals social selves. It can say this thing could not have existed had we not built it. Had someone been brought up in a different kind of society, had different needs, values, or interests, an individual might have built a different kind of thing, or built this social construct differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boghossian|first1=Paul|title=What is Social Construction?|url=http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/1153/socialconstruction.pdf|website=New York University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to be aware that the values we hold, the beliefs we harbor and the decisions we make are based on our assumptions, our experiences, our education and what we know for a fact. Social construct allows us rely on mass media for the current news and facts about what is important and what we should be aware of.  We trust the media as an authority for news, information, education and entertainment. Considering that powerful influence, then, we should know how it really works. The degree of influence depends on the availability and pervasiveness of media.  Traditional mass media still has a great influence within society today. Books once were supremely influential because they came first before newspapers, magazines, radio or television. Newspapers and magazines became large influencers after they were developed. Sound recordings and film were and still are influential. Radio and then television were very influential. As the 20th century closed, TV exposed us to a number of new examples advertising and marketing, suffering and relief, sexuality and violence, celebrity entertainment, and much more. New and influential media-distribution channels have appeared in the 21st century. We are currently being influenced through the internet by daily by blogs, popular culture websites and various social media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=A|title=Mass Media Influence on Society|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Media&amp;Society/MassMediaInfluenceOnSociety.html|website=University of North Carolina Pembroke|accessdate=27 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215065257/http://www.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Media%26Society/MassMediaInfluenceOnSociety.html|archivedate=15 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experienced reality===
Experienced reality is that reality that comes to us via the senses and also via insight or intuition. It underlies all of our cognitive efforts. Because direct experience is largely sensory, automatic and constant, we pay less attention to it than the reality we have to work at to construct. It is somewhat of an illusion that effort equates to importance in our culture.&lt;ref name="Guide to Reality"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baggott|first1=Jim|title=A beginner's guide to reality : [exploring our everyday adventures in wonderland]|date=2006|publisher=Pegasus books|location=New York|isbn=9781933648040|edition=1st Pegasus Books}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Events or experiences spark change in an individual. Through societal influence we are becoming a generation that needs to see to believe, and experienced reality is what initiates this idea. Power through this idea of experienced reality is relayed through the ideologies of the major media conglomerates and the way that they have created such a large cultural bias towards what we have experienced.

===Symbolic reality===
Symbols exist everywhere for an individual. Symbols are the intermediary between the world internal and the world external, between inner and external reality of human being as a person. The appeal to symbolic reality allows us to overcome [[personal boundaries]] including power struggles. Symbolic reality exists in and through person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ekaterina|first1=Dr. Dvoretskaya|title=Personal approach to Symbolic reality|url=http://www.crvp.org/seminar/05-seminar/Ekaterina.htm|website=Council for Research in Values and Philosophy|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols are objects, characters, or other representations of ideas, concepts, or abstractions; they are the universal language in a culture. Symbols have been used for thousands of years, they help individuals communicate and interact with one another. Thus, as a representation, their meaning is neither instinctive nor automatic. The culture’s members must interpret, and over time reinterpret, Symbols convey meaning and occur in different forms, such as: verbal or nonverbal, written or unwritten, words on the page, drawings, pictures, gesture. They are things which act as triggers to remind people, in the culture, of its rules, beliefs… Symbols can also be used to indicate status within a culture. Every society has evolved a system of symbols that reflects a specific cultural logic; and every symbolism functions to communicate information between members in much the same way as, but more subtly than, conventional language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Power of Symbols|url=http://bizshifts-trends.com/2012/01/23/power-of-symbols-symbolisms-and-brand-in-developing-global-markets-anthropology-of-business-marketing-leadership/|website=Business Shifts and Trends|accessdate=5 May 2015|date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the level of power, media conglomerates have been using symbolic reality to relay their messages for years.

[[File:Solar Spectrum.png|240px|right|thumb|Spectrum of sunlight above the atmosphere (yellow) and at sea level (red), revealing an absorption spectrum with a discrete part (such as the line due to {{chem|O|2}}) and a continuous part (such as the bands labeled {{chem|H|2|O}}).]]

A [[observable|physical quantity]] is said to have a '''discrete spectrum''' if it takes only distinct values, with gaps between one value and the next.

The classical example of discrete spectrum (for which the term was first used) is the characteristic set of discrete [[spectral line]]s seen in the [[emission spectrum]] and [[absorption spectrum]] of isolated [[atom]]s of a [[chemical element]], which only absorb and emit light at particular [[wavelength]]s. The technique of [[spectroscopy]] is based on this phenomenon.

Discrete spectra are contrasted with the [[continuous spectrum (physics)|continuous spectra]] also seen in such experiments, for example in [[thermal emission]], in [[synchrotron radiation]], and many other light-producing phenomena.

[[File:Oh No Girl Spectrogram.jpg|240px|right|thumb|[[Acoustic spectrogram]] of the words "Oh, no!" said by a young girl, showing how the discrete{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} spectrum of the sound (bright orange lines) changes with time (the horizontal axis).]]
Discrete spectra are seen in many other phenomena, such as vibrating [[string (music)|string]]s, [[microwave]]s in a [[microwave cavity|metal cavity]], [[sound wave]]s in a [[pulsating star]], and [[resonance (particle physics)|resonances]] in high-energy [[particle physics]].

The general phenomenon of discrete spectra in physical systems can be mathematically modeled with tools of [[functional analysis]], specifically by the [[decomposition of spectrum (functional analysis)|decomposition of the spectrum]] of a [[linear operator]] acting on a [[functional space]].

==Origins of discrete spectra==

=== Classical mechanics ===
In [[classical mechanics]], discrete spectra are often associated to [[wave]]s and [[oscillation]]s in a bounded object or domain.  Mathematically they can be identified with the [[eigenvalue]]s of [[differential operator]]s that describe the evolution of some continuous variable (such as [[deformation (mechanics)|strain]] or [[pressure]]) as a function of time and/or space.

Discrete spectra are also produced by some [[non-linear oscillator]]s where the relevant quantity has a non-[[sinusoid]]al [[waveform]].  Notable examples are the sound produced by the [[vocal chord]]s of mammals.&lt;ref name=pulak&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.684}} and the [[stridulation]] organs of [[cricket]]s,&lt;ref name=popov&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; whose spectrum shows a series of strong lines at frequencies that are integer multiples ([[harmonic]]s) of the [[fundamental frequency|oscillation frequency]].

A related phenomenon is the appearance of strong harmonics when a sinusoidal signal (which has the ultimate "discrete spectrum", consisting of a single spectral line) is modified by a non-linear [[filter (signal processing)|filter]]; for example, when a [[pure tone]] is played through an overloaded [[amplifier]],&lt;ref name=klip&gt;
  Paul V. Klipsch (1969), [http://www.elpee.info/Documenten/KlipschVervorming.pdf ''Modulation distortion in loudspeakers''] Journal of the Audio Engineering Society.
&lt;/ref&gt; or when an intense [[monochromatic]] [[laser]] beam goes through a [[non-linear optics|non-linear medium]].&lt;ref&gt;
  J. A. Armstrong, N. Bloembergen J. Ducuing, and P. S. Pershan (1962), [http://prola.aps.org/pdf/PR/v127/i6/p1918_1 Interactions between Light Waves in a Nonlinear Dielectric''].  Physical Review, volume 127, issue 6, pages 1918–1939. {{doi|10.1103/PhysRev.127.1918}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In the latter case, if two arbitrary sinusoidal signals with frequencies ''f'' and ''g'' are processed together, the output signal will generally have spectral lines at frequencies |''mf'' + ''ng''| where ''m'' and ''n'' are any integers.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
{{main|Spectrum (functional analysis) #Point spectrum}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], the discrete spectrum of an observable corresponds to the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[operator (physics)|operator]] used to model that observable.  According to the [[functional analysis|mathematical theory of such operators]], its eigenvalues are a discrete set of [[isolated point]]s, which may be either [[finite set|finite]] or [[countable set|countable]].

Discrete spectra are usually associated with systems that are [[bound state|bound]] in some sense (mathematically, confined to a [[compact space]]).  The [[position operator|position]] and [[momentum operator]]s have continuous spectra in an infinite domain, but a discrete (quantized) spectrum in a compact domain &lt;ref name=LL&gt;L. D. Landau, E. M. Lifshitz,  [https://archive.org/details/QuantumMechanics_104 Quantum Mechanics ( Volume 3 of A Course of Theoretical Physics ) Pergamon Press 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;  and the same properties of spectra hold for [[angular momentum]], [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonians]] and other operators of  quantum  systems.&lt;ref name= LL /&gt;

The [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] and the [[hydrogen atom]] are examples of physical systems in which the Hamiltonian has a discrete spectrum. In the case of the hydrogen atom the spectrum has both a continuous and a discrete part, the continuous part representing the [[ionization]].

DR is notable in the history of [[role-playing games]] for being one of the first RPGs to be released under an [[open source]] (or [[open gaming]]) licence, known as the [[Dominion Rules Licence]].&lt;ref&gt;John Munsch, "Making Sure An Open Source RPG Stays Available": {{cite web |url=http://www.johnmunsch.com/2006/09/making_sure_a_open_source_rpg.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625084400/http://www.johnmunsch.com/2006/09/making_sure_a_open_source_rpg.html |archivedate=2008-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of the game followed an open source model whereby contributors, known as the Dominion Games Development Team,&lt;ref&gt;See "The Dominion Games Interview" (November 2000) at http://www.guildcompanion.com/scrolls/2000/nov/dginterview.html&lt;/ref&gt; made improvements or additions to the game and published them on the internet (often through the Dominion Games web site) under the terms of the Dominion Rules Licence, thus explicitly encouraging the creation of new skills, spells, beasts and rules by its modular structure in an attempt to establish an equivalent to the Open Source Software model in RPG gaming.

== Game Mechanic==
DR is a skills-based [[role-playing game system]] based on the twelve-sided die (d12). The game mechanic is the same for almost all actions: players roll d12 trying to roll less than or equal to the applicable skill stat, as modified by any applicable bonuses or penalties. For example, a character seeking to strike an opponent with his weapon begins with his Strike stat, adds to it the Strike bonus applicable to his weapon, and subtracts from that any defensive penalties imposed by his opponent's defensive manoeuvres and armour. A roll of 12 always fails. In many cases, a roll of 12 has particularly negative results. 

DR is designed around three major skill types, namely combat skills, priestcraft skills and witchcraft skills. All characters have access to combat skills. Priest-style characters have access to priest-specific skills such as bless, consecrate, curse, defile, heal, smite, wrath, and work miracle. Magic-using characters may either cast pre-made spells or employ free-form magic, both of which are essentially another type of skill use.

== Game Setting==
The DR rules system is intended to be generic and does not describe the kind of world (or "campaign setting") to which they apply. The system can be used in a variety of RPG settings by excluding or modifying certain rules. For a historical setting, players simply disregard the priestcraft and witchcraft rules.

== Distribution==
Dominion Rules was one of the first RPGs to be released under an open source style (or open gaming style) licence, known as the [[Dominion Rules Licence]]. The current version of DR  is distributed under version 2.0 of the [[Dominion Rules Licence]]. 

The current version of DR is free to download from http://www.dominionrules.org. Copies of the previous versions can be found in various places on the internet.

== History ==
DR 1.0 appeared in 1999. It was revised and republished as version 2.0 in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"Dominion Rules 2.0" (game review) at http://www.guildcompanion.com/scrolls/2001/dec/reviewdominionrules2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Both versions were distributed by [[Dominion Games]]. No retail, print versions of the game were published. DR 2.0 received some favourable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, "Review of Dominion Rules Digest 2.0": http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9525.phtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominion Games and their web site disappeared around 2006. The creators of the Dominion Rules released version 3.0 in April 2008 from  http://www.dominionrules.org to favourable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, "Dominion Rules by MAB": http://thefreerpgblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/dominion-rules-by-mab.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''Eckmann–Hilton argument''' (or '''Eckmann–Hilton principle''' or '''Eckmann–Hilton theorem''') is an [[argument]] about two [[monoid]] [[structure (category theory)|structure]]s on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] where one is a [[homomorphism]] for the other. Given this, the structures can be shown to coincide, and the resulting [[monoid]] demonstrated to be [[commutative]]. This can then be used to prove the commutativity of the higher [[homotopy group]]s. The principle is named after [[Beno Eckmann]] and [[Peter Hilton]], who used it in a 1962 paper.

==The Eckmann–Hilton result==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a set equipped with two [[Binary operation|binary operations]], which we will write &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;, and suppose:

# &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; are both [[unital algebra|unital]].&lt;br /&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(a \otimes b) \circ (c \otimes d) = (a \circ c) \otimes (b \circ d)&lt;/math&gt; for all  &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,d \in X &lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; are the same and in fact commutative and associative.

===Remarks===
The operations &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; are often referred to as multiplications, but this might imply they are associative, a property which is not required for the proof. In fact, associativity follows. Likewise, we do not have to require that the two operations have the same neutral element; this is a consequence.

==Proof==
First, observe that the units of the two operations coincide:
&lt;math&gt; 1_\circ = 1_\circ \circ 1_\circ
               = (1_{\otimes} \otimes 1_\circ) \circ (1_\circ \otimes 1_\otimes)
               = (1_\otimes \circ 1_\circ) \otimes (1_\circ \circ 1_\otimes)
               = 1_\otimes \otimes 1_\otimes
               = 1_\otimes&lt;/math&gt;.
 
Now, let &lt;math&gt;a,b \in X&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;a \circ b = (1 \otimes a) \circ (b \otimes 1)
                     = (1 \circ b) \otimes (a \circ 1)
                     = b \otimes a
                     = (b \circ 1) \otimes (1 \circ a)
                     = (b \otimes 1) \circ (1 \otimes a)
                     = b \circ a&lt;/math&gt;. This establishes that the two operations coincide and are commutative.

For associativity, &lt;math&gt;(a \otimes b) \otimes c = (a \otimes b) \otimes (1 \otimes c) = (a \otimes 1) \otimes (b \otimes c) = a \otimes (b \otimes c)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Remarks ==
If the operations are associative, each one defines the structure of a monoid on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and the conditions above are equivalent to the more abstract condition that &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; is a monoid homomorphism &lt;math&gt;(X,\circ)\times(X,\circ)\to(X,\circ)&lt;/math&gt; (or vice versa). An even more abstract way of stating the theorem is: If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[monoid object]] in the [[category of monoids]], then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is in fact a commutative monoid.

It is important that a similar argument does NOT give such a triviality result in the case of monoid objects in the categories of small categories or of groupoids. Instead the notion of group object in the category of [[groupoid]]s turns out to be equivalent to the notion of [[crossed module]]. This leads to the idea of using multiple groupoid objects in homotopy theory. 

More generally, the Eckmann–Hilton argument is a special case of the use of the [[interchange law]] in the theory of (strict) double and multiple categories. A (strict) [[double category]] is a set, or class, equipped with two category structures, each of which is a morphism for the other structure. If the compositions in the two category structures are written &lt;math&gt;\circ, \otimes&lt;/math&gt; then the interchange law reads 
:&lt;math&gt; (a \circ b) \otimes (c \circ d) = (a \otimes c) \circ (b \otimes d)&lt;/math&gt;
whenever both sides are defined. For an example of its use, and some discussion, see the paper of Higgins referenced below. The interchange law implies that a double category contains a family of abelian monoids. 

The history in relation to [[homotopy group]]s is interesting. The workers in topology of the early 20th century were aware that the nonabelian [[fundamental group]] was of use in geometry and analysis; that abelian [[Homology (mathematics)|homology groups]] could be defined in all dimensions; and that for a connected space, the first homology group was the fundamental group [[Abelianisation|made abelian]]. So there was a desire to generalise the nonabelian fundamental group to all dimensions. 

In 1932, [[Eduard Čech]] submitted a paper on higher [[Homotopy group|homotopy groups]] to the International Congress of Mathematics at Zurich. However, [[Pavel Alexandrov|Pavel Alexandroff]] and [[Heinz Hopf]] quickly proved these groups were abelian for &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, and on these grounds persuaded Cech to withdraw his paper, so that only a small paragraph appeared in the ''Proceedings''. It is said that [[Witold Hurewicz]] attended this conference, and his first work on higher homotopy groups appeared in 1935.{{cn|date=May 2013}} Thus the dreams of the early topologists have long been regarded as a mirage.{{cn|date=May 2013}} 

Cubical higher homotopy groupoids are constructed  for filtered spaces in the book ''[http://pages.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html Nonabelian algebraic topology]'' cited below, which develops basic algebraic topology, including higher analogues to the [[Seifert–van Kampen theorem|Seifert-van Kampen theorem]], without using [[singular homology]] or simplicial approximation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1103">'''Extrinsic finality''' is a principle of the [[philosophy]] of [[teleology]] that holds that a being has a final cause or purpose external to that being itself, in contrast to an [[intrinsic finality]], or self-contained purpose.
One example is the view that [[mineral]]s are "designed" to be used by [[plant]]s that are in turn "designed" to be used by [[animal]]s.

Over-emphasizing extrinsic finality is often criticized as leading to the anthropic attribution of every event to a divine purpose, or superstition. For instance, "If I hadn't been at the store today, I wouldn't have found that $100 on the ground. God must have intended for me to go to the store so I would find that money." or "We won the game today because of my lucky socks." Such abuses were criticized by [[Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref&gt;"De Dignitate et Augmentis Scientiarum," III, iv&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descartes]], &lt;ref&gt;"Principia Philosophiæ", I, 28; III, 2, 3; "Meditationes", III, IV&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;Ethica, I, prop. 36 app.)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7262">In [[Riemannian geometry]], the '''fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry''' states that on any [[Riemannian manifold]] (or [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]) there is a unique [[torsion (differential geometry)|torsion-free]] metric [[affine connection|connection]], called the '''[[Levi-Civita connection]]''' of the given metric. Here a '''metric''' (or '''Riemannian''') connection is a connection which preserves the [[metric tensor]]. More precisely:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Fundamental Theorem of Riemannian Geometry.''' Let (''M'', ''g'') be a [[Riemannian manifold]] (or [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]). Then there is a unique connection ∇ which satisfies the following conditions:
*for any vector fields ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' we have 
::&lt;math&gt;\partial_X \langle Y,Z \rangle = \langle \nabla_X Y,Z  \rangle + \langle Y,\nabla_X Z \rangle,&lt;/math&gt; 
:where &lt;math&gt; \partial_X \langle Y,Z \rangle &lt;/math&gt; denotes the derivative of the function &lt;math&gt; \langle Y,Z \rangle &lt;/math&gt; along vector field ''X''.
*for any vector fields ''X'', ''Y'', 
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla_XY-\nabla_YX=[X,Y],&lt;/math&gt; 
:where [''X'', ''Y''] denotes the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] for [[vector field]]s ''X'', ''Y''. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first condition means that the metric tensor is preserved by [[parallel transport]], while the second condition expresses the fact that the [[torsion (differential geometry)|torsion]] of ∇ is zero.

An extension of the fundamental theorem states that given a pseudo-Riemannian manifold there is a unique connection preserving the [[metric tensor]] with any given vector-valued 2-form as its torsion. The difference between an arbitrary connection (with torsion) and the corresponding Levi-Civita connection is the [[contorsion tensor]].

The following technical proof presents a formula for [[Covariant derivative#Coordinate description|Christoffel symbol]]s of the connection in a local coordinate system. For a given metric this set of equations can become rather complicated. There are quicker and simpler methods to obtain the Christoffel symbols for a given metric, e.g. using the [[action (physics)|action]] integral and the associated Euler-Lagrange equations.

==Geodesics defined by a metric or a connection==

A [[metric tensor|metric]] defines the curves which are [[geodesic]]s ; but a [[affine connection|connection]] also defines the geodesics (see also [[Parallel transport#Recovering the connection from the parallel transport parallel|parallel transport]]). A connection &lt;math&gt;\bar{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be equal to another &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; in two different ways:&lt;ref&gt;[http://strangebeautiful.com/other-texts/spivak-intro-diff-geom-v2-3ed.pdf   spivak introduction to differential geometry, volume 2, 3rd edition, p.249]&lt;/ref&gt;
*obviously if &lt;math&gt;\bar{\nabla}_X Y = \nabla_X Y&lt;/math&gt; for every vectors fields &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt;
*if &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; define the same geodesics '''and''' have the same [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]
This means that two different connections can lead to the same geodesics while giving different results for some vector fields.

Because a metric also defines the geodesics of a differential manifold, for some metric there is not only one connection defining the same geodesics &lt;small&gt;(some examples can be found of a connection on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; leading to the straight lines as geodesics but having some torsion in contrary to the trivial connection on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the usual [[directional derivative]])&lt;/small&gt; , and given a metric, the only connection which defines the same geodesics (which leaves the metric unchanged by [[parallel transport]]) '''and''' which is [[torsion tensor|torsion-free]] is the [[Levi-Civita connection]] (which is obtained from the metric by differentiation).

==Proof of the theorem==
Let ''m'' be the dimension of ''M'' and, in some local chart, consider the standard coordinate vector fields

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial}_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}, \qquad i=1,\dots,m. &lt;/math&gt;

Locally, the entry ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the metric tensor is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;g_{i j} = \left \langle {\partial}_i, {\partial}_j \right \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

To specify the connection it is enough to specify, for all ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'',

:&lt;math&gt;\left \langle \nabla_{\partial_i}\partial_j, \partial_k \right \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

We also recall that, locally, a [[Covariant derivative#Coordinate description|connection]] is given by ''m''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; smooth functions

:&lt;math&gt;\left \{ \Gamma^l {}_{ij} \right \},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\partial_i} \partial_j = \sum_l \Gamma^l_{ij} \partial _l.&lt;/math&gt;

The torsion-free property means

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{ \partial _i} \partial _j = \nabla_{\partial_j} \partial_i.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, compatibility with the Riemannian metric implies that

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_k g_{ij}  =  \left \langle \nabla_{\partial_k}\partial_i, \partial_j \rangle + \langle \partial_i, \nabla_{\partial_k} \partial_j \right \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

For a fixed, ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'', permutation gives 3 equations with 6 unknowns. The torsion free assumption reduces the number of variables to 3. Solving the resulting system of 3 linear equations gives unique solutions

:&lt;math&gt;\left \langle \nabla_{ \partial_i }\partial_j, \partial_k \right \rangle  = \tfrac{1}{2} \left ( \partial_i g_{jk}- \partial_k g_{ij} + \partial_j g_{ik} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

This is the '''first Christoffel identity'''.

Since

:&lt;math&gt;\left \langle \nabla_{ \partial_i }\partial_j, \partial_k \right \rangle = \Gamma^l _{ij} g_{lk},&lt;/math&gt;

where we use Einstein summation convention.  That is, an index repeated [[subscript and superscript]] implies that it is summed over all values. Inverting the metric tensor gives the '''second Christoffel identity''':

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^l_{ij} = \tfrac{1}{2} \left ( \partial_i g_{jk}- \partial_k g_{ij} + \partial_j g_{ik} \right ) g^{kl}.&lt;/math&gt;

Once again, with Einstein summation convention.  The resulting unique connection is called the '''Levi-Civita connection'''.

==The Koszul formula==
An alternative proof of the Fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry proceeds by showing that a torsion-free metric connection on a Riemannian manifold is necessarily given by the '''Koszul formula''':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ll}2 g(\nabla_XY, Z) &amp;=\, \partial_X (g(Y,Z)) + \partial_Y (g(X,Z)) - \partial_Z (g(X,Y)) \\&amp;\quad+\, g([X,Y],Z) - g([X,Z],Y) - g([Y,Z],X).\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

This proves the uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection. Existence is proven by showing that this expression is tensorial in ''X'' and ''Z'', satisfies the Leibniz rule in ''Y'', and that hence defines a connection. This is a metric connection, because the symmetric part of the formula in ''Y'' and ''Z'' is the first term on the first line; it is torsion-free because the anti-symmetric part of the formula in ''X'' and ''Y'' is the first term on the second line.

[[File:GanttChartAnatomy.svg|right|thumb|A Gantt chart showing three kinds of schedule dependencies (in red) and percent complete indications.]]
A '''Gantt chart''' is a type of [[bar chart]] that illustrates a [[schedule (project management)|project schedule]], named after its inventor, [[Henry Gantt]] (1861–1919), who designed such a chart around the years 1910–1915.{{sfn|Gantt|1910}}{{sfn|Morris|1997|p=7}} Modern Gantt charts also show the [[Dependency (project management)|dependency]] relationships between activities and current schedule status.

== Definition ==
A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}{{sfn|Richman|2002|pp=97, 117, 276}} that illustrates a project schedule.&lt;ref name="Kumar 2005 pp. 13–21"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumar |first=Pankaja Pradeep |title=Effective Use of Gantt Chart for Managing Large Scale Projects |journal=Cost Engineering |publisher=American Association of Cost Engineers |publication-place=Morgantown, WV |volume=47 |issue=7 |year=2005 |oclc=209778284 |issn=0274-9696 |pages=13–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chart lists the tasks to be performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis.{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}{{sfn|Richman|2002|pp=117, 276}} The width of the horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity.{{sfn|Richman|2002|pp=117, 276}}{{sfn|Selig|2008|p=235}} Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a [[project]]. Terminal elements and summary elements constitute the [[work breakdown structure]] of the project. Modern Gantt charts also show the [[Dependency (project management)|dependency]] (i.e., precedence network) relationships between activities. Gantt charts can be used to show current schedule status using percent-complete shadings and a vertical "TODAY" line as shown here.

Gantt charts are sometimes equated with bar charts.{{sfn|Selig|2008|p=235}}{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=236|loc=Chapter 12}}

Gantt charts are usually created initially using an ''early start time approach'', where each task is scheduled to start immediately when its prerequisites are complete. This method maximizes the [[Float (project management)|float time]] available for all tasks.{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}

== Historical development ==

Although now regarded as a common charting technique, Gantt charts were considered revolutionary when first introduced.{{sfn|Wilson|2003}} The first known tool of this type was developed in 1896 by [[Karol Adamiecki]], who called it a ''harmonogram''.{{sfn|Marsh|1974|p=32}} Adamiecki did not publish his chart until 1931, however, and only in Polish, which limited both its adoption and recognition of his authorship.

In 1912, {{ill|Hermann Schürch|de}} published what would be considered Gantt charts while discussing a construction project. It appears that Schürch's charts were not notable but rather routine in Germany at the time they were published.{{sfn|Weaver|2012a|pp=5–6}}{{sfn|Weaver|2012b|pp=4–6}}{{sfn|Weaver|2017|pp=6–7}} The prior development leading to Schürch's work is unknown.{{sfn|Weaver|2017|p=7}} Unlike later Gantt charts, Schürch's charts did not display interdependencies, leaving them to be inferred by the reader. These were also static representations of a planned schedule.{{sfn|Weaver|2017|p=6}}

The chart is named after [[Henry Gantt]] (1861–1919), who designed his chart around the years 1910–1915.{{sfn|Gantt|1910}}{{sfn|Morris|1997|p=7}}

One of the first major applications of Gantt charts was by the United States during [[World War I]], at the instigation of [[William Crozier (artillerist)|General William Crozier]].{{sfn|Clark|1922}}

The earliest Gantt charts were drawn on paper and therefore had to be redrawn entirely in order to adjust to schedule changes. For many years, project managers used pieces of paper or blocks for Gantt chart bars so they could be adjusted as needed.{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=281|loc=Chapter 14}} Gantt's collaborator, [[Walter Polakov]] introduced Gantt charts to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1929 when he was working for the [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy]]. They were used in developing the [[First Five Year Plan]], supplying Russian translations to explain their use.&lt;ref name ="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, D. J. (2004) "[https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=artspapers Marxist Manager Amidst the Progressives: Walter N. Polakov and the Taylor Society]", ''Journal of Industrial History'', 6(2), November 2004, 61-75&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Olson |first1=Richard G. |title=Scientism and Technocracy in the Twentieth Century: The Legacy of Scientific Management |date=2015 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9781498525718 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BFzpCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=Technocracy+Russia+Polakov&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MFPxEkfYYf&amp;sig=t0eKfWS2S3OJOOjPm9cHhehimb8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiW_57gsNbdAhUkDMAKHTbSDRAQ6AEwA3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Technocracy%20Russia%20Polakov&amp;f=false |accessdate=25 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, personal computers allowed widespread creation of complex and elaborate Gantt charts. The first desktop applications were intended mainly for project managers and project schedulers. With the advent of the Internet and increased collaboration over networks at the end of the 1990s, Gantt charts became a common feature of web-based applications, including collaborative [[groupware]].{{cn|date=January 2018}} By 2012, almost all Gantt charts were made by software which can easily adjust to schedule changes.{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=281|loc=Chapter 14}}

In 1999, Gantt charts were identified as "one of the most widely used management tools for project scheduling and control".{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}

== Example ==
In the following table there are seven tasks, labeled ''a'' through ''g''. Some tasks can be done concurrently (''a'' and ''b'') while others cannot be done until their predecessor task is complete (''c'' and ''d'' cannot begin until ''a'' is complete). Additionally, each task has three time estimates: the optimistic time estimate (''O''), the most likely or normal time estimate (''M''), and the pessimistic time estimate (''P''). The expected time (''T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'') is estimated using the [[Beta distribution#Project management: task cost and schedule modeling|beta probability distribution]] for the time estimates, using the formula (''O''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4''M''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''P'')&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;6.

Once this step is complete, one can draw a Gantt chart or a network diagram.

:[[File:pert example gantt chart.gif|frame|none|A Gantt chart created using [[Microsoft Project]] (MSP).  Note (1) the [[critical path method|critical path]] is in red, (2) the [[Float (project management)|slack]] is the black lines connected to non-critical activities, (3) since Saturday and Sunday are not work days and are thus excluded from the schedule, some bars on the Gantt chart are longer if they cut through a weekend.]]

== Progress Gantt charts ==
In a progress Gantt chart, tasks are shaded in proportion to the degree of their completion: a task that is 60% complete would be 60% shaded, starting from the left. A vertical line is drawn at the time index when the progress Gantt chart is created, and this line can then be compared with shaded tasks. If everything is on schedule, all task portions left of the line will be shaded, and all task portions right of the line will not be shaded. This provides a visual representation of how the project and its tasks are ahead or behind schedule.{{sfn|Klein|1999|pp=56–57}}

== Linked Gantt charts ==
''Linked Gantt charts'' contain lines indicating the dependencies between tasks. However, linked Gantt charts quickly become cluttered in all but the simplest cases. [[Critical path network diagram]]s are superior to visually communicate the relationships between tasks.{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=239|loc=Chapter 12}} However, Gantt charts are often preferred over network diagrams because Gantt charts are easily interpreted without training, whereas critical path diagrams require training to interpret.{{sfn|Flouris|Lock|2012|p=236|loc=Chapter 12}} Gantt chart software typically provides mechanisms to link task dependencies, although this data may or may not be visually represented.{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}} Gantt charts and network diagrams are often used for the same project, both being generated from the same data by a software application.{{sfn|Klein|1999|p=49}}

{{Governance}}
'''Governance''' comprises all of the processes of governing - whether undertaken by the [[government]] of a [[state (polity) | state]], by a [[market (economics) |market]] or by a [[social network| network]] - over a [[social system]] ([[family]], [[tribe]], [[formal organization |formal]] or [[informal organization]], a [[territory]] or across territories) and whether through the [[laws]], [[norm (social) |norm]]s, [[political power|power]] or [[language]] of an organized society.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite book |last= Bevir |first= Mark |title= Governance: A very short introduction |year= 2012 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford, UK | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ozjcWIfhoO8C | quote = Governance refers, therefore, to all processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, market, or network, whether over a family, tribe, formal or informal organization, or territory, and whether through laws, norms, power or language. Governance differs from government in that it focuses less on the state and its institutions and more on social practices and activities. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It relates to "the processes of interaction and decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem that lead to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of [[social norm]]s and [[institution]]s".&lt;ref name="Hufty 2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In lay terms, it could be described as the political processes that exist in and between formal institutions.

A variety of entities (known generically as '''governing bodies''') can govern. The most formal is a '''government''', a body whose sole responsibility and authority is to make binding decisions in a given [[geopolitical]] system (such as a [[sovereign state|state]]) by establishing [[law]]s. Other types of governing include an organization (such as a [[corporation]] recognized as a legal entity by a government), a socio-political group ([[chiefdom]], tribe, [[gang]], family, [[religious denomination]], etc.), or another, informal [[social group | group]] of people. In [[business sector | business]] and [[outsourcing]] relationships, [[Governance Frameworks|governance frameworks]] are built{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} into [[relational contract]]s that foster long-term collaboration and innovation.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Governance is the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained, regulated and held [[accountability |accountable]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} The degree of formality depends on the internal rules of a given [[organization]] and, externally, with its [[business partner]]s. As such, governance may take many forms, driven by many different motivations and with many different results. For instance, a government may operate as a [[democracy]] where citizens vote on who should govern and the [[public good]] is the goal, while a [[non-profit organization]] or a [[corporation]] may be governed by a small [[board of directors]] and pursue more specific aims.

In addition, a variety of external actors without decision-making power can influence the process of governing. These include [[lobbying |lobbies]], [[think tanks]], [[political parties]], [[non-government organizations]] , community and [[Media (communication) | media]].

==Origin of the word==
{{Disputed section|Origins of the word|date=August 2016}}
Like ''government'', the word ''governance'' derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb kubernaein [''kubernáo''] (meaning ''to steer'', the metaphorical sense first being attested in [[Plato]]). Its occasional use in English to refer to the specific activity of ruling a country can be traced to early modern England, when the phrase "governance of the realm" appears in works by [[William Tyndale]]&lt;ref name="TyndaleFrith1831"&gt;"When the king's grace came first to the right of the crown, and unto the governance of the realm young and unexpert..." {{cite book|author1=William Tyndale|author2=John Frith|title=The works of Tyndale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qoMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA452|year=1831|publisher=Ebenezer Palmer|page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in royal correspondence between [[James V of Scotland]] and [[Henry VIII of England]].&lt;ref&gt;"We have put all our confidence, has als actyflie with ye help of our derrest Modir takin on Ws ye governance of our Realme": {{cite book|title=State Papers: King Henry the Eighth; Part IV.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hs0_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA95|year=1836|publisher=Murray|page=95|chapter=Letter of James V to Henry VIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first usage in connection with institutional structures (as distinct from individual rule) is in [[Charles Plummer]]’s ''The Governance of England'' (an 1885 translation from a 15th-century Latin work by [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]], also known as ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy''). This usage of governance to refer to the arrangements of governing became orthodox including in [[Sidney Low]]’s seminal text of the same title in 1904 and among some later British constitutional historians.

However, the use of the term ''governance'' in its current broader sense, encompassing the activities of a wide range of public and private institutions, acquired general currency only as recently as the 1990s, when it was re-minted by economists and political scientists and disseminated by institutions such as the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/governance/docs/doc5_fr.pdf Étymologie du terme "gouvernance"], document prepared by the [[European Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term has steadily gained increasing usage.

==Types==
Governance often refers to a particular 'level' of governance associated with a type of organization (including public governance, global governance, non-profit governance, corporate governance, and project governance), a particular 'field' of governance associated with a type of activity or outcome (including environmental governance, internet governance, and information technology governance), or a particular 'model' of governance, often derived as an empirical or normative theory (including regulatory governance, participatory governance, multilevel governance, metagovernance, and collaborative governance).

Governance can also define normative or practical agendas. Normative concepts of fair governance or good governance are common among [[Politics|political]], [[public sector]], [[Volunteering|voluntary]], and [[private sector]] organizations.

===Governance as process===
{{Unreferenced section|date = December 2013}}In its most abstract sense, governance is a theoretical concept referring to the actions and processes by which stable practices and organizations arise and persist. These actions and processes may operate in formal and informal organizations of any size; and they may function for any purpose, good or evil, for profit or not. Conceiving of governance in this way, one can apply the concept to [[State (polity)|states]], to [[corporation]]s, to [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]]s, to [[NGO]]s, to partnerships and other associations, to business relationships (especially complex [[outsourcing]] relationships), to [[project team]]s, and to any number of humans engaged in some purposeful activity.

Most theories of governance as process arose out of [[neoclassical economics]]. These theories build deductive models, based on the assumptions of modern economics, to show how rational actors may come to establish and sustain formal organizations, including firms and states, and informal organizations, such as networks and practices for governing the commons. Many of these theories draw on [[transaction cost]] economics.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1979) "Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations," ''Journal of Law and Economics'': Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public governance===
{{main|Public administration}}
There is a distinction between the concepts of governance and [[politics]]. Politics involves processes by which a group of people (perhaps with divergent opinions or interests) reach collective decisions generally regarded as binding on the group, and enforced as common [[policy]]. Governance, on the other hand, conveys the [[Public administration|administrative]] and process-oriented elements of governing rather than its antagonistic ones.&lt;ref&gt;Offe, Claus, (2009) Governance: An “Empty Signifier”? ''Constellations,'' 16: 550–62. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-8675.2009.00570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an argument continues to assume the possibility of the traditional separation between "politics" and "administration". Contemporary governance practice and theory sometimes questions this distinction, premising that both "governance" and "politics" involve aspects of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[accountability]].

In general terms, public governance occurs in three broad ways:
* Through networks involving [[public-private partnership]]s (PPP) or with the collaboration of community organisations;
* Through the use of [[Market (economics)|market]] mechanisms whereby market principles of competition serve to allocate resources while operating under government regulation;
* Through top-down methods that primarily involve governments and the state [[bureaucracy]].

===Private governance===
Private governance occurs when non-governmental entities, including private organizations, [[dispute resolution organizations]], or other third party groups, make rules and/or standards which have a binding effect on the "quality of life and opportunities of the larger public."  Simply put, private—not public—entities are making [[public policy]]. For example, insurance companies exert a great societal impact, largely invisible and freely accepted, that is a private form of governance in society; in turn, reinsurers, as private companies, may exert similar private governance over their underlying carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Marcos Antonio Mendoza, "Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions", 21 Conn. Ins. L.J. 53, 68–70 (2014) http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2573253&lt;/ref&gt; The term "public policy" should not be exclusively associated with policy that is made by [[government]]. Public policy may be created by either the private sector or the public sector. If one wishes to refer only to public policy that is made by government, the best term to use is "governmental policy," which eliminates the ambiguity regarding the agent of the policy making.

===Global governance===
{{main|Global governance}}
Global governance is defined as "the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, right and obligations are established, and differences are mediated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thakur|first1=Ramesh|last2=Van Langenhove|first2=Luk|title=Enhancing Global Governance through Regional Integration|journal=Global Governance|date=2006|volume=12|issue=3 July, September|pages=233–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the traditional meaning of "governance", some authors like [[James Rosenau]] have used the term "global governance" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority.&lt;ref&gt;James N. Rosenau, "Toward an Ontology for Global Governance", in Martin Hewson and Thomas Sinclair, eds., ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'', SUNY Press, Albany, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The best example of this is the international system or relationships between independent states. The term, however, can apply wherever a group of free equals needs to form a regular relationship.

===Governance Analytical Framework===
The Governance Analytical Framework (GAF) is a practical methodology for investigating governance processes, where various stakeholders interact and make decisions regarding collective issues, thus creating or reinforcing social norms and institutions. It is postulated that governance processes can be found in any society, and unlike other approaches, that these can be observed and analysed from a non-[[normative]] perspective. It proposes a methodology based on five main analytical units: problems, actors, norms, processes and "nodal points". These logically articulated analytical units make up a coherent methodology aimed at being used as a tool for empirical [[social policy]] research.&lt;ref name="Hufty 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hufty |first=Marc |title=Governance: Exploring four approaches and their relevance to research. In: Wiesmann, U., Hurni, H., et al. editors. Research for Sustainable Development: Foundations, Experiences, and Perspectives. |year=2011 |location=Bern |publisher=Geographica Bernensia: 165–183.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spear, Cornforth &amp; Aiken, 2009. The governance challenges of social enterprises: Evidence from a UK empirical study. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 89(2): 247–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonprofit governance===
Nonprofit governance has a dual focus: achieving the organization's social mission and the ensuring the organization is viable. Both responsibilities relate to fiduciary responsibility that a board of trustees (sometimes called directors, or Board, or Management Committee—the terms are interchangeable) has with respect to the exercise of authority over the explicit actions the organization takes. Public trust and accountability is an essential aspect of organizational viability so it achieves the social mission in a way that is respected by those whom the organization serves and the society in which it is located.

===Corporate governance===
{{main|Corporate governance}}
[[Corporation|Corporate organizations]] often use the word ''governance'' to describe both:
# The manner in which [[Board of directors|board]]s or their like direct a corporation
# The laws and customs (rules) applying to that direction

Corporate governance consists of the set of processes, customs, policies, laws and institutions affecting the way people direct, administer or control a corporation. Corporate governance also includes the relationships among the many players involved (the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]) and the corporate [[goal]]s. The principal players include the [[shareholder]]s, [[management]], and the [[board of directors]]. Other stakeholders include employees, suppliers, customers, banks and other lenders, regulators, the environment and the community at large.

The first documented use of the word "corporate governance" is by Richard Eells (1960, p.&amp;nbsp;108) to denote "the structure and functioning of the corporate polity". The "corporate government" concept itself is older and was already used in finance textbooks at the beginning of the 20th century (Becht, Bolton, Röell 2004).

===Project governance===
{{main|Project governance}}
Project governance is the management framework within which project decisions are made.

===Environmental governance===
{{main|Environmental governance}}

===Land governance===
Land governance is concerned with issues of land ownership and tenure. It consists of the policies, processes and institutions by which decisions about the access to, use of and control over land are made, implemented and enforced; it is also about managing and reconciling competing claims on land. In developing countries, it is relevant as a tool to contribute to equitable and sustainable development, addressing the phenomenon that is known as ‘[[land grabbing]]’.&lt;ref&gt;Focus on Land in Africa (http://www.focusonland.com/property-rights-issues/land-governance-and-law-1/)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/335807-1194987153844/UNHABITATFricska.ppt Policy Paper: Good Land Governance]. Global Land Tool Network, no date.&lt;/ref&gt; The operational dimension of land governance is [[land administration]].

Security of land tenure is considered to contribute to poverty reduction and food security, since it can enable farmers to fully participate in the economy. Without recognized property rights, it is hard for small entrepreneurs, farmers included, to obtain credit or sell their business&lt;ref&gt;[[Hernando de Soto Polar|De Soto, Hernando]]. [http://www.basicbooks.com/full-details?isbn=9780465016150 The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else]. New York: Basic Books. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; - hence the relevance of comprehensive land governance.

There is constant feedback between land tenure problems and land governance.  For instance, it has been argued that what is frequently called '[[land grabbing]]', was partly made possible by the [[Washington Consensus]]-inspired liberalization of land markets in developing countries. Many land acquisition deals were perceived to have negative consequences, and this in turn led to initiatives to improve land governance in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Mayke Kaag and Annelies Zoomers: [https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/the-global-land-grab/ The global land grab: beyond the hype], Zed Books, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of land governance depends on its practical implementation, which is known as [[land administration]]: ‘the way in which rules of land tenure are made operational’. And another factor is accountability:  the degree to which citizens and stakeholder groups are consulted and can hold to account their authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Mayke Kaag and Annelies Zoomers, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main international policy initiative to improve land governance is known as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (VGGT),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/ VGGT]&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by the [[Committee on World Food Security]] (CFS).

===Internet governance===
{{main|Internet governance}}

===Information technology governance===
{{main|Information technology governance}}
IT governance primarily deals with connections between business focus and IT management. The goal of clear governance is to assure the investment in IT generate business value and mitigate the risks that are associated with IT projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Smallwood | first= Deb | work= Tech Decision CIO Insights | title = IT Governance: A Simple Model | date = March 2009 | url = http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/insurance/2009/02/it_governance_a_simple_model.php
| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory governance===
{{main|Regulatory governance}}
Regulatory governance reflects the emergence of decentered and mutually adaptive policy regimes which rests on regulation rather than service provision or taxing and spending.&lt;ref&gt;David Levi-Faur, "Regulation &amp; Regulatory Governance", in David Levi-Faur, Handbook on the Politics of Regulation, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2011, pp. 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The term captures the tendency of policy regimes to deal with complexity with delegated system of rules. It is likely to appear in arenas and nations which are more complex, more global, more contested and more liberally democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Braithwaite, John, Cary Coglianese, and David Levi‐Faur. "Can regulation and governance make a difference?." Regulation &amp; Governance 1.1 (2007): 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The term builds upon and extends the terms of the regulatory state on the one hand and governance on the other. While the term regulatory state marginalize non-state actors (NGOs and Business) in the domestic and global level, the term governance marginalizes regulation as a constitutive instrument of governance. The term regulatory governance therefore allows us to understand governance beyond the state and governance via regulation.

===Participatory governance===
Participatory governance focuses on deepening democratic engagement through the participation of citizens in the processes of governance with the state. The idea is that citizens should play a more direct roles in public decision-making or at least engage more deeply with political issues. Government officials should also be responsive to this kind of engagement. In practice, participatory governance can supplement the roles of citizens as voters or as watchdogs through more direct forms of involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/triumph-deficit-or-contestation-deepening-the-deepening-democracy-debate 'Triumph, Deficit or Contestation? Deepening the 'Deepening Democracy' Debate'] Institute of Development Studies (IDS) Working Paper 264 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contract governance===
(See also [[contract management]].) Emerging thinking about contract governance is focusing on creating a governance structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex contractual arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way.&lt;ref&gt;Unpacking Outsourcing Governance: How to Build a Sound Governance Structure to Drive Insight Versus Oversight|[http://www.vestedway.com/vested-library/]|2015|Vested Way|accessed 17 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson wrote that the governance structure for a contract is the “framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided.” Adding further that “because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction.”&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1979) "Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations," Journal of Law and Economics: Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multilevel governance===
{{main|Multilevel governance}}

===Metagovernance===
"Metagovernance" is the "governing of governing".&lt;ref&gt;Kooiman, J. ''Governing as Governance''. Sage publications 2003. p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the established ethical principles, or 'norms', that shape and steer the entire governing process. It is important to note that there are no clearly defined settings within which metagoverning takes place, or particular persons who are responsible for it. While some{{Who|date=January 2012}} believe metagoverning to be the role of the state which is assumed to want to steer actors in a particular direction, it can "potentially be exercised by any resourceful actor"&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, E. Metagovernance: The Changing Role of Politicians in Processes of Democratic Governance. ''American Review of Public Administration.'' Volume 36 2006, pp. 98–114 (p. 103).&lt;/ref&gt; who wishes to influence the governing process. Examples of this include the publishing of codes of conduct at the highest level of international government,&lt;ref&gt;Onyango, P &amp; Jentoft, S.

Routledge 2012. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; at the socio-cultural level. Despite their different sources, both seek to establish values in such a way that they become accepted 'norms'. The fact that 'norms' can be established at any level and can then be used to shape the governance process as whole, means metagovernance is part of both the input and the output of the governing system.&lt;ref&gt;Kooiman, J. ''Governing as Governance''. Sage publications 2003. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborative governance===
{{See also|Collaborative governance}}
A collaborative governance framework uses a relationship management structure, joint performance and transformation management processes and an exit management plan as controlling mechanisms to encourage the organizations to make ethical, proactive changes for the mutual benefit of all the parties.&lt;ref name="Vitasek"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitasek|first=Kate|display-authors=etal |title=The Vested Outsourcing Manual|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0230112684|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security sector governance ===
{{See also|Security sector governance}}Security sector governance (SSG) is a subpart concept or framework of security governance that focuses specifically on decisions about [[security]] and their implementation within the [[National security|security sector]] of a single state. SSG applies the principles of [[good governance]] to the security sector in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dcaf.ch|title=Security Sector Governance|last=|first=|publisher=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)|year=2015|isbn=|series=SSR Backgrounder Series|location=Geneva|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a normative concept==

===Fair governance===

When discussing governance in particular organizations, the quality of governance within the organization is often compared to a standard of [[good governance]]. In the case of a [[business]] or of a [[non-profit organization]], for example, good governance relates to consistent management, cohesive policies, guidance, processes and decision-rights for a given area of responsibility, and proper oversight and accountability. "Good governance" implies that mechanisms function in a way that allows the executives (the "agents") to respect the rights and interests of the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (the "principals"), in a spirit of [[democracy]].

===Good governance===
{{Main|Good governance}}
Good governance is an indeterminate term used in international development literature to describe various normative accounts of how public institutions ought to conduct public affairs and manage public resources. These normative accounts are often justified on the grounds that they are thought to be conducive to economic ends, such as the eradication of poverty and successful economic development. Unsurprisingly different organizations have defined governance and good governance differently to promote different normative ends.

The [[World Bank]] defines governance as:
{{quote|the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country's economic and social resources for development.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/03/07/000090341_20060307104630/Rendered/PDF/34899.pdf Managing Development – The Governance Dimension], 1991, Washington D.C., p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project of the World Bank defines governance as:
{{quote|the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/1740479-1150402582357/2661829-1158008871017/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This considers the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies and the respect of citizens and the state of the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them.

An alternate definition sees governance as:
{{quote|the use of institutions, structures of authority and even [[collaboration]] to allocate [[Resource (economics)|resources]] and coordinate or control activity in society or the economy''.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Stephen, 2002. Economic Governance and Institutional Dynamics, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s Regional Project on Local Governance for Latin America:

{{quote|Governance has been defined as the rules of the political system to solve conflicts between actors and adopt decision (legality). It has also been used to describe the "proper functioning of institutions and their acceptance by the public" (legitimacy). And it has been used to invoke the efficacy of government and the achievement of consensus by democratic means (participation).&lt;ref&gt;This is a very widely cited definition, as in [http://info.publicintelligence.net/ISAFgovernance.pdf Applebaugh, J. (rapporteur), "Governance Working Group", power-point presentation, National Defense University and ISAF, 2010, slide 22].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Measurement and assessment===

Since the early years of the 2000s (decade),{{When|date=January 2012}} efforts have been conducted in the research and international development community to assess and measure the quality of governance of countries all around the [[world]]. Measuring governance is inherently a controversial and somewhat political exercise. A distinction is therefore made between external assessments, peer assessments and self-assessments. Examples of external assessments are donor assessments or comparative indices produced by international non-governmental organizations. An example of a peer assessment is the [[African Peer Review Mechanism]]. Examples of self-assessments are [http://gaportal.org/country-initiatives country-led assessments] that can be led by government, civil society, researchers and/or other stakeholders at the national level.

One of these efforts to create an internationally comparable measure of governance and an example of an external assessment is the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project, developed by members of the World Bank and the [[World Bank Institute]]. The project reports aggregate and individual indicators for more than 200 countries for six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and lack of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, [[rule of law]], control of corruption. To complement the macro-level cross-country Worldwide Governance Indicators, the World Bank Institute developed the [[World Bank Governance Surveys]], which are country-level governance assessment tools that operate at the micro or sub-national level and use information gathered from a country’s own citizens, business people and public sector workers to diagnose governance vulnerabilities and suggest concrete approaches for fighting corruption.

A Worldwide Governance Index (WGI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article469 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144807/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article469 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 4 October 2011 | year =  | title = World Governance Index 2009 Report | publisher = World Governance | accessdate = 3 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed in 2009 and is open for improvement through public participation. The following domains, in the form of indicators and composite indexes, were selected to achieve the development of the WGI: Peace and Security, Rule of Law, Human Rights and Participation, Sustainable Development, and Human Development. Additionally, in 2009 the Bertelsmann Foundation published the [[Sustainable Governance Indicators]] (SGI), which systematically measure the need for reform and the capacity for reform within the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries. The project examines to what extent governments can identify, formulate and implement effective reforms that render a society well-equipped to meet future challenges, and ensure their future viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl = http://www.sgi-network.de/index.php?page=mission  | accessdate = | last = Empter  | first1 = Stefan  | first2 = Josef | last2 = Janning  | chapter=Sustainable Governance Indicators 2009 – An Introduction | editor-first  = Bertelsmann | editor-last = Stiftung | year = 2009| title = Policy Performance and Executive Capacity in the OECD | location = Gütersloh | publisher = Verlag Bertelsmann Stiftung}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20160413110418/http://xml.fido.gov/stratml/references/PL111-532StratML.htm#SEC10 Section 10] of the [[Government Performance and Results Act]] (GPRA) Modernization Act requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable format.

The International Budget Partnership (IBP) launched the [http://internationalbudget.org/what-we-do/major-ibp-initiatives/open-budget-initiative/ Open Budget Initiative] in 2006 with the release of the first [http://internationalbudget.org/what-we-do/open-budget-survey/ Open Budget Survey (OBS)]. The OBS is a comprehensive analysis and survey that evaluates whether central governments give the public access to budget documents and provide opportunities for public participation in the budget process. To measure the overall commitment to transparency, the IBP created [http://survey.internationalbudget.org/#rankings Open Budget Index] (OBI), which assigns a score to each country based on the results of the survey. While the OBS is released biannually, the IBP recently released a new [http://www.obstracker.org/ OBS Tracker], which serves as an online tool for civil society, the media, and other actors to monitor in real time whether governments are releasing eight key budget documents. The Open Budget Index data are used by the [[Open Government Partnership]], development aid agencies, and increasingly investors in the private sector as key indicators of governance, particularly fiscal transparency and management of public funds.&lt;ref&gt;Castro, Michael, 12 September 2013, [http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/michael-castro/2013/09/12/open-budgets-key-open-government-next-steps-ogp-countries#sthash.cFZvst8q.dpuf Open Budgets Key to Open Government: Next Steps for OGP Countries], retrieved 2 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of country-led assessments include the [http://www.gaportal.org/undp-supported/indonesia Indonesian Democracy Index], monitoring of the [http://www.gaportal.org/undp-supported/mongolia Millennium Development Goal 9 on Human Rights and Democratic Governance in Mongolia] and the [http://www.gaportal.org/undp-supported/bhutan Gross National Happiness Index in Bhutan].

Publishing performance reports openly on the Web in a standard, machine-readable format is good practice for all organizations whose plans and reports should be matters of public record.

The '''gray ceiling''' is a [[social phenomenon|business/societal phenomenon]] where the existing workforce of those born during the [[baby boom]] era prevents the slightly younger [[Generation X]]ers from advancing or being promoted at their jobs.

==General==
The gray ceiling phenomenon is most likely unintentional{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. Although it is true that baby boomers are staying on the job longer than previous generations, by sheer number they are also competing within their own generation and their children who are joining the workforce at the turn of the 21st century.

As the children of the baby boomers advance from below, the [[Generation X|Gen-Xers]], usually with middle management jobs, feel threatened and trapped in a job that is going nowhere and might be given away to the next younger candidate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

'''iPawn''' is a financial services company serving as an online lender and [[reseller]] for high end luxury goods. The company holds an online [[pawn shop]] license with headquarters in [[Tyler, Texas]]. iPawn raised over $4 million in investment&lt;ref name='money' /&gt; and has been cited as one of the leading companies in transitioning the pawn industry to the internet.&lt;ref name='time' /&gt;

== Services ==
iPawn provides two main services:
# Non-recourse loans, otherwise known as [[Secured loan|pawn loans]] or asset-based loans, against valuables.
# Buying and selling pre-owned valuables.

Both lending and retail services are rendered to consumers and small businesses.  iPawn provides its services against luxury items such as [[jewelry]], [[diamonds]], [[gemstones]], [[precious metals]] and high-end [[watches]].

== History ==
iPawn was established with the purpose of utilizing the latest technologies and internet for the veteran [[pawnbroking]] industry and to serve as a  high-end pawn broker,&lt;ref name="nypost"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2012/12/26/new-pawn-shops-court-high-end-borrowers/ |title=New pawn shops court high-end borrowers |author= Paul Tharp |date=26 December 2012 |work=nypost.com |publisher=New York Post |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; delivering a  simple, private way&lt;ref name='street'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/11794952/1/online-pawn-a-booming-business-luring-upscale-customers.html |title=Online Pawn: a Booming Business Luring Upscale Customers |author= Laurie Kulikowski |date=2012-12-18 |work=Thestreet.com |publisher=The Street |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to get loans or sell high end goods through the internet. The idea came after learning about the high interest rates charged by pawn shops. The company launched its services to the public in July 2012. In March 2013 iPawn closed $4 million in its second round of financing from a group of angel investors led by Dr. Rafi Gridron.&lt;ref name='money'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pehub.com/2013/03/ipawn-raises-4m/ |title=iPawn Raises $4M |author=Staff |date=March 14, 2013 |work=PE Hub |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 12, 2014 iPawn announced the launch of a new brand called [[Worthy.com|Worthy]] dealing only in after-market sales.

== Brick &amp; Mortar Pawn Shop Vs. Online Pawn Shop ==
While services provided by a brick and mortar pawn shop are similar to those provided by the online ones, there are few main differences: most notably, the means by which services are rendered. In a brick and mortar pawn shop, the process of receiving a loan or selling a valuable is done in person&lt;ref name='mainstream'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nz.finance.yahoo.com/news/pawn-shops-mainstream-141414562.html |title=Pawn Shops Go Mainstream |author=Geoff Williams |date=14 March 2013 |work=U.S.News &amp; World Report |publisher=U.S. News |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in an online pawn shop the process is conducted through the internet&lt;ref name='street' /&gt; and a courier of choice. The low inventory overhead results in the ability to provide higher value and lower interest rates. Another notable difference is the appraisal process of the submitted valuables: in a brick and mortar pawn shop, the appraisal is done in the local shop itself while in an online pawn shop, all items are shipped to a central facility where the appraisal is made.

== Licenses and Accreditation ==
iPawn is a licensed pawn shop certified by the Texas Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://occc04.occc.state.tx.us/detail.asp?License_Number=62737 |title=OCCC License |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (OCCC). Additionally, iPawn holds a precious dealer certificate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/PreciousMetals/Reports/ActiveDealers.aspx |title=Active Precious Metal Dealers |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; also granted by the Texas OCCC. iPawn is accredited by the [[Better Business Bureau]].

== Partnerships ==
iPawn has partnered in 2012 with [[FedEx]] and ParcelPro to provide insured shipping services. iPawn also partnered with [[Delta Lloyd]] in the same year to provide insurance to its facilities.

== In the Media ==
In August 2013, [[MSN]] Money Watch discussed how iPawn caters to affluent individuals and families that don't need money immediately but want a more sizable  loan to help their cash flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.msn.com/personal-finance/pawn-shops-go-mainstream |title=Pawn shops go mainstream |author= Geoff Williams |date=14 March 2013 |work=U.S.News &amp; World Report |publisher=U.S. News |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In an article published in July 2013, Reuters discusses the benefits of the purely online transactions carried out by iPawn, focusing on the desired discretion amidst the negative stigma of pawn shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/02/us-financing-pawnbrokers-idUSBRE9610QX20130702 |title=High-end pawn shops solve small business cash crunch |author=DEBORAH L. COHEN |date=2 July 2013 |work=Reuters.com |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013,[[LearnVest]] brought into focus the story of a dentist who chose to use iPawn to sell family jewelry instead of a traditional bank loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnvest.com/2013/05/pawn-shops-go-upscale-is-this-a-good-way-to-score-extra-cash/ |title=Pawn Shops Go Upscale: Is This a Good Way to Score Extra Cash? |author=Stephanie Taylor Christensen |date=May 21, 2013 |work=Learnvest.com |publisher=Learnvest |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yahoo]] New Zealand published an article in March 2013 shedding light on the new world of online pawn shops and what to expect when utilizing their services.&lt;ref name='mainstream' /&gt;

[[South Coast Today]] Describes in an article published January 2013 how small business are turning to pawn shops for short-term loans, a better suited alternative to traditional bank loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130118/SCBULLETIN/301280337 |title=Online pawn shops offer financing option for small business |author=Jennifer Lade |date=January 18, 2013 |work=Southcoast Business Bulletin |publisher=southcoasttoday.com |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 2013, [[TIME]] Business and Finance discussed the reinvention of the pawn industry and its transition to the internet.&lt;ref name='time'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.time.com/2013/01/17/reinventing-the-pawn-shop/ |title=Reinventing the Pawn Shop |author=Sarah Max |date=Jan 17, 2013 |work=Time Business and Money |publisher=Time |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KETK [[NBC]] Sits down with iPawn COO in December 2012 to talk about bringing the pawn shop online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ketknbc.com/east-texas-live/etl-the-revolution-of-online-loans |title=ETL: The revolution of online loans |author=Angela Berry |date=December 13, 2012 |work=kektnbc.com |publisher=NBC |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, NuWire Investor provided a detailed layout of the upscale online pawn industry and its move away from the originally bad stigma attached to pawn shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuwireinvestor.com/articles/online-pawning-goes-uptown-60268.aspx |title=Online Pawning Goes Uptown |author=Laurie Kulikowski |date=December 21, 2012 |work=Nuwireinvestor.com |publisher=NuWire |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in December 2012, The [[New York Post]] wrote about the appeal of high-end online pawn shops from small business owners to wealthy celebrities.

In [[mathematics]], the '''inverse trigonometric functions''' (occasionally also called '''arcus functions''',&lt;ref name="Taczanowski_1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazewinkel_1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebner_2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mejlbro_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duran_2012"/&gt; '''antitrigonometric functions'''&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt; or '''cyclometric functions'''&lt;ref name="Klein_1924"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dörrie_1965"/&gt;) are the [[inverse function]]s of the [[trigonometric functions]] (with suitably restricted [[Domain of a function|domain]]s). Specifically, they are the inverses of the [[sine]], [[cosine]], [[tangent (trigonometry)|tangent]], [[cotangent]], [[secant (trigonometry)|secant]], and [[cosecant]] functions, and are used to obtain an angle from any of the angle's trigonometric ratios. Inverse trigonometric functions are widely used in [[engineering]], [[navigation]], [[physics]], and [[geometry]].

==Notation==
There are several notations used for the inverse trigonometric functions.

The most common convention is to name inverse trigonometric functions using an arc- prefix, e.g., {{math|arcsin(''x'')}}, {{math|arccos(''x'')}}, {{math|arctan(''x'')}}, etc.&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt; This convention is used throughout the article.
When measuring in radians, an angle of θ radians will correspond to an arc whose length is rθ, where r is the radius of the circle. Thus, in the [[unit circle]], "the arc whose cosine is x" is the same as "the angle whose cosine is x", because the length of the arc of the circle in radii is the same as the measurement of the angle in radians.&lt;ref name="Americana_1912"/&gt; Similarly, in computer programming languages the inverse trigonometric functions are usually called asin, acos, atan.

The notations {{math|sin&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|cos&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|tan&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, etc., as introduced by [[John Herschel]] in 1813,&lt;ref name="Cajori"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herschel_1813"/&gt; are often used as well in British&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt; sources, and this convention complies with the notation of an [[inverse function]]. This might appear to conflict logically with the common semantics for expressions like {{math|sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, which refer to numeric power rather than function composition, and therefore may result in confusion between [[multiplicative inverse]] and [[Inverse function|compositional inverse]]. The confusion is somewhat ameliorated by the fact that each of the reciprocal trigonometric functions has its own name—for example, {{math|(cos(''x''))&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} = {{math|sec(''x'')}}. Nevertheless, certain authors advise against using it for its ambiguity.&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korn_2000"/&gt; Another convention used by a few authors&lt;ref name="Bhatti_1999"/&gt; is to use a [[majuscule]] (capital/upper-case) first letter along with a &amp;minus;1 superscript, e.g., {{math|Sin&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|Cos&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|Tan&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, etc., which avoids confusing them with the multiplicative inverse, which should be represented by {{math|sin&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|cos&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, etc. Since 2009, the [[ISO_80000-2#Function_symbols_and_definitions|ISO 80000-2]] standard has removed the ambiguity by specifying solely the "arc" prefix for the inverse functions.

==Basic properties==

===Principal values===
Since none of the six trigonometric functions are [[One-to-one function|one-to-one]], they are restricted in order to have inverse functions. Therefore the [[Range (mathematics)|range]]s of the inverse functions are proper [[subset]]s of the domains of the original functions.

For example, using ''function'' in the sense of [[multivalued function]]s, just as the [[square root]] function {{math|''y'' {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''}}}} could be defined from {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''x''}}, the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} arcsin(''x'')}} is defined so that sin(''y'') = ''x''. For a given real number ''x'', with −1 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1, there are multiple (in fact, countably infinitely many) numbers ''y'' such that {{math|sin(''y'') {{=}} ''x''}}; for example, {{math|sin(0) {{=}} 0}}, but also {{math|sin(&amp;pi;) {{=}} 0}}, {{math|sin(2&amp;pi;) {{=}} 0}}, etc. When only one value is desired, the function may be restricted to its [[principal branch]]. With this restriction, for each ''x'' in the domain the expression {{math|arcsin(''x'')}} will evaluate only to a single value, called its [[principal value]]. These properties apply to all the inverse trigonometric functions.

The principal inverses are listed in the following table.

(Note: Some authors define the range of arcsecant to be ( 0 ≤ ''y'' &lt; {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or {{pi}} ≤ ''y'' &lt; {{sfrac|3{{pi}}|2}} ), because the tangent function is nonnegative on this domain. This makes some computations more consistent. For example using this range, {{math|tan(arcsec(''x'')) {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}}}, whereas with the range ( 0 ≤ ''y'' &lt; {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} &lt; ''y'' ≤ {{pi}} ), we would have to write {{math|tan(arcsec(''x'')) {{=}} ±{{sqrt|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}}}, since tangent is nonnegative on 0 ≤ ''y'' &lt; {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} but nonpositive on {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} &lt; ''y'' ≤ {{pi}}. For a similar reason, the same authors define the range of arccosecant to be −{{pi}} &lt; ''y'' ≤ −{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or 0 &lt; ''y'' ≤ {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}.)

If ''x'' is allowed to be a [[complex number]], then the range of ''y'' applies only to its real part.

===Relationships between trigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric functions===

Trigonometric functions of inverse trigonometric functions are tabulated below. A quick way to derive them is by considering the geometry of a right-angled triangle, with one side of length 1, and another side of length ''x'' (any real number between 0 and 1), then applying the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and definitions of the trigonometric ratios. Purely algebraic derivations are longer.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

\arccsc\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) &amp;= \arcsin(x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If you only have a fragment of a sine table:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\arccos(x) &amp;= \arcsin\left(\sqrt{1 - x^2}\right) \, , \text{ if } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
\arccos(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\arccos\left(2x^2-1\right) \, , \text{ if } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
\arcsin(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\arccos\left(1-2x^2\right) \, , \text{ if } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
\arcsin(x) &amp;= \arctan\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\right) \\
\arctan(x) &amp;= \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Whenever the square root of a complex number is used here, we choose the root with the positive real part (or positive imaginary part if the square was negative real).

From the [[tangent half-angle formula|half-angle formula]], &lt;math&gt;\tan\left(\tfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \tfrac{\sin(\theta)}{1 + \cos(\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;, we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\arcsin(x) &amp;= 2 \arctan\left(\frac{x}{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}\right) \\[0.5em]
\arccos(x) &amp;= 2 \arctan\left(\frac{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{1 + x}\right) \, , \text{ if } -1 &lt; x \leq + 1 \\[0.5em]
\arctan(x) &amp;= 2 \arctan\left(\frac{x}{1 + \sqrt{1 + x^2}}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Arctangent addition formula===
:&lt;math&gt;\arctan(u) \pm \arctan(v) = \arctan\left(\frac{u \pm v}{1 \mp uv}\right) \pmod \pi \, , \quad u v \ne 1 \, .&lt;/math&gt;
This is derived from the tangent [[Angle sum and difference identities|addition formula]]
:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\alpha \pm \beta) = \frac{\tan(\alpha) \pm \tan(\beta)}{1 \mp \tan(\alpha)\tan(\beta)} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
by letting
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \arctan(u) \, , \quad \beta = \arctan(v) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

==In calculus==

==={{anchor|Derivatives}}Derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions===
:{{Main|Differentiation of trigonometric functions}}

The [[derivative]]s for complex values of ''z'' are as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dz} \arcsin(z) &amp;{} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z^2}} \; ;   &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -1, +1 \\
\frac{d}{dz} \arccos(z) &amp;{} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z^2}} \; ;  &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -1, +1 \\
\frac{d}{dz} \arctan(z) &amp;{} = \frac{1}{1+z^2} \; ;          &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -i, +i\\
\frac{d}{dz} \arccot(z) &amp;{} = -\frac{1}{1+z^2} \; ;         &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -i, +i \\
\frac{d}{dz} \arcsec(z) &amp;{} = \frac{1}{z^2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{z^{2}}}} \; ;   &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -1, 0, +1 \\
\frac{d}{dz} \arccsc(z) &amp;{} = -\frac{1}{z^2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{z^{2}}}} \; ;  &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -1, 0, +1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Only for real values of ''x'':
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dx} \arcsec(x) &amp;{} = \frac{1}{|x| \sqrt{x^2-1}} \; ;  &amp; |x| &gt; 1\\
\frac{d}{dx} \arccsc(x) &amp;{} = -\frac{1}{|x| \sqrt{x^2-1}} \; ; &amp; |x| &gt; 1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For a sample derivation: if &lt;math&gt;\theta = \arcsin(x)&lt;/math&gt;, we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \arcsin(x)}{dx} = \frac{d \theta}{d \sin(\theta)} = \frac{d \theta}{\cos(\theta)d \theta} = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2(\theta)}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Expression as definite integrals===
Integrating the derivative and fixing the value at one point gives an expression for the inverse trigonometric function as a definite integral:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\arcsin(x) &amp;{}= \int_0^x \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - z^2}} \, dz \; , &amp; |x| &amp;{} \leq 1\\
\arccos(x) &amp;{}= \int_x^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - z^2}} \, dz \; , &amp; |x| &amp;{} \leq 1\\
\arctan(x) &amp;{}= \int_0^x \frac{1}{z^2 + 1} \, dz \; ,\\
\arccot(x) &amp;{}= \int_x^\infty \frac{1}{z^2 + 1} \, dz \; ,\\
\arcsec(x) &amp;{}= \int_1^x \frac{1}{z \sqrt{z^2 - 1}} \, dz = \pi + \int_x^{-1} \frac{1}{z \sqrt{z^2 - 1}} \, dz\; , &amp; x &amp;{} \geq 1\\
\arccsc(x) &amp;{}= \int_x^\infty \frac{1}{z \sqrt{z^2 - 1}} \, dz = \int_{-\infty}^x \frac{1}{z \sqrt{z^2 - 1}} \, dz \; , &amp; x &amp;{} \geq 1\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
When ''x'' equals 1, the integrals with limited domains are [[improper integral]]s, but still well-defined.

===Infinite series===
Like the sine and cosine functions, the inverse trigonometric functions can be calculated using [[power series]], as follows. For arcsine, the series can be derived by expanding its derivative, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, as a [[binomial series]], and integrating term by term (using the integral definition as above). The series for arctangent can similarly be derived by expanding its derivative &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+z^2}&lt;/math&gt; in a [[geometric series]] and applying the integral definition above (see [[Leibniz series]]).

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\arcsin(z) &amp; = z + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \frac{z^3}{3} + \left( \frac{1 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 4} \right) \frac{z^5}{5} + \left( \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6} \right) \frac{z^7}{7} + \cdots \\[5pt]
&amp; = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(2n-1)!!}{(2n)!!} \cdot \frac{z^{2n+1}}{2n+1} \\[5pt]
&amp; = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\binom{2n} n z^{2n+1}}{4^n (2n+1)} \, ; \qquad |z| \le 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\arctan(z)
= z - \frac{z^3}{3} +\frac{z^5}{5} - \frac{z^7}{7} + \cdots
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n z^{2n+1}}{2n+1} \, ; \qquad |z| \le 1 \qquad z \neq i,-i&lt;/math&gt;

Series for the other inverse trigonometric functions can be given in terms of these according to the relationships given above.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\arccos(x) = \pi/2 - \arcsin(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\arccsc(x) = \arcsin(1/x)&lt;/math&gt;, and so on.  Another series is given by:&lt;ref name="Borwein_2004"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2\left(\arcsin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \right)^2 = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^{2n}}{n^2\binom {2n} n}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Leonhard Euler]] found a series for the arctangent that converges more quickly than its [[Taylor series]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\arctan(z) = \frac z {1 + z^2} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \prod_{k=1}^n \frac{2k z^2}{(2k + 1)(1 + z^2)}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= An elementary derivation of Euler’s series for the arctangent function|journal = The Mathematical Gazette | author = Hwang Chien-Lih | doi = 10.1017/S0025557200178404 | year = 2005 | volume = 89 | issue = 516}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(The term in the sum for ''n'' = 0 is the [[empty product]], so is 1.)

Alternatively, this can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\arctan(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2^{2n} (n!)^2}{(2n + 1)!} \; \frac{z^{2n + 1}}{(1 + z^2)^{n + 1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Continued fractions for arctangent====
Two alternatives to the power series for arctangent are these [[generalized continued fraction]]s:

: &lt;math&gt;\arctan(z) =
\frac z {1 + \cfrac{(1z)^2}{3 - 1z^2 + \cfrac{(3z)^2}{5 - 3z^2 + \cfrac{(5z)^2}{7 - 5z^2 + \cfrac{(7z)^2}{9-7z^2 + \ddots}}}}} =
\frac{z}{1 + \cfrac{(1z)^2}{3 + \cfrac{(2z)^2}{5 + \cfrac{(3z)^2}{7 + \cfrac{(4z)^2}{9 + \ddots}}}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The second of these is valid in the cut complex plane. There are two cuts, from &amp;minus;'''i''' to the point at infinity, going down the imaginary axis, and from '''i''' to the point at infinity, going up the same axis. It works best for real numbers running from −1 to 1. The partial denominators are the odd natural numbers, and the partial numerators (after the first) are just (''nz'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with each perfect square appearing once. The first was developed by [[Leonhard Euler]]; the second by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] utilizing the [[Gaussian hypergeometric series]].

===Indefinite integrals of inverse trigonometric functions===

For real and complex values of ''z'':
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \arcsin(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arcsin(z) + \sqrt{1 - z^2} + C\\
\int \arccos(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arccos(z) - \sqrt{1 - z^2} + C\\
\int \arctan(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arctan(z) - \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( 1 + z^2 \right) + C\\
\int \arccot(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arccot(z) + \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( 1 + z^2 \right) + C\\
\int \arcsec(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arcsec(z) - \ln \left[ z \left( 1 + \sqrt{ \frac{z^2-1}{z^2} } \right) \right] + C\\
\int \arccsc(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arccsc(z) + \ln \left[ z \left( 1 + \sqrt{ \frac{z^2-1}{z^2} } \right) \right] + C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For real ''x'' ≥ 1:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \arcsec(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arcsec(x) - \ln \left( x + \sqrt{x^2-1} \right) + C\\
\int \arccsc(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arccsc(x) + \ln \left( x + \sqrt{x^2-1} \right) + C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For all real ''x'' not between -1 and 1:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \arcsec(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arcsec(x) - \sgn(x) \ln\left(\left| x + \sqrt{x^2-1}\right|\right) + C\\
\int \arccsc(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arccsc(x) + \sgn(x) \ln\left(\left| x + \sqrt{x^2-1}\right|\right) + C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value is necessary to compensate for both negative and positive values of the arcsecant and arccosecant functions. The signum function is also necessary due to the absolute values in the [[#Derivatives|derivative]]s of the two functions, which create two different solutions for positive and negative values of x. These can be further simplified using the logarithmic definitions of the [[Inverse hyperbolic functions#Logarithmic representation|inverse hyperbolic function]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \arcsec(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arcsec(x) - \operatorname{arcosh}(|x|) + C\\
\int \arccsc(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arccsc(x) + \operatorname{arcosh}(|x|) + C\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value in the argument of the arcosh function creates a negative half of its graph, making it identical to the signum logarithmic function shown above.

All of these antiderivatives can be derived using [[integration by parts]] and the simple derivative forms shown above.

====Example====
Using &lt;math&gt;\int u \, dv = u v - \int v \, du&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. [[integration by parts]]), set

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
u &amp;= \arcsin(x) &amp; dv &amp;= dx \\
du &amp;= \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} &amp; v &amp;= x
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;\int \arcsin(x) \, dx = x \arcsin(x) - \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

which by a simple [[Integration by substitution|substitution]] yields the final result:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \arcsin(x) \, dx = x \arcsin(x) + \sqrt{1-x^2} + C &lt;/math&gt;

== Extension to complex plane ==

[[File:Riemann surface for Arg of ArcTan of x.svg|thumb|A [[Riemann surface]] for the argument of the Tan[z]=x function in the complex plane of x. The orange sheet in the middle is the principal sheet representing ArcTan(x). The blue sheet above and green sheet below are displaced by 2 &amp;pi; and -2 &amp;pi; respectively.]]

Since the inverse trigonometric functions are [[analytic function]]s, they can be extended from the real line to the complex plane. This results in functions with multiple sheets and [[branch point]]s. One possible way of defining the extension is:
:&lt;math&gt;\arctan(z) = \int_0^z \frac{dx}{1 + x^2} \quad z \neq -i, +i &lt;/math&gt;
where the part of the imaginary axis which does not lie strictly between the branch points (&amp;minus;i and +i) is the [[branch cut]] between the principal sheet and other sheets. The path of the integral must not cross a branch cut. For ''z'' not on a branch cut, a straight line path from 0 to ''z'' is such a path. For ''z'' on a branch cut, the path must approach from Re[x]&gt;0 for the upper branch cut and from Re[x]&lt;0 for the lower branch cut.

The arcsine function may then be defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\arcsin(z) = \arctan\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{1 - z^2}}\right) \quad z \neq -1, +1 &lt;/math&gt;
where (the square-root function has its cut along the negative real axis and) the part of the real axis which does not lie strictly between &amp;minus;1 and +1 is the branch cut between the principal sheet of arcsin and other sheets;
:&lt;math&gt;\arccos(z) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin(z) \quad z \neq -1, +1 &lt;/math&gt;
which has the same cut as arcsin;
:&lt;math&gt;\arccot(z) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arctan(z) \quad z \neq -i, i &lt;/math&gt;
which has the same cut as arctan;
:&lt;math&gt;\arcsec(z) = \arccos\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \quad z \neq -1, 0, +1 &lt;/math&gt;
where the part of the real axis between &amp;minus;1 and +1 inclusive is the cut between the principal sheet of arcsec and other sheets;
:&lt;math&gt;\arccsc(z) = \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \quad z \neq -1, 0, +1 &lt;/math&gt;
which has the same cut as '''arcsec'''.

===Logarithmic forms===
These functions may also be expressed using [[complex logarithm]]s. This extends in a natural fashion their [[domain of a function|domain]] to the [[complex plane]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\arcsin(z) &amp;{}= -i \ln \left( iz + \sqrt{1-z^2} \right) &amp;{}= \arccsc\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arccos(z) &amp;{}= -i \ln \left( z + \sqrt{z^2-1} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} \, + i \ln \left( iz + \sqrt{1-z^2} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin(z) &amp;{}= \arcsec\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arctan(z) &amp;{}= \tfrac{1}{2} i \left[ \ln \left(1 - iz \right) - \ln \left( 1 + iz \right) \right] &amp;{}= \arccot\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arccot(z) &amp;{}= \tfrac{1}{2} i \left[ \ln \left(1 - \frac{i}{z} \right) - \ln \left( 1 + \frac{i}{z} \right) \right] &amp;{}= \arctan\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arcsec(z) &amp;{}= -i \ln \left( \sqrt{\frac{1}{z^2} - 1} + \frac{1}{z} \right) = i \, \ln \left( \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{z^2}} + \frac{i}{z} \right) + \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arccsc(z) &amp;{}= \arccos\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arccsc(z) &amp;{}= -i \ln \left( \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{z^2}} + \frac{i}{z}\right) &amp;{}= \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Elementary proofs of these relations proceed via expansion to exponential forms of the trigonometric functions.

====Example proof====

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(\phi) = z &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \arcsin(z)&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[Trigonometric functions#Relationship to exponential function and complex numbers|exponential definition of sine]], one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;z = \frac{e^{\phi i} - e^{-\phi i}}{2i}&lt;/math&gt;

Let

:&lt;math&gt;\xi = e^{\phi i} &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z = \frac{\xi - \frac{1}{\xi}}{2i}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2iz = {\xi - \frac{1}{\xi}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\xi - 2iz - \frac{1}{\xi}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\xi^2 - 2i \xi z - 1 \, = \, 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\xi = iz \pm \sqrt{1-z^2} = e^{\phi i}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi i = \ln \left( iz \pm \sqrt{1-z^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi= -i \ln \left( iz \pm \sqrt{1-z^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

(the positive branch is chosen)

:&lt;math&gt;\phi= \arcsin(z) = -i \ln \left(iz + \sqrt{1-z^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

===General solutions===
Each of the trigonometric functions is periodic in the real part of its argument, running through all its values twice in each interval of 2{{pi}}. Sine and cosecant begin their period at 2{{pi}}''k'' − {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} (where ''k'' is an integer), finish it at 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, and then reverse themselves over 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} to 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|3{{pi}}|2}}. Cosine and secant begin their period at 2{{pi}}''k'', finish it at 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{pi}}, and then reverse themselves over 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{pi}} to 2{{pi}}''k'' + 2{{pi}}. Tangent begins its period at 2{{pi}}''k'' − {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, finishes it at 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, and then repeats it (forward) over 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} to 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|3{{pi}}|2}}. Cotangent begins its period at 2{{pi}}''k'', finishes it at 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{pi}}, and then repeats it (forward) over 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{pi}} to 2{{pi}}''k'' + 2{{pi}}.

This periodicity is reflected in the general inverses where ''k'' is some integer:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arcsin(x) + 2\pi k \; \text{ or } \; y = \pi - \arcsin(x) + 2\pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:which, written in one equation, is: &lt;math&gt;\sin(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = (-1)^k\arcsin(x) + \pi k.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arccos(x) + 2\pi k \; \text{ or } \; y = 2\pi - \arccos(x) + 2\pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:which, written in one equation, is: &lt;math&gt;\cos(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \pm \arccos(x) + 2\pi k.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tan(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arctan(x) + \pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cot(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arccot(x) + \pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sec(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arcsec(x) + 2\pi k \text{ or } y = 2\pi - \arcsec (x) + 2\pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\csc(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arccsc(x) + 2\pi k \text{ or } y = \pi - \arccsc(x) + 2\pi k&lt;/math&gt;

====Application: finding the angle of a right triangle====
[[Image:Trigonometry triangle.svg|right|thumb|A right triangle.]]
Inverse trigonometric functions are useful when trying to determine the remaining two angles of a [[right triangle]] when the lengths of the sides of the triangle are known. Recalling the right-triangle definitions of sine and cosine, it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arcsin \left( \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \right) = \arccos \left( \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \right) .&lt;/math&gt;

Often, the hypotenuse is unknown and would need to be calculated before using arcsine or arccosine using the [[Pythagorean Theorem]]: &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=h^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the hypotenuse. Arctangent comes in handy in this situation, as the length of the hypotenuse is not needed.

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan \left( \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \right) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

For example, suppose a roof drops 8 feet as it runs out 20 feet. The roof makes an angle ''θ'' with the horizontal, where ''θ'' may be computed as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta
= \arctan \left( \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \right)
= \arctan \left( \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} \right)
= \arctan \left( \frac{8}{20} \right) \approx 21.8^{\circ} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

===In computer science and engineering===

====Two-argument variant of arctangent====
{{anchor|Two-argument variant of arctangent}}
{{main|atan2}}
The two-argument [[atan2]] function computes the arctangent of ''y'' / ''x'' given ''y'' and ''x'', but with a range of (−{{pi}},&amp;nbsp;{{pi}}]. In other words, atan2(''y'',&amp;nbsp;''x'') is the angle between the positive ''x''-axis of a plane and  the point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') on it, with positive sign for counter-clockwise angles (upper half-plane, ''y''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0), and negative sign for clockwise angles (lower half-plane, ''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0). It was first introduced in many computer programming languages, but it is now also common in other fields of science and engineering.
 
In terms of the standard '''arctan''' function, that is with range of (−{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}), it can be expressed as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(y, x) = \begin{cases}
  \arctan(\frac y x) &amp; \quad x &gt; 0 \\
  \arctan(\frac y x) + \pi &amp; \quad y \ge 0 \; , \; x &lt; 0 \\
  \arctan(\frac y x) - \pi &amp; \quad y &lt; 0 \; , \; x &lt; 0 \\
  \frac{\pi}{2} &amp; \quad y &gt; 0 \; , \; x = 0 \\
  -\frac{\pi}{2} &amp; \quad y &lt; 0 \; , \; x = 0 \\
  \text{undefined} &amp; \quad y = 0 \; , \; x = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

It also equals the [[principal value]] of the [[arg (mathematics)|arg]]ument of the [[complex number]] ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''i'''''y''.

This function may also be defined using the [[tangent half-angle formula]]e as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(y, x) = 2\arctan\left(\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + x}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
provided that either ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 or ''y''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0. However this fails if given x&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;0 and y&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 so the expression is unsuitable for computational use.

The above argument order (''y'', ''x'') seems to be the most common, and in particular is used in [[ISO standard]]s such as the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], but a few authors may use the opposite convention (''x'', ''y'') so some caution is warranted.  These variations are detailed at [[atan2#Realizations of the function in common programming languages|atan2]].

====Arctangent function with location parameter====
In many applications{{which|date=March 2014}} the solution &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of the equation &lt;math&gt;x=\tan(y)&lt;/math&gt; is to come as close as possible to a given value &lt;math&gt;-\infty &lt; \eta &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;. The adequate solution is produced by the parameter modified arctangent function 
:&lt;math&gt;
y = \arctan_\eta(x) := \arctan(x) + \pi \cdot \operatorname{rni}\left(\frac{\eta - \arctan(x)}{\pi} \right)\, .
&lt;/math&gt;
The function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rni}&lt;/math&gt; rounds to the nearest integer.

====Numerical accuracy====

For angles near 0 and {{pi}}, arccosine is [[ill-conditioned]] and will thus calculate the angle with reduced accuracy in a computer implementation (due to the limited number of digits).&lt;ref name="Gade_2010"/&gt; Similarly, arcsine is inaccurate for angles near &amp;minus;{{pi}}/2 and {{pi}}/2.

[[File:Cicero.PNG|thumb|upright|The Roman politician [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] coined the phrase ''ipse dixit'', which translates from the Latin as, "he said it himself"]]

'''''Ipse dixit''''' ([[Latin]] for "he said it himself") is an assertion without proof; or a [[dogma]]tic expression of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, William Dwight. (1906). [https://books.google.com/books?id=73tEAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3179&amp;dq= "''Ipse dixit''"], ''The Century dictionary and cyclopedia,'' pp. 379–380; Westbrook, Robert B. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0I-9gJN9rbwC&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq= "John Dewey and American Democracy", p. 359].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[fallacy]] of defending a proposition by baldly asserting that it is "just how it is" distorts the argument by opting out of it entirely: the claimant declares an issue to be intrinsic, and not changeable.&lt;ref name="comp"&gt;VanderMey, Randall ''et al.'' (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=l7I-ykFAC3cC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=bare+assertion+fallacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mHHGULnmLIS60AHGuICACA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=bare%20assertion%20fallacy&amp;f=false ''Comp'', p. 183]; excerpt: "Bare assertion. The most basic way to distort an issue is to deny that it exists. This fallacy claims, 'That's just how it is.' "&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Latin form of the expression comes from the Roman orator and philosopher [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] (106–43 BC) in his theological studies ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' (''On the Nature of the Gods'') and is his translation of the Greek expression (with the identical meaning) αὐτὸς ἔφα (''autòs épha''), an [[argument from authority]] made by the [[Pythagoreans|disciples of Pythagoras]] when appealing to the pronouncements of the master rather than to reason or evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Poliziano, Angelo. (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=AAR2oNDiQkwC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=De+Natura+Deorum+ipse+dixit&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9DPHUKC_KbK30gGvyIDoDw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=De%20Natura%20Deorum%20ipse%20dixit&amp;f=false  ''Angelo Poliziano's Lamia: Text, Translation, and Introductory Studies,'' p. 26]; excerpt, "In Cicero's ''De natura deorum,'' as well as in other sources, the phrase “Ipse dixit” pointed to the notion that Pythagoras's disciples would use that short phrase as justification for adopting a position: if the master had said it, it was enough for them and there was no need to argue further."&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the early 17th century, [[Scholasticism|scholars]] applied the ''ipse dixit'' term to justify their subject-matter arguments if the arguments previously had been used by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Burton, George Ward. (1909). [https://books.google.com/books?id=pA8wAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA27&amp;dq= ''Burton's book on California and its sunlit skies of glory,'' p. 27]; excerpt, "But by the time of [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], students had fallen into the habit of accepting Aristotle as an infallible guide, and when a dispute arose the appeal was not to fact, but to Aristotle's theory, and the phrase, ''Ipse dixit,'' ended all dispute."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ipse-dixitism ===
In the late 18th century, [[Jeremy Bentham]] adapted the term ''ipse dixit'' into the word ''ipse-dixitism.''&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, Jeremy. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=uPLufahzlaUC&amp;pg=PA323&amp;lpg=PA323&amp;dq= ''Deontology; or, The science of morality,'' Vol. 1, p. 323]; excerpt, "ipsedixitism ... comes down to us from an antique and high authority, —-it is the principle recognised (so Cicero informs us) by the disciples of Pythagoras. ''Ipse'' {he, the master, Pythagoras), ''ipse dixit'', — he has said it; the master has said that it is so; therefore, say the disciples of the illustrious sage, therefore so it is."&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham coined the term to apply to all non-[[utilitarian]] political arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, Jeremy. (1838). [https://books.google.com/books?id=DHhYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq= ''Works of Jeremy Bentham,'' p. 192]; excerpt, "...&amp;nbsp;it is not a mere ''ipse dixit'' that will warrant us to give credit for utility to institutions, in which not the least trace of utility is discernible."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal usage===
In modern legal and administrative decisions, the term ''ipse dixit'' has generally been used as a criticism of arguments based solely upon the authority of an individual or organization.  For example, in ''National Tire Dealers &amp; Retreaders Association, Inc. v. Brinegar,'' 491 F.2d 31, 40 (D.C. Cir. 1974), Circuit Judge [[Malcolm Richard Wilkey|Wilkey]] considered that the Secretary of Transportation's "statement of the reasons for his conclusion that the requirements are practicable is not so inherently plausible that the court can accept it on the agency's mere ''ipse dixit''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/1974522491F2d31_1516.xml/NATIONAL%20TIRE%20DEALERS%20&amp;%20RETREAD.%20ASS'N,%20INC.%20v.%20BRINEGAR|title=National Tire Dealers &amp; Retread. Ass'n Inc. vs. Brinegar|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized the problem of "opinion evidence which is connected to existing data only by the ''ipse dixit'' of an expert".&lt;ref&gt;Filan, citing [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-188.ZS.html  ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner,''] 522 U.S. 136, 137; 118 S.Ct. 512; 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Texas Supreme Court has held "a claim will not stand or fall on the mere ''ipse dixit'' of a credentialed witness".&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2125793418825711243&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr "Burrow v. Arce,"] 997 S.W.2d 229, 235 (Tex. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1858, Abraham Lincoln said in his speech at Freeport, Illinois, at the second joint debate with Douglas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I pass one or two points I have because my time will very soon expire, but I must be allowed to say that Judge Douglas recurs again, as he did upon one or two other occasions, to the enormity of Lincoln,—an insignificant individual like Lincoln,— upon his ''ipse dixit'' charging a conspiracy upon a large number of members of Congress, the Supreme Court, and two Presidents, to nationalize slavery. I want to say that, in the first place, I have made no charge of any sort upon my ''ipse dixit''. I have only arrayed the evidence tending to prove it, and presented it to the understanding of others, saying what I think it proves,  but giving you the means of judging whether it proves it or not. This is precisely what I have done. I have not placed it upon my ''ipse dixit'' at all.&lt;ref&gt;From [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln3?view=toc ''The complete works of Abraham Lincoln'', Vol. III], pp. 290-291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the theory of many-particle systems, '''Jacobi coordinates''' often are used to simplify the mathematical formulation.  These coordinates are particularly common in treating polyatomic [[molecule]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s,&lt;ref name= Zhang&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In words, the algorithm is described as follows:&lt;ref name=Cabral/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; be the masses of two bodies that are replaced by a new body of virtual mass ''M'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The position coordinates '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are replaced by their relative position  '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and by the vector to their center of mass '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt; = (''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)/(''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; +  ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;). The node in the binary tree corresponding to the virtual body has ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; as its right child and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; as its left child. The order of children indicates the relative coordinate points from '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; to '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. Repeat the above step for ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 bodies, that is, the ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 original bodies plus the new virtual body. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the [[N-body problem|''N''-body problem]] the result is:&lt;ref name=Cornille&gt;{{cite book |title=Advanced electromagnetism and vacuum physics |author=Patrick Cornille |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8sSFTDkQ20C&amp;pg=PA102 |chapter=Partition of forces using Jacobi coordinates  |isbn=981-238-367-0 |date=2003 |publisher=World Scientific}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r_N }= \frac{1}{m_{0N}} \sum_{k=1}^N m_k\boldsymbol {x_k} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;m_{0j} = \sum_{k=1}^j \ m_k \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The vector &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{r_N} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[center of mass]] of all the bodies:

The result one is left with is thus a system of ''N''-1 translationally invariant coordinates &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r_1}, \dots, \boldsymbol{r_{N-1}}&lt;/math&gt; and a center of mass coordinate &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r_N}&lt;/math&gt;, from iteratively reducing two-body systems within the many-body system.

The '''K Foundation''' was an art foundation set up by [[Bill Drummond]] and [[Jimmy Cauty]] ([[The KLF]]) in 1993, following their 'retirement' from the music industry. The Foundation served as an artistic outlet for the duo's post-retirement KLF income. Between 1993 and 1995, they spent this money in a number of ways, including on a series of [[Situationist International|Situationist]]-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world, focusing in particular on the [[Turner Prize]]. Most notoriously, when their plans to use [[banknotes]] as part of a work of [[art]] fell through, they [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid|burned a million pounds in cash]].

The K Foundation announced a 23-year [[wiktionary:moratorium|moratorium]] on all projects from November 1995. They further indicated that they would not speak about the burning of the million pounds during the period of this moratorium.

==Context==
In the early 1980s, British musician and artist [[Jimmy Cauty]] was the guitarist in an underachieving pop/rock band, [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]].&lt;ref name="Trouserpress"&gt;[[Ira Robbins|Robbins, I.]], "KLF", ''[[Trouser Press]]'' magazine ([http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=klf link]). Retrieved 20 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Brilliant had been signed to [[Warner Music Group|WEA Records]] by [[A&amp;R]] man [[Bill Drummond]],&lt;ref&gt;LeRoy, D., Brilliant biography, ''[[Allmusic]]'' ([{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p22681/biography|pure_url=yes}} link])&lt;/ref&gt; formerly a member of the Liverpool group [[Big in Japan (band)|Big in Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;"Big in Japan - Where are they now?", ''[[Q Magazine]]'', January 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=271 link])&lt;/ref&gt; the manager of [[The Teardrop Explodes]] and [[Echo &amp; the Bunnymen]],&lt;ref name="TateTat"&gt;"Tate tat and arty", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 20 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=359 link])&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder of the independent record label [[Zoo Records]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon, ''Rip It Up And Start Again: Post-punk 1978-1984'', {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Brilliant released their one and only album - ''[[Kiss The Lips Of Life]]'' - before splitting up.&lt;ref&gt;LeRoy, D., ''Kiss the Lips of Life'' review, ''[[Allmusic]]'' ([{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r55441|pure_url=yes}} link])&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Drummond left WEA Records to record a solo album.&lt;ref name="SpecialK"&gt;Shaw, W., "Special K", ''[[GQ]]'' Magazine, April 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link])&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst out walking on [[New Year's Day]], 1987, Drummond hit upon an idea for a hip-hop record but, he said, knowing "nothing, personally, about the technology", he needed a collaborator. Drummond called Jimmy Cauty who agreed to join him in a new band called [[The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu]] (The JAMs).&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Radio 1]] "Story Of Pop" documentary interview with Bill Drummond. First BBC broadcast believed to have been in [http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/STORY+OF+POP late 1994], and was transmitted by Australian national broadcaster [[Citadel Media|ABC]] on [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/pop/default.htm 1 January 2005]. Transcript taken from the [http://www.klf.de/faq/index.php?cate_id=1 KLF FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427020752/http://www.klf.de/faq/index.php?cate_id=1 |date=27 April 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The JAMs' debut release, the single "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]", was released as an underground [[white label]] on 9 March 1987.&lt;ref name="discog"&gt;Longmire, Ernie et al. [http://www.klf.de/discography/ KLF discography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111071100/http://www.klf.de/discography/ |date=11 January 2008 }} Compiled by Ernie Longmire, this has been the authoritative KLF discography on the internet for some 10 years or more and has been the subject of long-term scrutiny and peer review by KLF fans and collectors. It is now maintained by the fan site klf.de. Retrieved 19 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1991, the duo—now calling themselves [[The KLF]]—had become the best-selling singles band in the world and, according to the ''[[Allmusic]]'', were "on the verge of becoming superstars".&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;Bush, J., KLF biography, ''[[Allmusic]]'' ([{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4694/biography|pure_url=yes}} link])&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, in May 1992 they machine-gunned a music industry audience at the [[BRIT Awards]] (albeit with blanks) and quit the music business.&lt;ref&gt;"[1992] had been the year of Bill's 'breakdown', when The KLF, perched on the peak of greater-than-ever success, quit the music business, (toy) machine gunned the tuxedo'd twats in the front row of that year's BRIT Awards ceremony and dumped a sheep's carcass on the steps at the after-show party." Martin, G., "The Chronicled Mutineers", ''[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]'', December 1996 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=430 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

By their own account, neither Drummond nor Cauty kept any of the money that they made as The KLF; it was all ploughed back into their extravagant productions. Cauty told an Australian ''[[Big Issue]]'' writer in 2003 that all the money they made as The KLF was spent, and that the [[royalties]] they accrued post-retirement amounted to approximately one million pounds:{{cquote|I think we made about £6m. We paid nearly half that in [[tax]] and spent the rest on production costs. When we stopped, the production costs stopped too, so over the next few months we amassed a surplus of cash still coming in from record sales; this amounted to about £1.8m. After tax we were left with about £1m.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, B., interview with Jimmy Cauty for ''[[The Big Issue Australia]]'', 18 June 2003 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=538 link])&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Although the duo had deleted their back catalogue in the UK with immediate effect, international licensees retained the contractual right to distribute KLF recordings for a number of years. The KLF, like any other artist, were also entitled to [[Performing Right Society]] royalties every time one of their songs was played on the radio or television. Rather than spend these earnings or invest them for personal gain, the duo decided the money would be used to fund a new art foundation - The K Foundation.&lt;ref name="Reid"&gt;Reid, J., "Money to burn", ''[[The Observer]]'', 25 September 1994, ''passim'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=387 link])&lt;/ref&gt;  "Having created an artistic machine that created money", said ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'' Magazine, "they [then] invented a machine for destroying it."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, W., "Special K", ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'' Magazine, April 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link])&lt;/ref&gt; Quite what the Foundation, this money-destroying machine, would do with the million pounds plus was still undecided.

Music journalist [[Sarah Champion (journalist)|Sarah Champion]] pointed out (prior to the million pound fire) that, "Being 'in the money' doesn't mean they'll ever be rich. [Drummond and Cauty will] always be [[wiktionary:skint|skint]], but their pranks will get more extravagant. If they earned £10 million, they'd blow it all by buying Jura or a fleet of K Foundation [[airship]]s or a [[Van Gogh]] to be ceremonially burned."&lt;ref name="Trash"&gt;Sharkey, A., "Trash Art &amp; Kreation", ''[[The Guardian|The Guardian Weekend]]'', 21 May 1994&lt;/ref&gt; "There are things we'd like to do which we haven't done.", Drummond told a journalist in 1991. "Totally ludicrous things. We want to buy ships, have submarines. They really are stupid things I know, but I feel confident that in the event of us selling ten million albums we would definitely go out and buy a submarine....Just to be able to say 'Look we've got a submarine and [[808 State]] haven't'."&lt;ref&gt;Morton, R., "One Coronation Under A Groove", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 22 January 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=191 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==K Foundation adverts==
The first manifestation of the K Foundation was a series of adverts in UK national newspapers in 1993. The first adverts, in July 1993, were cryptic, referring to "K Time" and advising readers to "Kick out the clocks".&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("Divide &amp; Kreate"), ''[[The Guardian|Guardian Weekend]]'', 3 July 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=330 link]) and ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 3 July 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=329 link])&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an advert for their single "K Cera Cera" which was "Available nowhere ... no formats" and which was not planned for release until world peace was established. The single was eventually released, but only in Israel.&lt;ref name="KCera"&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("K Cera Cera"), ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 10 July 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=332 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

"When the first in a strange series of full-page ads appeared in The Independent on July 4", said ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'', "people started whispering. The cultish rhetoric, the unfathomable "Divide and Kreate" slogans, the K symbols, all suggested that the kings of cultural anarchy were back."&lt;ref name="Face"&gt;"K Foundation: Nailed To The Wall", ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'', January 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=374 link])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The kings of cultural anarchy" refers, of course, to [[The KLF]].&lt;/ref&gt; Each advert cost between £5,000 and £15,000.&lt;ref name="Times-ads"&gt;Sandall, Robert, "Adding to the confusion; K Foundation's new ads", ''[[The Times]]'' ([[London]]) ISSN 0140-0460 , 12 September 1993, Features section.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turner Prize subversion==
{{main|K Foundation art award}}

The [[K Foundation art award|1994 K Foundation award]] was an award given by the K Foundation to the "worst artist of the year".
The Foundation commissioned more press adverts, instructing readers to "Abandon all art now"&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("Abandon All Art Now"), ''[[The Guardian|Guardian Weekend]]'', 14 August 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=339 link])&lt;/ref&gt; and then inviting them to vote for the worst artist of the year.&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("Let The People Choose"), ''[[The Guardian|Guardian Weekend]]'', 18 September 1993 and ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', 19 September 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 [[Turner Prize]] was being judged at the same time, and, perhaps not coincidentally, both awards had the same shortlist of four artists.&lt;ref&gt;Ezard, J., "Worst art hoaxers' scam goes kaput", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 30 August 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=342 link])&lt;/ref&gt; The prize being offered by Drummond and Cauty was £40,000 which was double the £20,000 offered for the Turner Prize.&lt;ref name="KellyQ"&gt;[[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Kelly, D.]], "Million Dollar Bash", ''[[Q Magazine]]'', February 1994, ''passim'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=377 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Channel 4]] Television broadcast coverage of the Turner Prize, during which three more K Foundation adverts were broadcast &amp;mdash; these announced the "amending of art history".&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation television advertisements, [[Channel 4]], 23 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=516 link])&lt;/ref&gt; During the evening, [[Rachel Whiteread]] was announced as the winner of both the Turner Prize and the K Foundation award. Whiteread initially refused to accept the K Foundation prize, but after being told that the money would be incinerated, she reluctantly accepted, with the intention of donating £30,000 to artists in financial need and the other £10,000 to the housing charity, [[Shelter (charity)|Shelter]].&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;"The Best Of Artists, The Worst of Artists", ''[[New York Times]]'', 29 November 1993([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=366 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="Face"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This was announced in an advertisement placed by Whiteread in ''[[Art Monthly]]'', January 1994. See [[:Image:Rachel Whiteread's K Foundation award advert.jpg]] for a scan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Money: A Major Body of Cash''==
During the buildup to the presentation of the K Foundation art award to Rachel Whiteread on 23 November 1993, the K Foundation presented their first artwork to the press. ''Nailed To A Wall'', "the first of a series of K Foundation art installations that will also include one million pounds in a skip, one million pounds on a table and several variants on the theme of Tremendous Amounts Of Folding", consisted of one million pounds in £50 notes, nailed to a large framed board.&lt;ref name="KellyQ"/&gt; ''Nailed To A Wall'' had a reserve price of £500,000, half the face value of the cash used in its construction, which ''Scotland on Sunday'''s reporter Robert Dawson Scott was "fairly confident... really was £1 million [in cash]". The catalogue entry for the artwork stated: "Over the years the face value will be eroded by inflation, while the artistic value will rise and rise. The precise point at which the artistic value will overtake the face value is unknown. Deconstruct the work now and you double your money. Hang it on a wall and watch the face value erode, the market value fluctuate, and the artistic value soar. The choice is yours."&lt;ref name="DawsonScott"&gt;Dawson Scott, Robert, "K Foundation tries to turn the art world on its head", ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'', 28 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=364 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectively, the K Foundation's money-as-art works were titled ''Money: A Major Body Of Cash'', "seven pieces, all involving various amounts of cash nailed to, tied to or simply standing on inanimate objects".&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt; ''The Face'' magazine neatly summed up the concepts behind the art project:{{cquote|If there is any overriding theme to all this unfathomable rhetoric, it's that money has become the root of all art. The questions posed in the K Foundation's first catalogue all hint at this idea: "How beautiful is money?" "Why do we try and make money measure the immeasurable?" "Have you ever [[wiktionary:shag#Etymology 3|shagged]] somebody who works in a bank?" In short, "What is money?"

To add further weight to this theory, they also pull off a neat conceptual punchline. Their art is made out of cash. The face value of that cash is obvious. The artistic value, until somebody buys it and gives it artistic status, is zero. The K Foundation have put a price on these works precisely halfway between their current monetary value and their artistic value. The joke being that if you were to buy the piece called 10,000 (four piles of mint fifties nailed to a plank of salvaged skirting board) for the asking price of 5,000 (ono), you stand to pocket five grand if you destroy the art and spend the money. Alternatively, hang it on your wall and see the cash value eroded by inflation while the artistic value soars. It's the sale of the century!&lt;ref name="Face"/&gt;}}

During the first half of 1994, the K Foundation attempted to interest galleries in staging ''Money: A Major Body Of Cash''. However, even old friend [[Jayne Casey]], director of the Liverpool Festival Trust, was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate. "'The [[Tate Liverpool|Tate, in Liverpool]], wanted to be part of the 21st Century Festival I'm involved with,' says Casey. 'I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, but they seemed nervous about the personalities involved.' A curt fax from... the gallery curator, informed Casey that the K Foundation's exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly",&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt; leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former [[Soviet Union]] by train and on to the United States, but no insurer would touch the project. Then an exhibition at [[Dublin]]'s [[Kilmainham Jail]] was considered. No sooner had a provisional date of August been set for the exhibition, however, when the duo changed their minds yet again. "Jimmy said: 'Why don't we just burn it?' remembers Drummond. 'He said it in a light-hearted way, I suppose, hoping I'd say: 'No, we can't do that, let's do this...' But it seemed the most powerful thing to do."&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt; Cauty: "We were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were going to spend the money on and then we decided it would be better if we burned it. That was about six weeks before we did it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare."&lt;ref name="NMEScreening"&gt;"We didn't set out to make a film, we set out to burn 1m", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 16 September 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=463 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The K Foundation Burn a Million Quid''==
{{Main|K Foundation Burn a Million Quid}}
On 23 August 1994, in a boathouse on the Scottish island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], Drummond and Cauty incinerated £1,000,000 in cash.&lt;ref&gt;"One million [[wiktionary:quid|Quid]]" in [[British slang]]&lt;/ref&gt; The burning was witnessed by an old friend of Drummond's, freelance journalist Jim Reid, who subsequently wrote an article about the ceremony for ''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt; It was filmed on [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] by their friend [[Alan Goodrick|Gimpo]].

Reid admitted to first feeling shock and guilt about the burning, which quickly turned to boredom. The money took well over an hour to burn as Drummond and Cauty fed £50 notes into the fire. Drummond later said that only about £900,000 of the money was actually burnt &amp;ndash; the rest flew straight up the chimney.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, D., "It's not haute cuisine", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 May 2004 ([https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1220512,00.html link])&lt;/ref&gt;  The press reported that an islander handed £1,500 into the police; the money had not been claimed and would be returned to the finder.&lt;ref&gt;Bowditch, G., "Duo with £1m to burn leave island guessing", ''[[The Times]]'', 4 October 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=389 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKerron, I., "Duo Burn £1M In Midnight Madness", ''[[Daily Express]]'', 1 October 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=388 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August 1995, exactly one year after the burning, Drummond and Cauty returned to Jura for the premier screening of the film,&lt;ref&gt;Banks-Smith, Nancy, "From cash to ash", ''[[The Guardian]]'' ([[Manchester]]), 30 August 1995, page T.009&lt;/ref&gt; now known as ''[[Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid]]''. The film was then toured around the UK over the next few months (plus one showing in [[Belgrade]]), with a Q&amp;A session at the end of each screening where members of the audience asked Drummond and Cauty why they burnt the money and also offered their own interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [[John Harris (critic)|Harris, John]], "Who wants to be a millionaire?", ''[[Q Magazine]]'', November 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=400 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moratorium==
Drummond and Cauty announced a [[wiktionary:moratorium|moratorium]] on K Foundation activities in the obscure "[[The Workshop for Non-linear Architecture]]" bulletin of November 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stewart Home|Home, Stewart]], "There's no success like failure", ''[[Variant magazine|Variant]]'', Volume 2 Number 1 (Winter 1996), p18 ([http://www.variant.randomstate.org/pdfs/issue1/success.pdf#search=%22%22k%20foundation%22%20moratorium%22 link])&lt;/ref&gt; The duo had signed a "[[contract]]", agreeing to wind up the K Foundation and not to speak about the money burning for a period of 23 years. The document was signed on the [[hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] of a rented car which, they claim, they then pushed over the cliffs at [[Cape Wrath]]. This was followed on 8 December 1995 by an advertisement in ''[[The Guardian]]'':{{cquote|On 5 November 1995, Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond signed a contract with the rest of the world agreeing to end the K Foundation for a period of 23 years.

This postponement provides opportunity of sufficient length for an accurate and appropriately executed response to their 'burning of a million quid'. The K Foundation's fate now lies irrevocably sealed in the imploded remains of a [[Nissan Bluebird]] nestling among the rocks 600 feet below Cape Wrath, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("Cape Wrath"), ''[[The Guardian]] (G2)'', 8 December 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=519 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that they have spoken about the burning since then to a limited extent (references can be found in [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid]], including quotations from Drummond where he expresses regret at burning the money); the "contract" has not been as strictly followed as The KLF's stated intention to delete their back catalogue in 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In November 1995, the BBC aired an edition of the ''[[Omnibus (BBC)|Omnibus]]'' documentary series about The K Foundation entitled "A Foundation Course in Art".&lt;ref&gt;Reviewed by Sutcliffe, Thomas, ''[[The Independent]]'' ([[London]]) ISSN 0951-9467 , 7 November 1995, TV section p24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final act of the K Foundation was distributing a van load of [[Tennent's Super]] - a high-alcohol-content lager - to London's [[drinking in public|street drinkers]] on [[Christmas Day]] 1995. &lt;!-- Recalling The JAMs' 1987 single, ''[[Down Town]]'', this was the second occasion in which Cauty and Drummond juxtaposed the spirit of Christmas with the plight of the urban alcoholic homeless. : Maybe, but we need a source to make the connection --&gt; However, the Foundation discovered that their choice of location for this endeavour — near [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]] on the [[South Bank]] — was unusually devoid of homeless people, many of whom were in homeless shelters for the day. "That was a pity", said Jimmy Cauty. "If you are down-and-out, would you rather have a bowl of soup or a can of Tennent's?"&lt;ref&gt;"English charity gives out beer to London's ranks of homeless", ''[[San Jose Mercury]]'', 26 December 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=412 link])&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sunday Times'' later called the scheme "ethically dubious".&lt;ref&gt;Heaney, Mick, "Bill Drummond once burnt Pounds 1m for art's sake. Now he is taking a soupopera to Belfast", ''[[Sunday Times]]'' ([[London]]), 18 April 2004, p18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond and Cauty would next work together in 1997, when they attempted to "[[Fuck the Millennium]]" as [[2K (band)|2K]] (music) and [[K2 Plant Hire]] (conceptual art).

==K Cera Cera and The Magnificent==
The only music release to bear the name of the K Foundation was "[[K Cera Cera]]", released as a limited edition single in Israel and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in November 1993. An amalgam of "[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)]]" and [[John Lennon]]/[[Yoko Ono]]'s "[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]", it was credited to the "K Foundation presents The [[MVD Ensemble|Red Army Choir]]". Originally intended for release when "world peace [is] established" (i.e. never) and in "no formats",&lt;ref name="KCera"/&gt; the Israeli release was made "In acknowledgement of the recent brave steps taken by the Israeli Government and the [[Palestinian Liberation Organisation]] (PLO)".&lt;ref&gt;K Cera Cera sleevenotes&lt;/ref&gt; Said Drummond: "Our idea was to create awareness of peace in the world. Because we were worried it would be interpreted by the public as an attempt by The KLF to return to the music world on the back of a humanist gimmick, we decided to hide behind the Foundation."&lt;ref&gt;"Yasser, they can boogie!", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 13 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=356 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Also made by the duo during the K Foundation's existence, reported by the ''NME'' as a K Foundation work, but officially attributed to "The [[One World Orchestra]] featuring The Massed Pipes and Drums of the Children's Free Revolutionary Volunteer Guards", was "[[The Magnificent (song)|The Magnificent]]", their contribution to the charity album ''[[The Help Album|Help]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs.com entry for "One World Orchestra, The" ([http://www.discogs.com/artist/One+World+Orchestra,+The discogs.com link])&lt;/ref&gt; The song, a [[drum'n'bass]] version of the theme tune from ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' with vocal samples from [[Fleka|DJ Fleka]] of Serbian radio station [[B92]], was recorded on 4 September 1995. On 5 September 1995, Drummond and Cauty claimed they would "never make any more records". Drummond said,  "What do you expect us to do, go and make a jungle record?"; Cauty added "Yeah, like a jungle novelty record with some strings on it or something. It would just be sad wouldn't it? We're too old." ''NME'' gleefully informed their readers, "The K Foundation's contribution to the 'Help' LP is a jungle track."&lt;ref name="NMEScreening"/&gt; ''Help'' was released on 9 September 1995.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2814">{{about|the Nietzche concept|other uses|The Last Man (disambiguation)}}
The '''last man''' ({{lang-de|Letzter Mensch}}) is a term used by the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' to describe the antithesis of his imagined superior being, the ''[[Übermensch]]'', whose imminent appearance is heralded by Zarathustra. The last man is tired of life, takes no risks, and seeks only comfort and security. 

The last man's primary appearance is in "Zarathustra's Prologue." According to Nietzsche, the last man is the goal that modern society and Western civilization have apparently set for themselves.  After having unsuccessfully attempted to get the populace to accept the ''Übermensch'' as the goal of society, Zarathustra confronts them with a goal so disgusting that he assumes that it will revolt them.&lt;ref&gt;''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', Prologue, §5.&lt;/ref&gt; Zarathustra fails in this attempt, and instead of repelling and manipulating the populace into pursuing the goal of the Übermensch, the populace take Zarathustra literally and choose the "disgusting" goal of becoming the last men. This decision leaves Zarathustra disheartened and disappointed.

The lives of the last men are pacifist and comfortable. There is no longer a distinction between ruler and ruled, strong over weak or supreme over the mediocre. Social conflict and challenges are minimized. Every individual lives equally and in "superficial" harmony. There are no original or flourishing social trends and ideas. Individuality and creativity are suppressed. 

Nietzsche warned that the society of the last man could be too barren and decadent to support the growth of healthy human life or great individuals. The last man is only possible by mankind having bred an apathetic person or ethnic group who are unable to dream, who are unwilling to take risks, and simply earn their living and keep warm. The society of the last man is antithetical to Nietzsche's theoretical [[will to power]], the main driving force and ambition behind human nature, according to Nietzsche, as well as all other life in the universe.  

The last man, Nietzsche predicted, would be one response to the problem of [[nihilism]]. But the full implications of the [[God is dead|death of God]] had yet to unfold: "The event itself is far too great, too distant, too remote from the multitude's capacity for comprehension even for the tidings of it to be thought of as having arrived as yet."&lt;ref&gt;''Gay Science'', §343&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson was arrested several times on unrelated charges over the following years.  In a third trial for Rosenbaum's murder, Nelson was convicted of violating Rosenbaum's [[civil rights]] in the murder, and served a 10-year sentence. Nelson admitted for the first time at his 2003 trial that he had stabbed Rosenbaum.

His mother, who reportedly suffered from mental illness, repeatedly tried to [[Abortion|abort]] him before he was born. As an infant, he lived with his mother at a shelter for battered women. Nelson's earliest memories involved a physical altercation between his father and mother.

===Murder trial (1992)===
Nelson was tried on charges of murder as a hate crime in a New York state court in 1992. Nelson pleaded not guilty to the charge and denied stabbing Rosenbaum.&lt;ref name="nytimes2003"&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman |first=Andy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/15/nyregion/the-crown-heights-verdict-overview-mixed-verdict-on-crown-hts-defense-happy.html?ref=lemrick_jr_nelson |title=The Crown Heights Verdict – Overview – Mixed Verdict On Crown Hts. – Defense Happy |location=|newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 15, 2003 |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police testified that Nelson had confessed to murdering Rosenbaum to police officers.&lt;ref name="nytimesOct1992"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/31/opinion/the-crown-heights-acquittal.html?ref=lemrick_jr_nelson |title=The Crown Heights Acquittal |location=New York City; Crown Heights (Nyc) |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 31, 1992 |accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors claimed Nelson had been carrying a blood-stained knife inscribed with the word "KilleR" at the time he was arrested, but Nelson's defense denied the knife was his and suggested police officers had found it elsewhere. No evidence of fingerprints on the knife was presented.&lt;ref name="nytimesOct1992"/&gt; Despite media reports that the pants Nelson had been wearing at the time of his arrest had been bloody,&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Books.google.com"/&gt; prosecutors did not present evidence of bloodstains upon Nelson's clothing.&lt;ref name="nytimesOct1992"/&gt;

Nelson was acquitted of murder on October 29, 1992.&lt;ref name="nytimesOct1992"/&gt; The racial composition of the jury (which was considered relevant in the context of the racially charged atmosphere) is unclear: some contemporary reports described the jury as having consisted of six black jurors, four Hispanic jurors and two white jurors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47165/ |title='The New Anti-Semitism' |date=January 11, 1993 |work=New York Magazine |accessdate=October 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later reports described the jury as having consisted of eight black jurors, two white jurors and two Guyanese Americans of undisclosed race&lt;ref name="nytimes2003"/&gt; or as being "predominantly black".&lt;ref name="DF-ZMgBPEVMC 2010, p. 50"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DF-ZMgBPEVMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+American+Criminal+Justice+System:+How+It+Works,+How+It+Doesn't,+and+How+to+Fix+It&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MDBPTMK9A4P78AaGx53ZDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Gerhard Falk, ''The American Criminal Justice System: How It Works, How It Doesn't, and How to Fix It''], ABC-CLIO, 2010, p. 50.

===Violation of civil rights trials (1997 and 2003)===

In 1997, Nelson was convicted in federal court of violating Rosenbaum's civil rights. However, that verdict was vacated on appeal due to unfairness in the jury selection process.&lt;ref name="nytimes2003"/&gt;

A retrial was held in 2003. There were two primary issues of contention: whether Nelson's actions had been motivated by prejudice and whether Nelson's actions caused Rosenbaum's death.

In a departure from his position in the 1992 trial, Nelson admitted to having stabbed Rosenbaum and apologized to Rosenbaum's family for his actions.&lt;ref name="Gourevitch"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Philip |last=Gourevitch |journal=The Jewish Forward |date=January 1993 |url=http://www.ex-iwp.org/docs/1993/Crown+Heights+Riot+Aftermath.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205030339/http://ex-iwp.org/docs/1993/Crown%2BHeights%2BRiot%2BAftermath.htm/ |archivedate=December  5, 2013 |title=The Crown Heights Riot &amp; Its Aftermath |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805EFDB1F30F932A1575BC0A9659C8B63|title=Penalty in Crown Hts.

On the issue of whether Nelson caused Rosenbaum's death, medical evidence was presented indicating that Rosenbaum had been stabbed four times, of which two of the wounds were fatal.&lt;ref name="pqasb.pqarchiver.com"&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/337008331.html?dids=337008331:337008331&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+15%2C+2003&amp;author=KATI+CORNELL+SMITH&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;desc=LEMRICK+GUILTY+-+BUT+HE+FACES+ONLY+2+YEARS+IN+JAIL&amp;pqatl=google "Lemrick Guilty – but he faces only 2 years in jail"], by Kati Cornell Smith, ''[[New York Post]]'', May 15, 2003. Retrieved July 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2003, the jury found Nelson guilty of violating Rosenbaum's civil rights, but he was not found to have caused Rosenbaum's death.&lt;ref name="pqasb.pqarchiver.com"/&gt; According to [[Cornell University Law School|Cornell]] law professor Sherry Colb, the jury's verdict was "logically incoherent." Rosenbaum's family had filed a malpractice suit against the hospital where he died.  The jury was supposed to—but did not—ignore this information in determining Nelson's guilt, reasoning that the hospital and Nelson could not both be guilty. Colb writes that "this line of reasoning can most generously be described as misguided and less generously as stupid."&lt;ref&gt;Sherry F. Colb, [http://writ.news.findlaw.com/colb/20030604.html ''The Verdict in the Lemrick Nelson Trial: Jury Deliberations Expose a Troubling Reality''], June 4, 2003, in FindLaw.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson was subsequently sentenced to the maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; He served the full sentence (including time served before his 2003 trial) and was released on June 2, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/06/03/2004-06-03_lemrick_nelson_s_out_of_jail.html|author=John Marzulli and Dave Godiner|title=Lemrick Nelson's Out of Jail |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |date=June 3, 2004 |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 2010 interview with the ''[[New York Post]]'', Nelson indicated that he had stopped drinking; he said he considered stabbing Rosenbaum a "mistake" he made as "a kid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein |first=Joseph |url=http://www.nypost.com/f/news/local/brooklyn/crown_hts_thug_new_life_RRn9y1S44iYOFPMgRUt3zI |title=Crown Heights riot figure Lemrick Nelson lives quietly in Hillside, New Jersey |newspaper=New York Post |date=May 16, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and social reaction===
According to ''[[New York Magazine]]'', Nelson's initial acquittal fueled anger at Mayor [[David Dinkins]], with Dinkins becoming "a surrogate for Lemrick Nelson", in part because of Dinkins's support for the verdict, saying "I have no doubt that in this case the criminal-justice system has operated fairly and openly."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o-QCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=The+Politics+of+grievance:+Dinkins,+the+Blacks,+and+the+Jews,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jU7UsUaRHT&amp;sig=v27SvnpDJadVdmmA6yep6ZfL8c0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RQivTNf_H4H48Ab38pWfCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=surrogate&amp;f=false "The Politics of grievance: Dinkins, the Blacks, and the Jews"], ''New York Magazine'', December 7, 1992, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Edward Shapiro, professor of history at [[Seton Hall University]], "it is possible that David Dinkins would have been re-elected mayor in 1993 had the jury not exonerated Lemrick Nelson on October 29, 1992." Shapiro has called the riot "the most serious anti-Semitic incident in American history".&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=StQXz-ClGuUC |accessdate=October 20, 2007 |last=Shapiro |first=Edward S. |year=2006 |title=Crown heights: Blacks, Jews, and the 1991 Brooklyn riot |location=[[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], [[Massachusetts]] |publisher=[[Brandeis University]] Press, [[University Press of New England]]|page=xi|isbn=1-58465-561-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggravated assault and weapon charges (1994)===
Nelson was charged in January 1994 with [[aggravated assault]] for slashing Erik Heard, a high school classmate, because Heard had reported to school officials that Nelson had stolen money from another classmate.

'''Civil rights leaders''' are influential figures in the promotion and implementation of [[political freedom]] and the expansion of personal [[civil liberties]] and [[civil rights|rights]]. They work to protect individuals and groups from [[political repression]] and [[discrimination]] by governments and private organizations, and seek to ensure the ability of all members of society to participate in the civil and political life of the [[State (polity)|state]]. 

Civil rights include [[individual rights]] to equal protection and service, [[privacy]], [[freedom of thought]], [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of movement|freedom to travel]], [[freedom of religion|freedom of worship]], protection of [[civil liberties]], the [[right to vote]], and the right to freely share ideas and opinions through all forms of communication and [[freedom of the press|media]].

People who motivated themselves and then led others to gain and protect these rights and liberties include:

{{masculism sidebar}}
'''Masculism''' or '''masculinism''' may variously refer to advocacy of the rights or needs of [[Man|men]] and [[boy]]s; and the adherence to or promotion of attributes (opinions, values, attitudes, habits) regarded as typical of men and boys.&lt;ref name="BunninYu2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Ferrell|editor=Ted Honderich|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ii8AAAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reason&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''|title=Man Troubles: Making Sense of the Men's Movement|author=[[Cathy Young]]|date=July 1994|url=http://reason.com/archives/1994/07/01/man-troubles|quote=Masculism (mas'kye liz*'em), n. 1. the belief that equality between the sexes requires the recognition and redress of prejudice and discrimination against men as well as women. 2. the movement organized around this belief. References Warren Farrell, Jack Kammer, and others activists in the men's movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition and scope==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) defines ''masculism'', or synonymously ''masculinism'', as the "advocacy of the rights of men; adherence to or promotion of opinions, values, etc., regarded as typical of men; (more generally) anti-feminism, machismo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=masculism, n|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=3rd |year=2000|accessdate=2015-02-17|quote=masculism, n. †1. The possession of masculine physical traits by a woman. Obs. rare. 2. = masculinism n.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oedMasculinism"&gt;{{cite web|title=masculinism, n|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=3rd |year=2000|accessdate=2015-02-17|quote=masculinism, n. Advocacy of the rights of men; adherence to or promotion of opinions, values, etc., regarded as typical of men; (more generally) anti-feminism, machismo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, philosopher Ferrell Christensen differentiates "masculism" from "masculinism", defining the latter as promoting the attributes of manliness.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; 
Political scientist Georgia Duerst-Lahti also distinguishes the two terms, with masculism expressing the ethos of the early gender-egalitarian [[men's movement]], while masculinism refers to the ideology of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Duerst-Lahti | first = Georgia | contribution = Gender Ideology: masculinism and femininalism |pages=159&amp;ndash;192 |editor1-last=Goertz |editor1-first=Gary |editor2-last=Mazur |editor2-first=Amy G. |title=Politics, gender, and concepts: theory and methodology |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521723428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dupuis-Déri2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dupuis-Déri|first1=Francis|title=Le " masculinisme ": une histoire politique du mot (en Anglais et en Français)| trans-title = “Masculinism”: a political history of the term (in English and French) |journal=Recherches Féministes |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=97&amp;ndash;123 |url =https://doi.org/10.7202/039213ar |date=2009 |doi=10.7202/039213ar | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen differentiates between "progressive masculism" and an "extremist version". The former welcomes many of the societal changes promoted by feminists, while believing that some measures reducing sexism against women have increased it against men.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; Nicholas Davidson, in his book ''The Failure of Feminism'', describes an extremist version of masculism which he termed "virism": "What ails society is 'effeminacy'. The improvement of society requires that the influence of female values be decreased and the influence of male values increased…."&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson1988"&gt;Christensen, Ferrell (2005), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WbkSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA562 Masculism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Honderich | editor-first = Ted | title = The Oxford companion to philosophy |pages=562&amp;ndash;563 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | isbn = 9780199264797 }}
* ''Citing'': {{cite book | last = Davidson | first = Nicholas | title = The failure of feminism |page=274 | publisher = Prometheus Books | location = Buffalo, New York | year = 1988 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pf8pAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA274 | isbn = 9780879754082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Gender theory|Gender theories]], which have frequently focused on woman-based or feminist approaches, have come to examine oppression in a masculist society also from the perspectives of men, many of whom are also subjected by that society.&lt;ref name="HoogensenSolheim2006"&gt;Hoogensen, Gunhild; Solheim, Bruce Olav (2006), "[https://books.google.com/?id=ZPThCTMVsZQC&amp;pg=PA21 Women in theory and practice]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Hoogensen | editor-first1 = Gunhild | editor-last2 = Solheim | editor-first2 = Bruce Olav |title=Women in power: world leaders since 1960|year=2006|page=21|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275981907}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a feminist perspective to philosophy, masculinism seeks to value and include only male views, and claim "that anything that cannot be reduced or translated in men's experience should be excluded from the subject-matter of philosophy.&lt;ref name="BunninYu2008"/&gt;

===Education and employment===

Data from the U.S. in 1994 reported that men suffer 94% of workplace fatalities. Masculist [[Warren Farrell]] has argued that men do a disproportionate share of dirty, physically demanding, and hazardous jobs.&lt;ref name=reason/&gt;

===Violence and suicide===

===Custody===
{{main|Fathers' rights movement}}
According to [[David Benatar]], head of philosophy at the [[University of Cape Town]], "Custody law is perhaps the best-known area of men's rights activism", as it is more likely in most parts of the world for the mother to obtain custody of children in case of divorce. He argues: "When the man is the primary care-giver his chances of winning custody are lower than when the woman is the primary care-giver. Even when the case is not contested by the mother, he's still not as likely to get custody as when the woman's claim is uncontested".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = de Castella | first = Tom | title = Just who are men's rights activists? | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17907534 | work = [[BBC News Online#Features|BBC News Magazine]] | date = May 2, 2012 | access-date = May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== South African masculist evangelical movements ==
In the wake of the abolition of apartheid, South Africa has seen a resurgence of masculist Christian evangelical groups, led by two complementary men's and women's movements, the Mighty Men movement and the Worthy Women movement.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadar | first1 = Sarojini | last2 = Potgieter | first2 = Cheryl | title = Liberated through submission?: The Worthy Woman's Conference as a case study of for''men''ism | journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 141&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Project MUSE]] | date = Fall 2010 | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/394797 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mighty Men movement harkens back to the Victorian idea of Muscular Christianity&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dube | first = Siphiwe | title = Muscular Christianity in contemporary South Africa: The case of the Mighty Men Conference | journal = HTS [[Theological Studies/Teologiese Studies]] | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;9 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = July 2015 | url = https://hts.org.za/index.php/HTS/article/view/2945/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the movement does not lead discussions about institutionalized racism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dube | first = Siphiwe | title = Race, whiteness and transformation in the Promise Keepers America and the Mighty Men Conference: A comparative analysis | journal = HTS [[Theological Studies/Teologiese Studies]] | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;8 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = November 2016 | url = http://www.hts.org.za/index.php/HTS/article/view/3476/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholars argue that the movement's lack of attention to women's rights and their historical struggle with racial equality makes it a threat to women and to the stability of the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Scholar Miranda Pillay argues that the Mighty Men movement appeal lies in its resistance to gender equality as incompatible with Christian values, and in raising patriarchy to a "hyper-normative status," beyond challenge by other claims to power.&lt;ref&gt;Pillay, Miranda (2015), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yMTSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61 Mighty Men, Mighty Families: A pro-family Christian movement to (re)enforce patriarchal control?]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Conradie | editor-first1 = Ernst M. | editor-last2=Pillay| editor-first2=Miranda| title = Ecclesial reform and deform movements in the South African context | pages = 61&amp;ndash;77 | publisher = African SUN MeDIA | location = Stellenbosch, South Africa | isbn = 9781920689766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Worthy Women movement is a women's auxiliary to Mighty Men in advocating ''men''ism, a belief in the inherent superiority of men over women.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter" /&gt; Their leader is Gretha Wiid. She blames South Africa's disorder on the liberation of women, and aims to restore the nation through its families, making women again subservient to their men.&lt;ref&gt;Nortjé-Meyer, Lilly (2015), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yMTSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 A movement seeking to embody support of patriarchal structures and patterns in church and society: Gertha Wiid's Worthy Women movement]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Conradie | editor-first1 = Ernst M. | editor-last2=Pillay| editor-first2=Miranda| title = Ecclesial reform and deform movements in the South African context | pages = 86&amp;ndash;93 | publisher = African SUN MeDIA | location = Stellenbosch, South Africa | isbn = 9781920689766}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her success is attributed to her balancing claims that God created the gender hierarchy, but that women are no less valuable than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nortjé-Meyer | first = Lilly | title = A critical analysis of Gretha Wiid’s sex ideology and her biblical hermeneutics | journal = Verbum et Ecclesia | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;7 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = November 2011 | url = http://verbumetecclesia.org.za/index.php/VE/article/view/472/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that restoration of traditional gender roles relieves existential anxiety in post-apartheid South Africa.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter"/&gt;

===Feminism===
Some masculinists have been described as explicitly antifeminist by feminist activists.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; According to Blais and Dupuis-Déri, "the contents of [masculinist] websites and the testimony of feminists that we questioned confirm that masculinists are generally critical of even moderate feminists and feminists at the head of official feminist organizations."&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Some masculinist activism has involved disruption of events organized by feminists and lawsuits against feminist academics, journalists, or activists.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Furthermore, masculinist actions are sometimes extreme; father's rights activists have bombed family courts in Australia and have issued bomb threats in the UK, although it is ambiguous whether there was public and organized militant group involvement.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; They have also engaged in "tire-slashing, the mailing of excrement-filled packages, threats against politicians and their children."&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Spokesmen for these groups have also spoken out against public awareness campaigns to prevent sexual assault, arguing that they portray a negative image of men, and one masculinist group harassed administrators of dozens of battered women's shelters and women's centers.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Martin | first1 = Janet M. | last2 = Borrelli | first2 = Maryanne | title = The other elites: Women, politics, and power in the Executive Branch | publisher = Lynne Rienner Publishers | location = Boulder, Colorado | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781555879716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Philosopher Ferrell Christensen states that if masculism and feminism refer to the belief that men/women are systematically discriminated against, and that this discrimination should be eliminated, there is not necessarily a conflict between feminism and masculism, and some assert that they are both.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; However, many believe that one sex is more discriminated against, and thus use one label and reject the other.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt;

{{IAST|'''''Micchāmi Dukkaḍaṃ''''' (मिच्छामि दुक्कडम्)}} is an ancient Indian phrase, which is translated from [[Prakrit]] to literally mean "may all the evil that has been done be fruitless." &lt;ref name=cha&gt;Chapple. C.K. (2006) ''Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life'' Delhi:Motilal Banarasidas Publ. {{ISBN|978-81-208-2045-6}} p.46&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used to seek forgiveness and to mean, "If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or deed, then I seek your forgiveness."&lt;ref name=iex/&gt; 

It is used widely in [[Jainism|the Jain religion]] on the last day ([[Samvatsari]] or [[Kshamavani]]) of [[Paryushana]], the most important annual holy event of the Jain calendar.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/13/stories/2007091353590500.htm|title=Jains pray for peace, brotherhood |author=|date=2007-09-13|accessdate= 2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jyoga/&gt; As a matter of ritual, Jains greet their friends and relatives on this last day with ''Micchāmi Dukkaḍaṃ'', seeking their forgiveness. No private quarrel or dispute should be carried beyond this time. The importance of forgiveness in [[Jainism]] may be compared to the importance of [[Forgiveness|forgiveness in other religions]].

At the end of the festival [[Paryushana]], devotees request forgiveness for any offenses committed during the year by saying ‘Micchami Dukkadam’ or ‘Uttam Kshama’ meaning “If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or deed, then I seek your forgiveness.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/webspecial/paryushana-2017-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-jain-festival-of-forgiveness/1123051|title=Paryushana 2017: All you need to know about the Jain festival of forgiveness {{!}} Free Press Journal|date=2017-08-17|work=Free Press Journal|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
''micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ'' is most commonly used on the last day (''[[Samvatsari]]'') of one of the most holy annual Jain events, [[Paryushana]]. After ''[[pratikramana]]'' (Jain prayer, literally meaning "introspection"), [[Jainism|Jains]] seek forgiveness from almost all the creatures of the world whom they may have harmed knowingly or unknowingly by uttering the phrase—''micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ''.&lt;ref name=iex&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Indian Express]]|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Request-for-Forgiveness/355457/|title=Request for Forgiveness|author=Preeti Srivastav|date=2008-08-31|accessdate=2009-11-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001054813/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Request-for-Forgiveness/355457/|archivedate=2012-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jainism: the world of conquerors, (Vol. 1)|author=Natubhai Shah|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|year=1998 |isbn=1-898723-30-3 |page=212 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EmVzvUzbwegC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=Michchhami+Dukkadam&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZoRfTrdWzdCtB4yixLUP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Michchhami%20Dukkadam&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paryushana]] frequently falls in August or September during [[Chaturmas|Cāturmāsa]], four months into the rainy season. This annual holy time for [[Jainism|Jains]] is reserved for prayers, meditation, introspection, penance, and fasting. Even the wandering monks temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst laymen, giving discourses and organizing scriptural recitations.&lt;ref name=jyoga/&gt;

Traditionally, letters were sent and telephone calls made to friends and relatives asking their forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, James (2003), Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Part 10, Kessinger Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-7661-3682-3}} p.876&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The phrase ''michchāmi dukkaḍaṃ'' is also found in the ''Airyapathiki Sutra''.&lt;ref name=jyoga/&gt; It literally means — may all the evil that has been done be fruitless, and comes from the [[Prakrit]] language, a [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|middle Indo-Aryan language,]] closely linked with [[Pali]] and used abundantly in the Prakrit canon of [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name=cha/&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The [[Sanskrit]] version''(chayā)'' of the phrase is ''mithyā me duṣkṛitām'' meaning "may the evil of it be in vain".&lt;ref name=jyoga&gt;{{cite book |title=Jaina yoga: a survey of the mediaeval śrāvakācāras|author= R.

''mithyā'' refers to 'being fruitless' or 'getting absolved of'. ''me'' refers to 'my'. ''duṣkṛitām'' refers to 'bad deeds'.

'''Modesty''', sometimes known as '''demureness''', is a mode of dress and deportment which intends to avoid the encouraging of [[sexual attraction]] in others. The word "modesty" comes from the Latin word ''[[wikt:modestus|modestus]]'' which means "keeping within measure".&lt;ref name="Jennett, Sheila 2001"&gt;Jennett, Sheila. The Oxford companion to the body. Eds. Colin Blakemore, and Sheila Jennett. Vol. 7. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Standards of modesty are culturally and context dependent and vary widely. In this use, it may be considered inappropriate or immodest to reveal certain parts of the body. In some societies, modesty may involve women covering their bodies completely and not talking to men who are not immediate family members; in others, a fairly revealing but [[One-piece swimsuit|one-piece bathing costume]] is considered modest when other women wear [[bikini]]s. In some countries, exposure of the body in breach of community standards of modesty is also considered to be public indecency, and [[public nudity]] is generally illegal in most of the world and regarded as [[indecent exposure]]. For example, [[Stephen Gough]] a lone man attempting to walk naked from south to north Britain was repeatedly imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3182771.stm|title=Naked rambler vows to walk on|author=|date=26 August 2003|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nudity is at times tolerated in some societies; for example, during a [[World Naked Bike Ride]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2012/jun/10/world-naked-bike-ride-pictures Guardian newspaper: World Naked Bike Ride – in pictures, 10 June 2012] While most of the riders are naked, all the photographs in this series obscure details by strategically places handlebars.&lt;/ref&gt;

In semi-public contexts standards of modesty vary. Nudity may be acceptable in public single-sex [[changing room]]s at [[swimming bath]]s, for example, or for mass [[medical examination]] of men for [[military service]]. In private, standards again depend upon the circumstances. A person who would never disrobe in the presence of a [[physician]] of the opposite sex in a social context might unquestioningly do so for a medical examination; others might allow examination, but only by a person of the same sex.

==Body==
[[File:1868-skirt-lengths-girl-ages-Harpers-Bazar.gif|thumb|upright=0.72|1868 diagram from ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' showing proper girls' skirt lengths increasing as they grow up.]]

Standards of modesty discourage or forbid exposure of parts of the [[Human body|body]], varying between societies, which may include areas of [[skin]], the [[hair]], [[undergarments]], and [[intimate parts]].  The standards may also require obscuring the shape of the body or parts of it by wearing non-[[form-fitting clothing]]. There are also customs regarding the changing of clothes (such as on a [[beach]] with no enclosed facilities), and the closing or locking of the door when changing or taking a [[shower]].

Standards of modesty vary by culture or generation and vary depending on who is exposed, which parts of the body are exposed, the duration of the exposure, the context, and other variables.  The categories of persons who could see another's body could include:
* a spouse or partner,
* a [[friendship|friend]] or [[family]] member of the same sex,
* strangers of the same sex

The context would include matters such as whether it is in one's own home, at another family member's home, at a friend's home, at a semi-public place, at a [[beach]], [[swimming pool]] (including whether such venues are considered [[dress code|clothes-optional]]), [[changing room]]s or other public places. For instance, wearing a [[bathing suit]] at the beach would not be considered immodest, while it likely would be in a street or an office.

Excessive modesty is called [[prude|prudishness]]. As a medical condition, it is also called [[gymnophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12335|title=Definition of Gymnophobia|last=|first=|date=|website=MedicineNet.com|publisher=MedicineNet.com|access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive ''immodesty'' is called [[exhibitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypersexualdisorders.com/hypersexual-disorders/dsm-5-understanding-exhibitionistic-disorder/|title=DSM 5: Understanding Exhibitionistic Disorder|last=|first=|date=21 June 2013|website=Hypersexual Disorders|publisher=Elements Behavioral Health|access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modesty in medical settings==
{{main|Modesty in medical settings}}

At times of public or private [[emergency]], expectations of modest dress may be suspended if necessary. For example, during suspected [[anthrax]] attacks in 1998 and 2001 in the [[United States]], groups of people had to strip to their underwear in tents set up in parking lots and other public places for hosing down by fire departments.&lt;ref name="archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com"&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=nude25&amp;date=20020525|title=We'd rather die than take our clothes off, disaster planners say|author=Dru Sefton|date=25 May 2002|newspaper=Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, even in an emergency situation, some people are unable to abandon their need to hide their bodies, even at the risk of their life.&lt;ref name="archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com"/&gt; This may apply to decontamination after a chemical or biological attack, where removal of contaminated clothing is important, or escaping from a night-time fire without time to dress.

==In dress==
[[File:Immodest ukrainians bangladesh.jpg|thumb|Three [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] men, wearing [[Trunks (clothing)|trunks]] and [[Swim briefs|briefs]], attract attention for immodesty relative to the local norm in [[Cox's Bazar|Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh]].]]

Most discussion of modesty involves clothing. The criteria for acceptable modesty and [[Indecent exposure|decency]] have relaxed continuously in much of the world since the nineteenth century, with [[Little black dress|shorter]], [[Form-fitting garment|form-fitting]], and more revealing clothing and [[swimsuit]]s, more for women than men. Most people wear clothes that they consider not to be unacceptably immodest for their religion, culture, generation, occasion, and the people present. Some wear clothes which they consider immodest, due to [[exhibitionism]], the desire to create an [[erotic]] impact, or for [[publicity]].

===Generally accepted Western norms===
Appropriate modesty depends on context and place. For example, in [[sex segregation|single-sex]] [[Change room|public changing rooms]], nudity is often acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/16/britons-bad-being-naked-victoria-coren Why are Britons so bad at being naked?] Sarah Ditum, The Guardian, United Kingdom (16 January 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lisboa 2012 - People - XXX (7672031984).jpg|thumb|The definition of modest clothing varies vastly between cultures. The photograph shows a girl in a  [[microskirt]] in Portugal.]]
In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much body exposure is acceptable in public.&lt;ref&gt;Salmansohn, Karen. "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-salmansohn/the_power_of_cleavage_b_70260.html The Power of Cleavage]". ''The Huffington Post'', October 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary Western society, the extent to which a woman may expose [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] depends on social, cultural and regional context. Women's [[swimsuit]]s and [[bikini]]s commonly may reveal the tops and sides of the breasts, or they may be topless as is common on the beaches of [[French Riviera]]. Displaying cleavage is considered permissible in many settings, and is even a sign of elegance and sophistication on many formal social occasions, but it may be considered inappropriate in settings such as workplaces, churches and schools. Showing the [[nipple]]s or [[areolae]] is almost always considered [[toplessness]] or partial [[nudity]]. However, in some circumstances partial breast exposure may be officially sanctioned in church as in 2014, newly elected Pope Francis drew world-wide commentary when he encouraged mothers to breastfeed in church if their babies were hungry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/12/pope-mothers-breastfeeding-children-sistine-chapel|title=Pope Francis encourages mothers to breastfeed - even in the Sistine Chapel|first=Lizzy|last=Davies|date=12 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In private homes, the standards of modesty apply selectively. For instance, nudity among close family members in the home can take place, especially in the [[bedroom]] and [[bathroom]], and wearing of undergarments only in the home is common.

In many cultures it is not acceptable to bare the [[buttocks]] in public; [[Mooning|deliberately doing so]] is sometimes intended as an insult. In [[Public place|public]], Western standards of decency expect people to cover their [[genitalia]], and women to cover their [[breast]]s. In the early twenty-first century, public [[breastfeeding]] has become increasingly acceptable, sometimes protected by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/health/breastfeeding-state-laws.aspx |title=Breastfeeding Laws |work=Breastfeeding State Laws |publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures, United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Barack Obama's health care bill from 2010 provides additional support to nursing mothers, requiring employers to provide a private and shielded space for employees to use in order to nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/04/09/breast.feeding.society/|title=Breastfeeding rooms hidden in health care law - CNN.com|last=CNN|first=By  Elizabeth Landau,|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s it has become more common for young and/or fashionable women in Western societies to wear clothing that bared the midriff, "short shorts," backless tops, sheer and other styles considered to be immodest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osisa.org/buwa/regional/fashion-feminists-how-fashion-and-dress-shape-women%E2%80%99s-identities|title=Fashion for Feminists: How fashion and dress shape women’s identities|author=Varyanne Sika|date=10 January 2014|work=Open Society Initiative of Southern Africa (OSISA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender differences===
[[File:Femmes-Amish.jpg|thumb|Modesty in dress is a relative cultural concept, even in the West, as seen above in the [[plain dress]] of [[Amish]] women on an American beach in 2007.]]
Men and women are subject to different standards of modesty in dress. While both men and women, in Western culture, are generally expected to keep their genitals covered at all times, women are also expected to keep their breasts covered. Some body parts are normally more covered by men than women—e.g., the [[midriff]] and the upper part of the back. Organizations such as the [http://www.tera.ca Topfree Equal Rights Association] advocate for gender equality regarding display of the body. In 1992 New York State's highest court accepted [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] arguments and struck down the provision in New York's ''Exposure of the Person'' statute that made it illegal for women to bare their chests where men were permitted to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I92_0160.htm|title=Santorelli &amp; Schloss v. State of New York|author=|date=7 July 1992|publisher=Cornell University Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional indigenous ==
Traditional indigenous cultures, such as some African and traditional Australian [[Indigenous Australians|aboriginal]] cultures, are more relaxed on issues of clothing, though how much clothing is expected varies greatly, from nothing for some women, to everything except the [[glans penis]] for men of some tribes. In some African cultures, body painting is considered to be body coverage, and is considered by many an attire.

Modesty doesn't have to be related to having more clothes especially in the case of natives tribes. Some feel exposed when seen in certain clothes even though normal attire is much more revealing. Having ear or lip stoppers is seen as modest with the opposite being true as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/308591733/The-dominant-idea-that-clothing-is-necessary-for-reasons-of-modesty-is-a-cultural-premise-It-s-an|title=The dominant idea that clothing is necessary for reasons of modesty is a cultural premise.

==Religious traditions==
[[File:Buddhist Monks - Angkor Wat - Cambodia.JPG|thumb|Modesty in dress for Buddhist Monks visiting the Hindu-Buddhist temple complex [[Angkor Wat]], Cambodia]]
{{See also|Religion and sexuality}}

Most world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's [[human sexuality|sexuality]] in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed [[moral code]]s covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc.  Besides other aspects of sexuality, these moral codes seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to [[sexual interest]] and to influence people's behaviour and practices which could arouse such interest, or which overstate a person's sexuality. These religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behavior, speech etc.

===Buddhism===
{{expand section|date=October 2013}}
Modesty in dress is important in Buddhism. The Sekhiya rules of Buddhist Monastic code, for example, provide guidelines on proper clothing as well as recommended ways of dressing for monks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.dhammadana.org/sangha/vinaya/227/75sk.htm The 75 sekhiyas] Buddhism Dhamma Dana (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I will wear the lower robe [upper robe] wrapped around (me): a training to be observed.|Code 1.2, Sekhiya Rule|&lt;ref name="Buddhist Monastic Code I"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc1/bmc1.ch10.html Buddhist Monastic Code I]
Chapter 10, Sekhiya Rules, Thanissaro Bhikkhu (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|I will not go [sit] with robes hitched up in inhabited areas: a training to be observed.|Code 9.10, Sekhiya Rule|&lt;ref name="Buddhist Monastic Code I"/&gt;}}

The 'robes hitched up' phrase above refers to lifting one's 1 or 2 piece cloth robe, thereby exposing either side or both sides of one's body to other human beings in an inhabited area. Such exhibitionism is not recommended to monks. Beyond monks, the Buddhist belief is that modesty has a purifying quality to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Thomas (2002), The History of Buddhist Thought, Dover Publications, {{ISBN|978-0486421049}}, pp 163, 207-208&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:Martin Luther Preaching to Faithful (1561).jpg|thumb|A painting of the Lutheran [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]] shows women wearing a [[Christian headcovering]].]]
[[File:Te_Deum_Elizarovo_Guslitsa_8484.jpg|thumb|Women seen in modest dress outside a [[Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church|Russian Orthodox Christian, Old-Rite]] church.]]

According to the New Testament, ({{Bibleverse|1 Peter|3:3-4|KJV}}) Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.

({{Bibleverse|1 Timothy|2:9|KJV}}) In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array.

Many Trinitarian Christians consider modesty extremely important,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.christianaction.org.za/articles_ca/2004-3-ModestyTheUndressingOfOurYouth.htm Modesty:  The Undressing of Our Youth], by Lenora Hammond.&lt;/ref&gt; though considerable differences of opinion exist about its requirements and purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.therebelution.com/modestysurvey/ The Modesty Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129185312/http://www.therebelution.com/modestysurvey/ |date=2009-01-29 }}: An anonymous discussion among Christians concerning various aspects of modesty.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anabaptists====

Many [[Anabaptist]] Christians, such as [[Amish]] groups and some [[Mennonite]] groups like [[Conservative Mennonites]], are known for their adherence to [[plain dress]], a modest fashion style. The [[Hutterite|Hutterites]] and the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]], both Christian intentional communities of the Anabaptist tradition, wear modest clothing (often plain dress), and the women wear [[Christian headcovering]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Catholicism====
[[File:Vatican-tourists-queuing-at-St-Peter-6598.jpg|thumb|A placard informs tourists about the minimum dress standards required to enter [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Vatican]]
Catholics are expected to dress modestly; it is recognised that the forms taken by modesty vary from one culture to another.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc.htm] Para. [http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a9.htm#II 2521-2524].&lt;/ref&gt; The wearing of a [[Christian headcovering]] at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] was for the first time mandated as a universal rule for the [[Latin Rite]] by the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)#Codification|Code of Canon Law of 1917]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jgray.org/codes/cic17lat.html |title=1917 Codex Iuris Canonici |work= Canon 1262, Section 2}} (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt; abrogated by the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2.HTM |title=Canon 6 §1 of the Code of Canon Law }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from that, there have never been any "official" guidelines issued by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. But from time to time the Church hierarchy, and some popes, have given opinions on various matters; although these guidelines are not binding, they are often followed.&lt;ref&gt;See all the following citations, which all expound at least partly upon such guidelines.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pope Pius XII]] stated that women should cover their upper arms and shoulders, that their skirts should cover at least as far as the knee, and the neckline should not reveal anything.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.theuniversityconcourse.com/article/1819.html Modesty and beauty - the lost connection] by Regina Schmiedicke&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Giuseppe Siri|Giuseppe Cardinal Siri of Genoa]] stated that [[trousers]] were unacceptable dress for [[women]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/athens/rhodes/3543/nodress.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+12:55:36 Notification Concerning Men's Dress Worn by Women] by Giuseppe Cardinal Siri (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many traditional Catholics have attempted to further expand on this latter standard.&lt;ref&gt;See G. K. Chesterton, [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=39813 ''What's Wrong with the World''], Part III, Chap. V, for an early attempt (1910); see also [http://gorpub.freeshell.org/cr.html#praise In Praise of the Skirt], for a more contemporary one (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Catholics have attempted to form cohesive theories of modesty. Sometimes this is from a sociological perspective,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; while at other times it takes a more systematic, [[Thomism|Thomistic]] approach, combined with the writings of the [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gorpub.freeshell.org/books.html#modesty The Modesty Handbook] (describing the nature of modesty from a Catholic perspective, based on St. Thomas Aquinas and the Church Fathers).&lt;/ref&gt;  Approaches arguing primarily from traditional practices and traditional authorities, such as the Saints, can also be found.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://sicutincaelo.org/b03_twsg.html Those Who Serve God Should Not Follow the Fashions] by Robert T. Hart (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1913, it became fashionable for dresses to be worn with a modest round or V-shaped neckline. In the [[German Empire]], for example, all [[Roman Catholic]] bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking the new fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, Alison. ''Victorian and Edwardian Fashion. A Photographic Survey''. Mineola, N.Y.: Dover Publications, 1981. Reprint of 1963 edition. {{ISBN|0-486-24205-6}}, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Legion of Decency]] has been active from 1933 in monitoring morally objectionable content in films. It has condemned a number of films including several on account of the clothing worn. For example, [[list of films condemned by the Legion of Decency|the Legion has condemned]] the display of [[cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] in ''[[The Outlaw]]'' (1941) and in ''[[The French Line]]'' (1954).

====Quakers====
[[Conservative Friends]] and [[Central Yearly Meeting of Friends|Holiness-Orthodox Friends]], two associations of Quaker Christians, wear [[plain dress]] as part of their [[testimony of simplicity]]. 

====Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
{{see also|Law of chastity}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) has issued official statements on modest dress for its members. Clothing such as "short shorts and short skirts, shirts that do not cover the stomach, and clothing that does not cover the shoulders or is low-cut in the front or the back"&lt;ref name="lds_modesty_guidelines"&gt;[http://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/dress-and-appearance "Dress and Appearance"], ''[[For the Strength of Youth]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; are discouraged. Men and women are also encouraged to avoid extremes in clothing or hairstyles. Rules on modesty also include women being asked to wear no more than one pair of earrings.&lt;ref name="lds_modesty_guidelines" /&gt; Women are generally expected to wear skirts or dresses for church services. Most LDS members do not wear sleeveless shirts or shorts that do not reach the knee.

The church-funded university, [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), requires students and tenants of BYU housing to sign an agreement to live according to these standards of modesty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://honorcode.byu.edu The Brigham Young University Honor Code], which includes "Dress and Grooming Standards," agreement to which is required for application.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===

}}
The premise and concepts of modesty have evolved under Hinduism. During Vedic times,{{sfn|Tarlo|1996|p=28–30}} both women and men wore at least two pieces of draped dress that was largely undifferentiated, voluntary and flexible. Stitched clothes such as skirts and bodices were also common in the Vedic period. However, modesty was not determined by the precepts of religion, but by local traditions, social codes, profession, circumstances and occasion. The multiple pieces of draped dress for women evolved into a single length of draped cloth among Indian Hindus, now called [[sari]];{{sfn|Tarlo|1996|p=28–30}} but remained two or more pieces in Southeast Asian Hindus. For men, the draped dress reduced to one piece now called by various names such as [[dhoti]], ''lungi'', ''pancha'', ''laacha'' and other names among Indian Hindus, and ''kamben'' among Balinese Hindu.

The Hindu belief, suggests [[Christopher Bayly]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Bayly|C. A. Bayly]], D.H.A. Kolff, ''Two Colonial Empires: Comparative Essays on the History of India and Indonesia in the Nineteenth Century'', Springer, {{ISBN|978-9024732746}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that modesty through appropriate dress has the energy to transmit spirit and substance in a social discourse, the dress serves as a means of expression or celebration, with some dressing elements such as saffron threads or white dress worn by men as moral, transformative and a means to identify and communicate one’s social role in a gathering, or one's state of life such as mourning in days or weeks after the passing away of a loved one.

The canons of modesty for Hindus in South Asia underwent significant changes with the arrival of Islam in the 12th century. The Islamic rulers imposed a dress code in public places for Hindu [[dhimmis]], per their Islamic mores of modesty.{{sfn|Tarlo|1996|p=28–30}} The ''sari'' worn by Hindu women extended to provide a veil, as well as a complete cover of her navel and legs. In the early 18th century, Tryambakayajvan—a court official in south central India—issued an edict called ''Stridharmapaddhati''. The ruling outlined required dress code for orthodox Hindus in that region.&lt;ref&gt;Lesile, J. (Editor) (1992), ''Roles and Rituals for Hindu Women'', Motilal Banarsidass Publications&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stridharmapaddhati'' laced social trends with Hindu religion to place new rules on modesty for women, but gave much freedom to men.

The concept of modesty evolved again during colonial times when the British administration required Indians to wear dresses to help identify and segregate the local native populations. Bernard Cohn,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Cohn (1987), ''An Anthropologist Among the Historians and Other Essays'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195618754}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ross, ''Clothing: A Global History'', Cambridge, {{ISBN|978-0-7456-3186-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; remark that dress during colonial era became part of a wider issue in India about respect, honor and modesty, with the dress code intentionally aimed by the administration to reflect the nature of relationship between the British ruler and the Indian ruled. The British colonial empire, encouraged and sometimes required Indians to dress in an 'oriental manner', to help define and enforce a sense of modesty, identify roles and a person's relative social status.{{sfn|Tarlo|1996|p=12–59}}&lt;ref&gt;see Bernard Cohn, "Cloth, Clothes and Colonialism: India in the 19th Century", and Susan Bean, "Gandhi and Khadi: The Fabric of Independence"; both in Weiner and Schneider (editors), ''Cloth and Human Experience'', Smithsonian Institution Press (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Among Indonesian Hindus, the accepted practice of toplessness among teenage Hindu girls changed during the Dutch colonial rule, with women now wearing a blouse or colorful cloth.

====Temples====
[[File:South Indian Temple Tamil1.jpg|thumb|Women dressed in ''sari'', heading into a South Indian Hindu Temple.]]
Inside most Hindu temples, there is an expectation of modesty rather than sexual allurement. Men and women typically wear traditional dress during religious ceremonies and rituals in a temple, with women wearing ''sari'' or regional Indian dress.&lt;ref&gt;Nye, M. (1995). ''A Place for Our Gods: The Construction of an Edinburgh Hindu Temple Community'' (Vol. 8). Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; In Indonesia and Cambodia, Hindu temple visitors are often requested to wrap their waist with traditional single piece cloth called ''kamben'', ''wastra'' or ''sarung'', with or without ''saput''.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein and Connor (1999), ''Staying Local in the Global Village: Bali in the Twentieth Century'', University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824821173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Current trends====
Hindus have diverse views on modesty, with significant regional and local variations. Among orthodox Hindu populations, sexually revealing dress or any sexual behavior in public or before strangers is considered immodest, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, the dress of deities and other symbolism in Hindu temples,&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, M. (1994). "Sexuality in the Indian subcontinent". ''Sexual and Marital Therapy'', 9(1), pp 57–69&lt;/ref&gt; the discussion of dress and eroticism in ancient Hindu literature,&lt;ref&gt;McConnachie, J. (2008), ''The Book of Love: The Story of the Kamasutra'', Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, R. (2000). "The erotics of the wet sari in Hindi films". South Asia: ''Journal of South Asian Studies'', 23(2), pp 143–160&lt;/ref&gt; and art works of Hinduism&lt;ref&gt;Ichaporia, N. (1983). "Tourism at Khajuraho an Indian enigma?" ''Annals of Tourism Research'', 10(1), 75–92&lt;/ref&gt; can be explicit, celebrating eroticism and human sexuality.

In general, a disregard of modesty can be confusing or distressing, in particular to traditional Hindu women. Even in health care context, some Hindu women may express reluctance to undress for examination. If undressing is necessary, the patient may prefer to be treated by a doctor or nurse of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/publications/cr_diversity/hinduism.pdf Culture and Religion Information Sheet: Hinduism] Government of Western Australia (July 2012), page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
[[File:Kalkan market 2.JPG|thumb|A headscarf]]
{{See also|Awrah|List of types of sartorial hijab}}
Islam has strongly emphasized the concept of decency and modesty. In many authentic [[hadith]]s, it has been quoted that "modesty is a part of faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://40hadithnawawi.com/index.php/the-hadiths/hadith-20 | title=Hadith 20 :: Modesty is from Faith | publisher=40hadithnawawi.com | accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modesty is verily required in the interaction between members of the opposite sex and in some case between the members of same sex also. Dress code is part of that overall teaching.

====Women====

"And tell the believing women to cast down their glances and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess, or those male attendants having no physical desire, or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women." -Quran 24:31.

“O Prophet! Say to your wives, your daughters, and the women of the believers that: they should let down upon themselves their jalabib.” -Quran 33:59. Jalabib is an Arabic word meaning "loose outer garment".

In some Muslim societies, women wear the [[niqab]], a veil that covers the whole face except the eyes, or the full [[burqa]], a full-body covering garment that occasionally does cover the eyes. Wearing these garments is common in some, but not all, countries with a predominantly Muslim population.

[[File:Kufihat.jpg|thumb|A taqiyah cap]]
Though by some scholars these expressions of modesty are interpreted as mandatory, most countries do not enforce modesty by law. However, a few countries, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], Afghanistan and Iran, enforce specified standards of dress for women.

====Men====

"Tell the believing men to cast down their glances and guard their private parts. That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is [well] acquainted with what they do." -Quran 24:30

Most scholars agree that men are required to cover everything from the navel to the knees; some men choose also to wear the traditional Islamic cap [[Taqiyah (cap)|(taqiyah)]], similar to but larger than the Jewish [[yarmulke]] or [[kippah]]. The taqiyah may vary in shape, size and color, with differences according to tradition, region, and personal taste.

===Judaism===
Modesty in [[Judaism]], called [[Tzniut]] ({{lang-he-n|צניעות}}), is important beyond aspects of clothing. It extends to behaviour in public and in private, and depends on the context.

====Women====
[[File:Women praying in the Western Wall tunnels by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Three styles of hair covering common among married Observant Jewish women. From right to left: snood, fall, and hat.]]

[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Ultra-Orthodox Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] Jewish women usually wear skirts to their knees, with blouses covering the collarbone and sleeves coming to or covering elbows.&lt;ref name="Patheos"&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Modesty-Not-Just-for-Women?offset=0&amp;max=1 "Modesty: Not Only A Woman's Burden"], ''[[Patheos]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[See-through clothing|See-through materials]] may not be used and clothes are expected not to be [[Form-fitting garment|tight-fitting]], provocative, loud in color, or display texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modestworld.com/laws.html The Laws of Jewish Modesty]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510043220/http://www.modestworld.com/laws.html |date=May 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These rules are relaxed to allow for color and text in less strict communities. Some modern Orthodox communities allow the collarbone to be shown (so long as cleavage is amply covered), and sleeves not to reach the elbow. There are many different opinions on these issues. Some communities apply these standards to girls as young as three. Less strict [[Conservative Judaism]] recommends modest dress, but this is not broadly observed. Less restrictive branches of Judaism tend to adopt the fashions of the society in which they live.

It is the custom for an observant married [[Orthodox Jewish]] woman to cover her hair in public, and sometimes at home. The hair covering may be a scarf, hat, [[Snood (headgear)|snood]] called a [[Tichel]], or a [[Wig (hair)|wig]] called a [[Sheitel]].

Women who do not follow all the regulations in everyday life, often do so during religious observances in a [[synagogue]] or elsewhere.

====Men====
[[File:Praying at Belzer Rebbe's grave.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Jewish man praying at a grave, Israel]]
Standards of modesty also apply to men.  While some men will wear shorts and short-sleeve shirts, however strictly orthodox men will not. More modern Orthodox Jewish Men will be more lax in their dress when surrounded by other men (if it is not in a religious environment). Modesty for men most often translates to covering the torso and legs with loose clothing. Different groups of Orthodox Jews have different dress norms. But most have men dress in black suits, white dress shirts, and a Black hat (along with religious clothing).

===Cross-cultural and non-religious===

Some individuals adopt modesty standards of other groups or standards of previous generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadianundercover.wordpress.com/about/|title=Canadian Undercover: Bio|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example includes the [[Noahidism|Noahides]] who follow Jewish laws but are not themselves Jewish.

==In the arts==
[[File:Cupidon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cupidon (1875)|Cupidon]] (French for [[Cupid]]), painting by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], 1875; the tip of the boy god's right wing covers his genitals.]]
[[File:Modesty,_marble,_1833,_Jean-Louis_Jaley_(3).jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|''Modesty'', marble statue of a partly-draped woman by [[Jean-Louis Jaley]], 1875.]]
Standards of modesty in art have varied at different times and in different places. [[depictions of nudity|Nudity and various types of behavior were sometimes depicted]], sometime not. In many cases where society did not allow nudity or immodest dress, nudity was accepted in art. Where nudity in art was not acceptable, full nudity was not displayed; otherwise nude subjects had their intimate parts hidden by apparently accidental draped fabric, flowers, other people, a [[fig leaf]], etc. In films, very brief nudity was accepted. Some nude artworks had fig leaves added when standards became less permissive.

In a given society, the criteria varied according to the circumstances; for example artworks on public display were more restrained than those for private display to adults.

Nudity in art was sometimes suggested without actual depiction by:
* something seemingly by chance covering the parts of the body which should modestly be covered
*[[nudity in film|in film]]:
** showing a supposedly nude person from the waist or shoulders up
** maneuvering (turning, having objects in front) and [[Film editing|editing]] in such a way that no genitals are seen
** showing nudity from a distance, or from the back only, although other characters are nearby and/or would also see frontal nudity
** showing nudity very briefly

In [[cartoon]]s, even in cases where the genital area is not covered with clothing, genitals are often simply not drawn, as is the case in [[Family Guy]] and other [[animated sitcom]]s. In the film ''[[Barnyard (film)|Barnyard]]'', showing [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] cattle of both sexes walking on two legs, instead of either showing [[Bull#Reproductive anatomy|genitals of male cattle]] or not showing them, the concept of a "male cow" was used, with an [[udder]]. In ''[[Underdog (film)|Underdog]]'' a partly animated anthropomorphized dog is shown with penis when a real dog is filmed, and without penis in the animated parts.

Paintings are sometimes changed because of changed modesty standards, and later sometimes changed back. During the [[Counter-Reformation]] there was a "fig-leaf campaign" aiming to cover all representations of human genitals in paintings and sculptures that started with Michelangelo's works. Works covered in this way include the marble statue of ''[[Cristo della Minerva]]'' (church of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]], Rome) which was covered by added drapery, as it remains today, and the statue of the naked child Jesus in ''[[Madonna of Bruges]]'' (The [[Church of Our Lady, Bruges|Church of Our Lady]] in [[Bruges]], Belgium) remained covered for several decades. Also, the plaster copy of the David in the [[Cast Courts (Victoria and Albert Museum)]] in London, has a fig leaf in a box at the back of the statue. It was there to be placed over the statue's genitals so that they would not upset visiting female royalty. The statue of Achilles at [[Hyde Park Corner]] now has an incongruous figleaf permanently attached, after it was stolen several times. 
{{See also|Expulsion from the Garden of Eden}}

Many fairytales and other related media feature women from or ethnic origin from [[Western Europe]] and [[Northern Europe]] to be demure due to their typically soft features. Famous examples include [[Snow White]], [[Cinderella]], [[Sleeping Beauty]], [[Beauty and the Beast]], [[Little Red Riding Hood]], [[Wendy Darling]] from [[Peter Pan]], [[Maid Marian]] from [[Robin Hood]], [[Christine Daaé]] from [[The Phantom of the Opera]], [[Ophelia]] from [[Hamlet]], and [[Dorothy Gale]] from [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]].

'''Moral example''' is trust in the [[moral core]] of another, a [[role model]].  It was cited by [[Confucius]], [[Muhammad]], [[Mohandas Gandhi]] and other important philosophers and theologians as the prime duty of a ruler - including the head of a family or the owner of a business.  

It is the case that since the exact circumstances and decisions of the lives of such moral examples cannot be reproduced or repeated, followers are often reduced to following their [[etiquette]] and customs, e.g. in [[ancestor worship]].

[[Storytelling]] can take a central role in any culture built on moral example, particularly when the provider of the moral example does not refer to an explicit ethical theory or philosophy as the basis for his behavior. A complex culture built on such stories can fall prey to a clique of experts who interpret them for the lay public.  This has led in the past to institutions that sort through anecdotes to decide which of them are true, e.g. [[isnad]] in [[Islam]] by which the [[hadith]] are validated.

[[Christian]]s still see [[Jesus]] as the ultimate [[divine]] example- in [[Epistle to the Hebrews]]: "looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith" (12:2).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="955">'''Moral perception''' is a term used in [[ethics]] to denote the discernment of the morally salient qualities in particular situations. Moral [[perception]]s are argued to be necessary to [[moral reasoning]] (see [[practical reason]]), the deliberation of what is the right thing to do. Moral perception is variously conceptualized by [[Aristotle]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Martha C. Nussbaum]]. [[Lawrence Blum]] (1994) distinguishes moral perception from moral judgment. Whereas a person's judgment about what the moral course of action would be is the result of a conscious deliberation, the basis for that process is the perception of aspects of one's situation, which is different for each person. Moral perceptions are also particular in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Lawrence. 1994. Moral Perception and Particularity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nazi eugenics''' ({{lang-de|Nationalsozialistische Rassenhygiene}}, "National Socialist racial hygiene") were [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Nazism and race|racially based]] social policies that placed the biological improvement of the [[Aryan race]] or Germanic "''[[Übermensch]]en''" [[master race]] through [[eugenics]] at the center of Nazi ideology.&lt;ref name="Longerich2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Longerich|title=Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews|date=15 April 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280436-5|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Germany]], eugenics were mostly known under the synonymous term '''racial hygiene'''. Following the [[Second World War]], both terms effectively vanished and were replaced by ''Humangenetik'' ([[human genetics]]).

Eugenics research in Germany before and during the Nazi period was similar to that in the [[Eugenics in the United States|United States]] (particularly California), by which it had been partly inspired. However, its prominence rose sharply under [[Adolf Hitler]]'s leadership when wealthy Nazi supporters started heavily investing in it. The programs were subsequently shaped to complement [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial policies]].&lt;ref name="murphy"/&gt;

Those humans targeted for destruction under Nazi eugenics policies were largely living in private and state-operated institutions, identified as "[[life unworthy of life]]" ({{lang-de|Lebensunwertes Leben}}), including prisoners, [[Degeneration|"degenerates"]], [[Gleichschaltung|dissidents]], people with congenital cognitive and physical disabilities (including people who were "feebleminded", epileptic, schizophrenic, manic-depressive, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, deaf, blind) ({{lang-de| erbkranken}}), [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|homosexual]], idle, insane, and the weak, for elimination from the chain of [[heredity]]. More than 400,000 people were [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilized against their will]], while more than 70,000 were killed under [[Aktion T4|Action T4]], a [[euthanasia]] program.&lt;ref name="USHMM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digitalassets.ushmm.org/photoarchives/detail.aspx?id=10049&amp;search=EUTHANASIA+%28PATIENTS%2FVICTIMS%29&amp;index=25 | title=Close-up of Richard Jenne, the last child killed by the head nurse at the Kaufbeuren-Irsee euthanasia facility. | publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum | accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler: A Profile in Power'', Chapter VI, first section (London, 1991, rev. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, S. &amp; D.

==Origins in the U.S. eugenics movement==
{{See also|Eugenics in the United States}}

The early German eugenics movement was led by [[Wilhelm Schallmayer]] and [[Alfred Ploetz]].&lt;ref name="weiss1987"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ucpress.edu/op.php?isbn=9780520058231  |title=Race Hygiene and National Efficiency: The Eugenics of Wilhelm Schallmayer  |last=Weiss |first=Sheila |date=1987 |website= |publisher=University of California Press |access-date= |quote=Wilhelm Schallmayer (1857-1919) who, along with Alfred Ploetz (1860-1940), founded German eugenics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="friedlander2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedlander |first=Henry |date=2000 |title=The Origins of Nazi Genocide: From Euthanasia to the Final Solution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKjqCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press |page=13 |isbn=978-0807846759 |author-link= | quote=Although the German eugenics movement, led until the Weimar years by Alfred Ploetz and Wilhelm Schallmayer, did not differ radically from the American movement, it was more centralized. Unlike in the United States, where federalism and political heterogeneity encouraged diversity even with a single movement, in Germany one society, the German Society for Race Hygiene (''Deutsche Gesellschaft fue Rassenhygiene''), eventually represented all eugenicists, while one journal, the ''Archiv fur Rassen- und Gsellschafts Biologie'', founded by Ploetz in 1904, remained the primary scientific publication of German Eugenics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry Friedlander]] wrote that although the German and American eugenics movements were similar, the German movement was more centralized and did not contain as many diverse ideas as the American movement.&lt;ref name="friedlander2000"/&gt;  Unlike the American movement, one publication and one society, the [[German Society for Racial Hygiene]], represented all eugenicists.&lt;ref name="friedlander2000"/&gt;

[[Edwin Black]] wrote that after the eugenics movement was well established in the United States, it was spread to Germany. California eugenicists began producing literature promoting eugenics and sterilization and sending it overseas to German scientists and medical professionals.&lt;ref name="black2003"&gt;{{cite web| author=Edwin Black | title=Eugenics and the Nazis -- the California connection | publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle'' | url= http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Eugenics-and-the-Nazis-the-California-2549771.php | date=November 9, 2003 | access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1933, California had subjected more people to forceful sterilization than all other U.S. states combined. The forced sterilization program engineered by the Nazis was partly inspired by California's.&lt;ref name="murphy"&gt;Murphy &amp; Lappé, 1994: [https://books.google.com/books?id=1lvbUy441m0C&amp;pg=PA18 p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology (KWIA), an organization which concentrated on physical and social anthropology as well as human genetics, was founded in Berlin with significant financial support from the American philanthropic group, the Rockefeller Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen E. Schafft, ''From Racism to Genocide: Anthropology in the Third Reich'' (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2004), pp. 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt; German professor of medicine, anthropology and eugenics [[Eugen Fischer]] was the director of this organization, a man whose work helped provide the scientific basis for the Nazis' eugenics policies.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Wistrich, ''Who's Who In Nazi Germany'' (New York: Routledge, 2001), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1933, Adolf Hitler appointed Fischer rector of Frederick William University of Berlin, now [[Humboldt University]]. See: [http://www.historische-kommission-muenchen-editionen.de/rektoratsreden/anzeige/index.php?type=rektor&amp;id=93753244 "Rektoratsreden im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert – Online-Bibliographie"], der ehemalige Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] even funded some of the research conducted by [[Josef Mengele]] before he went to [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref name="black2003"/&gt;

Upon returning from Germany in 1934, where more than 5,000 people per month were being forcibly sterilized, the California eugenics leader [[Charles Goethe|C. M. Goethe]] bragged to a colleague:

{{blockquote|You will be interested to know that your work has played a powerful part in shaping the opinions of the group of intellectuals who are behind [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in this epoch-making program. Everywhere I sensed that their opinions have been tremendously stimulated by American thought... I want you, my dear friend, to carry this thought with you for the rest of your life, that you have really jolted into action a great government of 60 million people.&lt;ref name="black2003"/&gt;}}

Eugenics researcher [[Harry Laughlin|Harry H. Laughlin]] often bragged that his Model Eugenic Sterilization laws had been implemented in the [[Nuremberg Laws|1935 Nuremberg racial hygiene laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Jackson, John P. &amp; Weidman, Nadine M.|title=Race, racism, and science: social impact and interaction|year=2005|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8135-3736-8|page=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-crlAYsZ-MC&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Laughlin was invited to an award ceremony at [[Heidelberg University]] in Germany (scheduled on the anniversary of Hitler's 1934 purge of Jews from the Heidelberg faculty), to receive an honorary doctorate for his work on the "science of racial cleansing". Due to financial limitations, Laughlin was unable to attend the ceremony and had to pick it up from the Rockefeller Institute. Afterwards, he proudly shared the award with his colleagues, remarking that he felt that it symbolized the "common understanding of German and American scientists of the nature of eugenics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Three Generations, No Imbeciles: Eugenics, the Supreme Court, and "Buck v. Bell" | publisher=[[JHU Press]] | author=Lombardo, Paul A. | authorlink=Paul A. Lombardo| year=2008 | pages=211–213 | isbn=9780801890109 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_dobTNiDNgC&amp;pg=PA211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hitler's views on eugenics==
[[File:Aktion_brand.jpg|thumb|Hitler's order for Action T4]]
[[Adolf Hitler]] read about [[racial hygiene]] during his imprisonment in [[Landsberg Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Jonathan C.|title=The Routledge History of the Holocaust|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-77956-2|pages=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5v2U8AAv1EcC&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler believed the nation had become weak, corrupted by [[dysgenics]], the infusion of degenerate elements into its bloodstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|authorlink=Richard J. Evans|title=The Third Reich in Power|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Press|isbn=978-1-59420-074-8|pages=429|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3j-Aq1hAgJEC&amp;lpg=PT429&amp;pg=PT429|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racialism and idea of competition, termed [[social Darwinism]] in 1944, were discussed by European scientists and also in the Vienna press during the 1920s. Where Hitler picked up the ideas is uncertain. The theory of evolution had been generally accepted in Germany at the time, but this sort of extremism was rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Mathúna | first1 = Dónal P | year = 2006 | title = Human dignity in the Nazi era: implications for contemporary bioethics | journal = [[BMC Medical Ethics]] | volume =  7| issue = | pages = E2| pmc=1484488 | pmid=16536874 | doi=10.1186/1472-6939-7-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Zweites Buch|''Second Book'']], which was unpublished during the Nazi era, Hitler praised Sparta, (using ideas perhaps borrowed from [[Ernst Haeckel]]),&lt;ref&gt;In 1876 Haeckel had discussed the selective [[infanticide]] policy of the Greek city of ancient [[Sparta]].{{cite web |first= |last= |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |author=Haeckel, Ernst |coauthors= |title=The History of Creation, vol. I |url=http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/Radical%20Ecology.htm#EUGENICS%20JUSTIFIED%20BY%20NATURE |format= |work= |publisher=New York: D. Appleton |id= |page=170 |year=1876 |accessdate= |quote=Among the Spartans all newly born children were subject to a careful examination or selection. All those that were weak, sickly, or affected with any bodily infirmity, were killed. Only the perfectly healthy and strong children were allowed to live, and they alone afterwards propagated the race.}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that he considered Sparta to be the first "[[Völkisch]] State". He endorsed what he perceived to be an early [[eugenics]] treatment of deformed children:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sparta must be regarded as the first Völkisch State. The exposure of the sick, weak, deformed children, in short, their destruction, was more decent and in truth a thousand times more humane than the wretched insanity of our day which preserves the most pathological subject, and indeed at any price, and yet takes the life of a hundred thousand healthy children in consequence of [[birth control]] or through [[abortion]]s, in order subsequently to breed a race of degenerates burdened with illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hitler, Adolf |title=[[Hitler's Secret Book]] |year=1961 |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |isbn=0-394-62003-8 |oclc=9830111 |pages=17–18 | quote= |authorlink=Adolf Hitler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hawkins, Mike |title=Social Darwinism in European and American Thought, 1860-1945: nature as model and nature as threat |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-57434-X |oclc=34705047 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SszNCxSKmgkC&amp;pg=PA276 | page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Bus Hartheim Foto Niedernhart Prozess.jpg|thumb|Collection bus for killing patients]]
In organizing their eugenics program the Nazis were inspired by the United States' programs of [[forced sterilization]], especially on the eugenics laws that had been enacted in [[California]].&lt;ref name="black2003"/&gt;

The [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]], enacted on July 14, 1933, allowed the compulsory sterilisation of any citizen who according to the opinion of a "Genetic Health Court" suffered from a list of alleged genetic disorders and required [[physician]]s to register every case of hereditary illness known to them, except in women over 45 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facinghistorycampus.org/campus/rm.nsf/0/81C67A69F8081A5885257037005E9C6A facinghistorycampus.org – The Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207110601/http://www.facinghistorycampus.org/campus/rm.nsf/0/81C67A69F8081A5885257037005E9C6A |date=2009-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians could be fined for failing to comply.

In 1934, the first year of the Law's operation, nearly 4,000 persons appealed against the decisions of sterilization authorities. A total of 3,559 of the appeals failed. By the end of the Nazi regime, over 200 [[Hereditary Health Court]]s ({{lang|de|Erbgesundheitsgerichte}}) were created, and under their rulings over 400,000 persons were sterilized against their will.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Proctor, ''Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1988): 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi eugenics institutions===
[[File:Hadamar 012.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Gas chamber in Hadamar]]
The [[Hadamar Clinic]] was a [[mental hospital]] in the German town of [[Hadamar]] used by the Nazi-controlled German government as the site of [[Action T4]]. The [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]] was founded in 1927. [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre]] was also part of the euthanasia programme where the Nazis killed individuals they deemed disabled. The first method used involved transporting patients by buses in which the engine exhaust gases were passed into the interior of the buses, and so killed the passengers. [[Gas chamber]]s were developed later and used pure [[carbon monoxide]] gas to kill the patients.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
In its early years, and during the Nazi era, the Clinic was strongly associated with theories of eugenics and racial hygiene advocated by its leading theorists [[Fritz Lenz]] and [[Eugen Fischer]], and by its director [[Otmar von Verschuer]]. Under Fischer, the sterilization of so-called [[Rhineland Bastard]]s was undertaken. [[Grafeneck Castle]] was one of Nazi Germany's killing centers, and today it is a memorial place dedicated to the victims of the Action T4.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Memorialization_in_Germany_since_1945.html?hl=de&amp;id=1znCPwAACAAJ Knittel, S. "Remembering Euthanasia: Grafeneck in the Past, Present, and Future." B. Niven &amp; C. Paver &amp;#91;eds&amp;#93;.  Memorialization in Germany since 1945].  New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2010: 124-133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H13374, Philipp Bouhler.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Philipp Bouhler]], head of the T4 programme]]
The Law for Simplification of the Health System of July 1934 created Information Centers for Genetic and Racial Hygiene, as well as Health Offices. The law also described procedures for 'denunciation' and 'evaluation' of persons, who were then sent to a [[Genetic Health Court]] where sterilization was decided.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U-GhQrKj9vQC The Nazi census: identification and control in the Third Reich], By Götz Aly, Karl Heinz Roth, Edwin Black, Assenka Oksiloff, 2004, Temple University Press, p104&lt;/ref&gt;

Information to determine who was considered 'genetically sick' was gathered from routine information supplied by people to doctor's offices and welfare departments. Standardized questionnaires had been designed by Nazi officials with the help of [[Dehomag]] (a subsidiary of [[IBM]] in the 1930s), so that the information could be encoded easily onto [[Hollerith]] punch cards for fast sorting and counting.&lt;ref name="black1"&gt;See [[IBM and the Holocaust]] by [[Edwin Black]], 2001, Crown / Random House, pg 93-96 and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hamburg, doctors gave information into a Central Health Passport Archive (circa 1934), under something called the 'Health-Related Total Observation of Life'. This file was to contain reports from doctors, but also courts, insurance companies, sports clubs, the Hitler Youth, the military, the labor service, colleges, etc. Any institution that gave information would get information back in return. In 1940, the Reich Interior Ministry tried to impose a Hamburg-style system on the whole Reich.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U-GhQrKj9vQC The Nazi census: identification and control in the Third Reich], By Götz Aly, Karl Heinz Roth, Edwin Black, Assenka Oksiloff, 2004, Temple University Press, p104-108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi eugenics policies regarding marriage===
After the Nazis passed the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935, it became compulsory for both marriage partners to be tested for [[hereditary diseases]] in order to preserve the perceived racial purity of the Aryan race. Everyone was encouraged to carefully evaluate his or her prospective marriage partner eugenically during courtship. Members of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] were cautioned to carefully interview prospective marriage partners to make sure they had no family history of hereditary disease or insanity, but to do this carefully so as not to hurt the feelings of the prospective [[fiancee]] and, if it became necessary to reject her for eugenic reasons, to do it tactfully and not cause her any offense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Padfield|Padfield, Peter]] ''Himmler'' New York:1990--Henry Holt&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21185">In [[economics]], an '''ordinal utility''' function is a function representing the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] of an agent on an [[ordinal scale]]. The ordinal [[utility theory]] claims that it is only meaningful to ask which option is better than the other, but it is meaningless to ask ''how much'' better it is or how good it is. All of the theory of [[consumer choice|consumer decision-making]] under conditions of [[certainty]] can be, and typically is, expressed in terms of ordinal utility.

For example, suppose George tells us that "I prefer A to B and B to C". George's preferences can be represented by a function ''u'' such that:
:&lt;math&gt;u(A)=9, u(B)=8, u(C)=1&lt;/math&gt;
But the only meaningful message of this function is the order &lt;math&gt;u(A)&gt;u(B)&gt;u(C)&lt;/math&gt;; the actual numbers are meaningless. Hence, George's preferences can also be represented by the following function ''v'':
:&lt;math&gt;v(A)=9, v(B)=2, v(C)=1&lt;/math&gt;
The functions ''u'' and ''v'' are ordinally equivalent – they represent George's preferences equally well.

Ordinal utility contrasts with [[cardinal utility]] theory: the latter assumes that the differences between preferences are also important. In ''u'' the difference between A and B is much smaller than between B and C, while in ''v'' the opposite is true. Hence, ''u'' and ''v'' are ''not'' cardinally equivalent.

The ordinal utility concept was first introduced by [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pareto|first=Vilfredo|title=Manuale di economia politica, con una introduzione alla scienza sociale|journal=Societa Editrice Libraria|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notation ==
Suppose the set of all states of the world is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and an agent has a preference relation on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. It is common to mark the weak preference relation by &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;A \preceq B&lt;/math&gt; reads "the agent wants B at least as much as A".

The symbol &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is used as a shorthand to the indifference relation: &lt;math&gt;A\sim B \iff (A\preceq B \land B\preceq A)&lt;/math&gt;, which reads "The agent is indifferent between B and A".

The symbol &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; is used as a shorthand to the strong preference relation: &lt;math&gt;A\prec B \iff (A\preceq B \land  B\not\preceq A)&lt;/math&gt;, which reads "The agent strictly prefers B to A".

A function &lt;math&gt;u: X \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is said to ''represent'' the relation &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; if:
:&lt;math&gt;A \preceq B \iff u(A) \leq u(B)&lt;/math&gt;

== Related concepts ==
=== Indifference curve mappings ===
{{Main|indifference curve}}
Instead of defining a numeric function, an agent's preference relation can be represented graphically by indifference curves. This is especially useful when there are two kinds of goods, ''x'' and ''y''. Then, each indifference curve shows a set of points &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; such that, if &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_2,y_2)&lt;/math&gt; are on the same curve, then &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1) \sim (x_2,y_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

An example indifference curve is shown below:

[[File:Simple-indifference-curves.svg|200px|indifference map]]

Each indifference curve is a set of points, each representing a combination of quantities of two goods or services, all of which combinations the consumer is equally satisfied with. The further a curve is from the origin, the greater is the level of utility.

The slope of the curve (the negative of the [[marginal rate of substitution]] of X for Y) at any point shows the rate at which the individual is willing to trade off good X against good Y maintaining the same level of utility. The curve is convex to the origin as shown assuming the consumer has a diminishing marginal rate of substitution. It can be shown that consumer analysis with indifference curves (an ordinal approach) gives the same results as that based on [[cardinal utility]] theory — i.e., consumers will consume at the point where the marginal rate of substitution between any two goods equals the ratio of the prices of those goods (the equi-marginal principle).

=== Revealed preference ===

[[Revealed preference theory]] addresses the problem of how to observe ordinal preference relations in the real world. The challenge of revealed preference theory lies in part in determining what goods bundles were foregone, on the basis of them being less liked, when individuals are observed choosing particular bundles of goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

== Necessary conditions for existence of ordinal utility function ==
Some conditions on &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; are necessary to guarantee the existence of a representing function:

* [[Transitive relation|Transitivity]]: if &lt;math&gt;A \preceq B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \preceq C&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;A \preceq C&lt;/math&gt;. 
* Completeness:   for all bundles &lt;math&gt;A,B\in X&lt;/math&gt;: either &lt;math&gt;A\preceq B&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B\preceq A&lt;/math&gt; or both.
** Completeness also implies reflexivity: for every &lt;math&gt;A\in X&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;A \preceq A&lt;/math&gt;.

When these conditions are met and the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is finite, it is easy to create a function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; which represents &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; by just assigning an appropriate number to each element of  &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, as exemplified in the opening paragraph. The same is true when X is [[countably infinite]]. Moreover, it is possible to inductively construct a representing utility function whose values are in the range &lt;math&gt;(-1,1)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Rubinstein&gt;Ariel Rubinstein, Lecture Notes in Microeconomic Theory, [http://press.princeton.edu/rubinstein/lecture2.pdf Lecture 2 – Utility]&lt;/ref&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is infinite, these conditions are insufficient. For example, [[lexicographic preferences]] are transitive and complete, but they cannot be represented by any utility function.&lt;ref name=Rubinstein/&gt; The additional condition required is [[#Continuity|continuity]].

== Continuity ==
A preference relation is called ''continuous'' if, whenever B is preferred to A, small deviations from B or A will not reverse the ordering between them. Formally, a preference relation on a set X is called continuous if it satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions:

# For every &lt;math&gt;A\in X&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\{(A,B)|A\preceq B\}&lt;/math&gt; is [[topologically closed]] in &lt;math&gt;X\times X&lt;/math&gt; with the [[product topology]] (this definition requires &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to be a [[topological space]]).
# For every sequence &lt;math&gt;(A_i,B_i)&lt;/math&gt;, if for all ''i'' &lt;math&gt;A_i\preceq B_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_i \to A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_i \to B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A\preceq B&lt;/math&gt;.
# For every &lt;math&gt;A,B\in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A\prec B&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a ball around &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and a ball around &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; such that, for every &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the ball around &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in the ball around &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a\prec b&lt;/math&gt; (this definition requires &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to be a [[metric space]]).

If a preference relation is represented by a continuous utility function, then it is clearly continuous. By the theorems of [[Debreu theorems|Debreu (1954)]], the opposite is also true: 
::Every continuous complete preference relation can be represented by a continuous ordinal utility function.

Note that the [[lexicographic preferences]] are not continuous. For example, &lt;math&gt;(5,0)\prec (5,1)&lt;/math&gt;, but in every ball around (5,1) there are points with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;5&lt;/math&gt; and these points are inferior to &lt;math&gt;(5,0)&lt;/math&gt;. This is in accordance with the fact, stated above, that these preferences cannot be represented by a utility function.

== Uniqueness ==
For every utility function ''v'', there is a unique preference relation represented by ''v''. However, the opposite is not true: a preference relation may be represented by many different utility functions. The same preferences could be expressed as ''any'' utility function that is a monotonically increasing transformation of ''v''. E.g., if

:&lt;math&gt;v(A) \equiv f(v(A))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is ''any'' monotonically increasing function, then the functions ''v'' and ''v'' give rise to identical indifference curve mappings.

This equivalence is succinctly described in the following way:
::An ordinal utility function is ''unique up to increasing monotone transformation''.

In contrast, a [[cardinal utility]] function is only unique up to increasing [[affine transformation]]. Every affine transformation is monotone; hence, if two functions are cardinally equivalent they are also ordinally equivalent, but not vice versa.

== Monotonicity ==
Suppose, from now on, that the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all non-negative real two-dimensional vectors. So an element of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a pair &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; that represents the amounts consumed from two products, e.g., apples and bananas.

Then under certain circumstances a preference relation &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; is represented by a utility function &lt;math&gt;v(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose the preference relation is ''monotonically increasing'', which means that "more is always better":
:&lt;math&gt;x&lt;x' \implies (x,y)\prec(x',y)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y&lt;y' \implies (x,y')\prec(x,y')&lt;/math&gt;

Then, both partial derivatives, if they exist, of ''v'' are positive. In short: 
::''If a utility function represents a monotonically increasing preference relation, then the utility function is monotonically increasing.''

== Marginal rate of substitution ==
Suppose a person has a bundle &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0)&lt;/math&gt; and claims that he is indifferent between this bundle and the bundle &lt;math&gt;(x_0-\lambda\cdot\delta,y_0+\delta)&lt;/math&gt;. This means that he is willing to give &lt;math&gt;\lambda\cdot\delta&lt;/math&gt; units of x to get &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; units of y. If this ratio is kept as &lt;math&gt;\delta\to 0&lt;/math&gt;, we say that &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[marginal rate of substitution]] (MRS)'' between ''x'' and ''y'' at the point &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=KeeneyRaiffa1993&gt;{{Cite book  |last1=Keeney |first1=Ralph L. |last2=Raiffa |first2=Howard |title=Decisions with Multiple Objectives |year=1993 |isbn=0-521-44185-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}

This definition of the MRS is based only on the ordinal preference relation – it does not depend on a numeric utility function. If the preference relation is represented by a utility function and the function is differentiable, then the MRS can be calculated from the derivatives of that function:
:&lt;math&gt;MRS = \frac{v'_x}{v'_y}.&lt;/math&gt;
For example, if the preference relation is represented by &lt;math&gt;v(x,y)=x^a\cdot y^b&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;MRS = \frac{a\cdot x^{a-1}\cdot y^b}{b\cdot y^{b-1}\cdot x^a}=\frac{ay}{bx}&lt;/math&gt;. The MRS is the same for the function &lt;math&gt;v(x,y)=a\cdot \log{x} + b\cdot \log{y}&lt;/math&gt;. This is not a coincidence as these two functions represent the same preference relation – each one is an increasing monotone transformation of the other.

In general, the MRS may be different at different points &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, it is possible that at &lt;math&gt;(9,1)&lt;/math&gt; the MRS is low because the person has a lot of ''x'' and only one ''y'', but at &lt;math&gt;(9,9)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(1,1)&lt;/math&gt; the MRS is higher. Some special cases are described below.

== Linearity ==
When the MRS of a certain preference relation does not depend on the bundle, i.e., the MRS is the same for all &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0)&lt;/math&gt;, the indifference curves are linear and of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;x+\lambda y = \text{const},&lt;/math&gt;
and the preference relation can be represented by a linear function:
:&lt;math&gt;v(x,y)=x+\lambda y.&lt;/math&gt;
(Of course, the same relation can be represented by many other non-linear functions, such as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x+\lambda y}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(x+\lambda y)^2&lt;/math&gt;, but the linear function is simplest.)&lt;ref name=KeeneyRaiffa1993/&gt;{{rp|85}}

== Quasilinearity ==
When the MRS depends on &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; but not on &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, the preference relation can be represented by a [[quasilinear utility]] function, of the form
:&lt;math&gt;v(x,y)=x+\gamma v_Y(y)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v_Y&lt;/math&gt; is a certain monotonically increasing function. Because the MRS is a function &lt;math&gt;\lambda(y)&lt;/math&gt;, a possible function &lt;math&gt;v_Y&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated as an integral of &lt;math&gt;\lambda(y)&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="PruzanJackson1963"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/ledelseogerhvervsoekonomi/article/view/28451/54967 | title=On the Development of Utility Spaces for Multi-Goal Systems | author=Peter Mark Pruzan and J. T. Ross Jackson | journal=Ledelse og Erhvervsøkonomi/Handelsvidenskabeligt Tidsskrift/Erhvervsøkonomisk Tidsskrift | year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KeeneyRaiffa1993/&gt;{{rp|87}}
:&lt;math&gt;v_Y(y)=\int_{0}^{y}{\lambda(y') dy'}&lt;/math&gt; 
In this case, all the indifference curves are parallel – they are horizontal transfers of each other.

== Additivity with two goods ==
A more general type of utility function is an [[additive function]]:
:&lt;math&gt;v(x,y)=v_X(x)+v_Y(y)&lt;/math&gt;

There are several ways to check whether given preferences are representable by an additive utility function.

=== Double cancellation property ===
If the preferences are additive then a simple arithmetic calculation shows that
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1)\succeq (x_2,y_2)&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;(x_2,y_3)\succeq(x_3,y_1) &lt;/math&gt; implies 
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_3)\succeq(x_3,y_2)&lt;/math&gt;
so this "double-cancellation" property is a necessary condition for additivity.

[[Debreu theorems|Debreu (1960)]] showed that this property is also sufficient: i.e., if a preference relation satisfies the double-cancellation property then it can be represented by an additive utility function.&lt;ref name="Ted"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Courses/GraduateTheoryUCSB/separabilitynotes.pdf | title=Lecture Notes on Separable Preferences | publisher=UCSB Econ | accessdate=18 August 2015 | author=Bergstrom, Ted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corresponding tradeoffs property ===
If the preferences are represented by an additive function, then a simple arithmetic calculation shows that
:&lt;math&gt;MRS(x_2,y_2)=\frac{MRS(x_1,y_2)\cdot MRS(x_2,y_1)}{MRS(x_1,y_1)}&lt;/math&gt; 
so this "corresponding tradeoffs" property is a necessary condition for additivity. 
This condition is also sufficient.&lt;ref name=LuceTukey1964&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-2496(64)90015-x|title=Simultaneous conjoint measurement: A new type of fundamental measurement|journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|volume=1|pages=1|year=1964|last1=Luce|first1=R.Duncan|last2=Tukey|first2=John W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KeeneyRaiffa1993/&gt;{{rp|91}}

== Additivity with three or more goods ==
{{anchor|additivity3}}
When there are three or more commodities, the condition for the additivity of the utility function is surprisingly ''simpler'' than for two commodities. This is an outcome of [[Debreu theorems|Theorem 3 of Debreu (1960)]]. The condition required for additivity is '''preferential independence'''.&lt;ref name=KeeneyRaiffa1993/&gt;{{rp|104}}

A subset A of commodities is said to be ''preferentially independent'' of a subset B of commodities, if the preference relation in subset A, given constant values for subset B, is independent of these constant values. For example, suppose there are three commodities: ''x'' ''y'' and ''z''. The subset {''x'',''y''} is preferentially-independent of the subset {''z''}, if for all &lt;math&gt;x_i,y_i,z,z'&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1, z)\preceq (x_2,y_2, z) \iff (x_1,y_1, z')\preceq (x_2,y_2, z')&lt;/math&gt;.
In this case, we can simply say that:
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1)\preceq (x_2,y_2)&lt;/math&gt; for constant ''z''.

Preferential independence makes sense in case of [[independent goods]]. For example, the preferences between bundles of apples and bananas are probably independent of the number of shoes and socks that an agent has, and vice versa.

By Debreu's theorem, if all subsets of commodities are preferentially independent of their complements, then the preference relation can be represented by an additive value function. Here we provide an intuitive explanation of this result by showing how such an additive value function can be constructed.&lt;ref name=KeeneyRaiffa1993/&gt; The proof assumes three commodities: ''x'', ''y'', ''z''. We show how to define three points for each of the three value functions &lt;math&gt;v_x, v_y, v_z&lt;/math&gt;: the 0 point, the 1 point and the 2 point. Other points can be calculated in a similar way, and then continuity can be used to conclude that the functions are well-defined in their entire range.

'''0 point''': choose arbitrary &lt;math&gt;x_0,y_0,z_0&lt;/math&gt; and assign them as the zero of the value function, i.e.:
:&lt;math&gt;v_x(x_0)=v_y(y_0)=v_z(z_0)=0&lt;/math&gt;

'''1 point''': choose arbitrary &lt;math&gt;x_1&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_0,z_0)\succ(x_0,y_0,z_0)&lt;/math&gt;. Set it as the unit of value, i.e.:
:&lt;math&gt;v_x(x_1)=1&lt;/math&gt;
Choose &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; such that the following indifference relations hold: 
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_0,z_0)\sim(x_0,y_1,z_0)\sim(x_0,y_0,z_1)&lt;/math&gt;. 
This indifference serves to scale the units of ''y'' and ''z'' to match those of ''x''. The value in these three points should be 1, so we assign
:&lt;math&gt;v_y(y_1)=v_z(z_1)=1&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 point''': Now we use the preferential-independence assumption. The relation between &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_1)&lt;/math&gt; is independent of ''z'', and similarly the relation between &lt;math&gt;(y_1,z_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y_0,z_1)&lt;/math&gt; is independent of ''x'' and the relation between &lt;math&gt;(z_1,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(z_0,x_1)&lt;/math&gt; is independent of ''y''. Hence
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_0,z_1)\sim(x_0,y_1,z_1)\sim(x_1,y_1,z_0).&lt;/math&gt;
This is useful because it means that the function ''v'' can have the same value – 2 – in these three points. Select &lt;math&gt;x_2, y_2, z_2&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;(x_2,y_0,z_0)\sim(x_0,y_2,z_0)\sim(x_0,y_0,z_2)\sim(x_1,y_1,z_0)&lt;/math&gt;
and assign
:&lt;math&gt;v_x(x_2)=v_x(y_2)=v_x(z_2)=2.&lt;/math&gt;

'''3 point''': To show that our assignments so far are consistent, we must show that all points that receive a total value of 3 are indifference points. Here, again, the preferential independence assumption is used, since the relation between &lt;math&gt;(x_2,y_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1)&lt;/math&gt; is independent of ''z'' (and similarly for the other pairs); hence
:&lt;math&gt;(x_2,y_0,z_1)\sim(x_1,y_1,z_1)&lt;/math&gt;
and similarly for the other pairs. Hence, the 3 point is defined consistently.

We can continue like this by induction and define the per-commodity functions in all integer points, then use continuity to define it in all real points.

An implicit assumption in point 1 of the above proof is that all three commodities are ''essential'' or ''preference relevant''.&lt;ref name=Ted/&gt;{{rp|7}} This means that there exists a bundle such that, if the amount of a certain commodity is increased, the new bundle is strictly better.

The proof for more than 3 commodities is similar. In fact, we do not have to check that all subsets of points are preferentially independent; it is sufficient to check a linear number of pairs of commodities. E.g., if there are &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; different commodities, &lt;math&gt;j=1,...,m&lt;/math&gt;, then it is sufficient to check that for all &lt;math&gt;j=1,...,m-1&lt;/math&gt;, the two commodities &lt;math&gt;\{x_j,x_{j+1}\}&lt;/math&gt; are preferentially independent of the other &lt;math&gt;m-2&lt;/math&gt; commodities.&lt;ref name=KeeneyRaiffa1993/&gt;{{rp|115}}

=== Uniqueness of additive representation ===
An additive preference relation can be represented by many different additive utility functions. However, all these functions are similar: they are not only increasing monotone transformations of each other ([[#Uniqueness|as are all utility functions representing the same relation]]); they are increasing [[linear transformation]]s of each other.&lt;ref name=Ted/&gt;{{rp|9}} In short,
::An additive ordinal utility function is ''unique up to increasing linear transformation''.

'''''Paying for It''''', "a comic strip memoir about being a [[John (prostitution)|john]]", is a 2011  [[graphic novel]] by [[Canada|Canadian]] [[cartoonist]] [[Chester Brown]].  A combination of [[memoir]] and [[polemic]], the book explores Brown's decision to give up on romantic love and to take up the life of a "john" by frequenting [[prostitution|prostitutes]].  The book, published by [[Drawn and Quarterly]], was controversial, and a [[bestseller]].

The book is concerned with Brown's conflicting desire to have sex, but not wanting to have another girlfriend after his partner [[Sook-Yin Lee]] breaks up with him.  His solution is to forgo traditional boyfriend/girlfriend relationships and [[marriage]].  He takes up frequenting prostitutes, and comes to advocate prostitution as superior and to "possessive monogamy" of traditional male–female relations, which he debates with his friends throughout the book.

Brown presents his views in detail in the closing 50-page text section, which includes a 23-part appendix, end notes, and a note from friend and fellow cartoonist [[Seth (cartoonist)|Seth]].  Despite being about the separation of sex from romantic love, Brown calls the book "a type of love story".{{sfn|Kohler|2011a}}

==Overview==
After then-girlfriend [[Sook-Yin Lee]] breaks up with him in 1996, Brown, who lacks the social skills to pick up women,{{sfn|Brown|2011|pp=15, 262–264}} spends a [[celibacy|celibate]] three years mulling over what he sees as the negative aspects of romantic love in the modern world.  He continues to live with Sook-Yin, even after she brings other men to live with them, and Brown witnesses their lovers' spats.  He decides never to pursue a relationship with any one woman again — a condition he calls "possessive [[monogamy]]"{{sfn|Brown|2011|p=224}}—but he has "two competing desires -- &lt;!-- two dashes in the original --&gt;the desire to have sex, versus the desire to '''NOT'''&lt;!-- bold &amp; all-caps in the original --&gt; have a girlfriend."{{sfnm|1a1=MacDonald|1y=2010|2a1=Brown|2y=2011|2p=16}}

Eventually, he works up the courage to see a prostitute.  He rides around on his bicycle looking for [[Street prostitution|streetwalkers]], but being unsuccessful, turns to the ads in the backs of free [[alternative newspaper]]s.  After his first experience, he feels free from a "burden"{{sfnm|1a1=Kohler|1y=2011b|2a1=Brown|2y=2011|2p=48}} he has carried from adolescence.{{sfn|Kohler|2011b}}

Over the course of 33 chapters, Brown depicts his experiences with each of the 23 prostitutes he has visited, giving each at least a chapter of her own.  He gives details of their physical features and sexual performances, while obscuring their faces and ethnicities and giving them false names.  He "becomes an expert" and goes into the details of the trade, learning how to solicit and [[tip (gratuity)|tip]], and what the abbreviations in johns' reviews at the Toronto escort review board mean.{{sfn|Park|2011}}  At first he uses the [[pseudonym]] "Steve McDougal" in his encounters, but, feeling he has nothing to hide, soon reverts to using his real name.{{sfn|Lucas|2011}}

Between his encounters with prostitutes are scenes of himself discussing and debating the issue with his friends, especially fellow cartoonists [[Gregory Gallant|Seth]] and [[Joe Matt]].  Much of the humour in the book comes from the dialogue in these scenes.{{sfn|Collins|2011}}

In the final chapter, "Back to Monogamy", he ends up with one particular prostitute, "Denise" (albeit in a strictly financial way) for seven years as of the book's publication.  Brown ends the book still wondering about the nature of love, and insisting that "paying for sex isn’t an empty experience if you’re paying the right person for sex",{{sfn|Brown|2011|p=227}} but leaves the question of romantic love essentially open.{{sfn|Medley|2011b}}{{efn|"In our culture, we're always having this discussion about what romantic love is. So I guess I leave it open for that reason. I don't think anyone's really sure what we mean by romantic love or love in general. We know it when we feel it." — Brown, in 2011 interview with Mark Medley at the ''Ottawa Citizen''{{sfn|Medley|2011b}} }}

===Notes and appendices===
The book comes with a 50-page text section, including a bibliography,{{sfn|Garner|2011|p=2}} footnotes and an appendix in 23 parts that argues for a system in which "paying for sex is preferable to romance-based methods".{{sfn|Publishers Weekly staff|2011}}  It includes some commentary by his friend and fellow cartoonist [[Seth (cartoonist)|Seth]], who disagrees with Brown's position and accuses him of having no emotions, but then goes on to say, "The funny thing about Chester is that out of all the men I know he’s quite possibly the one I think would make the most considerate boyfriend or husband for a woman...and yet he is the one who picked the whoring."{{sfnm|1a1=Park|1y=2011|2a1=Brown|2y=2011|2pp=255–257}}

The appendices underscore the book's "political undercurrent", motivated by people's prejudices against those who buy and sell sex.  Brown says he wanted a book that presented the john's side of things, as he does not see himself as an "evil monster", and wants people to understand his perspective.{{sfn|Kohler|2011a}}

Brown says he doesn't expect every reader to read through all of the text portions of the book, and that he himself rarely reads the notes or appendices in the books he reads.  He said, "I wanted the material to be there for anyone who wanted a bit of background or to know what I thought about a particular subject in more depth."{{sfn|McGillis|2011a}}

==Political background==
Brown is a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and ran as the [[Libertarian Party of Canada]] candidate for the [[Trinity-Spadina]] riding in the Canadian federal elections of [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008]]{{sfn|Weissblott|2008}} and [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wagner|1y=2011|2a1=West Annex News staff|2y=2011}}  Brown takes the position throughout the book and its lengthy appendix that prostitution should be decriminalized, and as a libertarian insists the sex trade should not be regulated by the government.

The book was on the verge of completion when [[Ontario]] judge [[Susan Himel]] [[Bedford v. Canada|struck down several prostitution-related laws]] in September 2010, which was to be appealed by the government of Canada in June 2011.  "I was wishing that the book was out at that point,[...b]ut I hope it becomes influential enough to become part of the debate," Brown said.{{sfn|Vallely|2011}}

The book's release party was on May 1, 2011, the day before the Canadian federal election of that year, in which Brown was running as the Libertarian Party of Canada candidate for the [[Trinity-Spadina]] riding.  The election was called early after a [[motion of no confidence]] on March 25 resulted in the dissolution of Parliament.  "Initially, I was a bit annoyed by the timing of the election," Brown said, "but it might turn out to be a good thing that I’m getting publicity at this time."{{sfn|Wagner|2011}}  Brown came fifth in his [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] with 454 votes, losing to [[incumbent]] [[Olivia Chow]].{{sfn|West Annex News staff|2011}}

==Style==
[[File:ChesterBrownPayingForItPanel WhatDoYouDoForALiving.jpg| thumb | left | 250px | [[Chester Brown|Brown]] obscures the faces of all the [[prostitute]]s in the book ]]
Brown employs a "clinical"{{sfn|Murray|2011a}} style with pages structured in an eight-[[panel (comics)|panel]] grid{{sfn|Mautner|2011}} which may have been inspired by the comics of [[Carl Barks]],{{sfn|McKay|2011}} and which "he never veers from"{{sfn|Mautner|2011}} (somewhat like the six-panel pages he used in ''[[Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography|Louis Riel]]''), "using frail, tiny figures, preventing our involvement with the bodies depicted on the page." The women's faces are obscured by [[word balloon]]s.{{sfn|Rogers|2011a}}  Brown says that over the years he has "become less comfortable portraying emotion," and went so far as to scrap 30–40 pages of work around 2007 when he felt he had put too much emotion in the artwork.{{sfn|Adams|2011b}}

While Brown himself has been totally open about his visits with prostitutes,{{sfn|Medley|2011a}} all the prostitutes in the book are depicted as "faceless brunettes",{{sfn|Collins|2011}} in order to keep the real women in the story from being identified by friends and family.  Brown speculates that a prose treatment may have had an advantage, in that it would not have required such an intrusive device to disguise the women.{{sfn|JB|2011}}

Brown says he wanted the minimalist style of the drawings to convey the ordinariness of paying for sex.{{sfn|Hays|2011}}  It is also his first major work to break from the traditional [[all-caps]] style of lettering in [[English language|English]]-language [[comic book]]s and [[comic strip|strips]].

Brown depicts himself showing little or no emotion.  In a scene in which he debates prostitutes' health care with Seth, his outrage surfaces not in his face, but in a thought balloon in which a thunderstorm rages and takes over the panel.{{sfn|Weldon|2011}}  It has been noted that, although Brown depicts himself as dry and emotionless, in real life he has a ready sense of humour.{{sfn|Morassutti|2011}}

===Influences===
Brown moved his drawing away from the overt [[Harold Gray]] influence (as seen in ''Louis Riel'' and ''[[Underwater (comics)|Underwater]]'') towards a style inspired by the "very stylized, stiff look" of [[Fletcher Hanks]].{{sfn|Rogers|2011b|p=1}}  Close friend Joe Matt also had an influence.  Some scenes deliberately echoed scenes in Matt's graphic novel ''Spent''.  He set scenes in places that had been depicted in Matt's comics, and did his own take on a restaurant scene that Matt had done.{{sfn|Rogers|2011b|p=3}}{{efn| "[...]there are several scenes in here which are deliberate echoes of things that happened in ''Spent''. Like, I set a scene in the Ten Editions bookstore just because Joe had a scene in it[...]And the scene where we’re in the restaurant and the waitress asks if we’re artists — Joe had a similar scene in his book, but I show it the way I think it really would have happened because Joe’s version was totally inaccurate.[...]There are a couple other things like that, where I’m echoing Joe." — Brown in 2011 interview with Sean Rogers{{sfn|Rogers|2011b|p=3}} }}

Brown cites the "austerity" of the films of [[Robert Bresson]], who "instructed his actors not to show any emotion on their faces",{{sfnm|1a1=Adams|1y=2011b|2a1=Murray|2y=2011b}} as a major influence.{{sfn|Rogers|2011b|p=1}}

==Subject matter==

===Advocacy===
While Brown had explored [[Chester Brown's autobiographical comics|autobiography]] in the past, he makes clear that advocacy is the prime motivation for the book.  He says that, if he had thought a fictional treatment would have served his purposes better, then that would have been the route he would have taken.  He had considered that angle, but in the end decided that he wanted to make it clear that he had a personal stake in the issue based on his own experiences as a john.{{sfn|McGillis|2011b}}

''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic [[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]] compared Brown's pro-prostitution position to that of political philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]].{{sfn|Garner|2011|p=2}}{{efn|"Mr. Brown’s fundamental pro-prostitution argument — he considers it a feminist one — is not dissimilar to one put forward by the political philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] in the wake of the 2008 call-girl scandal that forced Gov. [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal|Eliot Spitzer]] of New York to resign." — Dwight Garner{{sfn|Garner|2011|p=2}} }}  He also puts forward the idea that [[Feminism|feminists]] should be more consistent when it comes to the [[Abortion-rights movement|right to choose]] — as with [[abortion]], "it's her body, it's her right".{{sfnm|1a1=Garner|1y=2011|1p=2|2a1=Brown|2y=2011|2p=240}}

===Male–female relations===
Brown has focused on his problems with relating to women in previous works, most notably in his books ''[[The Playboy: A Comic Book|The Playboy]]'' and ''[[I Never Liked You]]''.

Brown began to question traditional male–female relations after he had read ''Cerebus'' [[Mothers and Daughters (comics)#Issue 186|#186]],{{sfn|Rogers|2011b|p=4}} which contained an essay attacking the modern state of such relations.  After Sook-Yin Lee broke up with him, he felt that he no longer wanted to deal with the tensions of being in a boyfriend–girlfriend relationship.  After three years of staying celibate, he decided he would start seeing prostitutes, although at first he was hesitant, as he did not want to be seen as a "loser".{{sfn|CBC staff|2011}}

Brown made his visiting of prostitutes known to his friends and relatives (except for his stepmother) shortly after his first visit,{{sfn|Medley|2011a}} and it had been made public long before the appearance of ''Paying for It'', as in his interview with Dave Sim in ''Cerebus'' #295–297,{{sfn|Sim|2003}}  That he had been working on a graphic novel on the subject had been known in comics circles at least since 2004 when, in an interview with ''[[The Pulse (comics news)|The Pulse]]'', he says he explores some of [[René Girard]]'s theories of the origin of desire in his then-yet-unnamed book,{{sfn|MacDonald|2004}} and its appearance was much anticipated.{{sfnm|1a1=Hains|1y=2010|2a1=Mautner|2y=2010|3a1=Heer|3y=2010|4a1=Spurgeon|4y=2010}}

Brown's aversion to relationships with women drew tentative comparisons to friend and fellow cartoonist [[Dave Sim]], known for his controversial views on women.  Brown responded to this by saying, "...I don't think women are intellectually inferior to men. But I like being alone."  Brown also publicly debated the subject with Sim in the ''Getting Riel'' interview, while acknowledging that "[[Cerebus the Aardvark|Cerebus]] #186 [''the issue in which Sim first laid out his controversial views''] did push me in the direction of questioning the whole romantic relationship thing".{{sfn|Sim|2003|loc=part 1}}

===Depictions of real people===
Brown had originally intended the book to cover the history of his sex life, including [[Virginity#Loss of virginity|losing his virginity]] and going through all his girlfriends, but two of his former girlfriends with whom he was still friends ([[Sook-Yin Lee]] and the Kris of ''[[Chester Brown's autobiographical comics#Helder|Helder]]'', ''[[Chester Brown's autobiographical comics#Showing Helder|Showing Helder]]'' and ''The Playboy'') objected to their stories being told in his book.{{sfn|Rogers|2011b|p=4}}  He also intended to include more details of the prostitutes he visited, such as their interests and the conversations they had, but was afraid too much detail could identify them — he chose to respect their anonymity; this includes "Denise", the prostitute with whom he ended up having a long-term, monogamous relationship, and who refused to have more of herself included in the book.{{sfn|Rogers|2011b|p=1}}  Brown did not try to contact the other prostitutes about their portrayals.{{sfn|JB|2011}}

Conversations and debates with Dave Sim were also dropped, as their friendship fell through over Brown's refusal to sign an online petition asserting Sim was not a [[misogyny|misogynist]],{{sfn|Brown|2011|p=276}} it would have been awkward for him to ask Sim for permission to include those scenes.{{sfn|Rogers|2011b|p=4}}

====People depicted====
;[[Sook-Yin Lee]]:Brown's third and last girlfriend.{{sfn|JB|2011}}  After she breaks up with him, he forswears the "possessive monogamy" of traditional male–female relationships.
;[[Seth (cartoonist)|Seth]]:Friend and fellow cartoonist, Seth spars with Brown over the issue of prostitution.  He also provides the twenty-third appendix to the book.
;[[Joe Matt]]:Friend and fellow cartoonist, Matt has also been celibate for a long stretch, and takes issue when Brown "cut[s] in line"{{sfn|Thompson|2011}} and has sex before he does.  The book is dedicated to him.
;[[Justin Peroff]]:A musician whom Lee starts seeing when she breaks up with Brown.  He moves in with Brown and Lee for a time, but eventually breaks up with Lee and moves out two years later.
;Kris Nakamura:Brown's first girlfriend, who has appeared in some of [[Chester Brown's autobiographical comics|Brown's autobiographical comics]] in the past.  As of the publication of ''Paying For It'', they had remained close friends for close to thirty years.
;Gordon Brown:Chester's younger brother, who is happily married{{sfn|Randle|2011}} and lives in [[Quebec City]] at the time the book takes place.{{sfn|Brown|2011|p=230}}

==Reception==
While it was not surprising that a work by a cartoonist of Brown's standing would receive accolades from his peers and critics{{sfnm|1a1=Matheson|1y=2011|2a1=Matthieu|2y=2011}} (being called "some of the best comics of Brown’s career"{{sfn|McKay|2011}} and "book of the year"{{sfn|Heer|2011|p=1}}), neither was it surprising that the book would be the focus of controversy.  The subject matter and Brown's didactic approach to it were expected from the outset to draw fire, but some found Brown's approach to have more aesthetic repercussions:

{{Quote|
"Out of consideration for the women, Brown doesn’t provide any background detail on the prostitutes he visits, although he does note that he spent a lot of time talking to them and learned much about their lives. He also says he dallied with a variety of ethnic types and hair styles, but — for fear perhaps that they may be recognized by family or friends — their faces are all obscured, and all are portrayed as white-skinned brunettes, (though it’s worth noting he does take care to denote individual body types, especially in regards to breast size). That doesn’t derail the book too badly but there is a palpable sense of something missing, an experience or emotional hole that needs to be filled. I can well understand and respect Brown’s desire to show as much consideration to these women as possible, but not having more female perspective in the book, particularly in a book about such a taboo and divisive subject, hurts the book both aesthetically and in terms of his larger points."|Chris Mautner{{sfn|Mautner|2011}}}}

The advocacy displayed in the voluminous pages of the appendix may have been a detriment to the work overall, according to [[Tom Spurgeon]] at The Comics Reporter; "Give me scenes like the one where Brown argues with Seth over the issues, seething and impatient with Seth's answers and his own, desperate and human in wanting to make and win such discussions, over any number of facile dissections of each argument's actual merits."{{sfn|Spurgeon|2011}}  Brad MacKay of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' found that them "often amusing" and "thought-provoking," but sometimes "reductive and didactic."{{sfn|McKay|2011}}  Critic R. Fiore found that Brown doesn't argue points well.{{sfn|Fiore|2011}}

Obscuring the faces of the prostitutes could be seen as Brown [[Objectification|objectifying]] them, and with a feeling the book lacks a female perspective, "especially since all we see of them is their frequently naked bodies."{{sfn|McKay|2011}}  Brown has also been criticized for treading lightly over darker issues, like [[human trafficking]],{{sfn|Kohler|2011b}} an oversight he acknowledges yet largely dismisses in the appendix;{{sfn|Garner|2011|p=2}}{{efn|"He considers — and largely if not entirely dismisses — concerns about troubling issues like [[sex slavery]], thieving [[pimp]]s and abuse." — Dwight Garner in ''[[The New York Times]]''{{sfn|Garner|2011|p=2}} }} and [[class (social)|class]], one he barely acknowledges.{{sfn|Randle|2011}}  Matt Seneca objected to paying for the book, as he felt the money would indirectly pay for the exploitation of prostitutes.{{sfn|Seneca|2011}}  Brown also raised eyebrows by claiming physical [[drug addiction]] doesn't exist.{{sfnm|1a1=Mautner|1y=2011|2a1=Randle|2y=2011|3a1=Brown|3y=2011|3pp=250–251}}

==Other media==
In May 2012, Sook-Yin Lee told ''[[St. Joseph Communications#Ottawa Magazine|Ottawa Magazine]]'' that she would be directing a film adaptation of ''Paying for It''.  The script was being prepared by Lee, Brown and Adam Litovitz, with an eye towards making the story less didactic and episodic.{{sfn|Sayani|2012}}

==Publication history==
The book was the first of Brown's books not to be serialized.  Brown originally intended ''Louis Riel'' to be published this way, but was convinced by [[Drawn and Quarterly]] editor-in-chief [[Chris Oliveros]] to publish it as a series.{{sfn|MacDonald|2004}}  Following poor sales of the ''Louis Riel'' comic-book serialization,{{sfn|McGillis|2011a}} Oliveros relented and gave Brown the go-ahead to publish ''Paying For It'' directly in book form.  It was supported, as ''Louis Riel'' was,{{sfn|Canada Council Research Unit|2001|p=29}} by a grant from the [[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Arts]], this time for [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] $16,000 which he received in 2005.{{sfnm|1a1=Canada Council Research Unit|1y=2005|1p=30|2a1=Weissblott|2y=2011}}

The title was not what Brown would have wanted.  He wanted to have a more direct title that used words like "sex", "prostitute" or "trick".{{sfn|McGillis|2011b}}  Some of the titles he floated around were ''I Pay for Sex''{{sfn|Wagner|2011}} or ''The Sex Life of John Brown''{{sfn|Kohler|2011a}} but his publishers asked him to call it ''Paying for It'', a title which rubbed him the wrong way, as "[i]t suggests that not only am I paying for sex but I’m also paying for being a john in some non-monetary way. Many would think that there’s an emotional cost — that johns are sad and lonely...I haven’t been 'paying for it' in any of those ways. I’m very far from being sad or lonely, I haven’t caught an [[Sexually transmitted disease|S-T-D]], I haven’t been arrested, I haven’t lost my career, and my friends and family haven’t rejected me."  He says that if he had insisted, Drawn and Quarterly would have allowed him to call the book what he wanted,{{sfn|McGillis|2011b}}{{efn|"But let me be clear that my publishers did not force the title on me.  I chose to give in to what they wanted.  If I had insisted, they would have allowed me to put whatever words I wanted on the cover." — Chester Brown in ''Paying for It''{{sfn|Brown|2011|p=259}} }} but Brown allowed the change of title, acknowledging how difficult the book would be to market.{{sfnm|1a1=Kohler|1y=2011a|2a1=Brown|2y=2011|2p=259}}

Following the success of ''Louis Riel'', Drawn and Quarterly anticipated high sales, printing nearly 20,000 copies of the first, hardcover edition of the book,{{sfn|Adams|2011a}}  for its May 3, 2011 release.{{sfn|Burns|2011}}  The introduction was by famous [[Underground comix|underground]] cartoonist [[Robert Crumb]], and the book includes quotes from Brown's peers such as [[Alan Moore]] and [[Neil Gaiman]], as well as from writer and former [[call-girl]] [[Tracy Quan]], sex columnist [[Sasha (journalist)|Sasha]], and a number of academics.

The book reached #2 on Amazon's "Bestsellers in Graphic Novels" list, and on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] it debuted at #2 on the "Hardcover Graphic Books" list{{sfnm|1a1=Gustines|1y=2011|2a1=New York Times staff|2y=2011a}} and reached #1 that July.{{sfn|New York Times staff|2011b}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">The '''Petersen matrix''' is a comprehensive description of systems of [[biochemistry|biochemical reactions]] used to model [[chemical reactor|reactors]] for [[Biodegradability prediction|pollution control]] (engineered [[decomposition]]) as well as in [[environmental systems]]. It has got as many columns as the number of relevant involved components ([[chemicals]], [[pollutants]], [[biomass]]es, [[gases]]) and as many rows as the number of involved [[Chemical process|processes]] (biochemical reactions and physical degradation). One further column is added to host the description of the [[kinetics (chemistry)|kinetics]] of each transformation ([[rate equation]]).&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=David L.|title=Practical wastewater treatment|year=2006|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-471-78044-1|pages=288|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471780448.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fang&gt;{{cite book|last=Fang|first=editor, Herbert H.P.|title=Environmental anaerobic technology : applications and new developments|year=2010|publisher=Imperial College Press|location=London|isbn=9781848165427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matrix structure ==
The mass conservation principle for each process is expressed in the rows of the matrix. If all components are included (none omitted) then the mass conservation principle states that, for each process:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{for all process } i:\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}\dot{\rho_j} = 0 \;,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{\rho_j}&lt;/math&gt; is the density rate of each component. This can also be seen as the process [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric relation]].

Moreover, the rate of variation of each component for all processes simultaneous effect can be easily assessed by summing the columns:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{for all component } j: \frac{\partial C_j}{\partial t} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{ij} r_i \; ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; are the reaction rates of each process.

== Example ==
A system of a third [[Order of reaction|order reaction]] followed by a [[Michaelis-Menten]] enzyme reaction.

:&lt;chem&gt;
{A} + 2B -&gt; S
&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;
{E} + S &lt;=&gt;[k_f][k_r] ES -&gt;[k_\mathrm{cat}] {E} + P
&lt;/chem&gt;

where the reagents A and B combine forming the substrate S (S = AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which with the help of enzyme E is transformed into the product P.
Production rates for each substance is:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d [\ce A]}{d t} &amp;= -k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2
\\
\frac{d [\ce B]}{d t} &amp;= -2 k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2
\\

Therefore, the Petersen matrix reads as

The Petersen matrix can be used to write the system's rate equation

{{Political corruption sidebar}}

'''Political corruption''' is the use of powers by government officials or their network contacts for illegitimate private gain. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties, is done under [[color of law]] or involves [[Influence peddling|trading in influence]].

Forms of [[corruption]] vary, but include [[bribery]], [[extortion]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], [[parochialism]], [[patronage]], [[influence peddling]], [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and [[embezzlement]]. Corruption may facilitate [[Organized crime|criminal enterprise]] such as [[drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking]], though is not restricted to these activities. Misuse of [[government]] power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general [[police brutality]], is also considered political corruption. [[Corruption in Lithuania#Examples post-2016|Masiulis case]] is a typical example of political corruption.

The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, some political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or ill-defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions.
Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|title=African corruption 'on the wane'|date=10 July 2007|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a [[kleptocracy]], literally meaning "rule by thieves".

Some forms of corruption – now called "institutional corruption"&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis. ''Ethics in Congress: From Individual to Institutional Corruption'' (Washington DC: Brookings Institution Press, 1995).  {{ISBN|0-8157-8423-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; – are distinguished from bribery and other kinds of obvious personal gain.  A similar problem of corruption arises in any institution that depends on financial support from people who have interests that may conflict with the primary purpose of the institution.

Over time, corruption has been defined differently. For example, in a simple context, while performing work for a government or as a representative, it is unethical to accept a gift. Any free gift could be construed as a scheme to lure the recipient towards some biases. In most cases, the gift is seen as an intention to seek certain favors such as work promotion, tipping in order to win a contract, job or exemption from certain tasks in the case of junior employee giving the gift to a senior employee who can be key in winning the favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanzi|first=Vito|date=1998-12-01|title=Corruption Around the World: Causes, Consequences, Scope, and Cures|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.2307/3867585|journal=Staff Papers|language=en|volume=45|issue=4|pages=559–594|doi=10.2307/3867585|issn=0020-8027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
===Effects on politics, administration, and institutions===
In politics, corruption undermines democracy and [[good governance]] by flouting or even subverting formal processes. Corruption in elections and in the legislature reduces accountability and distorts representation in policymaking; corruption in the judiciary compromises the [[rule of law]]; and corruption in [[public administration]] results in the inefficient provision of services.  It violates a basic principle of [[republicanism]] regarding the centrality of civic virtue.&lt;ref name="www-wds.worldbank"/&gt;

More generally, corruption erodes the institutional capacity of government if procedures are disregarded, resources are siphoned off, and public offices are bought and sold. Corruption undermines the legitimacy of government and such democratic values as trust and tolerance. Recent evidence suggests that variation in the levels of corruption amongst high-income democracies can vary significantly depending on the level of accountability of decision-makers.&lt;ref name="www-wds.worldbank"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamilton |first= Alexander |year=2013 |title= Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf |format=PDF |publisher= World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from [[fragile state]]s also shows that corruption and bribery can adversely impact trust in institutions.&lt;ref name="bath.ac.uk"&gt;Hamilton, A. and Hudson, J. (2014) The Tribes that Bind: Attitudes to the Tribe and Tribal Leader in the Sudan. Bath Economic Research Papers 31/14. [http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/31-14.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton, A 2014"&gt;Hamilton, A. and Hudson, J. (2014) Bribery and Identity: Evidence from Sudan. Bath Economic Research Papers 30/14.[http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/30-14.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption can also impact government’s provision of goods and services. It increases the costs of goods and services which arise efficiency loss. In the absence of corruption, governmental projects might be cost-effective at their true costs, however, once corruption costs are included projects may not be cost-effective so they are not executed distorting the provision of goods and services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Economic effects===
{{see also|Economics of corruption|Corporate crime}}
In the [[private sector]], corruption increases the cost of business through the price of illicit payments themselves, the management cost of negotiating with officials and the risk of breached agreements or detection. Although some claim corruption reduces costs by cutting [[bureaucracy]], the availability of bribes can also induce officials to contrive new rules and delays. Openly removing costly and lengthy regulations are better than covertly allowing them to be bypassed by using bribes. Where corruption inflates the cost of business, it also distorts the field of inquiry and action, shielding firms with connections from competition and thereby sustaining inefficient firms.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros, [http://54pesos.org/2008/11/15/corruption-and-development-does-the-%E2%80%9Crule-of-law%E2%80%9D-factor-weigh-more-than-we-think "Corruption and development. Does the "rule of law" factor weigh more than we think?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102095104/http://54pesos.org/2008/11/15/corruption-and-development-does-the-%E2%80%9Crule-of-law%E2%80%9D-factor-weigh-more-than-we-think |date=2016-01-02 }} 54 Pesos (November 15, 2008).

Corruption may have a direct impact on the firm's effective marginal tax rate. Bribing tax officials can reduce tax payments of the firm if the marginal bribe rate is below the official marginal tax rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in Uganda, bribes have a higher negative impact on firms’ activity than taxation. Indeed, a one percentage point increase in bribes reduces firm’s annual growth by three percentage points, while an increase in 1 percentage point on taxes reduces firm’s growth by one percentage point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisman|first=Raymond|last2=Svensson|first2=Jakob|date=2007|title=Are corruption and taxation really harmful to growth? Firm level evidence|url=|journal=Journal of Development Economics|volume=83|issue=1|pages=63–75|doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2005.09.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption also generates economic distortion in the [[public sector]] by diverting public investment into capital projects where bribes and [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] are more plentiful. Officials may increase the technical complexity of public sector projects to conceal or pave the way for such dealings, thus further distorting investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uneca.org/aec/documents/Mina%20Baliamoune-Lutz_%20Leonce%20Ndikumana.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309123826/http://www.uneca.org/aec/documents/Mina%20Baliamoune-Lutz_%20Leonce%20Ndikumana.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-09 |title=Corruption and growth in African countries: Exploring the investment channel, lead author Mina Baliamoune-Lutz, Department of Economics |publisher=University of North Florida |page=1,2 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption also lowers compliance with construction, environmental, or other regulations, reduces the quality of government services and infrastructure, and increases budgetary pressures on government.

Economists argue that one of the factors behind the differing [[economic development]] in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] is that in Africa, corruption has primarily taken the form of [[rent seeking|rent extraction]] with the resulting [[financial capital]] moved overseas rather than invested at home (hence the stereotypical, but often accurate, image of African dictators having [[Swiss bank|Swiss bank accounts]]). In [[Nigeria]], for example, more than $400 billion was stolen from the treasury by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/nigerias-corruption-busters.html |title=Nigeria's corruption busters |publisher=Unodc.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] researchers estimated that from 1970 to 1996, [[capital flight]] from 30 [[Sub-Saharan]] countries totaled $187bn, exceeding those nations' external debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/Economy/200503140015 |title=When the money goes west |publisher=New Statesman |date=2005-03-14 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706191351/http://www.newstatesman.com/Economy/200503140015 |archivedate=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The results, expressed in retarded or suppressed development, have been modeled in theory by economist [[Mancur Olson]].) In the case of Africa, one of the factors for this behavior was political instability and the fact that new governments often confiscated previous government's corruptly obtained assets. This encouraged officials to stash their wealth abroad, out of reach of any future [[Nationalization|expropriation]]. In contrast, Asian administrations such as [[Suharto]]'s [[Orde Baru|New Order]] often took a cut on business transactions or provided conditions for development, through infrastructure investment, law and order, etc.

===Environmental and social effects===
{{further|Human impact on the environment}}
[[File:Corrupt-Legislation-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.35|Detail from ''Corrupt Legislation'' (1896) by [[Elihu Vedder]]. Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]
Corruption is often most evident in countries with the smallest per capita incomes, relying on foreign aid for health services. Local political interception of donated money from overseas is especially prevalent in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n nations, where it was reported in the 2006 [[World Bank|World Bank Report]] that about half of the funds that were donated for health usages were never invested into the health sectors or given to those needing medical attention.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=10.2307/20032209|title=The Challenge of Global Health on JSTOR|publisher=|doi=10.2307/20032209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, the donated money was expended through "[[Counterfeit medications|counterfeit drugs]], siphoning off of drugs to the black market, and payments to ghost employees". Ultimately, there is a sufficient amount of money for health in developing countries, but local corruption denies the wider citizenry the resource they require.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Corruption facilitates environmental destruction. While corrupt societies may have formal legislation to protect the environment, it cannot be enforced if officials can easily be bribed. The same applies to social rights worker protection, [[Trade union|unionization]] prevention, and [[child labor]]. Violation of these laws rights enables corrupt countries to gain illegitimate economic advantage in the international market.

The [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Amartya Sen]] has observed that "there is no such thing as an apolitical food problem." While drought and other naturally occurring events may trigger [[famine]] conditions, it is government action or inaction that determines its severity, and often even whether or not a famine will occur.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/08/15/wipro-tata-corruption-ent-law-cx_kw_0814whartonindia.html|title=Will Growth Slow Corruption In India?|publisher=Forbes | date=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments with strong tendencies towards [[kleptocracy]] can undermine [[food security]] even when harvests are good. Officials often steal state property. In [[Bihar]], [[India]], more than 80% of the subsidized food aid to poor is stolen by corrupt officials.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; Similarly, food aid is often robbed at gunpoint by governments, criminals, and warlords alike, and sold for a profit. The 20th century is full of many examples of governments undermining the food security of their own nations – sometimes intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheeter |first=Laura |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7111296.stm |title=Ukraine remembers famine horror |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-11-24 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on humanitarian aid===
The scale of [[humanitarian aid]] to the poor and unstable regions of the world grows, but it is highly [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] to corruption, with food aid, construction and other highly valued assistance as the most at risk.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Sarah Bailey (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2385&amp;title=corruption-risks-perceptions-prevention-humanitarian-assistance Need and greed: corruption risks, perceptions and prevention in humanitarian assistance] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Food aid can be directly and physically diverted from its intended destination, or indirectly through the manipulation of assessments, targeting, registration and distributions to favor certain groups or individuals.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

In construction and shelter there are numerous opportunities for diversion and profit through substandard workmanship, kickbacks for contracts and favouritism in the provision of valuable shelter material.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Thus while humanitarian aid agencies are usually most concerned about aid being diverted by including too many, recipients themselves are most concerned about exclusion.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Access to aid may be limited to those with connections, to those who pay bribes or are forced to give sexual favors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Equally, those able to do so may manipulate statistics to inflate the number of beneficiaries and siphon off additional assistance.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Malnutrition, illness, wounds, torture, harassment of specific groups within the population, disappearances, extra-judicial executions and the forcible displacement of people are all found in many armed conflicts. Aside from their direct effects on the individuals concerned, the consequences of these tragedies for local systems must also be considered: the destruction of crops and places of cultural importance, the breakdown of economic infrastructure and of health-care facilities such as hospitals, etc., etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/other/57jpcj.htm|title=The impact of humanitarian aid on conflict development - ICRC|first=Pierre|last=Perrin|date=30 June 1998|website=www.icrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on health===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

Corruption plays a huge role in health care system starting from the hospital, to the government and lifted to the other institutions that promote quality and affordable health care to the people. The efficiency of health care delivery in any country is heavily dependent on accountable and transparent systems, proper management of both financial and human resources and timely supply of services to the vulnerable populace of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nazim|first=Habibov|date=March 2016|title=Effect of corruption on healthcare satisfaction in post-soviet nations|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.01.044|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|pages= 119–124|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the basic level, greed skyrockets corruption. When the structure of the health care system is not adequately addressed beginning from oversight in healthcare delivery and supply of drugs and tendering process, mismanagement and misappropriation of funds will always be observed.Corruption also can undermine health care service delivery which in turn disorients the lives of the poor. Corruption leads to violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms as people supposed to benefit from the basic health care from the governments are denied due to unscrupulous processes driven by greed. Therefore, for a country to keep citizens healthy there must be efficient systems and proper resources that can tame the evils like corruption that underpin it.

=== Effects on Education ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

Education forms the basis and the fabric in which a society is transformed and different facets of well-being are shaped.Corruption in higher education has been prevalent and calls for immediate intervention. Increased corruption in higher education has led to growing global concern among governments, students and educators and other stakeholders. Those offering services in the higher education institutions are facing pressure that highly threatens the integral value of higher education enterprise. Corruption in higher education has a larger negative influence, it destroys the relation between personal effort and reward anticipation. Moreover, employees and students develop a belief that personal success does not come from hard work and merit but through canvassing with teachers and taking other shortcuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borcan|first=Oana|date=February 2017|title=Fighting corruption in education|url=|journal=American Economic Journal|volume= 9|pages= 180–209|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic promotions in the higher education institutions have been disabled by unlimited corruption. Presently, promotion is based on personal connections than professional achievements. This has led to dramatic increase in the number of professors and exhibits their rapid status loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altbach|first=Philiph|date=2015|title=The Question of Corruption|url=|journal=International Higher Education|volume= 34|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utmost the flawed processes in the academic institutions has led to unbaked graduates who are not well fit to the job market. Corruption hinders the international standards of an education system. Additionally, Plagiarism is a form of corruption in academic research, where it affects originality and disables learning. Individual violations are in close relation to the operation ways of a system.

Furthermore, the universities may be in relationships and dealings with business and people in government, which majority of them enrol in doctoral studies without the undergraduate program.Consequently, money, power and related influence compromise education standards since they are fueling factors. A Student may finish thesis report within a shorter time upon which compromises the quality of work delivered and questions the threshold of the higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heyneman|first=Stephen|date=2015|title=The corruption of ethics in higher education|url=|journal=International Higher Education|volume= 62|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other areas:public safety, trade unions, police corruption etc. ===
{{see also|academic corruption}}
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}&lt;!--many scandalous examples, each of which should have a reference to serious documentation--&gt;
Corruption is not specific to poor, developing, or transition countries. In western countries, cases of bribery and other forms of corruption in all possible fields exist: under-the-table payments made to reputed surgeons by patients attempting to be on top of the list of forthcoming surgeries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Cash+bribes+patients+atop+surgery+waiting+lists/3893239/story.html |title=Cash bribes put patients atop surgery waiting lists |publisher=''The Vancouver Sun'' |date=November 27, 2010 |last=Fidelman |first=Charlie |accessdate=2011-01-21 }}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; bribes paid by suppliers to the automotive industry in order to sell low-quality connectors used for instance in safety equipment such as airbags, bribes paid by suppliers to manufacturers of defibrillators (to sell low-quality capacitors), contributions paid by wealthy parents to the "social and culture fund" of a prestigious university in exchange for it to accept their children, bribes paid to obtain diplomas, financial and other advantages granted to unionists by members of the executive board of a car manufacturer in exchange for employer-friendly positions and votes, etc. Examples are endless.

These various manifestations of corruption can ultimately present a danger for public health; they can discredit specific, essential institutions or social relationships.   Osipian summarized a 2008 "study of corruption perceptions among Russians ... .30 percent of the respondents marked the level of corruption as very high, while another 44 percent as high. 19 percent considered it as average and only 1 percent as low. The most corrupt in people's minds are traffic police (33 percent), local authorities (28 percent), police (26 percent), healthcare (16 percent), and education (15 percent). 52 percent of the respondents had experiences of giving money or gifts to
medical professionals while 36 percent made informal payments to educators." He claimed that this corruption lowered the rate of economic growth in Russia, because the students disadvantaged by this corruption could not adopt better work methods as quickly, lowering thereby [[total factor productivity]] for Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osipian|first1=Ararat|title=Education Corruption, Reform, and Growth: Case of Post-Soviet Russia|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/17447/|website=Munich Personal RePEc Archive|publisher=Munich University Library|accessdate=2016-05-21|date=2009-09-22|ref = MPRA Paper No. 17447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption can also affect the various components of sports activities (referees, players, medical and laboratory staff involved in anti-doping controls, members of national sport federation and international committees deciding about the allocation of contracts and competition places).

Cases exist against (members of) various types of non-profit and non-government organizations, as well as religious organizations.

Ultimately, the distinction between public and private sector corruption sometimes appears rather artificial, and national anti-corruption initiatives may need to avoid legal and other loopholes in the coverage of the instruments.

==Types==

===Bribery===
{{Main|Bribery}}
In the context of political corruption, a bribe may involve a payment given to a government official in exchange of his use of official powers. [[Bribery]] requires two participants: one to give the bribe, and one to take it. Either may initiate the corrupt offering; for example, a customs official may demand bribes to let through allowed (or disallowed) goods, or a smuggler might offer bribes to gain passage. In some countries the culture of corruption extends to every aspect of public life, making it extremely difficult for individuals to operate without resorting to bribes. Bribes may be demanded in order for an official to do something he is already paid to do. They may also be demanded in order to bypass laws and regulations. In addition to their role in private financial gain, bribes are also used to intentionally and maliciously cause harm to another (i.e. no financial incentive).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In some developing nations, up to half of the population has paid bribes during the past 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2005/09_12_2005_barometer_2005 |title= How common is bribe-paying? |quote=...a relatively high proportion of families in a group of Central Eastern European, African, and Latin American countries paid a bribe in the previous twelve months. |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120405045051/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2005/09_12_2005_barometer_2005 |archivedate= April 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Europe]] dissociates active and passive bribery and to incriminates them as separate offences:

* One can define '''active bribery''' as "the promising, offering or giving by any person, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage to any of its public officials, for himself or herself or for anyone else, for him or her to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions" (article 2 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168007f3f5 |title= Criminal Law Convention on Corruption: CETS No. 173 |publisher= Conventions.coe.int |accessdate= 2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Council of Europe]]). 
* '''Passive bribery''' can be defined as "when committed intentionally, the request or receipt by any [...] public officials, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage, for himself or herself or for anyone else, or the acceptance of an offer or a promise of such an advantage, to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions" (article 3 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

This dissociation aims to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting an advantage) of a corrupt deal already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal-policy point-of-view) that bribery is not acceptable.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Furthermore, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. In addition, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a "fee" to the decision maker to obtain a favorable decision. A working definition of corruption is also provided as follows in article 3 of the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174):&lt;ref name="conventions"/&gt;  ''For the purpose of this Convention, "corruption" means requesting, offering, giving or accepting, directly or indirectly, a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, which distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe, the undue advantage or the prospect thereof.

===Trading in influence===
{{Main|Influence peddling}}
[[File:The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|"The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler" (1889)|Reformers like the American [[Joseph Keppler]] depicted the Senate as controlled by the giant moneybags, who represented the nation's financial trusts and monopolies.]]
Trading in influence, or [[influence peddling]], refers a person selling his/her influence over the decision making process to benefit a third party (person or institution). The difference with bribery is that this is a tri-lateral relation. From a legal point of view, the role of the third party (who is the target of the influence) does not really matter although he/she can be an accessory in some instances. It can be difficult to make a distinction between this form of corruption and some forms of extreme and loosely regulated [[lobbying]] where for instance law- or decision-makers can freely "sell" their vote, decision power or influence to those lobbyists who offer the highest compensation, including where for instance the latter act on behalf of powerful clients such as industrial groups who want to avoid the passing of specific environmental, social, or other regulations perceived as too stringent, etc. Where lobbying is (sufficiently) regulated, it becomes possible to provide for a distinctive criteria and to consider that trading in influence involves the use of "improper influence", as in article 12 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; of the [[Council of Europe]].

===Patronage===
{{Main|Patronage}}
[[Patronage]] refers to favoring supporters, for example with government employment. This may be legitimate, as when a newly elected government changes the top officials in the administration in order to effectively implement its policy. It can be seen as corruption if this means that incompetent persons, as a payment for supporting the regime, are selected before more able ones. In nondemocracies many government officials are often selected for loyalty rather than ability. They may be almost exclusively selected from a particular group (for example, [[Sunni]] Arabs in [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraq, the [[nomenklatura]] in the [[Soviet Union]], or the [[Junker]]s in [[Imperial Germany]]) that support the regime in return for such favors. A similar problem can also be seen in Eastern Europe, for example in [[Romania]], where the government is often accused of [[patronage]] (when a new government comes to power it rapidly changes most of the officials in the public sector).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher |first=Tom |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443792604577572910124653818 |title=The EU Can't Ignore Its Romania Problem |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- The above was replaced 2014-09-03 with the following reference to Pakistan.  This is unacceptable, because it is potentially libelous without a citation to a credible source.  I'm placing this comment here, because the edit was made anonymously, i.e., by an IP number -- and it was made it 2 steps, which meant that I couldn't just revert it.  If the author is invited to insert this change here again with an appropriate source but without destroying the reference to Romania.  It might be appropriate to add sections on both Romania and Pakistan to the Wikipedia article on "Patronage".  If that was done, it might be appropriate to delete the reference to Romania here, retaining the one to Pakistan -- provided it was supported by solid reference(s). // Addition deleted:  "[[Pakistan]], where the government is often accused of patronage ; namely Benazir, Zardari and Mian Nawaz Sharif are labeled corrupt politicians having numerous cases of corruption. Currently the Prime minister of Pakistan Mian Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shahbaz Sharif are accused of murder."  --&gt;

===Nepotism and cronyism===
{{Main|Nepotism|Cronyism}}
Favoring relatives ([[nepotism]]) or personal friends ([[cronyism]]) of an official is a form of illegitimate private gain. This may be combined with [[bribery]], for example demanding that a business should employ a [[kinship|relative]] of an official controlling regulations affecting the business. The most extreme example is when the entire state is inherited, as in [[North Korea]] or [[Syria]]. A lesser form might be in the Southern United States with [[Good ol' boy]]s, where women and minorities are excluded. A milder form of cronyism is an "[[old boy network]]", in which appointees to official positions are selected only from a closed and exclusive social network – such as the alumni of particular universities – instead of appointing the most competent candidate.

Seeking to harm enemies becomes corruption when official powers are illegitimately used as means to this end. For example, trumped-up charges are often brought up against journalists or writers who bring up politically sensitive issues, such as a politician's acceptance of bribes.

===Gombeenism and parochialism===
{{Main|Gombeen man|Parochialism}}
[[Gombeen man|Gombeenism]] refers to an individual who is dishonest and corrupt for the purpose of personal gain, more often through monetary, while, [[parochialism]] which is also known as parish pump politics relates to placing local or vanity projects ahead of the national interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R.

===Electoral fraud===
{{Main|Electoral fraud}}
'''Electoral fraud''' is illegal interference with the process of an [[election]]. Acts of [[fraud]] affect vote counts to bring about an election result, whether by increasing the vote share of the favored candidate, depressing the vote share of the rival candidates, or both. Also called '''voter fraud''', the mechanisms involved include illegal voter registration, intimidation at polls, voting computer [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]], and improper vote counting.

===Embezzlement===
{{Main|Embezzlement}}
[[Embezzlement]] is the theft of entrusted funds. It is political when it involves public money taken by a public official for use by anyone not specified by the public. A common type of embezzlement is that of personal use of entrusted government resources; for example, when an official assigns public employees to renovate his own house.

===Kickbacks===
{{main|Kickback (bribery)}}
{{see also|Anti-competitive practices|Bid rigging|Fraud|Charbonneau Commission}}
A [[Money trail|kickback]] is an official's share of misappropriated funds allocated from his or her organization to an organization involved in corrupt [[bidding]]. For example, suppose that a politician is in charge of choosing how to spend some public funds. He can give a [[contract]] to a [[General contractor|company]] that is not the best bidder, or allocate more than they deserve. In this case, the company benefits, and in exchange for betraying the public, the official receives a kickback payment, which is a portion of the sum the company received. This sum itself may be all or a portion of the difference between the actual (inflated) payment to the company and the (lower) market-based price that would have been paid had the bidding been competitive.

Another example of a kickback would be if a judge receives a portion of the profits that a business makes in exchange for his judicial decisions.

Kickbacks are not limited to government officials; any situation in which people are entrusted to spend funds that do not belong to them are susceptible to this kind of corruption.

===Unholy alliance===
{{Main|Unholy alliance (geopolitical)}}
An [[Unholy alliance (geopolitical)|unholy alliance]] is a coalition among seemingly antagonistic groups for [[ad hoc]] or hidden gain, generally some influential non-governmental group forming ties with political parties, supplying funding in exchange for the favorable treatment. Like patronage, unholy alliances are not necessarily illegal, but unlike patronage, by its deceptive nature and often great financial resources, an unholy alliance can be much more dangerous to the [[public interest]]. An early use of the term was by former US President [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt]]:

:"To destroy this invisible Government, to dissolve the '''unholy alliance''' between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day." – 1912 [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] Platform, attributed to Roosevelt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patricia O''Toole Sunday, Jun. 25, 2006 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1207791-2,00.html |title=O'Toole, Patricia, "The War of 1912," TIME in Partnership with CNN, Jun. 25, 2006 |publisher=Time.com |date=2006-06-25 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quoted again in his autobiography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/55/15b.html |title=Roosevelt, Theodore. ''An Autobiography:'' XV. The Peace of Righteousness, Appendix B, New York: Macmillan, 1913 |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he connects [[trust (19th century)|trusts]] and [[monopoly|monopolies]] (sugar interests, [[Standard Oil]], etc.) to [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Howard Taft]], and consequently both major [[political parties]].

===Involvement in organized crime===
An illustrative example of official involvement in [[organized crime]] can be found from 1920s and 1930s [[Shanghai]], where Huang Jinrong was a police chief in the [[French concession]], while simultaneously being a gang boss and co-operating with [[Du Yuesheng]], the [[Green Gang|local gang]] ringleader. The relationship kept the flow of profits from the gang's gambling dens, prostitution, and protection rackets undisturbed.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The United States accused [[Manuel Noriega]]'s government in [[Panama]] of being a "[[narcokleptocracy]]", a corrupt government profiting on [[illegal drug trade]]. Later the U.S. invaded Panama and captured Noriega.

==Conditions favorable for corruption==
It is argued that the following conditions are favorable for corruption:
* Information deficits
** Lacking [[freedom of information legislation]]. In contrast, for example: The Indian [[Right to Information Act]] 2005 is perceived to have "already engendered mass movements in the country that is bringing the lethargic, often corrupt bureaucracy to its knees and changing power equations completely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=52046 |title=AsiaMedia :: Right to Information Act India's magic wand against corruption |publisher=Asiamedia.ucla.edu |date=2006-08-31 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926172330/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=52046 |archivedate=2008-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Lack of investigative reporting in the local media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/investigative_journalists_as_anti_corruption_activists_interview_gerardo_re |title=Investigative journalists as anti-corruption activists: An interview with Gerardo Reyes |publisher=Transparency.org |date=2013-06-07 |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Contempt for or negligence of exercising [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]].
** Weak [[accounting]] practices, including lack of timely financial management.
** Lack of measurement of corruption. For example, using regular surveys of households and businesses in order to quantify the degree of perception of corruption in different parts of a nation or in different government institutions may increase awareness of corruption and create pressure to combat it. This will also enable an evaluation of the officials who are fighting corruption and the methods used.
** [[Tax haven]]s which tax their own citizens and companies but not those from other nations and refuse to disclose information necessary for foreign taxation. This enables large-scale political corruption in the foreign nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,,1994976,00.html |title=Western bankers and lawyers 'rob Africa of $150bn every year |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |date=2007-01-21 |accessdate=2009-12-05 | location=London | first=Nick | last=Mathiason}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
* Lacking control of the government.
** Lacking [[civic society]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s which monitor the government.
** An individual voter may have a [[rational ignorance]] regarding politics, especially in nationwide elections, since each vote has little weight.
** Weak [[civil service]], and slow pace of [[Civil service reform in developing countries|reform]].
** Weak [[rule of law]].
** Weak [[Lawyer|legal profession]].
** Weak [[judicial independence]].
** Lacking protection of [[whistleblower]]s.
*** [[Government Accountability Project]]
** Lack of [[benchmarking]], that is continual detailed evaluation of procedures and comparison to others who do similar things, in the same government or others, in particular comparison to those who do the best work. The Peruvian organization Ciudadanos al Dia has started to measure and compare transparency, costs, and efficiency in different government departments in Peru. It annually awards the best practices which has received widespread media attention. This has created competition among government agencies in order to improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/why_benchmarkin.html#more |title=Why benchmarking works – PSD Blog – World Bank Group |publisher=Psdblog.worldbank.org |date=2006-08-17 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920181947/http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/why_benchmarkin.html#more |archive-date=2009-09-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Individual officials routinely handle cash, instead of handling payments by [[giro]] or on a separate cash desk – illegitimate withdrawals from supervised bank accounts are much more difficult to conceal.
** Public funds are centralized rather than distributed. For example, if $1,000 is embezzled from a local agency that has $2,000 funds, it is easier to notice than from a national agency with $2,000,000 funds. See the [[subsidiarity|principle of subsidiarity]].
** Large, unsupervised public investments.
** Pay disproportionately lower than that of the average citizen. 
** Government licenses needed to conduct business, e.g., [[import license]]s, encourage bribing and kickbacks.
** Long-time work in the same position may create relationships inside and outside the government which encourage and help conceal corruption and favoritism. Rotating government officials to different positions and geographic areas may help prevent this; for instance certain high rank officials in French government services (e.g. [[Trésor public|treasurer-paymasters general]]) must rotate every few years.
** Costly [[political campaign]]s, with expenses exceeding normal sources of political funding, especially when funded with taxpayer money.
** A single group or family controlling most of the key government offices.  Lack of laws forbidding and limiting number of members of the same family to be in office .
** Less interaction with officials reduces the opportunities for corruption. For example, using the Internet for sending in required information, like applications and tax forms, and then processing this with automated computer systems. This may also speed up the processing and reduce unintentional human errors. See [[e-Government]].
** A windfall from exporting abundant natural resources may encourage corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaide.edu.au/cies/papers/0320.pdf |title=Resources for Sale: Corruption, Democracy and the Natural Resource Curse |format=PDF |last1=Damania |first1=Richard |first2=Erwin |last2=Bulte |date=July 2003 |publisher=Centre for International Economic Studies, University of Adelaide |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906123659/http://www.adelaide.edu.au/cies/papers/0320.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See [[Resource curse]])''
** [[War]] and other forms of conflict correlate with a breakdown of [[public security]].
* Social conditions
** Self-interested closed cliques and "[[old boy network]]s".
** Family-, and clan-centered social structure, with a tradition of [[nepotism]]/favouritism being acceptable.
** A [[gift economy]], such as the Soviet [[Blat (term)|blat]] system, emerges in a Communist [[centrally planned economy]].
** Lacking [[literacy]] and [[education]] among the population.
** Frequent [[discrimination]] and [[bullying]] among the population.
** Tribal solidarity, giving benefits to certain ethnic groups.  In India for example, the political system, it has become common that the leadership of national and regional parties are passed from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/soutikbiswas/2011/01/is_india_sliding_into_a.html |title=Is India sliding into a hereditary monarchy?|author=Soutik Biswas |date=2011-01-18 |work=BBC |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/column/the-gandhi-dynasty-politics-as-usual/20110805.htm|title=The Gandhi dynasty: Politics as usual|first1=Manjeet|last1=Deo|last2=Kripalani |date=2011-08-05 |work=Rediff|publisher=Rediff News|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** creating a system in which a family holds the center of power. Some examples are most of the Dravidian parties of south India and also the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]], which is one of the two major political parties in India.
** Lack of strong laws which forbid members of the same family to contest elections and be in office as in India where local elections are often contested between members of the same powerful family by standing in opposite parties so that whoever is elected that particular family is at tremendous benefit.

===Media===
[[q:Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson]] observed a tendency for "The functionaries of every government ... to command at will the liberty and property of their constituents.  There is no safe deposit [for liberty and property] ... without information. Where the press is free, and every man able to read, all is safe."

Recent research supports Jefferson's claim.  Brunetti and Weder found "evidence of a significant relationship between more press freedom and less corruption in a large cross-section of countries." They also presented "evidence which suggests that the direction of causation runs from higher press freedom to lower corruption."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Snyder and Strömberg found "that a poor fit between newspaper markets and political districts reduces press coverage of politics. ...

===Size of public sector===
Extensive and diverse public spending is, in itself, inherently at risk of cronyism, kickbacks, and embezzlement. Complicated regulations and arbitrary, unsupervised official conduct exacerbate the problem. This is one argument for [[privatization]] and [[deregulation]]. Opponents of privatization see the argument as ideological. The argument that corruption necessarily follows from the opportunity is weakened by the existence of countries with low to non-existent corruption but large public sectors, like the [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sachs110 |title=Lessons From the North|publisher=Project Syndicate |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries score high on the [[Ease of Doing Business Index]], due to good and often simple regulations and have [[rule of law]] firmly established. Therefore, due to their lack of corruption in the first place, they can run large public sectors without inducing political corruption. Recent evidence that takes both the size of expenditures and regulatory complexity into account has found that high-income democracies with more expansive state sectors do indeed have higher levels of corruption.&lt;ref name="www-wds.worldbank" /&gt;

Like other governmental economic activities, also privatization, such as in the sale of government-owned property, is particularly at the risk of cronyism. Privatizations in Russia, Latin America, and East Germany were accompanied by large-scale corruption during the sale of the state-owned companies. Those with political connections unfairly gained large wealth, which has discredited privatization in these regions. While media have reported widely the grand corruption that accompanied the sales, studies have argued that in addition to increased operating efficiency, daily petty corruption is, or would be, larger without privatization and that corruption is more prevalent in non-privatized sectors. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that extralegal and unofficial activities are more prevalent in countries that privatized less.&lt;ref&gt;Privatization in Competitive Sectors: The Record to Date. Sunita Kikeri and John Nellis. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 2860, June 2002. [http://www.econ.chula.ac.th/about/member/sothitorn/privatization.pdf Econ.Chula.ac.th] artimort.pdf IDEI.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325112620/http://www.econ.chula.ac.th/about/member/sothitorn/privatization.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, the principle of subsidiarity is applied: a government service should be provided by the lowest, most local authority that can competently provide it. An effect is that distribution of funds in multiple instances discourages embezzlement because even small sums missing will be noticed. In contrast, in a centralized authority, even minute proportions of public funds can be large sums of money.

==Governmental corruption==
If the highest echelons of the governments also take advantage of corruption or embezzlement from the state's treasury, it is sometimes referred to the [[neologism]] ''[[kleptocracy]]''. Members of the government can take advantage of the [[natural resource]]s (e.g., diamonds and oil in a few prominent cases) or state-owned productive industries. A number of corrupt governments have enriched themselves via foreign aid. Indeed, there is a positive correlation between aid flows and high levels of corruption within recipient countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Svensson |first=Jakob |year=2000 |title=Foreign Aid and Rent-Seeking |doi=10.1016/S0022-1996(99)00014-8 |journal=Journal of International Economics |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=437–461 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Alesina |first=Alberto |authorlink=Alberto Alesina |last2=Weder |first2=Beatrice |authorlink2=Beatrice Weder di Mauro |year=2002 |title=Do Corrupt Governments Receive less Foreign Aid? |doi=10.1257/00028280260344669 |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=92 |issue=4 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A corrupt [[dictatorship]] typically results in many years of general hardship and suffering for the vast majority of citizens as [[civil society]] and the [[rule of law]] disintegrate. In addition, corrupt dictators routinely ignore economic and [[society|social]] problems in their quest to amass ever more wealth and power.

The classic case of a corrupt, exploitive dictator often given is the regime of [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko]], who ruled the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (which he renamed [[Zaire]]) from 1965 to 1997. It is said that usage of the term [[kleptocracy]] gained popularity largely in response to a need to accurately describe Mobutu's regime. Another classic case is [[Nigeria]], especially under the rule of General [[Sani Abacha]] who was ''[[de facto]]'' president of Nigeria from 1993 until his death in 1998.  He is reputed to have stolen some [[US$]]3–4 billion.  He and his relatives are often mentioned in [[Advance-fee fraud|Nigerian 419 letter scams]] claiming to offer vast fortunes for "help" in laundering his stolen "fortunes", which in reality turn out not to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Who wants to be a millionaire? – An online collection of Nigerian scam mails&lt;/ref&gt; More than $400 billion was stolen from the treasury by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nigeria's corruption totals $400 billion |publisher=''[[Malaysia Today]]'' |date=June 27, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211033642/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2005/06/nigerias-corruption-totals-400-billion.htm |archivedate=2007-12-11|url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2005/06/nigerias-corruption-totals-400-billion.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, articles in various financial periodicals, most notably ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, have pointed to [[Fidel Castro]], General Secretary of the Republic of [[Cuba]] from 1959 until his death in 2016, of likely being the beneficiary of up to $900 million, based on "his control" of state-owned companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/2006-05-04-castro_x.htm |title=Fidel Castro net worth rises, according to 'Forbes' |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2006-05-04 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of his regime claim that he has used money amassed through weapons sales, narcotics, international loans, and confiscation of private property to enrich himself and his political cronies who hold his dictatorship together, and that the $900 million published by [[Forbes]] is merely a portion of his assets, although that needs to be proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shapiro |first=Ben |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BenShapiro/2006/08/02/the_death_of_fidel_castro |title=Ben Shapiro :: Townhall.com :: The death of Fidel Castro |publisher=Townhall.com |date=2006-08-05 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judiciary corruption==
There are two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private. [[Budget]] of the judiciary in many transitional and [[developing countries]] is almost completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject of the [[constitutional economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Peter |last=Barenboim |title= Defining the rules |publisher= The European Lawyer |volume= Issue 90 |date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judicial corruption]] can be difficult to completely eradicate, even in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pahis|first1=Stratos|title=Corruption in Our Courts: What It Looks Like and Where It Is Hidden|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=2009|volume=118|accessdate=1 August 2015|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/corruption-in-our-courts-what-it-looks-like-and-where-it-is-hidden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mobile telecommunications]] and [[radio broadcasting]] help to fight corruption, especially in developing regions like [[Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voicesfromemergingmarkets.com/?p=19 |title=Mobile Phones and Radios Combat Corruption in Burundi – Voices from Emerging Markets |publisher=Voicesfromemergingmarkets.com |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630142547/http://voicesfromemergingmarkets.com/?p=19 |archivedate=2009-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where other forms of [[communication]]s are limited.
In India, the anti-corruption bureau fights against corruption, and a new ombudsman bill called [[Jan Lokpal Bill]] is being prepared.

In the 1990s, initiatives were taken at an international level (in particular by the [[European Community]], the [[Council of Europe]], the [[OECD]]) to put a ban on corruption: in 1996, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/cm/Home_en.asp |title=Committee of Ministers – Home |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, adopted a comprehensive Programme of Action against Corruption and, subsequently, issued a series of anti-corruption standard-setting instruments:
* the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173);&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
* the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174);&lt;ref name="conventions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=174&amp;CM=1&amp;DF=7/18/2008&amp;CL=ENG |title=Criminal Law Convention on Corruption: CETS No. 174 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Additional Protocol to the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 191);&lt;ref name="conventions_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=191&amp;CM=1&amp;DF=7/18/2008&amp;CL=ENG |title=Additional Protocol to the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption: CETS No. 191 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Twenty Guiding Principles for the Fight against Corruption (Resolution (97) 24);&lt;ref name="coe.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/documents/Resolution(97)24_EN.pdf |title=Council of Europe: Resolution (97) 24: On the Twenty Guiding Principles for the Fight Against Corruption |publisher=Coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Recommendation on Codes of Conduct for Public Officials (Recommendation No. R (2000) 10);&lt;ref name="Rec 2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/documents/Rec(2000)10_EN.pdf |title=Recommendation No. R (2000) 10 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on Codes of Conduct for Public Officials |publisher=Coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Recommendation on Common Rules against Corruption in the Funding of Political Parties and Electoral Campaigns (Rec(2003)4)&lt;ref name="Rec 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/general/Rec(2003)4_EN.pdf |title=Recommendation No. R (2003) 4 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on Common Rules against Corruption |publisher=Coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of these instruments was to address the various forms of corruption (involving the public sector, the private sector, the financing of political activities, etc.) whether they had a strictly domestic or also a transnational dimension. To monitor the implementation at national level of the requirements and principles provided in those texts, a monitoring mechanism – the [[Group of States Against Corruption]] (also known as GRECO) (French: Groupe d'Etats contre la corruption) was created.

Further conventions were adopted at the regional level under the aegis of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS or OEA), the [[African Union]], and in 2003, at the universal level under that of the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]].

==Whistleblowers==&lt;!-- dummy edit to identify attribution ; can be deleted. --&gt;

{{Main|Whistleblower}}
A whistleblower (also written as whistle-blower or whistle blower) is a person who exposes any kind of information or activity that is deemed illegal, unethical, or not correct within an organization that is either private or public. The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways: violation of company policy/rules, law, regulation, or threat to public interest/national security, as well as fraud, and corruption. Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to the surface either internally or externally. Internally, a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor. Externally, a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media, government, law enforcement, or those who are concerned. Whistleblowers, however, take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing.

Because of this, a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers. Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers, but that protection can only go so far. Whistleblowers face legal action, criminal charges, social stigma, and termination from any position, office, or job. Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public. The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on private sector, or public sector. Depending on many factors, both can have varying results. However, whistleblowing in the public sector organization is more likely to result in criminal charges and possible custodial sentences. A whistleblower who chooses to accuse a private sector organization or agency is more likely to face termination and legal and civil charges.

Deeper questions and theories of whistleblowing and why people choose to do so can be studied through an ethical approach. Whistleblowing is a topic of ongoing ethical debate. Leading arguments in the ideological camp that whistleblowing is ethical to maintain that whistleblowing is a form of civil disobedience, and aims to protect the public from government wrongdoing. In the opposite camp, some see whistleblowing as unethical for breaching confidentiality, especially in industries that handle sensitive client or patient information. Legal protection can also be granted to protect whistleblowers, but that protection is subject to many stipulations. Hundreds of laws grant protection to whistleblowers, but stipulations can easily cloud that protection and leave whistleblowers vulnerable to retaliation and legal trouble. However, the decision and action have become far more complicated with recent advancements in technology and communication. Whistleblowers frequently face reprisal, sometimes at the hands of the organization or group they have accused, sometimes from related organizations, and sometimes under law. Questions about the legitimacy of whistleblowing, the moral responsibility of whistleblowing, and the appraisal of the institutions of whistleblowing are part of the field of political ethics.

==Measuring corruption==
Measuring corruption accurately is difficult if not impossible due to the illicit nature of the transaction and imprecise definitions of corruption.&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |title=A Users' Guide to Measuring Corruption |publisher=[[Global Integrity]] |date=September 5, 2008 |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131012755/http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Few reliable measures of the magnitude of corruption exists and among those, there is a high level of heterogeneity. One of the most common ways to estimate corruption is through perception surveys. They have the advantage of good coverage, however, they do not measure corruption precisely.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olken|first=Benjamin A.|last2=Pande|first2=Rohini|date=|title=Corruption in Developing Countries|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/73081/1/Olken_Corruption%20in.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Economics|volume=4|pages=479–509|doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080511-110917}}&lt;/ref&gt; While "corruption" indices first appeared in 1995 with the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] CPI, all of these metrics address different proxies for corruption, such as public perceptions of the extent of the problem.&lt;ref name="Galtung, Fredrik 2006"&gt;Galtung, Fredrik (2006). "Measuring the Immeasurable: Boundaries and Functions of (Macro) Corruption Indices," in Measuring Corruption, Charles Sampford, Arthur Shacklock, Carmel Connors, and Fredrik Galtung, Eds. (Ashgate): 101–130.&lt;/ref&gt; However, over time the refinement of methods and validation checks against objective indicators has meant that, while not perfect, many of these indicators are getting better at consistently and validly measuring the scale of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/113281515516828746/pdf/WPS8299.pdf |title= Can We Measure the Power of the Grabbing Hand? A Comparative Analysis of Different Indicators of Corruption|last=Hamilton|first= Alexander|date=2017|website=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transparency International]], an anti-corruption [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]], pioneered this field with the CPI, first released in 1995. This work is often credited with breaking a taboo and forcing the issue of corruption into high-level development policy discourse. Transparency International currently publishes three measures, updated annually: a CPI (based on aggregating third-party polling of public perceptions of how corrupt different countries are); a Global Corruption Barometer (based on a survey of general public attitudes toward and experience of corruption); and a [[Bribe Payers Index]], looking at the willingness of foreign firms to pay bribes. The Corruption Perceptions Index is the best known of these metrics, though it has drawn much criticism&lt;ref name="Galtung, Fredrik 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sik |first=Endre |year=2002 |chapter=The Bad, the Worse and the Worst: Guesstimating the Level of Corruption |title=Political Corruption in Transition: A Skeptic's Handbook |editor-first=Stephen |editor-last=Kotkin |editor2-first=Andras |editor2-last=Sajo |location=Budapest |publisher=Central European University Press |pages=91–113 |isbn=963-9241-46-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, Christiane and Charles Oman (2006).

This index evaluates the risk of corruption in countries' military sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transparency is feasible |author=Mark Pyman |publisher=dandc.eu |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/transparency-international-assesses-82-governments-defence-related-corruption-risks-first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank collects a range of data on corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/governance/data/ |title=WBI Governance &amp; Anti-Corruption – Data |publisher=Worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; including survey responses from over 100,000 firms worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/Data/ExploreTopics/corruption |title=Corruption – World Bank Survey of Business Managers |publisher=Enterprisesurveys.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a set of indicators of governance and institutional quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.worldbank.org/IU54LJVHT0 |title=Public Sector Governance – Indicators of Governance &amp; Institutional Quality |publisher=Go.worldbank.org |date=2009-12-30 |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, one of the six dimensions of governance measured by the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] is Control of Corruption, which is defined as "the extent to which power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as 'capture' of the state by [[elite]]s and private interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance |year=2007 |publisher=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, The World Bank |page=3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527211855/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the definition itself is fairly precise, the data aggregated into the Worldwide Governance Indicators is based on any available polling: questions range from "is corruption a serious problem?" to measures of public access to information, and not consistent across countries. Despite these weaknesses, the global coverage of these datasets has led to their widespread adoption, most notably by the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]].&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"/&gt;

A number of parties have collected survey data, from the public and from experts, to try and gauge the level of corruption and bribery, as well as its impact on political and economic outcomes.&lt;ref name="bath.ac.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton, A 2014"/&gt;
A second wave of corruption metrics has been created by [[Global Integrity]], the International Budget Partnership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalbudget.org|title=Home - International Budget Partnership|website=International Budget Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many lesser known local groups. These metrics include the [[Global Integrity Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://report.globalintegrity.org/ |title=The Global Integrity Report &amp;#124; Global Integrity |publisher=Report.globalintegrity.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308204055/http://report.globalintegrity.org/ |archivedate=2008-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; first published in 2004. These second wave projects aim to create policy change by identifying resources more effectively and creating checklists toward incremental reform. Global Integrity and the International Budget Partnership&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalbudget.org/ |title=International Budget Partnership |publisher=Internationalbudget.org |date=2012-05-28 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; each dispense with public surveys and instead uses in-country experts to evaluate "the opposite of corruption" – which Global Integrity defines as the public policies that prevent, discourage, or expose corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://report.globalintegrity.org/methodology/whitepaper.cfm |title=The Global Integrity Report: 2009 Methodology White Paper |publisher=[[Global Integrity]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307194427/http://report.globalintegrity.org/methodology/whitepaper.cfm |archivedate=2011-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches compliment the first wave, awareness-raising tools by giving governments facing public outcry a checklist which measures concrete steps toward improved governance.&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"/&gt;

Typical second wave corruption metrics do not offer the worldwide coverage found in first wave projects and instead focus on localizing information gathered to specific problems and creating deep, "unpackable"{{clarify|date=December 2014}} content that matches quantitative and qualitative data.

Alternative approaches, such as the British aid agency's Drivers of Change research, skips numbers and promotes understanding corruption via political economy analysis of who controls power in a given society.&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"/&gt;

==Institutions dealing with political corruption==
* [[Global Witness]], an international NGO established in 1993 that works to break the links between natural resource exploitation, conflict, poverty, corruption, and human rights abuses worldwide
* [[Group of States Against Corruption]], a body established under the Council of Europe to monitor the implementation of instruments adopted by member states to combat political corruption
* [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (disambiguation)]]
* [[International Anti-Corruption Academy]]
* [[The Sovereign American Commission for Political Corruption Accountability (SACPCA)]] was originally a subsidiary of the non-profit organization, 'the U.S. Civil Rights Enforcement Authority (USCREA),' and formed in March 2017 to investigate a number of anonymous emails USCREA had then received related to President Trump's unexpected removal of Preet Bharara as Assistant U.S. Attorney (Southern District of New York).  SACPCA was restructured in July 2017 as a public benefit corporation having the corporate purpose of "identifying, investigating &amp; prosecuting politically corrupt practices," and presently operates under a legal mandate whereby the identities of its shareholders and directors are kept strictly confidential. &lt;http://sacpca.ltd{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8578">{{Thomism}}{{Abortion in the Catholic Church}}The '''principle of double effect'''—also known as the '''rule of double effect'''; the '''doctrine of double effect''', often abbreviated as '''DDE''' or '''PDE''', '''double-effect reasoning'''; or simply '''double effect'''—is a set of ethical criteria which Christian philosophers, and some others, have advocated for evaluating the permissibility of acting when one's otherwise legitimate act (for example, relieving a terminally ill patient's pain) may also cause an effect one would otherwise be obliged to avoid (sedation and a slightly shortened life). The first known example of double-effect reasoning is [[Thomas Aquinas]]' treatment of homicidal self-defense, in his work ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3064.htm#article7 ''Summa Theologiae, IIa-IIae Q. 64, art. 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

This set of criteria states that an action having foreseen harmful effects practically inseparable from the good effect is justifiable if the following are true:
* the nature of the act is itself good, or at least morally neutral;
* the agent intends the good effect and does not intend the bad effect either as a means to the good or as an end in itself;
* the good effect outweighs the bad effect in circumstances sufficiently grave to justify causing the bad effect and the agent exercises due diligence to minimize the harm.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Cavanaugh, ''Double-Effect Reasoning: Doing Good and Avoiding Evil'', p.36, Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intentional harm versus side effects==
The principle of double effect is based on the idea that there is a morally relevant difference between an "intended" consequence of an act and one that is foreseen by the actor but not calculated to achieve his motive. So, for example, the principle is invoked to consider the terror bombing of non-combatants having as its goal victory in a legitimate war morally out of bounds, while holding as ethically in bounds an act of strategic bombing that similarly harms non-combatants with foresight  as a side effect of destroying a legitimate military target. Because advocates of double effect propose that consequentially similar acts can be morally different, double effect is most often criticized by [[consequentialism|consequentialists]] who consider the consequences of actions entirely determinative of the action's morality.

In their use of the distinction between intent and foresight without intent, advocates of double effect make three arguments. First, that intent differs from foresight, even in cases in which one foresees an effect as inevitable. Second, that one can apply the distinction to specific sets of cases found in military ethics (terror bombing/strategic bombing), medical ethics (craniotomy/hysterectomy), and social ethics (euthanasia). Third, that the distinction has moral relevance, importance, or significance.

The doctrine consists of four conditions that must be satisfied before an act is morally permissible:

# The ''nature-of-the-act condition.'' The action must be either morally good or indifferent.
# The ''means-end condition.'' The bad effect must not be the means by which one achieves the good effect.
# The ''right-intention condition.'' The intention must be the achieving of only the good effect, with the bad effect being only an unintended side effect.
# The ''proportionality condition.'' The bad effect must not be disproportionate to the good effect.

The second of these four conditions is an application of the more general principle that good ends do not justify evil means.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Timmons, ''Moral Theory: An Introduction'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-8476-9768-7}}), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Medicine===
The principle of double effect is frequently cited in cases of [[pregnancy]] and [[abortion]]. A doctor who believes abortion is always morally wrong may still remove the uterus or [[Fallopian tube|fallopian tubes]] of a pregnant woman, knowing the procedure will cause the death of the [[embryo]] or [[fetus]], in cases in which the woman is certain to die without the procedure (examples cited include aggressive [[uterus|uterine]] [[cancer]] and [[ectopic pregnancy]]). In these cases, the intended effect is to save the woman's life, not to terminate the pregnancy, and the effect of not performing the procedure would result in the greater evil of the death of both the mother and the foetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | title = Doctrine of Double Effect | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/double-effect/ | editor = Edward N.

In cases of terminally ill patients who would hasten their deaths because of unbearable pain, or whose caregivers would do so for them ([[euthanasia]], [[medical aid in dying]], etc.), a principle of "double effect death" could be applied to justify the deliberate administration of a pain-killer in potentially unsafe doses—not in an attempt to end life but the pain suffered is considered harmful to the patient. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has voiced support for this principle in its deliberations over the constitutionality of medical aid in dying.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vacco v. Quill]]'' and ''[[Washington v. Glucksberg]]'', both in 1997. See: Tucker, Kathryn E., “Legal Advocacy to Improved Care and Expand Options at the End of Life,” in ''Physician-Assisted Dying: The Case for Palliative Care &amp; Patient Choice'', edited by T.E. Quill and M.P. Battin ([[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2004). The Court made it clear that a “medical death” hastened by palliative measures was permissible.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

[[Consequentialism|Consequentialists]], in particular, reject the notion that two acts can differ in their moral permissibility if both have exactly the same consequences, or expected consequences. [[John Stuart Mill]], a nineteenth-century advocate of the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] version of consequentialism, argues that it is a mistake to confuse the standards for right action with a consideration of our motives to perform a right action: "He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble; he who betrays the friend that trusts him, is guilty of a crime, even if his object be to serve another friend to whom he is under greater obligations." According to Mill, scrutiny of motives will show that almost all good behavior proceeds from questionable intentions. Therefore, Mill argues, our moral analysis should ignore matters of motivation, and so we should reject DDE, which appeals to a distinction between intended and [[unintended consequences]].&lt;ref name="JSM"&gt;John Stuart Mill, ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]'' (London: Parker, Son and Bourn, 1863), page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill further claims that scrutiny of motives will reveal a man's character, but utilitarianism does not judge character, only the rightness or wrongness of actions.

{{Anthropology}}

A '''race''' is a grouping of [[human]]s based on shared physical or social qualities into categories generally viewed as distinct by society.{{refn|name=Barnshaw}} First used to refer to speakers of a common [[language]] and then to denote [[nation]]al affiliations, by the 17th century the term ''race'' began to refer to physical ([[phenotypical]]) traits. Modern scholarship regards race as a [[social construct]], that is, a symbolic identity created to establish some cultural meaning. While partially based on physical similarities within groups, race is not an inherent physical or biological quality.{{refn|name=Barnshaw}}{{refn|name=Britannica}}

Social conceptions and [[Racial grouping|groupings of races]] vary over time, involving [[Folk taxonomy|folk taxonomies]]&lt;ref name="montagu"&gt;See:
* {{harvnb|Montagu|1962}}
* {{harvnb|Bamshad|Olson|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; that define [[Wikt:essentiality|essential types]] of individuals based on perceived traits. Scientists consider biological [[essentialism]] obsolete,&lt;ref name="Sober" /&gt; and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits.&lt;ref name="Lee, Mountain; et al. 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Keita2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keita |last2=Kittles |first2=R A | title=Conceptualizing human variation |journal=Nature Genetics|date=2004|volume=36|issue=11s|pages=S17–S20|doi=10.1038/ng1455|url= http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v36/n11s/box/ng1455_BX1.html|quote=Modern human biological variation is not structured into phylogenetic subspecies ('races'), nor are the taxa of the standard anthropological 'racial' classifications breeding populations.

The clinal, gradually changing nature of geographic genetic difference is complicated further by the migration and mixing that human groups have engaged in since prehistory. Human beings do not fit the zoological definition of race. A mountain of evidence assembled by historians, anthropologists, and biologists proves that race is not and cannot be a natural division of human beings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though there is a broad scientific agreement that essentialist and typological conceptualizations of race are untenable, scientists around the world continue to conceptualize race in widely differing ways, some of which have essentialist implications.&lt;ref name="nih10" /&gt; While some researchers use the concept of race to make distinctions among [[fuzzy set]]s of traits or observable differences in behaviour, others in the [[scientific community]] suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive&lt;ref name="Lee, Mountain; et al. 2008" /&gt; or simplistic way,&lt;ref name="Graves 2001" /&gt; and argue that, among humans, race has no taxonomic significance by pointing out that all living humans belong to the same [[species]], [[human|''Homo sapiens'']], and (as far as applicable) [[human subspecies|subspecies]], ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]''.&lt;ref name="Keita2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AAPA" /&gt;

Since the second half of the 20th century, the association of race with the ideologies and theories of [[scientific racism]] has led to the use of the word ''race'' itself becoming problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/08/opinion/sunday/should-medicine-discard-race.html|title=Opinion {{!}} What Doctors Should Ignore|date=8 December 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although still used in general contexts, ''race'' has often been replaced by less ambiguous and [[Loaded language|loaded]] terms: ''[[populations]]'', ''[[people]](s)'', ''[[ethnic groups]]'', or ''[[communities]]'', depending on context.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dict. race2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/race--2|title=Race&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=5 October 2012|quote='''1.'''

==Defining race==

Modern scholarship views racial categories as [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]], that is, race is not intrinsic to human beings but rather an [[Identity (social science)|identity]] created, often by socially dominant groups, to establish meaning in a social context. This often involves the subjugation of groups defined as racially inferior, as in the [[one-drop rule]] used in the 19th-century United States to exclude those with any amount of African ancestry from the dominant racial grouping, defined as "[[White people|white]]".&lt;ref name="Barnshaw"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnshaw |first=John |editor-last=Schaefer |editor-first=Richard T. |title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society, Volume 1 |date=2008 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-45-226586-5 |pages=1091–3 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMUola6pDnkC&amp;pg=PT1217&amp;dq=race+social+construction |chapter=Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such racial identities reflect the cultural attitudes of imperial powers dominant during the age of [[History of colonialism|European colonial expansion]].{{refn|name=Britannica}} This view rejects the notion that race is [[biologically]] defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marks |first=Jonathan |title=What it means to be 98% chimpanzee apes, people, and their genes |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |date=2003 |isbn=9780520930766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Templeton |first1=A.

Although commonalities in physical traits such as facial features, skin color, and hair texture comprise part of the race concept, the latter is a social distinction rather than an inherently biological one.{{refn|name=Barnshaw}} Other dimensions of racial groupings include shared history, traditions and language. For instance, [[African-American English]] is a language spoken by many [[African Americans]], especially in areas of the United States where racial segregation exists. Furthermore, people often self-identify as members of a race for political reasons.{{refn|name=Barnshaw}}

When people define and talk about a particular conception of race, they create a [[social reality]] through which social categorization is achieved.&lt;ref name="Lee 1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, races are said to be social constructs.&lt;ref name="Blank; Smaje"&gt;See:
* {{harvnb|Blank|Dabady|Citro|2004}}
* {{harvnb|Smaje|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; These constructs develop within various legal, economic, and [[sociopolitical]] contexts, and may be the effect, rather than the cause, of major social situations.&lt;ref name="Lee; Nobles; Morgan"&gt;See:
* {{harvnb|Lee|1997}}
* {{harvnb|Nobles|2000}}
* {{harvnb|Morgan|1975}} as cited in {{harvnb|Lee|1997|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; While race is understood to be a social construct by many, most scholars agree that race has real material effects in the lives of people through [[Institutionalization|institutionalized]] practices of preference and [[discrimination]].

Socioeconomic factors, in combination with early but enduring views of race, have led to considerable suffering within disadvantaged racial groups.&lt;ref name="Morgan; Smedley; et al." /&gt; [[Racial discrimination]] often coincides with racist mindsets, whereby the individuals and ideologies of one group come to perceive the members of an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] as both racially defined and morally inferior.&lt;ref name="Lee 1997, citing M&amp;A" /&gt; As a result, racial groups possessing relatively little power often find themselves excluded or oppressed, while [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] individuals and [[institution]]s are charged with holding racist attitudes.&lt;ref name="sivanandan" /&gt; Racism has led to many instances of tragedy, including [[slavery]] and [[genocide]].&lt;ref name="owens" /&gt;

In some countries, [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] uses race to [[Offender profiling|profile]] suspects. This use of racial categories is frequently criticized for perpetuating an outmoded understanding of human biological variation, and promoting stereotypes. Because in some societies racial groupings correspond closely with patterns of [[social stratification]], for [[social scientists]] studying social inequality, race can be a significant [[Dependent and independent variables|variable]]. As [[Sociology|sociological]] factors, racial categories may in part reflect [[Subjectivity|subjective]] attributions, [[Self-identity|self-identities]], and social institutions.&lt;ref name="King 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="schaefer" /&gt;

Scholars continue to debate the degrees to which racial categories are biologically warranted and socially constructed.&lt;ref name="Brace; Gill; Lee" /&gt; For example, in 2008, John Hartigan, Jr. argued for a view of race that focused primarily on culture, but which does not ignore the potential relevance of biology or genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hartigan|first1=John|title=Is Race Still Socially Constructed? The Recent Controversy over Race and Medical Genetics|journal=Science as Culture|date=June 2008|volume=17|issue=2|pages=163–193|doi=10.1080/09505430802062943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the racial [[paradigm]]s employed in different disciplines vary in their emphasis on [[Biological reductionism|biological reduction]] as contrasted with societal construction.

In the social sciences, theoretical frameworks such as [[racial formation theory]] and [[critical race theory]] investigate implications of race as social construction by exploring how the images, ideas and assumptions of race are expressed in everyday life. A large body of scholarship has traced the relationships between the historical, social production of race in legal and criminal language, and their effects on the policing and disproportionate incarceration of certain groups.

Groups of humans have always identified themselves as distinct from neighboring groups, but such differences have not always been understood to be natural, immutable and global. These features are the distinguishing features of how the concept of race is used today. In this way the idea of race as we understand it today came about during the historical process of exploration and conquest which brought Europeans into contact with groups from different continents, and of the ideology of classification and typology found in the natural sciences.&lt;ref name="Marks 2008" /&gt;  The term ''race'' was often used in a general [[Race (biology)|biological taxonomic sense]],&lt;ref name="Oxford Dict. race2" /&gt; starting from the 19th century, to denote [[Genetic divergence|genetically differentiated]] human [[population]]s defined by phenotype.&lt;ref name="Lie; Thompson; et al." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Keita1"/&gt;

===Colonialism===
According to Smedley and Marks the European concept of "race", along with many of the ideas now associated with the term, arose at the time of the [[scientific revolution]], which introduced and privileged the study of [[natural kind]]s, and the age of [[European imperialism]] and [[colonization]] which established political relations between Europeans and peoples with distinct cultural and political [[traditions]].&lt;ref name="Marks 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smedley 1999" /&gt; As Europeans encountered people from different parts of the [[world]], they speculated about the physical, social, and cultural differences among various human groups. The rise of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], which gradually displaced an earlier [[slave trade|trade in slaves]] from throughout the world, created a further [[incentive]] to categorize human groups in order to justify the subordination of African [[slave]]s.&lt;ref name="meltzer" /&gt;

Drawing on sources from [[classical antiquity]] and upon their own internal interactions&amp;nbsp;– for example, the hostility between the [[English people|English]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] powerfully influenced early European thinking about the differences between people&lt;ref name="takaki" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– Europeans began to sort themselves and others into groups based on physical appearance, and to attribute to individuals belonging to these groups behaviors and capacities which were claimed to be deeply ingrained. A set of [[folk belief]]s took hold that linked inherited physical differences between groups to [[Race and intelligence|inherited intellectual]], [[behavioral]], and [[moral]] qualities.&lt;ref name="banton" /&gt; Similar ideas can be found in other cultures,&lt;ref name="Lewis; Dikötter" /&gt; for example in [[China]], where a concept often translated as "race" was associated with supposed common descent from the [[Yellow Emperor]], and used to stress the unity of ethnic groups in China. Brutal conflicts between ethnic groups have existed throughout history and across the world.&lt;ref name="REGWG" /&gt;

===Early taxonomic models===
The first post-[[Graeco-Roman]] published classification of humans into distinct races seems to be [[François Bernier]]'s ''Nouvelle division de la terre par les différents espèces ou races qui l'habitent'' ("New division of Earth by the different species or races which inhabit it"), published in 1684.&lt;ref name="todorov" /&gt;  In the 18th century the differences among human groups became a focus of scientific investigation. But the scientific classification of phenotypic variation was frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate predispositions of different groups, always attributing the most desirable features to the White, European race and arranging the other races along a continuum of progressively undesirable attributes. The 1735 classification of [[Carl Linnaeus]], inventor of zoological taxonomy, divided the human species ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' into continental varieties of ''europaeus'', ''asiaticus'', ''americanus'', and ''afer'', each associated with a different [[humorism|humour]]: [[sanguine]], [[Melancholia|melancholic]], [[choleric]], and [[phlegmatic]], respectively.&lt;ref name="brace2" /&gt;{{sfn|Slotkin|1965|page=177}} ''Homo sapiens europaeus'' was described as active, acute, and adventurous, whereas ''Homo sapiens afer'' was said to be crafty, lazy, and careless.&lt;ref name="Graves 2001 p. 39" /&gt;

The 1775 treatise "The Natural Varieties of Mankind", by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] proposed five major divisions: the [[Caucasoid race]], the [[Mongoloid race]], the Ethiopian race (later termed ''[[Negroid]]''), the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian race]], and the [[Malayan race]], but he did not propose any hierarchy among the races.&lt;ref name="Graves 2001 p. 39" /&gt;  Blumenbach also noted the graded transition in appearances from one group to adjacent groups and suggested that "one variety of mankind does so sensibly pass into the other, that you cannot mark out the limits between them".&lt;ref name="Marks 1995" /&gt;

From the 17th through 19th centuries, the merging of folk beliefs about group differences with scientific explanations of those differences produced what Smedley has called an "[[ideology]] of race".&lt;ref name="Smedley 1999" /&gt; According to this ideology, races are primordial, natural, enduring and distinct. It was further argued that some groups may be the result of mixture between formerly distinct populations, but that careful study could distinguish the ancestral races that had combined to produce admixed groups.&lt;ref name="REGWG" /&gt; Subsequent influential classifications by [[Georges Buffon]], [[Petrus Camper]] and [[Christoph Meiners]] all classified "Negros" as inferior to Europeans.&lt;ref name="Graves 2001 p. 39" /&gt; In the [[United States]] the racial theories of [[Thomas Jefferson]] were influential. He saw Africans as inferior to Whites especially in regards to their intellect, and imbued with unnatural sexual appetites, but described [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] as equals to whites.&lt;ref name="Graves 2001 pp. 43–43" /&gt;

===Polygenism vs monogenism===
In the last two decades of the 18th century, the theory of [[polygenism]], the belief that different races had evolved separately in each continent and shared no common ancestor,&lt;ref name="stocking" /&gt; was advocated in England by historian [[Edward Long]] and anatomist [[Charles White (physician)|Charles White]], in [[Germany]] by ethnographers [[Christoph Meiners]] and [[Georg Forster]], and in [[France]] by [[Julien-Joseph Virey]]. In the US, [[Samuel George Morton]], [[Josiah Nott]] and [[Louis Agassiz]] promoted this theory in the mid-nineteenth century. Polygenism was popular and most widespread in the 19th century, culminating in the founding of the [[Anthropological Society of London]] (1863), which, during the period of the American Civil War, broke away from the [[Ethnological Society of London]] and its [[monogenism|monogenic stance]], their underlined difference lying, relevantly, in the so-called "Negro question": a substantial racist view by the former,{{r|Hunt1863_3}} and a more liberal view on race by the latter.{{r|Desmond09_332}}

===Models of human evolution===
{{See also|Multiregional hypothesis|Recent single origin hypothesis}}

Today, all [[humans]] are classified as belonging to the species ''Homo sapiens''. However, this is not the first species of [[homininae]]: the first species of genus ''Homo'', ''[[Homo habilis]]'', evolved in East Africa at least 2 million years ago, and members of this species populated different parts of Africa in a relatively short time. ''[[Homo erectus]]'' evolved more than 1.8 million years ago, and by 1.5 million years ago had spread throughout Europe and Asia. Virtually all [[physical anthropologist]]s agree that ''[[Anatomically modern human|Archaic Homo sapiens]]'' (A group including the possible species ''[[Homo heidelbergensis|H. heidelbergensis]]'', ''H. rhodesiensis'' and ''H. neanderthalensis'') evolved out of African ''Homo erectus'' (''sensu lato'') or ''[[Homo ergaster]].''&lt;ref&gt;Camilo J.

Fifth edition. p. 159. Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists support the idea that [[anatomically modern humans]] (''Homo sapiens'') evolved in North or East Africa from an [[archaic human]] species such as ''H. heidelbergensis'' and then migrated out of Africa, mixing with and replacing ''H. heidelbergensis'' and ''H. neanderthalensis'' populations throughout Europe and Asia, and ''H. rhodesiensis'' populations in Sub-Saharan Africa (a combination of the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa]] and [[Multiregional origin of modern humans|Multiregional]] models).&lt;ref name="StringerSurvivors"&gt;{{Cite book |date=2012 |first=Chris |last=Stringer |title=Lone Survivors: How We Came to Be the Only Humans on Earth |place=London |publisher=Times Books |isbn=978-0805088915 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=January 2013}}

===Biological classification===
{{further|Race (biology)|Species|Subspecies|Systematics|Phylogenetics|Cladistics}}
In the early 20th century, many [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] taught that race was an entirely biologically phenomenon and that this was core to a person's behavior and identity, a position commonly called [[racial essentialism]].&lt;ref name="cravens" /&gt;  This, coupled with a belief that [[linguistics|linguistic]], cultural, and social groups fundamentally existed along racial lines, formed the basis of what is now called [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref name="currell" /&gt; After the [[Nazi eugenics]] program, along with the rise of anti-colonial movements, racial essentialism lost widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirschman|first=Charles|date=2004|title=The Origins and Demise of the Concept of Race|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2004.00021.x/abstract|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=30|issue=3|pages=385–415|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2004.00021.x|issn=1728-4457|accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; New studies of [[culture]] and the fledgling field of [[population genetics]] undermined the scientific standing of racial essentialism, leading race anthropologists to revise their conclusions about the sources of phenotypic variation.&lt;ref name="cravens" /&gt; A significant number of modern anthropologists and [[biology|biologists]] in the West came to view race as an invalid genetic or biological designation.&lt;ref name="Cravens; Angier; et al." /&gt;

The first to challenge the concept of race on empirical grounds were the [[anthropology|anthropologists]] [[Franz Boas]], who provided evidence of phenotypic plasticity due to environmental factors,&lt;ref name="Smedley; Boas" /&gt; and [[Ashley Montagu]], who relied on evidence from genetics.&lt;ref name="Marks; Montagu" /&gt; [[E. O. Wilson]] then challenged the concept from the perspective of general animal systematics, and further rejected the claim that "races" were equivalent to "subspecies".&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt;

[[Human genetic variation]] is predominantly within races, continuous, and complex in structure, which is inconsistent with the concept of genetic human races.&lt;ref name=goodman&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodman|first=A. H.|date=November 2000|title=Why genes don't count (for racial differences in health)|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=90|issue=11|pages=1699–1702|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1446406|pmid=11076233|doi=10.2105/ajph.90.11.1699}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jonathan Marks,&lt;ref name="Marks 2008" /&gt;

{{quote|By the 1970s, it had become clear that (1) most human differences were cultural; (2) what was not cultural was principally polymorphic&amp;nbsp;– that is to say, found in diverse groups of people at different frequencies; (3) what was not cultural or polymorphic was principally clinal&amp;nbsp;– that is to say, gradually variable over geography; and (4) what was left&amp;nbsp;– the component of human diversity that was not cultural, polymorphic, or clinal&amp;nbsp;-was very small.

A consensus consequently developed among anthropologists and geneticists that race as the previous generation had known it&amp;nbsp;– as largely discrete, geographically distinct, gene pools&amp;nbsp;– did not exist.
}}

==== Subspecies ====
[[Race (biology)|The term ''race'' in biology]] is used with caution because it can be ambiguous. Generally, when it is used it is effectively a synonym of ''[[subspecies]]''.&lt;ref name="Keita; Templeton; Long" /&gt; (For animals, the only taxonomic unit below the [[species]] level is usually the subspecies;&lt;ref name="conservation" /&gt; there are narrower [[Infraspecific name|infraspecific ranks in botany]], and ''race'' does not correspond directly with any of them.) Traditionally, [[subspecies]] are seen as geographically isolated and genetically differentiated populations.&lt;ref name="Templeton 1998" /&gt; Studies of human genetic variation show that human populations are not geographically isolated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Templeton|first=Alan R.|date=1998|title=Human Races: A Genetic and Evolutionary Perspective|jstor=682042|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=100|issue=3|pages=632–650|issn=0002-7294|quote=Genetic surveys and the analyses of DNA haplotype trees show that human "races" are not distinct lineages, and that this is not due to recent admixture; human "races" are not and never were "pure."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their genetic differences are far smaller than those among comparable subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Relethford|first=John H.|date=23 February 2017|title=Biological Anthropology, Population Genetics, and Race|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190236953.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190236953-e-20|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Race|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190236953.013.20|accessdate=2018-03-27|quote="Human populations do not exhibit the levels of geographic isolation or genetic divergence to fit the subspecies model of race."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, [[Sewall Wright]] suggested that human populations that have long inhabited separated parts of the world should, in general, be considered different subspecies by the criterion that most individuals of such populations can be allocated correctly by inspection. Wright argued that, "It does not require a trained anthropologist to classify an array of Englishmen, West Africans, and Chinese with 100% accuracy by features, skin color, and type of hair despite so much variability within each of these groups that every individual can easily be distinguished from every other."&lt;ref name="Wright 1978" /&gt; While in practice subspecies are often defined by easily observable physical appearance, there is not necessarily any evolutionary significance to these observed differences, so this form of classification has become less acceptable to evolutionary biologists.&lt;ref name="Keita; Templeton" /&gt;  Likewise this [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] approach to race is generally regarded as discredited by biologists and anthropologists.

====Ancestrally differentiated populations (clades)====
Some researchers{{Who|date=March 2018}} have tried to clarify the idea of race by equating it to the biological idea of the [[clade]]. A [[clade]] is a taxonomic group of organisms consisting of a single common ancestor and all the descendants of that ancestor (a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] group). Every creature produced by sexual reproduction has two immediate lineages, one maternal and one paternal.&lt;ref name="Anth. News 2006" /&gt; Whereas [[Carl Linnaeus]] established a taxonomy of living organisms based on anatomical similarities and differences, [[cladistics]] seeks to establish a taxonomy&amp;nbsp;– the [[phylogenetic tree]]&amp;nbsp;– based on genetic similarities and differences and tracing the process of acquisition of multiple characteristics by single organisms.

Philosopher Robin Andreasen (2000) proposes that cladistics can be used to categorize human races biologically, and that races can be both biologically real and socially constructed.&lt;ref name="Andreasen 2000" /&gt; Andreasen cites tree diagrams of relative [[genetic distance]]s among populations published by [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Luigi Cavalli-Sforza]] as the basis for a phylogenetic tree of human races: "Cavalli-Sforza's research illustrates that it is possible to reconstruct human evolutionary history, and this means that it is possible to provide a cladistic definition of race" (p. S661). Evolutionary biologist Alan Templeton (2013) argues that while "Much of the recent scientific literature on human evolution portrays human populations as separate branches on an evolutionary tree," multiple lines of evidence falsify a phylogenetic tree structure, and confirm the presence of gene flow among populations.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Jonathan Marks (2008) argues that Andreasen has misinterpreted the genetic literature: "These trees are phenetic (based on similarity), rather than cladistic (based on based on monophyletic descent, that is from a series of unique ancestors)."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marks|2008}}, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Marks, Templeton, and Cavalli-Sforza all conclude that genetics does not provide evidence of human races.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marks|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists Lieberman and Jackson (1995) also critique the use of cladistics to support concepts of race. They claim that "the molecular and biochemical proponents of this model explicitly use racial categories ''in their initial grouping of samples''". For example, the large and highly diverse macroethnic groups of East Indians, North Africans, and Europeans are presumptively grouped as Caucasians prior to the analysis of their DNA variation. This is claimed to limit and skew interpretations, obscure other lineage relationships, deemphasize the impact of more immediate clinal environmental factors on genomic diversity, and can cloud our understanding of the true patterns of affinity. They suggest that the authors of these studies find support for racial distinctions only because they began by assuming the validity of race. "For empirical reasons we prefer to place emphasis on clinal variation, which recognizes the existence of adaptive human hereditary variation and simultaneously stresses that such variation is not found in packages that can be labeled ''races''."&lt;ref name="Lieberman 1995" /&gt;

Human population groups are not monophyletic, as there appears to always have been considerable gene flow between human populations.&lt;ref name="Templeton 1998" /&gt; Keith Hunley, Graciela Cabana, and Jeffrey Long analyzed the [[Human Genome Diversity Project]] sample of 1,037 individuals in 52 populations.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hunley|first1=Keith L.|last2=Cabana|first2=Graciela S.|last3=Long|first3=Jeffrey C.|date=1 December 2015|title=The apportionment of human diversity revisited|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.22899/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=160|pages=561–569|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22899|issn=1096-8644|pmid=26619959|accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that non-African populations are a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] subgroup of African populations, that "some African populations are equally related to other African populations and to non-African populations," and that "outside of Africa, regional groupings of populations are nested inside one another, and many of them are not monophyletic."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Rachel Caspari (2003) has argued that since no groups currently regarded as races are monophyletic, none of those groups can be clades.

==== Morphologically differentiated populations ====
Population geneticists have debated whether the concept of ''population'' can provide a basis for a new conception of race. To do this, a working definition of population must be found. Surprisingly, there is no generally accepted concept of population that biologists use. Although the concept of population is central to ecology, evolutionary biology and conservation biology, most definitions of population rely on qualitative descriptions such as "a group of organisms of the same species occupying a particular space at a particular time".&lt;ref name="waples" /&gt; Waples and Gaggiotti identify two broad types of definitions for populations; those that fall into an ''ecological paradigm'', and those that fall into an ''evolutionary paradigm''. Examples of such definitions are:
* ''Ecological paradigm'': A group of individuals of the same species that co-occur in space and time and have an opportunity to interact with each other.
* ''Evolutionary paradigm'': A group of individuals of the same species living in close-enough proximity that any member of the group can potentially mate with any other member.&lt;ref name="waples" /&gt;

Sesardic argues that when several traits are analyzed at the same time, [[Forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologists]] can classify a person's race with an accuracy of close to 100% based on only skeletal remains.&lt;ref name="Sesardic 2010" /&gt; Sesardic's claim has been disputed by [[Massimo Pigliucci]], who accused Sesardic of "cherry pick[ing] the scientific evidence and reach[ing] conclusions that are contradicted by it." Specifically, Pigliucci argues that Sesardic misrepresented a paper by Ousley et al. (2009), and neglected to mention that they identified differentiation not just between individuals from different races, but also between individuals from different tribes, local environments, and time periods.&lt;ref name="Pigliucci 2013"/&gt; This is discussed in a later section.&lt;!--needs work. "accuracy close to 100%" is meaningless without identifying what definition of race is used to match remains up to--&gt;

=====Clines=====
One crucial innovation in reconceptualizing genotypic and phenotypic variation was the anthropologist [[C. Loring Brace]]'s observation that such variations, insofar as it is affected by [[natural selection]], slow migration, or [[genetic drift]], are distributed along geographic gradations or [[cline (biology)|clines]].&lt;ref name="Brace 1964" /&gt; For example, with respect to skin color in Europe and Africa, Brace writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;To this day, skin color grades by imperceptible means from Europe southward around the eastern end of the Mediterranean and up the Nile into Africa. From one end of this range to the other, there is no hint of a skin color boundary, and yet the spectrum runs from the lightest in the world at the northern edge to as dark as it is possible for humans to be at the equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolution in an Anthropological View|last=Brace|first=C. Loring|date=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=|isbn=978-0-7425-0263-5|location=|pages=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In part this is due to [[isolation by distance]]. This point called attention to a problem common to phenotype-based descriptions of races (for example, those based on hair texture and skin color): they ignore a host of other similarities and differences (for example, blood type) that do not correlate highly with the markers for race. Thus, anthropologist Frank Livingstone's conclusion, that since clines cross racial boundaries, "there are no races, only clines".&lt;ref name="Livingstone" /&gt;

In a response to Livingstone, [[Theodore Dobzhansky]] argued that when talking about race one must be attentive to how the term is being used: "I agree with Dr. Livingstone that if races have to be 'discrete units', then there are no races, and if 'race' is used as an 'explanation' of the human variability, rather than vice versa, then the explanation is invalid." He further argued that one could use the term race if one distinguished between "race differences" and "the race concept". The former refers to any distinction in gene frequencies between populations; the latter is "a matter of judgment". He further observed that even when there is clinal variation, "Race differences are objectively ascertainable biological phenomena&amp;nbsp;... but it does not follow that racially distinct populations must be given racial (or subspecific) labels."&lt;ref name="Livingstone" /&gt; In short, Livingstone and Dobzhansky agree that there are genetic differences among human beings; they also agree that the use of the race concept to classify people, and how the race concept is used, is a matter of social convention. They differ on whether the race concept remains a meaningful and useful social convention.

}}

In 1964, the biologists Paul Ehrlich and Holm pointed out cases where two or more clines are distributed discordantly&amp;nbsp;– for example, melanin is distributed in a decreasing pattern from the equator north and south; frequencies for the haplotype for [[HBB#Sickle cell disease|beta-S hemoglobin]], on the other hand, radiate out of specific geographical points in Africa.&lt;ref name="ehrlich" /&gt; As the anthropologists Leonard Lieberman and Fatimah Linda Jackson observed, "Discordant patterns of heterogeneity falsify any description of a population as if it were genotypically or even phenotypically homogeneous".&lt;ref name="Lieberman 1995" /&gt;

Patterns such as those seen in human physical and genetic variation as described above, have led to the consequence that the number and geographic location of any described races is highly dependent on the importance attributed to, and quantity of, the traits considered. Scientists discovered a skin-lighting mutation that partially accounts for the appearance of Light skin in humans (people who migrated out of Africa northward into what is now Europe) which they estimate occurred 20,000 to 50,000 years ago. The East Asians owe their relatively light skin to different mutations.&lt;ref name="weiss" /&gt; On the other hand, the greater the number of traits (or [[allele]]s) considered, the more subdivisions of humanity are detected, since traits and gene frequencies do not always correspond to the same geographical location. Or as {{harvtxt|Ossorio|Duster| 2005}} put it:{{quote|1=Anthropologists long ago discovered that humans' physical traits vary gradually, with groups that are close geographic neighbors being more similar than groups that are geographically separated. This pattern of variation, known as clinal variation, is also observed for many alleles that vary from one human group to another. Another observation is that traits or alleles that vary from one group to another do not vary at the same rate. This pattern is referred to as nonconcordant variation. Because the variation of physical traits is clinal and nonconcordant, anthropologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries discovered that the more traits and the more human groups they measured, the fewer discrete differences they observed among races and the more categories they had to create to classify human beings. The number of races observed expanded to the 1930s and 1950s, and eventually anthropologists concluded that there were no discrete races.&lt;ref name="Marks 2002" /&gt; Twentieth and 21st century biomedical researchers have discovered this same feature when evaluating human variation at the level of alleles and allele frequencies. Nature has not created four or five distinct, nonoverlapping genetic groups of people.}}

====Genetically differentiated populations====
{{main|Race and genetics|Human genetic variation}}
Another way to look at differences between populations is to measure genetic differences rather than physical differences between groups. The mid-20th-century anthropologist [[William C. Boyd]] defined race as: "A population which differs significantly from other populations in regard to the frequency of one or more of the genes it possesses. It is an arbitrary matter which, and how many, gene loci we choose to consider as a significant 'constellation'".&lt;ref name="boyd" /&gt; Leonard Lieberman and Rodney Kirk have pointed out that "the paramount weakness of this statement is that if one gene can distinguish races then the number of races is as numerous as the number of human couples reproducing."&lt;ref name="lieberman" /&gt; Moreover, the anthropologist Stephen Molnar has suggested that the discordance of clines inevitably results in a multiplication of races that renders the concept itself useless.&lt;ref name="molnar" /&gt; The [[Human Genome Project]] states "People who have lived in the same geographic region for many generations may have some alleles in common, but no allele will be found in all members of one population and in no members of any other."&lt;ref name="project" /&gt; [[Massimo Pigliucci]] and Jonathan Kaplan argue that human races do exist, and that they correspond to the genetic classification of [[ecotype]]s, but that real human races do not correspond very much, if at all, to folk racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pigliucci|first1=Massimo|last2=Kaplan|first2=Jonathan|title=On the Concept of Biological Race and Its Applicability to Humans|journal=Philosophy of Science|date=December 2003|volume=70|issue=5|pages=1161–1172|doi=10.1086/377397}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Walsh &amp; Yun reviewed the literature in 2011 and reported that "Genetic studies using very few chromosomal loci find that genetic polymorphisms divide human populations into clusters with almost 100 percent accuracy and that they correspond to the traditional anthropological categories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walsh|first1=Anthony|last2=Yun|first2=Ilhong|title=Race and Criminology in the Age of Genomic Science|journal=Social Science Quarterly|pages=n/a|date=October 2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2011.00818.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some biologists argue that racial categories correlate with biological traits (e.g. [[phenotype]]), and that certain genetic markers have varying frequencies among human populations, some of which correspond more or less to traditional racial groupings. For this reason, there is no current consensus about whether racial categories can be considered to have significance for understanding human genetic variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bamshad |first1=M. |last2=Wooding |first2=S. |last3=Salisbury |first3=B.

===== Distribution of genetic variation =====
The distribution of genetic variants within and among human populations are impossible to describe succinctly because of the difficulty of defining a population, the clinal nature of variation, and heterogeneity across the genome (Long and Kittles 2003). In general, however, an average of 85% of statistical genetic variation exists within local populations, ~7% is between local populations within the same continent, and ~8% of variation occurs between large groups living on different continents.&lt;ref&gt;Lewontin 1972; Jorde ''et al.'' 2000a&lt;/ref&gt; The [[recent African origin]] theory for humans would predict that in Africa there exists a great deal more diversity than elsewhere and that diversity should decrease the further from Africa a population is sampled. Hence, the 85% average figure is misleading: Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only about 60% of human genetic diversity exists in the least diverse population they analyzed (the Surui, a population derived from New Guinea).&lt;ref name="LongKittles2"&gt;[[Race (human categorization)#CITEREFLongKittles2003|Long &amp;#x26; Kittles 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical analysis that takes this difference into account confirms previous findings that, "Western-based racial classifications have no taxonomic significance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hunley|first1=Keith L.|last2=Cabana|first2=Graciela S.|last3=Long|first3=Jeffrey C.|date=1 December 2015|title=The apportionment of human diversity revisited|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.22899/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=|pages=–|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22899|issn=1096-8644|accessdate=2016-01-23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cluster analysis=====
{{Main|Human genetic clustering}}

A 2002 study of random biallelic genetic loci found little to no evidence that humans were divided into distinct biological groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Romualdi |first=Chiara |last2=Balding |first2=David |last3=Nasidze |first3=Ivane S. |last4=Risch |first4=Gregory |last5=Robichaux |first5=Myles |last6=Sherry |first6=Stephen T. |last7=Stoneking |first7=Mark |last8=Batzer |first8=Mark A. |last9=Barbujani |first9=Guido |date=April 2002 |title=Patterns of human diversity, within and among continents, inferred from biallelic DNA polymorphisms  |journal=Genome Research |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=602–612 |doi=10.1101/gr.214902 |issn=1088-9051 |pmid=11932244 |pmc=187513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2003 paper, "[[Human Genetic Diversity: Lewontin's Fallacy]]", [[A. W. F. Edwards]] argued that rather than using a locus-by-locus analysis of variation to derive taxonomy, it is possible to construct a human classification system based on characteristic genetic patterns, or ''clusters'' [[Race and genetics#Genetic variation is structured by geographic origin|inferred from multilocus genetic data]].&lt;ref name="edwards" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins &amp; Wong"/&gt; Geographically based human studies since have shown that such genetic clusters can be derived from analyzing of a large number of loci which can assort individuals sampled into groups analogous to traditional continental racial groups.&lt;ref name="Harpending; et al." /&gt; Joanna Mountain and [[Neil Risch]] cautioned that while genetic clusters may one day be shown to correspond to phenotypic variations between groups, such assumptions were premature as the relationship between genes and [[complex traits]] remains poorly understood.&lt;ref name="mountain" /&gt; However, Risch denied such limitations render the analysis useless: "Perhaps just using someone's actual birth year is not a very good way of measuring age. Does that mean we should throw it out? ... Any category you come up with is going to be imperfect, but that doesn't preclude you from using it or the fact that it has utility."&lt;ref name="gitschier" /&gt;

Early human genetic cluster analysis studies were conducted with samples taken from ancestral population groups living at extreme geographic distances from each other. It was thought that such large geographic distances would maximize the genetic variation between the groups sampled in the analysis, and thus maximize the probability of finding cluster patterns unique to each group. In light of the historically recent acceleration of human migration (and correspondingly, human gene flow) on a global scale, further studies were conducted to judge the degree to which genetic cluster analysis can pattern ancestrally identified groups as well as geographically separated groups. One such study looked at a large multiethnic population in the United States, and "detected only modest genetic differentiation between different current geographic locales within each race/ethnicity group. Thus, ancient geographic ancestry, which is highly correlated with self-identified race/ethnicity&amp;nbsp;– as opposed to current residence&amp;nbsp;– is the major determinant of genetic structure in the U.S. population." ({{harvtxt|Tang|Quertermous|Rodriguez|Kardia|2005}})

{{harvtxt|Witherspoon|Wooding|Rogers|Marchani|2007}} have argued that even when individuals can be reliably assigned to specific population groups, it may still be possible for two randomly chosen individuals from different populations/clusters to be more similar to each other than to a randomly chosen member of their own cluster. They found that many thousands of genetic markers had to be used in order for the answer to the question "How often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations?" to be "never". This assumed three population groups separated by large geographic ranges (European, African and East Asian). The entire world population is much more complex and studying an increasing number of groups would require an increasing number of markers for the same answer. The authors conclude that "caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes."&lt;ref name="Witherspoon, et al. 2007" /&gt; Witherspoon, et al. concluded that, "The fact that, given enough genetic data, individuals can be correctly assigned to their populations of origin is compatible with the observation that most human genetic variation is found within populations, not between them. It is also compatible with our ﬁnding that, even when the most distinct populations are considered and hundreds of loci are used, individuals are frequently more similar to members of other populations than to members of their own population."&lt;ref name="Witherspoon, et al. 2007" /&gt;

Loring Brace]],&lt;ref name="Brace 2005" /&gt; the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther,&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Jonathan Michael Winther, Rasmus Grønfeldt (2014).

Prisoners of Abstraction? The Theory and Measure of Genetic Variation, and the Very Concept of 'Race' ''Biological Theory'' http://philpapers.org/archive/KAPPOA.14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the geneticist [[Joseph L. Graves|Joseph Graves]],&lt;ref name="Graves 2001" /&gt; have argued that while there it is certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds roughly to the groupings normally defined as "continental races", this is true for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental; if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials.&lt;ref name="evolutionary" /&gt; Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one [[Lumpers and splitters|wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers)]]. Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998&lt;ref&gt;Mills CW (1988) "But What Are You Really? The Metaphysics of Race" in ''Blackness visible: essays on philosophy and race'', pp. 41–66. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt;) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons. In earlier work, Winther had identified "diversity partitioning" and "clustering analysis" as two separate methodologies, with distinct questions, assumptions, and protocols.  Each is also associated with opposing ontological consequences vis-a-vis the metaphysics of race.&lt;ref&gt;Winther, Rasmus Grønfeldt (2014/2011). The Genetic Reification of Race? A Story of Two Mathematical Methods. ''Critical Philosophy of Race'' http://philpapers.org/archive/WINTGR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Lisa Gannett has argued that [[biogeographical ancestry]], a concept devised by [[Mark Shriver]] and [[Tony Frudakis]], is not an objective measure of the biological aspects of race as Shriver and Frudakis claim it is. She argues that it is actually just a "local category shaped by the U.S. context of its production, especially the forensic aim of being able to predict the race or ethnicity of an unknown suspect based on DNA found at the crime scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gannett|first1=Lisa|title=Biogeographical ancestry and race|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|date=September 2014|volume=47|pages=173–84|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2014.05.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Clines and clusters in genetic variation =====
Recent studies of [[human genetic clustering]] have included a debate over how genetic variation is organized, with clusters and clines as the main possible orderings. {{harvtxt|Serre|Pääbo| 2004}} argued for smooth, clinal genetic variation in ancestral populations even in regions previously considered racially homogeneous, with the apparent gaps turning out to be artifacts of sampling techniques. {{harvtxt|Rosenberg|Mahajan|Ramachandran|Zhao|2005}} disputed this and offered an analysis of the Human Genetic Diversity Panel showing that there were small discontinuities in the smooth genetic variation for ancestral populations at the location of geographic barriers such as the [[Sahara]], the Oceans, and the [[Himalayas]]. Nonetheless, {{harvtxt|Rosenberg|Mahajan|Ramachandran|Zhao|2005}} stated that their findings “should not be taken as evidence of our support of any particular concept of biological race... Genetic differences among human populations derive mainly from gradations in allele frequencies rather than from distinctive 'diagnostic' genotypes." Using a sample of 40 populations distributed roughly evenly across the Earth's land surface, {{harvtxt|Xing|et. al.|2010|p=208}} found that "genetic diversity is distributed in a more clinal pattern when more geographically intermediate populations are sampled."

[[Guido Barbujani]] has written that human genetic variation is generally distributed continuously in gradients across much of Earth, and that there is no evidence that genetic boundaries between human populations exist as would be necessary for human races to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Barbujani|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, human genetic variation has formed a nested structure that is inconsistent with the concept of races that have evolved independently of one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunley|first1=Keith L.|last2=Healy|first2=Meghan E.|last3=Long|first3=Jeffrey C.|date=18 February 2009|title=The global pattern of gene identity variation reveals a history of long-range migrations, bottlenecks, and local mate exchange: Implications for biological race|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=139|issue=1|pages=35–46|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20932|pmid=19226641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social constructions===
{{Main|Race and society|Racialism}}

As anthropologists and other evolutionary scientists have shifted away from the language of race to the term ''population'' to talk about genetic differences, [[History|historians]], [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] and other [[social sciences|social scientists]] re-conceptualized the term "race" as a cultural category or [[social construct]], i.e., a way among many possible ways in which  a society chooses to divide its members into categories.

Many social scientists have replaced the word race with the word "[[Ethnic group#Ethnicity and race|ethnicity]]" to refer to self-identifying groups based on beliefs concerning shared culture, ancestry and history.{{dubious|date=October 2016}} Alongside empirical and conceptual problems with "race", following the [[Second World War]], evolutionary and social scientists were acutely aware of how beliefs about race had been used to justify discrimination, apartheid, slavery, and genocide. This questioning gained momentum in the 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States and the emergence of numerous anti-colonial movements worldwide. They thus came to believe that race itself is a [[Social construction|social construct]], a concept that was believed to correspond to an objective reality but which was believed in because of its social functions.&lt;ref name="Gordon 1964" /&gt;

Craig Venter and Francis Collins of the National Institute of Health jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome in 2000. Upon examining the data from the genome mapping, Venter realized that although the genetic variation within the human species is on the order of 1–3% (instead of the previously assumed 1%), the types of variations do not support notion of genetically defined races. Venter said, "Race is a social concept. It's not a scientific one. There are no bright lines (that would stand out), if we could compare all the sequenced genomes of everyone on the planet." "When we try to apply science to try to sort out these social differences, it all falls apart."&lt;ref name="FORA.tv 2008" /&gt;

Stephan Palmié asserted that race "is not a thing but a social relation";&lt;ref name="Palmie 2007" /&gt; or, in the words of [[Katya Gibel Mevorach]], "a metonym", "a human invention whose criteria for differentiation are neither universal nor fixed but have always been used to manage difference."&lt;ref name="Mevorach 2007" /&gt; As such, the use of the term "race" itself must be analyzed. Moreover, they argue that biology will not explain why or how people use the idea of race: History and social relationships will.

[[Imani Perry]] has argued that race "is produced by social arrangements and political decision making."&lt;ref&gt;Imani Perry, More Beautiful and More Terrible: The Embrace and Transcendence of Racial Inequality in the United States (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2011), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Perry explains race more in stating, "race is something that happens, rather than something that is. It is dynamic, but it holds no objective truth."&lt;ref&gt;Imani Perry, More Beautiful and More Terrible: The Embrace and Transcendence of Racial Inequality in the United States (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2011), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have challenged the notion that race is primarily a social construction by arguing that race has a biological basis.&lt;ref name="Tang2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tang|first1=H. |last2=Quertermous|first2=T. |last3=Rodriguez|first3=B. |title=Genetic Structure, Self-Identified Race/Ethnicity, and Confounding in Case-Control Association Studies |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=268–75 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15625622 |pmc=1196372 |doi=10.1086/427888|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the researchers, [[Neil Risch]], noted: "we looked at the correlation between genetic structure [based on microsatellite markers] versus self-description, we found 99.9% concordance between the two. We actually had a higher discordance rate between self-reported sex and markers on the X chromosome! So you could argue that sex is also a problematic category. And there are differences between sex and gender; self-identification may not be correlated with biology perfectly. And there is sexism."&lt;ref name="Gitschier2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Risch |first=N. |title=The whole side of it&amp;nbsp;– an interview with Neil Risch by Jane Gitschier |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=e14 |date=July 2005 |pmid=17411332 |pmc=1183530 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
{{Main|Race in Brazil}}
[[File:Redenção.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Portrait "Redenção de Cam" (1895), showing a Brazilian family becoming "whiter" each generation.]]
Compared to 19th-century United States, 20th-century [[Demographics of Brazil|Brazil]] was characterized by a perceived relative absence of sharply defined racial groups. According to anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]], this pattern reflects a different history and different [[social relations]].

Basically, race in Brazil was "biologized", but in a way that recognized the difference between ancestry (which determines [[genotype]]) and [[phenotypic]] differences. There, racial identity was not governed by rigid descent rule, such as the [[one-drop rule]], as it was in the United States. A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both parents, nor were there only a very limited number of categories to choose from,&lt;ref name="Harris 1980" /&gt; to the extent that full [[sibling]]s can pertain to different racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=140919 | pmid=12509516 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0126614100 | volume=100 | issue=1 | title=Color and genomic ancestry in Brazilians | date=January 2003 | journal=Proc.

Over a dozen racial categories would be recognized in conformity with all the possible combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and not one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That is, race referred preferentially to appearance, not heredity, and appearance is a poor indication of ancestry, because only a few genes are responsible for someone's skin color and traits: a person who is considered white may have more African ancestry than a person who is considered black, and the reverse can be also true about European ancestry.&lt;ref name="BBC delves into Brazilians' roots"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6284806.stm BBC delves into Brazilians' roots] accessed 13 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of racial classifications in Brazil reflects the extent of [[miscegenation]] in [[Brazilian society]], a society that remains highly, but not strictly, [[social stratification|stratified]] along color lines. These [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic]] factors are also significant to the limits of racial lines, because a minority of ''[[pardo]]s'', or brown people, are likely to start declaring themselves white or black if socially upward,&lt;ref&gt;RIBEIRO, Darcy. O Povo Brasileiro, Companhia de Bolso, fourth reprint, 2008 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and being seen as relatively "whiter" as their perceived social status increases (much as in other regions of Latin America).&lt;ref&gt;Levine-Rasky, Cynthia. 2002.

It is a cliché formulated and reformulated throughout the region, a truism dependant upon the social experience that wealth is associated with whiteness, and that in obtaining the former one may become aligned with the latter (and vice versa)"."&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluidity of racial categories aside, the "biologification" of race in Brazil referred above would match contemporary concepts of race in the United States quite closely, though, if Brazilians are supposed to choose their race as one among, Asian and Indigenous apart, three IBGE's census categories. While assimilated [[Amerindians]] and people with very high quantities of Amerindian ancestry are usually grouped as ''[[caboclo]]s'', a subgroup of ''pardos'' which roughly translates as both [[mestizo]] and [[hillbilly]], for those of lower quantity of Amerindian descent a higher European genetic contribution is expected to be grouped as a ''pardo''. In several genetic tests, people with less than 60-65% of European descent and 5–10% of Amerindian descent usually cluster with [[Afro-Brazilian]]s (as reported by the individuals), or 6.9% of the population, and those with about 45% or more of Subsaharan contribution most times do so (in average, Afro-Brazilian DNA was reported to be about 50% Subsaharan African, 37% European and 13% Amerindian).&lt;ref name="plosone.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afrobras"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101124105905/http://www.afrobras.org.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2112&amp;Itemid=2 Negros de origem européia]. afrobras.org.br&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genetic signatures of parental contribution in black and white populations in Brazil |doi=10.1590/S1415-47572009005000001|date=2009|last1=Guerreiro-Junior|first1=Vanderlei|last2=Bisso-Machado|first2=Rafael|last3=Marrero|first3=Andrea|last4=Hünemeier|first4=Tábita|last5=Salzano|first5=Francisco M.|last6=Bortolini|first6=Maria Cátira|journal=Genetics and Molecular Biology|volume=32|pages=1–11|pmid=21637639|issue=1|pmc=3032968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genetic heritage variability of Brazilians in even regional averages, 2009 study |doi=10.1590/S0100-879X2009005000026|date=2009|last1=Pena|first1=S.D.J.|last2=Bastos-Rodrigues|first2=L.|last3=Pimenta|first3=J.R.|last4=Bydlowski|first4=S.P.|journal=Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research|volume=42|issue=10|pages=870–876|pmid=19738982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a more consistent report with the genetic groups in the gradation of miscegenation is to be considered (e.g. that would not cluster people with a balanced degree of African and non-African ancestry in the black group instead of the multiracial one, unlike elsewhere in Latin America where people of high quantity of African descent tend to classify themselves as mixed), more people would report themselves as white and ''pardo'' in Brazil (47.7% and 42.4% of the population as of 2010, respectively), because by research its population is believed to have between 65 and 80% of autosomal European ancestry, in average (also &gt;35% of European mt-DNA and &gt;95% of European Y-DNA).&lt;ref name="plosone.org"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0017063 |title=The Genomic Ancestry of Individuals from Different Geographical Regions of Brazil Is More Uniform Than Expected |date=2011 |first1=Sérgio D.

From the last decades of the [[Empire of Brazil|Empire]] until the 1950s, the proportion of the white population increased significantly while Brazil welcomed 5.5 million immigrants between 1821 and 1932, not much behind its neighbor Argentina with 6.4 million,&lt;ref name="whitaker"&gt;''Argentina''. by Arthur P. Whitaker. New Jersey: Prentice Hall Inc, 1984. Cited in  [http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1990/1/90.01.06.x.html Yale immigration study]&lt;/ref&gt; and it received more European immigrants in its colonial history than the United States. Between 1500 and 1760, 700.000 Europeans settled in Brazil, while 530.000 Europeans settled in the United States for the same given time.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Renato Pinto Venâncio, "Presença portuguesa: de colonizadores a imigrantes" i.e. Portuguese presence: from colonizers to immigrants, chap. 3 of Brasil: 500 anos de povoamento (IBGE).

====European Union====
According to [[European Council]]:
{{quote|The European Union rejects theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races.|''Directive 2000/43/EC''&lt;ref name="Council Directive 2000/43/EC"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Council of the European Union |author-link=European Council |title=Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin |work=Official Journal |publisher=[[European Union]] |date=19 July 2000&lt;!--date of actual publication--&gt; |pp=22–26 |id=CELEX: 32000L0043 |url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0043:en:HTML |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The [[European Union]] uses the terms racial origin and ethnic origin synonymously in its documents and according to it "the use of the term 'racial origin' in this directive does not imply an acceptance of such [racial] theories".&lt;ref name="Council Directive 2000/43/EC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanrights.is/human-rights-and-iceland/equality--non-discrimination/ |title=European Union Directives on the Prohibition of Discrimination |work=HumanRights.is |publisher=Icelandic Human Rights Centre |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724051826/http://www.humanrights.is/human-rights-and-iceland/equality--non-discrimination |archivedate=24 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2015}} Haney López warns that using "race" as a category within the law tends to legitimize its existence in the popular imagination. In the diverse geographic context of [[Europe]], ethnicity and ethnic origin are arguably more resonant and are less encumbered by the ideological baggage associated with "race". In European context, historical resonance of "race" underscores its problematic nature. In some states, it is strongly associated with laws promulgated by the [[Nazi]] and [[Fascist]] governments in Europe during the 1930s and 1940s. Indeed, in 1996, the [[European Parliament]] adopted a resolution stating that "the term should therefore be avoided in all official texts".&lt;ref name="fds.oup.com"&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Bell |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/pdf/13/9780199297849_chapter1.pdf |title=Racism and Equality in the European Union |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2009 |isbn=9780199297849 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199297849.001.0001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202235619/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/pdf/13/9780199297849_chapter1.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of racial origin relies on the notion that human beings can be separated into biologically distinct "races", an idea generally rejected by the scientific community. Since all human beings belong to the same species, the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance|ECRI]] (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance) rejects theories based on the existence of different "races". However, in its Recommendation ECRI uses this term in order to ensure that those persons who are generally and erroneously perceived as belonging to "another race" are not excluded from the protection provided for by the legislation. The law claims to reject the existence of "race", yet penalize situations where someone is treated less favourably on this ground.&lt;ref name="fds.oup.com" /&gt;

====France====
Since the end of the Second World War, [[France]] has become an ethnically diverse country. Today, approximately five percent of the French population is non-European and non-white. This does not approach the number of non-white citizens in the United States (roughly 28–37%, depending on how Latinos are classified (see [[Demographics of the United States]]). Nevertheless, it amounts to at least three million people, and has forced the issues of ethnic diversity onto the French policy agenda. France has developed an approach to dealing with ethnic problems that stands in contrast to that of many advanced, industrialized countries. Unlike the United States, Britain, or even the Netherlands, France maintains a "[[Color blind (race)|color-blind]]" model of public policy. This means that it targets virtually no policies directly at racial or ethnic groups. Instead, it uses geographic or class criteria to address issues of social inequalities. It has, however, developed an extensive anti-racist policy repertoire since the early 1970s. Until recently, French policies focused primarily on issues of hate speech&amp;nbsp;– going much further than their American counterparts&amp;nbsp;– and relatively less on issues of discrimination in jobs, housing, and in provision of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2001/05/france-bleich Race Policy in France] by Erik Bleich, Middlebury College, 2012-05-01&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main|Race and ethnicity in the United States}}
{{See also|Miscegenation#Admixture in the United States|Historical racial and ethnic demographics of the United States}}

In the United States, there is disagreement on the nature of race within the biological sciences, whereas the social constructionist view is dominant in the social sciences; over time, biological views on race have become more controversial across all disciplines, with clear divides along generational, cultural, and racial lines.&lt;ref name="morning"&gt;{{cite book |title=How Scientists Think and Teach about Human Difference |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zXc1lgMQoQkC |publisher=University of California Press |last=Morning |first=Ann |date=2011 |pages=47 |isbn=9780520950146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immigrants to the [[Americas]] came from every region of Europe, Africa, and Asia. They [[miscegenation|mixed]] among themselves and with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous inhabitants of the continent]]. In the [[United States]] most people who self-identify as [[African American|African–American]] have some [[European ethnic groups|European ancestors]], while many people who identify as [[European American]] have some African or Amerindian ancestors.

Since the early history of the United States, Amerindians, African–Americans, and European Americans have been classified as belonging to different races. Efforts to track mixing between groups led to a proliferation of categories, such as [[mulatto]] and [[octoroon]]. The criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], increasing numbers of Americans began to consider anyone with "[[one-drop theory|one drop]]" of known "Black blood" to be Black, regardless of appearance. By the early 20th century, this notion was made statutory in many states. [[Amerindians]] continue to be defined by a certain percentage of "Indian blood" (called ''[[Blood quantum laws|blood quantum]]''). To be White one had to have perceived "pure" White ancestry. The one-drop rule or hypodescent rule refers to the convention of defining a person as racially black if he or she has any known African ancestry.  This rule meant that those that were mixed race but with some discernible African ancestry were defined as black.  The one-drop rule is specific to not only those with African ancestry but to the United States, making it a particularly African-American experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sexton|first=Jared|title=Amalgamation Schemes|date=2008|publisher=Univ of Minnesota Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Census|decennial censuses]] conducted since 1790 in the United States created an incentive to establish racial categories and fit people into these categories.&lt;ref name="nobles" /&gt;

The term "[[Hispanic]]" as an [[ethnonym]] emerged in the 20th century with the rise of migration of laborers from the [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking countries]] of [[Latin America]] to the United States. Today, the word "Latino" is often used as a synonym for "Hispanic". The definitions of both terms are non-race specific, and include people who consider themselves to be of distinct races (Black, White, Amerindian, Asian, and mixed groups).&lt;ref name="OMB 1997" /&gt; However, there is a common misconception in the US that Hispanic/Latino is a race&lt;ref&gt;Horsman, Reginald, ''Race and Manifest Destiny: The Origins of American Radial Anglo-Saxonism'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts,  1981 p. 210.  This reference is speaking in historic terms bt there is not reason to think that this perception has altered much&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes even that national origins such as Mexican, Cuban, Colombian, Salvadoran, etc. are races. In contrast to "Latino" or "Hispanic", "[[Anglo]]" refers to non-Hispanic [[White American]]s or non-Hispanic [[European American]]s, most of whom speak the English language but are not necessarily of [[English people|English]] descent.

==Views across disciplines over time==
One result of debates over the meaning and validity of the concept of race is that the current literature across different disciplines regarding human variation lacks [[scientific consensus|consensus]], though within some fields, such as some branches of anthropology, there is strong consensus. Some studies use the word race in its early [[essentialism|essentialist]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] sense. Many others still use the term race, but use it to mean a population, [[clade]], or [[haplogroup]]. Others eschew the concept of race altogether, and use the concept of population as a less problematic unit of analysis.

[[Eduardo Bonilla-Silva]], Sociology professor at Duke University, remarks,&lt;ref&gt;Race, Class, and Gender in the United States (text only) 7th (Seventh) edition by P. S. Rothenberg p131&lt;/ref&gt; "I contend that racism is, more than anything else, a matter of group power; it is about a dominant racial group (whites) striving to maintain its systemic advantages and minorities fighting to subvert the racial status quo."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, Racism Without Racists (Second Edition) (2006), Rowman and Littlefield&lt;/ref&gt; The types of practices that take place under this new color-blind racism is subtle, institutionalized, and supposedly not racial. Color-blind racism thrives on the idea that race is no longer an issue in the United States.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006" /&gt; There are contradictions between the alleged color-blindness of most whites and the persistence of a color-coded system of inequality. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}In [[Poland]], the race concept was rejected by 25 percent of anthropologists in 2001, although: "Unlike the U.S. anthropologists, Polish anthropologists tend to regard race as a term without taxonomic value, often as a substitute for population."&lt;ref name="Kaszycka, Strziko 2003" /&gt;

===Anthropology===
{{Refimprove science|section|date=August 2017}}

The concept of typological race classification in physical anthropology lost credibility around the 1960s and is now considered untenable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A companion to Biological Anthropology|editor1-last=Larsen|editor1-first=Clark Spencer|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4051-8900-2|pages=13, 26|quote='Race' as a typological characterization of human variation was to become a dominant theme in physical anthropology until the mid-twentieth century. ... Controversies over race did not end in the 1960s ... but there is a general sense in physical anthropology that the earlier use of race as a unit of study or as a conceptual unit is no longer viable and that this transition came in the 1960s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wagner et al. (2017) surveyed 3,286 American anthropologists' views on race and genetics, including both cultural and biological andthropologists. They found a consensus among them that biological races do not exist in humans, but that race does exist insofar as the social experiences of members of different races can have significant effects on health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Yu|first2=Joon-Ho|last3=Ifekwunigwe|first3=Jayne O.|last4=Harrell|first4=Tanya M.|last5=Bamshad|first5=Michael J.|last6=Royal|first6=Charmaine D.|date=February 2017|title=Anthropologists' views on race, ancestry, and genetics|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=162|issue=2|pages=318–327|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23120|pmid=27874171|last1=Wagner|first1=Jennifer K.|pmc=5299519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wang, Štrkalj et al. (2003) examined the use of race as a biological concept in research papers published in China's only biological anthropology journal, ''Acta Anthropologica Sinica''. The study showed that the race concept was widely used among Chinese anthropologists.&lt;ref name="racechina1"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wang|first2=Qian|date=2003|title=On the Concept of Race in Chinese Biological Anthropology: Alive and Well|url=http://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/on-the-concept-of-race-in-chinese-biological-anthropology-alive-and-well.pdf|journal=Current Anthropology|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|volume=44|issue=3|page=403|doi=10.1086/374899|last1=Štrkalj|first1=Goran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="racechina3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=306ruTniZmcC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Forensic Anthropology: 2000 to 2010|last2=Ferguson|first2=Elidh|date=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=1-439-84588-3|page=125|last1=Black|first1=Sue}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 review paper, Štrkalj suggested that the stark contrast of the racial approach between the United States and China was due to the fact that race is a factor for social cohesion among the ethnically diverse people of China, whereas "race" is a very sensitive issue in America and the racial approach is considered to undermine social cohesion&amp;nbsp;– with the result that in the socio-political context of US academics scientists are encouraged not to use racial categories, whereas in China they are encouraged to use them.&lt;ref name="racechina2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Štrkalj|first=Goran|date=2007|title=The Status of the Race Concept in Contemporary Biological Anthropology: A Review|url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/T-Anth/Anth-09-0-000-000-2007-Web/Anth-09-1-000-000-2007-Abst-PDF/Anth-09-1-073-078-2007-422-%20%8Atrkalj-G/Anth-09-1-073-078-2007-422-%20%8Atrkalj-G-Tt.pdf|journal=Anthropologist|publisher=Kamla-Raj|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieberman et al. in a 2004 study researched the acceptance of race as a concept among anthropologists in the United States, Canada, the Spanish speaking areas, Europe, Russia and China. Rejection of race ranged from high to low, with the highest rejection rate in the United States and Canada, a moderate rejection rate in Europe, and the lowest rejection rate in Russia and China. Methods used in the studies reported included questionnaires and content analysis.&lt;ref name="nih10" /&gt;

Kaszycka et al. (2009) in 2002–2003 surveyed European anthropologists' opinions toward the biological race concept. Three factors, country of academic education, discipline, and age, were found to be significant in differentiating the replies. Those educated in Western Europe, physical anthropologists, and middle-aged persons rejected race more frequently than those educated in Eastern Europe, people in other branches of science, and those from both younger and older generations." The survey shows that the views on race are sociopolitically (ideologically) influenced and highly dependent on education."&lt;ref name="anthropologists" /&gt;

====United States====
Since the second half of the 20th century, [[physical anthropology]] in the United States has moved away from a typological understanding of human biological diversity towards a genomic and population-based perspective. Anthropologists have tended to understand race as a social classification of humans based on phenotype and ancestry as well as cultural factors, as the concept is understood in the social sciences.&lt;ref name="Caspari, Lieberman et al"/&gt; Since 1932, an increasing number of [[college]] [[textbook]]s introducing physical anthropology have rejected race as a valid concept: from 1932 to 1976, only seven out of thirty-two rejected race; from 1975 to 1984, thirteen out of thirty-three rejected race; from 1985 to 1993, thirteen out of nineteen rejected race. According to one academic journal entry, where 78 percent of the articles in the 1931 ''Journal of Physical Anthropology'' employed these or nearly synonymous terms reflecting a bio-race paradigm, only 36 percent did so in 1965, and just 28 percent did in 1996.&lt;ref name="Lieberman, Kirk, et al. 2003" /&gt;

The "Statement on 'Race'" (1998) composed by a select committee of anthropologists and issued by the executive board of the [[American Anthropological Association]] as a statement they "believe [...] represents generally the contemporary thinking and scholarly positions of a majority of anthropologists", declares:&lt;ref name="AAAonRace" /&gt;

{{quote|In the United States both scholars and the general public have been conditioned to viewing human races as natural and separate divisions within the human species based on visible physical differences. With the vast expansion of scientific knowledge in this century, however, it has become clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups. Evidence from the analysis of genetics (e.g., DNA) indicates that most physical variation, about 94%, lies within so-called racial groups. Conventional geographic "racial" groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their genes. This means that there is greater variation within "racial" groups than between them. In neighboring populations there is much overlapping of genes and their phenotypic (physical) expressions. Throughout history whenever different groups have come into contact, they have interbred. The continued sharing of genetic materials has maintained all of humankind as a single species. [...]

With the vast expansion of scientific knowledge in this century, ... it has become clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups. [...] Given what we know about the capacity of normal humans to achieve and function within any culture, we conclude that present-day inequalities between so-called "racial" groups are not consequences of their biological inheritance but products of historical and contemporary social, economic, educational, and political circumstances.}}

A [[Statistical survey|survey]], taken in 1985 {{harv|Lieberman|Hampton|Littlefield|Hallead|1992}}, asked 1,200 American scientists how many '''disagree''' with the following proposition: "There are biological races in the species ''Homo sapiens''." The responses were for anthropologists:
* '''[[physical anthropologist]]s 41%'''
* '''[[cultural anthropologist]]s 53%'''&lt;ref name="presentations2005" /&gt;
The figure for physical anthropologists at [[PhD]] granting departments was slightly higher, rising from 41% to 42%, with 50% agreeing. Lieberman's study also showed that more women reject the concept of race than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Larry T. |last2=Lieberman |first2=Leonard |title=Race and Other Misadventures: Essays in Honor of Ashley Montagu in His Ninetieth Year |publisher=Altamira Press |date=1996 |isbn=1-882-28935-8 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; This survey, however, did not specify any particular definition of race (although it did clearly specify ''biological race'' within the ''species'' ''Homo sapiens''); it is difficult to say whether those who supported the statement thought of race in taxonomic or population terms.

The same survey, taken in 1999,&lt;ref name="Lieberman 2001" /&gt; showed the following changing results for anthropologists:
* '''[[physical anthropologist]]s 69%'''
* '''[[cultural anthropologist]]s 80%'''

However, a line of research conducted by Cartmill (1998) seemed to limit the scope of Lieberman's finding that there was "a significant degree of change in the status of the race concept". [[Goran Štrkalj]] has argued that this may be because Lieberman and collaborators had looked at all the members of the American Anthropological Association irrespective of their field of research interest, while Cartmill had looked specifically at biological anthropologists interested in human variation.&lt;ref name="Štrkalj 2007" /&gt;

According to the 2000 edition of a popular physical anthropology textbook, [[forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologists]] are overwhelmingly in support of the idea of the basic biological reality of human races.&lt;ref name="Gill 2000" /&gt; Forensic physical anthropologist and professor [[George W. Gill]] has said that the idea that race is only skin deep "is simply not true, as any experienced forensic anthropologist will affirm" and "Many morphological features tend to follow geographic boundaries coinciding often with climatic zones. This is not surprising since the selective forces of climate are probably the primary forces of nature that have shaped human races with regard not only to skin color and hair form but also the underlying bony structures of the nose, cheekbones, etc. (For example, more prominent noses humidify air better.)" While he can see good arguments for both sides, the complete denial of the opposing evidence "seems to stem largely from socio-political motivation and not science at all". He also states that many biological anthropologists see races as real yet "not one introductory textbook of physical anthropology even presents that perspective as a possibility. In a case as flagrant as this, we are not dealing with science but rather with blatant, politically motivated censorship".&lt;ref name="Gill 2000" /&gt;

In partial response to Gill's statement, Professor of Biological Anthropology [[C. Loring Brace]] argues that the reason laymen and biological anthropologists can determine the geographic ancestry of an individual can be explained by the fact that biological characteristics are [[cline (biology)|clinally]] distributed across the planet, and that does not translate into the concept of race. He states: {{Quote|text=Well, you may ask, why can't we call those regional patterns "races"? In fact, we can and do, but it does not make them coherent biological entities. "Races" defined in such a way are products of our perceptions. ... We realize that in the extremes of our transit&amp;nbsp;– Moscow to Nairobi, perhaps&amp;nbsp;– there is a major but gradual change in skin color from what we euphemistically call white to black, and that this is related to the latitudinal difference in the intensity of the ultraviolet component of sunlight. What we do not see, however, is the myriad other traits that are distributed in a fashion quite unrelated to the intensity of ultraviolet radiation. Where skin color is concerned, all the northern populations of the Old World are lighter than the long-term inhabitants near the equator. Although Europeans and Chinese are obviously different, in skin color they are closer to each other than either is to equatorial Africans. But if we test the distribution of the widely known ABO blood-group system, then Europeans and Africans are closer to each other than either is to Chinese.&lt;ref name="pbs" /&gt;}}
"Race" is still sometimes used within [[forensic anthropology]] (when analyzing skeletal remains), [[biomedical research]], and [[race-based medicine]].&lt;ref name="Gill; Armelagos; et al." /&gt;&lt;ref name=Witzig/&gt; Brace has criticized this, the practice of forensic anthropologists for using the controversial concept "race" out of convention when they in fact should be talking about regional ancestry. He argues that while forensic anthropologists can determine that a skeletal remain comes from a person with ancestors in a specific region of Africa, categorizing that skeletal as being "black" is a socially constructed category that is only meaningful in the particular context of the United States, and which is not itself scientifically valid.&lt;ref name="anthropology" /&gt;

In 2007, [[Ann Morning]] interviewed over 40 American biologists and anthropologists and found significant disagreements over the nature of race, with no one viewpoint holding a majority among either group.  Morning also argues that a third position, "antiessentialism", which holds that race is not a useful concept for biologists, should be introduced into this debate in addition to "constructionism" and "essentialism".&lt;ref name="MorningSocial"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morning|first1=Ann|title="Everyone Knows It's a Social Construct": Contemporary Science and the Nature of Race|journal=Sociological Focus|date=November 2007|volume=40|issue=4|pages=436–454|doi=10.1080/00380237.2007.10571319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology, anatomy, and medicine===
In the same 1985 survey {{harv|Lieberman|Hampton|Littlefield|Hallead|1992}}, 16% of the surveyed [[biology|biologists]] and 36% of the surveyed [[developmental psychology|developmental psychologists]] '''disagreed''' with the proposition: "There are biological races in the species ''Homo sapiens''."

The authors of the study also examined 77 college textbooks in biology and 69 in physical anthropology published between 1932 and 1989. Physical anthropology texts argued that biological races exist until the 1970s, when they began to argue that races do not exist. In contrast, biology textbooks did not undergo such a reversal but many instead dropped their discussion of race altogether. The authors attributed this to biologists trying to avoid discussing the political implications of racial classifications, instead of discussing them, and to the ongoing discussions in biology about the validity of the concept "subspecies". The authors also noted that some widely used textbooks in biology such as [[Douglas J. Futuyma]]'s 1986 "Evolutionary Biology" had abandoned the race concept, "The concept of race, masking the overwhelming genetic similarity of all peoples and the mosaic patterns of variation that do not correspond to racial divisions, is not only socially dysfunctional but is biologically indefensible as well (pp. 5 18–5 19)."{{harv|Lieberman|Hampton|Littlefield|Hallead|1992|pp=316–17}}

A 1994 examination of 32 English sport/exercise science textbooks found that 7 (21.9%) claimed that there are biophysical differences due to race that might explain differences in sports performance, 24 (75%) did not mention nor refute the concept, and 1 (3.12%) expressed caution with the idea.&lt;ref name="presentation" /&gt;

In February 2001, the editors of ''Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine'' asked "authors to not use race and ethnicity when there is no biological, scientific, or sociological reason for doing so."&lt;ref name="Rivara, Finberg 2001" /&gt; The editors also stated that "analysis by race and ethnicity has become an analytical knee-jerk reflex."&lt;ref name="nih" /&gt; ''Nature Genetics'' now ask authors to "explain why they make use of particular ethnic groups or populations, and how classification was achieved."&lt;ref name="profiling" /&gt;

Morning (2008) looked at high school biology textbooks during the 1952–2002 period and initially found a similar pattern with only 35% directly discussing race in the 1983–92 period from initially 92% doing so. However, this has increased somewhat after this to 43%. More indirect and brief discussions of race in the context of medical disorders have increased from none to 93% of textbooks. In general, the material on race has moved from surface traits to genetics and evolutionary history. The study argues that the textbooks' fundamental message about the existence of races has changed little.&lt;ref name="reconstructing" /&gt;

Surveying views on race in the scientific community in 2008, Morning says that they often split along culture and demographic lines and that, since Lieberman's surveys, biologists have failed to come to a clear consensus, noting that "At best, one can conclude that biologists and anthropologists now appear equally divided in their beliefs about the nature of race."&lt;ref name="MorningSocial" /&gt;

Gissis (2008) examined several important American and British journals in genetics, epidemiology and medicine for their content during the 1946–2003 period. He wrote that "Based upon my findings I argue that the category of race only ''seemingly'' disappeared from scientific discourse after World War II and has had a ''fluctuating yet continuous use'' during the time span from 1946 to 2003, and has even ''become more pronounced from the early 1970s on''".&lt;ref name="autogenerated" /&gt;

33 health services researchers from differing geographic regions were interviewed in a 2008 study. The researchers recognized the problems with racial and ethnic variables but the majority still believed these variables were necessary and useful.&lt;ref name="operationalization" /&gt;

A 2010 examination of 18 widely used English [[anatomy]] textbooks found that they all represented human biological variation in superficial and outdated ways, many of them making use of the race concept in ways that were current in 1950s anthropology. The authors recommended that anatomical education should describe human anatomical variation in more detail and rely on newer research that demonstrates the inadequacies of simple racial typologies.&lt;ref name="biological" /&gt;

=== Law ===
''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines race as "[a]n ethnical stock; a great division of mankind [sic] having in common certain distinguishing physical peculiarities constituting a comprehensive class appearance." &lt;ref&gt;Black, William Campbell. 1979, ''Black's Law Dictionary''. Fifth Edition. St. Paul, MN: West Publishing Company. P. 1132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
{{see also|Sociology of race and ethnic relations}}
[[Lester Frank Ward]] (1841-1913), considered to be one of the founders of American sociology, rejected notions that there were fundamental differences that distinguished one race from another, although he acknowledged that social conditions differed dramatically by race.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frazier | first1 = E.

White sociologist [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935), for example, used biological arguments to claim the inferiority of African Americans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; American sociologist [[Charles Cooley|Charles H. Cooley]] (1864–1929) theorized that differences among races were "natural," and that biological differences result in differences in intellectual abilities&lt;ref&gt;Cooley, Charles H. (1897) 1995.

Toronto: Random House Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Edward Alsworth Ross]] (1866-1951), also an important figure in the founding of American sociology, and an [[Eugenics|eugenicist]], believed that whites were the superior race, and that there were essential differences in "temperament" among races.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1910, the ''Journal'' published an article by [[Ulysses G. Weatherly]] (1865-1940) that called for white supremacy and segregation of the races to protect racial purity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] (1868–1963), one of the first African-American sociologists, was the first sociologist to use sociological concepts and empirical research methods to analyze race as a [[Social constructionism|social construct]] instead of a biological reality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Beginning in 1899 with his book ''The Philadelphia Negro'', Du Bois studied and wrote about race and racism throughout his career. In his work, he contended that [[social class]], [[colonialism]], and [[capitalism]] shaped ideas about race and racial categories. Social scientists largely abandoned scientific racism and biological reasons for racial categorization schemes by the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Fitzgerald, Kathleen J. ''Recognizing Race and Ethnicity: Power, Privilege, and Inequality.'' 2014. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists associated with the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] theorized that notions about race were socially constructed, and were not biological.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1978, [[William Julius Wilson]] (1935–) argued that race and racial classification systems were declining in significance, and that instead, [[social class]] more accurately described what sociologists had earlier understood as race.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, William Julius. 1978. "The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American Institutions." Pp. 765-776 in ''Social Stratification: Class, Race, and Gender in Sociological Perspective'', edited by David B. Grusky. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1986, sociologists [[Michael Omi]] and [[Howard Winant]] successfully introduced the concept of [[Racial formation theory|racial formation]] to describe the process by which racial categories are created.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Racial Formation in the United States|last=Omi|first=Michael|last2=Winant|first2=Howard|work=Social Stratification: Class, Race, and Gender in Sociological Perspective (4th edition)|publisher=Westview Press|year=2014|isbn=9780813346717|editor-last=Grusky|editor-first=David B.|location=Boulder, CO|page=|pages=683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omi and Winant assert that "there is no biological basis for distinguishing among human groups along the lines of race." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Today, sociologists generally understand race and racial categories as socially constructed, and reject racial categorization schemes that depend on biological differences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Political and practical uses==

===Biomedicine===
{{Main|Race and health}}
{{See also|Pharmacogenomics}}
In the United States, federal government policy promotes the use of racially categorized data to identify and address health disparities between racial or ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="hhs" /&gt; In clinical settings, race has sometimes been considered in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions. Doctors have noted that some medical conditions are more prevalent in certain racial or ethnic groups than in others, without being sure of the cause of those differences. Recent interest in [[race-based medicine]], or race-targeted [[pharmacogenomics]], has been fueled by the proliferation of human genetic data which followed the [[Human Genome Project|decoding]] of the [[human genome]] in the first decade of the twenty-first century. There is an active debate among biomedical researchers about the meaning and importance of race in their research. Proponents of the use of racial categories in biomedicine argue that continued use of racial categorizations in biomedical research and clinical practice makes possible the application of new genetic findings, and provides a clue to diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Risch 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Condit, et al. 2003" /&gt; Biomedical researchers' positions on race fall into two main camps: those who consider the concept of race to have no biological basis and those who consider it to have the potential to be biologically meaningful. Members of the latter camp often base their arguments around the potential to create genome-based [[personalized medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Catherine|title="Race" and "ethnicity" in biomedical research: How do scientists construct and explain differences in health?|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=March 2009|volume=68|issue=6|pages=1183–1190|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.12.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers point out that finding a difference in disease prevalence between two socially defined groups does not necessarily imply genetic causation of the difference.&lt;ref name="Graves 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fullwiley2011DNA" /&gt; They suggest that medical practices should maintain their focus on the individual rather than an individual's membership to any group.&lt;ref name="Harpending2006AnthropologicalGenetics" /&gt; They argue that overemphasizing genetic contributions to health disparities carries various risks such as reinforcing stereotypes, promoting racism or ignoring the contribution of non-genetic factors to health disparities.&lt;ref name="Lee, Mountain, et al." /&gt; International epidemiological data show that living conditions rather than race make the biggest difference in health outcomes even for diseases that have "race-specific" treatments.&lt;ref name="Kahn 2011" /&gt; Some studies have found that patients are reluctant to accept racial categorization in medical practice.&lt;ref name="Condit, et al. 2003" /&gt;

===Law enforcement===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}

{{Main|Racial profiling}}
{{See also|Race and crime in the United Kingdom|Race and crime in the United States}}
In an attempt to provide general descriptions that may facilitate the job of [[law enforcement officer]]s seeking to apprehend suspects, the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] employs the term "race" to summarize the general appearance (skin color, hair texture, eye shape, and other such easily noticed characteristics) of individuals whom they are attempting to apprehend. From the perspective of [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] officers, it is generally more important to arrive at a description that will readily suggest the general appearance of an individual than to make a scientifically valid categorization by DNA or other such means. Thus, in addition to assigning a wanted individual to a racial category, such a description will include: height, weight, eye color, scars and other distinguishing characteristics.

Criminal justice agencies in [[England]] and [[Wales]] use at least two separate racial/ethnic classification systems when reporting crime, as of 2010.  One is the system used in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001#Ethnicity|2001 Census]] when individuals identify themselves as belonging to a particular ethnic group: W1 (White-British), W2 (White-Irish), W9 (Any other white background); M1 (White and black Caribbean), M2 (White and black African), M3 (White and Asian), M9 (Any other mixed background); A1 (Asian-Indian), A2 (Asian-Pakistani), A3 (Asian-Bangladeshi), A9 (Any other Asian background); B1 (Black Caribbean), B2 (Black African), B3 (Any other black background); O1 (Chinese), O9 (Any other). The other is categories used by the police when they visually identify
someone as belonging to an ethnic group, e.g. at the time of a stop and search or an arrest: White – North European (IC1), White – South European (IC2), Black (IC3), Asian (IC4), Chinese, Japanese, or South East Asian (IC5), Middle Eastern (IC6), and Unknown (IC0).  "IC" stands for "Identification Code;" these items are also referred to as Phoenix classifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/statistics/mojstats/stats-race-cjs-2010.pdf "Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System 2010, Appendix C: Classifications of ethnicity "].

In many countries, such as [[France]], the state is legally banned from maintaining data based on race, which often makes the police issue wanted notices to the public that include labels like "dark skin complexion", etc.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the United States, the practice of [[racial profiling]] has been ruled to be both [[unconstitutional]] and a violation of [[civil rights]]. There is active debate regarding the cause of a marked correlation between the recorded crimes, punishments meted out, and the country's populations. Many consider ''de facto'' [[racial profiling]] an example of [[institutional racism]] in law enforcement. The history of misuse of racial categories to impact adversely one or more groups and/or to offer protection and advantage to another has a clear impact on debate of the legitimate use of known phenotypical or genotypical characteristics tied to the presumed race of both victims and perpetrators by the government.

Mass incarceration in the United States disproportionately impacts African American and Latino communities. Michelle Alexander, author of ''[[The New Jim Crow]]: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness'' (2010), argues that mass incarceration is best understood as not only a system of overcrowded prisons. Mass incarceration is also, "the larger web of laws, rules, policies, and customs that control those labeled criminals both in and out of prison."&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Alexander, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness (New York, NY: The New Press, 2010), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; She defines it further as "a system that locks people not only behind actual bars in actual prisons, but also behind virtual bars and virtual walls", illustrating the second-class citizenship that is imposed on a disproportionate number of people of color, specifically African-Americans.  She compares mass incarceration to [[Jim Crow laws]], stating that both work as racial caste systems.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Alexander, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness (New York, NY: The New Press, 2010), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many research findings appear to agree that the impact of victim race in the IPV arrest decision might possibly include a racial bias in favor of white victims. A 2011 study in a national sample of IPV arrests found that female arrest was more likely if the male victim was white and the female offender was black, while male arrest was more likely if the female victim was white. For both female and male arrest in IPV cases, situations involving married couples were more likely to lead to arrest compared to dating or divorced couples. More research is needed to understand agency and community factors that influence police behavior and how discrepancies in IPV interventions/ tools of justice can be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Dichter, ME, Marcus SM, Morabito MS, Rhodes KV: Explaining the IPV arrest decision: Incident, agency, and community factors. Criminal Justice Review, 2011; 36: 22-39&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work using DNA [[cluster analysis]] to determine race background has been used by some criminal investigators to narrow their search for the identity of both suspects and victims.&lt;ref name="abraham" /&gt;  Proponents of DNA profiling in criminal investigations cite cases where leads based on DNA analysis proved useful, but the practice remains controversial among medical ethicists, defense lawyers and some in law enforcement.&lt;ref name="willing" /&gt;

====Forensic anthropology====
{{Main|Forensic anthropology}}
Similarly, [[forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologists]] draw on highly heritable morphological features of human remains (e.g. cranial measurements) to aid in the identification of the body, including in terms of race. In a 1992 article, anthropologist [[Norman Sauer]] noted that anthropologists had generally abandoned the concept of race as a valid representation of human biological diversity, except for forensic anthropologists. He asked, "If races don't exist, why are forensic anthropologists so good at identifying them?"&lt;ref name="Sauer 1992" /&gt; He concluded:

{{quote|1=[T]he successful assignment of race to a skeletal specimen is not a vindication of the race concept, but rather a prediction that an individual, while alive was assigned to a particular socially constructed "racial" category. A specimen may display features that point to African ancestry. In this country that person is likely to have been labeled Black regardless of whether or not such a race actually exists in nature.&lt;ref name="Sauer 1992" /&gt;}}

Identification of the ancestry of an individual is dependent upon knowledge of the frequency and distribution of phenotypic traits in a population. This does not necessitate the use of a racial classification scheme based on unrelated traits, although the race concept is widely used in medical and legal contexts in the United States.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt; Some studies have reported that races can be identified with a high degree of accuracy using certain methods, such as that developed by Giles and Elliot. However, this method sometimes fails to be replicated in other times and places; for instance, when the method was re-tested to identify Native Americans, the average rate of accuracy dropped from 85% to 33%.&lt;ref name=goodman/&gt; Prior information about the individual (e.g. Census data) is also important in allowing the accurate identification of the individual's "race".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Konigsberg |first=Lyle W. |last2=Algee-Hewitt |first2=Bridget F.B. |last3=Steadman |first3=Dawnie Wolfe |date=1 May 2009 |title=Estimation and evidence in forensic anthropology: Sex and race |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.20934/abstract |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |language=en |volume=139 |issue=1 |pages=77–90 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.20934 |pmid=19226642 |issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different approach, anthropologist [[C. Loring Brace]] said:

{{quote|1=The simple answer is that, as members of the society that poses the question, they are inculcated into the social conventions that determine the expected answer. They should also be aware of the biological inaccuracies contained in that "politically correct" answer. Skeletal analysis provides no direct assessment of skin color, but it does allow an accurate estimate of original geographical origins. African, eastern Asian, and European ancestry can be specified with a high degree of accuracy. Africa of course entails "black", but "black" does not entail African.&lt;ref name="anthropology12" /&gt;}}

In association with a NOVA program in 2000 about race, he wrote an essay opposing use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/does-race-exist.html|title=Does Race Exist?|date=15 February 2000|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study found that about 13% of human craniometric variation existed between regions, while 81% existed within regions (the other 6% existed between local populations within the same region). In contrast, the opposite pattern of genetic variation was observed for skin color (which is often used to define race), with 88% of variation between regions. The study concluded that "The apportionment of genetic diversity in skin color is atypical, and cannot be used for purposes of classification."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Relethford | first1 = John H. | year = 2002 | title = Apportionment of global human genetic diversity based on craniometrics and skin color | url = http://references.260mb.com/Biometria/Relethford2002.pdf| journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 118 | issue = 4| pages = 393–98 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.10079 | pmid=12124919}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, a 2009 study found that craniometrics could be used accurately to determine what part of the world someone was from based on their cranium; however, this study also found that there were no abrupt boundaries that separated craniometric variation into distinct racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Relethford|first1=John H.|title=Race and global patterns of phenotypic variation|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=18 February 2009|volume=139|issue=1|pages=16–22|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20900|quote=Craniometric variation is geographically structured, allowing high levels of classification accuracy when comparing crania from different parts of the world. Nonetheless, the boundaries in global variation are not abrupt and do not fit a strict view of the race concept; the number of races and the cutoffs used to define them are arbitrary.|pmid=19226639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2009 study showed that American blacks and whites had different skeletal morphologies, and that significant patterning in variation in these traits exists within continents. This suggests that classifying humans into races based on skeletal characteristics would necessitate many different "races" being defined.&lt;ref name=ousley2009/&gt;

"In future issues of the ARCHIVES, we ask authors to not use race and ethnicity when there is no biological, scientific, or sociological reason for doing so. Race or ethnicity should not be used as explanatory variables, when the underlying constructs are variables that can, and should, be measured directly (eg, educational level of subjects, household income of the families, single vs 2-parent households, employment of parents, owning vs renting one's home, and other measures of socioeconomic status). In contrast, the recent attention on decreasing health disparities uses race and ethnicity not as explanatory variables but as ways of examining the underlying sociocultural reasons for these disparities and appropriately targeting attention and resources on children and adolescents with poorer health. In select issues and questions such as these, use of race and ethnicity is appropriate."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Repair Cafe by Ilvy Njiokiktjien.jpg|thumb|280px|Repair café Amsterdam-West]]
A '''repair café''' is a meeting in which people repair household electrical and mechanical devices, computers, bicycles, clothing, etc. They are organised by and for local residents. Repair cafés are held at a fixed location where tools are available and where they can fix their broken goods with the help of volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wackman|first1=John|title='Repair Café' Gets Stuff Fixed|url=http://www.rethinklocal.org/blog/2013/07/repair-cafe-gets-stuff-fixed/|website=Rethink Local website|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its objectives are to reduce waste, to maintain repair skills and to strengthen [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-85913052.html Global Village: Warum eine neue Bewegung aus den Niederlanden Toaster und Bügeleisen repariert ]" [[Der Spiegel]], 26 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www1.wdr.de/themen/ratgeber/repaircafe114.html Mehr reparieren, weniger konsumieren] [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]], 29 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sz-WohLQyQ Repair Cafe nu ook doorgedrongen in Duitsland]" [[heute]], 26 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aljazeera.com/video/europe/2012/07/201271654749156813.html Dutch group mends broken items for free]" [[Al Jazeera]], 16 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nieuws.vtm.be/binnenland/2013010832354-repareren-weer Repareren is weer in]" [[VTM (TV channel)|VTM]], 1 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.brusselnieuws.be/artikel/repair-cafe-verhuist-naar-elzenhof-opent-cafe-molenbeek Repair Café naar Elzenhof]" Brusselnieuws, 3 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept was devised by Martine Postma in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Sally McGrane, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/world/europe/amsterdam-tries-to-change-culture-with-repair-cafes.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; An Effort to Bury a Throwaway Culture One Repair at a Time]" [[The New York Times]], 8 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October 2009, the first Repair Café was held at Fijnhout Theater, [[Amsterdam-West]]. On 2 March 2010, the Repair Café Foundation was set up. The foundation was formed to support local groups around the world in setting up their own Repair Cafés.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/17/how-to-set-up-your-own-repair-cafe | date = 17 September 2014 | accessdate = 14 November 2016 | first1 = Katherine | last1 = Purvis | first2 = Nell | last2 = Card | first3 = Lucy | last3 = Palmer | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | location = London | title = How to set up your own repair café}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the number of Repair Cafés has grown quickly. In March 2016 Postma registered more than 1,000 Repair Cafés worldwide, 327 in the Netherlands, 309 in Germany, 22 in the UK, 21 in the US, 15 in Canada, four Australia and one in India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160319022011/http://repaircafe.org/bezoeken Visit a Repair Café], repaircafe.org captured archive.org on 19 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017 the number of Repair Cafés climbed over 1,200, in March 2018 the number reached 1,500 in 33 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170130020242/https://repaircafe.org/en/visit/ Visit a Repair Café], repaircafe.org captured archive.org on 30 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the first [[International Repair Day]] was announced. It is intended to be an annual event, taking place on the third Saturday of October each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voicemag.uk/blog/3325/dialogues-and-debates-ugo-vallauri|title=Dialogues and Debates: Ugo Vallauri|work=Voice Magazine|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data collection==
In 2017, the Repair Café Foundation developed an online tool - the [http://RepairMonitor.org RepairMonitor] - enabling volunteers to collect and share repair data via a central database. In March 2018, information about almost 4,000 repairs had been entered into this system, aiming to promote reparability and durability of products.   

==3D printing of broken parts==
Some repair cafés have begun to use 3D printers for replicating broken parts.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hbvl.be/cnt/aid1565685/repair-cafe-maakt-onvindbare-wisselstukken-met-3d-printer Repair café maakt onvindbare wisselstukken met 3D-printer]" [[Het Belang van Limburg]]&lt;/ref&gt; Broken pieces of domestic appliances may be able to be pieced or glued back together, after which they can be scanned with a [[3D scanner#Hand-held laser scanners|3D scanner]]. Examples of 3D scanners include David Starter-Kit, [[3D Systems]] Sense, [[MakerBot]] Digitizer, Fuel 3D, Microsoft [[Kinect]], and [[Asus]] Xtion.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Microsoft Kinect and Asus Xtion can be used together with ReconstructMe software for 3D scanning&lt;/ref&gt; Once the physical object is scanned, the 3D model is rendered. It can be converted to a .stl or .obj format and revised using [[geometry processing]] software such as makeprintable, netfabb, [[MeshLab]], Meshmixer, [[Ultimaker|Cura]], or [[Slic3r]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Cura and Slic3r have some fixup tools, despite being mainly a slicer program&lt;/ref&gt; It is printed using a [[3D printer client]], creating a physical part using the 3D printer. The complete process takes some time to complete.

To reduce the time needed in the repair café, people might choose to use a pre-made part from a website with 3D models (skipping the scanning step),&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Examples of such websites are [[Thingiverse]], [[CGTrader]], [[GrabCAD]], and Google [[3D Warehouse]]&lt;/ref&gt; or make the 3D model themselves by taking many photographs of the part and using something like [[Autodesk 123D|123D Catch]], and/or choose (in the event the repair café does not have its own 3D printer) to have the 3D ''model'' made in the repair café, but printed using a 3D printer elsewhere. Alternatively a 3D printing service like [[Ponoko]], [[Shapeways]], and others can be used, and a person then return to the repair café to have the new part fitted to the broken equipment.

'''Rudder ratio''' refers to a value that is monitored by the computerized [[flight control system]]s in modern [[aircraft]]. The ratio relates the  aircraft airspeed to the [[rudder]] deflection setting that is in effect at the time. As an aircraft accelerates, the deflection of the rudder needs to be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot. This automatic reduction process is needed because if the rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high-speed flight, it will cause the plane to sharply and violently [[Flight dynamics|yaw]], or swing from side to side, leading to loss of control and rudder, tail and other damages, even causing the aircraft to crash.

[[File:Orator at Speakers Corner, London, with crowd, 1974.jpg|thumb|right|Orator at Speakers' Corner in London, 1974]]
[[File:Hydeparkapril87.jpg|thumb|Speaker's Corner, April 1987]]

A '''Speakers' Corner''' is an area where [[public speaking|open-air public speaking]], debate, and discussion are allowed. The original and most noted is in the northeast corner of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in [[London]], [[England]].  Historically there were a number of other areas designated as Speakers' Corners in other parks in London (e.g., [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], [[Finsbury Park]], [[Clapham Common]], [[Kennington Park]], and [[Victoria Park, East London|Victoria Park]]). More recently, they have been set up in other British cities, and there are also Speakers' Corners in other countries.

==Hyde Park==
[[File:Speakers Corner London - a speaker.JPG|thumb|"One world" speaker supporting a [[world government]]]]
[[File:Speaker's Corner Speaker.jpg|thumb|A [[Christian]] speaker at Speakers' Corner (2010)]]

Speakers here may talk on any subject, as long as the police consider their speeches lawful, although this right is not restricted to Speakers' Corner only. Contrary to popular belief, there is no immunity from the law, nor are any subjects proscribed, but in practice the police intervene only when they receive a complaint.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} On some occasions in the past, they have intervened on grounds of [[profanity]].&lt;ref&gt;Huggon, Jim:  Speakers' Corner: An Anthology. London: Kropotkin's Lighthouse Publ. 1977&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though Hyde Park Speakers' Corner is considered the paved area closest to [[Marble Arch]],&lt;ref&gt;Hyde Park Regulation, 1955. Statutory Instruments 1955, No. 1750. Clause 1(1), where the "footway at the junction of the North and East Carriage Drives" is described as "known as Speakers' Corner"&lt;/ref&gt; legally the public speaking area extends beyond the [[Reform Tree]] and covers a large area from Marble Arch to [[Victoria Gate (Hyde Park)|Victoria Gate]], then along [[the Serpentine]] to Hyde Park Corner and the Broad Walk running from Hyde Park Corner to Marble Arch.&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrased from: Hyde Park Regulation, 1955. Statutory Instruments 1955 No. 1750. Clause 1(1), where "the public speaking area" is defined. A 1997 revision of the Regulation has a slightly more restricted definition of the area.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public riots broke out in the park in 1855, in protest over the Sunday Trading Bill, which forbade buying and selling on a Sunday, the only day working people had off. The riots were (rather sanguinely) described by [[Karl Marx]] as the beginning of the English revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Humphreys|first1=Rob|last2=Bamber|first2=Judith|title=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxCN57GotDkC&amp;pg=PA287|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-093-0|pages=287–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement used Hyde Park as a point of assembly for workers' protests, but no permanent speaking location was established. The [[Reform League]] organised a massive [[Reform League#Hyde Park demonstration of 1866|demonstration in 1866]] and then [[Reform League#Hyde Park demonstration of 1867|again in 1867]], which compelled the government to extend the franchise to include most [[working class|working-class]] men.

The riots and agitation for democratic reform encouraged some to force the issue of the "right to speak" in Hyde Park. The Parks Regulation Act 1872 delegated the issue of permitting public meetings to the park authorities (rather than central government). Contrary to popular belief,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} it does not confer a statutory basis for the right to speak at Speakers' Corner. Parliamentary debates on the Act illustrate that a general principle of being able to meet and speak was not the intention, but that some areas would be permitted to be used for that purpose.

Since that time, it has become a traditional site for public speeches and debate, as well as a major site of protest and assembly in Britain. There are some who contend that the tradition has a connection with the [[Tyburn]] gallows, where the condemned man was allowed to speak before being hanged.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Speakers' Corner is often held up to demonstrate [[freedom of speech]], as anyone can turn up unannounced and talk on almost any subject, although always at the risk of being [[heckler|heckled]] by regulars. The corner was frequented by [[Karl Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[George Orwell]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Walter Rodney]], [[Ben Tillett]], [[Marcus Garvey]], [[Kwame Nkrumah]], and [[William Morris]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}  Lord Justice Sedley, in ''[[Redmond-Bate v Director of Public Prosecutions]]'' (1999), described Speakers' Corner as demonstrating "the tolerance which is both extended by the law to opinion of every kind and expected by the law in the conduct of those who disagree, even strongly, with what they hear."  The ruling famously established in English case law that freedom of speech could not be limited to the inoffensive but extended also to "the irritating, the contentious, the eccentric, the heretical, the unwelcome, and the provocative, as long as such speech did not tend to provoke violence", and that the right to free speech accorded by [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 10]] of the [[European Convention of Human Rights]] also accorded the right to be offensive. Prior to the ruling, prohibited speech at Speakers' Corner included [[obscenity]], [[blasphemy]], [[Lèse-majesté|insulting the queen]], or inciting a [[breach of the peace]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Milly|title=It's Speakers' Corner, but not as we know it|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/its-speakers-corner-but-not-as-we-know-it-1346856.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=12 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eibl|first=Ralf|title=London -- Diatribe Alive And Well At Speakers' Corner|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930228&amp;slug=1687918|work=Deutsche Presse Agentur|publisher=The Seattle Times|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=28 February 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, for instance, a combination of park by-laws, use of the Highways Acts and use of venue licensing powers of the [[London County Council]] made it one of the few places where socialist speakers could meet and debate.

==Outside London==

===Official===

====Nottingham====
The first official Speakers' Corner outside London opened in [[Nottingham]] in 2009. It was officially inaugurated by [[Jack Straw]], the UK Justice Secretary, on 22 February 2009. The designated space occupied a new landscaped extension to the city's [[Old Market Square]], at the junction of King Street and Queen Street. The large paved space includes the new statue of [[Brian Clough]], the former manager of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who forged ties between the two cities which were famous for local rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speakerscornertrust.org/speakers-corner-projects/uk-projects/nottingham/|title=Nottingham - Speakers Corner Trust|website=www.SpeakersCornerTrust.org|access-date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lichfield, Staffordshire====

Speakers Corner [[Lichfield]] was launched in May 2009, with the help of the Speakers’ Corner Trust, to much applause. Hundreds of people joined in the celebrations which featured over 30 speeches, musical and dance performances, as well as star appearances from BBC’s Jo Malin and former [[Coronation Street]] Star Chris Walker.

Today Speakers’ Corner is a site for events and activities, as well as a destination for all the community to visit and have their say on topics close to their hearts.

Since the launch, a plaque has been unveiled at the site, along with a code of conduct. Plans for the site include a stone plaque marking the spot, as well as a series of annual events.

====Worthing, West Sussex====
The [[Sussex]] coastal town of [[Worthing]] has had its own Speakers' Corner at Splash Point on the town's seafront since the [[Victorian era]].  A sign today marks the "stand for delivering sermons and public speeches", while another sign close by marks the site by the old Fish Market where the [[Salvation Army]] has preached the Gospel since 1886.  The Speakers' Corner fell into disuse in the late 20th century and is now being reinstated.  As part of the Government's ''Sea Change'' programme, being run by the [[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment]], the area will benefit from a £500,000 grant to re-landscape the area around Splash Point and see a revival of the Speakers' Corner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worthing.gov.uk/news/title,60447,en.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716142005/http://www.worthing.gov.uk/news/title%2C60447%2Cen.html |date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers' corner comprises a dais accessible by steps and a ramp providing a platform from which speakers address the crowd or passers by.&lt;ref name="CPSplashPointDesign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.craftpegg.com/page6sp.html|title=Splash Point Design|year=2009|publisher=Craft:Pegg|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is due for completion by October 2010.&lt;ref name="WBCSplashPointRegeneration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worthing.gov.uk/news/features/splashpointregeneration/|title=Splash Point Regeneration|year=2010|publisher=Worthing Borough Council|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unofficial===

====Leeds====
[[Leeds]] is known to have its own Speakers' Corner, at Victoria Gardens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.speakerscornerleeds.org.uk/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929151606/http://speakerscornerleeds.org.uk/ |archivedate=29 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[the Headrow]], in front of the [[Leeds City Art Gallery]], Central Library and Henry Moore Sculpture Centre building. It is a pivotal point in Leeds for justice and anti-war marches, most of which gather and terminate here, as well as for war memorial services due to the location of Leeds's Municipal Cenotaph.

==Other countries==

===Australia===
There is a Speakers' Corner in [[the Domain]] in [[Sydney]], established in 1878. The speakers talk every Sunday afternoon from 2&amp;nbsp;pm until 5&amp;nbsp;pm, and have a website. Official outdoor "free" speech first appeared in the hustings and hanging grounds of Hyde Park Sydney in 1874. Free speech in this form was banned following a serious riot between Catholics and Orangemen. However, following the formalisation of free speech in Speakers' Corner in London it was decided in 1878 that The Domain would be the place for free speech in Sydney.

In 'Diary of a Voyage to Australia, New Zealand and other lands' (published 1896), Robert Roberts notes that "On the west side [of a particular location] is a feature peculiar to Sydney in all the world - a preaching park. There are of course, parks in other cities where open-air spouting is practiced on Sundays, such as Hyde Park, in London : but there is no city in the world where a park on such a scale is used by all classes of religious people. It is a wooded enclosure, like a nobleman's park in England, kept in capital order, both as regards the turf under foot, and the tall and noble trees that give shelter overhead from the sun."  "All the sects and denominations use it. There is none of the sense of infra dig that associates itself with out-door preaching in England.""Every denomination has its own tree." "The various religious bodies hold their meetings sufficiently apart to make no interference one with the other. It is a sort of weekly babel of religious tongues - recognised and patronised by the whole community"

Other Speakers' Corners are found outside [[Parliament House, Queensland|Parliament House]], in [[King George Square]], and at [[Brisbane Powerhouse|The Powerhouse]] in [[Brisbane]]. In [[Melbourne]], Speakers' Corner was originally held in [[Birrarung Marr]] where the original site is still visible. This site has lost some popularity over the years and Speakers' Corner (Now called "Speakers' Forum") is currently held outside the [[State Library of Victoria]] on Sunday afternoon from 3&amp;nbsp;pm.

===Canada===
[[File:Speakers corner.jpg|thumb|Speakers' Corner in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]]]]
Dedicated by the [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten]] on 12 April 1966, Speakers' Corner in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] is located on the north shore of [[Wascana Centre|Wascana Lake]]. It serves as a constant reminder of the notion of free speech and assembly and a tribute to [[Saskatchewan]] people who have upheld that heritage. The two lanterns framing the south entrance to the main plaza formed part of the Cumberland Screen at the entrance to Speakers' Corner in London. The podia on the main plaza are from the exterior columns of the Old City Hall (1908–1965) and symbolise free speech in democracy at the municipal level of government. Six paper [[birch]] trees were taken from [[Runnymede]] Meadow in [[Windsor Great Park]], near [[Windsor Castle]]. It was there that [[John of England|King John]] signed [[Magna Carta]] on 15 June 1215. The ten gas lamps surrounding the corner come from King Charles Street which runs from Whitehall to St. James Park, London, near the Houses of Parliament.  They were erected in 1908 during the reign of [[Edward VII]], whose [[Royal Cypher|royal cypher]] E.R. VII appears on the base of each lamp.

[[Kitchener, Ontario]] has a small area designated as Speakers' Corner on the northwest corner of King and Frederick Streets. It existed already since the mid-1980s.

=== Indonesia ===
Mass demonstration and speeches are traditionally held on the Hotel Indonesia roundabout [[Selamat Datang Monument]]. This venue however, is located the middle of Jakarta's main boulevard and commercial district, thus causing a severe traffic jam when a rally is held. To accommodate this, Jakarta's provincial government built a small park on the northwestern corner of the [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]], across the [[Istana Merdeka]], Indonesia's presidential palace. Officially named 'Taman Pandang Istana' (Palace-View Park), this park is known commonly as 'Taman Unjuk Rasa' (Demonstration Park).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://travel.detik.com/domestic-destinations/d-3337665/usai-demo-jangan-lupa-berfoto-di-taman-unjuk-rasa-yang-happening|title=Usai Demo, Jangan Lupa Berfoto di Taman Unjuk Rasa yang Happening|last=Prakoso|first=Johanes Randy|work=detikTravel|access-date=2017-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
As a tribute to democracy and freedom of speech, in Lajatico, Pisa there a small area designated as Speakers' Corner ("L'angolo del parlatore") on a corner of the Vittorio Veneto main square. It is opened for the public to speak on Sundays (9 to 11 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m.). The first speaker was the mayor Alessio Barbarfieri, who highlighted the importance of the acts of speaking and listening for a good and effective local governance.

===Malaysia===
The first Speakers' Square in [[Malaysia]] was established at the [[Esplanade, Penang|Esplanade]], [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]] on 4 May 2010. It is opened for the public to speak on Wednesday and Sunday (6.00&amp;nbsp;pm to 10.00&amp;nbsp;pm). The first speaker was Tan Seng Hai who shared his views on preventing Ascot Sports [[Sendirian Berhad|Sdn. Bhd.]] from conducting betting activities in the Penang state.

'''''Conditions for use of Speakers' Square'''''
* All speakers are prohibited from using loudspeakers, megaphones, or any other public address system
* Anyone who uses the Speakers' Square to make speeches does so at his or her own risk
* The Penang State Government and the [[Penang Island City Council|City Council of Penang Island]] will not be responsible for any prosecution or legal action by the Police or civil proceedings

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, there is a permanently designated speakers' corner called the [[Spreeksteen]] in [[Amsterdam]]. Lawfully, every person has the freedom of speech as a matter of right. The 'Spreeksteen' is open for free speech 24-hours a day, and was established to allow complete free speech. The 'Spreeksteen' has been located in the [[Oosterpark (Amsterdam)|Oosterpark]] in Amsterdam since 5 May 2005, and has been erected by a citizens action after the brutal murder of film-maker and columnist [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]]. Plans for bringing the Amsterdam Speakers' Corner online with a permanent camera and microphone are in a phase of installation. In the meantime the speakers are filmed with a hand-held camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spreeksteen.nl |title=Spreeksteen.nl |publisher=Spreeksteen.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spreeksteen was involved in controversy when they allowed [[Michiel Smit]], a far-right activist, to speak on 1 October 2006. [[Antifascism|Antifascist]] demonstrators used noise to prevent Smit from being heard (as happens often when there is a public demonstration of the far-right).

There is a Speakers' Corner in [[Albert Park, Auckland|Albert Park]] in [[Auckland]] at Princes Street, opposite to the [[University of Auckland]].

===Singapore===
{{Main article|Speakers' Corner, Singapore}}
[[File:Deserted Speakers' Corner - Singapore (gabbe).jpg|thumb|left|An empty Speakers' Corner in [[Singapore]]]]

The Speakers' Corner in [[Singapore]] was opened on 1 September 2000, to allow Singapore citizens to speak freely. They are exempted from the need to obtain a police permit as long as they meet the terms and conditions of use.

The Speakers' Corner is located in [[Hong Lim Park]], a popular venue for many election rallies and political speeches in the 1950s and '60s. Hong Lim Park is centrally located, well-served by public transport and is sited in a high public density area.

In 2004, public exhibitions and performances were added to the list of exempted activities at the Speakers' Corner.

From 1 September 2008, Singapore citizens can also organise or participate in demonstrations at Speakers' Corner without having to obtain a police permit. With this latest change in policy to allow the venue to be used freely as an outdoor demonstration site, coupled with the liberalisation on the use of sound amplification and the extension of operating hours of the venue, the Speakers' Corner aims to address the genuine desire by some Singaporeans for lawful outdoor demonstrations and processions as a means of political expression.

Singapore citizens who wish to hold a speech, exhibition/performance or demonstration at the Speakers' Corner can register with the National Parks Board, which manages Hong Lim Park. Online registration is available on the website.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
Woodford Square in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad]], is also known as "The University of Woodford Square", so named by the first prime minister of Trinidad [[Eric Williams]], who gave many speeches here. Another nickname, "People's Parliament", comes from the [[Black Power]] movement of the 1970s.  Flanked by Trinidad's Parliament and Halls of Justice the Square still plays host to speeches of a highly topical and political nature.

In the southeast corner of the square, a blackboard lists the day's discussion as well as other important information. The speakers' topics are divided by interest and known as "classes".

===Thailand===
An area was set up in [[Bangkok]] in the 1930s, and quickly became known as Hyde Park, to enable freedom of speech and the airing of political views in [[Thailand]].  The area was shut down after student rioting and the lethal intervention of the army and it is not discussed openly today.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In 1955, Marshal [[Plaek Pibulsonggram]] had visited London as part of an international tour. He became impressed with the 'Speakers' Corner' in Hyde Park. Upon his return to Thailand a 'Hyde Park' space for free speech and assembly was instituted at the Phramane Grounds in Bangkok. The experiment was well received and effectively stimulated political debate. The experiment was not appreciated by the government though, and in February 1956 restrictions were imposed on the Phramane 'Hyde Park'. However, during this period the Hyde Park Movement Party had evolved, upholding the legacy of the Hyde Park experiment.&lt;ref name="rose181"&gt;Rose, Saul. ''Socialism in Southern Asia''.

=== United States ===
[[File:Elon University USA Speakers Corner.jpg|thumb|[[Elon University]]'s Speakers Corner]]

[[Tom L. Johnson]], the radical reforming Mayor of [[Cleveland]] (1901–1909), dedicated the north-west quadrant of Public Square to Free Speech, as in Hyde Park. Speeches and meetings there were common in the early part of the century; Anarchist Emma Goldman addressed a large crowd there in 1908. Today the site remains the traditional place for rallies and demonstrations in Cleveland, around Mayor Johnson's statue.

The [[History of the University of California, Berkeley#1960s and the Free Speech Movement|University of California at Berkeley]] had a free speech area in front of Sproul Plaza until 1964. [[University_of_Missouri|The University of Missouri]] hosts a Speaker's Corner, referred to as "Speaker's Circle". There are only two such locations in the entire state of Missouri.  

As a result of winter semesters visits to England and Hyde Park, Elon College (now known as [[Elon University]]) created a Speakers' Corner on campus. No persons from outside the university may speak without a permit. Students are free to speak at any time as long as they don't use amplification, do not disrupt others, do not damage property (including the lawn itself) and do not cause dangerous conditions (stakes may not be planted in the ground without the approval of Physical Plant due to electrical/water lines, etc.).

The pedestrian-only area of Pennsylvania Avenue on the north side of the White House in Washington, D.C. has become a de facto speaker's corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-the-white-house-fence-jumper-and-the-consequences-of-budget-cuts/2014/09/22/def1143a-429f-11e4-b437-1a7368204804_story.html|title=Dana Milbank: The White House fence jumper and the consequences of budget cuts|first=Dana|last=Milbank|date=22 September 2014|publisher=|access-date=1 January 2018|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consistent with the principles of the first amendment, ad hoc public speaking is generally legal in all public places in Washington DC, although organized demonstrations require police permits.

[[File:Apostle spoons six.jpg|thumb|A person only has a limited number of "spoons" that are consumed by activities throughout a day]]
The '''spoon theory''' is a [[disability]] [[metaphor]] and [[neologism]] used to explain the reduced amount of energy available for activities of living and productive tasks that may result from disability or [[chronic illness]]. Spoons are a visual representation used as a unit of measure in order to quantify how much energy a person has throughout a given day. Each activity requires a given number of spoons, which will only be replaced as the person "recharges" through rest. A person who runs out of spoons has no choice but to rest until their spoons are replenished.

This metaphor is used to describe the planning that many people have to do to conserve and [[rationing|ration]] their energy reserves to accomplish their activities of daily living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=21 June 2013 |title=Explaining Low Stamina Levels&amp;nbsp;– with Spoons |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-ouch-22972767 |work=BBC Online |access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planning and rationing of energy-consuming tasks has been described as being a major concern of those with chronic and fatigue-related diseases, illness, or conditions. The theory explains the difference between those who don't seem to have energy limits and those that do. The theory is used to facilitate discussions between those with limited energy reserves and those without.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Henderson |first=Wendy |date=29 June 2017 |title=Explaining Chronic Illness: An Alternative to the Spoon Theory |url=https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/2017/06/29/explaining-chronic-illness-alternative-spoon-theory/ |website=Multiple Sclerosis News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miserandino&gt;{{cite web |last=Miserandino |first=Christine |year=2003 |title=The Spoon Theory |url=https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/ |website=But You Don't Look Sick |access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because healthy people typically are not concerned with the energy expended during ordinary tasks such as bathing and getting dressed, the theory helps healthy people realize the amount of energy expended by chronically ill or disabled people to get through the day.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web |last=Band |first=Emily |date=24 September 2012 |title=How the Spoon Theory Helps Those Suffering Chronic Pain and Fatigue |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/24/spoon-theory-chronic-pain-fatigue |website=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spoons are widely discussed within autoimmune, disability, mental and other chronic illness online communities,{{sfnm |1a1=Alhaboby |1a2=Barnes |1a3=Evans |1a4=Short |1y=2017 |1p=6 |2a1=Alhaboby |2a2=Barnes |2a3=Evans |2a4=Short |2y=2018 |2p=177}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hess |first=Amanda |author-link=Amanda Hess |date=4 March 2016 |title=The Social Media Cure: How People with Chronic Illnesses Use Memes, Selfies, and Emojis to Soothe Their Suffering |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2016/03/how_spoonies_people_with_chronic_illnesses_use_memes_selfies_and_emojis.html |website=Slate |access-date=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an [[emic]] descriptor.{{sfn|Gonzalez-Polledo|2016|p=5}} The term ''spoonie'' is sometimes used to refer to a person with a chronic illness that can be explained with the spoon theory.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;{{sfn|Gonzalez-Polledo|2016|p=5}}

== Origin ==
The term ''spoons'' was coined by Christine Miserandino in 2003 in her essay "The Spoon Theory".{{sfnm |1a1=Alhaboby |1a2=Barnes |1a3=Evans |1a4=Short |1y=2018 |1p=177 |2a1=Conrad |2y=2017 |2p=84}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Werber |first=Cassie |date=31 July 2017 |title=Spoons Have Become a Powerful Symbol of People's Invisible Pain |url=https://qz.com/1042347/what-is-the-spoon-theory-paris-jackson-and-macaulay-culkins-spoon-tattoos-are-a-powerful-symbol-of-invisible-pain/ |website=Quartz |access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay describes a conversation between Miserandino and a friend.{{sfn|Alhaboby|Barnes|Evans|Short|2018|p=177}} The discussion was initiated by a question from the friend in which she asked about what having [[lupus]] feels like. The essay then describes the actions of Miserandino who took spoons from nearby tables to use as a [[visual aid]]. She handed her friend twelve spoons and asked her to describe the events of a typical day, taking a spoon away for each activity. In this way, she demonstrated that her spoons, or units of energy, must be [[rationing|rationed]] to avoid running out before the end of the day. Miserandino also asserted that it is possible to exceed one's daily limit, but that doing so means borrowing from the future and may result in not having enough spoons the next day. Miserandino suggested the spoon theory can describe the effects of mental illnesses as well.&lt;ref name=Miserandino/&gt;

According to the spoon theory, spoons (units of energy) may be replaced after rest or a night of sleep. However, people with [[chronic diseases]], such as [[autoimmune disease]]s, and various [[disability|disabilities]] may have sleep difficulties. This can result in a particularly low supply of energy.{{sfn|Lashley|2003}} Some disabled people may not be fatigued by the disabilities themselves, but by the constant effort required to [[Passing (sociology)|pass]] as non-disabled.{{sfn|Brune|Wilson|2013}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6380">The '''temporal theory''' of [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] states that human perception of sound depends on [[Time|temporal]] patterns with which [[neurons]] respond to [[sound]] in the [[cochlea]]. Therefore, in this theory, the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of a [[pure tone]] is determined by the period of neuron firing patterns—either of single neurons, or groups as described by the [[volley theory]]. Temporal or '''timing theory''' competes with the [[place theory (hearing)|place theory]] of hearing, which instead states that pitch is signaled according to the locations of vibrations along the [[basilar membrane]].

Temporal theory was first suggested by [[August Seebeck]].

==Description==

As the basilar membrane vibrates, each clump of [[hair cell]]s along its length is deflected in time with the sound components as filtered by [[basilar membrane]] tuning for its position. The more intense this vibration is, the more the hair cells are deflected and the more likely they are to cause [[cochlear nerve]] firings. Temporal theory supposes that the consistent timing patterns, whether at high or low average firing rate, code for a consistent pitch percept.

==High amplitudes==

At high sounds levels, [[nerve fiber]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s whose characteristic frequencies do not exactly match the stimulus still respond, because of the motion induced in larger areas of the basilar membrane by loud sounds. Temporal theory can help explain how we maintain this discrimination. Even when a larger group of nerve fibers are all firing, there is a periodicity to this firing, which corresponds to the periodicity of the stimulus.

==High frequencies==

Neurons have a maximum firing frequency within the range of frequencies we can hear. To be complete, rate theory must somehow explain how we distinguish pitches above this maximum firing rate. The [[volley theory]], in which groups of neurons cooperate to code the temporal pattern, is an attempt to make the temporal theory more complete, but some frequencies are too high to see any synchrony in the [[cochlear nerve]] firings.

===The random firing solution===

Beament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = James Beament | title = How We Hear Music | publisher = The Boydell Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-85115-813-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined a potential solution. He noted that in two classic studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Nelson Y. S. Kiang | title = Discharge Patterns of Single Auditory Fibers | publisher = MIT Research Monograph 35 | year = 1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J. J. Rose |author2=J. Hind |author3=D. Anderson |author4=J. Brugge  |last-author-amp=yes | title = Response of Auditory Fibers in the Squirrel Monkey | journal = J. Neurophysiol. | volume = 30 | year = 1967 | pages = 769–793 | pmid = 4962851 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual hair cell neurons did not always fire at the first moment they were able to. Though they would fire in time with the vibrations, the neurons would not fire on every vibration. The number of skipped vibrations was seemingly random. The gaps in the resulting train of neural impulses would then all be integer multiples of the period of vibration. For example, a pure tone of 100&amp;nbsp;Hz has a period of 10 ms. The corresponding train of impulses would contain gaps of 10 ms, 20 ms, 30 ms, 40 ms, etc. Such a group of gaps can only be generated by a 100&amp;nbsp;Hz tone. The set of gaps for a sound above the maximum neural firing rate would be similar except it would be missing some of the initial gaps, however it would still uniquely correspond to the frequency. The pitch of a pure tone could then be seen as corresponding to the difference between adjacent gaps.

===Another solution===

Modern research suggests that the perception of pitch depends on both the places and patterns of neuron firings. [[Place theory (hearing)|Place theory]] may be dominant for higher frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Pitch Perception Models | author = Alain de Cheveigné | title = Pitch |editor1=Christopher J. Plack |editor2=Andrew J. Oxenham |editor3=Richard R. Fay |editor4=Arthur N. Popper | publisher = Birkhäuser | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-387-23472-1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=n6VdlK3AQykC&amp;pg=PT214&amp;dq=place+pitch++volley+theory++believed }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also suggested that place theory may be dominant for low, resolved frequency harmonics,
and that t[[Temporal theory|emporal theory]] may be dominant for high, unresolved frequency harmonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shackleton|first1=Trevor M.|last2=Carlyon|first2=Robert|title=The role of resolved and unresolved harmonics in pitch perception and frequency modulation discrimination|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date=1994|volume=95|issue=6|pages=3529|doi=10.1121/1.409970|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/95/6/10.1121/1.409970|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments to distinguish rate and place effects on pitch perception==

Experiments to distinguish between place theory and rate theory using subjects with normal hearing are difficult to devise, because of the strong correlation between rate and place: large vibrations at a low rate are produced at the apical end of the [[basilar membrane]] while large vibrations at a high rate are produced at the basal end. The two stimulus parameters can, however, be controlled independently using [[cochlear implant]]s: pulses with a range of rates can be applied via different pairs of electrodes distributed along the membrane and subjects can be asked to rate a stimulus on a pitch scale.

Experiments using implant recipients (who had previously had normal hearing) showed that, at stimulation rates below about 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, ratings on a pitch scale were proportional to the [[Logarithm|log]] of stimulation rate, but also decreased with distance from the round window. At higher rates, the effect of rate became weaker, but the effect of place was still strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fearn R, Carter P, Wolfe J |title=The perception of pitch by users of cochlear implants: possible significance for rate and place theories of pitch |journal=Acoustics Australia |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=41–43 |year=1999 | url=http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/Fearnetal.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hollow Earth==
{{Main|Hollow Earth}}
The idea of a so-called "[[Hollow Earth]]", once popular in fantasy adventure literature, is that the planet [[Earth]] has a hollow interior and an inner surface habitable by human beings.  Although the scientific community has made clear that this is [[pseudoscience]], the idea nevertheless is a less popular feature of many [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] stories and of some [[conspiracy theories]].

==In science fiction==
The most famous example of a hollow-Earth fantasy is [[Jules Verne]]'s 1864 science-fiction novel ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', which has been adapted many times as a feature film and for television.

The 2003 film ''[[The Core]]'', loosely based on the novel ''[[Core (novel)|Core]]'', tells the story of a team that has to drill to the center of the Earth and detonate a series of nuclear explosions in order to restart the rotation of Earth's core. The drilling equipment, dubbed ''Virgil'', includes a powerful, snake-like laser drill, a small nuclear reactor for power, a shell (of "[[unobtainium]]", a fictional material) to protect against intense heat and pressure (and generate energy to drive the engine), a powerful [[X-ray vision|x-ray camera]] for viewing outside, and a system of impellers for movement and control. The only part of the Earth that turns out to be hollow is a gigantic [[geode]], and soon after the drill moves through it, the hole it created fills with magma.

The 1986 animated television show [[Inhumanoids]] featured regular visits to the Inner Core in most of its 13 episodes. Each of the three villainous creatures theoretically ruled over certain layers of the inner earth, and their evil schemes were thwarted by the human Earth Corps, who often allied with various races of subterranean beings equally threatened by the Inhumanoids.

During season 3 of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' cartoon]], the [[Technodrome]] is located at the Earth's core, and transport modules are used to drill up to the streets. This season also features the episode "Turtles at the Earth's Core", where a dinosaur lives in a deep cave, and a crystal of energy that works like the [[Sun]] to keep the dinosaurs alive.
As [[Krang]], [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]], [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] steal the crystal to power the Technodrome, the trouble begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-1987/turtles-at-the-earths-core-67177/|title=Turtles at the Earth's Core|publisher=[[TV.com]]|date=1 November 1989|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Rosa]]'s 1995 ''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' story ''[[The Universal Solvent (comics)|The Universal Solvent]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Solvent|url=http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=D+94066|website=coa.inducks.org|ref=Inducks}}&lt;/ref&gt; imagines a way to travel to the planet's core using 1950s technology, although this would be impossible in reality. The fictional solvent referred to in the story's title has the power to condense everything except diamonds into a kind of super-dense dust. The solvent is accidentally spilled and, as it dissolves everything in its path, it bores a cylindrical shaft into the center of the planet. As part of a recovery effort, a makeshift platform is constructed that descends into the shaft in [[free fall]], automatically deploying an electric motor and wheels as it approaches [[Weightlessness#Zero gravity|zero gravity]], then using rocket engines to enable it to ascend again to the Earth's surface. The author Rosa describes this fantasy journey in great detail: the supposed structure of the Earth is illustrated, and the shaft is kept in a [[vacuum]] to protect against the lethal several thousand kilometers of atmosphere that it would otherwise be exposed to. The ducks must wear [[space suit]]s and go without food for several days, and they are not entirely certain that the super-dense [[heat shield]] will hold. The author maintains continuity with [[Carl Barks]], explaining that the earthquakes in the story are created by spherical Fermies and Terries.

In [[Tales to Astonish]] #2 (1959) "I Fell to the Center of the Earth", an archaeologist named Dr. Burke who is on an expedition to Asia travels to the center of the Earth (and also, as he later finds out, backwards in time)--and encounters [[neanderthals]] and [[dinosaurs]].

In the [[Doctor Who]] episode, ''[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]'', a Racnoss warship is found at the center of the planet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4321">'''Trial by media''' is a phrase popular in the late 20th century and early 21st century to describe the impact of [[television]] and [[newspaper]] coverage on a person's reputation by creating a widespread perception of guilt or innocence before, or after, a verdict in a court of law. Its first inception was the phrase ''Trial by Television'' which found light in the response to the 3 February, 1967 television broadcast of [[The Frost Programme]], host [[David Frost]]. The confrontation and Frost's [[Emil_Savundra#Frost_Programme_controversy|personal adversarial line of questioning]] of insurance fraudster [[Emil Savundra]] led to concern from [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] executives that it might affect Savundra's right to a fair trial.

==Description==
During high-publicity court cases, the media are often accused of provoking an atmosphere of public hysteria akin to a [[Lynching|lynch mob]] which not only makes a fair trial nearly impossible but means that regardless of the result of the trial the accused will not be able to live the rest of their life without intense public scrutiny.

The counter-argument is that the [[mob mentality]] exists independently of the media which merely voices the opinions which the public already has.

Although a recently coined phrase, the idea that [[mass media|popular media]] can have a strong influence on the legal process goes back certainly to the advent of the printing press and probably much further.{{OR|date=February 2013}} This is not including the use of a state controlled press to criminalize political opponents, but in its commonly understood meaning covers all occasions where the reputation of a person has been drastically affected by ostensibly non-political publications.

Often the coverage in the press can be said to reflect the views of the person in the street. However, more credibility is generally given to printed material than 'water cooler gossip'. The responsibility of the press to confirm reports and leaks about individuals being tried has come under increasing scrutiny and journalists are calling for higher standards. There was much debate over U.S President [[Bill Clinton]]'s impeachment trial and prosecutor [[Kenneth Starr]]'s investigation and how the media handled the trial by reporting commentary from lawyers which influenced public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal News: News Hour with Jim Lehrer|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/spc/bb/media/july-dec98/lawyers_10-19a.html|publisher=Public Broadcasting System (PBS)|accessdate=12 March 2011|format=Transcript|date=19 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, strict [[Contempt of court#England|contempt of court]] regulations restrict the media's reporting of legal proceedings after a person is formally arrested.  These rules are designed so that a defendant receives a fair trial in front of a jury that has not been tainted by prior media coverage.  The newspapers the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' have been prosecuted under these regulations, although such prosecutions are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|title=Contempt of court rules are designed to avoid trial by media|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/jul/05/contempt-court-rules-trial-media|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benfleet Sewage Treatment Plant, Filter Bed - geograph.org.uk - 1450096.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|A trickling filter plant in the [[United Kingdom]]: The effluent from the primary settling tanks is sprayed onto a bed of coarse gravel (Benfleet Sewage Treatment Plant)]]

A '''trickling filter''' is a type of [[wastewater treatment]] system. It consists of a fixed bed of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s, [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[gravel]], [[slag]], [[polyurethane]] [[foam]], sphagnum [[peat moss]], [[porous media|ceramic]], or plastic media over which [[sewage]] or other [[wastewater]] flows  downward and causes a layer of [[microbial]] slime ([[biofilm]]) to grow, covering the bed of media. [[Wikt:aerobic|Aerobic]] conditions are maintained by splashing, diffusion, and either by [[forced-air]] flowing through the bed or natural convection of air if the filter medium is porous.

The terms '''trickle filter''', '''trickling biofilter''', '''biofilter''', '''biological filter''' and '''biological trickling filter''' are often used to refer to a '''trickling filter'''. These systems have also been described as roughing filters, intermittent filters, packed media bed filters, alternative septic systems, percolating filters, attached growth processes, and fixed film processes.

Typically, sewage flow enters at a high level and flows through the primary settlement tank. The supernatant from the tank flows into a dosing device, often a tipping bucket which delivers flow to the arms of the filter. The flush of water flows through the arms and exits through a series of holes pointing at an angle downwards. This propels the arms around distributing the liquid evenly over the surface of the filter media.
Most are uncovered (unlike the accompanying diagram) and are freely ventilated to the atmosphere.

The removal of [[pollution|pollutants]] from the waste water stream involves both [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] and [[adsorption]] of [[organic compounds]]  and some inorganic species such as [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]] ions by the layer of microbial [[bio film]].  The filter media is typically chosen to provide a very high surface area to volume. Typical materials are often porous and have considerable internal surface area in addition to the external surface of the medium.  Passage of the waste water over the media provides dissolved [[oxygen]] which the bio-film layer requires for the [[biochemical]] [[oxidation]] of the organic compounds and releases [[carbon dioxide]] gas, water and other oxidized end products. As the bio film layer thickens, it  eventually sloughs off  into the liquid flow and subsequently forms part of the secondary  sludge. Typically, a trickling filter is followed by a [[clarifier]] or [[sedimentation tank]] for the separation and removal of the sloughed film.  Other filters utilizing higher-density media such as sand, foam and peat moss do not produce a sludge that must be removed, but require forced air blowers and backwashing or an enclosed anaerobic environment.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Biofilm===
The bio-film that develops in a trickling filter may become several millimetres thick and is typically a gelatinous matrix that contains many species of [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[cilliate]]s and [[amoeba|amoeboid]] protozoa, [[annelid]]s, [[Nematode|round worm]]s and insect larvae and many other micro fauna. This is very different from many other bio-films which may be less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Within the thickness of the biofilm both aerobic and anaerobic zones can exist supporting both oxidative and reductive biological processes. At certain times of year, especially in the spring, rapid growth of organisms in the film may cause the film to be too thick and it may slough off in patches leading to the "spring slough".&lt;ref name="staffuni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staffs.ac.uk/schools/sciences/consultancy/dladmin/zCIWEMWWT/Activity5/act5.html|title=Municipal Wastewater Treatment Unit|publisher=Staffordshire University|access-date=19 February 2016}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design considerations==

A typical trickling filter is circular and between 10 metres and 20 metres across and between 2 metres to 3 metres deep. A circular wall, often of brick, contains a bed of filter media which in turn rests on a base of under-drains. These under-drains function both to remove liquid passing through the filter media but also to allow the free passage of air up through the filter media. Mounted in the center over the top of the filter media is a spindle supporting two or more horizontal perforated pipes which extend to the edge of the media. The perforations on the pipes are designed to allow an even flow of liquid over the whole area of the media and are also angled so that when liquid flows from the pipes the whole assembly rotates around the central spindle.&lt;ref name ="staffuni"/&gt; Settled sewage is delivered to a reservoir at the centre of the spindle via some form of dosing mechanism, often a tipping bucket device on small filters.

Larger filters may be rectangular and the distribution arms may be driven by hydraulic or electrical systems.&lt;ref name ="staffuni"/&gt;

==Types==
Single trickling filters may be used for the treatment of small residential septic tank discharges and very small rural sewage treatment systems. Larger centralized sewage treatment plants typically use many trickling filters in parallel.

Systems can be configured for single-pass use where the treated water is applied to the trickling filter once before being disposed of, or for multi-pass use where a portion of the treated water is cycled back and re-treated via a [[Feedback|closed loop]].  Multi-pass systems result in higher treatment quality and assist in removing Total Nitrogen (TN) levels by promoting [[nitrification]] in the aerobic media bed and [[denitrification]] in the anaerobic septic tank. Some systems use the filters in two banks operated in series so that the wastewater has two passes through a filter with a sedimentation stage between the two passes. Every few days the filters are switched round to balance the load. This method of treatment can improve nitrification and de-nitrification since much of the carbonaceous oxidative material is removed on the first pass through the filters.

=== Media types ===
Trickling may have a variety of types of filter media used to support the biofilm. Types of media most commonly used include [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[pumice]], plastic matrix material, open-cell [[polyurethane]] [[foam]], clinker, gravel, [[sand]] and [[geotextiles]].  Ideal filter medium optimizes [[surface area]] for microbial attachment, wastewater retention time, allows air flow, resists plugging is mechanically robust in all weathers allowing walking access across the filter and does not degrade.  Some residential systems require forced aeration units which will increase maintenance and operational costs.

===Industrial wastewater treatment===

The treatment of industrial wastewater may involve specialized trickling filters which use plastic media and high flow rates. Wastewaters from a variety of industrial processes have been treated in trickling filters. Such industrial wastewater trickling filters consist of two types:

* Large tanks or concrete enclosures filled with plastic packing or other media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/CE/msaleh/ChE%20107.11March06.ppt King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Course ChE 101.11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728064144/http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/CE/msaleh/ChE%20107.11March06.ppt |date=2011-07-28 }} Saudi Aramco Engineering Development Program, pages 62-65 including Figure 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vertical towers filled with plastic packing or other media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT4351729&amp;id=U3c8AAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=trickle+filter+%22packed+tower%22+wastewater Biological filter and process] U.S. patent 4,351,729, September 28, 1982, Assigned to Celanese Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.auburn.edu/~davisda/classes/facilities/presentations/Recirc_overview.pdf Lecture] by Dr. Allen Davis, [[Auburn University]], page 6 of 8 pdf pages including schematic of packed tower trickling filter){{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of inexpensive plastic tower packings has led to their use as trickling filter beds in tall towers, some as high as 20 meters.&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R. |title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]]| edition=1st| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|year=1967|lccn=67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 1960s, such towers were in use at: the Great Northern Oil's [[Pine Bend Refinery]] in [[Minnesota]]; the Cities Service Oil Company Trafalgar Refinery in [[Oakville, Ontario]] and at a kraft paper mill.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Bryan and D.H. Moeller, ''Aerobic Biological Oxidation Using Dowpac'', Paper 42, Conference on Biological Waste Treatment, Manhattan College, April 20, 1960. [http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~alleman]&lt;/ref&gt;

The treated water effluent from industrial wastewater trickling filters is typically processed in a clarifier to remove the sludge that sloughs off the microbial slime layer attached to the trickling filter media as for other trickling filter applications.

Some of the latest trickle filter technology involves aerated biofilters of  plastic media in vessels using blowers to inject air at the bottom of the vessels, with either downflow or upflow of the wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcus Van Sperling|title= Activated Sludge and Aerobic Biofilm Reactors|edition= |publisher =IWA Publications|year=2007|isbn=1-84339-165-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Upcycling''', also known as '''creative reuse''', is the process of transforming by-products, waste materials, useless, or unwanted products into new materials or products of better quality or for better environmental value.

Upcycling is the opposite of [[downcycling]], which is the other face of the [[recycling]] process. Downcycling involves converting materials and products into new materials of lesser quality. Most recycling involves converting or extracting useful materials from a product and creating a different product or material.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web | title=Recycling| url=http://blumarble.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Recycling.pdf| website=Environmental Protection Agency| accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''downcycling'' was first used in print in an article in SalvoNEWS by Thornton Kay quoting Reiner Pilz and published in 1994. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.salvoweb.com/files/sn99sm24y94tk181119.pdf Thornton Kay, Salvo in Germany - Reiner Pilz, p14 SalvoNEWS No99 11 October 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We talked about the impending EU Demolition Waste Streams directive. "Recycling," he said, "I call it downcycling. They smash bricks, they smash everything. What we need is upcycling, where old products are given more value, not less." He despairs of the German situation and recalls the supply of a large quantity of reclaimed woodblock from an English supplier for a contract in Nuremberg, while just down the road a load of similar block was scrapped. In the road outside his premises was the result of the Germans' demolition "waste" recycling. It was a pinky looking aggregate with pieces of handmade brick, old tiles, and discernible parts of useful old items mixed with crushed concrete. Is this the future for Europe?}}

''Upsizing'' was the title of the German edition of a book about upcycling first published in English in 1998 by [[Gunter Pauli]] and given the revised title of ''Upcycling'' in 1999. The German edition was adapted to the German language and culture by Johannes F. Hartkemeyer, then Director of the [[Volkshochschule]] in [[Osnabrück]]. The concept was later incorporated by [[William McDonough]] and [[Michael Braungart]] in their 2002 book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]''. They state that the goal of upcycling is to prevent wasting potentially useful materials by making use of existing ones. This reduces the consumption of new [[raw materials]] when creating new products. Reducing the use of new raw materials can result in a reduction of energy usage, [[air pollution]], [[water pollution]] and even [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.

This is a significant step towards regenerative design culture where the end products are cleaner, healthier, and usually have a better value than the material inputs.

For example, during the recycling process of plastics other than those used to create bottles, many different types of plastics are mixed, resulting in a hybrid. This hybrid is used in the manufacturing of plastic lumber applications.  However, unlike the engineered polymer ABS which hold properties of several plastics well, recycled plastics suffer phase-separation that causes structural weakness in the final product.

In 2009, Belinda Smith from Reuters wrote that upcycling had increased in the rich countries but observed that upcycling was a necessity in poorer ones: &lt;blockquote&gt;Supporters of the [[environmentally friendly]] practice of upcycling say people in developing countries have effectively been upcycling for years, using old packaging and clothing in new ways, although more out of need than for the environment. But upcycling is now taking off in other countries, reflecting an increased interest in [[Sustainable products|eco-friendly products]], particularly ones that are priced at an affordable level and proving profitable for the manufacturers. "If upcycling is going to become mainstream, then the corporate world needs to see that it can be profitable," said Albe Zakes, spokesman of U.S. company TerraCycle which specializes in finding new uses for discarded packaging. A growing number of companies are focusing on upcycling although the trend is still in its infancy with industry-wide figures yet to be produced.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldsmith|first=Belinda|date=2009-09-30|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/smallBusinessNews/idUSTRE58T3HX20090930|title=Trash or Treasure? Upcycling Becomes Growing Green Trend|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upcycling has shown significant growth across the United States. For example, the number of products on [[Etsy]] or [[Pinterest]] tagged with the word "upcycled" increased from about 7,900 in January 2010 to nearly 30,000 a year later—an increase of 275%.&lt;ref name="Entrepreneur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/219310  |title=Upcycling Becomes a Treasure Trove for Green Business Ideas |website=[[Entrepreneur Magazine]] |date=March 22, 2011 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013|04}}, that number stood at 263,685, an additional increase of 879%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southernminn.com/faribault_daily_news/news/article_a8276afa-e288-50f3-8573-203e788f9366.html|title=Upcycle trend hits Faribault area|website=Southernminn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Material [[downcycling]] occurs when it is not economic to restore materials to their original quality, for example, when wrought aluminium alloys are melted to produce lower-grade casting alloys.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullen|first=Jonathan|date=2017|title=Circular Economy: Theoretical Benchmark or Perpetual Motion Machine?|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=483–486|doi=10.1111/jiec.12599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Material ''upcycling'', in the thermodynamic sense, is only possible if even more energy is added to upgrade the material quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two guiding questions to ask when assessing recovering for waste materials or products are: How much energy is required to restore the recovered material back to the desired material or product?, and, How does this quantity compare with obtaining the desired material or product from virgin or primary sources? In some cases, little energy is required to reuse a discarded product, for example, secondhand clothing. In other cases, the energy required to recover the materials is more than the energy required to process virgin material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the last case, ''upcycling'' may be considered worst for environmental emissions strategies if energy comes from fossil fuels.

[[File:Vorwarts! (Go Forward!), 1897 F.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Johann Dieter Wassmann (Jeff Wassmann), ''Vorwarts! (Go Forward!)'', 1897]]
[[File:צעצוע נגרר דרום הר חברון.jpg|thumb|A toy from Southern [[Mount Hebron]], on loan to [[Israel Museum]] from a private collection]]

The tradition of reusing [[found objects]] (''objet trouvé'') in mainstream art came of age sporadically through the 20th century, although it has long been a means of production in [[folk art]].  The [[Amish]] [[quilt]], for example, came about through reapplication of salvaged fabric. [[Simon Rodia]]'s [[Watts Towers]] (1921–1954) in [[Los Angeles]] exemplifies upcycling of scrap metal, pottery and broken glass on a grand scale; it consists of 17 structures, the tallest reaching over 30 meters into the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] skyline.

Intellectually, upcycling bears some resemblance to the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|ready-made]] art of [[Marcel Duchamp]] and the [[Dadaists]].  Duchamp's "[[Bicycle Wheel]]" (1913), a front wheel and fork attached to a common stool, is among the earliest of these works, while "[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]" (1917), a common urinal purchased at a hardware store, is arguably his best-known work.  Pablo Picasso's "[[Bull's Head]]" (1942), a sculpture made from a discarded bicycle saddle and handlebars, is the Spanish painter's sly nod to the Dadaists.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Eric, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703551304576261042931202326 "A Magical Metamorphosis of the Ordinary"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', April 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the mid-century the artist [[Joseph Cornell]] fabricated collages and boxed [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] works from old books, found objects and [[ephemera]]. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] collected trash and disused objects, first in Morocco and later on the streets of New York, to incorporate into his art works.

The idea of consciously raising the inherent value of recycled objects as a political statement, however, rather than presenting recycled objects as a reflection or outcome from the means of production, is largely a late 20th century concept. [[Romuald Hazoumé]], an artist from the [[West Africa]]n [[Bénin]], was heralded in 2007 for his use of discarded plastic gasoline and fuel canisters to resemble traditional African masks at [[Documenta]] 12 in [[Kassel]], [[Germany]].  Hazoumé has said of these works, "I send back to the West that which belongs to them, that is to say, the refuse of consumer society that invades us every day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caacart.com/pigozzi-artist.php?i=Hazoume-Romuald&amp;m=35|title=Romuald Hazoumé|website=Contemporary African Art Collection – The Pigozzi Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Wassmann]], an American artist who has lived in Australia for the past 25 years, uses items found on beaches and junk stores in his travels to create the early Modern works of a fictional German relative, [[Johann Dieter Wassmann]] (1841–1898).  In "''Vorwarts'' (Go Forward)" (pictured), Wassmann uses four simple objects to depict a vision of modern man on the precarious eave of the 20th century: an early optometry chart as background, a [[clock spring]] as eye, a 19th-century Chinese bone opium spoon from the Australian gold fields as nose and an upper set of [[dentures]] found on an Australian beach as mouth.  Wassmann is unusual among artists in that he does not sell his work, rather they are presented as gifts; by not allowing these works to re-enter the consumer cycle, he averts the [[commodification]] of his end product.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Ashley, [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/09/1065676092105.html "Hoax Most Perfect"], ''The Age'', October 11, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Zorn (artist)|Max Zorn]] is a Dutch tape artist who creates artwork from ordinary brown packaging tape and hangs pieces on street lamps as a new form of [[street art]] at night. By adding and subtracting layers of tape on [[acrylic glass]] with a surgical scalpel, the artwork can only be visible when light is placed behind it, mimicking the effects similar to [[stained glass]] window methods. His technique with pioneering upcycling with street art has been featured at Frei-Cycle 2013, the first design fair for recycling and upcycling in [[Freiburg]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designmesse für Recycling &amp; Upcycling|url=http://frei-cycle.de/|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent example is the [[Recycled Orchestra of Cateura]] in [[Paraguay]], created in 2006 by the program '''[http://www.sonidosdelatierra.org.py/ Sounds of the Earth]''', directed by [[Luis Szaran]]. The instruments of the orchestra are made from materials taken from the landfill of [[Asunción]], whose name comes from the [[Cateura]] lagoon in the area.

== In industry ==
Many industrial processes, like plastic and electronic fabrication, rely on the consumption of finite resources.&lt;ref name="Upcycling wastes"&gt;Martin, M. and Parsapour, A. 2012. "Upcycling wastes with biogas production : An exergy and economic analysis".

INDUSTRIAL UPCYCLING is new complex methodology for waste prevention. In late 2015 on logistics conference LOGISTICS RIDE, Ostrava, Czech Republic, it was named for the first time INDUSTRY 5.0. It consist of tools and methods streamlining the production surplus from one process or factory to next one. The originator of the complex methodology is Michael Rada, who started successful implementation within Czech republic industrial environment and expand to other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Sung|first1=K.|last2=Cooper|first2=T.|last3=Kettley|first3=S.|date=2014|title=Individual Upcycling Practice: Exploring the Possible Determinants of Upcycling Based on a Literature Review|location=Copenhagen|conference=Sustainable Innovation 2014 Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In consumer electronics, the process of re-manufacturing or [[Refurbishment (electronics)|refurbishment]] of second-hand products can be seen as upcycling because of the reduced energy and material consumption in contrast to new manufacturing. The re-manufactured product has a higher value than disposing or downcycling it.&lt;ref name="remanufacturing"&gt;Steinhilper, R. and Hieber, M. 2001. "Remanufacturing-the key solution for transforming downcycling into upcycling of electronics". ''Electronics and the Environment'', 2001. Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE International Symposium on (2001), 161–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[Brewer's spent grain]], a waste product of [[brewing]] processes, as a [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] in [[biogas]] processes eliminates the need for disposal and can generate significant profit to the overall brewing process. Depending on the substrate's price, a profit of approximately 20% of the operational costs is possible. In this process, the biogas plant acts as an "upcycler".&lt;ref name="Upcycling wastes" /&gt;

== In libraries ==
[[File:Upcycled Roses.jpg|thumb|Roses made from upcycled library books.]]

As libraries are becoming more than just bricks, mortar and their collections, modern librarians are increasing their programming efforts. Upcycle programs or classes/clubs are becoming more and more popular, especially with the help of [[Pinterest]]. The Titusville Public Library has an upcycle class that started out by making roses.

An organization called ScrapDC&lt;ref&gt;[http://scrapdc.org/about/what-we-are/ About ScrapDC]{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; led Upcycle classes at the [[District of Columbia Public Library]], more specifically their [[Southeast Neighborhood Library]]. One of their more popular projects was turning old books into boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dclibrary.org/node/45020|title=Books, Upcycling, and 3-D Printing: Crafting for the Modern Age!|date=10 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jerry Falwell Library]] at [[Liberty University]] holds an annual Creative Upcycling Contest for their students. The first contest had 44 submissions of “Art Made from Books”. These submissions were three-dimensional upcycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty.edu/news/index.cfm?PID=18495&amp;MID=131771|title=Students transform books into 3D art in library upcycling contest – Liberty University|website=www.liberty.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== With food ==
Billions of pounds of food are wasted every year around the world, but there are good ways that people reuse the food and find a way to upcycle. A way that is used very often is to feed it to animals because a lot of animals, such as a pig, will eat all the scraps given. Food waste can be donated and restaurants can save all the food customers don't eat. Donations can also be made by contacting local agricultural extension offices to find out where to donate food waste and telling them how often and how much you can donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/reduce-wasted-food-feeding-animals|title=Reduce wasted food by feeding animals|website=epa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of upcycling food would be to break it down and use it as energy. Engineers have found a way to break the food down into a reusable bio-fuel by pressure cooking it and then they are able to make methane out of the remains which can be used to produce a lot of electricity and heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/industrial-uses-wasted-food|title=Industrial uses for wasted food|website=epa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the food isn't used in those ways, another way is to just break it down and use it in compost, which will improve the soil. Pretty much any type of food waste, such as fruits, vegetables, egg shells, nuts, and nut shells, can be used in compost to make it richer soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/reducing-impact-wasted-food-feeding-soil-and-composting|title=reducing the impact of wasted food by feeding the soil and composting|website=epa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In design processes ==
Tonnes of wastes are produced every day in our cities, and some educators are attempting to raise citizens' awareness, especially the youth. To redefine the concept of recycling previously confined to trash categorization, groups of young designers have attempted to transform "trash" into potentially marketable products such as backpacks made of waste plastic bags&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.up-fuse.com/|title=Up-Fuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kubrick.com.hk/index.php/zh_hk/9789889891329.html|title=Kubrick Web Shop}}&lt;/ref&gt; and area rugs created by reusing hides&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://upcyclerefinery.com/about/|title=What We Do – Upcycle Refinery|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One relevant book published by Community Museum Project in [[Hong Kong]] in 2010, was the first experiment on upcycling systems design.  Spanning across material collecting, upcycling design, local production and public dissemination, it provides proposals towards a sustainable system that will cast impact on our strategies of waste handling and energy saving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/supplement/culture/art/20130323/18204240|title=升級再造3：廢物‧迷思|website=Apple Daily 蘋果日報|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong Kong local inventor [[Gary Chan (inventor)|Gary Chan]] is actively involved in designing and making 'upcycling' bikes by making use of waste materials as parts for his bikes. He invented at least 8 bikes using wastes as a majority of the materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metropop.com.hk/contents/425/green/1484/|title=土炮發明王|date=2014-10-16|website=www.metropop.com.hk|language=zh-HK|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yp.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/92828/gary-chan-bad-boy-bicycle-building-hong-kong|title=Gary Chan is the bad boy of bicycle building in Hong Kong|website=Young Post {{!}} South China Morning Post|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary and his partners at Wheel Thing Makers regularly collect useful wastes such as leather skin from sofas, hardwood plates of wardrobes, or rubber tires from vehicle repair stores in the waste collection station on streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eweekly.hk/article/_title/%25E8%25BD%2586%25E8%25BD%2586%25E7%2584%25A1%25E7%25AA%25AE_kpdo78smj3|title=E Media+ {{!}} E週刊 {{!}}  e+娛樂 {{!}} Mode {{!}} 美食旅客|website=eweekly.hk|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concepts evolve allover the world to tackle issue of rising excess of waste through creation of [[Circular economy|circular economies]] within the communities.

== Potential technologies and applications ==
The worldwide plastic production was 280 million tons in 2011 and production levels are growing every year. Its haphazard disposal causes severe environmental damage such as the creation of the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]].&lt;ref name="carbon nanomaterial" /&gt; In order to solve this problem, the employment of modern technologies and processes to reuse the waste plastic as a cheap substrate is under research. The goal is to bring this material from the waste stream back into the mainstream by developing processes which will create an economic demand for them.

One approach in the field involves the conversion of waste plastics (like [[LDPE]], [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], and [[HDPE]]) into [[paramagnetic]], conducting microspheres&lt;ref name="Mondal, M. 2013"&gt;Mondal, M., Gohs, U., Wagenknecht, U. and Heinrich, G. 2013. "Polypropylene/natural rubber thermoplastic vulcanizates by eco-friendly and sustainable electron induced reactive processing". ''Radiation Physics and Chemistry''. 88, 0 (2013), 74–81.&lt;/ref&gt;  or into carbon nanomaterials by applying high temperatures and [[chemical vapor deposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Altalhi, Tushar Kumeria, Abel Santos, Dusan Losic, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.07.003 "Synthesis of well-organised carbon nanotube membranes from non-degradable plastic bags with tuneable molecular transport: Towards nanotechnological recycling"], ''Carbon'', Volume 63, November 2013, pp. 423-433, {{ISSN|0008-6223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a molecular level, the treatment of [[polymers]] like [[polypropylene]] or [[thermoplastics]] with [[electron beam]]s (doses around 150 [[gray (unit)|kGy]]) can increase material properties like [[bending strength]] and [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and provides an eco-friendly and [[sustainable]] way to upcycle them.&lt;ref name="Mondal, M. 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Czvikovszky, T. and Hargitai, H. 1997. "Electron beam surface modifications in reinforcing and recycling of polymers. Nuclear Instruments and Methods" in ''Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms''. 131, 1–4 (1997), 300–304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Active research is being carried out for the [[biotransformation]] upcycling of plastic waste (e.g., [[polyethylene terephthalate]] and [[polyurethane]]) into [[Polyhydroxyalkanoates|PHA]] [[bioplastic]] using bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.p4sb.eu/|title=Homepage – P4SB|website=www.p4sb.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PET could be converted into the biodegradable [[Polyhydroxyalkanoates|PHA]] by using a combination of temperature and microbial treatment. First it gets [[pyrolysis|pyrolized]] at 450&amp;nbsp;°C and the resulting [[terephthalic acid]] is used as a substrate for microorganisms, which convert it finally into PHA.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, S.T., Runic, J.N., Kaminsky, W., Woods, T., Babu, R.P., Keely, C.M., Blau, W. and O’Connor, K.E. 2008. "Up-Cycling of PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) to the Biodegradable Plastic PHA (Polyhydroxyalkanoate)". ''Environmental Science &amp; Technology''. 42, 20 (2008), 7696–7701.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the aforementioned approach is the combination of nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes with powdered orange peel as a composite material. This might be used to remove synthetic [[dye]]s from [[wastewater]].&lt;ref&gt;Jain, N., Basniwal, R. K., Suman, Srivastava, A. K., &amp; Jain, V. K. (2010). "Reusable nanomaterial and plant biomass composites for the removal of methylene blue from water", ''Environmental Technology'', 31(7), 755-760.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biotechnology]] companies have recently shifted focus towards the conversion of agricultural waste, or [[biomass]], to different chemicals or commodities.  One company in particular, [[BioTork]], has signed an agreement with the State of Hawaii and the [[USDA]] to convert the unmarketable papayas in Hawaii into [[fish feed]].  As part of this Zero Waste Initiative put forth by the State of Hawaii, BioTork will upcycle the otherwise wasted biomass into a high quality, omega-rich fish feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domesticfuel.com/2014/08/07/hawaii-funds-biotork-advanced-biofuel-technology/|title=Hawaii Funds BioTork Advanced Biofuel Technology|website=Domestic Fuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Clothes == 
Designers have begun to use both industrial textile waste and existing clothing as base material for creating new fashions. Upcycling has been known to use either pre-consumer or post-consumer waste or possibly a combination of the two. Pre-consumer waste is made while in the factory, such as fabric remnants left over from cutting out patterns. post-consumer waste refers to the finished product when it’s no longer useful to the owner, such as donated clothes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.triplepundit.com/special/sustainable-fashion-2014/upcycling-new-wave-sustainable-fashion/|title=Upcycling: The New Wave of Sustainable Fashion|date=May 8, 2014|author= Beth Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
Often, we practice linear economy where we are content to buy, use then throw away. This system contributes to millions of kilos of textile waste being thrown away and makes fashion is the second-most polluting industry after oil &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://textilebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Global-apparel-fibre-consumption-vs-population-FINAL.jpg|title=Global-apparel-fibre-consumption-vs-population-FINAL.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;. while most textiles produced are recyclable, around 85% end-up in landﬁlls in the USA alone &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weber |first1=Sabine |last2=Lynes |first2=Jennifer |last3=Young |first3=Steven B. |title=Fashion interest as a driver for consumer textile waste management: reuse, recycle or disposal |journal=International Journal of Consumer Studies |date=March 2017 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=207–215 |doi=10.1111/ijcs.12328}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fast fashion companies are huge contributors to these problems as their whole purpose is to mass produce cheap clothing.
To live a sustainable life we need other clothing options that demonstrates the opposite to the throw away attitude fast fashion has lead us to. Upcycling can help us with this as it puts into practice a more circular economy model. A Circular Economy is where resources are used for as long as possible, getting the most value out of them while in use, then restored and repurposed when their use is over. Popularized by McDonough and Braungart’s this has also been known as the cradle-to-cradle principle. This principle states a product should be designed either to have multiple life cycles or be biodegradable &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.flinders.edu.au/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-51253-2.pdf|title=Sustainability in Fashion|editor=Claudia E. Henninger|editor2=Panayiota J. Alevizou|editor3=Helen Goworek|editor4=Daniella Ryding|date=|website=flinders.edu.au|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-51253-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Not only does upcycling help environmentally but there are also economic benefits. By reusing materials that others may not find as desirable there are huge savings that can be made on buying supplies for business or personal use. At schools or university upcycling for art, craft and design can be an easy and cheap way to prototype or finish a student project. The can also be an economic benefit with the final product. By it definition upcycling means increasing value to the original product and this can be done by changing/adding your own spin to the design or improving material quality or fixing broken clothes.
