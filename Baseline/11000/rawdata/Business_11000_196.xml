'''''Airport Tycoon''''' is a [[business simulation game]] released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows 95/98]] in 2000. It was developed in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Krisalis Software]] (now defunct). In ''Airport Tycoon'', the player must successfully build and manage an airport without going bankrupt. There have been two sequels created for ''Airport Tycoon'': ''Airport Tycoon 2'' and ''Airport Tycoon 3''. There was to be a [[Nintendo 64]] version released as well, but this version was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2008/04/03/airport-inc-64-cancelled/|title=Airport Inc. 64 [N64 - Cancelled] - Unseen64|date=3 April 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Airport Tycoon'' was originally called ''Airport Inc.'' and ''Air Mogul''. A week before the game's publishing, Krisalis Software changed its name to ''Airport Tycoon'' in some markets, a more catchy title. However, the game calls itself ''Air Mogul'' because of the inadequate time to change the software, and is sold in [[PAL]] as ''Airport Inc.'' Krisalis became defunct shortly after publishing ''Airport Tycoon''.

==Gameplay==
Similar to other games of this type, the player takes the form of an airport manager by first selecting a location for his or her airport from several cities around the world before beginning his or her airport. The player then constructs a terminal for passengers, then runways, tarmac, control towers and support services.

The player then attracts businesses to his or her airport by signing contracts with vendors in the terminal and contracting flights into and out of the airport. The player also manages the airport's budget, which can not operate too deeply in the red. Players can operate passenger airports and cargo airports with different considerations for each.

A number of preset scenarios are also available to the player, including the conversion of a major cargo airport to a passenger airport in [[Beijing]].

==Reception==
The game was poorly received by critics.{{cn|date=October 2017}} Frequent criticisms included difficulty of gameplay, substandard graphics and confusing controls.{{cn|date=October 2017}} It received a 62/100 score from [[PC Gamer]],{{cn|date=October 2017}} 3/10 from [[IGN]],{{cn|date=October 2017}} among other rankings.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==Sequels==
''Airport Tycoon'' was followed by a sequel, ''Airport Tycoon 2'', in 2003. It was developed by [[Sunstorm Interactive]] and published by [[Global Star Software]] on February 26, 2003 for Windows PC. ''Airport Tycoon 2'' received negative reviews from critics. Aggregating review website [[GameRankings]] provides an average score of 31% based on 9 reviews,&lt;ref name="GRPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/563583-airport-tycoon-2/index.html |title=Airport Tycoon 2 (PC) |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |date= February 26, 2003|accessdate=December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Metacritic]] provides a score of 32 out of 100 based on 6 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews."&lt;ref name="MCPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/airport-tycoon-2 |title=Airport Tycoon 2 (PC) |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |date= February 26, 2003|accessdate=December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third game in the series, ''Airport Tycoon 3'', was developed by InterActive Vision and published by Global Star on October 30, 2003. Based on four professional reviews, Metacritic finds that ''Airport Tycoon 3'' has received "generally unfavorable" reviews and establishes a metascore of 46/100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/airporttycoon3|title=Airport Tycoon 3 (pc: 2003): Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2012-06-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090506085124/http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/airporttycoon3| archivedate= 6 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airport Tycoon received negative reviews by [[IGN]] and [[GameSpot]] calling the game "irritating and monotonous", and the general review of the game on both the sites stated that the game was "lackluster" and "bland" not only in gameplay but in sound and texture, and its mechanics were "tedious". GameSpot's final comment on the game was that "It's unfortunate that the execution in the game is so disappointing in virtually every respect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport Tycoon Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/02/06/airport-tycoon-3-review|website=IGN|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airport Tycoon 3 Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/airport-tycoon-3-review/1900-6086428/|website=GameSpot|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Australian Food and Grocery Council''' ('''AFGC''') represents [[Australia|Australia's]] food, drink and grocery manufacturing industry. AFGC's stated vision is for Australia's food, beverage and grocery manufacturing industry to be socially responsible and competing profitably domestically and overseas. The [[chief executive officer]] of the Australian Food and Grocery Council is former Liberal party politician, [[Kate Carnell]], who was Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) from 1995 to 2000.

They are a membership-based organisation totally funded by industry to work on behalf of industry in the following areas:

* '''Policy''' - Analyse and influence federal and state policies to ensure our members' views are represented at the highest level.
* '''Member Service''' - Offering a wide range of professional services specifically tailored to meet their members' needs.
* '''Programs''' - Providing targeted programs to deliver solutions for members and stakeholders.
* '''Representation and Advocacy''' - Presenting a united voice and advocate on behalf of the food and grocery manufacturing industry.
* '''Communication''' - Keeping members up to date, and promoting the industry.

==Political influence==
In November 2009, the AFGC successfully lobbied the [[Coalition (Australia)|coalition]] to exempt agriculture and food processing from their [[emissions trading scheme]] negotiations for good. Dr [[Rosemary Stanton]] has argued this was a lost opportunity to reform the food industry and the health of Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2009/11/03/reform-the-food-industry-for-the-sake-of-the-planet/|title=Reform the food industry — for the sake of the planet|last=Stanton|first=Rosemary|publisher=Crikey.com.au|accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFGC has also supported advertisements for a business lobby group describing itself as "Responsible Recycling" that criticise the Northern Territory container deposit scheme as a verity of it

'''Business economics''' is a field in [[applied economics]] which uses [[economic theory]] and quantitative methods to analyze [[Business|business enterprises]] and the factors contributing to the diversity of organizational structures and the relationships of firms with labour, [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and product markets.&lt;ref name="Moschandreas"&gt;Moschandreas, Maria (2000). ''Business Economics'', 2nd Edition, Thompson Learning,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=ncVfjhTULyAC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA410#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Description] and chapter-preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=ncVfjhTULyAC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false links].&lt;/ref&gt; A professional focus of the journal ''[[Business Economics (journal)|Business Economics]]'' has been expressed as providing "practical information for people who apply economics in their jobs."&lt;ref&gt;National Association for Business Economics, ''[http://www.nabe.com/busecon.htm ''Business Economics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111082746/http://www.nabe.com/busecon.htm |date=November 11, 2011 }}''®&lt;/ref&gt;
Business economics is an integral part of traditional economics. It is an extension of economic concepts to the real business situations. It is an applied science in the sense of a tool of managerial decision-making and forward planning by management. In other words, Business economics is concerned with the application of economic theory to business management.

==Subject matter==
Business economics is concerned with economic issues and problems related to business organization, management, and strategy. Issues and problems include: an explanation of why ''corporate'' firms emerge and exist; why they expand: horizontally, vertically and spacially; the role of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship; the significance of organizational structure; the relationship of firms with the employees, the providers of capital, the customers, the government; the interactions between firms and the business environment.&lt;ref name="Moschandreas"/&gt;

==Ambiguity in the use of term==
The term 'business economics' is used in a variety of ways.  Sometimes it is used as synonymously with industrial economics/[[industrial organisation]], [[managerial economics]], and economics for business. Still, there may be substantial differences in the usage of 'economics for business' and 'managerial economics' with the latter used more narrowly.
One view of the distinctions between these would be that business economics is wider in its scope than industrial economics in that it would be concerned not only with "industry" but also businesses in the service sector. Economics for business looks at the major principles of economics but focuses on applying these economic principles to the real world of business.&lt;ref&gt;Sloman, J and Sutcliffe (2004) Economics for Business, Financial Times/ Prentice Hall; 3 edition&lt;/ref&gt; Managerial economics is the application of economic methods in the managerial decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;• Jones, Trefor, 2004 ''Business Economics and Managerial Decision Making'', Wiley. [http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000988.html Description] and chapter-preview  [https://books.google.com/books?id=qr7TORfhBwQC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false links].&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Wilkinson, Nick (2005). ''Managerial Economics: A Problem-Solving Approach'', Cambridge University Press. [http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1170271/?site_locale=en_GB Description] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=O-Fv7B4J-6EC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations from various universities ==
Many universities offer courses in business economics and offer a range of interpretations as to the meaning of the word.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uel.ac.uk/programmes/business/undergraduate/summary/businesseco.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bachelor of Business Economics (BBE) Program at [[University of Delhi]] is designed to meet the growing need for an analytical and quantitative approach to problem solving in the changing corporate world by the application of the latest techniques evolved in the fields of economics and business.&lt;ref&gt;http://du.ac.in/du/index.php?page=business-economics-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (UAB), the [[Universidad Pública de Navarra]] (UPNa) and the [[University of the Balearic Islands]] (UIB) developed an official Master of Science in Management, Organization and Business Economics focused on management and business topics to train professionals in the study of organizations, on a conceptual and quantitative basis. To achieve this, advanced analysis tools are used from the fields of [[Neoclassical economics]], [[New institutional economics]], [[Statistics]], [[Econometrics]] and [[Operations research]]. This focus is complemented with contributing ideas and theories to develop the necessary instruments to facilitate the management of sophisticated and complex organizations.&lt;ref&gt;UAB,UPNa, UIB - Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Management, Organization and Business Economics - MMOBE Program. [http://pagines.uab.cat/mmobe/ Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program at [[Harvard University]] uses economic methods to analyze practical aspects of business, including [[business administration]], management, and related fields of business economics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/programs_of_study/business_economics_4.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Miami]] defines business economics as involving the study of how we use our resources for the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.  This requires business economists to analyze social institutions, banks, the stock market, the government and their relationships with labor negotiations, taxes, international trade, and urban and environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miami.muohio.edu/academics/majorsminors/majors/businesseconomics.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725091346/http://www.miami.muohio.edu/academics/majorsminors/majors/businesseconomics.cfm |archivedate=2009-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courses at the [[University of Manchester]] interpret business economics to be concerned with the economic analysis of how businesses contribute to welfare of society rather than on the welfare of an individual or a business. This is done via an examination of the relationship between ownership, control and firm objectives; theories of the growth of the firm; the behavioural [[theory of the firm]]; theories of entrepreneurship; the factors that influence the [[Structure-conduct-performance paradigm|structure, conduct and performance]] of business at the industry level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/modules/modulelist.html?department%3D3%26newcode%3DECON2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224053759/http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/modules/modulelist.html?department=3&amp;newcode=ECON2 |archivedate=2008-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Universities borrow their concept of business economics from the tradition of [[Gino Zappa]], for example a standard course&lt;ref&gt;https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&amp;evn_default=evento&amp;c_classe=618079&amp;__pj0=0&amp;__pj1=6f3356db456e221b165cf3ee421a14ec&lt;/ref&gt;  at the [[Politecnico di Milano]] involves studying [[corporate governance]], [[accounting]], [[investment analysis]], [[budgeting]] and [[business strategy]].

[[La Trobe University]] of Melbourne, Australia associates business economics with the process of demand, supply and equilibrium coordinating the behaviour of individuals and businesses in the market. Also, business economics extends to government policy, economic variables and international factors which influence business and competition.

[[File:Emblem Ceirano.JPG|thumb|1924 Ceirano badge]]
'''Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili''', or '''Ceirano Giovanni Fabbrica Automobili''' or '''Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili'''&lt;ref name="Georgano"&gt;The Complete Encyclopedia of the Motor Car, 1885 to the Present, by G.N. Georgano, Ebury Press, 1973. page 177. Ceirano ii Italy, 1919-1931&lt;/ref&gt; was an Italian automobile manufacturer from Turin, founded in 1919 by [[Giovanni Ceirano]] and his son [[Giovanni "Ernesto" Ceirano]].

The company was active from 1919 until 25 August 1923 when Giovanni amalgamated it with '[[SCAT (automobile)|Società Ceirano Automobili Torino (S.C.A.T.)]], which he had founded in 1906 and left in 1917, to form [[SCAT-Ceirano]].

==Ceirano family background==

The Ceirano brothers, [[Giovanni Battista Ceirano|Giovanni Battista]], [[Giovanni Ceirano|Giovanni]], [[Ernesto Ceirano|Ernesto]] and [[Matteo Ceirano|Matteo]], were influential in the founding of the Italian auto industry, being variously responsible for : [[Ceirano GB &amp; C|Ceirano]]; [[Ceirano GB &amp; C|Welleyes (the technical basis of F.I.A.T.)]]; [[Fratelli Ceirano]]; [[Società Torinese Automobili Rapid|S.T.A.R. / Rapid]] ([[Società Torinese Automobili Rapid]]); [[SCAT (automobile)|SCAT]] (Società Ceirano Automobili Torino); [[Itala]] and [[S.P.A. (automobile)|S.P.A. (Società Piemontese Automobili)]]. Giovanni's son [[Giovanni "Ernesto" Ceirano|Giovanni "Ernesto"]] was also influential, co-founding Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and [[Aurea (car)|Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA)]].

In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building ''Welleyes'' bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italiancar.net/site/cars/lancia/index/lancia.html Lancia, the essentials]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1898 Giovanni Battista and Matteo co-founded [[Ceirano GB &amp; C]] and started producing the ''Welleyes'' motor car in 1899. In July 1899 the plant and patents were sold to [[Giovanni Agnelli]] and produced as the first [[F.I.A.T.]]s - the [[Fiat 4 HP]]. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found [[Fratelli Ceirano|Fratelli Ceirano &amp; C.]] which in 1903 became [[Società Torinese Automobili Rapid]] (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as 'Rapid'. In 1904 [[Matteo Ceirano]] left Ceirano GB &amp; C to create his own brand - [[Itala]]. In 1906 Matteo left Itala to found [[S.P.A. (automobile)|S.P.A. (Società Piemontese Automobili)]] with chief designer, Alberto Ballacco. In 1906 Giovanni founded [[SCAT (automobile)|SCAT]] (Società Ceirano Automobili Torino) in Turin. In 1919 Giovanni and Giovanni "Ernesto" co-founded Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and in 1922 they took control of  [[Aurea (car)|Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA)]].

==History ==
[[File:Ceirano 1924.JPG|thumb|1924 Ceirano]]
Giovanni and Ernesto sold their main share-holding in [[SCAT (automobile)|S.C.A.T.]] in 1917, and in 1919 ''Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili'''s new range was based on the pre-war (1914) S.C.A.T..

{{Accounting}}
'''Chartered Certified Accountant''' (designatory letters '''ACCA''' or '''FCCA''') is a protected designation awarded by the '''[[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]]''' ('''ACCA'''). The Association is UK based and was historically an organisation of [[British qualified accountants]], however it is now a global body for professional accountants with 208,000 qualified members allowed to use the designation and 503,000 students globally.  Support offices/centres exist over 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/uk/en/about-us.html|title=Global body for professional accountants - Accountancy - About Us|website=www.accaglobal.com|publisher=Association of Chartered Certified Accountants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The term ''Chartered Certified Accountant'' was introduced in 1996.  Prior to that date, [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] members were known as ''Certified Accountant.''  It is still permissible for an ACCA member to use this term. Members of ACCA with post-qualification experience of more than five years and have completed the required continued professional development are designated Fellows, and use the designatory letters FCCA in place of ACCA.

The term ''Chartered'' refers to the [[Royal Charter]] granted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of the [[United Kingdom]].

Chartered Certified Accountants work in all fields of business and finance. Some are engaged in public practice work, others work in the private sector and some are employed by government bodies.

Since ''Chartered Certified Accountant'' is a legally protected term, individuals who describe themselves as such must be members of ACCA. If they carry out public practice engagements, they must comply with additional regulations such as holding a practising certificate, being [[professional indemnity insurance|insured]] against any possible liability claims and submitting to inspections.

==Syllabus==
The current syllabus is made up of 13 examinations, although some exemptions are available. The papers are split into two levels:
* The Applied Knowledge level: 3 examinations consisting of 
** AB - Accountant in Business
** MA - [[Management Accounting]]
** FA - [[Financial Accounting]]
* The Applied Skills level: 6 examinations consisting of 
** LW - Corporate and Business Law
** PM - Performance Management
** TX - [[Taxation]]
** FR - [[Financial Reporting]]
** AA - [[Audit]] and Assurance
** FM - [[Finance|Financial Management]]
* The Strategic Professional level - 6 examinations consisting of 
** Two compulsory papers:
*** SBL - Strategic Business Leader
*** SBR - Strategic Business Reporting
** Four optional papers, of which two must be selected:
*** AFM - Advanced Financial Management
*** APM - Advanced Performance Management
*** ATX - Advanced Taxation
*** AAA - Advanced Audit and Assurance

'''Commercial management''' is "the identification and development of business opportunities and the profitable management of projects and contracts, from inception to completion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://icm.education/what-is-commercial-management/ "What is Commercial Management?"] – [[Institute of Commercial Management]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial management within an organization is applied only at [[policy]] levels. Commercial policies relate to the rules or practices that define how business will be conducted and the standard terms under which external relationships will be conducted. Many of these policies are reflected in the terms of any [[contract]] in which the organization engages. At a transactional level, commercial management is applied through the oversight of [[Trade|trading]] relationships to ensure their compliance with business goals or policies and to understand or manage the financial and risk implications of any variations.

'''Corporate tax in the Netherlands''' deals with the tax payable in [[the Netherlands]] on the profits earned by companies. In general, a Dutch company is subject to 25% corporate tax ("vennootschapsbelasting") on its worldwide profits. However, certain items of income are exempt from tax and certain costs are non-deductible.

==Worldwide profits==
A Dutch company is subject to Dutch corporate tax on its worldwide profits, after taking into account tax deductible costs. 

==Rate==
The 2013 Dutch corporate tax rate was 20% of the taxable income up to and including €200,000, above which the rate is 25%.

==Exemptions==
Certain items of income are exempt from Dutch corporate tax. The most important items of income that are exempt are:

* capital gains and dividends derived from qualifying subsidiaries ("participation exemption")
* income attributable to a foreign business enterprise ("permanent establishment").

===Participation exemption===
Capital gains, dividends and profit participation loan interest derived from a qualifying subsidiary are fully exempt from corporate tax in the Netherlands ("participation exemption"). A subsidiary qualifies for the Dutch participation exemption when:

* the subsidiary is an active company, and
* the Dutch parent company holds an interest of at least 5% of such company.

===Foreign branch===
Any income received by a Dutch company from a foreign branch is exempt from Dutch corporate tax, provided such branch is a permanent establishment or representative.{{cn|date=April 2012}}

==Tax haven==

The Netherlands has been known internationally, since at least the 1970s, as a [[tax haven]]. A political debate about this issue started in 1977, when economist and [[Labor Party (Netherlands)|social-democratic]] MP [[Flip de Kam]] published a book about corporations transferring large sums to Caribbean countries without paying Dutch corporate tax. Minister [[Fons van der Stee|Van der Stee]] admitted that the country was internationally known as a tax haven, but refused to act, arguing that the problem could not be solved on a national level alone.&lt;ref name="vn"&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Nederland belastingparadijs, met dank aan de PvdA |newspaper=[[Vrij Nederland]] |first1=Tomas |last1=Vanheste |first2=Map |last2=Oberndorff |url=http://www.vn.nl/nederland-belastingparadijs-met-dank-aan-de-pvda/ |trans-title=The Netherlands a tax haven, thanks to the Labor Party |date=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate raged for years; in 1986, [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Representative]] [[Willem Vermeend]] estimated that the country's tax service missed some [[Dutch guilder|ƒ]]4 billion per year due to companies such as [[The Rolling Stones]]' holding [[Besloten vennootschap|bv]]'s using the "Caribbean route".{{r|vn}}

Dutch tax laws have brought the country into conflict with the [[European Union]] several times, starting with strong criticism in the 1999 [[Dawn Primarolo|Primarolo]] Report. The Dutch government responded by having a group of high-ranking fiscal experts (known with the [[Ministry of Finance (Netherlands)|Ministry of Finance]] as the "[[Barbapapa]] group") create a smoke screen, changing the appearance of the fiscal system while leaving its structure intact.{{r|vn}}

Starting 2009, the "tax haven" label resurfaced and sparked political controversy when the [[White House]] issued a press release in which the Netherlands was mentioned as tax haven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxjustice.nl/?nid=62060|title=The Netherlands a tax haven, a misunderstanding?|publisher=Tax Justice nl|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2009/05/us_tax_haven_claim_surprises_d.php|title=US tax haven claim surprises Dutch|date=5 May 2009|publisher=DutchNews.nl|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to various NGO's the Netherlands "can be seen as an intermediary tax haven for foreign corporations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somo.nl/news-en/new-tax-treaty-policy-prejudices-developing-countries/|title=New tax treaty policy prejudices developing countries|date=20 April 2011|publisher=Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Michielse|first=Geerten|date=24 February 2011|title=Mag het een beetje minder koopman zijn?|publisher=Tijdschrift voor Fiscaal Recht|url=http://www.michielse.com/files/NTFR_2011-379.pdf|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="masters"&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/19/tax-avoidance-in-netherlands-becomes-focus-of-campaigners |date=19 October 2011 |title=Dutch masters of tax avoidance |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, the Dutch House of Representatives accepted a motion calling on cabinet members to "reject, and where possible in discussions to insist on not mentioning" the qualification of the country as a tax haven; the motion was drafted by MP [[Roland van Vliet]], a former tax advisor with [[Ernst &amp; Young]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |title=Geert Wilders houdt wél van belastingparadijs Nederland |trans-title=Geert Wilders does love Holland, the tax haven |first=Henk Willem |last=Smits |url=http://www.quotenet.nl/Nieuws/Geert-Wilders-houdt-wel-van-belastingparadijs-Nederland-53310 |date=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Economist {{ill|Ewald Engelen|nl}} estimated that at the time of the motion, the state earned some €1.5 billion in tax from €12 thousand billion being transferred through the country annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |first=Ewald |last=Engelen |title=Nederland is een topplek voor belastingontwijking |trans-title=Holland is a great place for tax avoidance |date=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2013}}, the country harbors [[holding company|holding companies]] for various multinationals, participates in more than a hundred bilateral [[tax treaty|tax treaties]], and the various [[#Exemptions|exemptions]] facilitate [[tax avoidance]] by corporations.{{r|vn}}{{r|masters}}

In June 2014 the EU initiated a new investigation relating to the Dutch corporate taxes as part of a [[State aid (European Union)]] case by the Directorate General for Competition. The case was specific to [[Starbucks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-14/starbucks-dutch-tax-deal-clashes-with-global-rules-eu|title=Starbucks Unit Swapped Millions of Euros for Roasting Art|publisher=Bloomberg|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The investigation ended in October 2015, with the EC ordering Starbucks to pay up to €30 million in overdue taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5880_en.htm|title=Commission decides selective tax advantages for Fiat in Luxembourg and Starbucks in the Netherlands are illegal under EU state aid rules|publisher=European Commission|date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EC exposed in its decision a legal structure commonly used by companies established in the Netherlands to avoid corporate taxation, the so called Dutch BV-CV structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibfd.org/IBFD-Products/Journal-Articles/Bulletin-for-International-Taxation/collections/bit/html/bit_2016_03_nl_1.html|title=European Union/Netherlands - Dutch CV-BV Structures: Starbucks-Style Tax Planning and State Aid Rules.|publisher=IBFD|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017, the EU initiated another [[State aid (European Union)]] investigation into a special deal on corporate taxation between the Dutch public administration and [[IKEA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-5343_en.htm
|title=State aid: Commission opens in-depth investigation into the Netherlands' tax treatment of Inter IKEA|publisher=European Commission|date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

National and foreign companies known to have special agreements with the Dutch tax service include Starbucks, [[Microsoft]] and [[PostNL]]. A 2015 [[Freedom of information laws by country#Netherlands|FOI]] request by ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' to unearth the agreements failed, because these secret agreements are not centrally administered by the [[Tax and Customs Administration]]; with even the House of Representatives not having access to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Belastingdienst: geen zicht op deals met bedrijven |trans-title=Tax Administration: no overview of deals with corporations |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/belastingdienst-geen-zicht-op-deals-met-bedrijven~a4168976/ |newspaper=De Volkskrant |date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyberjaya''' is a town with a science park as the core that forms a key part of the [[Multimedia Super Corridor]] in Malaysia. It is located in [[Sepang District]], [[Selangor]]. Cyberjaya is adjacent to, and developed along with [[Putrajaya]], Malaysia's new seat of government. This town aspires to be known as the '''[[Silicon Valley]] of Malaysia'''.

The official opening ceremony for Cyberjaya was held in May 1997 by the Prime Minister, [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]].

==Location==
Cyberjaya, about 26 km SSW from downtown [[Kuala Lumpur]], is located in the [[Sepang District]] in southern [[Selangor]] state, located in the mukim of [[Dengkil]]. It is adjacent to the [[Putrajaya|Federal Territory of Putrajaya]], the administrative capital of the government of Malaysia. {{cn|date=June 2018}}

Cyberjaya is located in the middle of the [[Langat River|Langat valley]], about halfway between [[Kajang]] and [[Banting]], and about 20 km north of the [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] and 40 km northwest of [[Seremban]]. Other adjacent towns include [[Puchong]], [[Seri Kembangan]], [[Putra Heights]], [[Jenjarom]] and [[Bangi, Malaysia|Bangi]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==History==
Until 1975, what is today Cyberjaya, Putrajaya and  [[Dengkil (state constituency)|Dengkil]] were under the administration of [[Hulu Langat|Hulu Langat (Kajang)]] district. On the site of today's Cyberjaya once stood an estate, known as ''Prang Besar'' estate.

The idea of an [[Information technology|IT]]-themed city, Cyberjaya, arose out of a study by management consultancy [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] for the Multimedia Super Corridor commissioned by the Federal Government of Malaysia in 1995. The implementation agency was the Town &amp; Country Planning Department of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The catalyst is the agreement by NTT in 1996 to site an R&amp;D center at a site to the west of the new Malaysian administration center, [[Putrajaya]].

Multimedia Development Corporation (then known as MDC), the agency overseeing the implementation of the MSC was located in Cyberjaya to oversee the creation. The real estate implementation was privatised to Cyberview Sdn Bhd (Cyberview) in early 1997. At the time, Cyberview was set up a joint-venture comprising entities such as Setia Haruman Sdn Bhd (SHSB), Nippon Telephone and Telegraph (NTT), [[Golden Hope]], [[Multimedia Development Corporation|MDeC]], [[Permodalan Nasional Berhad|Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB)]] and Kumpulan Darul Ehsan Berhad (KDEB), representative of the Selangor Government. SHSB, a consortium comprising Renong, Landmarks, MKLand and Country Heights, was asked to take the lead regarding the development. Federal government linked companies [[Telekom Malaysia]] and [[Tenaga Nasional]] were conscripted to provide the telecommunication and power supply infrastructure. The ambitious plan was to develop the first phase, comprising 1,430 hectares by year 2006, with the remaining 1,460 hectares to be developed after year 2011. The engineering management consultant, Pengurusan Lebuhraya Bhd (now acquired by Opus International Malaysia) was appointed to manage the construction of utilities and infrastructure, overseeing major construction firms of Peremba and [[UEM Group|United Engineers Malaysia (UEM)]].

However, due to the late [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], the undertaking was deemed no longer viable and necessitated the Government taking over of the 55% and 15% stake in Cyberview shares held by SHSB and NTT respectively via the Ministry of Finance Inc (MOF Inc). The transaction gave MOF Inc a 70% stake and Cyberview has remained a government-owned company ever since. Cyberview then entered into an agreement with SHSB with shareholders comprising Country Heights Holdings Berhad (CHHB), Landmarks, Menara Embun (an MKLand Controlled Company) and Renong (now UEM World) with equal shares of 25%; granting SHSB the right to develop Cyberjaya as the master developer, while Cyberview became the landowner. In 2004, CHHB and Landmarks sold their equity interest in SHSB to MKLand-controlled companies, namely Modern Eden (12.5%), Impressive Circuits (12.5%) and Virtual Path (25%), resulting in MKLand-controlled companies becoming the majority shareholder of SHSB.

Cyberview's role grew to include implementing various development and government initiatives, while SHSB carried on its role as the master developer. In addition to this, Cyberview was also tasked to undertake citywide maintenance and spearhead investor interface and community-centric programmes in Cyberjaya.

In 2014, efforts went underway to reposition Cyberjaya from Malaysia's first cybercity to a global technology hub.

==Physical development==
Spanning an area of about 28.94 square kilometres (7,000 acres), the town is the nucleus of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), now known as MSC Malaysia. The site for Cyberjaya was primarily undeveloped land consisting of oil palm plantations. It has since seen extensive building activities including a boutique hotel, numerous commercial buildings, offices for MSC Status companies, universities, a community club and the headquarters for the local council.
[[File:Cyberjaya Aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Cyberjaya Aerial Shot]]
It was built to be the city of the future, but no goals toward this end have been announced. The Multimedia Development Corporation (MDeC) (formerly MDC), the agency tasked with spearheading the MSC's progress, has its headquarters in the heart of Cyberjaya.

Setia Haruman also undertakes the development of properties such as office buildings, retail space and apartment suites to meet the market’s demand. Apart from being a Master Developer of Cyberjaya, Setia Haruman also wears the hat as a Property Developer and have constructed commercial, residential and enterprise buildings to meet the demands of the thriving community in Cyberjaya.

===Office and commercial facilities===
A number of companies who qualify for MSC incentives have relocated their operations to Cyberjaya. Among them are T-systems, Dell, HP, DHL, Satyam, Wipro, HSBC, Ericsson, Motorola, OCBC, BMW, IBM, Shell IT, Monster.com, Vivanova Systems, the Response Centre of the Anti Money Laundering Network and others. Currently, over 500 MSC Status companies have located their operations here, making the township a rapidly growing area.

Today, Cyberjaya is home for several government agencies such as Malaysian Department of Public Services, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Human Resource and Sepang Municipal Council.

MKN Embassy Techzone is a freehold ICT business park project on approximately {{convert|41|acre|ha}} of prime Cyberjaya land in the flagship zone aimed for lease to multinational companies. The project is developed by MKN Embassy Development Sdn. Bhd., a joint venture company between EMKAY Group of Malaysia and Embassy Group of India, who is as a strategic partner for EMKAY Group in the development of this specialised ICT building.

===Education facilities===

[[File:CYBER.jpg|thumb|[[Multimedia University]] campus]]
[[Multimedia University]] is one of the higher education institutions and an early component of Cyberjaya. The Cyberjaya campus was opened on 8 July 1999. The university's enrolment in Cyberjaya is about 20,277 students. Approximately 19% of these are international students from 80 countries. Faculty departments include Engineering, Information Technology, Creative Multimedia and Management. This campus was the brainchild of the country's fourth prime minister, Tun Dr [[Mahathir Mohamad]], as a center of learning and research for the [[Multimedia Super Corridor]] (MSC), a 750&amp;nbsp;km² area designated as the country's high-tech research and industrial area.

Other higher education institutions in Cyberjaya are [[Limkokwing University of Creative Technology]], University Malaysia of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Heriot-Watt University, Cyberjaya University College of Medical Sciences; Cyber Putra College and Kirkby International College.

There is a [[Sekolah Seri Puteri]] which is a National Secondary Full Boarding School (''Bahasa Malaysia: Sekolah Berasrama Penuh'') for girls.

To cater for schoolgoing children of the general population of Cyberjaya, there are primary (Sekolah Kebangsaan Cyberjaya) and secondary ([[Sekolah Menengah Cyberjaya]]) public schools. The student population is about 350 and 750 for the primary and the secondary schools respectively.

The Korean expatriate population of the Kuala Lumpur area is served by the [[Korean School of Malaysia]] in Cyberjaya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ksmy.kr/ Home]. [[Korean School of Malaysia]]. Retrieved on 16 October 2018. "No 7&amp;8, Jalan CV 2, Selangor Cyber Valley 63300 Cyberjaya, Selangor"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public facilities===
As an emerging township, Cyberjaya now has a Police Station Complex, and a Fire Station (Bomba). Apart from that, other public amenities which are completed includes a small recreational park just next to Multimedia University, the Cyberjaya Community Club, the Sports Arena (which offers outdoor sports facilities), bus shelters, pedestrian walkways and signalised pedestrian crossing at road junctions and more than 700 parking bays.

===Recreation facilities===

====Parks====
The Cyberjaya Lake Gardens is a {{convert|400|acre|km2|sing=on}} 'green lung' for Cyberjaya. Presently, about {{convert|86|acre|ha}} of the land has been developed with facilities including Visitor's Information Centre, Boardwalk, Look-Out Tower, children's playground, {{convert|15|acre|ha}} of main lake and {{convert|29|acre|ha}} of natural and wetland. The Lake Gardens is now gaining popularity amongst the local community. Many community events including fishing competitions have attracted thousands to this lake. In September 2007, the Cyberjaya 50th Merdeka Carnival Celebration has attracted more than 4,000 anglers and it was registered as the biggest fishing competition by the Malaysia Book of Records.
{{clear}}
{{Wide image|Cyberjaya_Lake_Gardens_panorama.jpg|1024px|Panorama of Putrajaya from Prescint 7 Promenade in February 2011.}}

Other outdoor recreational facilities include the mini park, adjacent to the Multimedia University; the 3.5&amp;nbsp;km promenade area next to the Putrajaya Lake; and the Sports Arena which offers more than 360 free parking bays, 1 basketball court, 1 tennis court, 2 futsal courts, a football field and a small food court.

For indoor recreational facilities, the Cyberjaya Community Club, developed by Cyberview, has 2 futsal courts, 2 badminton courts, a gymnasium and 2 squash courts; all indoor and outdoor recreational facilities including basketball court, 2 tennis courts, swimming pool, a go-kart circuit and golf driving range.

====Nightlife====
[[File:Cyberview Lodge.jpg|thumb|Cyberview Lodge Resort and Spa in February 2011.]]
The city has a number of bars and restaurants, including Japanese food options. The latest addition is the up-coming Live Style Mall - The Tamarind Square.

===Transportation===
====Car====
The completion of the [[Maju Expressway|KL–Putrajaya Highway (MEX Highway)]] {{MES-E|20}} in December 2007 has cut short the travel time by car from Kuala Lumpur to Cyberjaya to 20 minutes. The KL–Putrajaya Highway was meant to be a shortcut for motorists from downtown Kuala Lumpur and other places along its alignment to get to [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] in 30 minutes. The highway which ends at the Putrajaya Utama toll plaza links up to the [[North-South Expressway Central Link|Elite Highway]] {{MES-E|6}} which will then give motorists only another 10 minutes to get to the airport. Drivers have a toll-free alternative route with the completion of the Selangor State Route B15 extension that passes through Dengkil and Bandar Baru Salak Tinggi. The [[South Klang Valley Expressway|SKVE]] {{MES-E|26}} serves as a shortcut to [[Port Klang]].

====Public transportation====

The [[KLIA Transit]], on the [[Express Rail Link]] network, is the only railway line serving Cyberjaya and the adjacent Putrajaya. In fact, the two towns share one railway station - the [[Putrajaya/Cyberjaya ERL station]] {{KLRT color code|KT|3}}. However, by 2022, the [[Sungai Buloh–Serdang–Putrajaya MRT line|MRT SSP Line]] will have two MRT stations serving Cyberjaya. The ERL station, alternately known as ''Putrajaya Sentral'', also serves as a transportation hub which provides conventional bus routes from [[Bandar Utama bus hub|Bandar Utama]] and [[Puchong]] (&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;506&lt;/span&gt;); Express Bus Route to Jalan Sultan Mohamad, Kuala Lumpur (&lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;E1&lt;/span&gt;) and the local bus (&lt;span style="color:green"&gt;520&lt;/span&gt;) as a feeder service from [[Putrajaya/Cyberjaya ERL station|Putrajaya Sentral]] to Cyberjaya.

Cyberjaya itself has just few buses. These buses are not timed to match the timing of the train services and the buses' fare increase to RM 2 for each trip. However, the service is frequent but reliability and safety is concerning at times.
 
To improve transportation within the town, Cyberview has launched a free park and ride system which is a viable alternative for those wishing to park at the designated areas in Cyberjaya and commuting to areas of the city.

Cyberjaya features a single bus terminal, known as the Cyberjaya Transport Terminal for Cyberjaya's own ''Dedicated Transportation System'', comprising bus routes connecting Cyberjaya to [[Ampang Jaya|Ampang]], [[Gombak LRT station|Gombak]], [[Bandar Tasik Selatan station|Bandar Tasik Selatan]], [[Bandar Utama]], [[Kepong]], [[Shah Alam]] and [[Klang, Malaysia|Klang]]. Taxis are available at the terminal.

'''Bicycle Sharing'''

This service is being offered by [[oBike]] and [[Mobike]] to solve last-mile commute. The bicycles can be rented from almost any location in the city simply by using a smartphone app.

===Residential Areas===
As of February 2017, there are plenty of landed and high rise residential developments being offered for residential stay. High rise residential and integrated developments including the likes of Shaftsbury Square, D'Pulze, Serin Residency, Cybersquare, Crystal, The Place, Pangea, Arc, D'Melor, Domain, Cyberia smart homes, Masreca19 and etc. Landed housing including Sejati Residences, Symphony Hills, Garden Residence, Summer Glades, Mirage by the Lake, Setia Eco Glades. With the many upcoming developments, there will be at least an additional 10,000 of residential units in the next two years. It's being perceived Garden Residence, Cyberjaya is the most strategic landed properties in Cyberjaya due to its proximity to SkyPark, Cyberjaya Center Centre and IOI Resort City Mall. The upcoming development around Garden Residence Cyberjaya is that there will be two stop-over stations of MRT line 2 and another RM15 billion worth of developments over the next five years in Cyberjaya City Center.

==Population==

The day-time population in Cyberjaya is about 102,000 and the current population is expected to increase to 110,000 by end of 2018 with the robust developments taking place. Cyberjaya's population is expected to increase to 210,000 by 2020.

==Cyberjaya Smart District Development==
Cyberjaya is planned as an intelligent district with ICT and multimedia industries, R&amp;D centres, a Multimedia University and operational headquarters for multinationals wishing to direct their worldwide manufacturing and trading activities using multimedia technology.This project will be fully owned by the Ministry Of Infrastructure Development under the Smart Nation 2050 initiatives that will help boost local multimedia and technology sector.It will consist of two phases with Phase 1 is slated for completion by 2050 and Phase 2 within the next 5 years . This development will overseen an increase revenue in the technology , multimedia and R&amp;D sector with the total estimate of 470 Billion MYR . YB Tan Sri Iman Rayyan Stated That This Will Not Only Help Local Companies To Be Internationally Recognise but will help Malaysia emerge as one of the worlds leading tech nation with South Korea , United States , Taiwan , Japan and China competing for the top spot.

Toward this end, leading edge technologies were used, some with mixed results. In addition to the successful implementation of the above-mentioned Cyberjaya Dedicated Transportation System, the Cyberjaya blog is another example of the technology-based features that have been put in place.

===Communications===
To support the aspiration to host multimedia industries, Cyberjaya was specified with extensive and intensive [[fibre optic]] cabling. As Malaysia's premier IT hub, Cyberjaya has a telecommunication backbone running primarily on fibre optics known as Cyberjaya Metro Fibre Network (CMFN). Operated by Setia Haruman Technology Sdn Bhd, CMFN is a carrier neutral and open access infrastructure where multi-leading Telco/Carriers/ISPs are riding on CMFN's fibre optic network to provide their services to end customers in Cyberjaya. CMFN delivers fibre connectivity straight to the building under the concepts of "Fibre-To-The-Building ([[FTTB]])" and "Fibre-To-The-Home ([[FTTH]])". As such, most of the commercial buildings and offices are connected to CMFN. With the ring topology; CMFN offers full redundancy throughout the network – with the availability of high capacity and resiliency network, many data centres are located here and connected to CMFN. However, some older commercial and residential units still use copper lines to provide "last mile" access to customers. Broadband access covering wireless and fixed line is readily available. Broadband access is serviced primarily by Cyberjaya Broadband (Ethernet Broadband-Over-Fibreoptic), Time, [[TMnet]], MyKris, NTT MSC (formerly ARCnet) and recently [[Air Broadband]] which has announced its test pilot plans in Cyberjaya for [[Wimax]].

===Backup electrical supply===
The Cyberjaya planning guidelines strongly required two electricity connections from two separate substations. Diesel generators up to full load (except air conditioning load) were specified to be installed in all commercial buildings. The electricity grid connection was also organised to enable "power [[islanding]]" and supported by the [[Serdang Power Station]]. The electricity service standard is set at 99.99% availability with maximum of 10 seconds interruption for office and commercial areas and maximum 15 minutes interruption for residential areas. These measures were dreamed up to provide Cyberjaya with a comparative advantage against other areas outside the Multimedia Super Corridor. However, Tenaga Nasional has extended the same standard to all urban areas connected to the [[National Grid (Malaysia)|National Grid in Malaysia]].

On 26 June 2007, despite the advertised preparedness, Cyberjaya experienced a citywide power outage for more than 30 minutes. No official reason was given for the outage.

===District cooling ===
The use of district cooling system, where chilled water from a central plant is provided to run the air conditioning, was laid extensively in the central district. The promise is the economical use of off-peak electricity at night to chill water for the air conditioning use during the day. Pendinginan Megajana Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Cyberview, is the provider for this service.

===Data centres===
Several [[data centre]]s operate in Cyberjaya. Notable are those operated by T-systems for Shell, NTT MSC, BMW and DHL. A small scale Data Centre ideal for Small &amp; Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is located at City Command Center Cyberjaya (CCC) Data Centre that provides Rack Location Unit (RLU) space rental and server co-location. There are also carrier neutral, high-end purpose built data centre facilities in Cyberjaya such as CX1, CX2 and CX5 – managed by CSF Advisers (a member of CSF Group plc CSF Group), Basis Bay and MyTelehaus. There are also few government agencies' purpose built data centre facilities in Cyberjaya such as managed by Central Bank (Bank Negara Malaysia) and Road Transport Department. Malaysia's incumbent Telco, Telekom Malaysia (TM) also has it purpose built data centre facilities in Cyberjaya.

===Call centres===
Several [[call centre]]s &amp; [[service desk]] operate in Cyberjaya. Notables are those operated by [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[HSBC]].

===Office space===
Initially 8 blocks of office buildings were built by the developer. These are purpose built for multimedia companies by being provided extra height ceiling and under floor trunking (some with [[raised floor]]), [[fibre optic]] wiring, dual redundant power supply, [[uninterruptible power supply]] and back up generators for whole electricity load, which common practice in Malaysia is only to 30% load.

Presently, there are more than 30 completed office buildings in Cyberjaya catering for multi tenants as well as single tenants. The presence of Government agencies will also increase once the Bank Negara Data Centre and Road and Transport Department's IT Centre buildings are completed.

This city is also looking forward to the development of the Knowledge Workers Development Institute (KWDI) and the Creative Multimedia Cluster, both by Cyberview, which are targeted for completion in 2009.

MKN Embassy Techzone, is a freehold ICT business park project on approximately {{convert|41|acre|ha}} of prime Cyberjaya land in the flagship zone aimed for lease to multinational companies. The project is developed by MKN Embassy Development Sdn. Bhd., a joint venture company between EMKAY Group of Malaysia and Embassy Group of India, who is as a strategic partner for EMKAY group in the development of this specialised ICT building.

===Cyberjaya-TV===
Cyberjaya-TV was conceived in late 2009 in an effort to showcase Cyberjaya's "Live, Study, Work &amp; Play" elements.  Contents developed, primarily, relate to Cyberjaya which provides a mean for people all over the world to sample part of the thriving Cyberjaya community.
Cyberjaya TV no longer operating.

===Education===

Cyberjaya also plays host to a number of schools, colleges and Universities.  These include [[Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Cyberjaya]], ELC International School, [[Multimedia University]] (MMU),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=www.mmu.edu.my|publisher=Multimedia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kirkby International College]], [http://cybermed.edu.my/ Cyberjaya University College of Medical Sciences] (CyberjayaUC), FTMS and LimKokWing University of Creative Technology (LUCT).

The '''Czochralski process''' is a method of [[crystal growth]] used to obtain [[single crystal]]s of [[semiconductors]] (e.g. [[silicon]], [[germanium]] and [[gallium arsenide]]), metals (e.g. [[palladium]], [[platinum]], [[silver]], [[gold]]), salts and synthetic [[gemstone]]s. The process is named after Polish scientist [[Jan Czochralski]],&lt;ref&gt;(Polish), (English), Paweł Tomaszewski, ""Jan Czochralski i jego metoda" (ang.Jan Czochralski and his method), Oficyna Wydawnicza ATUT, Wrocław–Kcynia 2003, {{ISBN|83-89247-27-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; who invented the method in 1915 while investigating the crystallization rates of metals.&lt;ref&gt;J. Czochralski (1918) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x030529785;view=1up;seq=227 "Ein neues Verfahren zur Messung der Kristallisationsgeschwindigkeit der Metalle"] [A new method for the measurement of the crystallization rate of metals], ''Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie'', '''92''' : 219–221.&lt;/ref&gt; He made this discovery by accident, while studying the crystallization rate of [[metals]] when, instead of dipping his pen into the ink, he did so in molten [[tin]] and drew a [[tin]] filament, that later proved to be a [[single crystal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nishinaga|first1=Tatau|title=Handbook of Crystal Growth: Fundamentals|date=2015|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|location=Amsterdam, the Netherlands|isbn=978-0-444-56369-9|page=21|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important application may be the growth of large cylindrical [[ingot]]s, or [[boule (crystal)|boules]], of [[Monocrystalline silicon|single crystal silicon]] used in the electronics industry to make [[semiconductor device]]s like [[integrated circuit]]s. Other semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, can also be grown by this method, although lower defect densities in this case can be obtained using variants of the [[Bridgman-Stockbarger technique]].

== Application ==

[[Monocrystalline silicon]] (mono-Si) grown by the ''Czochralski process'' is often referred to as ''monocrystalline Czochralski silicon'' (Cz-Si). It is the basic material in the production of [[integrated circuits]] used in computers, TVs, mobile phones and all types of electronic equipment and [[semiconductor devices]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A912151 Czochralski Crystal Growth Method]. Bbc.co.uk. 30 January 2003. Retrieved on 2011-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Monocrystalline silicon is also used in large quantities by the [[photovoltaic]] industry for the production of [[crystalline silicon|conventional]] mono-Si [[solar cell]]s. The almost perfect crystal structure yields the highest light-to-electricity conversion efficiency for silicon.

== Production of Czochralski silicon ==
[[File:Monokristalines Silizium für die Waferherstellung.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.4|Crystal of Czochralski grown silicon.]]

High-purity, [[semiconductor]]-grade silicon (only a few parts per million of impurities) is melted in a [[crucible]] at {{Convert|1425|C|F K}}, usually made of [[quartz]]. Dopant impurity atoms such as [[boron]] or [[phosphorus]] can be added to the molten silicon in precise amounts to [[Doping (semiconductor)|dope]] the silicon, thus changing it into [[P-type semiconductor|p-type]] or [[N-type semiconductor|n-type]] silicon, with different electronic properties. A precisely oriented rod-mounted [[seed crystal]] is dipped into the molten silicon. The seed crystal's rod is slowly pulled upwards and rotated simultaneously. By precisely controlling the temperature gradients, rate of pulling and speed of rotation, it is possible to extract a large, single-crystal, cylindrical ingot from the melt. Occurrence of unwanted instabilities in the melt can be avoided by investigating and visualizing the temperature and velocity fields during the crystal growth process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jalena |last1=Aleksic |title=Temperature and Flow Visualization in a Simulation of the Czochralski Process Using Temperature-Sensitive Liquid Crystals |journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci.]] |volume=972 |issue= |year=2002 |pages=158 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb04567.x |bibcode = 2002NYASA.972..158A |first2=Paul |last2= Zielke |last3=Szymczyk |first3=Janusz A. |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is normally performed in an [[Inert gas|inert]] atmosphere, such as [[argon]], in an inert chamber, such as quartz.

== Crystal sizes==

The induction heating coil is visible, and the end of the crystal just emerging from the melt. The technician is measuring the temperature with an [[optical pyrometer]]. One of the earliest Si plants, the crystals produced by this early apparatus were only one inch in diameter.]]

Due to the efficiencies of common [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] specifications, the semiconductor industry has used wafers with standardized dimensions. In the early days, the boules were smaller, only a few inches wide. With advanced technology, high-end device manufacturers use 200&amp;nbsp;mm and 300&amp;nbsp;mm diameter wafers. The width is controlled by precise control of the temperature, the speeds of rotation and the speed the seed holder is withdrawn. The crystal ingots from which these wafers are sliced can be up to 2 metres in length, weighing several hundred kilograms. Larger wafers allow improvements in manufacturing efficiency, as more chips can be fabricated on each wafer, so there has been a steady drive to increase silicon wafer sizes. The next step up, 450&amp;nbsp;mm, is currently scheduled for introduction in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/doubts-over-450mm-and-euv-2013-12/ Doubts over 450mm and EUV]. Electronicsweekly.com. December 30, 2013. Retrieved on 2014-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon wafers are typically about 0.2–0.75&amp;nbsp;mm thick, and can be polished to great flatness for making [[integrated circuit]]s or textured for making [[solar cell]]s.

The process begins when the chamber is heated to approximately 1500 degrees Celsius, melting the silicon. When the silicon is fully melted, a small seed crystal mounted on the end of a rotating shaft is slowly lowered until it just dips below the surface of the molten silicon. The shaft rotates counterclockwise and the crucible rotates clockwise. The rotating rod is then drawn upwards very slowly—about 25&amp;nbsp;mm per hour when making a crystal of ruby&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;—allowing a roughly cylindrical boule to be formed. The boule can be from one to two metres, depending on the amount of silicon in the crucible.

The electrical characteristics of the silicon are controlled by adding material like phosphorus or boron to the silicon before it is melted. The added material is called dopant and the process is called doping. This method is also used with semiconductor materials other than silicon, such as gallium arsenide.

==Incorporating impurities==
[[Image:Silicon seed crystal puller rod.jpg|thumb|A puller rod with [[seed crystal]] for growing [[single-crystal silicon]] by the Czochralski process.]]

When silicon is grown by the Czochralski method, the melt is contained in a [[silica]] ([[quartz]]) crucible. During growth, the walls of the crucible dissolve into the melt and Czochralski silicon therefore contains [[oxygen]] at a typical concentration of 10{{su|p=18}}&amp;nbsp;cm{{su|p=−3}}. Oxygen impurities can have beneficial or detrimental effects. Carefully chosen annealing conditions can give rise to the formation of oxygen [[precipitates]]. These have the effect of trapping unwanted [[transition metal]] impurities in a process known as [[gettering]], improving the purity of surrounding silicon. However, formation of oxygen [[precipitates]] at unintended locations can also destroy electrical structures. Additionally, oxygen impurities can improve the mechanical strength of silicon wafers by immobilising any [[dislocations]] which may be introduced during device processing. It was experimentally shown in the 1990s that the high oxygen concentration is also beneficial for the [[radiation hardness]] of silicon [[particle detector]]s used in harsh radiation environment (such as [[CERN]]'s [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]]/[[High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider|HL-LHC]] projects).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/23.211360 |title=Investigation of the oxygen-vacancy (A-center) defect complex profile in neutron irradiated high resistivity silicon junction particle detectors|year=1992|last1=Li|first1=Z.|last2=Kraner|first2=H.W.|last3=Verbitskaya|first3=E.|last4=Eremin|first4=V.|last5=Ivanov|first5=A.|last6=Rattaggi|first6=M.|last7=Rancoita|first7=P.G.|last8=Rubinelli|first8=F.A.|last9=Fonash|first9=S.J.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science|volume=39|issue=6|pages=1730|bibcode = 1992ITNS...39.1730L |display-authors=9 |last10=Dale |first10=C. |last11=Marshall |first11=P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0168-9002(01)00560-5|title=Radiation hard silicon detectors—developments by the RD48 (ROSE) collaboration|year=2001|last1=Lindström|first1=G|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment|volume=466|issue=2|pages=308|bibcode = 2001NIMPA.466..308L |last2=Ahmed|first2=M|last3=Albergo|first3=S|last4=Allport|first4=P|last5=Anderson|first5=D|last6=Andricek|first6=L|last7=Angarano|first7=M.M|last8=Augelli|first8=V|last9=Bacchetta|first9=N|last10=Bartalini|first10=P|last11=Bates|first11=R|last12=Biggeri|first12=U|last13=Bilei|first13=G.M|last14=Bisello|first14=D|last15=Boemi|first15=D|last16=Borchi|first16=E|last17=Botila|first17=T|last18=Brodbeck|first18=T.J|last19=Bruzzi|first19=M|last20=Budzynski|first20=T|last21=Burger|first21=P|last22=Campabadal|first22=F|last23=Casse|first23=G|last24=Catacchini|first24=E|last25=Chilingarov|first25=A|last26=Ciampolini|first26=P|last27=Cindro|first27=V|last28=Costa|first28=M.J|last29=Creanza|first29=D|last30=Clauws|first30=P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, radiation detectors made of Czochralski- and Magnetic Czochralski-silicon are considered to be promising candidates for many future [[high-energy physics]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;CERN RD50 Status Report 2004, CERN-LHCC-2004-031 and LHCC-RD-005 and cited literature therein&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.nima.2005.01.057|title=Particle detectors made of high-resistivity Czochralski silicon|year=2005|last1=Harkonen|first1=J|last2=Tuovinen|first2=E|last3=Luukka|first3=P|last4=Tuominen|first4=E|last5=Li|first5=Z|last6=Ivanov|first6=A|last7=Verbitskaya|first7=E|last8=Eremin|first8=V|last9=Pirojenko|first9=A|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment|volume=541|pages=202|bibcode = 2005NIMPA.541..202H |last10=Riihimaki|first10=I.|last11=Virtanen|first11=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that the presence of oxygen in silicon increases impurity trapping during post-implantation annealing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.356173|title=Erbium in crystal silicon: Segregation and trapping during solid phase epitaxy of amorphous silicon|year=1994|last1=Custer|first1=J.

However, oxygen impurities can react with boron in an illuminated environment, such as that experienced by solar cells. This results in the formation of an electrically active boron–oxygen complex that detracts from cell performance. Module output drops by approximately 3% during the first few hours of light exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Eikelboom, J.A., Jansen, M.J., 2000.

The impurity concentration in the solid crystal that results from freezing an amount of volume can be obtained from consideration of the segregation coefficient.

:&lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt;: Initial volume

:&lt;math&gt;I_L&lt;/math&gt;: Number of impurities in the melt

:&lt;math&gt;V_S&lt;/math&gt;: Volume of solid

{{Forms of government}}
{{Politics}}
'''E-government''' (short for [[electronics|electronic]] [[government]]) is the use of electronic communications devices, [[computer]]s and the [[Internet]] to provide public services to citizens and other persons in a country or region. According to Jeong, 2007 the term consists of the digital interactions between a citizen and their government (C2G), between governments and other government agencies (G2G), between government and citizens (G2C), between government and employees (G2E), and between government and businesses/commerces (G2B). E-government delivery models can be broken down into the following categories:&lt;ref name="JeongChunHai"&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim. (2007). ''Fundamental of Development Administration.'' Selangor: Scholar Press. {{ISBN|978-967-5-04508-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interaction consists of citizens communicating with all levels of government (city, state/province, national, and international), facilitating citizen involvement in [[governance]] using [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) (such as computers and [[website]]s) and [[business process re-engineering]] (BPR). Brabham and Guth (2017) interviewed the third party designers of e-government tools in North America about the ideals of user interaction that they build into their technologies, which include progressive values, ubiquitous participation, geolocation, and education of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brabham|first=Daren C.|last2=Guth|first2=Kristen L.|date=2017-08-01|title=The Deliberative Politics of the Consultative Layer: Participation Hopes and Communication as Design Values of Civic Tech Founders|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12316/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=67|issue=4|pages=445–475|doi=10.1111/jcom.12316|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other definitions are more away from technology as an object, to see them simply as facilitators or instruments and focus on specific changes in Public Administration issues, and in the internal transformation of a Government, is the case of the definition that established the specialist technologist Mauro D. Ríos in the paper "In search of a definition of Electronic Government", he says: "Digital Government is a new way of organization and management of public affairs, introducing positive transformational processes in management and the structure itself of the organization chart, adding value to the procedures and services provided, all through the introduction and continued appropriation of information and communication technologies as a facilitator of these transformations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://novagob.org/en-busca-de-una-definicia3n-de-gobierno-electra3nico/|title=En busca de una definición de Gobierno Electrónico – NovaGob|website=novagob.org|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
E-government is also known as e-gov, electronic government, Internet governance, digital government, online government, connected government. As of 2014 the [[OECD]] still uses the term digital government, and distinguishes it from e-government in the recommendation produced there for the Network on E-Government of the Public Governance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several governments have started to use the term digital government to a wide range of services involving contemporary technology, such as big data, automation or predictive analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apolitical.co/flagship/big-data-and-digital-government/|title=Tech and data: can 'digital government' be radically smarter?|website=Apolitical|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
''E-gov strategies'' (or ''digital government'') is defined as "The employment of the Internet and the world-wide-web for delivering government information and services to the citizens." (United Nations, 2006; AOEMA, 2005).&lt;ref name="UNEGovSurvey2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''Electronic government'' (or ''e-government'') essentially refers to "utilization of [[Information Technology]] (IT), Information and Communication Technologies (ICT s), and other web-based telecommunication technologies to improve and/or enhance on the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery in the public sector.".&lt;ref name="JeongChunHai" /&gt; E-government promotes and improves broad stakeholders contribution to national and community development, as well as deepen the governance process.&lt;ref name="Egov"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alenezi |first1=Hussain |last2=Tarhini |first2=Ali |last3=Sharma |first3=Sujeet Kumar |title=Development of quantitative model to investigate the strategic relationship between information quality and e-government benefits |journal=Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy |date=2015 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=324–351 |doi=10.1108/TG-01-2015-0004 |url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/TG-01-2015-0004 |accessdate=5 January 2016 |ref=(Alenzi et al., 2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In electronic government systems, government operations are supported by web-based services. It involves the use of information technology, specifically the Internet, to facilitate the communication between the government and its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csi-sigegov.orgwww.csi-sigegov.org/1/1_369.pdf|title=E-Government and E-Governance: Definitions/Domain|last=Jain Palvia|first=Shailendra|date=|website=csi-sigegov.org|publisher=Computer Society of India|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN e-Government Development Index==

The Division of a Public Administration and Development Management (DPAPM) of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA) conducts a bi-annual e-government survey which includes a section titled ''e-Government Development Index (EGDI)''. It is a comparative ranking of 193 countries of the world according to three primary indicators: i) the OSI - Online Service Index that measures the online presence of the government in terms of service delivery; ii) the TII - Telecommunication Infrastructure Index iii) HCI -Human Capital Index . Constructing a model for the measurement of digitized services, the Survey assesses the 193 member states of the UN according to a quantitative composite index of e-government readiness based on website assessment; telecommunication infrastructure and human resource endowment.&lt;ref name="UNEGovSurvey2016" /&gt;

A diverse group of 100 researchers [[Online volunteering|online volunteers]] from across the globe engaged with the United Nations Department of Economic Affairs (UN DESA) to process 386 research surveys carried out across 193 [[UN Member States]] for the 2016 UN E-Government Survey.&lt;ref name="egovsurvey16"&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 UN E-Government Survey|url=https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey-2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of nationalities and languages of the online volunteers&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinevolunteering.org/en/org/stories/2013_undesa.html Online Volunteering service, Experiences]&lt;/ref&gt;—more than 65 languages, 15 nationalities, of which half are from developing countries—mirrors perfectly the mission of the survey.

==Comparison with e-governance==
{{main|e-governance}}
E-government should enable anyone visiting a city website to communicate and interact with city employees via the Internet with graphical user interfaces (GUI), instant-messaging (IM), learn about government issues through audio/video presentations, and in any way more sophisticated than a simple email letter to the address provided at the site”&lt;ref&gt;Kaylor, C., Deshazo, R. and Van Eck, D.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of [[e-governance]] is "The enhanced value for stakeholders through transformation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0740-624X(01)00089-2 | volume=18 | title=Gauging e-government: A report on implementing services among American cities | year=2001 | journal=Government Information Quarterly | pages=293–307 | last1 = Kaylor | first1 = Charles | last2 = Deshazo | first2 = Randy | last3 = Van Eck | first3 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “the use of technology to enhance the access to and delivery of government services to benefit citizens, business partners and employees”.&lt;ref&gt;Deloitte Research – Public Sector Institute [http://www.egov.vic.gov.au/pdfs/e-government.pdf At the Dawn of e-Government: The Citizen as Customer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706122814/http://www.egov.vic.gov.au/pdfs/e-government.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The focus should be on:
* The use of [[information and communication technologies]], and particularly the Internet, as a tool to achieve better government.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/60/60/2502539.pdf The e-government imperative: main findings], Policy Brief, Public Affairs Division, Public Affairs and Communications Directorate, OECD, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of information and communication technologies in all facets of the operations of a government organization.&lt;ref&gt;Grima-Izquierdo, C. (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/A-generic-architecture-eGovernment-eDemocracy/dp/3848437627 A generic architecture for e-Government and e-Democracy: requirements, design and security risk analysis]. Ed. LAP Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Koh, C.E. |author2=Prybutok, V.R. |title=The three-ring model and development of an instrument for measuring dimensions of e-government functions|journal= Journal of Computer Information Systems|volume= 33|issue=3|pages=34–9|year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The continuous optimization of service delivery, constituency participation, and governance by transforming internal and external relationships through technology, the Internet and new media.&lt;ref&gt;Gartner Group, “Key Issues in E-Government Strategy and Management,” Research Notes, Key Issues, 23 May 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
Whilst e-government has traditionally been understood as being centered around the operations of government, e-governance is understood to extend the scope by including citizen engagement and participation in governance. As such, following in line with the OECD definition of e-government, e-governance can be defined as the use of ICTs as a tool to achieve better governance.

==Delivery models and activities of e-government==
The primary delivery models of e-government can be divided into:
* [[G2C|Government-to-citizen]] or government-to-consumer (G2C) approaches such as setting up [[website]]s where citizens can download forms, government information, etc.
** In this model, the G2C model applies the strategy of [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) with business concept.
** By managing their "customer" (citizen) relationship, the business (government) can provide the needed products and services fulfill the needs of the customer (citizen).
** In United States, the NPR ([[National Partnership for Reinventing Government]]) has been implemented from 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, B., &amp; Milakovich, M. (January 1, 2005). Citizen Relationship Management and E-Government. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3591, 57–68&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Government-to-business]] (G2B)
* [[Government-to-government]] (G2G)
* [[Government-to-employees]] (G2E)

Within each of these interaction domains, four kinds of activities take place:&lt;ref&gt;Mary Maureen Brown. "Electronic Government" Jack Rabin (ed.). ''Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy'', Marcel Dekker, 2003, pp. 427–432 {{ISBN|0824742400}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-10|url=http://www.iceg.net/2007/books/1/1_369.pdf|publisher=ICEG|title=E-Government and E-Governance: Definitions/Domain Framework and Status around the World|format=PDF|author1=Shailendra C. Jain Palvia |author2=Sushil S. Sharma |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* pushing information over the Internet, e.g.: regulatory services, general holidays, public hearing schedules, issue briefs, notifications, etc.
* two-way communications between the agency and the citizen, a business, or another government agency. In this model, users can engage in dialogue with agencies and post problems, comments, or requests to the agency.
* conducting transactions, e.g.: lodging tax returns, applying for services and grants.
* governance, e.g.: To enable the citizen transition from passive information access to active citizen participation by:
# Informing the citizen
# Representing the citizen
# Encouraging the citizen to vote
# Consulting the citizen
# Involving the citizen

==Non-internet e-government==
While e-government is often thought of as "online government" or "Internet-based government," many non-Internet "electronic government" technologies can be used in this context. Some non-Internet forms include [[telephone]], [[fax]], [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]], [[Short message service|SMS]] text messaging, [[Multimedia Messaging System|MMS]], wireless networks and services, [[Bluetooth]], [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]], tracking systems, [[RFID]], [[biometric]] identification, road traffic management and regulatory enforcement, [[identity cards]], [[smart cards]] and other [[near field communication]] applications; polling station technology (where non-online [[e-voting]] is being considered), TV and radio-based delivery of government services (e.g., [[Control System Middleware for operator functioning (CSMW)|CSMW]]), email, [[online community]] facilities, [[newsgroup]]s and [[electronic mailing list]]s, [[online chat]], and [[instant messenger|instant messaging]] technologies.

== Controversies ==

===Disadvantages===
The main disadvantages concerning e-government is the lack of equality in public access to computers and the internet (the "[[digital divide]]", a reference to the fact that people who have low incomes, who are [[homeless]] and/or who live in remote regions may have little or no access to the Internet), reliability of information on the web, and issues that could influence and bias public opinions. There are many considerations and potential implications of implementing and designing e-government, including [[disintermediation]] of the government and its citizens, impacts on economic, social, and political factors, vulnerability to [[cyber attack]]s, and disturbances to the ''status quo'' in these areas.&lt;ref name="information137"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Atkinson | first1 = Robert D. | last2 = Castro | first2 = Daniel | title = Digital Quality of Life | publisher = The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation | pages = 137–145 | year = 2008 | url=http://www.itif.org/files/DQOL-14.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Electronic leviathan]].

The political nature of public sector forms are also cited as disadvantages to e-government systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eldis.org/go/topics/resource-guides/governance/key-issues/e-government/challenges-for-e-government#.WE-RiJMrJAY|title=Challenges for e-government|last=Collodi|first=Jason|date=|website=eldis.org/|publisher=Institute of Development Studies|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trust ===
Trust in e-governance is very highly dependent on its performance and execution, which can be measured through the effectiveness of current actions. This is much riskier and prone to fluctuation than a system of trust that is based on reputation because performance does not consider past actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=E-Governance and Civic Engagement: Factors and Determinants of E-Democracy|last=Manoharan|first=Aroon|publisher=IGI Global|year=2011|isbn=161350084X|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
Because E-government is in the early stages of development in many countries and jurisdictions, it is hard to be applied to forms of government that have been institutionalized. Age-old bureaucratic practices being delivered in new mediums or using new technologies can lead to problems of miscommunication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csi-sigegov.orgwww.csi-sigegov.org/1/1_369.pdf |title =E-Government and E-Governance: Definitions/Domain Framework and Status around the World | author= Palvia, Shailendra and Sharma, Sushil|accessdate=2017-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hyper-surveillance====
Increased electronic contact and data exchange between government and its citizens goes both ways. Once e-government technologies become more sophisticated, citizens will be likely be encouraged to interact electronically with the government for more transactions, as e-services are much less costly than [[bricks and mortar]] service offices (physical buildings) staffed by [[civil servant]]s. This could potentially lead to a decrease in privacy for civilians as the government obtains more and more information about their activities. Without safeguards, government agencies might share information on citizens. In a worst-case scenario, with so much information being passed electronically between government and civilians, a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]-like system could develop. When the government has easy access to countless information on its citizens, personal [[privacy]] is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/48629.html?wlc=1235202183 |title=AT&amp;T Sued for Role in Aiding US Government Surveillance |publisher=TechNewsWorld |author=Lyman, Jay |date=2006-02-01 |accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/08/analysis-new-la.html |title=Analysis: New Law Gives Government Six Months to Turn Internet and Phone Systems into Permanent Spying Architecture |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |author=Singel, Ryan |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cost====
Although "a prodigious amount of money has been spent"&lt;ref&gt;The good, the bad and the inevitable | The Economist http://www.economist.com/node/10638105&lt;/ref&gt; on the development and implementation of e-government, some say{{Who|date=February 2014}} it has yielded only a mediocre result. The outcomes and effects of trial Internet-based government services are often difficult to gauge or users seem them unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?STORY_ID=10638105 |title=The pros and cons of e-government |publisher=Economist |date=2008-02-14 |accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Gartner, Worldwide IT spending is estimated to total $3.6 trillion in 2011 which is 5.1% increase from the year 2010 ($3.4 trillion).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1513614 |title=Global IT Spending |publisher= Gartner |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inaccessibility====
{{Main|Digital divide}}
An e-government website that provides government services often does not offer the "potential to reach many users including those who live in remote areas [without Internet access], are homebound, have low literacy levels, exist on poverty line incomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igi-pub.com/files/prefaces/jeco%20preface%201(3).pdf |title=Bridging Literacy, Language, and Cultural Divides to Promote Universal Usability of E-Government Websites |publisher=[[Northern Arizona University]] |author=Becker, Shirley A. |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[homelessness|Homeless]] people, people in poverty and elderly people may not have access.

====False sense of transparency and accountability====
Opponents of e-government argue that online governmental transparency is dubious because it is maintained by the governments themselves. Information can be added or removed from the public eye. To this day, very few organizations monitor and provide accountability for these modifications. Those that do so, like the United States’ OMBWatch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ombwatch.org/ |title=ombwatch.org |publisher=ombwatch.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104170904/http://www.ombwatch.org/ |archivedate=2013-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Government Accountability Project]], are often nonprofit volunteers. Even the governments themselves do not always keep track of the information they insert and delete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pcworld.about.com/news/Sep112002id104796.htm |title=Has Terrorism Curtailed E-Government? |publisher=Medill News Service |author=Chiger, Stephen |date=2002-09-11 |accessdate=2009-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904235925/http://pcworld.about.com/news/Sep112002id104796.htm |archivedate=2008-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===

The ultimate goal of the e-government is to be able to offer an increased portfolio of public services to citizens in an efficient and cost effective manner. E-government allows for government transparency. Government transparency is important because it allows the public to be informed about what the government is working on as well as the policies they are trying to implement.
Simple tasks may be easier to perform through electronic government access. Many changes, such as marital status or address changes can be a long process and take a lot of paper work for citizens. E-government allows these tasks to be performed efficiently with more convenience to individuals.
E-government is an easy way for the public to be more involved in political campaigns. It could increase voter awareness, which could lead to an increase in citizen participation in elections.
It is convenient and cost-effective for businesses, and the public benefits by getting easy access to the most current information available without having to spend time, energy and money to get it.

E-government helps simplify processes and makes government information more easily accessible for public sector agencies and citizens. For example, the [[Indiana]] Bureau of Motor Vehicles simplified the process of certifying driver records to be admitted in county court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in.gov/bmv/ Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles]. In.gov (2009-06-16). Retrieved on 2012-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indiana]] became the first state to allow government records to be digitally signed, legally certified and delivered electronically by using Electronic Postmark technology. In addition to its simplicity, [[e-democracy]] services can reduce costs. [[Alabama]] Department of Conservation &amp; Natural Resources, [[Wal-Mart]] and NIC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicusa.com |title=nicusa.com |publisher=nicusa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an online hunting and fishing license service utilizing an existing computer to automate the licensing process. More than 140,000 licenses were purchased at [[Wal-Mart]] stores during the first hunting season and the agency estimates it will save $200,000 annually from service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_GovTech-Aug05.pdf |title=Picking Up the Tab |publisher=Government Technology |date=September 2005 |accessdate=2009-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821131811/http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_GovTech-Aug05.pdf |archivedate=August 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anticipated benefits of e-government include efficiency, improved services, better accessibility of public services, sustainable community development and more transparency and accountability.&lt;ref name="information137"/&gt;

====Democratization====
{{Main|E-democracy}}
One goal of some e-government initiatives is greater citizen participation. Through the Internet's [[Web 2.0]] interactive features, people from all over the country can provide input to politicians or public servants and make their voices heard. [[Blog]]ging and interactive surveys allow politicians or public servants to see the views of the people on any issue. [[Chat room]]s can place citizens in real-time contact with elected officials or their office staff or provide them with the means to interact directly with public servants, allowing voters to have a direct impact and influence in their government. These technologies can create a more transparent government, allowing voters to immediately see how and why their representatives in the capital are voting the way they are. This helps voters decide whom to vote for in the future or how to help the public servants become more productive.

A government could theoretically move more towards a true [[democracy]] with the proper application of e-government. [[Open government|Government transparency]] will give insight to the public on how decisions are made and hold elected officials or public servants accountable for their actions. The public could become a direct and prominent influence in government legislature to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/ericjsinrod/2004-06-30-sinrod_x.htm |title=A look at the pros and cons of e-government |publisher=[[USA Today]] |author=Sinrod, Eric J. |date=2004-06-30 |accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/417520 |title=How Web 2.0 Will Transform Local Government |publisher=Digital Communities |author=Schrier, Bill |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2008-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023020229/http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/417520 |archivedate=2008-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdt.org/egov/handbook/transparency.shtml |title=Transparency |publisher=Center for Democracy &amp; Technology |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315105326/http://cdt.org/egov/handbook/transparency.shtml |archivedate=2009-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zenergyglobal.com/lib/facilitating-effective-online-participation-in-e-government-Thorpe.pdf |title=Facilitating effective online participation in e-government |publisher=E-government in [[New Zealand]] |author=Thorpe, Stephen J. |date=2008-06-23 |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520221620/http://www.zenergyglobal.com/lib/facilitating-effective-online-participation-in-e-government-Thorpe.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental bonuses====
{{Main|Paperless office}}
Proponents of e-government argue that online government services would lessen the need for hard copy paper forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yourpenntrafford.com/penntraffordstar/article/so-how-much-paper-does-our-local-government-use |title=So, how much paper does our local government use? |publisher=Penn-Trafford Star |author=Dezayas, Heidi |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2008-03-01 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to recent pressures from [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] groups, the media, and the public, some governments and organizations have turned to the Internet to reduce paper use. The United States government utilizes the website http://www.forms.gov to provide “internal government forms for federal employees” and thus “produce significant savings in paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/egov_docs/FY09_Benefits_Report.pdf |title=Report to Congress on the Benefits of the President's E-Government Initiatives ("Business Gateway," p. 50) |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226145709/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/egov_docs/FY09_Benefits_Report.pdf |archivedate=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, if citizens can apply for government services or permits online, they may not need to drive into a government office, which could lead to less [[air pollution]] from gas and diesel-fuelled vehicles.

====Speed, efficiency, and convenience====
E-government allows citizens to interact with computers to achieve objectives at any time and any location and eliminates the necessity for physical travel to government agents sitting behind desks and windows. Many e-government services are available to citizens with computers and Internet access 24 hours a day and seven days a week, in contrast to [[bricks and mortar]] government offices, which tend to be only open during [[business hour]]s (notable exceptions are [[police station]]s and [[hospital]]s, which are usually open 24 hours a day so that staff can deal with emergencies).

Improved accounting and record keeping can be noted through computerization, and information and forms can be easily accessed by citizens with computers and Internet access, which may enable quicker processing time for applications and find information. On the administrative side, access to help find or retrieve files and linked information can now be stored in electronic databases versus hard copies (paper copies) stored in various locations. Individuals with disabilities or conditions that affect their mobility no longer have to be mobile to be active in government and can access public services in the comfort of their own homes&lt;ref&gt;Satyanarayana, J. ''E-Government: The Science of the Possible.'' India: Prentice Hall, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Nixon | first1 = Paul G. | last2 = Rawal | first2 = Rajash | title = Enabling Democracy? e-Government, Inclusion and Citizenship | publisher = The Hague University | pages = 281–290 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=eC60D0q7m0AC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;dq=cons+of+e-government | isbn = 978-1-905305-11-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as long as they have a computer and Internet and any accessibility equipment they may need).

====Public approval====
{{Main|e-participation}}
Recent trials of e-government have been met with acceptance and eagerness from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070426005159/en/Study-Finds-Federal-Gains-Electronic-Government-Citizen |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180613111852/https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070426005159/en/Study-Finds-Federal-Gains-Electronic-Government-Citizen |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2018-06-13 |title= Study Finds Federal Gains in Electronic Government and Citizen Services; Challenges Remain |publisher= Bearing Point |date= 2007-04-26 |accessdate= 2009-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Urdiales | first1 = C. | last2 = de Trazegnies | first2 = C. | last3 = Salceda | first3 = J.

Although Internet-based governmental programs have been criticized for lack of reliable privacy policies, studies have shown that people value prosecution of offenders over personal confidentiality. Ninety percent of United States adults approve of Internet tracking systems of criminals, and 57% are willing to forgo some of their personal [[internet privacy]] if it leads to the prosecution of criminals or terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pcworld.about.com/news/Mar122002id88684.htm |title=How Much Government Snooping Is Okay? |publisher=Medill News Service |author=Roy, Saumya |date=2002-03-12 |accessdate=2009-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023161650/http://pcworld.about.com/news/Mar122002id88684.htm |archivedate=2008-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology-specific e-government==
There are also some technology-specific sub-categories of e-government, such as [[m-government]] (mobile government), ubiquitous government), and g-government ([[GIS]]/[[GPS]] applications for e-government).

The previous concern about developments in E-government concerning technology are due to the limited use of online platforms for political reasons by citizens in local political participations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mossberger|first=Karen|year=2009|title=CAN E-GOVERNMENT PROMOTE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT?|url=https://ipce.uic.edu/interior/egovtfinalreport2009.pdf|journal=Institute for Policy and Civic Engagement|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary delivery models of e-government are classified depending on who benefits. In the development of public sector or private sector portals and platforms, a system is created that benefits all constituents. Citizens needing to renew their vehicle registration have a convenient way to accomplish it while already engaged in meeting the regulatory inspection requirement. On behalf of a government partner, the business provides what has traditionally, and solely, managed by government and can use this service to generate profit or attract new customers. Government agencies are relieved of the cost and complexity of having to process the transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Government Technology’s Public CIO Thought Leadership Profile [http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_PublicCIO-Aug06.pdf "Expanding eGovernment, Every Day"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326054720/http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/EGOV_PublicCIO-Aug06.pdf |date=2010-03-26 }} open-access online paper 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

To develop these public sector portals or platforms, governments have the choice to internally develop and manage, outsource, or sign a self-funding contract. The self-funding model creates portals that pay for themselves through convenience fees for certain e-government transactions, known as self-funding portals.

[[Social networking service]]s and websites are an emerging area for e-democracy. The social networking entry point is within the citizens’ environment and the engagement is on the citizens’ terms. Proponents of e-government perceive government use of social networking as a medium to help government act more like the public it serves. Examples can be found at almost every state government portal through [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[YouTube]] widgets.

Government and its agents also have the opportunity to follow citizens to monitor satisfaction with services they receive. Through ListServs, RSS feeds, mobile messaging, micro-blogging services and blogs, government and its agencies can share information to citizens who share common interests and concerns. Government is also beginning to [[Twitter]]. In the state of [[Rhode Island]], Treasurer [[Frank T. Caprio]] is offering daily tweets of the state’s cash flow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/RITreasury/ RI Treasury (@RITreasury) op Twitter]. Twitter.com.

==Government 2.0==

Government 2.0 or Gov 2.0 refers to government policies that aim to harness collaborative technologies and interactive [[Internet]] tools to create an [[open source|open-source]] [[computing platform]] in which government, citizens, and innovative companies can improve transparency and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Reilly|first=Tim|title=Gov 2.0: It's All About The Platform|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/04/gov-20-its-all-about-the-platform/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply, Gov 2.0 is about "putting government in the hands of citizens".&lt;ref name=harper&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Logan|title=Gov 2.0 Rises to the Next Level: Open Data in Action|url=http://opensource.com/government/13/3/future-gov-20|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=Open Source|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gov 2.0 combines interactive [[Web 2.0]] fundamentals with e-government and increases citizen participation by using open-source platforms, which allow development of innovative [[Application software|apps]], websites, and [[Software widget|widgets]].

===Africa===

====Kenya====
Following the transition from the longstanding [[Kenya African National Union]] government to the [[National Rainbow Coalition – Kenya|National Rainbow Coalition]] government in December 2002, in January 2004 a Directorate of e-government was established after an executive (cabinet) session. The newly created department had the duty to draw the plan of action for future ICT implementations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-government.go.ke "Welcome to e-government"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606020549/http://www.e-government.go.ke/ |date=2013-06-06 }}, Kenya e-Government website, Directorate of e-Government Kenya, Retrieved 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other African nations, Kenya has embraced the high mobile penetration rate within its population. Even people living in remote areas that did not have access to traditional telecommunications' networks can now communicate with ease. The fact of the same has, and continues to have, a great impact on the governments' strategies in reaching out to its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mgovservice.ru/upload/uploadfiles/From%20eGov%20to%20mGov.pdf "From E-government to M-government: Facing the Inevitable"], Ibrahim Kushchu and M. Halid Kuscu, Mobile Government Lab (mGovLab), May 2004, Retrieved 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Given that about 70% of the population owns mobile phones, leading mobile network operators like Safaricom have taken a great step in offering services that meet citizens' demands. Such services include Kipokezi (which allows subscribers to do online chatting and also exchange electronic mails via standard mobile phones), and [[M-Pesa]] (which allows the subscribers to send and receive electronic cash). Such services have even appealed to the majority of Kenyans, as they support the branchless members of the society too, in undertaking normal and secure businesses via M-Pesa.  The recent [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] report reveals that MPESA transactions in Kenya exceeded those carried out by the Western Union worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/reo/2011/afr/eng/sreo1011.pdf "Regional Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa, Sustaining the Expansion"], World Economic and Financial Surveys, International Monetary Fund,  October 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-61635-125-0}}, Retrieved 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesia====
E-government in Indonesia is developing, especially in central and regional/local government offices. E-government was officially introduced to public administration by Presidential Directive No 6/2001 on Telematics, which states that the government of Indonesia has to use telematics technology to support good governance. Furthermore, e-government should have been introduced for different purposes in government offices. As one of ISO member countries, Indonesia gives more attention to facilitate the activities of standardization. Among of the facilities provided are building the National information system of standardization (SISTANAS) and Indonesia Standardization Information Network (INSTANET).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/07/27/challenges-e-government-implementation.html|title=Challenges in e-government implementation|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, ministries, institutions and local governments of Indonesia used to run separate e-government systems, which is now integrated into a central based system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://govinsider.asia/innovation/indonesia-integrated-e-government-system/|title=Indonesia to launch integrated e-government system|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the government has also undertaken programs for digitization of SMEs and the informal sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/asean-business/can-indonesia-be-a-powerhouse-in-the-digital-economy|title=Can Indonesia be a powerhouse in the digital economy?|newspaper=The Business Times|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the cities across Indonesia including [[Jakarta]], [[Bandung]], [[Surabaya]],and [[Makassar]] are implementing the concept of [[Smart City]], consisting of e-government, e-health, e-education, e-logistics and e-procurement as priority areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2018/07/13/smart-cities-digital-savviness-to-resilient-living.html|title=Smart cities: Digital savviness to resilient living|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====
In 2002, Iran published a detailed report named TAKFA (Barnameye Tose-e va Karborde Fanavaie Etela’at) in which it was predicted that most of the government bodies would try to virtualize their services as soon as possible. However, based on the reports by UN bodies, Iran has failed in the recent years to meet the average standards of e-government. In 2008, the Supreme Council of Information released a report which criticized the government for its poor advancement in employing new communication technologies for administration purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shahghasemi | first1 = E. | last2 = Tafazzoli | first2 = B. | last3 = Akhavan | first3 = M. | last4 = Mirani | first4 = G. | last5 = Khairkhah | first5 = T. | year = 2013 | title = Electronic Government in Iran: A Case Study | url = | journal = Online Journal of Social Sciences Research | volume = 2 | issue = 9| pages = 254–262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Iran launched the National Information Network and improved the quality and speed of internet access. In 2017 Iran introduced phase one of e-government including E-Tax, E-Customs, E-Visa,&lt;ref name="E-Gov Improving In Iran"&gt;{{cite news|title=e-Government in Iran Improving Gradually|url=https://financialtribune.com/articles/economy-sci-tech/56932/e-government-in-iran-improving-gradually|agency=Financial Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-Government Portal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iran.gov.ir|title=درگاه ملی خدمات دولت هوشمند - صفحه اصلی|website=iran.gov.ir|language=fa|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a mobile application to modernize Iran's government services.&lt;ref name="Egovir"&gt;{{cite web|title=Iranian E-Gov Website|url=http://iran.gov.ir/|website=iran.gov.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malaysia====
In Malaysia, the e-government efforts are undertaken by the Malaysian government, under the umbrella of Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) and e-government flagships, which was launched in mid-1996, by Dr Mahathir Mohamad (1981-2003), by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia (Jeong &amp; Nor Fadzlina, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mscmalaysia.my/ |title=mscmalaysia.my |publisher=mscmalaysia.my |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi.

====Yangon====
The [[Yangon City Development Committee]] (Burmese- ရန်ကုန်မြို့တော်စည်ပင်သာယာရေးကော်မတီ) (YCDC) is the administrative body of [[Yangon]], and Yangon is the largest city and former capital of [[Myanmar (Burma)]]. The [[Yangon City Development Committee]] consists of 20 departments. Its headquarters was on the [[Yangon City Hall]]. The committee's chairman is also the city's mayor.{{citation needed |date=August 2014}}

In 2003, YCDC was organized to provide e-Government for Yangon City. The main purposes of the city's e-Government program are to provide easy access between the government and the city's citizens via the Internet, to reduce paper usage, to reduce the city budget, to build the city's fiber ring, to provide timely public information, to store public data and to develop and expand G2G, G2C, G2B, and G2E programs.{{citation needed |date=August 2014}}

In January 2013 responsibility for e-Government was divided between the e-Government Administration Committee and the e-Government Processing Committee. The e-Government Administration Committee includes the Mayor of Yangon City as Chief, the General Secretary of Yangon City as Sub-Chief, and the other 20 head of department officers as chairmen. The e-Government Processing Committee includes the Head of Public Relation and Information Department as Chief and the other 20 deputy head of department officers as chairmen.{{citation needed |date=August 2014}}

====Pakistan====
{{Main|E-Government in Pakistan}}

In 2014, the [[Government of Pakistan]] created the National Information Technology Board (NITB) under the Ministry of Information Technology &amp; Telecom to enable a digital eco-system for Government services to the citizens of [[Pakistan]]. NITB was formed as a result of a merger between Pakistan Computer Bureau (PCB) and Electronic Government Directorate (EGD). 
&lt;br /&gt;
The key functions identified by the NITB are:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040331032631/http://www.e-government.gov.pk/ e-Government Pakistan]. E-government.gov.pk. Retrieved on 2012-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Provide technical guidance for the introduction of e-Governance in the Federal Govt. 
* Suggest efficient and cost-effective implementation of e-government programs in the Federal Ministries/Divisions. 
* To carry out training need assessment and design and implement the identified IT capacity building programs for the employees of Federal Ministries/Divisions.
* Review the status of e-government readiness on a regular basis to ensure sustainable, accelerated digitization and relevant human resource development.
* Identify the areas where IT interventions can be helpful and to suggest measures for the automation of these areas through Business Process Re-engineering (BPR).
NITB rolled out an e-Office Suite across various ministries in the [[Government of Pakistan]]. While it clearly pursued efficiency gains and improved transparency, it also hoped to deliver "efficient and cost-effective public services to citizens of Pakistan." The suite primarily included five modules or applications across all the ministries. Description of each module listed are: 
* Internal Communication Module
* HR Management Module
* Inventory &amp; Procurement Management Module
* Project Management Module
* Finance Budget Module
NITB released a high-level diagram that describes the process of transforming Federal Government agencies and ministries to e-Office environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.e-government.gov.pk/frmdetailse190.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003173827/http://www.e-government.gov.pk/frmdetailse190.html |archive-date=2016-10-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism: NITB's roll out of the e-Office suite across almost all federal agencies is not only overly ambitious but also likely to fail. It seems to put together a lot of lofty organizational efficiency goals with a set of delivery or citizen-facing targets. In fact, most of the services NITB has provided have been largely conceptual and not sufficient concrete. The process outlines in the adoption process diagram seems devoid of any user-centric design or value proposition formulation. Instead of creating lots of MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and taking advantage of an iterative and validated learning the process, the e-Office Suite seems to incorporate all the features and functions that various ministries and divisions may need or use. It seems to focus more on the needs of the bureaucrats and government agencies rather than the needs of the end user (citizens of Pakistan) and what services would they need that a ministry or division can provide.

==== Azerbaijan ====
The “E-Government” framework was established in accordance with the “National Strategy on Information-Communication Technologies in the Development of the Republic of [[Azerbaijan]] (2003-2012)” and implemented in the framework of the “E-Azerbaijan” Program. The project is aimed to increase the convenience and efficiency of the activity of state agencies, simplify interactions between population, businesses and government agencies, contribute to creating new citizen-official relations framework and ensure transparency and free flow of information.&lt;ref name="E-government"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mincom.gov.az/activity/information-technologies/e-government/|title=E-government|website=Ministry of Communications and High Technologies|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main components of the e-government infrastructure are integrated network infrastructure for state bodies, E-government portal, E-government gateway, State register of information resources and systems, e-signature, e-document circulation and e-government data center (under preparation).&lt;ref name="E-government"/&gt;

State portal www.e-gov.az was established to facilitate citizens in benefiting from e-services provided by government agencies on a ‘single window’ principle with the combination of services. Through e-government portal citizens can use more than 140 e-services of 27 state agencies. In addition, a gateway between government agencies was established in order to ensure mutual exchange of information, and most of state agencies are connected to this infrastructure. The gateway allows users to efficiently use the existing government information systems and a safe contact between them, issuing requests and rendering e-services, liberates citizens from providing same information or documents which are already available in information databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-gov.az/en|title=E-Government Portal|website=e-gov.az|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kazakhstan====
The e-government portal [http://egov.kz egov.kz] was launched in 2012 as part of Kazakhstan's effort to modernize how citizens access government services and information.&lt;ref name="egovkz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Egov.kz|url=http://egov.kz/cms/en|website=Egov.kz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The egov.kz mobile app was recognized as best app in the GovTechioneers competition at the 2017 World Government Summit in Dubai.&lt;ref name="appWGS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kazakh government services app receives award at World Government Summit|url=https://astanatimes.com/2017/02/kazakh-government-services-app-receives-award-at-world-government-summit/|agency=The Astana Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====

The main target on creating of e-government lies in the field of providing the equal opportunities for all the Russians in spite of their living place and their incomes and make more effective system of public administration. So e-government are created for reaching the useful system of public management accommodating the individual interests of every citizen by participation through ICTs in public policy-making.{{citation needed |date=July 2014}}

Nowadays Russian e-government includes such systems as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://base.garant.ru/12186739/ Government`s Regulation of the Russian Federation on June 8, 2011, № 451 "On infrastructure, provides information-technology interaction of information systems used for electronic government and municipal services"].&lt;/ref&gt;

1. The United interagency Interacting system using for providing of state and municipal services, exchange of information and data between participants of interagency interacting, quick approval of state and municipal decisions, etc.

2. The United system for authentication and authorization providing evidence of the rights of all participants of e-government.

3. United portal of state and municipal services and functions which are the "single window" for all information and services assured by government and municipals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gosuslugi.ru/ Gosuslugi.ru e-Government – Russia].&lt;/ref&gt;

The portal of public services is one of the key elements of the project to create "electronic government" in the country. The portal provides a single point of access to all references on state and municipal services through the Internet and provides citizens and organizations the opportunity to receive these services electronically. Monthly visits by users of the public services portal range between 200,000 and 700,000. For example, citizens are now able to get or exchange a driver license through this portal.

4. Head system providing utilization of electronic signature.

Other systems located on cloud services.

Today Russian e-government elements are demanded in the spheres of e-governance, e-services (e-health, e-education, e-library, etc.), e-commerce, e-democracy (web-election, Russian public initiative).
By the United Nations E-Government Survey 2012: E-Government for the People Russia became one of the 7 emerging leaders in e-government development, took 9th place in rating of e-government development in largest population countries, took 8th rank in Top e-participation leaders, after Norway, Sweden and Chile, Advancing 32 positions in the world rankings, the Russian Federation became the leader of e-government in Eastern Europe.

====Ukraine====
The main coordinating government body in matters of e-government is [[:uk:Державне агентство з питань електронного урядування | State e-Government Agency]], which was established on June 4, 2014. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.e.gov.ua/ua&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the state policy of the development of the information society was the adoption in 1998-2006 of the Laws of Ukraine "On electronic documents and electronic document circulation", "On the national program of informatization", "On the electronic digital signature" and a number of state acts related to informatization. Later, the Law of Ukraine “On the Basic Principles of the Information Society in Ukraine for 2007-2015”, “On Information Protection in Information and Telecommunication Systems” and a number of other legislative acts aimed at concretization and specification of these laws were adopted. This law emphasized the use of information and telecommunication technologies to improve public administration, relations between the state and citizens. The next stage of e-government development began in 2015 after the adoption of the Agreement of parliamentary factions of the [[Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine]] (in 2014) and the adoption of the Development Strategy "Ukraine - 2020", which was approved by Decree of the President of Ukraine dated January 12, 2015 (No. 5/2015).

In 2018, Ukraine ranks 82nd in the UN e-government ranking. &lt;ref&gt;https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/Portals/egovkb/Documents/un/2018-Survey/E-Government%20Survey%202018_FINAL%20for%20web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
{{Main|Open data in Canada}}

The current [[Clerk of the Privy Council (Canada)|Clerk of the Privy Council]] – the head of the federal public service has made workplace renewal a pillar of overall public service renewal. The key to workplace renewal is the adoption of collaborative networked tools. An example of such a tool is [[GCPEDIA]] – a wiki platform for federal public servants. Other tools include GCconnex, a social networking tool, and GCforums, a discussion board system.

====United States====

On January 21, 2009, the President signed one of his first memorandums – the Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies on Transparency and Open Government.&lt;ref name="Transparency and Open Government"&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Transparency_and_Open_Government/ Transparency and Open Government]. Whitehouse.gov. Retrieved on 2012-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The memo called for an unprecedented level of openness in Government, asking agencies to "ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration."&lt;ref name="Transparency and Open Government"/&gt; The memo further "directs the [[Chief Technology Officer]], in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Administrator of General Services (GSA), to coordinate the development by appropriate executive departments and agencies [and] to take specific actions implementing the principles set forth in the memorandum."&lt;ref name="Transparency and Open Government"/&gt;

President Obama’s memorandum centered around the idea of increasing [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] throughout various different federal departments and agencies. By enabling public websites like recovery.gov and data.gov to distribute more information to the American population, the administration believes that it will gain greater citizen participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2009-04-27/news/27644253_1_online-town-hall-barack-obama-obama-administration | title = Obama's e-government off to good start | accessdate = 2010-05-07 | date = 2009-04-27 | work = Economictimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the U.S. federal government launched [[Data.gov]] in order to make more government data available to the public. With data from Data.Gov, the public can build [[Applications software|apps]], websites, and [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]]. Although "Gov 2.0", as a concept and as a term, had been in existence since the mid-2000s, it was the launch of Data.gov that made it "go [[Viral phenomenon|viral]]".&lt;ref name=harper /&gt;

In August 2009 the [[City of San Francisco]] launched [https://data.sfgov.org DataSF.org] with more than a hundred datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newsom|first=Gavin|title=San Francisco Opens The City’s Data|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/19/san-francisco-opens-the-city’s-data/|newspaper=TechCrunch|date=19 August 2009|authorlink=Gavin Newsom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just weeks after the DataSF.org launch, new apps and websites were developed. Using data feeds available on DataSF.org, civic-minded developers built programs to display public transportation arrival and departure times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Routesy Bay Area|url=http://www.routesy.com/|publisher=Routesy|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where to recycle hazardous materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newsom|first=Gavin|title=Recycling in San Francisco Made Easy with the iPhone |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2009/06/15/recycling-in-san-francisco-made-easy-with-the-iphone/|newspaper=Clean Technica|date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and crime patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Francisco Crimespotting|url=http://sanfrancisco.crimespotting.org/|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the launch of DataSF.org there have been more than seventy apps created with San Francisco's data.

In March 2009, former [[San Francisco Mayor]] [[Gavin Newsom]] was at [[Twitter]] headquarters for a conversation about technology in government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSE20sVyyeo "A Conversation with Twitter about the Future of Technology in Government"] (video), Gavin Newsom and Evan Williams, Mayor's Press Conference (YouTube), 10 March 2009, 47 minutes.&lt;/ref&gt; During the town hall, Newsom received a tweet about a [[pothole]].&lt;ref name=mitch&gt;{{cite news|last=Wagner|first=Mitch|title=San Francisco Twitters With Citizens To Fix City|url=http://www.informationweek.com/internet/social-network/san-francisco-twitters-with-citizens-to/217702151|newspaper=InformationWeek|date=8 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He turned to Twitter co-founders [[Biz Stone]] and [[Evan Williams (Internet entrepreneur)|Evan Williams]] and said let's find a way for people to tweet their service requests directly to San Francisco's 311 customer service center. Three months later, San Francisco launched the first Twitter 311 service, called @SF311, allowing residents to tweet, text, and send photos of potholes and other requests directly to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Van Grove|first=Jennifer|title=San Francisco First City to Instate City-Wide 311 Twitter Program|url=http://mashable.com/2009/06/02/san-francisco-311-twitter/|newspaper=Mashable|date=2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with Twitter and using the open-source platform, CoTweet turned @SF311 into reality. The software procurement process for something like this would normally have taken months, but in this case, it took less than three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fretwell|first=Luke|title=SF Mayor Newsom: Open Source More Reliable|url=http://govfresh.com/2010/07/2010/01/sf-mayor-newsom-open-source-more-reliable/|newspaper=GovFresh|date=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The @SF311 is saving the city money in [[call center]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maeder|first=Kate|title=#OpenData and Real-Time Information Saves San Francisco Over $1 Million|url=http://www.resetsanfrancisco.org/news/jun-25-12/open-data-real-time-information-saves-gov-money|newspaper=Reset San Francisco|date=25 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809201145/http://www.resetsanfrancisco.org/news/jun-25-12/open-data-real-time-information-saves-gov-money|archivedate=9 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EasyWay''' was an international [[tea]] outlet that serves hot and cold beverages with assorted flavouring. It started out as a small store in [[Taiwan]] owned by Kuo Wun-Ho and Fu Hsin-Chin back in 1992, its success riding on the popularity of [[bubble tea]] in Taiwan. EasyWay was a company with more than 700 stores worldwide, including outlets in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. 

EasyWay serves tea and other drinks in sealed cups with heat-sealed plastic lids. Consumers can customise their order with such toppings as [[tapioca]] pearls or flavoured jelly. The tea offered includes [[green tea]] and [[black tea]], with an option of adding powdered mixtures such as milk, cocoa and almonds, or flavoured syrups such as green apple, lemon and pineapple. Outlets also serve other items such as shaved ice drinks, relish tea, flavoured milk teas and iced chocolate and coffee.

The '''Edinburgh BioQuarter''' is a [[bioscience]] community based near the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]] and the [[Queen's Medical Research Centre]] in [[Edinburgh]], close to the [[Roslin Institute for Animal Biology]]. It is Scotland's key initiative in the development of its [[life sciences]] industry, which employs more than 30,000 people in 600 companies.&lt;ref name=Entente-Health&gt;{{cite web|title=Edinburgh BioQuarter, the University of Edinburgh|url=http://entente-health.eu/Networking_Area/Organisations/TTO/Edinburgh-BioQuarter-The-University-Of-Edinburgh.kl#.VatRnfmqpBc|publisher=Entente-Health|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2007, [[Scottish Enterprise]] completed a series of land deals which cleared a 55-acre site for development adjacent to the existing Royal Infimary of Edinburgh and the creation of the BioQuarter was announced. In early 2010, Dr [[Mike Capaldi (doctor)|Mike Capaldi]] joined BioQuarter as Commercialisation Director and the development of an executive team and business creation programme were launched.

The key partners in the Edinburgh BioQuarter initiative are [[Scottish Enterprise]]/[[Scottish Development International]], the [[University of Edinburgh]] and [[NHS Lothian]].

From 2011, it will be joined at this location by the [[Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine]], giving the BioQuarter one of the highest concentrations of research classed officially by the government as "internationally leading" (four-star, according to the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise).

==Facilities and Companies==
[[File:Centre for Regenerative Medicine.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's impression of the Centre for Regenerative Medicine]]
Edinburgh BioQuarter currently co-locates a 1000+-bed [[teaching hospital]], the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]], with the Queen’s Medical Research Institute (ranked #1 in the UK for [[Clinical research|clinical medical research]], according to the 2008 research assessment exercise) and the [[Clinical Research Imaging Centre]], or CRIC, opened by [[Prince Phillip|HM the Duke of Edinburgh]] in late 2010.&lt;ref name=UKSPA&gt;{{cite web|title=Edinburgh BioQuarter|url=http://www.ukspa.org.uk/members/ebq|publisher=UKSPA|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last three years, Edinburgh has attracted 53% of all [[Wellcome Trust]] grants in Scotland and 62% of [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) funding in Scotland, making it a major centre of research income.

In November 2011, a new [[bioincubator]] building will come on stream offering {{convert|80000|sqft|m2}} of office and laboratory space, as well as the new Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine (SCRM), headed by Professor Sir [[Ian Wilmut]], creator of "[[Dolly the Sheep]]." This new centre will apply Scotland’s world-leading [[stem cell research]] to new therapies for conditions such as [[Parkinson's disease]],{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[multiple sclerosis]] and other conditions.

In September &lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;{{cite web|title=Edinburgh BioQuarter gains three new tenants|url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/management/edinburgh-bioquarter-gains-three-new-tenants-1-2776226|publisher=Scotsman|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2010, author [[JK Rowling]] endowed research at the BioQuarter with a £10 million gift to create the [[Anne Rowling Centre for Multiple Sclerosis]].

By 2016, the new [[Royal Hospital for Children and Young People]]&lt;ref name="Scottish Entreprise"&gt;{{cite web|title=Opportunities at Edinburgh BioQuarter|url=http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/services/develop-new-products-and-services/bioquarter-commercialisation/overview|publisher=Scottish Entreprise|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; will be located at the BioQuarter, together with the [[Scottish Mind and Body Institute]], a cross-disciplinary centre aimed at finding cures or therapies for [[Neurology|neurological conditions]].

==Companies based at Edinburgh BioQuarter==

Part of BioQuarter’s purpose is to create new companies based on [[medical research]] being undertaken in the [[National Health Service|NHS]] and at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. For this purpose it has created an innovation competition, offering prizes worth £45,000 to researchers in all disciplines at the University of Edinburgh and [[NHS Lothian]]. The first round of these prizes will be awarded in March 2011.

Companies currently located at or associated with the BioQuarter community include:&lt;ref name=UKSPA /&gt;

*[[Fios Genomics]] – genomic and bioinformatics data analysis services for [[drug discovery]] &amp; development
*[[Immunosolv]] – technologies and products for the removal of dead cells
*[[TPP Global Development]] - a drug development company with offices in London and Edinburgh
*[[I2Eye Ltd]] – [[visual field impairment]] testing for small children and [[special needs]] groups
*[[NeuroORG]] – [[management consultancy]] that shapes organisational behaviour on the basis of [[neurological science]]

Further companies are expected to join the BioQuarter community over the next twelve months as the process of company formation gathers pace. In addition, licensing deals and other partnerships with major international pharmaceutical companies and equipment manufacturers will add to the number of organisations housed at the BioQuarter.

The '''feminine style of management''' is a [[management style]] generally characterized by more feminine quality [[soft skills]] and behaviors such as empathy, effective communication, and a generally more democratic or team-styled work environment. The style is a growing trend within businesses and is characterized by a form of [[transformational leadership]] style. The feminine style of management, although characterized by traits commonly labeled as [[feminine]], it is not a style of management that is only used by females; it is also a style which has been found beneficial for particular types of businesses and organizations.

==Historical development==

===Early 1900s===
Beginning with textile mills and the shoe-making industry of post-revolutionary America, the first real appearance of an explosion of women in a general workforce, whether at home or manufacturing, came at the turn of the century. By [[World War I]], many women were poised to join the workforce as a high population of men served in the war. As men returned from the war and a falling economy led to the [[Great Depression]], women suffered displacement. By [[World War II]] there was a similar growth of women in business that had been previously reserved for men. The combination of a better economy and a quickly changing standard of society norms, many women's roles and functions in business steadily increased following World II.

===1970s–1980s===
In the 1970s feminist authors denied or minimized the differences between men and women to establish that women had similar talents to men and should have equal labor opportunities. In [[Schutlz v. Wheaton Glass Co]]., a U.S. Court of Appeals ruled jobs held by men must be "substantially equal" but not "identical" to fall under the protection of the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]] and that it is therefefore illegal for employers to change the job titles of women workers in order to pay them less than men.

However, as the 1980s began, differences were more emphasized and noted as a means of progression due the management style differences that came of feminine values and ways of behaving, feeling, and thinking.&lt;ref name="Management Style-British Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wajcman|first=Judy|title=Desperately Seeking Differences: Is management style gendered?|journal=British Journal of Industrial Relations|date=September 1996|volume=34|pages=333–349|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8543.1996.tb00478.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2011-10-15--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990–present===
In 1991, women represented 45% of all managerial positions.&lt;ref name="Business Encylopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Business|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/encyclopedia/Val-Z/Women-in-Business.html|work=Encyclopedia of Business|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, although the feminine management style can be found being utilized throughout organizations internationally now, barriers to acceptance of this management style include stereotype and perceptions, mentoring and networking availability, [[workplace discrimination]], family related issues, as well as funding availability.&lt;ref name="Organizational Textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Modaff|first=D.P|title=Organizational Communication: Foundations, challenges, and misunderstandings|year=2012|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|isbn=978-0-205-79825-4|pages=255–273|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rise in female leaders is a result of changing theories and practices of [[leadership]].

==Gendered organizations==
Reasons a systematic [[theory]] of gender and organizations is necessary:&lt;ref name="Gendered organizations Acker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acker|first=Joan|title=Hierarchies, Jobs, Bodies: A Theory of Gendered Organizations|journal=Gender and Society|date=June 1990|volume=4|pages=139–158|doi=10.1177/089124390004002002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The gender segregation of work, including divisions between paid and unpaid work, is partly created through organizational practices.
# Related to gender segregation, income and status inequality between women and men is also partly created in organizational processes; understanding these processes is necessary for understanding gender inequality.
# Organizations are one arena in which widely disseminated cultural images of gender are invented and reproduced. Knowledge of cultural productions is important for understanding gender construction.
# Some aspects of individual gender identity, perhaps particularly masculinity, are also products of organizational processes and pressures.
# An important feminist project is to make large-scale organizations more democratic and more supportive of humane goals.

===Gendering interaction processes===
In addition to the reasons that it is necessary to examine feminine styles of management within theories of gendered organizations, Acker adds, is because gendering occurs in at least five different interacting processes.&lt;ref name="Gendered organizations Acker" /&gt;

* First, the construction of divisions along lines of gender-[[division of labor]], of allowed behaviors, of locations in physical space, of power, including the institutionalized means of maintaining the divisions in the structures of labor markets, the family, the state.
* Second, the construction of [[symbols]] and images that explain, express, reinforce, or sometimes oppose those divisions.
* Third, interactions between women and men, women and women, men and men, including all those patterns that enact dominance and submission.
* Fourth, processes help to produce gendered components of individual [[Identity (social science)|identity]], which may include consciousness of the existence of the other three aspects of gender, such as, in organizations, choice of appropriate work, language use, clothing, and presentation of self as a gendered member of an organization.
* Finally, [[gender]] is implicated in the fundamental, ongoing processes of creating and conceptualizing social structures.

==Characteristics==

===Types of management===
Within the three main types of managerial styles, studies have examined differences in [[masculine]] and [[feminine]] styles. The first is the [[task management]] style, or how much a leader initiates, organizes, and/or defines work activities and processes. The second style,an [[interpersonal]] based style, which is a style where generally the leader builds morale, relationships, satisfaction, and commitment in the organization. Lastly, the third is the [[group decision making]] style, which is when the leader encourages a participative, democratic approach&lt;ref name="Business Encyclopedia" /&gt;

===Feminine style characteristics===
Some studies find differences between males' and females' task accomplishment styles and interpersonal styles. Males tended to be more task-oriented; females tended to be more relationship-oriented. These differences, however, have been observed only in men and women subjects of laboratory experiments, that is, people asked to speculate how they would behave if they were leaders. Management traditionally been male dominated and constructed in masculine terms. Present ideas involving femininity in management include transforming places of work into relation-oriented, flexible, and humane institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Due Billing|first=Yvonne|author2=Mats Alvesson| author-link= Mats Alvesson |title=Questioning the Notion of Feminine Leadership: A Critical Perspective on the Gender Labeling of Leadership|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|date=July 2000|volume=7|issue=3|pages=144–157|doi=10.1111/1468-0432.00103}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences disappear in studies where actual managers are compared: most conclude that women do not behave differently from men in the same or similar kind of leadership position. Moreover, experienced women managers show no differences in leadership abilities from experienced male managers. These women, in fact, are likely to more closely resemble their male counterparts in drive, skills, temperament, and competitiveness, than the average woman in the population.&lt;ref name="Business Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender and Leadership|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/encyclopedia/For-Gol/Gender-and-Leadership.html|work=Reference for Business Encyclopedia|accessdate=10/02/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Cummings stated, ""The notion of what makes an effective leader is changing, and you will find both [traditionally defined] ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’ components." &lt;ref name="knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu"&gt;http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-masculine-and-feminine-sides-of-leadership-and-culture-perception-vs-reality/&lt;/ref&gt; In order for women to make an impact within an organization as an executive they need to be aware of their leadership styles and strengths.&lt;ref name="knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu"/&gt;

==Examples==

===Examples in research===
In 1990, Alice Eagly and Johnson conducted a study on gender and leadership and found results they later emphasized with supporting meta-analysis data.&lt;ref name="Eagly 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=A|author2=Johnson, B.T.|title=Gender and leadership style: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1990|volume=108|pages=233–256|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.108.2.233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in 1992 and 1995, researchers Eagly and Johnson also conducted meta-analysis on the effectiveness and evaluation, respectively, of differing management styles. The results showed that the main difference in management styles in men and women were that women are more democratic, while men were found to generally be more autocratic, however, the studies show little evidence that would suggest males and females differ in their leadership effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Eagly 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=A |author2=Makhijani, M.G. |author3=Klonsky, B.G.|title=Gender and the effectiveness of leaders: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1992|volume=111|pages=3–22|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eagly 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=A|author2=Karau, S. J.|author3=Makhijani, M. G.|title=Gender and the effectiveness of leaders: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1995|volume=117|pages=125–145|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.1.125|pmid=7870858}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that women tend to be more focused on encouraging participation and involving their workforce in business decisions while men are more focused on encouraging performance and driving towards tangible production.

In 2003, a meta-analysis was conducted by Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, and Van Engen that compared male and female managers on measures of transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership styles; their findings emphasized the results of their previous study.The meta-analysis study showed that women were slightly more likely than men to exercise a transformational leadership style.&lt;ref name="Eagly, Johannesen, &amp; Van Engen 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=A |author2=Johannesen-Schmidt, M.C. |author3=Van Engen, M.|title=Transformational, transactional, and laissezfaire leadership styles: A meta-analysis comparing women and men.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2003|volume=108|pages=569–591|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.4.569 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a style of management that is likely to be used by coaches, teachers, and other individuals focused on developing subordinates. The transformational leadership encourages participation and creative problem solving. Eagly proposes that the transformational style of management is likely more advantageous for women to employ however. Men were shown to be more likely to critique their employees and be less interactive, in contrast to the women who utilized a more "hands-on" approach.

In contrast, research in the past few decades shows that these results are only averages. Men and Women do not show a significant difference in these management styles, only slight differences. Some men proved to use more feminine styles, while some women proved to use more masculine styles. Eagly states that,"the sex differences are small because the leader role itself carries a lot of weight in determining people's behavior.""

In 2005, a year-long study conducted by Caliper, a Princeton, New Jersey-based management consulting firm, and Aurora, a London-based organization that advances women, identified a number of characteristics that distinguish women leaders from men when it comes to qualities of leadership: Women leaders are more assertive and persuasive, have a stronger need to get things done and are more willing to take risks than male leaders....Women leaders were also found to be more empathetic and flexible, as well as stronger in interpersonal skills than their male counterparts....enabling them to read situations accurately and take information in from all sides....These women leaders are able to bring others around to their point of view....because they genuinely understand and care about where others are coming from....so that the people they are leading feel more understood, supported and valued.  These findings were summarized into four specific statements about women's leadership qualities: (1) Women leaders are more persuasive than their male counterparts, (2) When feeling the sting of rejection, women leaders learn from adversity and carry on with an "I'll show you" attitude, (3) Women leaders demonstrate an inclusive, team-building leadership style of problem solving and decision making, (4) Women leaders are more likely to ignore rules and take risks.&lt;ref name="Lowen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowen|first=Linda|title=Qualities of Women Leaders: The Unique Leadership Characteristics of Women|url=http://womensissues.about.com/od/intheworkplace/a/WomenLeaders.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=4/8/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BET's CEO, Debra Lee, explains that it is easy to generalize the differences in gender leadership styles as "women do it this way, and men do it that way."  Instead of simply generalizing, Debra Lee asserts that it is important to discuss these differences so that women don't feel uncomfortable managing differently from men.  During this interview she further states that we should encourage young women to climb the corporate ladder.  Lee explained that her hardest lesson was learning to follow her gut when others challenged it, but that lesson has truly paid off.  She insists that we encourage young women to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cunningham|first=Lillian|title=On women and Washington: A leadership interview with BET's Debra Lee|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/on-women-and-washington-a-leadership-interview-with-bets-debra-lee/2012/03/20/gIQAoo5GSS_story.html|accessdate=4/8/12|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=3/21/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's vital for women to embrace these differences. During a 2006 speech given by Dr. Musimbi Kanyoro, the World YWCA Secretary General, she explained that the attitudes toward leadership are changing and what women offer is essential.  She stated: "Domination as a leadership style is becoming less and less popular. There is a new growing appreciation of....those traits that women use to keep families together and to organize volunteers to unite and make change in the shared life of communities. These newly admired leadership qualities of shared leadership; nurturance and doing good for others are today not only sought after but also indeed needed to make a difference in the world....A feminine way of leading includes helping the world to understand and be principled about values that really matter."&lt;ref name="Lowen"/&gt;

===Recent examples in global society===
The feminine style of management embodying organizational progression, more and more female leaders are found within society today. In addition to the thousands of women who now receive graduate and doctoral degrees, many hold managerial positions within companies, and females hold 45% of all managerial posts.&lt;ref name="Sharpe Businessweek"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sharpe |first=Rochelle |title=As Leaders, Women Rule |url=http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_47/b3708145.htm |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=20 November 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128040043/http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_47/b3708145.htm |archivedate=2011-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, many nonprofit organizations take a feminine style of leadership approach when handling employees.  These particular organizations tend to encourage participation among group members, show flexibility, and maintain a non-hierarchical work environment.&lt;ref&gt;Questioning the notion of feminine leadership: a critical perspective on the gender labeling of leadership, Yvonne Due Billing &amp; Mats Alvesson, Gender, Work and Organization, 7(3), 2000, pp 144-157&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders that take on this style tend to show genuine care and understanding towards their employees. The empathy they have for others enables their employees to feel as though they are recognized and valued within the organization. These leaders are also known for their communication skills and tendency to listen to multiple perspective before making decisions.&lt;ref&gt;"Women Leaders Study: The Qualities That Distinguish Women Leaders." Caliperonline.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Their desire to use team-building activities creates a sense of community within organizations, which in turn helps to meet overall goals.&lt;ref&gt;Kanyoro, Musimbi. "Challenges to Women's Leadership." Speech in honor of YWCA of Salt Lake centennial celebration. 13 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a company using team-building, genuinely understand its employees needs, and embracing femininity is Mary Kay Cosmetics. This company strives to treat employees as individuals and help them reach their personal goals. When employees meet particular sales goals they are rewarded with things they desire, such as pink Cadillacs and diamonds. These actions show employees that they are valued and understood, which leads to a positive corporate culture.&lt;ref&gt;Knowledge@Wharton (2005). [http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1287 "The 'Masculine' and 'Feminine' Sides of Leadership and Culture: Perception vs. Reality."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sung-Joo Kim, chairman and chief executive of luxury-goods company MCM Worldwide, is an example of a woman using the feminine style of management to help successfully run a company.Kim's sensitivity and openness towards employees gives her an advantage over other luxury-good corporations. Kim has to find a balance between her sensitivity and still maintaining order and a level of toughness. Kim grew up in a patriarchal Korean household and her experiences led her to strive to prove to others that femininity and power are not mutually exclusive and it is quite possible to be a nurturing woman and still run a successful business.&lt;ref&gt;Covel, Simona. (2008). [https://blogs.wsj.com/independentstreet/2008/06/09/the-benefits-of-a-feminine-leadership-style/ "The Benefits of a 'Feminine' Leadership Style."]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Esther Wachs Book, "A new breed of leader is emerging, and that breed is female."  She contends that women, such as Meg Whitman of eBay and Marcy Carsey of Carsey-Werner, succeed because they embody seven uniquely female abilities: they can sell their visions; they are not afraid to reinvent the rules; they are focused on achievement; they show courage under fire; they turn challenges into opportunities; they are aware of customer preferences; and they maximize what Book calls "high touch" in an era of high tech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are women natural leaders, and men...the opposite?|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=265|publisher=Knowledge@Wharton|accessdate=4/8/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt''''' is a book by the American writer [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Michael-Lewis/4349 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |title=Michael Lewis author page |accessdate=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] on March 31, 2014. The book is a [[non-fiction]] investigation into the phenomenon of [[high-frequency trading]] (HFT) in the US equity market, with the author interviewing and collecting the experiences of several individuals working on Wall Street.”&lt;ref name=FT1&gt;{{cite news|last=Massoudi|first=Arash|title='Flash Boys' starts Wall St soul searching|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6f514f02-b684-11e3-b230-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2xUy8USU5|accessdate=March 31, 2014|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=March 28, 2014|author2=Tracy Alloway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis concludes that HFT is used as a method to [[front running|front run]] orders placed by investors. He goes further to suggest that broad technological changes and unethical trading practices have transformed the U.S. stock market from "the world's most public, most democratic, financial market" into a "rigged" market.&lt;ref name=60mins/&gt;

The book has drawn criticism from some academics and industry experts, particularly on Lewis's grasp of HFT and other factual inaccuracies in its depiction of trading.&lt;ref name=NoahS&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Noah|title=Book Review: Flash Boys|url=http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/book-review-flash-boys.html|accessdate=April 19, 2017|date=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleckner|first1=Andreas Martin|title=Section 4 and Footnote 56, Regulating Trading Practices, The Oxford Handbook of Financial Regulation|ssrn=2476950|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheEc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Buttonwood|first=|title=HFT: the backlash continues|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2014/05/markets|date=May 7, 2014|newspaper=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have praised Lewis's explanations of trading concepts and concurred with his criticism of HFT; however, it is suggested that he neglects to pay attention to the larger issue of financial regulation, and had excessively simplified the relationship between various institutions in the financial market.&lt;ref name=NoahS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite news|last=Salmon|first=Felix|title=The Lewis Effect|date=April 7, 2014|publisher=Slate Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Andrew|title=Flash Boys by Michael Lewis – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/16/flash-boys-michael-lewis-review|accessdate=June 26, 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few executives in the industry have also responded by dismissing the book's content as "closer to fiction".&lt;ref name=II&gt;{{cite news|last1=Narang|first1=Manoj|title=A Much-Needed HFT Primer for 'Flash Boys' Author Michael Lewis|url=http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/Article/3328158/Banking-and-Capital-Markets-Trading-and-Technology/A-Much-Needed-HFT-Primer-for-Flash-Boys-Author-Michael-Lewis.html#.U6ygpI1dWJg|accessdate=June 26, 2014|work=Institutional Investor|date=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book centers on several people, including [[Sergey Aleynikov]], a former programmer for [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[Brad Katsuyama|Bradley Katsuyama]], the founder of [[IEX]], the Investors' Exchange.&lt;ref name=FT1/&gt;&lt;ref name=60mins&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Lewis 60 Minutes Interview on HFT [VIDEO]|url=http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/03/michael-lewis-60-minutes/|work=Value Walk|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/ex-goldman-programmer-sentenced-to-8-years-for-theft-of-trading-code/?_r=0 |title=Former Goldman Programmer Gets 8-year Jail Term for Code Theft |date=March 18, 2011 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/michael-lewis-goldman-sachs-programmer |title=Michael Lewis: Did Goldman Sachs Overstep in Criminally Charging Its Ex-Programmer? |work=Vanity Fair |date=September 2013 |author=Michael Lewis |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Flash Boys'' starts out describing a $300 million project from [[Spread Networks]] - the construction of an {{convert|827|mi|adj=on}} cable that cuts straight through mountains and rivers from Chicago to New Jersey - with the sole goal of reducing the transmission time for data from 17 to 13 milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=High-frequency trading: when milliseconds mean millions |work=The Telegraph |date=April 2, 2014 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/10736960/High-frequency-trading-when-milliseconds-mean-millions.html |quote=In his new book Flash Boys, author Michael Lewis looks at the extraordinary lengths high-frequency traders go to&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; to beat the competition }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book takes a look at how [[electronic trading]] replaced the [[trading floor]] of screaming brokers, slamming telephones and hysteria-inducing ticker tape, and how that change impacted the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maslin|first1=Janet|title=Hobbling Wall Street Cowboys|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/books/flash-boys-by-michael-lewis-a-tale-of-high-speed-trading.html?_r=0|accessdate=June 26, 2014|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of data is a major theme in the book; the faster the data travels, the better the price of the trade. Lewis claims access to this fiber optic cable, as well as other technologies, presents an opportunity for the market to be controlled even more by the big Wall Street institutions. To counter this disadvantage to investors, Katsuyama bands together a team that sets out to develop a new exchange, called [[IEX]], to make the playing field for trading fairer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gapper|first1=John|title='Flash Boys' by Michael Lewis|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/2996a228-b9a4-11e3-957a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz35mqzT1ua|accessdate=June 26, 2014|work=21 March 2014|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A chapter goes into detail about [[Sergey Aleynikov]], the former [[Goldman Sachs]] programmer convicted of stealing the bank's high-frequency trading code and how Goldman actually called the [[FBI]] and then educated the FBI on that code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/01/us-goldman-sachs-aleynikov-verdict-idUSKBN0NM43V20150501 |title=Split verdict for Sergey Aleynikov ends a tumultuous trial but leaves open the chance the yearslong saga could continue |work=[[Reuters]] |date=May 1, 2015 |accessdate=June 18, 2018 |first=Tom |last=Brown }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jury-gives-split-verdict-in-trial-of-former-goldman-programmer-sergey-aleynikov-1430496291 |title=Ex-Goldman Programmer Guilty of Stealing Code: Split verdict for Sergey Aleynikov ends a tumultuous trial but leaves open the chance the years long saga could continue |date=May 1, 2015 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=June 18, 2018 |first=Christopher M. |last=Matthews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book concludes by observing that there is now a conventional (microwave) link between Chicago and New Jersey, which follows an even straighter route than the Spread Networks' 827-mile cable (as microwaves always follow a direct path, whereas cables, by their very nature, must, at least occasionally, detour around physical barriers). The new route also takes advantage of the faster speed of signal travel that is possible through air (compared to signal travel speed through glass fibers, which slows light down). With these two advantages, this new link shaved 4.5 milliseconds off the Spread Networks speed, thereby rendering it obsolete.

==Critical response==
Manoj Narang, CEO of [[high-frequency trading]] firm Tradeworx, argued that Lewis' book is more "fiction than fact," claiming Lewis needs a primer in HFT.&lt;ref name=II/&gt; A review by academic blogger Scott Locklin notes that Lewis had never spoken to, nor cited, a single high-frequency trader in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Locklin|first1=Scott|title=Michael Lewis: shilling for the buyside|url=http://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2014/04/04/michael-lewis-shilling-for-the-buyside/|accessdate=June 26, 2014|publisher=Scott Locklin|date=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Ross, writing in [[The Guardian]], praised the book as an "effective exposé" but criticizes the author for arguing for the "heroism" of one group of financial insiders over another.&lt;ref name=Ross/&gt; A month later, an article on [[The Economist]] noted that Lewis's book had generated "vigorous criticism", but that there may be some merits in its [[liquidity]] concerns.&lt;ref name="TheEc"/&gt;

A [[Financial Post]] reviewer suggested that Lewis intentionally omitted details that point to market-stabilizing benefits of HFT: "Ironically, the Flash Crash itself was just glossed over. Could that be because the primary cause of that momentary blip lay in a confluence of regulatory mistakes and that it was many of the demonized [[HFT trading|HFT]]s who actually stood fast throughout and thereby insured that the damage was a fraction of what it could have been had only the shell-shocked, traditional participants been left to respond?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bandeen|first1=Ian|title=Flash ... or Fiction? Hit book on high-frequency trading lets the real villains off the hook|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2014/05/29/flash-or-fiction-hit-book-on-high-frequency-trading-lets-the-real-villains-off-the-hook/|accessdate=June 26, 2014|work=Financial Post|date=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Oxford University Press handbook chapter authored by Andreas Fleckner calls ''Flash Boys'' a readable and mostly accurate introduction into such topics as [[dark pools]], [[front-running]], or [[kickbacks]]. The article however suggests that on-site trading practices are, nonetheless, too technical for laymen, market observers, or even regulators to fully understand. The author recommends providing incentives for [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]] rather than SEC regulation.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

Felix Salmon, a financial columnist for [[Slate Magazine]], asserted that the negative impact of high-frequency trading is restricted to "very rich" financial intermediaries, such as [[hedge fund]]s. He notes that Lewis's story "needs victims" and that he portrays several billionaire characters as victims "by pulling out every rhetorical device he can muster." &lt;ref name=Slate/&gt; In a crucial part of the book's narrative, a mutual fund manager named Rich Gates was "shocked" to find out he was paying 0.04% per trade due to his fund's dependence on a HFT front.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt; The reviewer noted that Gates' own mutual fund charged an average of 2.41% for "expenses" to retail investors.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;

==Impact and aftermath==

The book reached No. 1 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], overtaking [[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]], and remained on the top for three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2014-04-20/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html |title=Best Sellers, Hardcover Non-fiction |date=April 20, 2014 |publisher=''The New York Times'' |accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Weil at Bloomberg suggests that [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s investigation into high frequency trading, a day after the book's release, was directly motivated by the book's claims.&lt;ref name=Weil&gt;{{cite news|last=Weil|first=Jonathan|title=Weil on Finance: FBI Hops on Michael Lewis Bandwagon|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-04-01/weil-on-finance-fbi-hops-on-michael-lewis-bandwagon|accessdate=April 1, 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg News|date=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Huff&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradford|first=Harry|title=FBI Investigating High-Frequency Traders: WSJ|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/31/fbi-high-speed-trading_n_5065622.html|accessdate=April 1, 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis's phrase "The market is rigged" was often referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rubenstein|first=Ari|title=Thank you, Michael Lewis|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101628594|work=CNBC|accessdate=May 1, 2014|date=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairwoman of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), [[Mary Jo White]], stated in Congressional testimony on April 29, 2014, that U.S. financial markets "are not rigged" in response to a direct question on claims in Lewis's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bartash|first=Jeffry|title=U.S. markets 'not rigged,' SEC boss says, White downplays 'flash boy' charges in new Michael Lewis book|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-markets-not-rigged-sec-boss-says-2014-04-29|work=MarketWatch|publisher=Dow Jones|accessdate=May 1, 2014|date=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] disputed claims made in Lewis’ book on May 2, 2014, stating in a [[CNBC]] interview that "the system isn’t rigged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System isn’t ‘Rigged’-Bloomberg defends HFT|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101635189|work=CNBC|publisher=CNBC.com|accessdate=June 16, 2014|date=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Levitt]], adviser to high-frequency firm [[KCG Holdings]] and former SEC chairman, commented that variation exists within the group of high-speed traders that Lewis’ book describes, saying "What is missed in the book and in the general discussion of HFT is there are some HFT traders who respect the sanctity of the investor, and some who don’t."&lt;ref name=Mamudi&gt;{{cite news |last=Mamudi |first=Sam |date=April 1, 2014 |title=Not Every High-Frequency Trader Is Predatory, Levitt Says |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-01/not-every-high-frequency-trader-is-predatory-arthur-levitt-says.html |newspaper=Bloomberg News |accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2014, the New York Stock Exchange and two affiliated exchanges agreed to pay $4.5 million as a settlement for related investigations by the SEC.&lt;ref name=McGrath&gt;{{cite news|last=McGrath |first=Maggie|date = May 1, 2014|title=SEC Fines New York Stock Exchange $4.5 Million For Failure To Comply With Exchange Rules|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2014/05/01/sec-fines-new-york-stock-exchange-4-5-million-for-failure-to-comply-with-exchange-rules|newspaper=Forbes|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SEC noted a number of procedural violations, an improper use of an [[error account]], and operating a [[block trading platform]] that did not comply to NYSE/SEC rules. The NYSE also agreed to find an independent consultant to review its procedures and policies. This was the second-ever SEC financial penalty to be levied at a stock exchange; the first penalty was handed out in 2012.  Some writers suggest that the release of popular works such as Flash Boys contributed to these decisions. The charges are unrelated to high-frequency trading.&lt;ref name=McGrath/&gt;

[[File:GIST Logo.jpg|thumbnail]]
The '''Global Innovation through Science and Technology initiative''' ('''GIST''') is a U.S. government program on innovation and entrepreneurship. The program assists businesspeople to establish startups. GIST participants in 135 emerging economies can develop skills, build networks, find mentors, and access financing through a combination of in-country training, a pitch competition, interactive online programming, and direct connections to U.S. experts. GIST helps create conditions for successful local entrepreneurship ecosystems and enables global youth to develop local solutions to local problems.  GIST is also one of the key programs under President Obama's SPARK Initiative, an initiative under which programs are selected to represent the best work being done by the U.S. Government to advance entrepreneurship around the world.

Since 2011, GIST has engaged more than 2.8 million innovators and entrepreneurs worldwide and mentored over 5,000 startups that have generated more than $110 million in revenue. GIST is a partnership led by the [[U.S. Department of State]]'s [[Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs]], with implementation of programs by [[Venturewell]] and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS).

==Launch ==
The GIST programs were announced at the 2011 conference on Economic Development through Science and Technology Innovation in Rabat, Morocco attended by U.S. [[Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs]] Dr. Kerri-Ann Jones. This conference was the third and final consultative meeting to develop high impact engagement opportunities. Previous meetings were held in Alexandria, Egypt and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GIST Initiative Launches Innovation and Entrepreneurship Programs|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/06/166490.htm|agency=U.S. Department of State|publisher=Office of the Spokesperson|date=18 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GIST initiative exemplifies a science and technology innovation partnership that U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] called for in a 2009 speech at [[Cairo University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks by the President at Cairo University|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-at-Cairo-University-6-04-09|website=White House|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GIST assists entrepeneurs in 135 emerging economies through its Global Online Innovation Community, including online programming and mentorship; in-country training programs, the GIST Startup Boot Camps, GIST Ideation Boot Camps and GIST Villages; and the annual GIST Tech-I Global Pitch Competition.

==Global Online Innovation Community==

GISTNetwork is a government program led by the Department of State that provides a user-driven online resource to help young science and technology entrepreneurs in emerging economies build viable startups. GISTNetwork connects entrepreneurs to peers, mentors, experts, and financing both globally and within their communities.

GISTNetwork’s online community provides:  Mentors from top U.S. universities, Silicon Valley startups and local communities around the world; live and on-demand programming, including pages focused on specific local communities; and access to international angel investors and venture capitalists and a meeting place to find entrepreneurial team members.

==GIST Online Programming==

GIST online programming provides in-country entrepreneurs with direct online access to U.S. businesspeople and academics. The two key online programs are the GIST TechConnect and GIST Guru Series.

==GIST In-Country Training Programs== 
GIST in-country programs nurture the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs through direct, on-the-ground training.  Top U.S. and in-country leaders teach and mentor aspiring entrepreneurs, who also develop financial know-how and access to capital that allow them  to advance their science and technology ventures with skill and confidence. There are three main in-country programs: GIST Ideation Boot Camps; GIST Startup Boot Camps; and GIST Villages.

==GIST Tech-I Global Pitch Competition==

The GIST Tech-I Global Pitch Competition is an annual competition for science and technology entrepreneurs from emerging economies worldwide. Participants produce videos to pitch their ideas and startups, which are reviewed first by a panel of experts and then by the online voting public. Finalists receive a trip to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES), three months of one-to-one mentoring, and the chance to win seed capital.  Through two days of intensive training and pitching their ventures at the GES, GIST Tech-I finalists make connections and gain international exposure.

Since 2011, innovators from over 100 emerging economies have showcased their science and technology ventures through GIST Tech-I Global Pitch Competitions, with over one million votes from the online voting public.

The first Tech-I competition occurred in 2011 in Istanbul, Turkey. Notable Tech-I finalists have included Nermin Sa'd, founder of Hanadisayat.net from Jordan;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ghazal|first1=Mohammad|title=Mechanical engineers, mothers work from home to keep career passion alive|url=http://jordantimes.com/mechanical-engineers-mothers-work-from-home-to-keep-career-passion-alive|accessdate=4 August 2014|publisher=Jordan Times|date=30 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Natali Ardianto, founder and COO of Tiket.com from Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top Global Emerging Startups Showcase at D.C.

== Contributions ==
Burns is known for having analyzed the bankruptcy of the [[Allegheny University of the Health Sciences|Allegheny Health Education &amp; Research Foundation]], which owned the first [[medical school]] ever to go bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/1/7&lt;/ref&gt; He has testified to the [[Federal Trade Commission]] about clinical integration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ftc.gov/bc/healthcare/checkup/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831095141/http://ftc.gov/bc/healthcare/checkup/ |archivedate=2009-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as an expert witness for the [[Federal Trade Commission]] in its case against [[NorthShore University HealthSystem|Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Medical Group]].

Burns has analyzed physician-organization integration over the past twenty-five years. The last 13 years he spent studying the healthcare supply chain. He completed a book on supply chain management in the healthcare industry, The Health Care Value Chain (Jossey-Bass, 2002), and a recent analysis of alliances between imaging equipment makers and hospital systems. These studies focus on the strategic alliances and partnerships developing between pharmaceutical firms/distributors, disposable manufacturers, medical device manufacturers, group purchasing organizations, and organized delivery systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3429">A '''letter of comfort''', sometimes called a "letter of intent", is a communication from a party to a contract to the other party that indicates an initial willingness to enter into a contractual obligation absent the [[Contract#Elements|elements]] of a legally enforceable contract. The objective is to create a morally binding but not legally binding assurance.&lt;ref name="EUlaw"&gt;Mäntysaari, Petri. ''The Law of Corporate Finance: General Principles and EU Law.'' Heidelberg: Springer, 2010, p. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a letter of comfort is drafted only in vague terms, to avoid creating enforceable contract terms.&lt;ref name="Fontaine"&gt;Fontaine, Marcel and De Ly, Filip. ''Drafting International Contracts: An Analysis of Contract Clauses.'' Leiden: Martinus Nijhoff Pub., 2009, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Few nations regulate letters of comfort by statute; whether a letter of comfort creates legally enforceable contractual terms is often determined only by courts of law, based solely on the wording of the document.&lt;ref name="EUlaw" /&gt; Despite their nonbinding status, letters of comfort nonetheless provide risk mitigation because the parent company is putting its own reputation in jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Wei-Xin. ''Institutional Banking for Emerging Markets: Principles and Practice.'' Chichester: Wiley, 2007, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

In international contracts, letters of comfort are often used to assure a contracting party that a parent corporation will provide its subsidiary with the necessary resources to fulfill the contract.&lt;ref name="Fontaine" /&gt; However, under both international and [[European Union]] law, a letter of comfort does not require the parent corporation to fulfill the obligations incurred by its subsidiary.&lt;ref name="EUlaw" /&gt; When used to provide support for a subsidiary's actions, a letter of comfort usually consists of three terms:&lt;ref&gt;Bradgate, Robert and White, Fidelma. ''Commercial Law.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A statement from the parent organization acknowledging that its subsidiary has entered into a contract.
*A promise that the parent organization will not sever its legal relationship with the subsidiary until contractual terms are satisfied.
*A statement of comfort (e.g., "it is our policy" or "it is our intention") indicating how far the parent organization will go to support the subsidiary in fulfilling its contractual terms.

[[Canada]] recognizes two types of letters of comfort.  The weaker version, in which a parent organization acknowledges that a subsidiary has entered into a contract but which provides no assurance of intention, is called a ''letter of awareness''.  The stronger version, the letter of comfort, indicates the parent organization's intention to support the subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization. ''Dispute Settlement Reports 2002.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 1298.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, there is a general presumption against the enforceability of letters of comfort.  However, depending on the wording of the document, there may be legal liability under the rule of [[Estoppel|reliance]].&lt;ref&gt;Furmston, Michael; Tolhurst, G.J.; and Mik, Eliza. ''Contract Formation: Law and Practice.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''List of United States business school rankings''' is a tabular listing of some of the [[business school]]s and their affiliated [[university|universities]] located in the [[United States]] that are included in one or more of the rankings of full-time [[Master of Business Administration]] programs. Rankings are typically published by magazines or websites. This list is not a comprehensive [[list of business schools in the United States]]. These rankings are a subset of [[college and university rankings]]. Business schools are university-level institutions generally affiliated with a [[university]] or [[college]] that produces students who attain [[business administration]] degrees. Most of the schools listed in the rankings below are [[accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]]. Some of the publications shown here have related rankings for [[undergraduate]], [[part-time]] and executive curricula. There is currently some controversy among [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] and [[Academic administration|administrators]] in [[Higher education in the United States|American institutions of higher education]] regarding the request by the surveyors to have college presidents give their subjective opinion of other colleges because some of the methodologies are deemed misleading and a disservice. This has resulted in a movement surrounding the [[List of colleges and universities which have signed the Presidents Letter|President's letter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationconservancy.org/presidents_letter.html|title=President's Letter|publisher=The Education Conservancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing significance==
Business school rankings are important to the various business schools because they are an important [[marketing]] tool used to recruit top students, and lure [[recruiter]]s from the top companies. Business schools attempt to achieve higher rankings in order that they may obtain the top students who will over the course of their careers most likely benefit the school by achieving high ranking positions, attaining great influence, and accumulating great wealth. Such students often are able to help other students attain better (higher paying, more respected and more influential) jobs. Students use the rankings to choose their school,&lt;ref name=HtrcAmoj/&gt; and creators of the rankings produce them to aid in this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/about/faq_meth_brief.php#one|title=Frequently Asked Questions–Rankings|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report. L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than half of recruiters said they believe the quality of MBA graduates is the same or better currently compared with past years.  Some of the most renowned schools, such as Harvard and Stanford, do not rank as highly as their stature might suggest. Recruiters complain that they often find graduates of some of the most famous institutions more arrogant and less collegial than the MBAs they meet at other schools. Recruiters also noted that "some of the large, elite schools also don't seem to enjoy as many close, personal relationships with recruiters as smaller MBA programs do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Alsop | first =Ronald| title =M.B.A. Survey: Something Old, Something New | date =September 20, 2006  | url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115860376846766495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranking techniques==
The rankings are based on a variety of factors such as [[standardized test]] scores of students, [[salary]] of recent graduates, survey results of graduates and/or recruiters, the specific schools that choose to participate in a market survey, the number of top companies recruiting at the school and a variety of attributes.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.careerjournal.com/reports/bschool06/20060920-alsop-mblede.html|title=The Top Business Schools: Something Old, Something New|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.|date=2006-09-20|work=The Wall Street Journal Online |author=Alsop, Ronald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratings vary significantly by method used to determine the success of each program. For instance, the ''[[Forbes]]'' and ''[[Financial Times]]'' results are based on long-term graduate career progress concerns, the ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' and ''[[Economist]]'' polls evaluate short-term experiences of the students with their program, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' consider the recent experiences of recruiters with the program, and other rankings like the [[Aspen Institute]] ''Beyond Grey Pinstripes'' measure integration of sustainability material into business programs.&lt;ref name=HtrcAmoj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3ed8a91e-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|title=How the rankings compare: A matter of judgment|accessdate=2007-12-25|date=2007-01-29|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|author=Bradshaw, Della and Wai Kwen Chan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117100300/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3ed8a91e-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|archivedate=2008-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' uses a combination of the objective and subjective as well. The magazine seeks "expert opinion about program quality and statistical indicators that measure the quality of a school's faculty, research, and students." However, it ranks a broad spectrum of [[professional school]] programs such as business schools, [[law school]]s, and [[medical school]]s as well as a variety of programs specific [[academic discipline]]s such as the [[social science]]s or [[humanities]].&lt;ref name=USN&amp;WR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/about/08method_brief.php|title=How We Do the Numbers|author=Morse, Robert J. and Samuel Flanigan|accessdate=2007-12-07|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report. L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business opinion data incorporates responses from deans, program directors, and senior faculty about the academic quality of their programs as well as the opinions of professionals who actually do the hiring of the new MBA graduates from the schools. The statistical data combines measures of the qualities of the incoming students and as well as the faculty with measures of post graduate success as related to their degrees.&lt;ref name=USN&amp;WR/&gt; There were 382 programs that responded out of 402 solicited, and the formula used a strict combination of quality assessment (40%), placement success (35%), and student selectivity (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/about/08biz_meth_brief.php|title=Business Methodology|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report.

The ''Bloomberg Businessweek'' rankings, which are based on three sources of data (a student survey, a survey of corporate recruiters, and an intellectual capital rating), are published in mid-October of even numbered years.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/apr2006/bs20060420_4380.htm#MBA1|title=MBA Rankings: Updated October 2006|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.|work=BusinessWeek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 student survey of 45 online questions of students' ratings of their programs was distributed to 16,595 students three weeks before graduation; there were 9,290 responses. The recruiter survey determines how many [[MBA]]s a recruiter's company hired in the previous two years and which schools it actively recruits from. 223 respondents participated out of 426 solicited. The intellectual capital is determined based on a formula incorporating [[academic publishing|academic publication]]s in journals, books written, and faculty size.&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;

The ''Forbes magazine'' methodology was to calculate a five-year [[return on investment]] for 2002 graduates. ''Forbes'' surveyed 18,500 [[alumni]] of 102 MBA programs and used their pre-enrollment and post-graduate business school salary information as a basis for comparing post-MBA compensation with the cost of attending the programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/08/16/business-school-methodology-biz-07mba_cz_kb_0816bschoolmeth.html|title=Best Business Schools: Methodology|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=Forbes.com LLC|date=2007-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], the [[business information]] arm of the [[Economist Group]], gathered results from two [[internet]] [[questionnaire]]s, one of business schools and one of their students and recent graduates, and used them to rate business schools located all over the world. Information provided by the schools made up 80% of the ranking, with student and alumni responses accounting for only 20%. Factors in the evaluation included faculty:student ratio, GMAT scores of incoming students, student body diversity, foreign languages offered, percentage of graduates finding jobs within three months after graduation, percentage of graduates finding jobs through the school's career service, graduates' salaries and the comparison of pre-enrollment and post-graduation salaries, and student/alumni evaluations of the program, facilities, services, and alumni network. Results were tabulated using a [[smoothing]] method incorporating the three previous years' results. The organization used strict data provision thresholds, with the result that some highly regarded schools were omitted from the list of 100 ranked schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mba.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=wmba_rank_method|title=Rankings methodology|accessdate=2007-12-19|publisher=The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Financial Times'' poll was the result of over 10,000 respondents to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools. The survey began in July 2006 and all internationally accredited programs that are at least five years old and that have produced at least 30 graduates in each of the last three years were solicited. 113 of the 155 had at least 20 respondents and at least a 20 percent [[response rate (survey)|response rate]]. The questionnaire used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria to the reader. Eight criteria are based on alumni responses; eleven criteria are based on business school responses, and the final criterion is based on a research index produced by the ''Financial Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/39626150-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|title=How to read the rankings: How the raw data are processed|accessdate=2007-12-25|date=2007-01-29|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|author=Milton, Ursula|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217140636/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/39626150-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|archivedate=2007-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey responses are audited by [[KPMG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2ea93d06-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|title=Auditing: Aim for accuracy|accessdate=2007-12-25|date=2007-01-29|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|author=Bradshaw, Della|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227082805/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2ea93d06-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|archivedate=2007-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Financial Times'' has also produced a "ranking of rankings" summarizing five of the individual rankings (''The Economist'', ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', ''Wall Street Journal'', ''Forbes'', ''Financial Times''). They produce United States, and European summary rankings based on all five and a global summary ranking using the ''Wall Street Journal'', ''Economist'' and ''Financial Times''. The summary is based on underlying polls in which a school placed in the top ten using an [[average]] of the [[Ordinal scale|ordinal]] placements. The summary excludes the ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' results.&lt;ref name=HtrcAmoj/&gt;

The ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]'' includes every institution that has any [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Laureates]], [[Fields Medal]]s, and highly cited researchers. In addition, major universities of every country with significant amount of papers indexed by Science Citation Index-Expanded ([[Science Citation Index|SCIE]]) and Social Science Citation Index ([[Social Science Citation Index|SSCI]]) are also included. Having alumni of an institution winning [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prizes in Economics]] since 1951 attributes 10% of the score. Staff of an institution winning [[Turing Award]]s in computer science since 1961 contributes 15% of the score. Highly cited researchers in economics/business category get 25% weighting. Papers indexed in SSCI in economics/business fields gets 25%. Finally, the percentage of papers published in top 20% journals of economics/business fields to that in all economics/business journals gets 25% weighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arwu.org/ARWUSubjectMethodology2010.jsp|title=Ranking methodology|accessdate=2013-03-05|publisher=[[Shanghai Jiaotong University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rankings  based on attributes other than standardized test scores, salary of graduates, and similar attributes also exist. The ''[[Beyond Grey Pinstripes]]'' ranking, compiled by the [[Aspen Institute]] and published biannually, is based entirely on the integration of social and environmental stewardship into university curriculum and faculty research. Data for this survey is solicited from university administrators at accredited colleges, and audited by teams of Ph.D. scoring fellows. Rankings are calculated on the amount of [[sustainability]] coursework made available to students (20%), amount of student exposure to relevant material (25%), amount of coursework focused on stewardship by for-profit corporations (30%), and relevant faculty research (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondgreypinstripes.org/about/methodology.cfm|title=Methodology|accessdate=2011-06-18|publisher=Beyond Grey Pinstripes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 survey and ranking include data from 150 universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samuelson|first=Judy|title=The Business of Education: Why change-minded MBA candidates turn to the Institute before they pick a business school|journal=The Aspen Idea|date=Summer 2011|pages=66–67|url=http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|accessdate=18 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712011811/http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|archivedate=12 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The ranking of business schools has been discussed in articles and on academic websites.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | title = Caution and Controversy | publisher = [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] | date = 2007-06-22 | url = http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm | accessdate = 2008-01-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071026081654/http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm | archivedate = 2007-10-26 | df =  }} The article contains an extensive bibliography of critical sources.&lt;/ref&gt;
Critics of ranking methodologies maintain that any published rankings should be viewed with caution for the following reasons:&lt;ref name="MRN"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schatz |first=Martin |title=What's Wrong with MBA Ranking Surveys? |journal=Management Research News |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=15–18 |year=1993 |url=http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |doi=10.1108/eb028322 |last2=Crummer |first2=Roy E. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412110850/http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |archivedate=April 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rankings exhibit intentional selection bias as they limit the surveyed population to a small number of MBA programs and ignore the majority of schools, many with excellent offerings.
* Ranking methods may be subject to personal biases and statistically flawed methodologies (especially methods relying on subjective interviews of hiring managers, students, and/or faculty).
* Rankings use no objective measures of program quality.
* The same list of schools appears in each ranking with some variation in ranks, so a school ranked as number 1 in one list may be number 17 in another list.
* Rankings tend to concentrate on representing MBA schools themselves, but some schools offer MBA programs of different qualities and yet the ranking will only rely upon information from the full-time program (e.g., a school may use highly reputable faculty to teach a daytime program, but use adjunct faculty in its evening program or have drastically lower admissions criteria for its evening program than for its daytime program).
* A high rank in a national publication tends to become a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].
* Some leading business schools including Harvard, [[INSEAD]], [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] and [[MIT Sloan School of Management|Sloan]] provide limited cooperation with certain ranking publications due to their perception that rankings are misused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hemel | first=Daniel J | title=HBS Blocks Media Access to Students | publisher=[[The Harvard Crimson]] | date=12 April 2004 | url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=358753 | accessdate=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of [[MBA]] programs, one study found that ranking MBA programs by a combination of graduates' starting salaries and average student GMAT score can duplicate some of the ranking order found in top 20 lists of Business Week and U.S. News &amp; World Report.&lt;ref name="MRN" /&gt;

==Rankings==

===Historical rankings===
The historical rankings of the top MBA programs show little variation, even over a long time period. In 1977, ''MBA Magazine'' surveyed business schools deans to come up with a ranking which listed [[The Wharton School]], [[Harvard Business School]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]], the [[Booth School of Business]], and the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] as their top 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rush to the M.B.A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FQQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage|work=[[Kiplinger's Personal Finance]]|date=January 1979|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These schools plus the [[Kellogg School of Management]] have always comprised the top 5 schools in every [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Business Schools |url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/mba-rankings |work=US News and World Report |accessdate=6 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324142224/http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/mba-rankings |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the addition of [[Columbia Business School]], these seven schools which are most frequently listed at the top of various rankings (and are the top seven worldwide in the [[Business Insider]] ranking) have been referred to as "America's seven most powerful schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News from the schools, April 2010|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15895173|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2013}}
The [[American Legislative Exchange Council]], otherwise known by the [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] ALEC, is a non-profit [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)]] political organization established in 1973 in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alec.org/about-alec/history/ American Legislative Exchange Council website]&lt;/ref&gt; The legislative members are state and federal legislators. It is a forum to allow the members to write model laws and discuss legislative language with other members. ALEC meetings are an opportunity for the corporate and non-profit leaders to meet and provide feedback to legislators.  Member legislators can then use these model bills as templates for their own bills.

ALEC's vision statement is "A nonpartisan membership association for conservative state lawmakers who shared a common belief in limited government, free markets, federalism, and individual liberty. Their vision and initiative resulted in the creation of a voluntary membership association for people who believed that government closest to the people was fundamentally more effective, more just, and a better guarantor of freedom than the distant, bloated federal government in Washington, D.C."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALEC.org|url=http://www.alec.org/about-alec/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALEC keeps its membership, activities and communications confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lambert |first=Brian |url=http://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2013/08/alec-declares-itself-exempt-public-disclosure-laws-and-challenged |title=ALEC declares itself exempt from public-disclosure laws, and is challenged |publisher=MinnPost |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This list includes members whose identity primarily has become known through internal documents revealed to [[Common Cause]] and by research by members of the press.

==Task force members==

ALEC presently has 9 task forces to "commission research, publish papers, convene workshops, issue alerts, and serve as clearinghouses of information on free market policies in the states." Each task force is co-chaired by one state legislator (termed "public") and one corporate representative(termed "private"), but Private Co-Chairs have veto power over final decisions of their task force. The primary goal of these task forces is to develop model policies for the country. "The centerpiece to the Task Forces is ALEC's model legislation. To date, ALEC has considered, written, and approved hundreds of model bills, resolutions, and policy statements."&lt;ref name="Task Forces"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alec.org/task-forces/ |title=Task Forces; &amp;#124; ALEC – American Legislative Exchange Council |publisher=Alec.org, copyright 2013 |accessdate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902101217/http://www.alec.org/task-forces/ |archivedate=September 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malagos Agri-Ventures Corporation''' ([[Doing Business As|d.b.a.]] '''Malagos Chocolate''') is a [[Philippine]] [[List of bean-to-bar chocolate manufacturers|bean-to-bar]] [[chocolate]] manufacturer based in [[Davao City]].

==History==
The firm's history dates back to 2003, when company founders, Roberto and Charita Puentespina leased farm land in Malagos in the Baguio District of Davao City where [[Cacao bean|cacao]] trees were already in the area. Charita Puentespina then rehabilitated the farm which enabled the harvesting of cacao pods from the trees. She would use the harvested cacao beans to make ''tablea'' by roasting them in firewood then grinding and molding them.&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Heritage|url=http://malagoschocolate.com/our-heritage/|website=Malagos Chocolate|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The resulting chocolate were found to have a silky flavor.&lt;ref name="entre"&gt;{{cite news|title=How Malagos Chocolate found sweet success in the cocoa industry|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com.ph/run-and-grow/how-malagos-chocolate-found-sweet-success-in-the-cocoa-industry-adv-con|accessdate=9 August 2017|work=Entrepreneur Philippines|publisher=Entrepreneur Philippines , Inc.|date=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, the cocoa sustainability team of [[Mars, Incorporated]] connected with the Puentespinas to establish the Mars Cocoa Development Center where the farm of the Puentespinas learned agricultural practices related to cacao.&lt;ref name="entre"/&gt;

This venture led to the establishment of the Malagos Agri-Ventures Corporation on October 2012&lt;ref name="entre"/&gt; and the firm began producing [[single-origin]] [[cocoa liquor]]. Malagos Chocolate was commercially launched in June 2013 &lt;ref name="heritage"/&gt;and began producing other chocolate products.&lt;ref name="wins2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colina|first1=Antonio IV|title=Malagos Chocolate wins silver, bronze awards in London|url=http://news.mb.com.ph/2017/06/21/malagos-chocolate-wins-silver-bronze-awards-in-london/|accessdate=9 August 2017|work=Manila Bulletin|date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chocolate making and services==
[[File:Malagos 80percent dark chocolate.jpg|thumb|Malagos 85% Dark Chocolate packaging and chocolate bar.]]
Malagos cultivates their own cacao at their [[Bureau of Plant Industry (Philippines)|Bureau of Plant Industry]]-certified farm at the foothills of Mount Talomo. They are also responsible for the fermentation, drying, sorting, roasting of the cacao beans they use in their production of chocolate.&lt;ref name=mindanews&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colina|first1=Antonio IV|title=Davao chocolate wins anew|url=http://www.mindanews.com/top-stories/2017/06/davao-chocolate-wins-anew/|accessdate=9 August 2017|work=MindaNews|publisher=Mindanao News and Information Center Service Cooperative|date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their facility is situated {{convert|350|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Single-origin map|url=http://malagoschocolate.com/single-origin-map/|website=Malagos Chocolate|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm also buys beans from around 100 small-scale cocoa farmers in the Davao area&lt;ref name=wonka&gt;{{cite news|last1=De Veyra|first1=Jeeves|title=Meet Davao's Willy Wonka who put PH chocolate on the world map|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/04/17/18/meet-davaos-willy-wonka-who-put-ph-chocolate-on-the-world-map|accessdate=29 May 2018|work=ABS-CBN News|date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supplies cacao seeds, seedlings and [[Scion (grafting)|scions]] throughout [[Mindanao]].&lt;ref name=mindanews/&gt;In October 2017, It was reported that Malagos Chocolate along with other chocolate brands would be participating in “Salon du Chocolat” on October 28 to November 1 in Paris, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://davaotoday.com/main/culture-2/davao-chocolate-brands-earn-sweet-spot-in-paris/|title=Davao chocolate brands earn sweet spot in Paris|date=2017-10-10|work=Davao Today|access-date=2017-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Malagos has received international recognition for its chocolate garnering seven major international awards as of 2017. At the 2015 World Drinking Chocolate Competition by the International Chocolate Awards in [[Hannover]], [[Germany]], the chocolate maker was given a siver award for its Malagos Dark Chocolate.&lt;ref name="wins2017"/&gt;

'''Michael Diversey''' (born '''Diversy''' as shown on his grave in St. Boniface Catholic Cemetery in Chicago; December 10, 1810 – December 12, 1869) was an American [[brewing (beer)|beer brewer]], owner of the Diversey Beer Brewery. Diversey was an immigrant from Illingen [[Saarland]], Germany. He landed in the US in 1830, and went into partnership with English immigrant William Lill around 1841. The company changed its name and became the Lill &amp; Diversey Brewery, also known simply as The Chicago Brewery. It was destroyed in the [[1871 Great Chicago Fire]]

Michael Diversey was a philanthropist. He was also a Chicago alderman (1844–45; 1856–1868). During the 1850s, Diversey was active in the antiprohibitionist crusade that sought to repel the influence of temperance reformers who attempted to ban the sale and manufacture of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, Kyle G. (2014). ''Moral Minorities and the Making of American Democracy''. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 167, 173. {{ISBN|019937192X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Diversey Parkway]] in Chicago is named after him.
[[St. Michael's Church, Old Town, Chicago|St. Michael’s Catholic Church in Chicago]] was built on land donated to the parish by Michael Diversey. Until 1885, St. Michael’s was the tallest building in Chicago.

Married to Angela Diversy (June 10, 1810 – November 9, 1883). Oil portraits of Michael and Angela Diversy are in the collection of the [[Chicago History Museum]].

'''Mohammed al Fassi''' (1952 - Dec. 24, 2002), at times referred to as Prince al Fassi, was a [[Moroccan people|Moroccan]]/[[Saudi]] businessman related by marriage to the [[Saudi royal family]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/05/world/mohammed-al-fassi-50-upset-beverly-hills-over-house.html | title=Mohammed al-Fassi, 50; Upset Beverly Hills Over House | work=New York Times | date=January 5, 2003 | accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister was married to Prince[[Turki II bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Turki bin Abdul Aziz]], one of the brothers of Saudi King [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd al Saud]].&lt;ref name=Tele/&gt;

Al Fassi's notoriety stems largely from his 1978 purchase (for $2.4 million in cash)&lt;ref name="Tele" /&gt; of the 38-room white-stucco [[Max Whittier|Whittier Mansion]] on [[Sunset Blvd.]], Beverly Hills, which, soon after its acquisition, he had painted an unpopular shade of green. He further decorated the grounds of his new home by having the publicly visible statuary around the property painted in flesh tones, with pubic hair also colorfully painted,&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; raising the ire of many of his neighbors.&lt;ref name=Tele/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Ryon]], [http://articles.latimes.com/1985-06-02/realestate/re-15215_1_beverly-hills Article in LA Times], June 2,1985&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1979 the mansion was used as a filming location for ''[[The Jerk]]'' starring [[Steve Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank W. Martin,[http://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-jerk-made-detractors-eat-crow-vol-13-no-3/  Article in "People" Jan 1980]&lt;/ref&gt;  Within two years of its purchase, just after midnight on 1/2/81, the house was completely destroyed by a fire which was set by individuals burglarizing the house.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; The crowd that gathered to watch the spectacular fire, was characterized by amazement at how the inside wood, under the copper roof installed by the so-called Sheik, did not allow the Beverly Hills Firefighters to enter from above.  Afterward, when the fire was put down, the mansion was gutted. No one there cheered but may have been relieved that the awful edifice, which had exerted such a poor, kitch influence on the other owners of the nearby homes along Sunset Boulevard, was gone. Eventually in 2010, the home was replaced by two new homes, reflecting the other attractive homes in the area. &lt;I was an eyewitness&gt; which&lt;ref name=Tele&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1418179/Mohammed-al-Fassi.html | title=Mohammed al-Fassi | work=The Telegraph | date=8 Jan 2003 | accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Fassi soon relocated to Miami, joining other members of the Saudi royal family already there, and already provoking notoriety with helicopter commuting and large and unusual charitable contributions.  Among his exploits there were disputes over fencing he erected on city property, the hiring of city police officers to serve as security guards, a lawsuit from a contractor for unpaid bills, and a dust-up over a proposed Big Ben-style clock to be built on [[Star Island (Miami Beach)|Star Island]] in [[Biscayne Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Jaynes, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/27/us/royal-saudi-family-in-miami-shows-it-has-a-gift-for-giving.html?pagewanted=all Article in New York Times], May 27, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Fassi had mixed success as an animal lover; he was known to have adopted scores of stray cats, and to have purchased live birds, fish, and even lobsters in order to set them free, but he was also charged with animal cruelty when investigators from the Greater Miami Humane Society found evidence of neglect.&lt;ref name=Tele/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noaki Schwartz, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2003-01-03/news/0301030309_1_al-fassi-sheik-saudi-arabia  Article in Broward County Sun-Sentinel] Jan. 3, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Al Fassi was arrested in [[Jordan]] and hastily extradited to Saudi Arabia, where he was held without charges until his release to house arrest. His arrest stemmed from his having taken the side of Iraq in the [[Persian Gulf War]].  He made broadcasts from [[Baghdad]] denouncing Saudi Arabia for its participation in the war, for its human rights policies, and calling for democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis McLellan,[http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/31/local/me-sheik31 Article in LA Times], Dec 21, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Fassi died Dec. 24, 2002 in Cairo.  According to [[Marvin Mitchelson]], the divorce lawyer for his first wife, Sheika Dena al Fassi, he died of an infected hernia, and was survived by four grown children.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

'''[[Public relations]]''', despite being over a century old across the world, began in [[India]] in the early 1990s. Though there were several individuals and small companies which started even before that, they offered PR with the limited scope of media relations only. It was only natural that the entrepreneurs who began these services came from a background of journalism, seen as a natural hunting ground for the nascent PR industry.

==Agencies that started in India in the 1990s==

India came with many advantages in the context of PR - it showed a consistently high growth rate of the economy; the initial penetration of PR had been low leaving much scope for growth, the internet &amp; traditional media also penetrated exponentially giving rise to the quick rise of PR in India. Though some international PR agencies (usually offshoots of advertising agencies) like [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather|Ogilvy PR]] set base in India in the mid-1980s, they floundered to find a firm footing especially since their core focus remained mainly in advertising services. By the early 1990s, after the opening up of the Indian economy, several other PR agencies started with a core focus on PR alone like Lexicon PR in 1996. This decade also saw the advent of Indian IPO agencies offshoots like Ad factors PR began to offer PR services as a freebee along with their IPO services. These recent past b2p relations has been emerging as a best PR practice in Chennai. And media monitoring across South India is now made possible through b2p relations.

==Agencies that started in India in the 2000s==

If the 90s were the starting block for the Indian PR sector, the next decade was the growth era. Significant in this time was the full buyout of Genesis by [[Burson Marsteller]], and the investment in [Hanmer &amp; Partners]&lt;ref&gt;http://hanmermsl.com/&lt;/ref&gt; by MS&amp;L, a Publicis company. [[Edelman (firm)|Edelman]] entered India with by taking over Roger Periera, the grand old man of PR. In 2002, specialist agencies like Blue Lotus Communications took birth with a focus on specialized sectors like Healthcare, Technology, Finance and Brands. With the decade almost coming to a close, 2008 saw the birth of i9 Communications,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i9c.in&lt;/ref&gt; as a specialist in consumer communication, with special focus on Brands, Lifestyle, Entertainment and Hospitality PR. Several such boutique agencies also started in other parts of the country.

After the [[economic slowdown]] and the resultant market crashes worldwide, several international PR agencies suffered enormous losses when clients cut back marketing budgets. This forced these agencies to turn to higher growth markets like [[India]] and [[China]]. India naturally took a higher priority due to its large English-speaking base, stable political governance and consistent legal structure. The color of the market has flowered from grey to blue in this decade and the corporate's need for [[image building]] and strategic PR is very well understood and accepted.

According to the 2007 report on The State of the Public Relations Industry &lt;ref&gt;http://www.huntsworth.co.uk/docs/Paul%20Holmes%20Report%20-%20The%20State%20of%20the%20PR%20Industry.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; prepared by Paul Holmes (author of the Holmes Report&lt;ref&gt;http://www.holmesreport.com&lt;/ref&gt;), the western growth of PR has almost plateaued to a stable range of 9% to 11%, with the growth geographies being India (as too China) growing at four times the Western pace. To quote the report, "The greatest future in growth is expected to come in China and India, with good prospects for growth in Eastern Europe (particularly those countries recently admitted to the European Union) and in the Middle East (albeit from a very small base)". However, in 2012, the PR market has slowed down due to the overcrowding of the market.
The recession of 2008 &amp;2009 gave birth to another terminology in India -Regional PR and the companies who were once upon a time hooked to pink papers, looking for presence in regional dailies. Regional Public Relations set up country's first such agency where core focus was on Tier-II &amp; Tier-III cities.   
Naturally then, India and similar paced economies have become favored destinations for global PR firms keen to extract their share of growth from this market. The late realization by many global majors that India has an equal or superior potential than China, has left quite a few panting in the race for market-share. However, in 2012, the PR market has slowed down due to the overcrowding of the market with too many fighting for too few.
year 2009 again witness the rising of this industry but more over in tier II markets. Some regional specialist came up very fast to serve the vast PR business in secondary markets. Regional Public Relations was first such PR agency who rolled down from tier-II market only.

Sparkling Stories, a well known Pune based PR agency was also founded in this decade and in small time it took a giant step in the movies and consumer products area.

The first Public Relations agency of North East India, Cabsford PR, was set up in 2002 by Nurul Islam Laskar, former Chief Manager (PR &amp; Community Services Banking) State Bank of India. [[Life's Purple]] is now among one of the big agencies operating from [[Guwahati]], working across [[Northeast India]].

Now PR has started touching the boundaries of advertising &amp; marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/302496|title=The Changing Horizons of PR Industry|last=|first=|date=2017-10-11|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-02-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2016, digital consulting company #ARM Worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://armworldwide.com/service/pr/|title=PR Consulting Firm|last=|first=|date=|website=armworldwide.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; started their dedicated PR unit and within a year emerged as an organisation for executing most creative PR stunt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketing-interactive.com/pr-awards/sea-2017/winners/|title=Winners {{!}} PR Awards 2017 Southeast Asia|website=www.marketing-interactive.com|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; apart from getting various accolades from reputed organisation like IPRCA 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.exchange4media.com/Marketing/Adfactors-PR-Value360-Communications-Godrej-big-winners-at-IPRCCA-2016_67026.html|title=Adfactors PR, Value360 Communications, Godrej big winners at IPRCCA 2016|work=Indian Advertising Media &amp; Marketing News – exchange4media|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fulcrum Awards 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fulcrumawards.com/winners-2017|title=Winners 2017|last=fluid-digital.com|website=www.fulcrumawards.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; IAMAI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iamaiida.in/lastYearWinners.php|title=IAMAI - India Digital Awards|website=www.iamaiida.in|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a list of top PR agency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Who-is-the-top-PR-agency-in-India/answer/Honey-Singh|title=Details about Top PR agency in India|last=|first=|date=|website=Quora|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which started in 2000s, APCO Worldwide India, Concept, H+K Strategies India, Golinopinion, Cohn &amp; Wolfe Six Degrees, Communincate India, PR Pundit, Aim High Consulting, Madison Public Relations, Integral are few of them.

==PR Crisis in India and its mitigation==

On January 7, 2009, Ramalinga Raju, the erstwhile chairman of Satyam Ltd., India's leading IT firm, made an admission of conscious fraud &amp; misreporting perpetrated by him over several years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livemint.com/2009/01/08205554/Nuts-and-bolts-of-Satyam-saga.html&lt;/ref&gt; The media who had eulogized him till then, suddenly turned on him with a vengeance, conscious that they had also failed in their duty as watchdogs of businesses. This crisis, coincided with the peak of the global crisis and held the potential to snowball into a credibility &amp; trust issue for brand India and its IT firms, where several billion dollars worth of services were being outsourced every year. The crisis also impacted several companies associated with Satyam including EMRI (Emergency Medical Response Insititute &lt;ref&gt;http://www.emri.in&lt;/ref&gt;), a not-for-profit endeavour (for running free ambulance services) in which Satyam had committed 5% of running costs with the balance 95% coming from various state governments.

However, the Indian government took quick action and set up an interim board consisting of industry stalwarts for the company to assess the true worth of Satyam and to seek a suitable investor &amp; management.The swiftly conducted and fiercely contested bid was won by Mahindra &amp; Mahindra and Satyam was merged with a group IT company.

== Crisis in the Indian PR industry ==

After the global slowdown that hit Indian Public relation agencies in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/global-crisis-hits-indian-pr-industry/51181/on&lt;/ref&gt; it took a further hit in November 2010 due to what has come to be known as the 'Radiagate' scam. Open Magazine in an exposé, covered the story of Niira Radia's nefarious power-dealings. An Income Tax phone tap collected more than 5000 tapes and hundreds of these tapes were leaked and found their way into Outlook magazine's website. The [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) interrogated Radia several times and as a fallout of the tapes, the Telecom minister, A. Raja, with whom Radia had close links was also forced to resign.  Several prominent journalists like Barkha Dutt and Vir Sanghvi were also in the middle of the quagmire, caught in power-lobbying conversations with Radia.

== PR Education and academics in India ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

== Growth of Public Relations in India==

With several initiatives and boost support taking into account the rise in Digital Innovation many Indian PR Agencies started expanding their viewpoint via integrating more expertise with respect to Image Management needs of Indian Corporations seeking PR Support. The Assocham report released in March 2010 shows the growth of the PR industry in India to grow to US$6 billion by end of 2010 with a CAGR of approximately 32%. The study reports the biggest challenges of the PR industry to be the following: 
* Lure of better pay: Skilled manpower is scarce, professionals will be poached for higher salaries.
* Leadership crisis: Not too many established players, presenting a crisis of leadership in middle &amp; smaller firms, which makes people move to larger, more reputed PR agencies.
* Lack of understanding of PR: Most people, even from sibling professions, don’t understand PR.
* Perception issues: Many stakeholders, including media and corporate organizations, consider PR to be similar to that of a spin job.

Considering this, for this fledgling, but fast growing sector to flourish, the need of academic rigor and theoretical pedagogy is essential

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5183">A '''Referee in Bankruptcy''' or '''Bankruptcy Referee''' was a federal official with quasi-judicial powers, appointed by a [[United States district court]] to administer [[bankruptcy]] proceedings, prior to 1979. The office was first created by the [[Bankruptcy Act of 1898]], and was abolished by the [[Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978]], which created separate [[United States bankruptcy court]]s with permanently assigned [[judge]]s.&lt;ref name=fjc&gt;{{cite web|title=Bankruptcy Referees|url=http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/admin_03_03.html|work=fjc.gov|publisher=Federal Judicial Center|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The Bankruptcy Act of 1898&lt;ref&gt;Act of July 1, 1898, Ch. 541, 30 Stat. 544.&lt;/ref&gt; established the position of bankruptcy referee "to assist in expeditiously transacting the bankruptcy business". The act specified that referees were to be appointed by the district court for a term of two years, although they could be removed from office or have their jurisdiction over a particular case revoked at any time. The courts could appoint the referees in such numbers "as may be necessary". The fees paid by petitioners in bankruptcy proceedings were used to compensate the referees.&lt;ref name="fjc"/&gt;

All three earlier, short-lived acts providing for bankruptcy jurisdiction in the federal courts had made provision for the appointment of officers to assist in the administration of bankruptcy cases. The act of 1800&lt;ref&gt;2 Stat. 19, repealed in 1803.&lt;/ref&gt; authorized district judges to appoint commissioners with various powers to declare a person a bankrupt, to take possession of a bankrupt's estate, and to assign the bankrupt's property. The next bankruptcy act, in 1841&lt;ref&gt;5 Stat. 440, repealed in 1843.&lt;/ref&gt; provided for the appointment of commissioners to receive proof of debts and carry out other administrative duties related to bankruptcy cases. The Act that governed federal bankruptcy from 1867 to 1878&lt;ref&gt;14 Stat. 517.&lt;/ref&gt; instructed district judges to appoint '''registers in bankruptcy''', who would be nominated by the Chief Justice and assist the judges in a wide range of tasks related to bankruptcy proceedings.&lt;ref name="fjc"/&gt;

Bankruptcy referees appointed under the Act of 1898 performed a wide range of judicial and administrative functions during the early part of the twentieth century, including the following: the consideration and adjudication of bankruptcy petitions submitted to the district courts; the examination of property schedules and lists of creditors filed by bankrupts; the administering of oaths and depositions to witnesses in bankruptcy proceedings; the maintenance of the records in such proceedings and the transmission of such records to the clerk of court; and the distribution of the property of bankrupts in cases where the district court judge was absent. Referees' decisions on substantive matters were subject to review by the district court.&lt;ref name="fjc"/&gt;

Such duties made each referee a combination of special master and estate administrator until the late 1930s, when Congress transferred many of their administrative functions to bankruptcy trustees or clerks of court and increased the referees' judicial functions. The [[Chandler Act]] of 1938&lt;ref&gt;52 Stat. 840.&lt;/ref&gt; granted referees the authority to adjudicate petitions referred to them, to administer oaths and examine witnesses, and to act for the judge in certain instances.&lt;ref name="fjc"/&gt;

In 1946, Congress provided a fixed salary for referees, increased their tenure from two to six years, and limited the circumstances under which they could be removed from office to incompetence, misconduct, or neglect of duty. In 1973 the Supreme Court acknowledged the increasingly judicial nature of the referees' work when it prescribed a set of bankruptcy rules that employed the term "bankruptcy judge" interchangeably with "referee".

In the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 95-598, 92 Stat. 2549, 2657 (Nov. 6, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Congress enacted the current U.S. Bankruptcy Code,&lt;ref&gt;Title 11 of the United States Code.&lt;/ref&gt; abolished the office of bankruptcy referee and established bankruptcy judgeships to serve separate bankruptcy courts in each judicial district. While these judges assumed the referees' judicial duties, the remaining administrative functions in most districts were transferred to trustees whose offices were placed under the supervision of the Department of Justice.&lt;ref name="fjc"/&gt;

'''Share transmission''' is a mechanism by which the title to [[Share (finance)|share]]s is devolved other than by transfer. This is typically applicable for:
* devolution by death
* succession
* inheritance
* bankruptcy
* marriage

When a previous owner of shares dies and his shares are inherited by his personal representatives or heirs, this is called transmission of shares.Shares may be inherited only by production of probate of a will of the deceased owner or letters of administration of his estate granted by the High Court.(section 148 of COMPANIES AND ALLIED MATTERS ACT (CAMA)under NIGERIAN LAW ).  The beneficiaries of the shares by transmission must have their names entered in the register of members of the company or elect a nominee to hold the shares on their behalf.  In this case the nominee’s name shall be entered in the Register of members of the company to become a member of the company.(section 155 (3) of CAMA).

== Transfers on Transmission of shares ==

Transmission of shares occurs when the shares of a deceased share holder are inherited or bequeathed to an heir or personal representative of the deceased shareholder. Where shares are held by two or more persons jointly then upon death of one or more of them, the surviving person shall be entitled to all the shares and they may be transferred to his name. Where the shareholder held the shares as a sole owner, then his shares may be transferred only to the person named in his will or if he died without a will, then to the person who obtains letters of administration from the High Court in respect of the shares or the deceased’s property. Section 148 of CAMA.  The above are in Law recognized as the personal representatives of the deceased share holder and are entitled to have his shares transferred to them or their nominee. (Section 155 of CAMA).

=== Protection of Beneficiaries under a will ===  
Sometimes a deceased member may name some persons as the administrators of his estate who are to ensure the deceased’s properties are distributed and/or managed as stated in the will.  These persons therefore inherit the deceased persons shares on behalf and for the benefit of those who are named in the will as the beneficiaries inherit. The administrators therefore only have an equitable right in the shares but not the beneficial rights.This right becomes a legal right only when the shares are transferred to those entitled under the will.  It is the duty of the executors of the will who in this case are the personal representatives of the deceased to ensure that they nominate those entitled to the shares under the will as those to whom the shares should be transferred to. (section 155 (3) of CAMA).

Any person claiming to have an interest in any shares or the dividends or interest on those shares may protect his interest by swearing to an affidavit indicating the nature of his interest and serving the company with the affidavit.  The company shall then enter on the register of members the fact that such notice has been served on the company.  The company shall therefore not register any transfer of shares of the deceased in respect of which it had received the affidavit of interest. 
Any company which receives this notice of interest and in default proceeds to register any transfer in favor of any other person shall be personally liable to the person who lodged the notice of interest for any loss he suffers thereby.  (Section 156 of CAMA) 
The Company shall give notice of at least 42 days to any other person seeking a transfer to him, of the shares complained of, for the matter to be resolved otherwise, the proposed transfer will not be effected. section 156 (2)CAMA.
 
''Ownership'': on registration of the transmission of shares, the person entitled to transmission of shares becomes the shareholder of the company and is entitled to all rights and subject to all liabilities as such shareholder.

''Method'': while transfer of shares is brought about by delivery of a proper instrument of transfer (viz, [[transfer deed]]) duly stamped and executed, transmission of shares is done by forwarding the necessary documents (such as a notarised copy of death certificate) to the company.

==Legal process==
In the case of death, the surviving shareholders have to submit a request letter supported by an attested copy of the death certificate of the deceased shareholder and the relevant share certificates. The company’s registrar and share transfer agent on receipt of the said documents will delete the name of deceased shareholder from its records and return the share certificates to the applicant/registered holder with necessary endorsement.

== Early life and education ==
Sigfusson was born in the [[Heimaey|Vestman Islands]] archipelago just off the south coast of [[Iceland]]. He completed his BA degree from [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jedc.org/innovation/2014-speakers |title= 2014 SPEAKERS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After completing his MS degree in Economics in 1993, he became a special advisor to the Minister of Finance of Iceland in January 1994. After working there for four years, he left the ministry to join the [[Nordic Investment Bank]] as deputy managing director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/sigfusson/|title=Thor Sigfusson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2003, he left Nordic Investment bank and joined Iceland Chamber of Commerce as Managing Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fis.com/fis/people/profile.asp?l=e&amp;author_id=45 |title=Thor Sigfusson|publisher=FIS|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Sigfusson joined Sjova Insurance as Managing Director of the company. He left Sjova Insurance in 2009 and joined [[University of Iceland]] for PhD in Business. In his studies he focused on how entrepreneurs used networks in their internationalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sjavarklasinn.is/en/in-celebration-of-cod-day-interview-with-thor-sigfusson/|title=  In Celebration of Cod Day: Interview with Thor Sigfusson}}&lt;/ref&gt; His studies indicated companies and entrepreneurs in the marine industry were not well connected with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2015/08/27/bidder-for-maine-bond-funds-plans-marine-cluster-on-waterfront/ |title=Consortium plans ‘marine cluster’ similar to Iceland’s on Portland waterfront}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began working on a network to increase interaction between marine tech companies and launched the Iceland Ocean Cluster in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redherring.com/startups/icelands-startup-scene-punches-weight/ |title= Iceland’s Startup Scene Punches Above its Weight}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cluster focuses on developing innovative ideas in the fishing industry. In May 2012, Sigfusson founded the Ocean Cluster House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/business/article_514cb88e-5425-11e6-8d40-875625b06c9c.html|title=  Tuna leather?

Since establishing the Iceland Ocean Cluster, Sigfusson has spent his time speaking to audience in US and Europe about the opportunities in building networks in the marine industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.undercurrentnews.com/2013/12/19/icelandic-innovator-churning-out-marine-tech-spinoffs/|title= Icelandic innovator churning out marine tech spinoffs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Sigfusson co-founded a sister cluster to the IOC, the New England Ocean Cluster to drive new ideas in the marine industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainebiz.biz/article/20141016/NEWS0101/141019974/portland-waterfront-to-be-site-of-new-england-ocean-'cluster'|title= Portland waterfront to be site of New England ocean 'cluster'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2014/11/06/une-fronts-united-bid-for-bond-funds/ |title= UNE leads pursuit of marine funding from bond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the research and information generated from Iceland Ocean Cluster, Sigfusson founded Codland in September 2012. Codland emerged as the merger of a biotechnology company and fishing companies with plans to fully utilize byproducts from the North Atlantic Cod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20150316/NEWS/150319580 |title= From Iceland to New Bedford: Waste not, want not for fisheries}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cluster also initiated the North Atlantic Marine Cluster Project, which works to increase relations between ocean and marine industries in the North Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portland follows Iceland model for waterfront business incubator|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2015/03/17/business/portland-follows-iceland-model-for-waterfront-business-incubator/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he founded the company Collagen with the aim to use fish skin to create marine collagen. In 2016 he co-founded Hlemmur Food Hall, Sjó-Food Hall and Reykjavik Foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pressherald.com/2016/01/20/maine-startup-lobster-tough-llc-developing-a-childrens-bandage-from-lobster-shells/|title= Maine startup Lobster Tough LLC developing a children’s bandage from lobster shells}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maineandthearctic.com/event-listings/2016/10/17/harnessing-networks-to-create-value|title= Thor Sigfusson: Harnessing Networks to Create Value}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
University of Economics - then the College of Social and Economic Sciences - was opened to students on January 11, 1937 when first lectures at the Faculty of Industrial Organisation took place. The first [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the University was Dr. Józef Lisak. Not long after the foundation of the University, the [[World War II]] began and the school was closed between September 1939 and February 1945.

After the war, the number of students increased very quickly and the University authorities decided to move both the [[academic]] and [[Academic administration|administrative]] sections from the Śląskie Techniczne Zakłady Naukowe (Silesian School of Technology) buildings to the old city hall in Katowice-Zawodzie (Rector's Office) and Building A at Bogucicka street. The academic year 1946/1947 was inaugurated in the new buildings.

In 1950 the [[Polish government]] decided to standardize economic education in the whole country. At that time, the name of the University was changed to State College of Economic Administration. In 1972, to mark its 35th anniversary, the University was given the name of Karol Adamiecki and two years later the school gained its present name.

Latest changes include [[modernization]] of the old buildings, as well as the opening of new [[didactic]]-accommodation facilities. The organization of the University has also undergone some changes related to the growing number of faculties and specializations, such as the foundation of the Faculty of Finance and Insurance in 2002 and the Faculty of Informatics and Communication in 2009.

By the decision of the Polish Parliament, since 1 October 2010 the name of the institution in Polish changes from "Akademia Ekonomiczna im. Karola Adamieckiego w Katowicach" to "Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach".

The '''University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center''' ('''U-PARC''') is a one-million-square foot (93,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), high-security research park campus of the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Comprising 53 buildings situated on over {{convert|85|acre|km2}}, U-PARC is located {{convert|14|mi|km}} from [[Downtown Pittsburgh]] in [[Harmar Township, Pennsylvania]] adjacent to the [[Pennsylvania Route 28|Route 28]] expressway and [[Interstate 76 (Ohio–New Jersey)|Interstate 76]], the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://e-ditionsbyfry.com/Olive/AM3/TEQ/Default.htm?href=TEQ%2F2009%2F10%2F01&amp;pageno=26&amp;view=document | first=Matt | last=Pross | title=Tech Mecca | journal=Pittsburgh Teq | publisher=Pittsburgh Technology Council | location=Pittsburgh | volume=15 | issue=6 | page=26 | date=2009-09-10 | accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded as the research laboratories of [[Gulf Oil]] in 1933 and moved to Harmar Township in 1935. It served many decades as one of the leading industrial research centers in the world, with labs engaging in petroleum, chemical, polymer, refining, and nuclear research. At its peak, it employed over 2,000 scientists and engineers and had an annual budget of $100 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000000|1985|r=1}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). Upon Gulf Oil's acquisition by [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron Oil]] in 1985, the research park was donated to the University of Pittsburgh in order to keep the center open for the benefit of the region.

U-PARC is home to more than 100 different companies from around the world, including several [[Fortune 500]] Companies.  In addition, the university's [[Swanson School of Engineering]] maintains laboratories and its Manufacturing Assistance Center at the site. It also serves as the home to the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences|School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences]]' Masters of Science program in Physician Assistant Studies.

==Manufacturing Assistance Center==
The Manufacturing Assistance Center (MAC), located in Building A-11 of U-PARC, is a working factory opened in November 1994 as an initiative of the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s [[Swanson School of Engineering]]'s Department of Industrial Engineering that offers technical assistance and educational resources to the academic and industrial community of [[Western Pennsylvania]]. It also serves as an incubator for manufacturing innovation and as a center for technology transfer.  The MAC provides access to advanced manufacturing technology, encourages its adoption, and assists in training and educating students in its use. The center comprises a synergistic network of laboratories encompassing machine tooling, computer-aided design and manufacturing, metrology, materials tracking, and human issues.

The MAC began following a 1990 survey of 550 Western Pennsylvania manufacturers by the Department of Industrial Engineering that revealed the need for manufacturing support services in this part of the state.&lt;ref name="aboutMac"&gt;{{cite web | title=About the MAC | url=http://www.engr.pitt.edu/mac/about_mac.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611165320/http://www.engr.pitt.edu/mac/about_mac.htm | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | location=Pittsburgh | archivedate=2007-06-11 | accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response a concept of shared manufacturing was created by Pitt School of Engineering professors Dr. Bopaya Bidanda and Dr. [[David I. Cleland]], and a proposal describing how the MAC would meet this need resulted in a $2.3 million grant from the [[Economic Development Administration]] of the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]].  The center's purpose is to provide research and educational support to the University of Pittsburgh, as well as to provide small and mid-sized manufacturers of Western Pennsylvania with the tools to compete in the global marketplace.  As such, area manufacturers can receive demonstrations on new equipment and manufacturing processes, perform pilot manufacturing, and conduct limited production utilizing the resources available in the MAC labs. In addition to these services, the MAC also provides training on [[computer numerical control]] (CNC) machining, [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM), and [[computer-integrated manufacturing]] (CIM), plus a variety of other concepts, such as materials requirements planning, total quality management, and team development, that are utilized by modern manufacturing organizations.  Working in partnership with private industry, the MAC is part of the development of the regional RoboCorridor, promoting automation and agile [[robotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.engr.pitt.edu/mac/ |title=Manufacturing Assistance Center | accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MAC's {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}} of available space contains a working factory, classrooms, and administration offices and supplies secure space for startup companies wishing to access its facilities. The factory has a 5-ton and a 1-ton overhead crane, a loading dock, 220 and 480 volt 3-phase power, a paint room, and welding booths. The space is subdivided into classrooms, a conference room, a computer laboratory designed for CAD/CAM training, offices and training areas for manual, welding training, and CNC and [[Electrical discharge machining|EDM]] machine tool and precision grinding training. The facility also includes two classrooms seating 24 and 12 students, respectively, as well as five offices, a metrology lab, and a computer lab.

'''''Wall Street''''' is an American [[Pre-Code]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] released on December 1, 1929 and was produced by [[Harry Cohn]], directed by [[Roy William Neill]], and starred [[Ralph Ince]], [[Aileen Pringle]], [[Sam De Grasse]], [[Philip Strange]], and [[Freddie Burke Frederick]].

==Synopsis== 
A very topical early talkie from low-budget company [[Columbia Pictures]], Wall Street starred Ralph Ince, brother of producer Thomas H. Ince, as Roller McCray, a steelworker turned ruthless tycoon whose tough business methods leads a rival (Philip Strange) to commit suicide. The widow (Aileen Pringle), believing she can ruin Ince by using his own methods, conspires with her husband's former partner (Sam De Grasse), but a strong friendship between Ince and Pringle's young son (Freddie Burke Frederick) changes things dramatically. According to future Three Stooges director Edward Bernds, who worked as a sound mixer on Wall Street, Ince's reaction to his rival's suicidal jump from a window ledge was changed from a sneering "I didn't think he had the guts" to the more respectful "I didn't think he'd do it" due to derisive laughter from the film's crew.

A '''wrecking yard''' ([[Australian English|Australian]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], and [[Canadian English]]), '''scrapyard''' ([[Hiberno-English|Irish]], [[British English|British]] and [[New Zealand English]]) or '''junkyard''' ([[American English]]) is the location of a business in dismantling where wrecked or decommissioned [[vehicles]] are brought, their usable parts are sold for use in operating vehicles, while the unusable metal parts, known as [[scrap]] metal parts, are sold to metal-[[recycling]] companies. Other terms include '''wreck yard''', '''wrecker's yard''', '''salvage yard''', '''breakers yard''', '''dismantler''' and '''scrapheap'''. In the United Kingdom, car salvage yards are known as '''car breakers''', while motorcycle salvage yards are known as '''bike breakers'''. In Australia, they are often referred to as 'Wreckers'.

==Types of wreck yards==
{{Further|Aircraft boneyard|Shipbreaking}}
The most common type of wreck yards are [[automobile]] wreck yards, but junkyards for [[motorcycle]]s, [[bicycle]]s, small [[airplane]]s and [[boat]]s exist too.

==Scrapyard==
A scrapyard is a recycling center that buys and sells scrap metal. Scrapyards are effectively a [[scrap metal]] [[brokerage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isri.org/iMIS15_PROD/ISRI/About_ISRI/Industry_Facts/ISRI/Navigation/AboutISRI/Industry_Facts.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910085202/http://www.isri.org/iMIS15_PROD/ISRI/About_ISRI/Industry_Facts/ISRI/Navigation/AboutISRI/Industry_Facts.aspx|date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scrap yards typically buy any base metal; for example, [[iron]], [[steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[brass]], [[copper]], [[aluminum]], [[zinc]], [[nickel]], and [[lead]] would all be found at a modern-day scrapyard. Scrapyards will often buy electronics, appliances, and metal vehicles. Scrapyards will sell their accumulations of metals either to refineries or larger scrap brokers. [[Metal theft]] is committed so thieves can sell stolen copper or other stolen valuable metals to scrapyards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/35946?t51hb&amp;hpg1=mp |title=FBI: Copper thieves jeopardize US infrastructure |publisher=Networkworld.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
{{See also|Vehicle recycling}}

Many salvage yards operate on a local level—when an automobile is severely damaged, has malfunctioned beyond repair, or not worth the repair, the owner may sell it to a junkyard; in some cases—as when the car has become disabled in a place where derelict cars are not allowed to be left—the car owner will pay the wrecker to haul the car away. Salvage yards also buy most of the wrecked, derelict and abandoned vehicles that are sold at auction from police impound storage lots, and often buy vehicles from insurance tow yards as well. The salvage yard will usually tow the vehicle from the location of its purchase to the yard, but occasionally vehicles are driven in. At the salvage yard the automobiles are typically arranged in rows, often stacked on top of one another. Some yards keep inventories in their offices, as to the usable parts in each car, as well as the car's location in the yard.  Many yards have computerized inventory systems. About 75% of any given vehicle can be recycled and used for other goods.

In recent years it is becoming increasingly common to use satellite part finder services to contact multiple salvage yards from a single source. In the 20th century these were [[call centre]]s that charged a premium rate for calls and compiled a facsimile that was sent to various salvage yards so they could respond directly if the part was in stock. Many of these are now Web-based with requests for parts being e-mailed instantly.

[[File:Newtown scrap crane jeh.JPG|thumb|Loading a barge in New York]]

Often parts for which there is high demand are removed from cars and brought to the salvage yard's [[warehouse]]. Then a customer who asks for a specific part can obtain it immediately, without having to wait for the salvage yard employees to remove that part. Some salvage yards expect customers to remove the part themselves (known as "self-service yards"), or allow this at a substantially reduced price compared to having the junkyard's staff remove it.  This style of yard is often referred to as a "You Pull It" yard.

However, it is more common for a [[customer]] to call in and inquire whether the specific item he/she needs is available. If the yard has the requested item, the customer is usually instructed to leave a [[deposit account|deposit]] and to come to pick up the part at a later time. The part is usually installed by the customer or agent ("the customer's [[mechanic]]"); however, some salvage yards also provide installation services.

The parts usually dismantled from automobiles are generally any that can be resold such as the light assemblies (commonly known as just "lights", e.g. [[headlight]]s, blinkers, taillights), seats, parts of the [[exhaust system]], [[mirror]]s, [[hubcap]]s etc. Late model vehicles will often have entire halves or portions of the body removed and stored on shelves as inventory. Other major parts such as the [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] and [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] are often removed and sold, usually to auto-parts companies that will rebuild the part and resell it with a warranty, or will sell the components as-is in used condition, either with or without warranty. Other, usually very large, junkyards will rebuild and sell such parts themselves. Unbroken [[windshield]]s and [[window]]s may also be removed intact and resold to car owners needing replacements.  Some salvage yards will sell damaged or wrecked but repairable vehicles to amateur car builders, or older vehicles to collectors, who will restore ("rebuild") the car for their own use or entertainment, or sometimes for resale.  These cars are known as "rebuilders".

Once vehicles in a wrecking yard do not have more usable parts, the hulks are usually sold to a scrap-metal processor, who will usually [[Car crusher|crush the bodies]] on-site at the yard's premises using a mobile baling press, shredder, or flattener, with final disposal occurring within a [[hammer mill]] which smashes the vehicle remains into fist-sized chunks. These chunks are then sold by multiple tons for further processing and recycling.

Zeng entered politics in 1991, when he became a [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] member; thereafter he renounced his affiliation to the group and has since become a [[perennial]] candidate in Singaporean elections, albeit often dropping out of contention at the last minute. Zeng was also an active acupuncturist who arranged for global meetings and operated an acupuncture centre in Singapore, later changing his focus to selling healthcare products after a string of molestation lawsuits initiated by his patients. Zeng was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2014; this necessitated the excision of his entire [[Human nose|nose]], which led to significant facial disfigurement, and he became a tissue paper peddler, abandoning his previous jobs. Aspects of Zeng's life, including his court cases and unorthodox behaviour, have generated controversy and criticism.

==Early life==
Zeng was born Chan Hock Seng&lt;ref name="Molest 1"/&gt;{{efn|He adopted the legal name of Zeng Guoyuan as an adult; ''Zeng'' being the non-[[romanised]] version of his surname, and ''Guoyuan'' signifying his desire to be a useful asset to Singapore ('''国'''家的资'''原''' [sic]).&lt;ref name="World Trade Centre"&gt;{{cite book|first=Guoyuan|last=Zeng|authorlink=Zeng Guo Yuan|title=Why The World Trade Centre Collapse So So Fast?|page=Introduction|publisher=Prof. Zeng Medical Centre International|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in 1953,&lt;ref name="Pet Bird 1"/&gt; the eldest son of a clerk and a homemaker. Zeng became estranged with his siblings following a dispute regarding their father's will.&lt;ref name=RiceMedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricemedia.co/the-miserable-existence-of-singapore-parrot-man/|publisher=Rice Media|title=The Miserable Existence of Singapore's Parrot Man|date=25 October 2017|last=Yeoh|first=Grace}}&lt;/ref&gt; A March 1987 ''[[The Straits Times|Straits Times]]'' report writes that Zeng's highest level of education was [[secondary school]],&lt;ref name="Piles 1"/&gt; but Zeng claims to have "a Doctor in Science degree, a Doctor in Medicine degree and a PhD in Complementary Medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=So many titles, but...|last=Lim|first=Jill|page=12|date=30 August 1996|newspaper=The New Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1977 and 1978, he was President of Dale Carnegie Alumni Association's Lion Chapter of Singapore, an oratorical society.&lt;ref name="ZengLKY"/&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Zeng was once a safety officer at a [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] production platform at [[Pulau Bukom]].&lt;ref name="Zeng Spike"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19850306-1.2.22.7 |title=Acupuncture ad spiked by health officials |date=6 March 1985 |page=8 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He officially became a member of the Singapore-based political party Workers' Party (WP) on 18 August 1991 because "the [[People's Action Party|PAP]] government obviously wants an opposition in Parliament",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=He joined WP 4 days ago|last=Ng|first=Irene|date=22 August 1991|newspaper=The New Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nutty 1"/&gt; and was fielded as a candidate for the [[Bukit Timah Single Member Constituency]] in the [[Singaporean general election, 1991|1991 Singaporean general election]].&lt;ref name="Limo 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19911207-1.2.42.3.5 |title=Zeng Guoyuan pays up for his limo |date=7 December 1991 |page=32 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] }} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He netted a quarter of the 22,000 votes cast, losing out to the PAP's Wang Kai Yuen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fined $4,000, so can't stand for GE till 1999|newspaper=The New Paper|date=13 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Singapore Elections Department|title=1991 Parliamentary Elections Results|url=http://www.eld.gov.sg/elections_past_parliamentary1991.html|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Whither PAP's Dominance?: An Analysis of Singapore's 1991 General Elections|first=Bilver|last=Singh|year=1992|page=54|isbn=9789679784183|publisher=Pelanduk Publications|location=Malaysia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeng decided to leave the party that year because, in his words, "in politics, all the crows are black".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/medical-shop-owner-contest-smc-171358458.html |title=Medical shop owner to contest in SMC? |date=22 April 2011 |last=Boey |first=Ewen |publisher=Yahoo!

===Perennial candidacy===
[[File:ZengGuoYuan2015.jpg|thumb|right|Zeng at the [[Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple]] in December 2015.]]
After leaving the Workers' Party, Zeng became a [[perennial candidate]] for election in Singapore. He ran for the Mountbatten Single Member Constituency during the [[Singaporean general election, 2006]], but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[AsiaOne]] |url=http://www.asiaone.com/print/News/Elections/Story/A1Story20110821-295506.html |date=22 August 2011 |last=Othman |first=Zul |title=They say 'Jee Say' }}&lt;/ref&gt; Believing himself to be ineligible for candidacy, Zeng decided not to take part in the [[Singaporean general election, 2011|2011 Singaporean general election]].&lt;ref name="Muslim 1"/&gt; He had been present at a nomination centre, with the relevant documents in hand, but upon being reminded of an offence he committed in 2009 he ripped them into pieces and stormed out of the venue while repeatedly underscoring that "they have fixed me up" and "you (the reporters present) know what it is all about" without any elaboration.&lt;ref name="tearpaper2011"/&gt; A news anchor at scene observed that Zeng's nomination papers had been left blank all along.&lt;ref name="tearpaper2011"/&gt;

In May 2012, Zeng announced his intention to contest the [[Singaporean by-election, 2012|2012 Singaporean by-election]], but did not complete the nomination process. Zeng alleged that he was informed that he could not contest because of an offence he had incurred four years ago – scolding two police officers with vulgarities, to which he argued it was his bird that committed the deed.&lt;ref name="Pet Bird 1"/&gt; It was later clarified in an official statement by the Singapore Elections Department that Zeng "did not file his nomination papers".&lt;ref name="Pet Bird 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20120517-346401.html |title=Zeng blames pet bird for conviction |date=17 May 2012 |last=Tong |first=Jia Han |newspaper=[[AsiaOne]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Singaporean by-election, 2013|2013 Singaporean by-election]], Zeng decided not to contest as he suspected a conspiracy against him, claiming that he first needed "the President's pardon". He also explained that he wanted to give in to candidates of higher caliber than him, adding that "[[Fools Rush In Where Angels Fear to Tread|fools rush in where angels fear to tread]]".&lt;ref name="5 Reasons"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[AsiaOne]] |url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20130116-396031.html |title=Zeng Guoyan's 5 reasons for not contesting |date=16 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, he declared that he would be [[Singaporean general election, 2015|contesting]] the [[Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency]], pledging to "fight until the end",&lt;ref name="Collect 1"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=27 August 2015|first=Min Kok|last=Lee|title=GE2015: Potential candidates show up at Elections Department to collect nomination forms|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ge2015-potential-candidates-show-up-at-election-department-to-collect-nomination-forms}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after less than a week he changed his mind, citing his being the only independent running&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=Chinese|title="選舉常客"延續慣例‧曾國原第三度退選 [Zeng Guoyuan withdraws]|url=http://news.sinchew.com.my/node/441516|date=2 September 2015|newspaper=Sinchew}}&lt;/ref&gt; his good ties with [[Chiam See Tong]] and not wanting his participation to cause a [[three-cornered-contest]] as reasons for his withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/general-election/potong-pasir-its-sitoh-versus-lina-chiam-again|title=Potong Pasir: It's Sitoh versus Lina Chiam again|date=2 September 2015|first=Yi Han|last=Lim|newspaper=AsiaOne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he revealed he could not have secured the [[Deposit (politics)#Singapore|election deposit]] alone and was relying on his "fifteen compassionate backers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel8news.sg/news8/singapore/20150901-sg-nomination/2090216.html|title=【即时报道】2015大选提名日现场情况 [Nomination Day happenings]|language=Chinese|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R. Nathan]] to endorse his healthcare products, in 2007. The act was deemed as "outrageous" by one Singaporean lawyer, who added that it may constitute [[defamation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Lianhe Wanbao]] |date=19 July 2007 |pages=22–23|title=Using photographs of politicians for commercial purposes is an offence|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof Zeng's Medical Centre folded after Zeng contracted cancer.&lt;ref name="Queen Street"/&gt;

In 2002, Zeng self-published a book on the [[September 11 attacks]], titled ''Why The World Trade Centre Collapse So So Fast?'' ([[sic]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Advertisements|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=14 October 2002|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work, which contains numerous references to the 1976 monster thriller ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'', was banned by the government upon its release.&lt;ref name="World Trade Centre"/&gt; Zeng is listed as an honorary international advisor of the Indian Board of Alternative Medicines, and is the only Singaporean panel member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary Advisors (International)|publisher=Indian Board of Alternative Medicines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media and public image===
Zeng's eccentric personality and mannerisms earned him considerable coverage in local media, and is frequently referred to as '''Parrot Man''',&lt;ref name="Collect 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cancer 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RiceMedia/&gt; a moniker that came about after Zeng blamed his pet parrot for committing a crime he was charged for.&lt;ref name="CHC2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parrot-man-zeng-guoyan-shows-up-for-city-harvest-trial|title="Parrot man" Zeng Guoyan shows up for City Harvest trial|date=15 May 2013|first=Tessa|last=Wong|newspaper=The Straits Times|quote=He gained the nickname "Parrot Man" for blaming his pet parrot for getting him arrested and charged in 2008 for using abusive language at two police officers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benson Ang stressed the controversy surrounding Zeng, describing him as "Toa Payoh's nutty professor".&lt;ref name="Nutty 1"/&gt; Tessa Wong of ''[[The Straits Times]]'' acknowledged that his appearance during elections "does add colour to what is otherwise a serious day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=AsiaOne |url=http://www.asiaone.com/print/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20130119-396576.html |date=21 January 2013 |last=Wong |first=Tessa |title=Same actors, different script }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others facetiously dub him as an "election veteran" in Singapore while noting his tendency of not filing his nomination papers and his public antics;&lt;ref name="Zeng withdraws"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailynews.sina.com/gb/news/int/sinchewdaily/20150902/19596890281.html|title=Zeng withdraws|language=Chinese|newspaper=Xinzhou Daily|date=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilsa Chan, writing for Toggle SG, billed Zeng as "the candidate who never gives up" but found his backing out of the 2015 general election bizarre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Toggle SG|first=Ilsa|last=Chan|url=http://tv.toggle.sg/zh/shows/sgvotes2015/features/ge2015-nominations-the-5602178|title=GE2015 Nominations: The good, the bad and the huh?|date=2 September 2015|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singaporean comedian and blogger Lee Kin Mun, better known as [[mrbrown]], portrayed Zeng in a satirical video on the 2013 Punggol East by-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrbrownshow.com/2013/01/16/the-mrbrown-show-punggol-east-by-election-fever/|publisher=mrbrown|first=Kin Mun|last=Lee|date=16 January 2013|accessdate=6 January 2016|title=Punggol East By-election Fever}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Zeng is notable for his unorthodox,&lt;ref name="Zeng withdraws"/&gt; Arab-style&lt;ref name="CHC2013"/&gt; clothing, often appearing in his "signature" ''[[thawb]]'', accompanied by either a red-and-white ''[[keffiyeh]]''&lt;ref name="Zeng withdraws"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK_Coz8vtKE&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Punggol East By-Election Nomination Day - (Before speech by nominated candidates)|publisher=The Online Citizen|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a golden scarf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Yahoo!|date=16 May 2012|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/houngang-by-election--nomination-day-live-blog-coverage.html|title=Hougang by-election: Straight fight between WP's Png Eng Huat and PAP's Desmond Choo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw78KoIf-xo|title=Hougang By-Election 2012: Zeng Guoyuan Not Contesting|publisher=Today|accessdate=10 January 2016|date=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An image of Zeng, outfitted in a ''[[baju kurung]]'' and ''[[songkok]]'', during the 2011 Singaporean general election is available from the photograph repository of the [[National Archives of Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/e0299e75-55d2-11e5-ac2a-0050568939ad|title=General Election 2011 - Retired acupuncturist Zeng Guoyuan|accessdate=6 January 2015|publisher=National Archives of Singapore|date=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeng is married to Lili Han Yizi ({{zh|s=韩仪子|p=Hán Yǐzi}}; born 1956),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=医师非礼女病人案法庭下午聆听陈词 (Closing remarks of case of accused doctor)|newspaper=Lianhe Wanbao|date=4 August 1988|page=5|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=针灸师非礼女书记罪名成立罚款两千 (Acupuncturist found guilty of molestation charge, fined two thousand)|newspaper=Lianhe Zaobao|language=Chinese|page=5|date=6 August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=针灸医师被控非礼女书记案 双方作了最后陈词推事庭订今天下判 (Molestation case: Final statements from both sides made, verdict to be out today)|language=Chinese|date=5 August 1988|page=5|newspaper=Lianhe Zaobao}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|She is erroneously referred to as "Han Yiyu" in a May 1989 ''[[Lianhe Zaobao]]'' report.&lt;ref name="Braves Waters"/&gt;}} and they have two sons King Yee and King Yew.&lt;ref name="Seetoh 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Straits Times|title=Dad dives to save family trapped in sinking boat|date=8 May 1989|page=28|first=Chan Teik|last=Leong}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ge.pap.org.sg/viewwu.php?rptid=205 |title=Independent candidate wants to vote for PAP |last=Davie |first=Sandra |publisher=People's Action Party Constituency Portal – Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC |accessdate=29 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Both go by the '[[Chan (surname)|Chan]]' surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Son says he peeped as dad treated|date=5 September 1996|page=7|newspaper=The New Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} A 26 March 1987 ''[[The Straits Times]]'' report on Zeng stated that his English name was Thomas.&lt;ref name="Piles 1"/&gt; In a 1996 lawsuit he was involved in, Zeng claimed to have a net worth of ten million dollars. He reportedly took "more than 10 minutes" to recite a list of his qualifications, which included "Senior Professor of the Colombo South Government Hospital" (a claim debunked by the hospital itself) and "Professor at the Medicinal Alternative Open University in the USSR and in Sri Lanka".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19960830-1.2.53.10 |title=Court hears of his 'assets of $10m and five properties' |page=46 |date=14 August 1996 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] }} {{Closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of promotional advertisements the same year, Zeng proclaimed himself to be a "Senior Professor Doctor Sir".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=biztimes19960229-1.2.15.3 |title=Advertisements |page=6 |date=29 February 1996 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] }} {{Closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes20021014-1.2.25.1 |title=Advertisements |date=14 October 2002 |page=3 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] }} {{Closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeng has attracted criticism for his unconventional behaviour. Certain acts of his in public have "annoyed" some individuals; this includes the playing of high-volume videos and Zeng's loud singing. Others opine that his acts provide some form of entertainment. Zeng reportedly is an avid boxer&lt;ref name="Nutty 1"/&gt; and a former [[taekwando]] instructor.&lt;ref name=RiceMedia/&gt; He is also interested in water sports; he owns a speed boat, in addition to ''Scat'', a [[hovercraft]] made in America.&lt;ref name="Seetoh 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Seetoh |first=K.F. |url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19890311-1.2.27.3.3 |title=Acupuncturist's new love |date=11 March 1989 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1991, Zeng was involved in an accident while on his leisure craft ''Yeeyew'', which he had purchased for $80,000 as a [[Wedding anniversary|tin jubilee]] gift for his wife.&lt;ref name="Braves Waters"&gt;{{cite news|title=针灸师潜水救妻儿 (Acupuncturist braves waters to save wife)|language=Chinese|page=1|date=8 May 1989|newspaper=Lianhe Wanbao}}&lt;/ref&gt; Items on the boat valued at tens of thousands of [[Singapore dollar|dollars]] were lost to the sea. Zeng was hospitalised for a short period following the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19890509-1.2.22.6.2 |title=Stricken boat salvaged, but family's valuables missing |date=9 May 1989 |page=13 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Zeng sustained a rib fracture and internal bleeding after a traffic collision. Zeng sued the owner of the van involved, OJJ Foods, and the matter was settled out of court in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;''Zeng Guoyuan @ Chan Hock Seng v. Ong Joo Joo Food Industries Pte Ltd'' [2014] [[State Courts of Singapore|State Courts]] (Singapore)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Zeng underwent surgery to remove his nose, due to terminal [[nasopharynx cancer]];&lt;ref name="Cancer 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/cancer-stricken-parrot-man-now-sells-tissue-paper|newspaper=The Straits Times|title=Cancer-stricken 'Parrot Man' now sells tissue paper|date=29 June 2015|first=Ronald|last=Loh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nose cancer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/messages-gifts-of-support/1730550.html |title=Messages, gifts of support continue to pour in for Mr Lee Kuan Yew |date=21 March 2015 |newspaper=[[Channel NewsAsia]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of that, the cancer [[metastasised]], and Zeng had a portion of his large intestine removed shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name="Cancer 1"/&gt; His [[thyroid]] and [[salivary]] glands were also removed for unspecified reasons.&lt;ref name=RiceMedia/&gt; Heavy in debt, he mortgaged his house in May 2015. He peddled [[tissue paper]] outside [[Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple|a Chinese temple]] at [[Queen Street, Singapore|Queen Street]]&lt;ref name="Queen Street"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Lianhe Wanbao|title=Election regular Zeng Guoyuan sells tissue paper in a wheelchair|url=http://www.wanbao.com.sg/local/story20150624-57838|language=Chinese|date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; until late 2016.

He resided with his wife at a "jumbo flat" (comprising two units) in [[Geylang Bahru]]&lt;ref name="Tussle 2017"&gt;{{cite news|first=Peiting|last=Wong|date=13 August 2017|title='Parrot Man' in tussle with Ngee Ann City management|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/parrot-man-tussle-ngee-ann-city-management|newspaper=Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; until it was destroyed by a fire in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chee Kiang|last=Tan|url=http://stomp.straitstimes.com/singapore-seen/fire-at-geylang-bahru-flat-owner-revealed-to-be-parrot-man-who-claimed-to-be-homeless|title=Fire at Geylang Bahru flat: Owner revealed to be 'Parrot Man' who claimed to be homeless|date=13 September 2017|publisher=Stomp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on the 1991 campaign trail, Zeng stated his religion as [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref name="ZengLKY"&gt;{{cite news|title=WP candidate who admires Lee Kuan Yew|date=30 August 1991|page=28|newspaper=The Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, Zeng announced that he was a [[Muslim]] and had adopted an Islamic name, Muhammad Ali.&lt;ref name="Muslim 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20110428-276030.html |title=Candidates clarify their focus |date=28 April 2011 |newspaper=[[AsiaOne]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tearpaper2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent candidate tears up papers|publisher=RazorTV|accessdate=8 January 2016|date=25 July 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1hK_ecNK_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the trial of [[Kong Hee]] was underway, Zeng endorsed him as a "good preacher" capable of "bring(ing) people to the Lord", adding that he was a Christian who had donated large amounts of money to [[City Harvest Church|City Harvest]] and attended many church sessions.&lt;ref name="GuoyanKongHee"/&gt; In addition, Zeng claimed to still be partly [[Buddhist]] and that he visited Buddhist temples on a regular basis. When asked for clarification on his religion, Zeng said:

{{quote|You can say I'm a member (of City Harvest Church), you can say (unintelligible), but I am everything. I go to the [[mosque]] – I go Monday – (and) I go to the [[Buddhist temple|temple]]; I'm still a Buddhist, if you'd say. Yes, I have a temple in [[Geylang Road|Lorong 15]].&lt;ref name="GuoyanKongHee"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3mDPL2_aaY |format=video|title="Parrot man" Zeng Guoyan leaving the Subordinate Courts |date=14 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 2017 interview, Zeng identified himself as both a Muslim and a [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]], and described the unfortunate happenings in his life as divine salvation.&lt;ref name=RiceMedia/&gt;

==Legal affairs==
In 1981, Zeng was fined $400 for an advertisement of his which was against the law. In March 1987, Zeng was found guilty of publishing a newspaper advertisement which advertised his piles and pain treatment services – a breach of the Singapore Medical Act. He was fined $1,500.&lt;ref name="Piles 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19870318.2.21.23 |title=Man fined for piles ad |date=26 March 1987 |page=26 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1988, a clerk filed a lawsuit against Zeng, attesting that he had "kissed her and touched her breast in his clinic" during a hair-loss and weight-gain treatment session in November 1986.&lt;ref name="Guoyung 1988"/&gt; Zeng countered that the accuser was merely making use of him to get her "jealous" boyfriend's attention,&lt;ref name="Guoyung 1988"/&gt; labelling the case as an "extortion bid".&lt;ref name="Extortion 1988"/&gt; He was found guilty and fined $2,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=法庭相信女病人证词 针灸师曾国原非礼罪成罚二千 (Court believes female patient, fines Zeng $2,000)|language=Chinese|date=5 August 1988|page=30|newspaper=Lianhe Wanbao}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the conviction was rescinded in March 1990, following an appeal by Zeng.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=27 March 1990|title=Acupuncturist wins appeal in molest case|page=22|newspaper=The Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1991, the owner of a white [[Mercedes-Benz]] limousine lodged a complaint against Zeng for not having paid for his vehicle, which he rented in November of that year, during the General Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Limousine squabble|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=23 November 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially refusing to pay, he later complied and no charges were filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19911207-1.2.42.3.5 |title=Zeng Guoyuan pays up for his limo |date=7 December 1991 |page=32 }} {{Closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1994, Zeng was charged with assaulting and threatening two male individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19940624-1.2.36.21.2 |title=Charged with hurting 2 men |date=24 June 1994 |page=31 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] }} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim which he initially refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19941028-1.2.37.19 |title=Workers' Party man denies punching two men |date=28 October 1994 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |page=33 }} {{Closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims were his neighbours,&lt;ref name="Fine 1"/&gt; and one of them was businessman Ho Peng Keong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19940930-1.2.35.14 |title=PC tells court: I saw businessman walk up to acupuncturist's gate |date=30 September 1994 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |page=30 }} {{Closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeng was ordered to pay a fine of [[Singapore dollar|S$]]4,000.&lt;ref name="Fine 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19941115-1.2.32.11 |title=Workers' Party man fined for hurting neighbours |date=15 November 1994 |page=24 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] }} {{Closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1996, another female patient of his claimed that Zeng had outraged her modesty at a treatment session at his acupuncture centre.&lt;ref name="Mistreat 1"/&gt; During the trial, Zeng refused to settle in court, repeatedly stating that he was a "knight of Saint John"; the claim was found to be untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19960904-1.2.29.10 |title=Accused cries in court, saying again that he was set up |date=4 September 1996 |page=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|More specifically, he alleged he had been awarded the "Order of Sovereign Military" by the "Order of Saint John of Jerusalem" in a self-promotional advert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Advertisements|page=5|date=6 January 2003|newspaper=The Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} His antics were likened by a police officer at scene to that of a "Shakespearean" actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shakespearean Drama|date=4 September 1996|page=11|newspaper=The New Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining his innocence to the end,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=After: Smacks and Shouts|page=6|date=14 September 1996|newspaper=The New Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeng was nonetheless found guilty and sentenced to four strokes of the cane and some eighteen months of jail time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19960914-1.2.5&amp;sessionid=42abe84942dc4b73a55ab7badfe40060 |date=14 September 1996 |page=1 |title=Acupuncturist guilty, gets jail and four strokes }} {{Closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that period in jail, Zeng alleged that he was stripped of some of his basic rights; he claimed that as a result of being denied access to clean bathing water, he had developed painful rashes near his [[rectum]].&lt;ref name="Mistreat 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19960829-1.2.42.13&amp;sessionid=c8e195e568e14f5491f0c2634b5ad0d4 |title=I was mistreated in police lock-up, says acupunturist |date=29 August 1996 |page=33 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the police in charge of him called him crazy and wanted to "put him in a psychiatric cell",&lt;ref name="Mistreat 1"/&gt; and also accused them of forcing him to confess through physical means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New Paper|title=I didn't step on Zeng's toe: Officer|date=6 August 1996|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, yet another similar accusation was filed against him,&lt;ref name="5 Reasons"/&gt; and he received ten strokes of the cane and twenty-seven months of imprisonment, after being deemed guilty and a failed appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zeng gets higher penalty|date=16 July 1997|newspaper=The New Paper|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Singapore Law |url=http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/free-law/high-court-judgments/14284-public-prosecutor-v-chow-yee-sze-2010-sghc-259 |title=Public Prosecutor v Chow Yee Sze [2010] SGHC 259 |accessdate=28 June 2013 |quote=Zeng Guoyuan v PP [1997] 3 SLR 321: 9 months for each of the three charges of massaging the breasts and groin of the victim in the course of an acupressure and acupuncture session; [3 strokes for each charge involving touching of breasts and groin]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeng had claimed in defence that the "nasty" victim was spitefully making up lies after he rejected her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New Paper|title=Zeng's version of molest story|date=16 July 1997|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts on his part to postpone the sentencing, on the grounds that he was mentally disabled, were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19970719-1.2.59.2.5 |date=19 July 1997 |title=So you think you are the CJ... |page=46 }} {{Closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted that Zeng's antics in court were "aggravating factor[s] that the Court could take into account in sentencing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.lawsociety.org.sg/criminallaw/index.php/unreported-cases/20-unreported-cases/54-gd-for-ma-2662012-court-8s-case |publisher=Criminal Law Portal |title=Public Prosecutor v Max Wu Guo Hao [2012] SGDC 471 |accessdate=28 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Zeng was charged with using abusive language on two police officers.&lt;ref name="Pet Bird 1"/&gt; He was found guilty of violating section 13(D) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act and fined $2,500; it was reinforced in ''Public Prosecutor v Zeng Guoyuan'' [2008] that "the tariff for using abusive/threatening language or behaviour is a fine of $3,000".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/sjc/gyh_tl_4.pdf|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]]|title=The Protection From Harassment Act 2014|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In around October 2009, a lawsuit was filed against Zeng for placing at his two stores banners of then-wanted fugitive [[Mas Selamat bin Kastari]] — which he argued were merely sunshades – without official permit.&lt;ref name="Mas Selamat 1"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[AsiaOne]] |url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/the%2BStraits%2BTimes/Story/A1Story20091013-173282.html |title=Mas Selamat banners were sunshades, says accused |last=Singh |first=Khushwant |date=13 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The banners were accompanied by large one-word notes all reading "Death".&lt;ref name="ZaobaoApril23"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zaobao.com.sg/special/report/singapore/ge/story20110423-135391|language=Chinese|newspaper=Lianhe Zaobao |title=表示有意到蒙巴登参选 曾国原：是否符合资格待当局查证 (Potential candidate Zeng doubts his own eligibility)|date=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial concluded with Zeng deciding to spend three weeks in jail, instead of paying $3,000 in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/the%2BStraits%2BTimes/Story/A1Story20091208-184546.html |date=8 December 2009 |title=Man fined $3,000 for Mas Selamat banners |newspaper=[[AsiaOne]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The management of Ngee Ann City "called the police more than 30 times"&lt;ref name="Tussle 2017"/&gt; in early 2017, alleging that Zeng was "masquerading as a cripple to sell tissue-paper packs";&lt;ref name="Tussle 2017"/&gt; Zeng countered that they were simply "not happy" and "jealous" and dismissed their allegations as "nonsense".&lt;ref name="Tussle 2017"/&gt; Additionally, a notice urging passers-by not to donate to Zeng was put up by the mall. Zeng was charged with begging, using abusive language on a police officer, and assaulting a Ngee Ann City security officer.&lt;ref name="Tussle 2017"/&gt; Around End July 2018, Zeng returned to Orchard Road to peddle tissue at the crossing infront of Mandarin Hotel, a video of him was uploaded online and went viral. The video cited that he was causing nuisance and faking as a handicap, and also warned passersby not to believe his rouse. In August 2018, Zeng was arrested for disorderly behaviour in Orchard Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/parrot-man-zeng-guoyuan-arrested-for-disorderly-behaviour-in-orchard-road?|newspaper=The Straits Times|title=Parrot Man Zeng Guoyuan arrested for disorderly behaviour in Orchard Road|last=Goh|first=Timothy|date=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, he was arrested in [[Geylang Serai]] for assaulting two police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parrot-man-arrested-in-geylang-serai-after-hurting-two-police-officers|title='Parrot Man' arrested in Geylang Serai after hurting two police officers|last=Goh|first=Timothy|date=15 October 2018|newspaper=The Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018, former senior staff sergeant Seah Chin Peng was charged in a district court for deliberately damaging Zeng's walking stick two years ago and attempting to suppress the truth behind its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/police-officer-charged-for-damaging-parrot-mans-walking-stick-and-then-lying|newspaper=The Straits Times|title=Police officer accused of damaging 'Parrot Man's' walking stick and then lying about it|last=Alkhatib|first=Sharib|date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
