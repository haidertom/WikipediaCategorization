The '''Aarne–Thompson classification systems''' are indices used to classify [[Folklore|folktales]]: the [[Antti Aarne|Aarne]]–[[Stith Thompson|Thompson]] Motif-Index (catalogued by alphabetical letters followed by numerals), the Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index (cataloged by AT or AaTh numbers), and the '''Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification system''' (developed in 2004 and cataloged by ATU numbers). 

They are named after their authors, [[Antti Aarne]], [[Stith Thompson]], and [[Hans-Jörg Uther]].

The indices are used in [[folkloristics]] to organize, classify, and analyze [[folklore]] narratives and are essential tools for folklorists, as [[Alan Dundes]] explained in 1997 about the first two indices, "the identification of folk narratives through [[Motif (folkloristics)|motif]] and/or tale type numbers has become an international ''[[sine qua non]]'' among bona fide folklorists".&lt;ref name="dundes"&gt;Dundes, Alan (1997) "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3814885 The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique]". ''Journal of Folklore Research'' Vol. 34, No. 3, pp. 195–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizing folktale types==
The Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index divides tales into sections with an AT number for each entry. The names given are typical, but usage varies; the same tale type number may be referred to by its central motif or by one of the variant folktales of that type, which can also vary, especially when used in different countries and cultures. The tale type does not have to be accurate for every folktale. For example, ''The Cat as Helper'' (545B) also includes tales where a fox helps the hero. Closely related folktales are often grouped within a type. For example, tale types 400–424 all feature brides or wives as the primary protagonist, for instance ''The Quest for a Lost Bride'' (400) or the ''Animal Bride'' (402). Subtypes within a tale type are designated by the addition of a letter to the AT number, for instance: the ''Persecuted Heroine'' (510) has subtypes 510A, ''[[Cinderella]]'', and 510B, ''[[Catskin]]'' {{crossref|printworthy=y|1=(see other examples of tale types in the [[#Online resources and examples of tale types|online resource links]] at the end of this article)}}.

[[Antti Aarne]] was a student of [[Julius Krohn]] and his son [[Kaarle Krohn]]. Aarne developed their [[historic-geographic method]] of comparative folkloristics, and developed the initial version of what became the Aarne–Thompson tale type index for [[Morphology (folkloristics)|classifying folktales]], first published in 1910.

The American folklorist [[Stith Thompson]] translated Aarne's [[motif (folkloristics)|motif-based]] classification system in 1928, enlarging its scope. With Thompson's second revisions to Aarne's catalogue in 1961, he created the "AT number system" (also referred to as "AaTh system"), which is often used today, more commonly in its updated "ATU number" form. According to [[D. L. Ashliman]], "The Aarne–Thompson system catalogues some 2500 basic plots from which, for countless generations, European and Near Eastern storytellers have built their tales".&lt;ref name=ashliman&gt;[[D. L. Ashliman|Ashliman, D. L.]] 1987. ''A Guide to Folktales in the English Language: Based on the Aarne–Thompson Classification System.'' New York, Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AT-number system was updated and expanded in 2004 with the publication of ''The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography'' by Hans-Jörg Uther. Uther noted that many of the earlier descriptions were cursory and often imprecise, that many "irregular types" are in fact old and widespread, and that "emphasis on oral tradition" often obscured "older, written versions of the tale types".&lt;ref name="uther"/&gt; To remedy these shortcomings Uther developed the '''Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification''' (ATU) system&lt;ref&gt;''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales'', Donald Haase, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; and included more tales from eastern and southern Europe as well as "smaller narrative forms" in this expanded listing.&lt;ref name="uther"/&gt;

==Organising motifs==
{{main|Motif-Index of Folk-Literature}}
The Aarne–Thompson ''[[Motif-Index of Folk-Literature]]'' organizes thousands of motifs into a similar system. Entries are first organized by an umbrella topic (for example, category S is "Unnatural Cruelty"). Entries are then divided into more specific subcategories. For example, entry S50 "Cruel relatives-in-law", under which is the more specific entry S51.1 "Cruel mother-in-law plans death of daughter-in-law".

==Critical response==
In his essay "The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique", Alan Dundes explains that the Aarne–Thompson indexes are some of the "most valuable tools in the professional folklorist's arsenal of aids for analysis".&lt;ref name=dundes/&gt;

The tale type index was criticized by [[Vladimir Propp]] of the [[Russian Formalism|Formalist]] school of the 1920s for ignoring the {{em|functions}} of the [[Motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] by which they are classified. Furthermore, Propp contended that using a "macro-level" analysis means that the stories that share [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] might not be classified together, while stories with wide divergences may be grouped under one tale type because the index must select some features as salient.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folktale''. Similarly, [[Alan Dundes]] points out that "Aarne’s mistake was not classifying tales on the basis of narrative plot rather than [on characters]" because "the same tale can be told with either animal or human characters" (197). "Introduction." Theory and History of Folklore. Ed. Anatoly Liberman. University of Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press, 1984. pg ix&lt;/ref&gt;  He also observed that while the distinction between animal tales and tales of the fantastic was basically correct—no one would classify [[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]] an animal tale because of the wolf—it did raise questions because animal tales often contained fantastic elements, and tales of the fantastic often contained animals; indeed a tale could shift categories if a peasant deceived a bear rather than a devil.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, ''Morphology of the Folktale'', p. 5 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing the motivation for his work,&lt;ref name="uther"&gt;{{cite web |first=Hans-Jörg |last=Uther |url=http://www.folklorefellows.fi/?page_id=915 |title=Classifying folktales: The Third Revision of the Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index (FFC 184) |publisher=folklorefellow.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uther presents several criticisms of the original index. He points out that Thompson's focus on oral tradition sometimes neglects older versions of stories, even when written records exist, that the distribution of stories is uneven (with Eastern and Southern European as well as many other regions' folktale types being under-represented), and that some included folktale types have dubious importance. Similarly, Thompson had noted that the tale type index might well be called ''The Types of the Folk-Tales of Europe, West Asia, and the Lands Settled by these Peoples''.&lt;ref name="uther"/&gt; However, Alan Dundes notes that in spite of the flaws of tale type indexes (e.&amp;nbsp;g., typos, redundancies, censorship, etc.; p.&amp;nbsp;198),&lt;ref name="dundes" /&gt; "they represent the keystones for the comparative method in [[folkloristics]], a method which despite postmodern naysayers ... continues to be the hallmark of international folkloristics" (p.&amp;nbsp;200).&lt;ref name="dundes" /&gt;

==Use in folkloristics==

A [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] study, published by [[folklorist]] Sara Graça da Silva and [[anthropologist]] Jamshid J. Tehrani in 2016, tried to evaluate the time of emergence for the "Tales of Magic" (ATU 300–ATU 749), based on a [[phylogenetic]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graça da Silva |first=Sara |last2=Tehrani  |first2=Jamshid J. |date=January 2016 |title=Comparative phylogenetic analyses uncover the ancient roots of Indo-European folktales |url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/1/150645#F4 |journal=Royal Society Open Science |publisher=The Royal Society |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1098/rsos.150645 |access-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found four of them to belong to the [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) stratum of magic tales, namely:

* ATU 328 ''The Boy Steals Ogre's Treasure'',
* ATU 330 ''[[The Smith and the Devil]]'' (= [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|KHM]] 81a),
* ATU 402 ''The Animal Bride'' (= KHM [[:de:Die drei Federn|63]] and [[:de:Der arme Müllerbursch und das Kätzchen|106]]), and
* ATU 554 ''The Grateful Animals'' (= ''[[The White Snake]]'', KHM 17, and ''[[The Queen Bee]]'', KHM 62).

Ten more magic tales were found to be current throughout the Western branch of the Indo-European languages, comprising the main European language families derived from PIE (i.&amp;nbsp;e. [[Balto-Slavic]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Italo-Celtic]]):

* ATU 311 ''Rescue by Sister'' (= ''[[Fitcher's Bird]]'', KHM 46),
* ATU 332 ''[[Godfather Death]]'' (= KHM 44),
* ATU 425&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'',
* ATU 470 ''Friends in Life and Death'',
* ATU 500 ''The Name of the Supernatural Helper'' (= ''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]'', KHM 55),
* ATU 505 ''The Grateful Dead'',
* ATU 531 ''The Clever Horse'' (= ''[[Ferdinand the Faithful and Ferdinand the Unfaithful]]'', KHM 126),
* ATU 592 ''The Dance among Thorns'' (= ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Der Jude im Dorn|Der Jude im Dorn]]}}'', KHM 110 is an example of this type of tale, and one of many racist and antisemitic folk tales that have been recorded),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maarten Janssen |url=http://www.mftd.org/index.php?action=atu&amp;act=select&amp;atu=592 |title=Multilingual Folk Tale Database |publisher=Mftd.org |date= |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**The original version of the "Dance Among the Thorns" tale-type comes from 15th century Europe, and features a monk who was forced to dance in a thorn bush, by a boy with a magic flute or fiddle. It reflected the anticlerical sentiment of many folk tales at the time, and implies that the monk deserves this punishment. An American version of this tale, told to folklorist  Marie Campbell in 1958 in Kentucky, included this apology from the informant: "Seems like all the tales about Jews gives the Jews a bad name — greedy, grabbing for cash money, cheating their work hands out of their wages — I don't know what all. I never did know a Jew, never even met up with one." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9KEk9wQPjkC&amp;pg=PA786&amp;lpg=PA786&amp;dq=ATU+592&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TdDjHA6OZI&amp;sig=BPMc1SNTkK7wUuyJsQCm4lAS2mQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCzfe_4IXcAhVKzVMKHR5EBLMQ6AEIPzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=ATU%20592&amp;f=false |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales [3 Volumes&amp;#93; - Donald Haase - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-12-30 |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ATU 650&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; ''Strong John'' (= ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Der starke Hans|Der starke Hans]]}}'', KHM 166), and
* ATU 675 ''The Lazy Boy''.

'''Adi''' ([[Skt.]], 'first') is a Hindu, Buddhist, and Theosophical term meaning the first part of reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], ''A Textbook of Theosophy'', Madras, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; It has to do with the [[first cause]] or even [[causeless cause|Adi-Ananta]]—at least as unity of infinity (as Plotinus and others say) emanating the first finite one.  This is called [[Brahman#Semantics and pronunciation|Brahm]] (in Hinduism) and [[Adi-Buddha]], and Theosophy also says it has to do with the [[divinity|Divine]] [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]], e.g. [[Logos]].

'''Admiration''' is a social emotion elicited by people of competence, talent, or skill exceeding standards.&lt;ref name="Algoe"&gt;Algoe, S. B., &amp; Haidt, J. (2009). Witnessing excellence in action: The ‘other-praising’emotions of elevation, gratitude, and admiration. The journal of positive psychology, 4(2), 105–127.&lt;/ref&gt; Admiration facilitates social learning in groups&lt;ref name = "Haidt"&gt;Haidt, J., &amp; Seder, P. (2009). Admiration and Awe. Oxford Companion to Affective Science (pp. 4–5). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and motivates self-improvement through learning from role-models.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, R. H. (2000). Assimilative and contrastive emotional reactions to upward and downward social comparisons. Handbook of social comparison: Theory and research, 173–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Sara Algoe and [[Jonathan Haidt]]&lt;ref name="Algoe" /&gt; include admiration in the category of other-praising [[emotions]], alongside [[awe]], elevation, and [[gratitude]]. They propose that admiration is the emotion we feel towards non-moral excellence (i.e., witnessing an act of excellent skill), while elevation is the emotion we feel towards moral excellence (i.e., witnessing someone perform an act of exceeding virtue). Other authors term both these emotions as ''admiration'', distinguishing between ''admiration for skill'' and ''admiration for virtue''.&lt;ref name = "fmri"&gt;Immordino-Yang, M. H., McColl, A., Damasio, H., &amp; Damasio, A. (2009). Neural correlates of admiration and compassion. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 106(19), 8021.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Smith&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; categorises admiration as an other-focused assimilative emotion, leading people to aspire to be like (assimilate to) those they admire. He contrasts admiration with [[envy]] (an other-focused contrastive emotion), proposing that envy leads us to feel frustrated about the competence of others, while admiration is uplifting and motivating.

==Function==

Learning of skills has been so important to our evolution that we have come to feel positively about talented or skillful people, in order to approach them and copy their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Henrich, J., &amp; Gil-White, F. J. (2001). The evolution of prestige: Freely conferred deference as a mechanism for enhancing the benefits of cultural transmission. Evolution and human behavior, 22(3), 165–196.&lt;/ref&gt; Admiration is the emotion that facilitates learning in social groups.&lt;ref name = "Haidt" /&gt;

==Relation to attainability==

Following from the view that admiration's function is learning and self-improvement,&lt;ref name = "Haidt" /&gt; some authors have proposed that admiration will only activate when we believe improvement is possible for us,&lt;ref name = "Algoe" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Smith" /&gt; however one empirical study has suggested the opposite, that admiration is akin to passive contemplation of an other's superiority, while envy is the motivating emotion which activates when a better performance is attainable to us.&lt;ref&gt;Van De Ven, N., Zeelenberg, M., &amp; Pieters, R. (2011). Why Envy Outperforms Admiration. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 37(6), 784–795.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated behaviours==

===Behaviours concerning the self===
Witnessing admirable acts has been shown to increase motivation for self-improvement in the domain of witnessed excellence (e.g., sporting performance), but also a more general motivation to work towards achieving one's own life goals.&lt;ref name="Algoe" /&gt; Using [[fMRI]], admiration has been shown to be related with higher-level cognitive processes involved in motivation (e.g., planning, pursuit of goals), but also relates to lower-level activating mechanisms, demonstrating that admiration is a physically energising emotion.&lt;ref name = "fmri" /&gt;

===Behaviours concerning the relationship===
Admiration is also associated with a tendency to praise the admired act to others,&lt;ref name ="Algoe" /&gt; and a desire for contact and proximity with the admired.&lt;ref name = "Cuddy"&gt;Cuddy, A. J. ., Fiske, S. T., &amp; Glick, P. (2007). The BIAS map: Behaviors from intergroup affect and stereotypes. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 92(4), 631.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group-based==
Admiration has also been studied in an intergroup context by [[Susan Fiske]] and her colleagues. They propose that admiration is the emotion we feel towards those social groups we perceive as competent (or high-status) and warm (friendly and cooperative) (e.g., in studies involving students in the US, an example of a group perceived as competent and warm is ''the British'').&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, S. T., Cuddy, A. J. C., Glick, P., &amp; Xu, J. (2002). A model of (often mixed) stereotype content: Competence and warmth respectively follow from perceived status and competition. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 82(6), 878–902.&lt;/ref&gt; Admiration is related to intentions to associate, cooperate with, and help members from groups that are admired.&lt;ref name = "Cuddy" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="843">'''The Apology Project''', a 1980 conceptual art project, was created by [[Allan Bridge]] who employed the pseudonym Mr. Apology. Bridge used an [[answering machine]] to record confessions from anonymous callers. More than 1000 hours of confession were recorded, ranging from common confessions to ritualistic murders.

Some of the confessions were published in Bridge's magazine ''Apology''.

This Apology Project is not to be confused with the Apology Project of Elliniko Teatro, a theatrical production based on Plato's The Apology of Socrates, featuring Yannis Simonides (see http://www.ellinikotheatro.org.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6380">Being '''bedridden''' is a form of immobility that can present as the inability to move or even sit upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bedridden|title=Definition of BEDRIDDEN|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from bed-rest, a form of non-invasive treatment that is usually part of recovery or the limitation of activities. Some of the more serious consequences of being bedridden is the high risk of developing [[Thrombosis prevention|thrombosis]] and [[Muscle atrophy|muscle wasting]] (atrophy). Its meaning is derived from a middle English term (bedrid) from a 1300s past tense form of riding a bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bedridden|title=The definition of bedridden|last=|first=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complications ==
Being bedridden leads to many complications such as loss of muscle strength and endurance. Contractures, osteoporosis from disuse and the degeneration of joints can occur. Being confined to bed can add to the likelihood of developing an increased heart rate, decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and thromboembolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maclin|first=V.

Falling from a bed can result in injury.

== Prevention ==
One recommendation for preventing the complications of being bedridden is to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet that contains enough calories and protein needed for optimum health. If someone is confined to bed changing position at least every two hours can help prevent complications in addition to change sheeting and bedclothes immediately if they are soiled, and using items that can help reduce pressure, such as pillows or foam padding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Studies ==
One [[India]]n study of care given to bedridden individuals at home found that family members made up 82% of [[caregivers]]. A high rate of [[Complication (medicine)|medical complications]] was reported, including [[pressure ulcers]] and [[urinary tract infection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of home-based caregivers of bedridden patients in North India|url=http://ijcm.org.in/article.asp?issn=0970-0218;year=2011;volume=36;issue=2;spage=114;epage=119;aulast=Bains|author=Puneet Bains|author2=Amarjeet Singh Minhas|publisher=[[Indian Journal of Community Medicine]]|date=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3265">'''Behavioral contrast''' refers to a change in the strength of one [[Stimulus (psychology)|response]] that occurs when the rate of [[Reward system|reward]] of a second response, or of the first response under different conditions, is changed. For example, suppose that a [[pigeon]] in an [[Operant conditioning chamber|operant chamber]] pecks a key for food reward. Sometimes the key is red, sometimes green, but food comes with equal frequency in either case. Then suddenly pecking the key when it is green brings food less frequently. Positive contrast is seen when the rate of response to the red key goes up, even though the frequency of reward in red remains unchanged. Likewise, increasing the reward to green tends to reduce the response rate to red (negative contrast). This sort of contrast effect may occur following changes in the amount, frequency, or nature of the reward, and it has been shown to occur with various experimental designs and response measures (e.g. response rate, running speed).&lt;ref name = Mackintosh&gt;Mackintosh, N. J. (1974) The Psychology of Animal Learning. New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catania, A. C.(1992)  Learning. Englewood Cliffs NJ: Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of contrast effects==
In 1942, Crespi measured the speed of [[rat]]s running to various amounts of reward at the end of an alley. He found that the greater the magnitude of reward, the faster the rat would run to get the reward.&lt;ref&gt;Crespi, Leo P. (1942). Quantitative variation of incentive and performance in the white rat. ''American Journal of Psychology, 55,'' 467-517&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of his experiment Crespi shifted some of his animals from a large reward to a small reward. These animals now ran even more slowly than control animals that had been trained on small reward throughout the experiment. This [[Overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] is an example of successive negative contrast. Likewise, other animals shifted from small to large reward ran faster than those trained on the larger reward throughout (successive positive contrast). Crespi originally called these effects ''depression'' and ''elation'' respectively, but, in 1949, Zeaman suggested changing the names to ''negative contrast'' and ''positive contrast''.&lt;ref&gt;Zeaman, D. (1949). Response latency as a function of the amount of reinforcement. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology, 39,'' 466-483&lt;/ref&gt; The combined concept of behavioral contrast is sometimes also referred to as the [[Crespi effect|Crespi Effect]]. 

In 1981, Bower discovered that positive contrast may be reduced because the response measure hits a ceiling. Thus, if contrast is the subject of an experiment, reward sizes may need to be adjusted to keep the response below such a ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;Bower, G. H., &amp; Hilgard, E.R. (1980). ''Theories of Learning'' (5th ed.) Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Flaherty suggested that negative contrast was related to frustration; that is, the sudden shift to a low reward causes frustration for the person or the animal, and this frustration interferes with the behavior the subject is performing.&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, C.F. ''Incentive Relativity'' New York, NY: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5103">[[File:Bipolar cylindrical coordinates.png|thumb|350px|right|[[Coordinate system#Coordinate surface|Coordinate surfaces]] of the bipolar cylindrical coordinates.  The yellow crescent corresponds to σ, whereas the red tube corresponds to τ and the blue plane corresponds to ''z''=1.  The three surfaces intersect at the point '''P''' (shown as a black sphere).]]

'''Bipolar cylindrical coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from projecting the two-dimensional [[bipolar coordinates|bipolar coordinate system]] in the
perpendicular &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-direction.  The two lines of [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] 
&lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; of the projected [[Apollonian circles]] are generally taken to be 
defined by &lt;math&gt;x=-a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=+a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, (and by &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt;) in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

The term "bipolar" is often used to describe other curves having two singular points (foci), such as [[ellipse]]s, [[hyperbola]]s, and [[Cassini oval]]s.  However, the term ''bipolar coordinates'' is never used to describe coordinates associated with those curves, e.g., [[elliptic coordinates]].

==Basic definition==

The most common definition of bipolar cylindrical coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, z)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \ \frac{\sinh \tau}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \ \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = \ z
&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; coordinate of a point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
equals the angle &lt;math&gt;F_{1} P F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the 
&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; coordinate equals the [[natural logarithm]] of the ratio of the distances &lt;math&gt;d_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; to the focal lines

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau = \ln \frac{d_{1}}{d_{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

(Recall that the focal lines &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are located at &lt;math&gt;x=-a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=+a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.) 

Surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; correspond to cylinders of different radii

:&lt;math&gt;
x^{2} +
\left( y - a \cot \sigma \right)^{2} = \frac{a^{2}}{\sin^{2} \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

that all pass through the focal lines and are not concentric.  The surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are non-intersecting cylinders of different radii

:&lt;math&gt;
y^{2} +
\left( x - a \coth \tau \right)^{2} = \frac{a^{2}}{\sinh^{2} \tau}
&lt;/math&gt;

that surround the focal lines but again are not concentric.  The focal lines and all these cylinders are parallel to the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis (the direction of projection).  In the &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt; plane, the centers of the constant-&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and constant-&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; cylinders lie on the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axes, respectively.
 
==Scale factors==

The scale factors for the bipolar coordinates &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\sigma} = h_{\tau} = \frac{a}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the remaining scale factor &lt;math&gt;h_{z}=1&lt;/math&gt;.  
Thus, the infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = \frac{a^{2}}{\left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^{2}} d\sigma d\tau dz
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian is given by 

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla^{2} \Phi =
\frac{1}{a^{2}} \left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^{2}
\left( 
\frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \sigma^{2}} + 
\frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial \tau^{2}} 
\right) + 
\frac{\partial^{2} \Phi}{\partial z^{2}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; 
and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting 
the scale factors into the general formulae 
found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Applications==
The classic applications of bipolar coordinates are in solving [[partial differential equations]], 
e.g., [[Laplace's equation]] or the [[Helmholtz equation]], for which bipolar coordinates allow a 
[[separation of variables]] (in 2D).  A typical example would be the [[electric field]] surrounding two 
parallel cylindrical conductors.

'''Chaos theory''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] focusing on the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s that are highly sensitive to [[initial conditions]]. "Chaos" is an interdisciplinary theory stating that within the apparent randomness of [[chaotic complex system]]s, there are underlying patterns, constant [[feedback loops]], repetition, [[self-similarity]], [[fractals]], [[self-organization]], and reliance on programming at the initial point known as ''sensitive dependence on initial conditions''. The [[butterfly effect]] describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state, e.g. a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a hurricane in Texas.&lt;ref name="bo1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://geoffboeing.com/2015/03/chaos-theory-logistic-map/ |author = Boeing |title = Chaos Theory and the Logistic Map |date = 2015 |accessdate = 2015-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small differences in initial conditions, such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation, yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Kellert |first = Stephen H. |title = In the Wake of Chaos: Unpredictable Order in Dynamical Systems |publisher = University of Chicago Press |year = 1993 |isbn = 978-0-226-42976-2 |page = 32 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens even though these systems are [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]], meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no [[randomness|random]] elements involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WerndlCharlotte"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Werndl, Charlotte |title = What are the New Implications of Chaos for Unpredictability? |journal = The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume = 60 |issue = 1 |pages = 195–220 |year = 2009 |url = http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/60/1/195 |doi = 10.1093/bjps/axn053 |arxiv = 1310.1576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is known as '''deterministic chaos''', or simply '''chaos'''.

==Introduction==
Chaos theory concerns deterministic systems whose behavior can in principle be predicted. Chaotic systems are predictable for a while and then 'appear' to become random.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; The amount of time that the behavior of a chaotic system can be effectively predicted depends on three things: How much uncertainty can be tolerated in the forecast, how accurately its current state can be measured, and a time scale depending on the dynamics of the system, called the [[Lyapunov time]]. Some examples of Lyapunov times are: chaotic electrical circuits, about 1 millisecond; weather systems, a few  days (unproven); the solar system, 50 million years. In chaotic systems, the uncertainty in a forecast increases [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] with elapsed time. Hence, mathematically, doubling the forecast time more than squares the proportional uncertainty in the forecast. This means, in practice, a meaningful prediction cannot be made over an interval of more than two or three times the Lyapunov time. When meaningful predictions cannot be made, the system appears random.&lt;ref&gt;''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Steven Strogatz, Hyperion, New York, 2003, pages 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, "chaos" means "a state of disorder".&lt;ref&gt;Definition of {{linktext|chaos}} at [[Wiktionary]];&lt;/ref&gt; However, in chaos theory, the term is defined more precisely. Although no universally accepted mathematical definition of chaos exists, a commonly used definition originally formulated by [[Robert L. Devaney]] says that, to classify a dynamical system as chaotic, it must have these properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A First Course in Dynamics: With a Panorama of Recent Developments|last=Hasselblatt|first=Boris|author2=Anatole Katok|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58750-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# it must be sensitive to initial conditions
# it must be [[topological mixing|topologically mixing]]
# it must have [[dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbit]]s

In some cases, the last two properties in the above have been shown to actually imply sensitivity to initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-58488-002-8 |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Basener, William F. |title=Topology and its applications |publisher=Wiley |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-471-68755-9 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, while it is often the most practically significant property, "sensitivity to initial conditions" need not be stated in the definition.

If attention is restricted to [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]], the second property implies the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vellekoop, Michel |author2=Berglund, Raoul |title=On Intervals, Transitivity = Chaos |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=353–5 |date=April 1994 |jstor=2975629 |doi=10.2307/2975629}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative, and in general weaker, definition of chaos uses only the first two properties in the above list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Medio, Alfredo |author2=Lines, Marji |title=Nonlinear Dynamics: A Primer |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-521-55874-7 |page=165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chaos as a spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry ===
{{Main|Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics}}In continuous time dynamical systems, chaos is the phenomenon of the spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry which is an intrinsic property of evolution operators of all stochastic and deterministic (partial) differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 2016|title=Introduction to Supersymmetric Theory of Stochastics|journal=Entropy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=108|doi=10.3390/e18040108|author=Ovchinnikov, I.V.|arxiv = 1511.03393 |bibcode = 2016Entrp..18..108O }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Topological supersymmetry breaking: Definition and stochastic generalization of chaos and the limit of applicability of statistics|journal=Modern Physics Letters B|volume=30|issue=8|pages=1650086|doi=10.1142/S021798491650086X|author1=Ovchinnikov, I.V.|author2=Schwartz, R. N.|author3=Wang, K. L.|bibcode = 2016MPLB...3050086O |arxiv=1404.4076}}&lt;/ref&gt; This picture of dynamical chaos works not only for deterministic models but also for models with external noise, which is an important generalization from the physical point of view because in reality all dynamical systems experience influence from their stochastic environments. Within this picture, the long-range dynamical behavior associated with chaotic dynamics, e.g., the [[butterfly effect]], is a consequence of the [[Goldstone's theorem]] in the application to the spontaneous topological supersymmetry breaking.

===Sensitivity to initial conditions===
{{Main|Butterfly effect}}
[[File:SensInitCond.gif|thumb|Lorenz equations used to generate plots for the y variable. The initial conditions for ''x'' and ''z'' were kept the same but those for ''y'' were changed between '''1.001''', '''1.0001''' and '''1.00001'''. The values for &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; were '''45.92''', '''16''' and '''4 ''' respectively. As can be seen, even the slightest difference in initial values causes significant changes after about 12 seconds of evolution in the three cases. This is an example of sensitive dependence on initial conditions.]]
'''Sensitivity to initial conditions''' means that each point in a chaotic system is arbitrarily closely approximated by other points with significantly different future paths, or trajectories. Thus, an arbitrarily small change, or perturbation, of the current trajectory may lead to significantly different future behavior.

Sensitivity to initial conditions is popularly known as the "[[butterfly effect]]", so-called because of the title of a paper given by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1972 to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Washington, D.C., entitled ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?''. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events that prevents the predictability of large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the overall system would have been vastly different.

A consequence of sensitivity to initial conditions is that if we start with a limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most prevalent in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead.&lt;ref name="RGW"&gt;{{cite book |author=Watts, Robert G. |title=Global Warming and the Future of the Earth |publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool |year=2007 |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this does not mean that we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100&amp;nbsp;°C or fall to −130&amp;nbsp;°C on earth (during the current [[geologic era]]), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.

In more mathematical terms, the [[Lyapunov exponent]] measures the sensitivity to initial conditions. Given two starting [[trajectory|trajectories]] in the [[phase space]] that are infinitesimally close, with initial separation &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf{Z}_0&lt;/math&gt;, the two trajectories end up diverging at a rate given by

:&lt;math&gt; | \delta\mathbf{Z}(t) | \approx e^{\lambda t} | \delta \mathbf{Z}_0 |,&lt;/math&gt;

where t is the time and λ is the Lyapunov exponent. The rate of separation depends on the orientation of the initial separation vector, so a whole spectrum of Lyapunov exponents exist. The number of Lyapunov exponents is equal to the number of dimensions of the phase space, though it is common to just refer to the largest one. For example, the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE) is most often used because it determines the overall predictability of the system. A positive MLE is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic.

Also, other properties relate to sensitivity of initial conditions, such as [[Measure (mathematics)|measure-theoretical]] [[Mixing (mathematics)|mixing]] (as discussed in [[ergodicity|ergodic]] theory) and properties of a [[Kolmogorov automorphism|K-system]].&lt;ref name="WerndlCharlotte" /&gt;

===Topological mixing===
[[File:LogisticTopMixing1-6.gif|thumb|Six iterations of a set of states &lt;math&gt;[x,y]&lt;/math&gt;  passed through the logistic map. (a) the blue plot (legend 1) shows the first iterate (initial condition), which essentially forms a circle. Animation shows the first to the sixth iteration of the circular initial conditions. It can be seen that ''mixing'' occurs as we progress in iterations. The sixth iteration shows that the points are almost completely scattered in the phase space. Had we progressed further in iterations, the mixing would have been homogeneous and irreversible. The logistic map has equation &lt;math&gt;x_{k+1} = 4  x_k  (1 - x_k )&lt;/math&gt;. To expand the state-space of the logistic map into two dimensions,  a second state, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, was created as &lt;math&gt;y_{k+1} = x_k + y_k &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x_k + y_k &lt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_{k+1} = x_k + y_k -1&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.]]
[[File:Chaos Topological Mixing.png|thumb|The map defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''y'' → (''x'' + ''y)'' [[Modulo operation|mod]] 1&lt;/span&gt; also displays [[topological mixing]]. Here, the blue region is transformed by the dynamics first to the purple region, then to the pink and red regions, and eventually to a cloud of vertical lines scattered across the space.]]

'''[[Topological mixing]]''' (or '''topological transitivity''') means that the system evolves over time so that any given region or [[open set]] of its [[phase space]] eventually overlaps with any other given region. This mathematical concept of "mixing" corresponds to the standard intuition, and the mixing of colored [[dye]]s or fluids is an example of a chaotic system.

Topological mixing is often omitted from popular accounts of chaos, which equate chaos with only sensitivity to initial conditions. However, sensitive dependence on initial conditions alone does not give chaos. For example, consider the simple dynamical system produced by repeatedly doubling an initial value. This system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions everywhere, since any pair of nearby points eventually becomes widely separated. However, this example has no topological mixing, and therefore has no chaos. Indeed, it has extremely simple behavior: all points except 0 tend to positive or negative infinity.

===Density of periodic orbits===
For a chaotic system to have [[Dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]] means that every point in the space is approached arbitrarily closely by periodic orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devaney|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')&lt;/span&gt; is one of the simplest systems with density of periodic orbits.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5+\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt; (or approximately 0.3454915&amp;nbsp;→ 0.9045085&amp;nbsp;→ 0.3454915) is an (unstable) orbit of period 2, and similar orbits exist for periods 4, 8, 16, etc. (indeed, for all the periods specified by [[Sharkovskii's theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alligood|Sauer|Yorke|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharkovskii's theorem is the basis of the Li and Yorke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li |first1=T.Y. |last2=Yorke |first2=J.A. |title=Period Three Implies Chaos |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=82 |pages=985–92 |year=1975 |url=http://pb.math.univ.gda.pl/chaos/pdf/li-yorke.pdf |format=PDF |author-link=Tien-Yien Li |doi=10.2307/2318254 |issue=10 |author2-link=James A. Yorke |bibcode=1975AmMM...82..985L |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229042210/http://pb.math.univ.gda.pl/chaos/pdf/li-yorke.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1975) proof that any continuous one-dimensional system that exhibits a regular cycle of period three will also display regular cycles of every other length, as well as completely chaotic orbits.

===Strange attractors===
[[File:TwoLorenzOrbits.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] displays chaotic behavior.  These two plots demonstrate sensitive dependence on initial conditions within the region of phase space occupied by the attractor.]]
Some dynamical systems, like the one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x''),&lt;/span&gt; are chaotic everywhere, but in many cases chaotic behavior is found only in a subset of phase space. The cases of most interest arise when the chaotic behavior takes place on an [[attractor]], since then a large set of initial conditions leads to orbits that converge to this chaotic region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strelioff|first1=Christopher|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Medium-Term Prediction of Chaos|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|date=2006|volume=96|issue=4|pages=044101|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.044101|pmid=16486826|bibcode = 2006PhRvL..96d4101S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An easy way to visualize a chaotic attractor is to start with a point in the [[basin of attraction]] of the attractor, and then simply plot its subsequent orbit. Because of the topological transitivity condition, this is likely to produce a picture of the entire final attractor, and indeed both orbits shown in the figure on the right give a picture of the general shape of the Lorenz attractor.  This attractor results from a simple three-dimensional model of the [[Edward Lorenz|Lorenz]] weather system. The Lorenz attractor is perhaps one of the best-known chaotic system diagrams, probably because it was not only one of the first, but it is also one of the most complex and as such gives rise to a very interesting pattern that, with a little imagination, looks like the wings of a butterfly.

Unlike [[Attractor#Fixed point|fixed-point attractors]] and [[limit cycle]]s, the attractors that arise from chaotic systems, known as [[strange attractor]]s, have great detail and complexity.  Strange attractors occur in both [[continuous function|continuous]] dynamical systems (such as the Lorenz system) and in some [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] systems (such as the [[Hénon map]]). Other discrete dynamical systems have a repelling structure called a [[Julia set]], which forms at the boundary between basins of attraction of fixed points. Julia sets can be thought of as strange repellers. Both strange attractors and Julia sets typically have a [[fractal]] structure, and the [[fractal dimension]] can be calculated for them.

===Minimum complexity of a chaotic system===
[[File:LogisticMap BifurcationDiagram.png|thumb|right|[[Bifurcation diagram]] of the [[logistic map]] &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → ''r'' ''x'' (1 – ''x'').&lt;/span&gt;  Each vertical slice shows the attractor for a specific value of ''r''.  The diagram displays [[Period-doubling bifurcation|period-doubling]] as ''r'' increases, eventually producing chaos.]]

Discrete chaotic systems, such as the logistic map, can exhibit strange attractors whatever their [[dimension]]ality. In contrast, for [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] dynamical systems, the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] shows that a strange attractor can only arise in three or more dimensions.  [[Dimension (vector space)|Finite-dimensional]] [[linear system]]s are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behavior, it must be either [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] or infinite-dimensional.

The [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] states that a two-dimensional differential equation has very regular behavior. The Lorenz attractor discussed below is generated by a system of three [[differential equation]]s such as:
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= \sigma y - \sigma x, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= \rho x - x z - y, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= x y - \beta z.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; make up the [[State space representation|system state]], &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are the system [[parameter]]s. Five of the terms on the right hand side are linear, while two are quadratic; a total of seven terms. Another well-known chaotic attractor is generated by the [[Rössler map|Rössler equations]], which have only one nonlinear term out of seven. Sprott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sprott |first=J.C.|year=1997|title=Simplest dissipative chaotic flow|journal=[[Physics Letters A]]|volume=228|issue=4–5 |pages=271–274|doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00088-1|bibcode = 1997PhLA..228..271S }}&lt;/ref&gt; found a three-dimensional system with just five terms, that had only one nonlinear term, which exhibits chaos for certain parameter values.

The reason is, simply put, that solutions to such systems are asymptotic to a two-dimensional surface and therefore solutions are well behaved.

While the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem shows that a continuous dynamical system on the Euclidean [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] cannot be chaotic, two-dimensional continuous systems with [[non-Euclidean geometry]] can exhibit chaotic behavior.&lt;ref name="Rosario 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosario|first=Pedro|title=Underdetermination of Science: Part I|date=2006|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1411693913}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps surprisingly, chaos may occur also in linear systems, provided they are infinite dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A theory of linear chaos is being developed in a branch of mathematical analysis known as [[functional analysis]].

=== Jerk systems ===
In [[physics]], [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]] is the third derivative of [[position (vector)|position]], with respect to time.  As such, differential equations of the form
:: &lt;math&gt;J\left(\overset{...}{x},\ddot{x},\dot {x},x\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;
are sometimes called ''Jerk equations''. It has been shown that a jerk equation, which is equivalent to a system of three first order, ordinary, non-linear differential equations, is in a certain sense the minimal setting for solutions showing chaotic behaviour. This motivates mathematical interest in jerk systems. Systems involving a fourth or higher derivative are called accordingly hyperjerk systems.&lt;ref&gt;K. E. Chlouverakis and J. C. Sprott, Chaos Solitons &amp; Fractals 28, 739–746 (2005), Chaotic Hyperjerk Systems, http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pubs/paper297.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A jerk system's behavior is described by a jerk equation, and for certain jerk equations, simple electronic circuits can model solutions. These circuits are known as jerk circuits.

One of the most interesting properties of jerk circuits is the possibility of chaotic behavior. In fact, certain well-known chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz attractor and the [[Rössler map]], are conventionally described as a system of three first-order differential equations that can combine into a single (although rather complicated) jerk equation. Nonlinear jerk systems are in a sense minimally complex systems to show chaotic behaviour; there is no chaotic system involving only two first-order, ordinary differential equations (the system resulting in an equation of second order only).

An example of a jerk equation with nonlinearity in the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^3 x}{\mathrm{d} t^3}+A\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\mathrm{d} t^2}+\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t}-|x|+1=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''A'' is an adjustable parameter. This equation has a chaotic solution for ''A''=3/5 and can be implemented with the following jerk circuit; the required nonlinearity is brought about by the two diodes:

[[File:JerkCircuit01.png|frameless|upright=1.4|center]]

In the above circuit, all resistors are of equal value, except &lt;math&gt;R_A=R/A=5R/3&lt;/math&gt;, and all capacitors are of equal size. The dominant frequency is &lt;math&gt;1/2\pi R C&lt;/math&gt;. The output of [[operational amplifier|op amp]] 0 will correspond to the x variable, the output of 1 corresponds to the first derivative of x and the output of 2 corresponds to the second derivative.

==Spontaneous order==
Under the right conditions, chaos spontaneously evolves into a lockstep pattern. In the [[Kuramoto model]], four conditions suffice to produce synchronization in a chaotic system.
Examples include the [[coupled oscillation]] of [[Christiaan Huygens]]' pendulums, fireflies, [[neuron]]s, the [[London Millennium Bridge]] resonance, and large arrays of [[Josephson junctions]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Strogatz, ''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Hyperion, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early proponent of chaos theory was [[Henri Poincaré]]. In the 1880s, while studying the [[three-body problem]], he found that there can be orbits that are nonperiodic, and yet not forever increasing nor approaching a fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poincaré, Jules Henri |title=Sur le problème des trois corps et les équations de la dynamique.

Chaos theory began in the field of [[ergodic theory]]. Later studies, also on the topic of nonlinear [[differential equations]], were carried out by [[George David Birkhoff]],&lt;ref&gt;George D.

Despite initial insights in the first half of the twentieth century, chaos theory became formalized as such only after mid-century, when it first became evident to some scientists that [[linear theory]], the prevailing system theory at that time, simply could not explain the observed behavior of certain experiments like that of the [[logistic map]]. What had been attributed to measure imprecision and simple "[[Pseudorandom noise|noise]]" was considered by chaos theorists as a full component of the studied systems.

The main catalyst for the development of chaos theory was the electronic computer. Much of the mathematics of chaos theory involves the repeated [[iteration]] of simple mathematical formulas, which would be impractical to do by hand. Electronic computers made these repeated calculations practical, while figures and images made it possible to visualize these systems. As a graduate student in [[Chihiro Hayashi]]'s laboratory at Kyoto University, [[Yoshisuke Ueda]] was experimenting with analog computers and noticed, on November 27, 1961, what he called "randomly transitional phenomena".  Yet his advisor did not agree with his conclusions at the time, and did not allow him to report his findings until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abraham|Ueda|2001|loc=See Chapters 3 and 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sprott|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SEDjdjPZ158C&amp;pg=PA89 89]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Airplane vortex edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turbulence]] in the [[Wingtip vortices|tip vortex]] from an [[airplane]] wing. Studies of the critical point beyond which a system creates turbulence were important for chaos theory, analyzed for example by the [[Soviet physicists|Soviet physicist]] [[Lev Landau]], who developed the [[Landau-Hopf theory of turbulence]]. [[David Ruelle]] and [[Floris Takens]] later predicted, against Landau, that [[fluid turbulence]] could develop through a [[strange attractor]], a main concept of chaos theory.]]

[[Edward Lorenz]] was an early pioneer of the theory. His interest in chaos came about accidentally through his work on [[meteorology|weather prediction]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=Lorenz1961&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lorenz, Edward N. |title=Deterministic non-periodic flow |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |volume=20 |pages=130–141 |year=1963 |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issue=2 |bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]], to run his weather simulation. He wanted to see a sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He did this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions in the middle of the original simulation. To his surprise, the weather the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Chaos: Making a New Science]] |last=Gleick |first=James |year=1987 |publisher=Cardinal |location=London|page=17|isbn=978-0-434-29554-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to [[Lorenz attractor]]s, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.

In 1963, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] found recurring patterns at every scale in data on cotton prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Benoît|last = Mandelbrot|year = 1963|title = The variation of certain speculative prices|journal = Journal of Business|volume = 36|pages = 394–419|doi = 10.1086/294632|issue = 4|jstor=2350970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beforehand he had studied [[information theory]] and concluded noise was patterned like a [[Cantor set]]: on any scale the proportion of noise-containing periods to error-free periods was a constant – thus errors were inevitable and must be planned for by incorporating redundancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Berger J.M. |author2=Mandelbrot B. | year = 1963 | title = A new model for error clustering in telephone circuits | journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development | volume = 7 |issue=3 | pages = 224–236 | doi=10.1147/rd.73.0224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot described both the "Noah effect" (in which sudden discontinuous changes can occur) and the "Joseph effect" (in which persistence of a value can occur for a while, yet suddenly change afterwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mandelbrot, B. |title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature |publisher=Freeman |location=New York |year=1977 |page=248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{cite book |last1=Mandelbrot |first1=Benoît B. |last2=Hudson |first2=Richard L. |title=The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=2004 |page=201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This challenged the idea that changes in price were [[normal distribution|normally distributed]]. In 1967, he published "[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|How long is the coast of Britain? Statistical self-similarity and fractional dimension]]", showing that a coastline's length varies with the scale of the measuring instrument, resembles itself at all scales, and is infinite in length for an [[infinitesimal]]ly small measuring device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît |title=How Long Is the Coast of Britain?

An object whose irregularity is constant over different scales ("self-similarity") is a [[fractal]] (examples include the [[Menger sponge]], the [[Sierpiński gasket]], and the [[Koch curve]] or ''snowflake'', which is infinitely long yet encloses a finite space and has a [[fractal dimension]] of circa 1.2619). In 1982, Mandelbrot published ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]'', which became a classic of chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandelbrot, B.|title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature|date=1982|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0716711865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological systems such as the branching of the circulatory and bronchial systems proved to fit a fractal model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buldyrev |first1=S.V. |last2=Goldberger |first2=A.L. | last3=Havlin |first3=S. | authorlink3=Shlomo Havlin|last4=Peng |first4=C.K. | last5=Stanley | first5=H.E. |authorlink5=H.

In December 1977, the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] organized the first symposium on chaos, attended by David Ruelle, [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Robert May]], [[James A. Yorke]] (coiner of the term "chaos" as used in mathematics), [[Robert Shaw (physicist)|Robert Shaw]], and the meteorologist Edward Lorenz. The following year, independently [[Pierre Coullet]] and [[Charles Tresser]] with the article "Iterations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation" and [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] with the article "Quantitative Universality for a Class of Nonlinear Transformations" described logistic maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mitchell |last=Feigenbaum |title=Quantitative universality for a class of nonlinear transformations |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=25–52 |date=July 1978 |doi=10.1007/BF01020332 |bibcode=1978JSP....19...25F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coullet, Pierre, and Charles Tresser. "Iterations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation." Le Journal de Physique Colloques 39.C5 (1978): C5-25&lt;/ref&gt;  They notably discovered the [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universality]] in chaos, permitting the application of chaos theory to many different phenomena.

In 1979, [[Albert J. Libchaber]], during a symposium organized in Aspen by [[Pierre Hohenberg]], presented his experimental observation of the [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] cascade that leads to chaos and turbulence in [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]] systems. He was awarded the [[Wolf Prize in Physics]] in 1986 along with [[Mitchell J. Feigenbaum]] for their inspiring achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wolffund.org.il/cat.asp?id=25&amp;cat_title=PHYSICS|title = The Wolf Prize in Physics in 1986.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the New York Academy of Sciences co-organized with the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and the [[Office of Naval Research]] the first important conference on chaos in biology and medicine. There, [[Bernardo Huberman]] presented a mathematical model of the [[eye tracking disorder]] among [[schizophrenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Bernardo Huberman |author=Huberman, B.A. |title=A Model for Dysfunctions in Smooth Pursuit Eye Movement |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=504 Perspectives in Biological Dynamics and Theoretical Medicine |pages=260–273 |date=July 1987 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb48737.x |bibcode = 1987NYASA.504..260H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a renewal of [[physiology]] in the 1980s through the application of chaos theory, for example, in the study of pathological [[cardiac cycle]]s.

In 1987, [[Per Bak]], [[Chao Tang]] and [[Kurt Wiesenfeld]] published a paper in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bak, Per; Tang, Chao; Wiesenfeld, Kurt |title=Self-organized criticality: An explanation of the 1/f noise |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=381–4 |date=27 July 1987 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381 |bibcode=1987PhRvL..59..381B|last2=Tang |last3=Wiesenfeld }} However, the conclusions of this article have been subject to dispute. {{cite web|url=http://www.nslij-genetics.org/wli/1fnoise/1fnoise_square.html |title=? |work= |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214033929/https://www.nslij-genetics.org/wli/1fnoise/1fnoise_square.html |archivedate=2007-12-14 |df= }}.

Alongside largely lab-based approaches such as the [[Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile]], many other investigations have focused on large-scale natural or social systems that are known (or suspected) to display [[scale invariance|scale-invariant]] behavior. Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including [[earthquake]]s, (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known as a source of scale-invariant behavior such as the [[Gutenberg–Richter law]] describing the statistical distribution of earthquake sizes, and the [[Aftershock|Omori law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Omori, F. |title=On the aftershocks of earthquakes |journal=Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University of Tokyo |volume=7 |pages=111–200 |year=1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the frequency of aftershocks), [[solar flare]]s, fluctuations in economic systems such as [[financial market]]s (references to SOC are common in [[econophysics]]), [[landscape formation]], [[forest fire]]s, [[landslide]]s, [[epidemic]]s, and [[biological evolution]] (where SOC has been invoked, for example, as the dynamical mechanism behind the theory of "[[punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]]" put forward by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]). Given the implications of a scale-free distribution of event sizes, some researchers have suggested that another phenomenon that should be considered an example of SOC is the occurrence of [[war]]s. These investigations of SOC have included both attempts at modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system), and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws.

In the same year, [[James Gleick]] published ''[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]'', which became a best-seller and introduced the general principles of chaos theory as well as its history to the broad public, though his history under-emphasized important Soviet contributions.{{citation needed|reason=No reason given for soviet under-emphasis|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gleick|first=James|title=Chaos: Making a New Science|date=August 26, 2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0143113454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the domain of a few, isolated individuals, chaos theory progressively emerged as a transdisciplinary and institutional discipline, mainly under the name of [[nonlinear system]]s analysis. Alluding to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s concept of a [[paradigm shift]] exposed in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), many "chaologists" (as some described themselves) claimed that this new theory was an example of such a shift, a thesis upheld by Gleick.

The availability of cheaper, more powerful computers broadens the applicability of chaos theory. Currently, chaos theory remains an active area of research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Motter | first1 = A. E. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = D.

=== Cryptography ===
Chaos theory has been used for many years in [[cryptography]]. In the past few decades, chaos and nonlinear dynamics have been used in the design of hundreds of [[cryptographic primitive]]s. These algorithms include image [[encryption algorithms]], [[hash functions]], [[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator|secure pseudo-random number generators]], [[stream ciphers]], [[Digital watermarking|watermarking]] and [[steganography]].&lt;ref name="Akhavan 1797–1813"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akhavan|first=A.|last2=Samsudin|first2=A.|last3=Akhshani|first3=A.|date=2011-10-01|title=A symmetric image encryption scheme based on combination of nonlinear chaotic maps|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016003211001104|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|volume=348|issue=8|pages=1797–1813|doi=10.1016/j.jfranklin.2011.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these algorithms are based on uni-modal chaotic maps and a big portion of these algorithms use the control parameters and the initial condition of the chaotic maps as their keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behnia|first=S.|last2=Akhshani|first2=A.|last3=Mahmodi|first3=H.|last4=Akhavan|first4=A.|date=2008-01-01|title=A novel algorithm for image encryption based on mixture of chaotic maps|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077906004681|journal=Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals|volume=35|issue=2|pages=408–419|doi=10.1016/j.chaos.2006.05.011|bibcode = 2008CSF....35..408B }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a wider perspective, without loss of generality, the similarities between the chaotic maps and the cryptographic systems is the main motivation for the design of chaos based cryptographic algorithms.&lt;ref name="Akhavan 1797–1813"/&gt; One type of encryption, secret key or [[symmetric key]], relies on [[diffusion and confusion]], which is modeled well by chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Xingyuan|year=2012|title=An improved key agreement protocol based on chaos|journal=Commun.

=== Robotics ===
Robotics is another area that has recently benefited from chaos theory. Instead of robots acting in a trial-and-error type of refinement to interact with their environment, chaos theory has been used to build a [[Predictive modelling|predictive model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nehmzow|first=Ulrich|date=Dec 2005|title=Quantitative description of robot–environment interaction using chaos theory|journal=Robotics and Autonomous Systems|volume=53|issue=3–4|pages=177–193|doi=10.1016/j.robot.2005.09.009|author2=Keith Walker|url=http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/udfn/ftp/ecmrw3.pdf|access-date=2017-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812003513/http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/udfn/ftp/ecmrw3.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chaotic dynamics have been exhibited by [[Passive dynamics|passive walking]] biped robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goswami|first=Ambarish|year=1998|title=A Study of the Passive Gait of a Compass-Like Biped Robot: Symmetry and Chaos|journal=The International Journal of Robotics Research|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1282–1301|doi=10.1177/027836499801701202|author2=Thuilot, Benoit|author3=Espiau, Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===
For over a hundred years, biologists have been keeping track of populations of different species with [[population model]]s. Most models are [[continuous function|continuous]], but recently scientists have been able to implement chaotic models in certain populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eduardo|first=Liz|author2=Ruiz-Herrera, Alfonso|title=Chaos in discrete structured population models|journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems|year=2012|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1200–1214|doi=10.1137/120868980}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study on models of [[Canada lynx|Canadian lynx]] showed there was chaotic behavior in the population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lai|first=Dejian|title=Comparison study of AR models on the Canadian lynx data: a close look at BDS statistic|journal=Computational Statistics \&amp; Data Analysis|year=1996|volume=22|issue=4|pages=409–423|doi=10.1016/0167-9473(95)00056-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaos can also be found in ecological systems, such as [[hydrology]]. While a chaotic model for hydrology has its shortcomings, there is still much to learn from looking at the data through the lens of chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sivakumar|first=B|title=Chaos theory in hydrology: important issues and interpretations|journal=Journal of Hydrology|date=31 January 2000|volume=227|issue=1–4|pages=1–20|bibcode=2000JHyd..227....1S|doi=10.1016/S0022-1694(99)00186-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another biological application is found in [[cardiotocography]]. Fetal surveillance is a delicate balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of warning signs of [[Intrauterine hypoxia|fetal hypoxia]] can be obtained through chaotic modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bozóki|first=Zsolt|title=Chaos theory and power spectrum analysis in computerized cardiotocography|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology|date=February 1997|volume=71|issue=2|pages=163–168|doi=10.1016/s0301-2115(96)02628-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other areas===
In chemistry, predicting gas solubility is essential to manufacturing [[polymers]], but models using [[particle swarm optimization]] (PSO) tend to converge to the wrong points. An improved version of PSO has been created by introducing chaos, which keeps the simulations from getting stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Mengshan|author2=Xingyuan Huanga|author3=Hesheng Liua|author4=Bingxiang Liub|author5=Yan Wub|author6=Aihua Xiongc|author7=Tianwen Dong|title=Prediction of gas solubility in polymers by back propagation artificial neural network based on self-adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm and chaos theory|journal=Fluid Phase Equilibria|date=25 October 2013|volume=356|pages=11–17|doi=10.1016/j.fluid.2013.07.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[celestial mechanics]], especially when observing asteroids, applying chaos theory leads to better predictions about when these objects will approach Earth and other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morbidelli|first=A.|title=Chaotic diffusion in celestial mechanics|journal=Regular &amp; Chaotic Dynamics |year=2001|volume=6|issue=4|pages=339–353|doi=10.1070/rd2001v006n04abeh000182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the five [[moons of Pluto]] rotate chaotically. In [[quantum physics]] and [[electrical engineering]], the study of large arrays of [[Josephson junctions]] benefitted greatly from chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Strogatz, ''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order, Hyperion, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Closer to home, coal mines have always been dangerous places where frequent natural gas leaks cause many deaths. Until recently, there was no reliable way to predict when they would occur. But these gas leaks have chaotic tendencies that, when properly modeled, can be predicted fairly accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dingqi|first=Li|author2=Yuanping Chenga|author3=Lei Wanga|author4=Haifeng Wanga|author5=Liang Wanga|author6=Hongxing Zhou|title=Prediction method for risks of coal and gas outbursts based on spatial chaos theory using gas desorption index of drill cuttings|journal=Mining Science and Technology|date=May 2011|volume=21|issue=3|pages=439–443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaos theory can be applied outside of the natural sciences, but historically nearly all such studies have suffered from lack of reproducibility; poor external validity; and/or inattention to cross-validation, resulting in poor predictive accuracy (if out-of-sample prediction has even been attempted).  Glass &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Glass | first1 = L |editor1-first=C |editor1-last= Grebogi |editor2-first=J. A. | editor2-last=Yorke |title= The impact of chaos on science and society|publisher= United Nations University Press |year=1997 |chapter= Dynamical disease:  The impact of nonlinear dynamics and chaos on cardiology and medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mandell and Selz &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mandell |first1= A. J. | last2 = Selz |first2= K. A. |editor1-first=C |editor1-last= Grebogi |editor2-first=J.

Researchers have continued to apply chaos theory to psychology. For example, in modeling group behavior in which heterogeneous members may behave as if sharing to different degrees what in [[Wilfred Bion]]'s theory is a  basic assumption, researchers have found that the group dynamic is the result of the individual dynamics of the members: each individual reproduces the group dynamics in a different scale, and the chaotic behavior of the group is reflected in each member.&lt;ref name="Dal FornoMerlone2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo | title = Nonlinear dynamics in work groups with Bion's basic assumptions | journal = Nonlinear Dynamics, Psychology, and Life Sciences | volume = 17| issue=2 | year = 2013 | pages = 295–315 | issn = 1090-0578  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redington and Reidbord (1992) attempted to demonstrate that the human heart could display chaotic traits.  They monitored the changes in between-heartbeat intervals for a single psychotherapy patient as she moved through periods of varying emotional intensity during a therapy session.  Results were admittedly inconclusive.  Not only were there ambiguities in the various plots the authors produced to purportedly show evidence of chaotic dynamics (spectral analysis, phase trajectory, and autocorrelation plots), but when they attempted to compute a Lyapunov exponent as more definitive confirmation of chaotic behavior, the authors found they could not reliably do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redington|first=D. J.|last2=Reidbord|first2=S. P.|title=Chaotic dynamics in autonomic nervous system activity of a patient during a psychotherapy session|journal=Biological Psychiatry|date=1992|volume=31|issue=10|pages=993–1007|pmid=1511082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1995 paper, Metcalf and Allen  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Metcalf |first1= B. R. | last2 = Allen |first2= J. D. |editor1-first=F. D. |editor1-last= Abraham |editor2-first=A. R. | editor2-last=Gilgen |title= Chaos theory in psychology |publisher= Greenwood Press |year=1995 |chapter= In search of chaos in schedule-induced polydipsia }}&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that they uncovered in animal behavior a pattern of period doubling leading to chaos.  The authors examined a well-known response called schedule-induced polydipsia, by which an animal deprived of food for certain lengths of time will drink unusual amounts of water when the food is at last presented.  The control parameter (r) operating here was the length of the interval between feedings, once resumed.  The authors were careful to test a large number of animals and to include many replications, and they designed their experiment so as to rule out the likelihood that changes in response patterns were caused by different starting places for r.

Time series and first delay plots provide the best support for the claims made, showing a fairly clear march from periodicity to irregularity as the feeding times were increased.  The various phase trajectory plots and spectral analyses, on the other hand, do not match up well enough with the other graphs or with the overall theory to lead inexorably to a chaotic diagnosis.  For example, the phase trajectories do not show a definite progression towards greater and greater complexity (and away from periodicity); the process seems quite muddied.  Also, where Metcalf and Allen saw periods of two and six in their spectral plots, there is room for alternative interpretations.  All of this ambiguity necessitate some serpentine, post-hoc explanation to show that results fit a chaotic model.

By adapting a model of career counseling to include a chaotic interpretation of the relationship between employees and the job market, Aniundson and Bright found that better suggestions can be made to people struggling with career decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pryor|first=Robert G. L.|author2=Norman E. Aniundson|author3=Jim E. H. Bright|title=Probabilities and Possibilities: The Strategic Counseling Implications of the Chaos Theory of Careers|journal=The Career Development Quarterly|date=June 2008|volume=56|issue=4|pages=309–318|doi=10.1002/j.2161-0045.2008.tb00096.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern organizations are increasingly seen as open [[complex adaptive system]]s with fundamental natural nonlinear structures, subject to internal and external forces that may contribute chaos. For instance, [[team building]] and [[group development]] is increasingly being researched as an inherently unpredictable system, as the uncertainty of different individuals meeting for the first time makes the trajectory of the team unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jamie|last2=Johnstone|first2=James|last3=Banks|first3=Curt|date=2018|title=An examination of initiation rituals in a UK sporting institution and the impact on group development|url=http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984|journal=European Sport Management Quarterly|pages=1–19|doi=10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say the chaos metaphor—used in verbal theories—grounded on mathematical models and psychological aspects of human behavior
provides helpful insights to describing the complexity of small work groups, that go beyond the metaphor itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo |editor1-first=Gian Italo |editor1-last=Bischi  |editor2-first=Carl | editor2-last=Chiarella |editor3-first=Irina | editor3-last=Shusko |title=Global Analysis of Dynamic Models in Economics and Finance |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2013 |pages=185–204 |chapter= Chaotic Dynamics in Organization Theory |isbn= 978-3-642-29503-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every time, all the cars of the same colour try to move one step if there is no car in front of it.

It  is possible that economic models can also be improved through an application of chaos theory, but predicting the health of an economic system and what factors influence it most is an extremely complex task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juárez|first=Fernando|title=Applying the theory of chaos and a complex model of health to establish relations among financial indicators|journal=Procedia Computer Science|year=2011|volume=3|pages=982–986|doi=10.1016/j.procs.2010.12.161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic and financial systems are fundamentally different from those in the classical natural sciences since the former are inherently stochastic in nature, as they result from the interactions of people, and thus pure deterministic models are unlikely to provide accurate representations of the data. The empirical literature that tests for chaos in economics and finance presents very mixed results, in part due to confusion between specific tests for chaos and more general tests for non-linear relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Brooks (academic)|title=Chaos in foreign exchange markets: a sceptical view |journal=Computational Economics|year=1998 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=265–281 |issn=1572-9974 |doi=10.1023/A:1008650024944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traffic forecasting may benefit from applications of chaos theory. Better predictions of when traffic will occur would allow measures to be taken to disperse it before it would have occurred. Combining chaos theory principles with a few other methods has led to a more accurate short-term prediction model (see the plot of the BML traffic model at right).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jin|author2=Qixin Shi|title=Short-term traffic speed forecasting hybrid model based on Chaos–Wavelet Analysis-Support Vector Machine theory|journal=Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies|date=February 2013|volume=27|pages=219–232|doi=10.1016/j.trc.2012.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaos theory has been applied to environmental [[water cycle]] data (aka hydrological data), such as rainfall and streamflow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/chaos-hydrology/|title=Dr. Gregory B. Pasternack – Watershed Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Ecohydraulics :: Chaos in Hydrology|website=pasternack.ucdavis.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies have yielded controversial results, because the methods for detecting a chaotic signature are often relatively subjective.  Early studies tended to "succeed" in finding chaos, whereas subsequent studies and meta-analyses called those studies into question and provided explanations for why these datasets are not likely to have low-dimension chaotic dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B.|date=1999-11-01|title=Does the river run wild?

The term '''''charisma''''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|z|m|ə}}; pl. ''charismata'', adj. ''charismatic'') has two senses:&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary'', edited by Angus Stevenson and Christine A. Lindberg. Oxford University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

# compelling attractiveness or charm that can inspire devotion in others
# a divinely conferred power or talent

''Oxford Dictionary of English'', edited by Angus Stevenson. Oxford University Press, 2010.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1950s, the term has become widely{{quantify|date=July 2017}} used, with varying meanings, in religion, the [[Social science|social sciences]], the [[biological sciences]], the media, and throughout Western societies.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Since the advent of [[Dungeons_%26_Dragons|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]] in 1974, the word charisma has also been used as an attribute in gaming, where it designates a character's likeability and their ability to persuade.

==Etymology==
The English term ''charisma'' is from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|χάρισμα}} (''khárisma''), which means "favor freely given" or "gift of grace".&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) 266–283. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt; The term and its plural {{lang|grc|χαρίσματα}} (''charismata'') derive from {{lang|grc|χάρις}} (''charis''), which means "grace". Some derivatives from that root (including "grace") have similar meanings to the modern sense of ''personality charisma'', such as "filled with attractiveness or charm", "kindness", "to bestow a favor or service", or "to be favored or blessed".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;"charisma" in ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' second edition. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beekes, Robert. ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek''. Brill, 2010, p. 1607.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Koine Greek|ancient Greek dialect]] widely used in [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]] employed these terms without the connotations found in modern religious usage.&lt;ref name=Ebertz&gt;Ebertz, Michael N. "Charisma" in ''Religion Past &amp; Present.'' edited by Hans Dieter Betz, et al., Brill, 2007, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek]]s applied personality charisma to their [[Greek mythology|gods]]; for example, attributing charm, beauty, nature, human creativity or fertility to goddesses they called ''[[Charites]]'' ({{lang|grc|Χάριτες}}).

Theologians and social scientists have expanded and modified the original Greek meaning into the two distinct senses above. For ease of reference, we will call the first sense ''personality charisma'' and the second ''divinely conferred charisma''.

The meaning of ''charisma'' has become greatly diffused from its original ''divinely conferred'' meaning, and even from the ''personality charisma'' meaning in modern English dictionaries, which reduces to a mixture of charm and status. John Potts, who has extensively analyzed the term's history, sums up meanings beneath this diffused common usage:&lt;blockquote&gt;Contemporary charisma maintains, however, the irreducible character ascribed to it by Weber: it retains a mysterious, elusive quality. Media commentators regularly describe charisma as the "X-factor". …The enigmatic character of charisma also suggests a connection – at least to some degree – to the earliest manifestations of charisma as a spiritual gift.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, John. A History of Charisma. Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Divinely conferred charisma===
The [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Bible|Christian Bible]] record the development of ''divinely conferred charisma''. In the Hebrew text the idea of charismatic leadership is generally signaled by the use of the noun ''hen'' (favor) or the verb ''hanan'' (to show favor). The Greek term for ''charisma'' (grace or favor), and its root ''charis'' (grace) replaced the Hebrew terms in the Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (the 3rd century BC [[Koine Greek#Biblical Koine|Septuagint]]). Throughout, "the paradigmatic image of the charismatic hero is the figure who has received God's favor".&lt;ref name = Scheper&gt;Scheper, George L. "Charisma" in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' edited by Lindsay Jones. Macmillan Reference USA, 2005, v 3, p. 1545.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ''divinely conferred charisma''&lt;ref&gt;Grabo, A., Spisak, B. R., &amp; van Vugt, M. (2017). Charisma as signal: An evolutionary perspective on charismatic leadership. The Leadership Quarterly, 28(4), 473-485. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.&lt;/ref&gt; applied to highly revered figures.

Thus, Eastern Mediterranean Jews in the 1st century CE had notions of ''charis'' and ''charisma'' that embraced the range of meanings found in Greek culture and the spiritual meanings from the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, John. ''A History of Charisma''. PalgraveMacMillan, 2009, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; From this linguistic legacy of fused cultures, in [[1 Corinthians]], [[Paul the Apostle]] introduced the meaning that the Holy Spirit bestowed ''charism'' and ''charismata'', "the gift of God's grace", upon individuals or groups. For Paul, "[t]here is a clear distinction between charisma and charis; charisma is the direct result of divine charis or grace".&lt;ref&gt;Potts, 2009, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheper, 2005, p. 1549&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Testament]] [[Epistle]]s, Paul refers to ''charisma'' or its plural ''charismata'' seven times in [[1 Corinthians]], written in [[Koine Greek|Koine]] (or common) Greek around 54 CE. He elaborates on his concepts with six references in Romans (c. 56). He makes 3 individual references in [[2 Corinthians]] (c. 56), [[1 Timothy]], and [[2 Timothy]] (c. 62 – c. 67). The seventeenth and only other mention of ''charisma'' is in 1 Peter.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3), pp. 268-269. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ebertz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potts, 2009, pp. 23, 37, 43, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia''. Thomson/Gale, 2003, v. 3, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gospel]]s, written in the late first century, apply ''divinely conferred charisma'' to revered figures. Examples are accounts of [[Jesus|Jesus']] [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]] and of his [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]], in which disciples see him as radiant with light, appearing together with Moses and Elijah. Another example is [[Gabriel|Gabriel's]] greeting to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] as "full of grace".&lt;ref  name=Scheper/&gt; In these and other instances [[early Christians]] designated certain individuals as possessing "spiritual gifts", and these gifts included "the ability to penetrate the neighbour to the bottom of his heart and spirit and to recognize whether he is dominated by a good or by an evil spirit and the gift to help him to freedom from his demon".&lt;ref name=Benz&gt;Benz, Ernst Wilhelm. "The Roles of Christianity" in ''The new Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 16, 1986, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Believers characterized their revered religious figures as having "a higher perfection… a special ''Charisma''".&lt;ref name=Benz/&gt; Then, with the establishment of the [[Christian Church]], "the old charismatic gifts and free offerings were transformed into a hierarchical sacerdotal system".&lt;ref&gt;Troeltsch, Ernst. ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches'', translated by Olive Wyon. Allen and Unwin, v. 1, 1911/1931, pp. 99, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on the institution rather than divinely inspired individuals increasingly dominated religious thought and life, and that focus went unchanged for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, William and Mary Morse. ''Harper's Dictionary of Contemporary Usage''. Harper and Row, 1985, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional changes began in the 17th century when church leaders, notably in the [[Western Christianity|Latin tradition]], accented "individual gifts [and] particular talents imparted by [[God in Christianity|God]] or the [[Holy Spirit]]". The 19th century brought an increasing shift in emphasis toward individual and spiritual aspects of charisma; [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and some [[Catholic]] [[Theology|theologians]] narrowed the concept to superlative, out-of-the-ordinary, and virtuoso gifts. Simultaneously, the term became alienated from the much wider meaning that [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] had attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;Ebertz, 2007, pp. 493–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the narrowed term projected back to the earlier period "A systematically reflected and highly differentiated understanding of charisma was often unconsciously infused into the Scriptures and writings of the church fathers, so that these texts were no longer read through the eyes of the authors".&lt;ref&gt;Baumert, N. "'Charisma' – Versuch einer Sprachregelung." ''ThPh'' 66, 1991, p. 22. Quoted in Ebertz, 2007, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt;

These dialectic meanings influenced notable changes in [[Pentecostalism]] in the late 19th century, and [[charismatic movements]] in some mainline churches in the mid-20th century. The discussion in the [[#21st century religion|21st Century Religion]] section explores what ''charisma'' means in these and other religious groups.

===Personality charisma===
The basis for modern secular usage comes from [[Germans|German]] [[sociologist]] [[Max Weber]]. He discovered the term in the work of [[Rudolph Sohm]], a [[Germans|German]] [[church historian]] whose 1892 ''Kirchenrecht''&lt;ref&gt;Sohm, Rudolf. ''Kirchenrecht''. Leipzig: Duncher &amp; Humblot, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; was immediately recognized in Germany as an epoch-making work.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) 269-270. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt; It also stimulated a debate between Sohm and leading theologians and religion scholars, which lasted more than twenty years and stimulated a rich polemical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, David Norman. "Faith, Reason, and Charisma: Rudolf Sohm, Max Weber, and the Theology of Grace," ''Sociological Inquiry'', 68:1 pp. 32–60, 1998, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate and literature had made ''charisma'' a popular term when Weber used it in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and in his [[Sociology of Religion (book)|''Sociology of Religion'']]. Perhaps because he assumed that readers already understood the idea, Weber's early writings lacked definition or explanation of the concept.  In the collection of his works, ''Economy and Society'' edited by his wife, he identified the term as a prime example of action he labeled "value-rational," in distinction from and opposition to action he labeled "Instrumentally rational."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|publisher= Bedminster Press|year=1968|pages=24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because he applied meanings for ''charisma'' similar to Sohm, who had affirmed the purely charismatic nature of early Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;Scheper, 2005, p. 1544.&lt;/ref&gt; Weber's ''charisma'' would have coincided with the ''divinely conferred charisma'' sense defined above in Sohm's work.

Weber introduced the ''personality charisma'' sense when he applied ''charisma'' to designate a form of authority. To explain [[charismatic authority]] he developed his classic definition:&lt;blockquote&gt;Charisma is a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities. These as such are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are regarded as of divine origin or as exemplary, and on the basis of them the individual concerned is treated as a leader.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max. ''The Theory of Social and Economic Organization'', translated by A. M. Henderson and Talcott Parsons. Free Press, 1924/1947, pp. 328, 358ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here Weber extends the concept of charisma beyond supernatural to superhuman and even to exceptional powers and qualities. Sociologist Paul Joosse examined Weber's famous definition, and found that:&lt;blockquote&gt;through simple yet profoundly consequential phrases such as “are considered” and “is treated,” charisma becomes a relational, attributable, and at last a properly sociological concept.... For Weber, the locus of power is in the led, who actively (if perhaps unconsciously) invest their leaders with social authority.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) pp.271. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, Weber indicates that it is followers who attribute the individual with powers, emphasizing that "the recognition on the part of those subject to authority" is decisive for the validity of charisma.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max. 1947, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber died in 1920 leaving "disordered, fragmentary manuscripts without even the guidance of a plan or table of the proposed contents". One unfinished manuscript contained his above quoted definition of ''charisma''.&lt;ref name=MacRae&gt;MacRae, Donald G. ''Max Weber''. Viking, 1974, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; It took over a quarter century for his work to be translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;"Max Weber" in ''Dictionary of the Social Sciences'', edited by Craig Calhoun. Oxford University Press. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to charisma, Weber's formulations are generally regarded as having revived the concept from its deep theological obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Stephen. "Charisma Reconsidered," pp. 5–26 in ''Journal of Classical Sociology'', 3:5, 2003, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even with the admirable translations and prefaces of his entire works, many scholars have found Weber's formulations ambiguous. For the past half-century they have debated the meaning of many Weberian concepts, including the meaning of ''charisma,'' the role of followers, and the degree of a supernatural component.&lt;ref name=MacRae/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Sonja M. 1984. "The Role of Leadership in the Construction of Reality," pp. 157–178 in ''Leadership Multidisciplinary Perspectives'', edited by Barbara Kellerman. Prentice-Hall, 1984, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford. "Centers, Kings, and Charisma: Reflections on the Symbolics of Power," in ''Culture and Its Creators'' edited by Ben-David J. Clark. University of Chicago Press, pp. 150–171, 1977, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Worsley, Peter. 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rustow, Dankwart A. "The Study of Leadership." ''Philosophers and Kings: Studies in Leadership'', edited by Dankwart A. Rustow. Braziller, 1970, pp. 10–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Willem Stutje (ed.), ''Charismatic Leadership and Social Movements: The Revolutionary Power of Ordinary Men and Women''. Berghahn Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Although sociologists have been most active in applying Weber's ideas, researchers in management and organizational behavior including [[John Antonakis]] and his colleagues, have reignited interest in charisma with respect to defining the term in unambiguous ways, finding ways to experimentally manipulate charisma, and to estimate the causal effects of charisma on performance outcomes in work and political settings.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacquart, P. &amp; Antonakis, J. 2015.

In [[psychiatry]], '''confabulation''' (verb: '''confabulate''') is a [[memory error]] defined as the production of fabricated, distorted, or misinterpreted memories about oneself or the world, without the conscious intention to deceive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fotopoulou A. |author2=Conway M.

== Description ==

Confabulation is distinguished from [[Lie|lying]] as there is no intent to deceive and the person is unaware the information is false.&lt;ref name="Moscovitch"&gt;Moscovitch M. 1995. "Confabulation". In (Eds. Schacter D.L., Coyle J.T., Fischbach G.D., Mesulum M.M. &amp; Sullivan L.G.), ''Memory Distortion''. pp. 226–51. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although individuals can present blatantly false information, confabulation can also seem to be coherent, internally consistent, and relatively normal.&lt;ref name="Moscovitch" /&gt;

Most known cases of confabulation are symptomatic of brain damage or dementias, such as [[aneurysm]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], or [[Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome]] (a common manifestation of [[thiamine]] deficiency caused by [[alcoholism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23887463 | volume=113 | issue=6 Pt 2 | title=[Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis: clinical-pathophysiological correlation, diagnostics and treatment] | year=2013 | journal=Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova | pages=20–26 | author = Sivolap IuP Damulin IV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally confabulation often occurs in people who are suffering from anticholinergic [[toxidrome]] when interrogated about bizarre or irrational behaviour.

Confabulated memories of all types most often occur in [[autobiographical memory]] and are indicative of a complicated and intricate process that can be led astray at any point during [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]], [[Storage (memory)|storage]], or [[Recall (memory)|recall]] of a memory.&lt;ref name=book/&gt; This type of confabulation is commonly seen in [[Korsakoff's syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Korsakoff Syndrome: Clinical Aspects, Psychology and Treatment|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |volume=44|issue=2|pages=148–54|doi=10.1093/alcalc/agn118|url=http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/2/148.full|pmid=19151162 |year=2009|author1=Kopelman |first1=M. D. |last2=Thomson |first2=A. D. |last3=Guerrini |first3=I |last4=Marshall |first4=E. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distinctions ===
Two types of confabulation are often distinguished:
* '''Provoked''' (momentary, or secondary) confabulations represent a normal response to a faulty memory, are common in both amnesia and dementia,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and can become apparent during memory tests.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt;
* '''Spontaneous''' (or primary) confabulations do not occur in response to a cue&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt; and seem to be involuntary.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilboa|first=A.|title=Mechanisms of spontaneous confabulations: a strategic retrieval account|journal=Brain|date=13 April 2006|volume=129|issue=6|pages=1399–1414|doi=10.1093/brain/awl093|pmid=16638795}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are relatively rare, more common in cases of dementia, and may result from the interaction between frontal lobe pathology and organic amnesia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=3694207|pmc=1032561|year=1987|author1=Kopelman|first1=M. D.|title=Two types of confabulation|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry|volume=50|issue=11|pages=1482–87|doi=10.1136/jnnp.50.11.1482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another distinction is that between:&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt;
* '''Verbal''' confabulations, spoken false memories are more common, and 
* '''Behavioral''' confabulations, occur when an individual acts on their false memories.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Confabulation is associated with several characteristics:
# Typically verbal statements but can also be non-verbal gestures or actions.
# Can include autobiographical and non-personal information, such as historical facts, fairy-tales, or other aspects of semantic memory.
# The account can be fantastic or coherent.
# Both the premise and the details of the account can be false.
# The account is usually drawn from the patient's memory of actual experiences, including past and current thoughts.
# The patient is unaware of the accounts' distortions or inappropriateness, and is not concerned when errors are pointed out.
# There is no hidden motivation behind the account.
# The patient's personality structure may play a role in his/her readiness to confabulate.&lt;ref name="Moscovitch" /&gt;

==Theories==
Theories of confabulation range in emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;Berrios G.E. (1998) Confabulation: a conceptual history. ''Journal of the History of the Neurosciences'' 7: 225-241. &lt;/ref&gt; Some theories propose that confabulations represent a way for memory-disabled people to maintain their self-identity.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Metcalf|first=Kasey |author2=Langdon, Robyn |author3=Coltheart, Max|title=Models of confabulation: A critical review and a new framework|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=1 February 2007|volume=24|issue=1|pages=23–47|doi=10.1080/02643290600694901|pmid=18416482 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories use neurocognitive links to explain the process of confabulation.&lt;ref name="Spontaneous and Fantastic Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glowinski|first=Remy |author2=Payman, Vahid |author3=Frencham, Kate|title=Confabulation: a spontaneous and fantastic review|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|date=2008|volume=42|issue=11|pages=932–40|doi=10.1080/00048670802415335|pmid=18941957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still other theories frame confabulation around the more familiar concept of delusion.&lt;ref name="varieties of confabulation and delusion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopelman|first=Michael D.|title=Varieties of confabulation and delusion|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry|date=2010|volume=15|issue=1–3|pages=14–37|doi=10.1080/13546800902732830}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers frame confabulation within the [[fuzzy-trace theory]].&lt;ref name="fuzzy trace theory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brainerd|first=C.J.|author2=Reyna, V.F.|title=Fuzzy-Trace Theory and Children's False Memories|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|date=1 November 1998|volume=71|issue=2|pages=81–129|doi=10.1006/jecp.1998.2464|pmid=9843617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, some researchers call for theories that rely less on neurocognitive explanations and more on [[epistemic]] accounts.&lt;ref name="faultless ignorance"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bortolotti|first=Lisa|author2=Cox, Rochelle E.|title='Faultless' ignorance: Strengths and limitations of epistemic definitions of confabulation|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=1 December 2009|volume=18|issue=4|pages=952–65|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2009.08.011|pmid=19773185}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Neuropsychological theories===
The most popular theories of confabulation come from the field of neuropsychology or cognitive neuroscience.&lt;ref name="Spontaneous and Fantastic Review"/&gt; Research suggests that confabulation is associated with dysfunction of cognitive processes that control the retrieval from long-term memory. Frontal lobe damage often disrupts this process, preventing the retrieval of information and the evaluation of its output.&lt;ref name=Baddeley1986&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511558313.020|chapter=Amnesia, autobiographical memory, and confabulation|title=Autobiographical Memory|pages=225–52|year=1986|last1=Baddeley|first1=Alan|last2=Wilson|first2=Barbara|isbn=9780511558313|editor-last1= Rubin |editor-first1=David C.|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Moscovitch M. |author2=Melo B. | year = 1997 | title = Strategic retrieval and the frontal lobes: evidence from confabulation and amnesia | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 35 | issue = 7| pages = 1017–34 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(97)00028-6|pmid=9226662 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, researchers argue that confabulation is a disorder resulting from failed "reality monitoring/source monitoring" (i.e. deciding whether a memory is based on an actual event or whether it is imagined).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, M.K. (1991). Reality monitoring: Evidence from confabulation in organic brain disease patients. In G.P. Prigatano &amp; D.L. Schacter (Eds.), Awareness of deficit after brain injury. pp. 176–97. New York: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Some neuropsychologists suggest that errors in retrieval of information from long-term memory that are made by normal subjects involve different components of control processes than errors made by confabulators.&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=8817460|year=1996|author1=Burgess|first1=P. W.|title=Confabulation and the control of recollection|journal=Memory|volume=4|issue=4|pages=359–411|last2=Shallice|first2=T|doi=10.1080/096582196388906}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin]] distinguished two subtypes of confabulation, one of which he called simple confabulation, caused partly by errors in the temporal ordering of real events. The other variety he called fantastic confabulation, which was bizarre and patently impossible statements not rooted in true memory. Simple confabulation may result from damage to memory systems in the medial temporal lobe. Fantastic confabulations reveal a dysfunction of the Supervisory System,&lt;ref&gt;Norman, D.A., &amp; Shallice, T. (1980). Attention to action. Willed and automatic control of behavior. University of California San Diego CHIP Report 99. Later published as: {{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-0629-1_1|chapter=Attention to Action: Willed and Automatic Control of Behavior|title=Consciousness and Self-Regulation|pages=1–18|year=1986|last1=Norman|first1=Donald A.|last2=Shallice|first2=Tim|isbn=978-1-4757-0631-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is believed to be a function of the frontal cortex.

===Self-identity theory===
Some argue confabulations have a self-serving, emotional component in those with memory deficits that aids to maintain a coherent self-concept.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt; In other words, people who confabulate are motivated to do so, because they have gaps in their memory that they want to fill in and cover up.

===Temporality theory===
Support for the temporality account suggests that confabulations occur when an individual is unable to place events properly in time.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt; Thus, an individual might correctly state an action he/she performed, but say he/she did it yesterday, when he/she did it weeks ago. In the Memory, Consciousness, and Temporality Theory, confabulation occurs because of a deficit in temporal consciousness or awareness.&lt;ref name="temporal theory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalla Barba|first=Gianfranco|author2=Boissé, Marie-Françoise|title=Temporal consciousness and confabulation: Is the medial temporal lobe "temporal"?|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry|date=2010|volume=15|issue=1–3|pages=95–117|doi=10.1080/13546800902758017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monitoring theory===
Along a similar notion are the theories of reality and source monitoring theories.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; In these theories, confabulation occurs when individuals incorrectly attribute memories as reality, or incorrectly attribute memories to a certain source. Thus, an individual might claim an imagined event happened in reality, or that a friend told him/her about an event he/she actually heard about on television.

===Strategic retrieval account theory===
Supporters of the strategic retrieval account suggest that confabulations occur when an individual cannot actively monitor a memory for truthfulness after its retrieval.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; An individual recalls a memory, but there is some deficit after recall that interferes with the person establishing its falseness.

===Executive control theory===
Still others propose that all types of false memories, including confabulation, fit into a general memory and executive function model.&lt;ref name="varieties of false memory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopelman|first=Michael D.|title=Varieties of False Memory|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=1 May 1999|volume=16|issue=3–5|pages=197–214|doi=10.1080/026432999380762}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a framework for confabulation was proposed that stated confabulation is the result of two things: Problems with executive control and problems with evaluation. In the executive control deficit, the incorrect memory is retrieved from the brain. In the evaluative deficit, the memory will be accepted as a truth due to an inability to distinguish a belief from an actual memory.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt;

===In the context of delusion theories===
Recent models of confabulation have attempted to build upon the link between [[delusion]] and confabulation.&lt;ref name="varieties of confabulation and delusion"/&gt; More recently, a monitoring account for delusion, applied to confabulation, proposed both the inclusion of conscious and unconscious processing. The claim was that by encompassing the notion of both processes, spontaneous versus provoked confabulations could be better explained. In other words, there are two ways to confabulate. One is the unconscious, spontaneous way in which a memory goes through no logical, explanatory processing. The other is the conscious, provoked way in which a memory is recalled intentionally by the individual to explain something confusing or unusual.&lt;ref name="confabulation and delusion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Martha|author2=Coltheart, Max|title=Confabulation and delusion: A common monitoring framework|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry|date=2010|volume=15|issue=1–3|pages=346–76|doi=10.1080/13546800903441902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuzzy-trace theory===
[[Fuzzy-trace theory]], or FTT, is a concept more commonly applied to the explanation of judgement decisions.&lt;ref name="fuzzy trace theory" /&gt; According to this theory, memories are encoded generally (gist), as well as specifically (verbatim). Thus, a confabulation could result from recalling the incorrect verbatim memory or from being able to recall the gist portion, but not the verbatim portion, of a memory.

FTT uses a set of five principles to explain false-memory phenomena. Principle 1 suggests that subjects store verbatim information and gist information parallel to one another. Both forms of storage involve the surface content of an experience. Principle 2 shares factors of retrieval of gist and verbatim traces. Principle 3 is based on dual-opponent processes in [[false memory]]. Generally, gist retrieval supports false memory, while verbatim retrieval suppresses it. Developmental variability is the topic of Principle 4. As a child develops into an adult, there is obvious improvement in the acquisition, retention, and retrieval of both verbatim and gist memory. However, during late adulthood, there will be a decline in these abilities. Finally, Principle 5 explains that verbatim and gist processing cause vivid remembering. Fuzzy-trace Theory, governed by these 5 principles, has proved useful in explaining false memory and generating new predictions about it.&lt;ref name="Fuzzy-Trace Theory and False Memory"&gt;Brainerd, C. J., &amp; Reyna, V. F. (2002). Fuzzy-Trace Theory and False Memory. Current Directions In Psychological Science (Wiley–Blackwell), 11(5), 164–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemic theory===
However, not all accounts are so embedded in the neurocognitive aspects of confabulation. Some attribute confabulation to epistemic accounts.&lt;ref name="faultless ignorance"/&gt; In 2009, theories underlying the causation and mechanisms for confabulation were criticized for their focus on neural processes, which are somewhat unclear, as well as their emphasis on the negativity of false remembering. Researchers proposed that an epistemic account of confabulation would be more encompassing of both the advantages and disadvantages of the process.

==Presentation==

===Associated neurological and psychological conditions===
Confabulations are often symptoms of various syndromes and psychopathologies in the adult population including: [[Korsakoff's syndrome]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[traumatic brain injury]].

[[Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome]] is a neurological disorder typically characterized by years of chronic alcohol abuse and a nutritional thiamine deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10487391|year=1999|author1=Homewood|first1=J|title=Thiamin deficiency and Korsakoff's syndrome: Failure to find memory impairments following nonalcoholic Wernicke's encephalopathy|journal=Alcohol |location=Fayetteville, N.Y.|volume=19|issue=1|pages=75–84|last2=Bond|first2=N. W.|doi=10.1016/s0741-8329(99)00027-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confabulation is one salient symptom of this syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dalla Barba G. |author2=Cipolotti L. |author3=Denes G. | year = 1990 | title = Autobiographical memory loss and confabulation in Korsakoff's syndrome: A case report | url = | journal = Cortex | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 525–34 | doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(13)80302-4|pmid=2081390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessels RP, Kortrijk HE, Wester AJ, Nys GM. Confabulation behavior and false memories in Korsakoff's syndrome: role of source memory and executive functioning. Psychiatry Clin Neurosci. 2008 Apr; 62(2) 220–25.&lt;/ref&gt; A study on confabulation in Korsakoff’s patients found that they are subject to provoked confabulation when prompted with questions pertaining to [[episodic memory]], not [[semantic memory]], and when prompted with questions where the appropriate response would be "I don’t know."&lt;ref name="Korsakoff's"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damme|first=Ilse|author2=d'Ydewalle, Géry|title=Confabulation versus experimentally induced false memories in Korsakoff patients|journal=Journal of Neuropsychology|year=2010|volume=4|issue=2|pages=211–30|doi=10.1348/174866409X478231}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that confabulation in these patients is "domain-specific." Korsakoff’s patients who confabulate are more likely than healthy adults to falsely recognize [[Negative priming#Distractor inhibition model|distractor]] words, suggesting that false recognition is a "confabulatory behavior."

[[Alzheimer's disease]] is a condition with both neurological and psychological components. It is a form of dementia associated with severe frontal lobe dysfunction. Confabulation in individuals with Alzheimer's is often more spontaneous than it is in other conditions, especially in the advanced stages of the disease. Alzheimer's patients demonstrate comparable abilities to encode information as healthy elderly adults, suggesting that impairments in encoding are not associated with confabulation.&lt;ref name=Alzheimer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Janine M.|author2=Shanks, Michael F. |author3=Venneri, Annalena |title=Provoked confabulations in Alzheimer's disease|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=11 May 2006|volume=44|issue=10|pages=1697–1707|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.03.029|pmid=16697019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as seen in Korsakoff's patients, confabulation in Alzheimer's patients is higher when prompted with questions investigating episodic memory. Researchers suggest this is due to damage in the posterior cortical regions of the brain, which is a symptom characteristic of Alzheimer's Disease.

[[Schizophrenia]] is a psychological disorder in which confabulation is sometimes observed. Although confabulation is usually coherent in its presentation, confabulations of schizophrenic patients are often delusional&lt;ref&gt;Wing, J. K., Cooper, J. E., [[Norman Sartorius|Sartorius, N.]] 1974. The description and classification of psychiatric symptoms: An instruction manual for the PSE and catego system. London: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have noted that these patients tend to make up delusions on the spot which are often fantastic and become increasingly elaborate with questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17506924|year=2007|author1=Lorente-Rovira|first1=E|title=Confabulation in schizophrenia and its relationship to clinical and neuropsychological features of the disorder|journal=Psychological Medicine|volume=37|issue=10|pages=1403–12|last2=Pomarol-Clotet|first2=E|last3=McCarthy|first3=R. A.|last4=Berrios|first4=G. E.|last5=McKenna|first5=P. J.|doi=10.1017/S0033291707000566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike patients with Korsakoff's and Alzheimer's, patients with schizophrenia are more likely to confabulate when prompted with questions regarding their semantic memories, as opposed to episodic memory prompting.&lt;ref name=schizophrenia&gt;{{cite journal|title=Confabulation in schizophrenia: A neuropsychological study|journal=Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society|date=1 November 2010|volume=16|issue=6|pages=1018–26|doi=10.1017/S1355617710000718|pmid=20630120|author1=Lorente-Rovira|first1=E|last2=Santos-Gómez|first2=J. L.|last3=Moro|first3=M|last4=Villagrán|first4=J. M.|last5=McKenna|first5=P. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, confabulation does not appear to be related to any memory deficit in schizophrenic patients. This is contrary to most forms of confabulation. Also, confabulations made by schizophrenic patients often do not involve the creation of new information, but instead involve an attempt by the patient to reconstruct actual details of a past event.

[[Traumatic brain injury]] (TBI) can also result in confabulation. Research has shown that patients with damage to the inferior medial frontal lobe confabulate significantly more than patients with damage to the posterior area and healthy controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Martha S. |author2=Cipolotti, Lisa |author3=Yousry, Tarek A. |author4=Shallice, Tim|title=Confabulation: Damage to a specific inferior medial prefrontal system|journal=Cortex|date=1 June 2008|volume=44|issue=6|pages=637–48|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2007.01.002|pmid=18472034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that this region is key in producing confabulatory responses, and that memory deficit is important but not necessary in confabulation. Additionally, research suggests that confabulation can be seen in patients with frontal lobe syndrome, which involves an insult to the frontal lobe as a result of disease or traumatic brain injury (TBI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1988 | title = Frontal amnesia and the dysexecutive syndrome | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 212–30 | doi=10.1016/0278-2626(88)90031-0|pmid=3377900 | author1 = Baddeley | first1 = A | last2 = Wilson | first2 = B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1997 | title = Confabulation in a dysexecutive patient: Implications for models of retrieval | url = | journal = Cortex | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 743–52 | doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70731-7|pmid=9444475 | author1 = Papagno | first1 = C | last2 = Baddeley | first2 = A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | year = 1996 | title = Exploring the Central Executive | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 49A | issue = 1| pages = 5–28 |doi=10.1080/713755608| last1 = Baddeley | first1 = Alan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, rupture of the anterior or posterior communicating artery, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and encephalitis are also possible causes of confabulation.&lt;ref name=Baddeley1986/&gt;&lt;ref name="DallaBarba1993a"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dalla Barba G | year = 1993 | title = Confabulation: knowledge and recollective experience | url = | journal = Cognitive Neuropsychology | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1080/02643299308253454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location of brain lesions===
Confabulation is believed to be a result of damage to the right frontal lobe of the brain.&lt;ref name="Moscovitch"/&gt; In particular, damage can be localized to the ventromedial frontal lobes and other structures fed by the anterior communicating artery (ACoA), including the basal forebrain, septum, fornix, cingulate gyrus, cingulum, anterior hypothalamus, and head of the caudate nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=6539437 |year=1984 |author1=Alexander |first1=M. P. |title=Amnesia after anterior communicating artery aneurysm rupture |journal=Neurology |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=752–57 |last2=Freedman |first2=M |doi=10.1212/wnl.34.6.752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 1596082 |year= 1992 |author1= Irle |first1= E |title= Memory disturbances following anterior communicating artery rupture |journal= Annals of Neurology |volume= 31 |issue= 5 |pages= 473–80 |last2= Wowra |first2= B |last3= Kunert |first3= H. J. |last4= Hampl |first4= J |last5= Kunze |first5= S |doi= 10.1002/ana.410310503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental differences===
While some recent literature has suggested that older adults may be more susceptible than their younger counterparts to have false memories, the majority of research on forced confabulation centers around children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brainerd |first=C. J. |author2=Reyna, V. F. |author3=Ceci, S. J.  |title=Developmental reversals in false memory: A review of data and theory |journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2008|volume=134|issue=3|pages=343–82|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.134.3.343|pmid=18444700 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are particularly susceptible to forced confabulations based on their high suggestibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Lauren R. |author2=Purdy, Telisa L. |title=Suggestibility and source monitoring errors: blame the interview style, interviewer consistency, and the child's personality|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology |year=2005 |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=489–506 |doi=10.1002/acp.1093}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Lauren R. |author2=Blackford, Cheryl |author3=Chen, Chiung-Fen |title=Eyewitness memory for a simulated misdemeanor crime: the role of age and temperament in suggestibility |journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology |year=2005 |volume=19 |issue=3|pages=267–89 |doi=10.1002/acp.1089}}&lt;/ref&gt; When forced to recall confabulated events, children are less likely to remember that they had previously confabulated these situations, and they are more likely than their adult counterparts to come to remember these confabulations as real events that transpired.&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ackil |first=Jennifer K. |author2=Zaragoza, Maria S. |title=Memorial consequences of forced confabulation: Age differences in susceptibility to false memories |journal=Developmental Psychology |date=1 November 1998 |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=1358–72 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.34.6.1358|pmid=9823517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that this inability to distinguish between past confabulatory and real events is centered on developmental differences in source monitoring. Due to underdeveloped encoding and critical reasoning skills, children's ability to distinguish real memories from false memories may be impaired. It may also be that younger children lack the meta-memory processes required to remember confabulated versus non-confabulated events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ghetti |first=Simona |author2=Castelli, Paola |author3=Lyons, Kristen E. |title=Knowing about not remembering: developmental dissociations in lack-of-memory monitoring |journal=Developmental Science |year=2010 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=611–21 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00908.x|pmid=20590725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's meta-memory processes may also be influenced by expectancies or biases, in that they believe that highly plausible false scenarios are not confabulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ghetti |first=Simona |author2=Alexander, Kristen Weede|title="If It Happened, I Would Remember It": Strategic Use of Event Memorability in the Rejection of False Autobiographical Events |journal=Child Development |year=2004 |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=542–61 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00692.x|pmid=15056205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when knowingly being tested for accuracy, children are more likely to respond, "I don’t know" at a rate comparable to adults for unanswerable questions than they are to confabulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roebers |first=Claudia |author2=Fernandez, Olivia |title=The Effects of Accuracy Motivation on Children's and Adults' Event Recall, Suggestibility, and Their Answers to Unanswerable Questions |journal=Journal of Cognition and Development |year=2002 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=415–43 |doi=10.1207/S15327647JCD3,4-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scoboria|first=Alan |author2=Mazzoni, Giuliana |author3=Kirsch, Irving|title="Don't know" responding to answerable and unanswerable questions during misleading and hypnotic interviews |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied |year=2008 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=255–65 |doi=10.1037/1076-898X.14.3.255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, misinformation effects can be minimized by tailoring individual interviews to the specific developmental stage, often based on age, of the participant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holliday |first=Robyn E. |author2=Albon, Amanda J. |title=Minimising misinformation effects in young children with cognitive interview mnemonics |journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology |year=2004 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=263–81 |doi=10.1002/acp.973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provoked versus spontaneous confabulations===
There is evidence to support different cognitive mechanisms for provoked and spontaneous confabulation.&lt;ref name="Provoked Versus Spontaneous"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schnider|first=Armin |author2=von Däniken, Christine |author3=Gutbrod, Klemens|title=The mechanisms of spontaneous and provoked confabulations|journal=Brain|date=19 February 1996|volume=119|issue=4|pages=1365–75|doi=10.1093/brain/119.4.1365}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study suggested that spontaneous confabulation may be a result of an amnesic patient’s inability to distinguish the chronological order of events in their memory. In contrast, provoked confabulation may be a compensatory mechanism, in which the patient tries to make up for their memory deficiency by attempting to demonstrate competency in recollection.

===Confidence in false memories===
Confabulation of events or situations may lead to an eventual acceptance of the confabulated information as true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pickel|first=Kerri|title=When a lie becomes the truth: The effects of self-generated misinformation on eyewitness memory|journal=Memory|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=14–26|doi=10.1080/09658210244000072|pmid=15098618}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, people who knowingly lie about a situation may eventually come to believe that their lies are truthful with time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polage|first=Danielle C.|title=Fabrication deflation? The mixed effects of lying on memory|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|issue=4|pages=455–65|doi=10.1002/acp.995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview setting, people are more likely to confabulate in situations in which they are presented false information by another person, as opposed to when they self-generate these falsehoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pezdek|first=Kathy|author2=Lam, Shirley T. |author3=Sperry, Kathryn |title=Forced confabulation more strongly influences event memory if suggestions are other-generated than self-generated|journal=Legal and Criminological Psychology|year=2009|volume=14|issue=2|pages=241–52|doi=10.1348/135532508X344773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, people are more likely to accept false information as true when they are interviewed at a later time (after the event in question) than those who are interviewed immediately or soon after the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melnyk|first=Laura|author2=Bruck, Maggie|title=Timing moderates the effects of repeated suggestive interviewing on children's eyewitness memory|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|issue=5|pages=613–31|doi=10.1002/acp.1013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmative feedback for confabulated responses is also shown to increase the confabulator’s confidence in their response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hafstad|first=Gertrud Sofie |author2=Memon, Amina |author3=Logie, Robert|title=Post-identification feedback, confidence and recollections of witnessing conditions in child witnesses|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|issue=7|pages=901–12|doi=10.1002/acp.1037}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in culprit identification, if a witness falsely identifies a member of a line-up, he will be more confident in his identification if the interviewer provides affirmative feedback. This effect of confirmatory feedback appears to last over time, as witnesses will even remember the confabulated information months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaragoza|first=M. S.|author2=Payment, K. E. |author3=Ackil, J. K. |author4=Drivdahl, S. B. |author5=Beck, M. |title=Interviewing Witnesses: Forced Confabulation and Confirmatory Feedback Increase False Memories|journal=Psychological Science|year=2001|volume=12|issue=6|pages=473–77|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00388|pmid=11760134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Among normal subjects===
On rare occasions, confabulation can also be seen in normal subjects.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt; It is currently unclear how completely healthy individuals produce confabulations. It is possible that these individuals are in the process of developing some type of organic condition that is causing their confabulation symptoms. It is not uncommon, however, for the general population to display some very mild symptoms of provoked confabulations. Subtle distortions and intrusions in memory are commonly produced by normal subjects when they remember something poorly.

==Diagnosis and treatment==
Spontaneous confabulations, due to their involuntary nature, cannot be manipulated in a laboratory setting.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; However, provoked confabulations can be researched in various theoretical contexts. The mechanisms found to underlie provoked confabulations can be applied to spontaneous confabulation mechanisms. The basic premise of researching confabulation comprises finding errors and distortions in memory tests of an individual.

===Deese–Roediger–McDermott lists===
Confabulations can be detected in the context of the [[Deese–Roediger–McDermott paradigm]] by using the Deese–Roediger–McDermott lists.&lt;ref name="True and False"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=Mark L. |author2=Cicchetti, Dante |author3=[[Sheree Toth|Toth, Sheree L.]] |author4=Cerrito, Beth M.|title=True and False Memories in Maltreated Children|journal=Child Development|date=1 September 2004|volume=75|issue=5|pages=1402–17|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00748.x|pmid=15369522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants listen to audio recordings of several lists of words centered around a theme, known as the critical word. The participants are later asked to recall the words on their list. If the participant recalls the critical word, which was never explicitly stated in the list, it is considered a confabulation. Participants often have a false memory for the critical word.

===Recognition tasks===
Confabulations can also be researched by using continuous recognition tasks.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; These tasks are often used in conjunction with confidence ratings. Generally, in a recognition task, participants are rapidly presented with pictures. Some of these pictures are shown once; others are shown multiple times. Participants press a key if they have seen the picture previously. Following a period of time, participants repeat the task. More errors on the second task, versus the first, are indicative of confusion, representing false memories.

===Free recall tasks===
Confabulations can also be detected using a free recall task, such as a self-narrative task.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; Participants are asked to recall stories ([[Semantic memory|semantic]] or [[Autobiographical memory|autobiographical]]) that are highly familiar to them. The stories recalled are encoded for errors that could be classified as distortions in memory. Distortions could include falsifying true story elements or including details from a completely different story. Errors such as these would be indicative of confabulations.

===Treatment===
Treatment for confabulation is somewhat dependent on the cause or source, if identifiable. For example, treatment of Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome involves large doses of vitamin B in order to reverse the thiamine deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3140893|year=2011|author1=Spiegel|first1=D. R.|title=A Case of Probable Korsakoff's Syndrome: A Syndrome of Frontal Lobe and Diencephalic Structural Pathogenesis and a Comparison with Medial Temporal Lobe Dementias|journal=Innovations in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=6|pages=15–19|last2=Lim|first2=K. J.|pmid=21779537}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no known physiological cause, more general cognitive techniques may be used to treat confabulation. A case study published in 2000 showed that [[Self-Monitoring Training]] (SMT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/096020100411998|title=Treatment of stable delusional confabulations using self-monitoring training|journal=Neuropsychological Rehabilitation|volume=10|issue=4|pages=415–27|year=2000|last1=Dayus|first1=B.|last2=Van Den Broek|first2=M.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduced delusional confabulations. Furthermore, improvements were maintained at a three-month follow-up and were found to generalize to everyday settings. Although this treatment seems promising, more rigorous research is necessary to determine the efficacy of SMT in the general confabulation population.

==Research==
Although significant gains have been made in the understanding of confabulation in recent years, there is still much to be learned. One group of researchers in particular has laid-out several important questions for future-study. They suggest more information is needed regarding the neural-systems that support the different cognitive processes necessary for normal source-monitoring. They also proposed the idea of developing a standard neuro-psychological test battery able to discriminate between the different types of confabulations. And there is a considerable amount of debate regarding the best approach to organizing and combining neuro-imaging, pharmacological, and cognitive/behavioral approaches to understand confabulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01152-8|pmid=21227110|title=False memories and confabulation|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=2|issue=4|pages=137–45|year=1998|last1=Johnson|first1=M|last2=Raye|first2=C. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent review article, another group of researchers contemplate issues concerning the distinctions between delusions and confabulation. They question whether delusions and confabulation should be considered distinct or overlapping disorders and, if overlapping, to what degree? They also discuss the role of unconscious processes in confabulation. Some researchers suggest that unconscious emotional and motivational processes are potentially just as important as cognitive and memory problems. Finally, they raise the question of where to draw the line between the pathological and the nonpathological. Delusion-like beliefs and confabulation-like fabrications are commonly seen in healthy individuals. What are the important differences between patients with similar etiology who do and do not confabulate? Since the line between pathological and nonpathological is likely blurry, should we take a more dimensional approach to confabulation? Research suggests that confabulation occurs along a continuum of implausibility, bizarreness, content, conviction, preoccupation, and distress, and impact on daily life.&lt;ref name=LangdonTurne2010&gt;{{citation |date=2010 |author1=Langdon, R.  |author2=Turner, M |title=Delusion and confabulation: Overlapping or distinct distortions in reality? |journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry |volume= 15 |issue=1 |pages= 1–13 |pmid=20043251|doi=10.1080/13546800903519095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8897">A '''coupled human–environment system''' (known also as a '''coupled human and natural system''', or '''CHANS''') characterizes the dynamical two-way interactions between human systems (e.g., economic, social) and natural (e.g., hydrologic, atmospheric, biological, geological) systems.&lt;ref&gt;  [https://www.nsf.gov/geo/ere/ereweb/fundlisting.cfm?09560946044805114F1D4B14474914  Environmental Resource and Education Funding Opportunities], National Science Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marina11"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1890/0012-9623-92.2.218 |title=Research on Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS): Approach, Challenges, and Strategies |journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=218–28 |year=2011 |last1=Alberti |first1=Marina |last2=Asbjornsen |first2=Heidi |last3=Baker |first3=Lawrence A |last4=Brozovic |first4=Nicholas |last5=Drinkwater |first5=Laurie E |last6=Drzyzga |first6=Scott A |last7=Jantz |first7=Claire A |last8=Fragoso |first8=José |last9=Holland |first9=Daniel S |last10=Kohler |first10=Timothy (Tim) A |last11=Liu |first11=Jianguo (Jack) |last12=McConnell |first12=William J |last13=Maschner |first13=Herbert D.

As CHANS research is relatively new, it has not yet matured into a coherent field. Some research programs draw from, and build on, the perspectives developed in trans-discplinary fields such as [[human ecology]], [[ecological anthropology]], [[environmental geography]], [[ecological economics|economics]], as well as others. In contrast, other research programs aim to develop a more quantitative theoretic framework focusing on the development of analytical and numerical models, by building on theoretical advances in [[complex adaptive systems]], [[complexity economics]], [[dynamical system]]s theory, and the [[earth science]]s. To some extent, all CHANS programs recognize the need to move beyond traditional research methods developed in the social and natural sciences, as these are not sufficient to quantify the highly nonlinear dynamics often present in CHANS. Some research into CHANS emulates the more traditional research programs that tended to separate the social from the ecological sciences.&lt;ref name="Liu07"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[639:chans]2.0.co;2 |jstor=25547831 |pmid=18240679 |title=Coupled Human and Natural Systems |journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=639–49 |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=Jianguo |last2=Dietz |first2=Thomas |last3=Carpenter |first3=Stephen R |last4=Folke |first4=Carl |last5=Alberti |first5=Marina |last6=Redman |first6=Charles L |last7=Schneider |first7=Stephen H |last8=Ostrom |first8=Elinor |last9=Pell |first9=Alice N |last10=Lubchenco |first10=Jane |last11=Taylor |first11=William W |last12=Ouyang |first12=Zhiyun |last13=Deadman |first13=Peter |last14=Kratz |first14=Timothy |last15=Provencher |first15=William }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu07b"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1144004 |pmid=17872436 |title=Complexity of Coupled Human and Natural Systems |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5844 |pages=1513–6 |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=J |last2=Dietz |first2=T |last3=Carpenter |first3=S.

==History==
The phrase "coupled human–environment systems" appears in the earlier literature (dating back to 1999) noting that social and natural systems are inseparable.&lt;ref name="Sheppard04"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Sheppard | editor1-first=E. | editor2-last=McMaster | editor2-first=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10410">'''Creative peacebuilding''' is the larger name for artist approaches to [[peacebuilding]] within individuals, groups, and societies. It includes various forms of [[art therapy]], whereby individuals and groups can express themselves to nurture healing and restoration. It is also used to overcome the recurrence of [[violence]], as a preventative measure to make the foundations of peace stronger, especially in contexts of war and conflict. Creating an environment of lasting peace is the primary goal of creative peacebuilding.

== War and conflict ==
According to [[Johan Galtung]], peacebuilding is the process of creating self-supporting structures that "remove causes of wars and offer alternatives to war in situations where wars might occur."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/2013/08/selected-definitions-of-peacebuilding/|title=Selected Definitions of Peacebuilding|work=Alliance for Peacebuilding|access-date=10 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[John Paul Lederach]], peacebuilding is a comprehensive concept that encompasses, generates, and sustains the full array of processes, approaches, and stages needed to transform conflict toward more sustainable, peaceful relationships, which involves a wide range of activities. It has a diverse range of interaction and involves various stakeholders in various levels within the spectrum of governance and development.&lt;ref name="Lederach2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UL8VDAAAQBAJ|title=The Moral Imagination: The Art and Soul of Building Peace|last=Lederach|first=John Paul|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-974758-0|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative peacebuilding facilitates the establishments of sustainable peace by preventing recurrence of violence, addresses the root causes, healing and effects of conflict, and offer alternatives to violence through reconciliation, economic and social transformation with the use of photography, film, painting, and the like. [[Jolyon Mitchell]] argues that the visual arts can both encourage peacebuilding and instigating violence. This is true of various forms of visual arts, ranging from posters, cartoons, and stained glass, to websites, radio, and films by reflecting on examples from around the world.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jLGcNb1_H1YC|title=Promoting Peace, Inciting Violence: The Role of Religion and Media|last=Mitchell|first=Jolyon P.|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-55746-7|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative peacebuilding can be especially powerful when used with those suffering from a young demographic and those with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. For at-risk youth, it lays the roots for a peaceful lifestyle and to help children who have already experienced trauma in their lives become fully functional adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ishaq|first=Ashfaq|date=December 2006|title=Development of children’s creativity to foster peace|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(06)69915-7/abstract|journal=The Lancet|volume=368|pages=26–27|via=|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69915-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art therapy==
Art therapy has been used to help rehabilitate [[child soldiers]] in [[Uganda]] as well as to help children who lost their homes in the [[tsunami]] of 2004 cope with their feelings. Many youth centers catering to impoverished children use art forms to build community, discipline and trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prutzman|first=Priscilla|date=October 1981|title=Children's Creative Response to Conflict|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0130.1981.tb00454.x|journal=Peace and Change|volume=7|issue=4|pages=77–79|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0130.1981.tb00454.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
[[Music therapy]] can be used in several different fashions to build peace. It can be used to help individuals express themselves or to foster communication between individuals or groups of people. It can be used to nurture healing and reconciliation. Music is something that transcends language and national or ethnic boundaries. It has unique styles depending on the community it originates in and can also be adapted to fit individual's tastes. When two groups who have been in conflict or have the potential for conflict make music together communication and healing become possible. When individuals listen to or play music, they can reduce their [[stress (biology)|stress]] levels and express their feelings.&lt;ref name="Sutton2002"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Z3jtH_qeIIC|title=Music, Music Therapy and Trauma: International Perspectives|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year=2002|isbn=978-1-84310-027-0|editor-last=Sutton|editor-first=Julie P.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual arts ===
Visual art therapy can be used to help individuals cope with their feelings resulting from violent experiences. It is also used to treat [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Art therapy is especially useful for people who are having trouble verbalizing their feelings and are keeping them bottled up. By sharing their experiences and processing them through a tactical and visual activity, people are able to heal. No prior experience with visual art is needed to participate in and gain benefits from art therapy—it is about the process of creation, not about the aesthetic appeal of the product. Art therapy can be used in group settings as well—creating a collaborative art project can be an experience that bridges differences between people and builds feelings of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avrahami|first=Dalia|date=2006|title=Visual Art Therapy's Unique Contribution in the Treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J229v06n04_02|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|volume=6|issue=4|pages=5–38|doi=10.1300/j229v06n04_02|issn=1529-9732|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visualization and technology ===
If people who have lived through traumatic or violent experiences can relive them and change the situation or their response to the situation they can come to terms with their past. Virtual technology and especially [[virtual reality]] simulations can be especially useful in cases like these and have been used to treat veterans of [[Iraq War|the Iraq war]] who are suffering from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. If the technology needed for these simulations is too expensive to be practical, mental [[Creative visualization|visualization]], in which the victim uses their imagination to create situations and feel as if they are gaining control of the way events play out, can be used as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/world/iraq/2007-06-18-iraq-virtual-reality_n.htm|title=Iraq vets use virtual reality to ease post-battle trauma|last=Jones|first=Brent|date=18 June 2007|website=www.usatoday.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Create Peace Project===
Create Peace Project is an arts-for-peace education organization working to promote the practices of peace and spread the message of hope and goodwill to children around the world using creativity. Create Peace Project was founded in San Francisco, California in 2007 by artist and peace activist Ross Holzman in response to the overwhelming amount of violence in the world, on the news, and in our communities. Violence, coupled with the lack of creativity in peoples lives sparked the creation of projects such as Banners for Peace and The Peace Exchange. Create Peace Project has included more than 25,000 children from around the world in its arts-for-peace projects since its inception and continues to work with schools in the US and beyond promoting peace through creativity to children of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.createpeaceproject.org|title=Create Peace Project|last=Holzman|first=Ross|date=8 May 2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barefoot artists===
Artist [[Lily Yeh]] has helped to heal the wounds [[genocide]] left on a village of widows and orphans through her work with Barefoot Artists. The members of the community were provided with a chance to honor their lost loved ones through their construction of a beautiful and expressive monument commemorating the mass grave of the local victims of the genocide. The construction process also provided a sense of closure to their mourning. Other aspects of the peacebuilding process in the village included paintings on building walls created by the village children of things that they hoped to see in the future as well as things important to their everyday existence. On the economic side of this peacebuilding effort, the people of the village learned how to mosaic and pour concrete, two useful and marketable skills to help provide economic stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://barefootartists.org/|title=Barefoot Artists|last=Yeh|first=Lily|date=|website=Barefoot Artists|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===River City Drum Corps===
In the United State, creative peacebuilding is used in many inner-city areas in places such as New York, Philadelphia, and Louisville. The River City Drum Corps in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, Ky]] provides a musical outlet for children who perhaps are not listened to in other parts of their lives. It is also a structured program where discipline and the importance of both uniqueness and teamwork are taught. The children learn drumming patterns and perform for different events and groups of people throughout the city. Both the children in the program and their audience benefit from the cultural exchange and communication that take place during drum corps performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rivercitydrumcorpky.com/rcdc/|title=About RCDC|last=|first=|date=|website=River City Drum Corp|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="107334">The '''deductive-nomological model''' ('''DN model'''), also known as '''[[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s model''', the '''Hempel–[[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] model''', the '''[[Karl Popper|Popper]]–Hempel model''', or the '''covering law model''', is a formal view of scientifically answering questions asking, "Why...?".  The DN model poses scientific explanation as a [[deductive inference|deductive]] structure—that is, one where truth of its premises entails truth of its conclusion—hinged on accurate prediction or [[postdiction]] of the phenomenon to be explained.

Because of problems concerning humans' ability to define, discover, and know [[causality]], it was omitted in initial formulations of the DN model. Causality was thought to be incidentally approximated by realistic selection of premises that ''derive'' the phenomenon of interest from observed starting conditions plus general [[scientific law|law]]s.  Still, DN model formally permitted causally irrelevant factors.  Also, derivability from observations and laws sometimes yielded absurd answers.

When [[logical empiricism]] fell out of favor in the 1960s, the DN model was widely seen as a flawed or greatly incomplete model of scientific explanation. Nonetheless, it  remained an idealized version of scientific explanation, and one that was rather accurate when applied to [[modern physics]].  In the early 1980s, revision to DN model emphasized ''maximal specificity'' for relevance of the conditions and [[axiom]]s stated.  Together with Hempel's [[inductive-statistical model]], the DN model forms scientific explanation's '''covering law model''', which is also termed, from critical angle, '''subsumption theory'''.

The term ''[[deductive inference|deductive]]'' distinguishes the DN model's intended [[determinism]] from the [[probabilism]] of [[inductive inference]]s.&lt;ref name=Woodward-DNmodel/&gt;  The term ''nomological'' is derived from the Greek word ''[[:wikt:νόμος|νόμος]]'' or ''nomos'', meaning "law".&lt;ref name=Woodward-DNmodel&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §2 "The DN model", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The DN model holds to a view of scientific explanation whose ''conditions of adequacy'' (CA)—semiformal but stated classically—are ''derivability'' (CA1), ''lawlikeness'' (CA2), ''empirical content'' (CA3), and ''truth'' (CA4).&lt;ref name=Fetzer-p113&gt;James Fetzer, ch 3 "The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation", in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA113 p 113].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the DN model, a law [[axiom]]atizes an [[enumerative induction|unrestricted generalization]] from antecedent ''A'' to consequent ''B'' by [[conditional sentence|conditional proposition]]—''If A, then B''—and has empirical content testable.&lt;ref&gt;Montuschi, ''Objects in Social Science'' (Continuum, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ24-BV8WSAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= pp 61–62].&lt;/ref&gt;  A law differs from mere true regularity—for instance, ''George always carries only $1 bills in his wallet''—by supporting [[counterfactual]] claims and thus suggesting what ''must'' be true,&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 2], subch "DN model of explanation and [[hypothetico-deductive model|HD model]] of theory development", pp 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt; while following from a scientific theory's axiomatic structure.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-axiomatic&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 2], subch "Axiomatic account of theories", pp 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon to be explained is the '''''explanandum'''''—an event, [[scientific law|law]], or [[scientific theory|theory]]—whereas the [[premise]]s to explain it are '''''explanans''''', true or highly confirmed, containing at least one universal law, and entailing the explanandum.&lt;ref name=Suppe&gt;Suppe, "Afterword—1977", "Introduction", §1 "Swan song for positivism", §1A "Explanation and intertheoretical reduction", [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC&amp;pg=PA619 pp 619–24], in Suppe, ed, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpvZsxCA0TIC ''Structure of Scientific Theories'', 2nd edn] (U Illinois P, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;  Thus, given the explanans as initial, specific conditions ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . . .

[[Aristotle]]'s scientific explanation in ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' resembles the DN model, an idealized form of scientific explanation.&lt;ref name=Shaffner&gt;Kenneth F Schaffner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ-z5oriurYC&amp;pg=PA79 "Explanation and causation in biomedical sciences"], pp 79–125, in Laudan, ed, ''Mind and Medicine'' (U California P, 1983), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ-z5oriurYC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq= p 81].&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework of [[Aristotelian physics]]—[[Aristotelian metaphysics]]—reflected the perspective of this principally biologist, who, amid living entities' undeniable purposiveness, formalized [[vitalism]] and [[teleology]], an intrinsic [[ethics|morality]] in nature.&lt;ref name=Montalenti&gt;G Montalenti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMAf65cDmAQC&amp;pg=PA3 ch 2 "From Aristotle to Democritus via Darwin"], in Ayala &amp; Dobzhansky, eds, ''Studies in the Philosophy of Biology'' (U California P, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  With emergence of [[Copernicanism]], however, [[René Descartes|Descartes]] introduced [[mechanical philosophy]], then [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] rigorously posed lawlike explanation, both Descartes and especially Newton shunning teleology within [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 17th century, Descartes as well as [[Isaac Newton]] firmly believed in God as nature's designer and thereby firmly believed in natural purposiveness, yet found [[teleology]] to be [[problem of demarcation|outside]] [[natural philosophy|science]]'s inquiry (Bolotin, ''Approach to Aristotle's Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLqB1IfeSZ0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq= pp 31–33]).  By 1650, formalizing [[heliocentrism]] and launching [[mechanical philosophy]], [[Cartesian physics]] overthrew geocentrism as well as Aristotelian physics.  In the 1660s, [[Robert Boyle]] sought to lift chemistry as a new discipline from alchemy.  Newton more especially sought the laws of nature—simply the regularities of phenomena—whereby [[Newtonian physics]], reducing celestial science to terrestrial science, ejected from physics the vestige of Aristotelian metaphysics, thus disconnecting physics and alchemy/chemistry, which then followed its own course, yielding chemistry around 1800.&lt;/ref&gt;  At 1740, [[David Hume]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicknames for principles attributed to Hume—[[Hume's fork]], [[problem of induction]], [[Hume's law]]—were not created by Hume but by later philosophers labeling them for ease of reference.&lt;/ref&gt; staked [[Hume's fork]],&lt;ref&gt;By Hume's fork, the truths of mathematics and logic as [[formal sciences]] are universal through "relations of ideas"—simply abstract truths—thus knowable [[a priori knowledge|without experience]].  On the other hand, the claimed truths of [[empirical science]]s are [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] on "fact and real existence", knowable only [[a posteriori|upon experience]].  By Hume's fork, the two categories never cross.  Any treatises containing neither can contain only "sophistry and illusion".  (Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume's fork", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq= p 156]).&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted the [[problem of induction]],&lt;ref&gt;Not privy to the world's either necessities or impossibilities, but by force of habit or mental nature, humans experience sequence of sensory events, find seeming [[constant conjunction]], make the unrestricted generalization of an [[enumerative induction]], and justify it by presuming [[uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]].  Humans thus attempt to justify a minor induction by adding a major induction, both logically invalid and unverified by experience—the [[problem of induction]]—how humans irrationally presume discovery of causality.  (Chakraborti, ''Logic'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2u8C_ur8VIC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq=uniformity+of+nature+problem+of+induction p 381]; Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq= p 156].&lt;/ref&gt; and found humans ignorant of either necessary or sufficient causality.&lt;ref&gt;For more discursive discussions of types of causality—necessary, sufficient, necessary and sufficient, component, sufficient component, [[counterfactual]]—see Rothman &amp; Greenland, Parascandola &amp; Weed, as well as Kundi.  Following is more direct elucidation:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A ''necessary cause'' is a causal condition ''required'' for an event to occur.  A ''sufficient cause'' is a causal condition ''complete'' to produce an event.  Necessary is not always sufficient, however, since other casual factors—that is, other ''component causes''—might be required to produce the event.  Conversely, a sufficient cause is not always a necessary cause, since differing sufficient causes might likewise produce the event.  Strictly speaking, a sufficient cause cannot be a single factor, as any causal factor must act casually through many other factors.  And although a necessary cause might exist, humans cannot verify one, since humans cannot check every possible state of affairs.  (Language can state necessary causality as a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—a statement whose terms' [[syntax|arrangement]] and [[semantics|meanings]] render it is logically true by mere definition—which, as an [[analytic-synthetic distinction|''analytic'' statement]], is uninformative about the actual world.  A statement referring to and contingent on the world's actualities is a [[analytic-synthetic distinction|''synthetic'' statement]], rather.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sufficient causality is more actually ''sufficient component causality''—a complete set of component causes interacting within a causal constellation—which, however, is beyond humans' capacity to fully discover.  Yet humans tend intuitively to conceive of causality as ''necessary and sufficient''—a single factor both required and complete—the one and only cause, ''the'' cause.  One may so view flipping a light switch.  The switch's flip was not sufficient cause, however, but contingent on countless factors—intact bulb, intact wiring, circuit box, bill payment, utility company, neighborhood infrastructure, engineering of technology by [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]], explanation of electricity by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], harnessing of electricity by [[Benjamin Franklin]], metal refining, metal mining, and on and on—while, whatever the tally of events, nature's causal mechanical structure remains a mystery.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From a [[David Hume|Humean]] perspective, the light's putative inability to come on without the switch's flip is neither a logical necessity nor an empirical finding, since no experience ever reveals that the world either is or will remain universally uniform as to the aspects appearing to bind the switch's flip as the necessary event for the light's coming on.  If the light comes on without switch flip, surprise will affect one's ''mind'', but one's mind cannot know that the event violated ''nature''.  As just a mundane possibility, an activity within the wall could have connected the wires and completed the circuit without the switch's flip.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Though apparently enjoying the scandals that trailed his own explanations, Hume was very practical and his skepticism was quite uneven (Flew [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=induction+scandal+sceptical+common+sense+logical+natural p 156]).  Although Hume rejected orthodox theism and sought to reject [[metaphysics]], Hume supposedly extended Newtonian method to the human mind, which Hume, in a sort of antiCopernican move, placed as the pivot of human knowledge (Flew [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=anti-Copernican p 154]).  Hume thus placed his own [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] on par with [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]] (Buckle [https://books.google.com/books?id=jiq14nexzu0C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Hume's+Newton+crowning#v=twopage pp 70–71], Redman [https://books.google.com/books?id=1faeMedY8k8C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=theism+moral+causal+induction#v=twopage pp 182–83], Schliesser [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/hume-newton § abstract]).  Hume found [[enumerative induction]] an unavoidable custom required for one to live (Gattei [https://books.google.com/books?id=oPPu1JvMBFoC&amp;pg=PA28#v=twopage pp 28–29]).  Hume found [[constant conjunction]] to reveal a modest causality type: ''[[counterfactual]] causality''.  Silent as to causal role—whether necessity, sufficiency, component strength, or mechanism—counterfactual causality is simply that alteration of a factor prevents or produces the event of interest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;  Hume also highlighted the [[Hume's law|fact/value gap]], as what ''is'' does not itself reveal what ''ought''.&lt;ref&gt;Hume noted that authors ubiquitously continue for some time stating facts and then suddenly switch to stating [[normative|norms]]—supposedly what should be—with barely explanation.  Yet such values, as in [[ethics]] or [[aesthetics]] or [[political philosophy]], are not found true merely by stating facts: ''is'' does not itself reveal ''ought''.  Hume's law is the principle that the fact/value gap is unbridgeable—that no statements of facts can ever justify norms—although Hume himself did not state that.  Rather, some later philosophers found Hume to merely stop short of stating it, but to have communicated it.  Anyway, Hume found that humans acquired morality through experience by [[communal reinforcement]].  (Flew, ''Dictionary'', "Hume's law", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=Hume's+law p 157] &amp; "Naturalistic fallacy", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=naturalistic+fallacy#v=twopage pp 240–41]; Wootton, ''Modern Political Thought'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=78eaIfCg2mcC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=Hume+communal+reinforcement p 306].)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Critique of Pure Reason|Near 1780]], countering Hume's ostensibly radical [[empiricism]], [[Immanuel Kant]] highlighted extreme [[rationalism]]—as by [[Descartes]] or [[Spinoza]]—and sought middle ground.  Inferring the mind to arrange experience of the world into ''substance'', ''space'', and ''time'', Kant placed the mind as part of the causal constellation of experience and thereby found [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]] universally true,&lt;ref&gt;
Kant inferred that the [[category (Kant)|mind's constants]] arrange space holding [[Euclidean geometry]]—like Newton's [[absolute space]]—while objects interact temporally as modeled in [[Newton's theory|Newton's theory of motion]], whose [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]] is a truth ''[[synthetic a priori]]'', that is, contingent on experience, indeed, but known universally true without universal experience.  Thus, the [[category (Kant)|mind's innate constants]] [[synthetic a priori|cross the tongs]] of [[Hume's fork]] and lay Newton's [[universal gravitation]] as ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' truth.&lt;/ref&gt; yet knowledge of [[ding-an-sich|things in themselves]] impossible.&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;  Safeguarding [[natural philosophy|science]], then, Kant paradoxically stripped it of [[scientific realism]].&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakravartty/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolotin-realism/&gt;  Aborting [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[inductivist]] mission to dissolve the veil of appearance to uncover the ''[[noumena]]''—[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view of nature's [[essentialism|ultimate truths]]—Kant's [[transcendental idealism]] tasked science with simply modeling patterns of ''[[phenomena]]''.  Safeguarding metaphysics, too, it found the [[category (Kant)|mind's constant]]s holding also [[categorical imperative|universal moral truths]],&lt;ref&gt;Whereas a [[hypothetical imperative]] is practical, simply what one ought to do if one seeks a particular outcome, the [[categorical imperative]] is morally universal, what everyone always ought to do.&lt;/ref&gt; and launched [[German idealism]], increasingly speculative.

[[Auguste Comte]] found the [[problem of induction]] rather irrelevant since [[enumerative induction]] is grounded on the empiricism available, while science's point is not metaphysical truth.  Comte found human knowledge had evolved from theological to metaphysical to scientific—the ultimate stage—rejecting both theology and metaphysics as asking questions unanswerable and posing answers unverifiable.  Comte in the 1830s expounded [[positivism]]—the first modern [[philosophy of science]] and simultaneously a [[political philosophy]]&lt;ref name=Bourdeau&gt;Bourdeau, "Auguste Comte", §§ "Abstract" &amp; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/#Int "Introduction"], in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;—rejecting conjectures about [[unobservable]]s, thus rejecting search for ''causes''.&lt;ref&gt;Comte, ''A General View of Positivism'' (Trübner, 1865), [https://books.google.com/books?id=59hUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=atheism+repudiated+causes+laws pp 49–50], including the following passage: "As long as men persist in attempting to answer the insoluble questions which occupied the attention of the childhood of our race, by far the more rational plan is to do as was done then, that is, simply to give free play to the imagination.  These spontaneous beliefs have gradually fallen into disuse, not because they have been disproved, but because humankind has become more enlightened as to its wants and the scope of its powers, and has gradually given an entirely new direction to its speculative efforts".&lt;/ref&gt;  Positivism predicts observations, confirms the predictions, and states a ''law'', thereupon [[applied science|applied]] to benefit human society.&lt;ref&gt;Flew, ''Dictionary'' (St Martin's, 1984), "Positivism", [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=positivism+prediction p 283].&lt;/ref&gt;  From late 19th century into the early 20th century, the influence of positivism spanned the globe.&lt;ref name=Bourdeau/&gt;  Meanwhile, evolutionary theory's [[natural selection]] brought the [[Copernican Revolution]] into biology and eventuated in the first conceptual alternative to [[vitalism]] and [[teleology]].&lt;ref name=Montalenti/&gt;

==Growth==

Whereas Comtean positivism posed science as ''description'', [[logical positivism]] emerged in the late 1920s and posed science as ''explanation'', perhaps to better [[unity of science|unify empirical sciences]] by covering not only [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—but [[special science]]s, too, such as biology, psychology, economics, and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §1 "Background and introduction", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  After defeat of [[National Socialism]] with World War II's close in 1945, logical positivism shifted to a milder variant, ''logical empiricism''.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii&gt;Friedman, ''Reconsidering Logical Positivism'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9TjZc9wNUAC&amp;pg=PR12 p xii].&lt;/ref&gt;  All variants of the movement, which lasted until 1965, are neopositivism,&lt;ref&gt;Any ''positivism'' placed in the 20th century is generally ''neo'', although there was [[Ernst Mach]]'s positivism nearing 1900, and a general positivistic approach to science—traceable to the [[inductivist]] trend from [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] at 1620, the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] [[research program]] at 1687, and [[Auguste Comte|Comptean]] positivism at 1830—that continues in a vague but usually disavowed sense within popular culture and some sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; sharing the quest of [[verificationism]].&lt;ref&gt;Neopositivists are sometimes called "verificationists".&lt;/ref&gt;

Neopositivists led emergence of the philosophy subdiscipline [[philosophy of science]], researching such questions and aspects of scientific theory and knowledge.&lt;ref name=Friedman-pxii/&gt;  [[Scientific realism]] takes scientific theory's statements at [[face value]], thus accorded either falsity or truth—probable or approximate or actual.&lt;ref name=Chakravartty&gt;Chakravartty, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §1.2 "The three dimensions of realist commitment", in ''SEP'', 2013: "Semantically, realism is committed to a literal interpretation of scientific claims about the world.  In common parlance, realists take theoretical statements at 'face value'.  According to realism, claims about scientific entities, processes, properties, and relations, whether they be observable or unobservable, should be construed literally as having truth values, whether true or false.  This semantic commitment contrasts primarily with those of so-called instrumentalist epistemologies of science, which interpret descriptions of unobservables simply as instruments for the prediction of observable phenomena, or for systematizing observation reports.  Traditionally, instrumentalism holds that claims about unobservable things have no literal meaning at all (though the term is often used more liberally in connection with some antirealist positions today).  Some antirealists contend that claims involving unobservables should not be interpreted literally, but as elliptical for corresponding claims about observables".&lt;/ref&gt;  Neopositivists held scientific antirealism as [[instrumentalism]], holding scientific theory as simply a device to predict observations and their course, while statements on nature's unobservable aspects are elliptical at or metaphorical of its observable aspects, rather.&lt;ref name=Chakravartty-Okasha&gt;
*Chakravartty, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §4 "Antirealism: Foils for scientific realism", §4.1 "Empiricism", in ''SEP'', 2013: "Traditionally, [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]]s maintain that terms for unobservables, by themselves, have no meaning; construed literally, statements involving them are not even candidates for truth or falsity.  The most influential advocates of [[instrumentalism]] were the [[logical empiricist]]s (or logical positivists), including [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] and [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]], famously associated with the [[Vienna Circle]] group of philosophers and scientists as well as important contributors elsewhere.  In order to rationalize the ubiquitous use of terms which might otherwise be taken to refer to unobservables in scientific discourse, they adopted a non-literal [[semantics]] according to which these terms acquire meaning by being associated with terms for observables (for example, '[[electron]]' might mean 'white streak in a [[cloud chamber]]'), or with demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view called '[[operationalism]]').  Insuperable difficulties with this semantics led ultimately (in large measure) to the demise of [[logical empiricism]] and the growth of [[scientific realism|realism]].  The contrast here is not merely in [[semantics]] and [[epistemology]]: a number of logical empiricists also held the [[neo-Kantian]] view that [[ontological]] questions 'external' to the frameworks for knowledge represented by theories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is made solely on [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] grounds), thereby rejecting the [[metaphysical]] dimension of [[scientific realism|realism]] (as in Carnap 1950)".
*Okasha, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Oxford U P, 2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2jCrzKYqxMC&amp;pg=PA62 p 62]: "Strictly we should distinguish two sorts of anti-realism.  According to the first sort, talk of unobservable entities is not to be understood literally at all.  So when a scientist pus forward a theory about electrons, for example, we should not take him to be asserting the existence of entities called 'electrons'.  Rather, his talk of electrons is metaphorical.  This form of anti-realism was popular in the first half of the 20th century, but few people advocate it today.  It was motivated largely by a doctrine in the philosophy of language, according to which it is not possible to make meaningful assertions about things that cannot in principle be observed, a doctrine that few contemporary philosophers accept.  The second sort of anti-realism accepts that talk of unobservable entities should be taken at face value: if a theory says that electrons are negatively charged, it is true if electrons do exist and are negatively charged, but false otherwise.  But we will never know which, says the anti-realist.  So the correct attitude towards the claims that scientists make about unobservable reality is one of total agnosticism.  They are either true or false, but we are incapable of finding out which.  Most modern anti-realism is of this second sort".&lt;/ref&gt;

DN model received its most detailed, influential statement by [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl G Hempel]], first in his 1942 article "The function of general laws in history", and more explicitly with [[Paul Oppenheim]] in their 1948 article "Studies in the logic of explanation".&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl G Hempel &amp; Paul Oppenheim, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/185169 "Studies in the logic of explanation"], ''Philosophy of Science'', 1948 Apr; '''15'''(2):135–175.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leading logical empiricist, Hempel embraced the [[David Hume|Humean]] empiricist view that humans observe sequence of sensory events, not cause and effect,&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt; as causal relations and casual mechanisms are unobservables.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;  DN model bypasses causality beyond mere [[constant conjunction]]: first an event like ''A'', then always an event like ''B''.&lt;ref name=Woodward-Background/&gt;

Hempel held [[natural laws]]—empirically confirmed regularities—as satisfactory, and if included realistically to approximate causality.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  In later articles, Hempel defended DN model and proposed probabilistic explanation by ''[[inductive-statistical model]]'' (IS model).&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  DN model and IS model—whereby the probability must be high, such as at least 50%&lt;ref name=Woodward-ISmodel/&gt;—together form ''covering law model'',&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt; as named by a critic, [[William Dray]].&lt;ref&gt;von Wright, ''Explanation and Understanding'' (Cornell U P, 1971), [https://books.google.com/books?id=33wCi2bg5x0C&amp;pg=PA11 p 11].&lt;/ref&gt;  Derivation of statistical laws from other statistical laws goes to the ''[[deductive-statistical model]]'' (DS model).&lt;ref name=Woodward-ISmodel&gt;Woodward, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation "Scientific explanation"], §2 "The DN model", §2.3 "Inductive statistical explanation", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glennan&gt;Stuart Glennan, "Explanation", § "Covering-law model of explanation", in Sarkar &amp; Pfeifer, eds, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Routledge, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq= p 276].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Georg Henrik von Wright]], another critic, named the totality ''subsumption theory''.&lt;ref name=Riedel&gt;Manfred Riedel, "Causal and historical explanation", in Manninen &amp; Tuomela, eds, ''Essays on Explanation and Understanding'' (D Reidel, 1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=It3ji_AuO3sC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Covering+subsumption pp 3–4].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==

Amid failure of [[neopositivism]]'s fundamental tenets,&lt;ref&gt;
Neopositivism's fundamental tenets were the verifiability criterion of ''cognitive meaningfulness'', the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic gap]], and the observation/theory gap.  From 1950 to 1951, Carl Gustav Hempel renounced the verifiability criterion.  In 1951 [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] attacked the analytic/synthetic gap.  In 1958, [[Norwood Russell Hanson]] blurred the observational/theoretical gap.  In 1959, [[Karl Raimund Popper]] attacked all of verificationism—he attacked, actually, any type of positivism—by asserting falsificationism.  In 1962, [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] overthrew [[foundationalism]], which was erroneously presumed to be a fundamental tenet of neopositivism.
&lt;/ref&gt; Hempel in 1965 abandoned verificationism, signaling neopositivism's demise.&lt;ref name=Fetzer-reFall&gt;
Fetzer, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/hempel "Carl Hempel"], §3 "Scientific reasoning", in ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|SEP]]'', 2013: "The need to dismantle the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness together with the demise of the observational/theoretical distinction meant that logical positivism no longer represented a rationally defensible position.  At least two of its defining tenets had been shown to be without merit.  Since most philosophers believed that Quine had shown the analytic/synthetic distinction was also untenable, moreover, many concluded that the enterprise had been a total failure.  Among the important benefits of Hempel's critique, however, was the production of more general and flexible criteria of ''cognitive significance'' in Hempel (1965b), included in a famous collection of his studies, ''Aspects of Scientific Explanation'' (1965d).  There he proposed that ''cognitive significance'' could not be adequately captured by means of principles of verification or falsification, whose defects were parallel, but instead required a far more subtle and nuanced approach.

Hempel suggested multiple criteria for assessing the ''cognitive significance'' of different theoretical systems, where significance is not categorical but rather a matter of degree: 'Significant systems range from those whose entire extralogical vocabulary consists of observation terms, through theories whose formulation relies heavily on theoretical constructs, on to systems with hardly any bearing on potential empirical findings' (Hempel 1965b: 117).  The criteria Hempel offered for evaluating the 'degrees of significance' of theoretical systems (as conjunctions of hypotheses, definitions, and auxiliary claims) were (a) the clarity and precision with which they are formulated, including explicit connections to observational language; (b) the systematic—explanatory and predictive—power of such a system, in relation to observable phenomena; (c) the formal simplicity of the systems with which a certain degree of systematic power is attained; and (d) the extent to which those systems have been confirmed by experimental evidence (Hempel 1965b).  The elegance of Hempel's study laid to rest any lingering aspirations for simple criteria of 'cognitive significance' and signaled the demise of logical positivism as a philosophical movement".
&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1930 onward, Karl Popper had refuted any positivism by asserting [[falsificationism]], which Popper claimed had killed positivism, although, paradoxically, Popper was commonly mistaken for a positivist.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;Popper, "Against big words", ''In Search of a Better World'' (Routledge, 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=L33XSZE77OkC&amp;pg=PA89#v=twopage pp 89-90].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hachoben&gt;Hacohen, ''Karl Popper: The Formative Years'' (Cambridge U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtHcYGp2pIC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=Habermas+broad+Popper+killed+logical+positivism#v=twopage pp 212–13].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even Popper's 1934 book&lt;ref&gt;''[[Logik der Forschung]]'', published in Austria in 1934, was translated by Popper from German to English, ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', and arrived in the [[English-speaking world]] in 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; embraces DN model,&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodward-introduction&gt;Woodward, "Scientific explanation", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/scientific-explanation abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; widely accepted as the model of scientific explanation for as long as physics remained the model of science examined by philosophers of science.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;

In the 1940s, filling the vast observational gap between cytology&lt;ref&gt;As scientific study of cells, cytology emerged in the 19th century, yet its technology and methods were insufficient to clearly visualize and establish existence of any cell [[organelle]]s beyond the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[biochemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;The first famed biochemistry experiment was [[Edward Buchner]]'s in 1897 (Morange, ''A History'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq= p 11]).  The biochemistry discipline soon emerged, initially investigating [[colloid]]s in biological systems, a "biocolloidology" (Morange [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12]; Bechtel, ''Discovering'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WrEquK3hoDwC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=biocolloidology+colloids+exemplifies+organic+proteins p 94]).  This yielded to macromolecular theory, the term ''macromolecule'' introduced by German chemist [[Hermann Staudinger]] in 1922 (Morange [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[cell biology]] arose&lt;ref&gt;Cell biology emerged principally at [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] through new technology ([[electron microscope]] and [[ultracentrifuge]]) and new techniques ([[cell fractionation]] and advancements in staining and fixation).&lt;/ref&gt; and established existence of cell [[organelle]]s besides the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].  Launched in the late 1930s, the [[molecular biology]] [[research program]] cracked a [[genetic code]] in the early 1960s and then converged with cell biology as ''cell and molecular biology'', its breakthroughs and discoveries defying DN model by arriving in quest not of lawlike explanation but of causal mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism&gt;Bechtel, ''Discovering Cell Mechanisms'' (Cambridge U P, 2006), esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=WrEquK3hoDwC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=empiricists+Salmon#v=twopage pp 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;  Biology became a new model of science, while [[special sciences]] were no longer thought defective by lacking universal laws, as borne by physics.&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;

In 1948, when explicating DN model and stating scientific explanation's semiformal ''conditions of adequacy'', [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim|Oppenheim]] acknowledged redundancy of the third, ''[[empiricism|empirical content]]'', implied by the other three—''derivability'', ''lawlikeness'', and ''truth''.&lt;ref name=Fetzer-p113/&gt;  In the early 1980s, upon widespread view that causality ensures the explanans' relevance, [[Wesley Salmon]] called for returning ''cause'' to ''because'',&lt;ref&gt;James Fetzer, ch 3 "The paradoxes of Hempelian explanation", in Fetzer J, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=causality pp 121–122].&lt;/ref&gt; and along with [[James H. Fetzer|James Fetzer]] helped replace CA3 ''empirical content'' with CA3' ''strict maximal specificity''.&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, ch 3 in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=better p 129].&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon introduced ''causal mechanical'' explanation, never clarifying how it proceeds, yet reviving philosophers' interest in such.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-mechanism/&gt;  Via shortcomings of Hempel's inductive-statistical model (IS model), Salmon introduced ''[[statistical-relevance model]]'' (SR model).&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt;  Although DN model remained an idealized form of scientific explanation, especially in [[applied science]]s,&lt;ref name=Shaffner/&gt; most philosophers of science consider DN model flawed by excluding many types of explanations generally accepted as scientific.&lt;ref name=Glennan/&gt;

==Strengths==

As theory of knowledge, [[epistemology]] differs from [[ontology]], which is a subbranch of [[metaphysics]], theory of reality.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-metaphysics-epistemology/&gt;  Ontology poses which categories of being—what sorts of things exist—and so, although a scientific theory's ontological commitment can be modified in light of experience, an ontological commitment inevitably precedes empirical inquiry.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-metaphysics-epistemology&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 1], subch "Areas of philosophy that bear on philosophy of science", § "Metaphysics", pp 8–9, § "Epistemology", p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural law]]s, so called, are statements of humans' observations, thus are epistemological—concerning human knowledge—the ''[[epistemic]]''.  Causal mechanisms and structures existing putatively independently of minds exist, or would exist, in the natural world's structure itself, and thus are ontological, the ''[[ontic]]''. Blurring epistemic with ontic—as by incautiously presuming a natural law to refer to a causal mechanism, or to trace structures realistically during unobserved transitions, or to be true regularities always unvarying—tends to generate a ''[[category mistake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;H Atmanspacher, R C Bishop &amp; A Amann, "Extrinsic and intrinsic irreversibility in probabilistic dynamical laws", in Khrennikov, ed, ''Proceedings'' (World Scientific, 2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=9B6b5WKuNWwC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=ontic+epistemic+general pp 51–52].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, ch 3, in Fetzer, ed, ''Science, Explanation, and Rationality'' (Oxford U P, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvctcrj08wAC&amp;pg=PA118 p 118], poses some possible ways that natural laws, so called, when [[epistemic]] can fail as [[ontic]]: "The underlying conception is that of bringing order to our ''knowledge'' of the universe.  Yet there are at least three reasons why even complete knowledge of every empirical regularity that obtains during the world's history might not afford an adequate inferential foundation for discovery of the world's laws.  First, some laws might remain uninstantiated and therefore not be displayed by any regularity.  Second, some regularities may be accidental and therefore not display any law of nature.  And, third, in the case of probabilistic laws, some frequencies might deviate from their generating nomic probabilities 'by chance' and therefore display natural laws in ways that are unrepresentative or biased".&lt;/ref&gt;

Discarding ontic commitments, including causality ''per se'', DN model permits a theory's laws to be reduced to—that is, subsumed by—a more fundamental theory's laws.  The higher theory's laws are explained in DN model by the lower theory's laws.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-axiomatic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  Thus, the epistemic success of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]ian theory's [[law of universal gravitation]] is reduced to—thus explained by—[[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], although Einstein's discards Newton's ontic claim that universal gravitation's epistemic success predicting [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]&lt;ref&gt;This theory reduction occurs if, and apparently only if, the Sun and one planet are modeled as a two-body system, excluding all other planets (Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P60&amp;dq= pp 60–62]).&lt;/ref&gt; is through a causal mechanism of a straightly attractive force instantly traversing [[absolute space]] despite [[absolute time]].

Covering law model reflects [[neopositivism]]'s vision of [[empirical science]], a vision interpreting or presuming [[unity of science]], whereby all empirical sciences are either [[fundamental science]]—that is, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—or are [[special sciences]], whether [[astrophysics]], chemistry, biology, [[geology]], psychology, economics, and so on.&lt;ref name=cplaws&gt;Reutlinger, Schurz &amp; Hüttemann, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/ceteris-paribus "Ceteris paribus"], § 1.1 "Systematic introduction", in Zalta, ed, ''SEP'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spohn, ''Laws of Belief'' (Oxford U P, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MSXrFBvIZIUC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=fundamental+special+sciences p 305].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whereas fundamental physics has sought [[scientific law|law]]s of [[determinism|universal regularity]], special sciences normally include ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' laws, which are predictively accurate to high [[probability]] in "normal conditions" or with "all else equal", but have exceptions [Reutlinger ''et al'' § 1.1].  Chemistry's laws seem [[deterministic|exceptionless]] in their domains, yet were in principle reduced to fundamental physics [Feynman [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=chemistry p 5], Schwarz [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9501161 Fig 1], and so are special sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;  All special sciences would network via covering law model.&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch "Introduction: Relating disciplines by relating theories" pp 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  And by stating ''boundary conditions'' while supplying ''bridge laws'', any special law would reduce to a lower special law, ultimately reducing—theoretically although generally not practically—to fundamental science.&lt;ref name=Bechtel-TheoryReduction&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), ch 5, subch "Theory reduction model and the [[unity of science]] program" pp 72–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bem-Long/&gt;  (''Boundary conditions'' are specified conditions whereby the phenomena of interest occur.  ''Bridge laws'' translate terms in one science to terms in another science.)&lt;ref name=Bechtel-TheoryReduction/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bem-Long&gt;Bem &amp; de Jong, ''Theoretical Issues'' (Sage, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DgDGJi2F2vsC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=deductive-nomological+boundary+conditions+bridge+laws pp 45–47].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaknesses==

By DN model, if one asks, "Why is that shadow 20 feet long?", another can answer, "Because that flagpole is 15 feet tall, the Sun is at ''x'' angle, and laws of [[electromagnetism]]".&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  Yet by problem of symmetry, if one instead asked, "Why is that flagpole 15 feet tall?", another could answer, "Because that shadow is 20 feet long, the Sun is at ''x'' angle, and laws of electromagnetism", likewise a deduction from observed conditions and scientific laws, but an answer clearly incorrect.&lt;ref name=Suppe/&gt;  By the problem of irrelevance, if one asks, "Why did that man not get pregnant?", one could in part answer, among the explanans, "Because he took birth control pills"—if he factually took them, and the law of their preventing pregnancy—as covering law model poses no restriction to bar that observation from the explanans.

Many [[philosophy of science|philosophers]] have concluded that causality is integral to scientific explanation.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy&gt;O'Shaughnessy, ''Explaining Buyer Behavior'' (Oxford U P, 1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=magj7kNrbpsC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq= pp 17–19].&lt;/ref&gt;  DN model offers a necessary condition of a causal explanation—successful prediction—but not sufficient conditions of causal explanation, as a universal regularity can include spurious relations or simple correlations, for instance ''Z'' always following ''Y'', but not ''Z'' because of ''Y'', instead ''Y'' and then ''Z'' as an effect of ''X''.&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;  By relating temperature, pressure, and volume of gas within a container, [[Boyle's law]] permits prediction of an unknown variable—volume, pressure, or temperature—but does not explain ''why'' to expect that unless one adds, perhaps, the [[kinetic theory of gases]].&lt;ref name=OShaughnessy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spohn-idealgas/&gt;

Scientific explanations increasingly pose not [[determinism]]'s universal laws, but [[probabilism]]'s chance,&lt;ref name=Karhausen/&gt; ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' laws.&lt;ref name=cplaws/&gt;  Smoking's contribution to [[lung cancer]] fails even the inductive-statistical model (IS model), requiring probability over 0.5 (50%).&lt;ref&gt;Bechtel, ''Philosophy of Science'' (Lawrence Erlbaum, 1988), [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/research/philosophyofscience.html ch 3], subch "Repudiation of DN model of explanation", pp 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Probability standardly ranges from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%).)  An [[applied science]] that applies [[statistics]] seeking associations between events, [[epidemiology]] cannot show causality, but consistently found higher incidence of lung cancer in smokers versus otherwise similar nonsmokers, although the proportion of smokers who develop lung cancer is modest.&lt;ref name=Rothman-Greenland&gt;{{Cite journal

==Covering action==

Through lawlike explanation, [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]]—often perceived as [[fundamental science]]—has proceeded through intertheory relation and theory reduction, thereby resolving experimental [[paradox]]es to great historical success,&lt;ref name=Schwarz&gt;Schwarz, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9501161 "Recent developments in string theory"], ''Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A'', 1998; '''95''':2750–7, esp [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC19640/figure/F1 Fig 1].&lt;/ref&gt; resembling covering law model.&lt;ref name=Ben-Menahem&gt;Ben-Menahem, ''Conventionalism'' (Cambridge U P, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bgRA2LOjcMAC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=mechanical+deductive-nomological+model+ether p 71].&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 20th century, [[Ernst Mach]] as well as [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] had resisted [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s reduction of [[thermodynamics]]—and thereby [[Boyle's law]]&lt;ref&gt;Instances of falsity limited Boyle's law to special cases, thus [[ideal gas law]].&lt;/ref&gt;—to [[statistical mechanics]] partly ''because'' it rested on [[kinetic theory of gas]],&lt;ref name=Spohn-idealgas&gt;Spohn, ''Laws of Belief'' (Oxford U P, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MSXrFBvIZIUC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=gas p 306].&lt;/ref&gt; hinging on [[atomic theory of matter|atomic/molecular theory of matter]].&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Mach as well as Ostwald viewed matter as a variant of energy, and molecules as mathematical illusions,&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl&gt;Newburgh ''et al'', [http://physlab.lums.edu.pk/images/f/fe/Ref1.pdf "Einstein, Perrin, and the reality of atoms"], ''Am J Phys'', 2006, p 478.&lt;/ref&gt; as even Boltzmann thought possible.&lt;ref name=Kuhn-Frank&gt;For brief review of Boltmann's view, see ch 3 "Philipp Frank", § 1 "[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|T S Kuhn]]'s interview", in Blackmore ''et al'', eds, ''Ernst Mach's Vienna 1895–1930'' (Kluwer, 2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCfk8tZix6oC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=Mach+Boltzmann+atoms p 63], as Frank was a student of Boltzmann soon after Mach's retirement. See "Notes", [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCfk8tZix6oC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=atomism pp 79–80], #12 for views of Mach and of Ostwald, #13 for views of contemporary physicists generally, and #14 for views of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].  The more relevant here is #12: "Mach seems to have had several closely related opinions concerning [[atomism]].  First, he often thought the theory might be useful in physics as long as one did not believe in the [[scientific realism|reality]] of atoms.  Second, he believed it was difficult to apply the atomic theory to both psychology and physics.  Third, his own theory of elements is often called an 'atomistic theory' in psychology in contrast with both gestalt theory and a continuum theory of experience.  Fourth, when critical of the reality of atoms, he normally meant the Greek sense of 'indivisible substance' and thought Boltzmann was being evasive by advocating divisible atoms or 'corpuscles' such as would become normal after [[J J Thomson]] and the distinction between [[electron]]s and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]].  Fifth, he normally called physical atoms 'things of thought' and was very happy when Ostwald seemed to refute the reality of atoms in 1905.  And sixth, after Ostwald returned to atomism in 1908, Mach continued to defend Ostwald's 'energeticist' alternative to atomism".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, via statistical mechanics, [[Albert Einstein]] predicted the phenomenon [[Brownian motion]]—unexplained since reported in 1827 by botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]].&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Soon, most physicists accepted that atoms and molecules were unobservable yet real.&lt;ref name=NewburghEtAl/&gt;  Also in 1905, Einstein explained the electromagnetic field's energy as distributed in ''particles'', doubted until this helped resolve [[atomic theory]] in the 1910s and 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;
Physicists had explained the electromagnetic field's energy as ''mechanical'' energy, like an ocean wave's bodily impact, not water droplets individually showered (Grandy, ''Everyday Quantum Reality'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-Tmtb-XvwcC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq= pp 22–23]).  In the 1890s, the problem of [[blackbody radiation]] was paradoxical until [[Max Planck]] theorized ''[[quantum]]'' exhibiting [[Planck's constant]]—a minimum unit of energy.  The quanta were mysterious, not viewed as ''particles'', yet simply as units of ''energy''.  Another paradox, however, was the [[photoelectric effect]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As shorter wavelength yields more waves per unit distance, lower wavelength is higher wave frequency.  Within the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]'s visible portion, frequency sets the color.  Light's intensity, however, is the wave's amplitude as the wave's height.  In a strictly wave explanation, a greater intensity—higher wave amplitude—raises the mechanical energy delivered, namely, the wave's impact, and thereby yields greater physical effect.  And yet in the photoelectric effect, only a certain color and beyond—a certain frequency and higher—was found to knock electrons off a metal surface. Below that frequency or color, raising the intensity of the light still knocked no electrons off.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Einstein modeled Planck's quanta as each a particle whose individual energy was Planck's constant multiplied by the light's wave's frequency: at only a certain frequency and beyond would each particle be energetic enough to eject an electron from its orbital.  Although elevating the intensity of light would deliver more energy—more total particles—each individual particle would still lack sufficient energy to dislodge an electron.  Einstein's model, far more intricate, used [[probability theory]] to explain rates of elections ejections as rates of collisions with electromagnetic particles.  This revival of the [[particle theory of light|particle hypothesis of light]]—generally attributed to Newton—was widely doubted.  By 1920, however, the explanation helped solve problems in [[atomic theory]], and thus [[quantum mechanics]] emerged.  In 1926, [[Gilbert N Lewis]] termed the particles ''[[photon]]s''.  [[quantum electrodynamics|QED]] models them as the electromagnetic field's [[messenger particle]]s or force carriers, emitted and absorbed by electrons and by other particles undergoing transitions.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, all known physical phenomena were gravitational or [[timeline of electromagnetic theory|electromagnetic]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, ''Simply Einstein'' (W W Norton &amp; Co, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FwNJ_PDRnbkC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Wrap p 67].&lt;/ref&gt; whose two theories misaligned.&lt;ref&gt;Newton's gravitational theory at 1687 had postulated [[absolute space and time|absolute space and absolute time]].  To fit [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]]'s [[transverse wave]] theory of light at 1804, space was theoretically filled with [[Augustin Fresnel|Fresnel]]'s [[luminiferous aether]] at 1814.  By [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s electromagnetic field theory of 1865, light always holds a constant speed, which, however, must be relative to something, apparently to aether.  Yet if light's speed is constant relative to aether, then a body's motion through aether would be relative to—thus vary in relation to—light's speed.  Even Earth's vast speed, multiplied by experimental ingenuity with an [[interferometer]] by [[Michelson–Morley experiment|Michelson &amp; Morley at 1887]], revealed no apparent ''aether drift''—light speed apparently constant, an absolute.  Thus, both Newton's gravitational theory and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory each had its own relativity principle, yet the two were incompatible.  For brief summary, see Wilczek, ''Lightness of Being'' (Basic Books, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iWhxK12fbA4C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq= pp 78–80].&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet belief in aether as the source of all physical phenomena was virtually unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;Cordero, ''EPSA Philosophy of Science'' (Springer, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e0B_VtFeSi4C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=ether pp 26–28].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, ''Aether and Gravitation'' (Chapman &amp; Hall, 1903), [https://books.google.com/books?id=cgoQAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Aether pp 122–23].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lodge&gt;Lodge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FgYiAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=action+constitute+distance+electron+empty+space+gravitation+Optical "The ether of space"], ''Sci Am Suppl'', 1909; '''67''':202–03.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Even Mach, who shunned all hypotheses beyond direct sensory experience, presumed an aether, required for motion to not violate [[mechanical philosophy]]'s founding principle, ''No instant inter[[action at a distance]]'' (Einstein, "Ether", ''Sidelights'' (Methuen, 1922), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vwZlfF3sVJEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA617&amp;dq=special pp 15–18]).&lt;/ref&gt;  At experimental paradoxes,&lt;ref&gt;
Rowlands, ''Oliver Lodge'' (Liverpool U P, 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7BfLxqkSgBEC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq= pp 159–60]: "[[Sir Oliver Lodge|Lodge]]'s [[luminiferous aether|ether]] experiments have become part of the historical background leading up to the establishment of [[special relativity]] and their significance is usually seen in this context.  Special relativity, it is stated, eliminated both the ether and the concept of absolute motion from physics.  Two experiments were involved: that of Michelson and Morley, which showed that bodies do not move with respect to a stationary ether, and that of Lodge, which showed that moving bodies do not drag ether with them.  With the emphasis on relativity, the [[Michelson–Morley]] experiment has come to be seen as the more significant of the two, and Lodge's experiment becomes something of a detail, a matter of eliminating the final, and less likely, possibility of a nonstationary, viscous, all-pervading medium.

It could be argued that almost the exact opposite may have been the case.  The Michelson–Morley experiment did not prove that there was no absolute motion, and it did not prove that there was no stationary ether.  Its results—and the [[FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction]]—could have been predicted on [[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]]'s, or even [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s, theory, even if no experiment had ever taken place.  The significance of the experiment, though considerable, is purely historical, and in no way factual.  Lodge's experiment, on the other hand, showed that, if an ether existed, then its properties must be quite different from those imagined by mechanistic theorists.

Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]] confusingly talked of ''[[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]]s'' acting on ''[[quantum state]]s''. [[Richard Feynman]] introduced QM's [[path integral formulation|path integral]] formalism—interpretable as a particle traveling all paths imaginable, canceling themselves, leaving just one, the most efficient—predictively identical with Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics|matrix]] formalism and with Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger's equation|wave]] formalism.&lt;/ref&gt; the two theories made identical predictions.&lt;ref name=QMformalisms/&gt;  [[Paul Dirac]]'s 1928 [[Dirac equation|model of the electron]] was set to [[special relativity]], launching [[quantum mechanics|QM]] into the first [[quantum field theory]] (QFT), [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).&lt;ref name=Torretti-p393-95&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P393&amp;dq= pp 393–95].&lt;/ref&gt;  From it, Dirac interpreted and predicted the electron's [[antiparticle]], soon discovered and termed ''[[positron]]'',&lt;ref name=Torretti-p394&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P394&amp;dq= p 394].&lt;/ref&gt; but the QED failed electrodynamics at high energies.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395/&gt;  Elsewhere and otherwise, [[strong nuclear force]] and [[weak nuclear force]] were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Recognition of strong force permitted [[Manhattan Project]] to engineer [[Little Boy]] and [[Fat Man]], dropped on Japan, whereas effects of weak force were seen in its aftermath—[[radioactive fallout]]—of diverse health consequences.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, [[Richard Feynman]] introduced QM's [[path integral formulation|path integral]] formalism, which if taken toward ''interpretation'' as a causal mechanical model clashes with Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics|matrix]] formalism and with Schrödinger's [[Schrödinger's equation|wave]] formalism,&lt;ref name=QMs/&gt; although all three are empirically identical, sharing predictions.&lt;ref name=QMformalisms&gt;From 1925 to 1926, independently but nearly simultaneously, [[Werner Heisenberg]] as well as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] developed quantum mechanics (Zee in Feynman, ''QED'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq= p xiv]).  Schrödinger introduced [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]], whose [[wave function]] is discerned by a [[partial differential equation]], now termed ''[[Schrödinger equation]]'' (p xiv).  Heisenberg, who also stated the [[uncertainty principle]], along with [[Max Born]] and [[Pascual Jordan]] introduced [[matrix mechanics]], which rather confusingly talked of ''[[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]]s'' acting on ''[[quantum state]]s'' (p xiv).  If taken as causal mechanically [[explanatory]], the two formalisms vividly disagree, and yet are indiscernible [[empirically]], that is, when not used for ''interpretation'', and taken as simply ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]'' ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq= p xv]).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1941, at a party in a tavern in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], visiting physicist Herbert Jehle mentioned to [[Richard Feynman]] a different formalism suggested by [[Paul Dirac]], who developed [[bra–ket notation]], in 1932 (p xv).  The next day, Feynman completed Dirac's suggested approach as ''[[sum over histories]]'' or ''[[sum over paths]]'' or ''[[path integral formulation|path integrals]]'' (p xv).  Feynman would joke that this approach—which sums all possible paths that a particle could take, as though the particle actually takes them all, canceling themselves out except for one pathway, the particle's most efficient—abolishes the uncertainty principle ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq= p xvi]).  All empirically equivalent, Schrödinger's wave formalism, Heisenberg's matrix formalism, and Feynman's path integral formalism all incorporate the uncertain principle (p xvi).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is no particular barrier to additional formalisms, which could be, simply have not been, developed and widely disseminated ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq= p xvii]).  In a particular physical discipline, however, and on a particular problem, one of the three formalisms might be easier than others to operate ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq= pp xvi–xvii]).  By the 1960s, path integral formalism virtually vanished from use, while matrix formalism was the "canonical" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq= p xvii]).  In the 1970s, path integral formalism made a "roaring comeback", became the predominant means to make predictions from [[quantum field theory|QFT]], and impelled Feynman to an aura of mystique ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq= p xviii]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, working on QED, Feynman sought to model particles without fields and find the vacuum truly empty.&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt;  As each known [[fundamental force]]&lt;ref&gt;The four, known [[fundamental interactions]] are gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear.&lt;/ref&gt; is apparently an effect of a field, Feynman failed.&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt;  [[Louis de Broglie]]'s [[waveparticle duality]] had rendered [[atomism]]—indivisible particles in a void—untenable, and highlighted the very notion of discontinuous particles as selfcontradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Grandy, ''Everyday Quantum Reality'' (Indiana U P, 2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-Tmtb-XvwcC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq= pp 24–25].&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeting in 1947, [[Freeman Dyson]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Julian Schwinger]], and [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] soon introduced ''[[renormalization]]'', a procedure converting QED to physics' most predictively precise theory,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P395&amp;dq= p 395].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schweber&gt;Schweber, [https://books.google.com/books/about/QED_and_the_Men_who_Made_it.html?id=61n5dE7FJQgC ''QED and the Men who Made it''] (Princeton U P, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; subsuming [[chemistry]], [[optics]], and [[statistical mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;Feynman, ''QED'' (Princeton U P, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv-uxB0sRKEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=chemistry p 5].&lt;/ref&gt;  QED thus won physicists' general acceptance.&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96/&gt;  [[Paul Dirac]] criticized its need for renormalization as showing its unnaturalness,&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96&gt;Torretti, ''Philosophy of Physics'', (Cambridge U P, 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=P395&amp;dq=Dirac pp 395–96].&lt;/ref&gt; and called for an aether.&lt;ref name=Cushing-p158-59&gt;Cushing, ''Quantum Mechanics'' (U Chicago P, 1994), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTewHaL8fvgC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=ether+Dirac+medium+vacuum#v=twopage pp 158–59].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1947, [[Willis Lamb]] had found unexpected motion of [[electron configuration|electron orbitals]], [[Lamb shift|shift]]ed since the vacuum is not truly empty.&lt;ref&gt;Close, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/blog/tag/ether "Much ado about nothing"], ''Nova'', PBS/WGBH, 2012:

"This new quantum mechanical view of nothing began to emerge in 1947, when [[Willis Lamb]] measured spectrum of hydrogen.  The electron in a hydrogen atom cannot move wherever it pleases but instead is restricted to specific paths.  This is analogous to climbing a ladder: You cannot end up at arbitrary heights above ground, only those where there are rungs to stand on.  Quantum mechanics explains the spacing of the rungs on the atomic ladder and predicts the frequencies of radiation that are emitted or absorbed when an electron switches from one to another.  According to the state of the art in 1947, which assumed the hydrogen atom to consist of just an electron, a proton, and an electric field, two of these rungs have identical energy. However, Lamb's measurements showed that these two rungs differ in energy by about one part in a million.  What could be causing this tiny but significant difference?

"When physicists drew up their simple picture of the atom, they had forgotten something: Nothing.  Lamb had become the first person to observe experimentally that the vacuum is not empty, but is instead seething with ephemeral electrons and their anti-matter analogues, positrons.  These electrons and positrons disappear almost instantaneously, but in their brief mayfly moment of existence they alter the shape of the atom's electromagnetic field slightly.  This momentary interaction with the electron inside the hydrogen atom kicks one of the rungs of the ladder just a bit higher than it would be otherwise.
&lt;br&gt;
"This is all possible because, in quantum mechanics, energy is not conserved on very short timescales, or for very short distances.  Stranger still, the more precisely you attempt to look at something—or at nothing—the more dramatic these energy fluctuations become.  Combine that with Einstein's E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which implies that energy can congeal in material form, and you have a recipe for particles that bubble in and out of existence even in the void.  This effect allowed Lamb to literally measure something from nothing".&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet ''emptiness'' was catchy, abolishing aether conceptually, and physics proceeded ostensibly without it,&lt;ref name=Wilczek1999p13/&gt; even suppressing it.&lt;ref name=Cushing-p158-59/&gt;  Meanwhile, "sickened by untidy math, most [[philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] tend to neglect QED".&lt;ref name=Torretti-p395-96/&gt;

According to this theory, light consists of wave-like vibrations in an invisible medium called the ether, which was supposed to permeate the whole universe.  (The rival to the wave theory was the particle theory of light, favoured by Newton, which held that light consists of very small particles emitted by the light source.)  The wave theory was not widely accepted until the French physicist Auguste Fresnel formulated a mathematical version of the theory in 1815, and used it to predict some surprising new optical phenomena.  Optical experiments confirmed Fresnel's predictions, convincing many 19th-century scientists that the wave theory of light must be true.  But modern physics tells us that the theory is not true: there is no such thing as the ether, so light doesn't consist of vibrations in it.

It was Einstein's special theory of relativity, proposed in 1905, that did away with the necessity of aether, and the concept has been relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since.

It turns out that such matter exists.  About the time that relativity was becoming accepted, studies of radioactivity began showing that the empty vacuum of space had spectroscopic structure similar to that of ordinary quantum solids and fluids.  Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness.  It is filled with 'stuff' that is normally transparent but can be made visible by hitting it sufficiently hard to knock out a part.

(Whittaker, ''A History of Theories of Aether'' (Longmans, Green &amp; Co: 1910), [https://archive.org/stream/historyoftheorie00whitrich#page/18/mode/2up pp 17–18])&lt;/ref&gt;  By now, most [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]] infer that the four, known [[fundamental interactions]] would reduce to [[superstring theory]], whereby atoms and molecules, after all, are energy vibrations holding mathematical, geometric forms.&lt;ref name=Schwarz/&gt;  Given uncertainties of [[scientific realism]],&lt;ref name=Bolotin-realism&gt;Challenges to [[scientific realism]] are captured succinctly by Bolotin, ''Approach to Aristotle's Physics'' (SUNY P, 1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LLqB1IfeSZ0C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq= pp 33–34], commenting about modern science, "But it has not succeeded, of course, in encompassing all phenomena, at least not yet.  For it laws are mathematical idealizations, idealizations, moreover, with no immediate basis in experience and with no evident connection to the ultimate causes of the natural world.  For instance, [[Newton's first law of motion]] (the law of inertia) requires us to imagine a body that is always at rest or else moving aimlessly in a straight line at a constant speed, even though we never see such a body, and even though according to his own theory of universal gravitation, it is impossible that there can be one.  This fundamental law, then, which begins with a claim about what would happen in a situation that never exists, carries no conviction except insofar as it helps to predict observable events.  Thus, despite the amazing success of Newton's laws in predicting the observed positions of the planets and other bodies, Einstein and Infeld are correct to say, in ''[[The Evolution of Physics]]'', that 'we can well imagine another system, based on different assumptions, might work just as well'.  Einstein and Infeld go on to assert that 'physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world'.  To illustrate what they mean by this assertion, they compare the modern scientist to a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch.  If he is ingenious, they acknowledge, this man 'may form some picture of a mechanism which would be responsible for all the things he observes'.  But they add that he 'may never quite be sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations.  He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison'.  In other words, modern science cannot claim, and it will never be able to claim, that it has the definite understanding of any natural phenomenon".&lt;/ref&gt; some conclude that the concept ''causality'' raises comprehensibility of scientific explanation and thus is key [[folk science]], but compromises precision of scientific explanation and is dropped as a science matures.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, [http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/003004.pdf "Causation as folk science"], in Price &amp; Corry, eds, ''Mature Causation, Physics, and the Constitution of Reality'' (Oxford U P, 2007), esp [https://books.google.com/books?id=oCXe4DvqUFMC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq= p 12].&lt;/ref&gt;  Even [[epidemiology]] is maturing to heed the severe difficulties with presumptions about causality.&lt;ref name=Kundi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karhausen&gt;{{Cite journal

The ''' Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS)''' is a structured interview for psychiatric disorders designed by researchers from the [[National Institute of Mental Health]], first published in 1991. Although most of the diagnoses were based on [[DSM-III-R]] criteria, the instrument was also able to generate diagnoses for certain disorders in other systems including [[DSM-IV]], [[Research Diagnostic Criteria]], [[ICD-10]] and [[Feighner Criteria]]. This was possible because of the instrument records symptoms in sufficient detail to allow different criteria to be applied.

The DIGS interview has gone through a number of revisions since being published. The latest version is DIGS 4.0/BP which was published in 2005. All DIGS versions are available to download from the NIMH Center for Collaborative Genomic Studies on Mental Disorders

In [[mathematics]], the '''dot product''' or '''scalar product'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;The term ''scalar product'' is often also used more generally to mean a [[symmetric bilinear form]], for example for a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]].{{cn|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[algebraic operation]] that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually [[coordinate vector]]s) and returns a single number.  In [[Euclidean geometry]], the dot product of the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of two [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]] is widely used and often called "the" '''inner product''' (or rarely '''projection product''') of Euclidean space even though it is not the only inner product that can be defined on Euclidean space; see also [[inner product space]].

Algebraically, the dot product is the sum of the [[Product (mathematics)|products]] of the corresponding entries of the two sequences of numbers. Geometrically, it is the product of the [[Euclidean vector#Length|Euclidean magnitude]]s of the two vectors and the [[cosine]] of the angle between them. These definitions are equivalent when using Cartesian coordinates. In modern [[geometry]], [[Euclidean space]]s are often defined by using [[vector space]]s. In this case, the dot product is used for defining lengths (the length of a vector is the [[square root]] of the dot product of the vector by itself) and angles (the cosine of the angle of two vectors is the quotient of their dot product by the product of their lengths).

The name "dot product" is derived from the [[Interpunct|centered dot]] "&amp;nbsp;'''·'''&amp;nbsp;" that is often used to designate this operation; the alternative name "scalar product" emphasizes that the result is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], rather than a [[Euclidean vector|vector]], as is the case for the [[vector product]] in three-dimensional space.

==Definition==
The dot product may be defined algebraically or geometrically.  The geometric definition is based on the notions of angle and distance (magnitude of vectors). The equivalence of these two definitions relies on having a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] for Euclidean space.

In modern presentations of [[Euclidean geometry]], the points of space are defined in terms of their [[Cartesian coordinates]], and [[Euclidean space]] itself is commonly identified with the [[real coordinate space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. In such a presentation, the notions of length and angles are defined by means of the dot product. The length of a vector is defined as the [[square root]] of the dot product of the vector by itself, and the [[cosine]] of the (non oriented) angle of two vectors of length one is defined as their dot product.  So the equivalence of the two definitions of the dot product is a part of the equivalence of the classical and the modern formulations of Euclidean geometry.

===Algebraic definition===
The dot product of two vectors {{nowrap|1={{ font color | red |  '''a'''}}  = {{ font color | red |[''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] }}}} and {{nowrap|1={{ font color | blue | '''b''' }} = {{ font color | blue |[''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] }}}} is defined as:&lt;ref name="Lipschutz2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=S. Lipschutz |author2=M. Lipson |title= Linear Algebra (Schaum’s Outlines)|edition= 4th |year= 2009|publisher= McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0-07-154352-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\color{red}a}\cdot\mathbf{\color{blue}b}=\sum_{i=1}^n {\color{red}a}_i{\color{blue}b}_i={\color{red}a}_1{\color{blue}b}_1+{\color{red}a}_2{\color{blue}b}_2+\cdots+{\color{red}a}_n{\color{blue}b}_n&lt;/math&gt;

where Σ denotes [[Summation|summation]] and ''n'' is the dimension of the [[vector space]]. For instance, in [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|three-dimensional space]], the dot product of vectors {{nowrap|{{ font color | red |[1, 3, −5]}}}} and {{nowrap|{{ font color | blue |[4, −2, −1]}}}} is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\ [{\color{red}1, 3, -5}] \cdot  [{\color{blue}4, -2, -1}] &amp;= ({\color{red}1} \times {\color{blue}4}) + ({\color{red}3}\times{\color{blue}-2}) + ({\color{red}-5}\times{\color{blue}-1}) \\
&amp;= 4 - 6 + 5 \\
&amp;= 3
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If vectors are identified with [[row matrix|row matrices]], the dot product can also be written as a [[matrix multiplication|matrix product]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\color{red}a} \cdot \mathbf{\color{blue}b} = \mathbf{\color{red}a}\mathbf{\color{blue}b}^\top,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\color{blue}b}^\top&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[transpose]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\color{blue}b}&lt;/math&gt;.

Expressing  the above example in this way, a 1 × 3 matrix ([[row vector]]) is multiplied by a 3 × 1 matrix ([[column vector]]) to get a 1 × 1 matrix that is identified with its unique entry: 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
   \color{red}1 &amp; \color{red}3 &amp; \color{red}-5
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
   \color{blue}4 \\ \color{blue}-2 \\ \color{blue}-1
  \end{bmatrix} = \color{purple}3 
&lt;/math&gt;.

===Geometric definition===
[[File:Inner-product-angle.svg|thumb|Illustration showing how to find the angle between vectors using the dot product]]
In [[Euclidean space]], a [[Euclidean vector]] is a geometric object that possesses both a magnitude and a direction.  A vector can be pictured as an arrow.  Its magnitude is its length, and its direction is the direction that the arrow points.  The magnitude of a vector '''a''' is denoted by &lt;math&gt; \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| &lt;/math&gt;.  The dot product of two Euclidean vectors '''a''' and '''b''' is defined by&lt;ref name="Spiegel2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=M.R. Spiegel |author2=S. Lipschutz |author3=D. Spellman |title= Vector Analysis (Schaum’s Outlines)|edition= 2nd |year= 2009|publisher= McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=A I Borisenko|author2=I E Taparov|title=Vector and tensor analysis with applications|publisher=Dover|translator=Richard Silverman|year=1968|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=\|\mathbf{a}\|\ \|\mathbf{b}\|\cos(\theta) ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|θ}} is the [[angle]] between '''a''' and '''b'''.

In particular, if '''a''' and '''b''' are [[orthogonal]] (the angle between vectors is 90°) then due to &lt;math&gt;\cos(90^\circ) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;
At the other extreme, if they are codirectional, then the angle between them is 0° and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = \left\| \mathbf a \right\| \, \left\| \mathbf b \right\| &lt;/math&gt;
This implies that the dot product of a vector '''a''' with itself is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf a = \left\| \mathbf a \right\| ^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;
which gives
: &lt;math&gt; \left\| \mathbf a \right\| = \sqrt{\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf a} ,&lt;/math&gt;
the formula for the [[Euclidean length]] of the vector.

===Scalar projection and first properties===
[[File:Dot Product.svg|thumb|right|Scalar projection]]
The [[scalar projection]] (or scalar component) of a Euclidean vector '''a''' in the direction of a Euclidean vector '''b''' is given by
:&lt;math&gt; a_b = \left\| \mathbf a \right\| \cos \theta ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|θ}} is the angle between '''a''' and '''b'''.

In terms of the geometric definition of the dot product, this can be rewritten
:&lt;math&gt;a_b = \mathbf a \cdot \widehat{\mathbf b} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \widehat{\mathbf b} = \mathbf b / \left\| \mathbf b \right\| &lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit vector]] in the direction of '''b'''.

[[File:Dot product distributive law.svg|thumb|right|Distributive law for the dot product]]
The dot product is thus characterized geometrically by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Arfken | first1=G. B. | last2=Weber | first2=H. J. | title=Mathematical Methods for Physicists | publisher=[[Academic Press]] | location=Boston, MA | edition=5th | isbn=978-0-12-059825-0 | year=2000 | pages=14–15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = a_b \left\| \mathbf{b} \right\| = b_a \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| .&lt;/math&gt;
The dot product, defined in this manner, is homogeneous under scaling in each variable, meaning that for any scalar ''α'',
:&lt;math&gt; ( \alpha \mathbf{a} ) \cdot \mathbf b = \alpha ( \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b ) = \mathbf a \cdot ( \alpha \mathbf b ) .&lt;/math&gt;
It also satisfies a [[distributive law]], meaning that
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf a \cdot ( \mathbf b + \mathbf c ) = \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b + \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf c .&lt;/math&gt;

These properties may be summarized by saying that the dot product is a [[bilinear form]]. Moreover, this bilinear form is [[positive definite bilinear form|positive definite]], which means that 
&lt;math&gt; \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf a &lt;/math&gt;
is never negative and is zero if and only if &lt;math&gt; \mathbf a = \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;, the zero vector.

===Equivalence of the definitions===
If '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[standard basis|standard basis vectors]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then we may write
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf a &amp;= [a_1 , \dots , a_n] = \sum_i a_i \mathbf e_i \\
\mathbf b &amp;= [b_1 , \dots , b_n] = \sum_i b_i \mathbf e_i.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are an [[orthonormal basis]], which means that they have unit length and are at right angles to each other.  Hence since these vectors have unit length
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf e_i \cdot \mathbf e_i = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
and since they form right angles with each other, if {{nowrap|''i'' ≠ ''j''}},
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf e_i \cdot \mathbf e_j = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;
Thus in general we can say that:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf e_i \cdot \mathbf e_j = \delta_ {ij} .&lt;/math&gt;
Where δ &lt;sub&gt; ij &lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]].

Also, by the geometric definition, for any vector '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and a vector '''a''', we note
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf e_i = \left\| \mathbf a \right\| \, \left\| \mathbf e_i \right\| \cos \theta = \left\| \mathbf a \right\| \cos \theta = a_i ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the component of vector '''a''' in the direction of '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Now applying the distributivity of the geometric version of the dot product gives
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b = \mathbf a \cdot \sum_i b_i \mathbf e_i = \sum_i b_i ( \mathbf a \cdot \mathbf e_i ) = \sum_i b_i a_i= \sum_i a_i b_i  ,&lt;/math&gt;
which is precisely the algebraic definition of the dot product.  So the geometric dot product equals the algebraic dot product.

==Properties==
The dot product fulfills the following properties if '''a''', '''b''', and '''c''' are real [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] and ''r'' is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]].&lt;ref name="Lipschutz2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel2009" /&gt;

# '''[[Commutative]]:'''
#: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a} ,&lt;/math&gt;
#: which follows from the definition (''θ'' is the angle between '''a''' and '''b'''):
#: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| \left\| \mathbf{b} \right\| \cos \theta = \left\| \mathbf{b} \right\| \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| \cos \theta = \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a} .&lt;/math&gt;
# '''[[Distributive property|Distributive]] over vector addition:'''
#: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} .&lt;/math&gt;
# '''[[bilinear form|Bilinear]]''':
#: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \cdot ( r \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} ) = r ( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} ) + ( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} ) .&lt;/math&gt;
# '''[[Scalar multiplication]]:'''
#: &lt;math&gt; ( c_1 \mathbf{a} ) \cdot ( c_2 \mathbf{b} ) = c_1 c_2 ( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} ) .&lt;/math&gt;
# '''Not [[associative]]''' because the dot product between a scalar ('''a ⋅ b''') and a vector ('''c''') is not defined, which means that the expressions involved in the associative property, ('''a ⋅ b''') ⋅ '''c''' or '''a''' ⋅ ('''b ⋅ c''') are both ill-defined.&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. "Dot Product." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DotProduct.html&lt;/ref&gt; Note however that the previously mentioned scalar multiplication property is sometimes called the "associative law for scalar and dot product"&lt;ref name="BanchoffWermer1983"&gt;{{cite book|author1=T. Banchoff|author2=J. Wermer|title=Linear Algebra Through Geometry|year=1983|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4684-0161-5|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or one can say that "the dot product is associative with respect to scalar multiplication" because ''c'' ('''a''' ⋅ '''b''') = (''c'' '''a''') ⋅ '''b''' = '''a''' ⋅ (''c'' '''b''').&lt;ref name="BedfordFowler2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A. Bedford|author2=Wallace L. Fowler|title=Engineering Mechanics: Statics|year=2008|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-612915-8|edition=5th|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Orthogonal]]:'''
#: Two non-zero vectors '''a''' and '''b''' are ''orthogonal'' [[if and only if]] {{nowrap|1='''a''' ⋅ '''b''' = 0}}.
# '''No [[cancellation law|cancellation]]:'''
#: Unlike multiplication of ordinary numbers, where if {{nowrap|1=''ab'' = ''ac''}}, then ''b'' always equals ''c'' unless ''a'' is zero, the dot product does not obey the [[cancellation law]]:
#: If {{nowrap|1='''a''' ⋅ '''b''' = '''a''' ⋅ '''c'''}} and {{nowrap|'''a''' ≠ '''0'''}}, then we can write: {{nowrap|1='''a''' ⋅ ('''b''' − '''c''') = 0}} by the [[distributive law]]; the result above says this just means that '''a''' is perpendicular to {{nowrap|('''b''' − '''c''')}}, which still allows {{nowrap|('''b''' − '''c''') ≠ '''0'''}}, and therefore {{nowrap|'''b''' ≠ '''c'''}}.
# '''[[Product Rule]]:''' If '''a''' and '''b''' are [[function (mathematics)|functions]], then the derivative ([[Notation for differentiation#Lagrange's notation|denoted by a prime]] ′) of {{nowrap|'''a''' ⋅ '''b'''}} is {{nowrap|'''a'''′ ⋅ '''b''' + '''a''' ⋅ '''b'''′}}.

===Application to the law of cosines===
[[File:Dot product cosine rule.svg|100px|thumb|Triangle with vector edges '''a''' and '''b''', separated by angle ''θ''.]]

{{main|Law of cosines}}

Given two vectors '''a''' and '''b''' separated by angle ''θ'' (see image right), they form a triangle with a third side {{nowrap|1={{ font color | gold |'''c'''}} = {{ font color | red |'''a'''}} − {{ font color | blue |'''b'''}}}}. The dot product of this with itself is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{\color{gold}c} \cdot \mathbf{\color{gold}c}  &amp; = ( \mathbf{\color{red}a} - \mathbf{\color{blue}b}) \cdot ( \mathbf{\color{red}a} - \mathbf{\color{blue}b} ) \\
 &amp; = \mathbf{\color{red}a} \cdot \mathbf{\color{red}a} - \mathbf{\color{red}a} \cdot \mathbf{\color{blue}b} - \mathbf{\color{blue}b} \cdot \mathbf{\color{red}a} + \mathbf{\color{blue}b} \cdot \mathbf{\color{blue}b} \\
 &amp; = {\color{red}a}^2 - \mathbf{\color{red}a} \cdot \mathbf{\color{blue}b} - \mathbf{\color{red}a} \cdot \mathbf{\color{blue}b} + {\color{blue}b}^2 \\
 &amp; = {\color{red}a}^2 - 2 \mathbf{\color{red}a} \cdot \mathbf{\color{blue}b} + {\color{blue}b}^2 \\
 {\color{gold}c}^2 &amp; = {\color{red}a}^2 + {\color{blue}b}^2 - 2 {\color{red}a} {\color{blue}b} \cos {\color{purple}\theta} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is the [[law of cosines]].
{{clear}}

==Triple product==
{{Main|Triple product}}

There are two [[ternary operation]]s involving dot product and [[cross product]].

The '''scalar triple product''' of three vectors is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \cdot ( \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} ) = \mathbf{b} \cdot ( \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a} )=\mathbf{c} \cdot ( \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} ).&lt;/math&gt;
Its value is the [[determinant]] of the matrix whose columns are the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the three vectors. It is the signed [[volume]] of the [[parallelogram]] defined by the three vectors.

The '''vector triple product''' is defined by&lt;ref name="Lipschutz2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel2009" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \times ( \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} ) = \mathbf{b} ( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{c} ) - \mathbf{c} ( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} ).&lt;/math&gt;
This identity, also known as ''Lagrange's formula'' [[mnemonic|may be remembered]] as "BAC minus CAB", keeping in mind which vectors are dotted together. This formula finds application in simplifying vector calculations in [[physics]].

==Physics==
In [[physics]], vector magnitude is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] in the physical sense, i.e. a [[physical quantity]] independent of the coordinate system, expressed as the [[product (mathematics)|product]]  of a [[number|numerical value]] and a [[physical unit]], not just a number. The dot product is also a scalar in this sense, given by the formula, independent of the coordinate system.  Examples include:&lt;ref name="Riley2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1=K.F. Riley |author2=M.P.

==Generalizations==

===Complex vectors===
For vectors with [[complex number|complex]] entries, using the given definition of the dot product would lead to quite different properties. For instance the dot product of a vector with itself would be an arbitrary complex number, and could be zero without the vector being the zero vector (such vectors are called [[Isotropic quadratic form|isotropic]]); this in turn would have consequences for notions like length and angle. Properties such as the positive-definite norm can be salvaged at the cost of giving up the symmetric and bilinear properties of the scalar product, through the alternative definition&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=287|first=Sterling K.|last=Berberian|title=Linear Algebra|year=2014|origyear=1992|publisher=Dover|isbn=978-0-486-78055-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipschutz2009" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum{\overline{a_i} b_i} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;''a''&lt;/span&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[complex conjugate]] of ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then the scalar product of any vector with itself is a non-negative real number, and it is nonzero except for the zero vector. However this scalar product is thus [[sesquilinear]] rather than bilinear: it is [[conjugate linear]] and not linear in '''a''', and the scalar product is not symmetric, since
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \overline{\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a}} .&lt;/math&gt;
The angle between two complex vectors is then given by
:&lt;math&gt; \cos \theta = \frac{\operatorname{Re} ( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} )}{ \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| \, \left\| \mathbf{b} \right\| } .&lt;/math&gt;

This type of scalar product is nevertheless useful, and leads to the notions of [[Hermitian form]] and of general [[inner product space]]s.

===Inner product===
{{main|Inner product space}}
The inner product generalizes the dot product to [[vector space|abstract vector spaces]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]], being either the field of [[real number]]s &lt;math&gt; \R &lt;/math&gt; or the field of [[complex number]]s &lt;math&gt; \Complex &lt;/math&gt;. It is usually denoted using [[angular brackets]] by &lt;math&gt; \left\langle \mathbf{a} \, , \mathbf{b} \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

The inner product of two vectors over the field of complex numbers is, in general, a complex number, and  is [[Sesquilinear form|sesquilinear]] instead of bilinear. An inner product space is a [[normed vector space]], and the inner product of a vector with itself is real and positive-definite.

===Functions===
The dot product is defined for vectors that have a finite number of [[coordinate vector|entries]]. Thus these vectors can be regarded as [[discrete function]]s: a length-{{math|''n''}} vector {{math|''u''}} is, then, a function with [[domain of a function|domain]] {{math|{''k'' ∈ ℕ ∣ 1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n''}}}, and {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a notation for the image of {{math|''i''}} by the function/vector {{math|''u''}}.

This notion can be generalized to [[continuous function]]s: just as the inner product on vectors uses a sum over corresponding components, the inner product on functions is defined as an integral over some [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|''a'' ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''b''}} (also denoted {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}):&lt;ref name="Lipschutz2009" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle u , v \right\rangle = \int_a^b u(x) v(x) d x &lt;/math&gt;

Generalized further to [[complex function]]s {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}} and {{math|''χ''(''x'')}}, by analogy with the complex inner product above, gives&lt;ref name="Lipschutz2009" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \left\langle \psi , \chi \right\rangle = \int_a^b \psi(x) \overline{\chi(x)} d x .&lt;/math&gt;

===Weight function===
Inner products can have a [[weight function]], i.e. a function which weights each term of the inner product with a value.

===Dyadics and matrices===
[[Matrix (mathematics)|Matrices]] have the [[Frobenius inner product]], which is analogous to the vector inner product. It is defined as the sum of the products of the corresponding components of two matrices '''A''' and '''B''' having the same size:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} : \mathbf{B} = \sum_i \sum_j A_{ij} \overline{B_{ij}} = \mathrm{tr} ( \mathbf{B}^\mathrm{H} \mathbf{A} ) = \mathrm{tr} ( \mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}^\mathrm{H} ) .&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} : \mathbf{B} = \sum_i \sum_j A_{ij} B_{ij} = \mathrm{tr} ( \mathbf{B}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{A} ) = \mathrm{tr} ( \mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}^\mathrm{T} ) = \mathrm{tr} ( \mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{B} ) = \mathrm{tr} ( \mathbf{B} \mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T} ) .&lt;/math&gt; (For real matrices)

[[Dyadics]] have a dot product and "double" dot product defined on them, see [[Dyadics#Product of dyadic and dyadic|Dyadics (Product of dyadic and dyadic)]] for their definitions.

===Tensors===
The inner product between a [[tensor]] of order ''n'' and a tensor of order ''m'' is a tensor of order {{nowrap|''n'' + ''m'' − 2}}, see [[tensor contraction]] for details.

==Computation==

===Algorithms===

The straightforward algorithm for calculating a floating-point dot product of vectors can suffer from [[catastrophic cancellation]]. To avoid this, approaches such as the [[Kahan summation algorithm]] are used.

===Libraries===
A dot product function is included in [[BLAS]] level 1.

{{American socialism |History}}

The '''First Red Scare''' was a period during [[History of the United States (1918–1945)|the early 20th-century history of the United States]] marked by a widespread fear of [[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]] and [[anarchism]], due to real and imagined events; real events included the [[Russian Revolution]] and [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|anarchist bombings]].  At its height in 1919–1920, concerns over the effects of radical political agitation in American society and the alleged spread of [[communism]] and [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchism]] in the [[American labor movement]] fueled a general sense of concern.

The Scare had its origins in the [[hyper-nationalism]] of [[World War I]] as well as the Russian Revolution.  At the war's end, following the [[October Revolution]], American authorities saw the threat of Communist revolution in the actions of [[Trade union|organized labor]], including such disparate cases as the [[Seattle General Strike]] and the [[Boston Police Strike]] and then in the [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|bombing campaign]] directed by anarchist groups at political and business leaders. Fueled by labor unrest and the anarchist bombings, and then spurred on by [[United States Attorney General]] [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer|A. Mitchell Palmer's]] attempt to suppress radical organizations, it was characterized by exaggerated rhetoric, [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|illegal search and seizures]], [[Arrest warrant|unwarranted arrests]] and detentions, and the [[deportation]] of several hundred suspected radicals and anarchists. In addition, the growing anti-[[immigration]] [[nativism (politics)|nativism]] movement among Americans viewed increasing immigration from [[Southern Europe]] and [[Eastern Europe]] as a threat to American political and social stability.

Bolshevism and the threat of a [[Communism|Communist]]-inspired revolution in the U.S. became the overriding explanation for challenges to the [[social order]], even such largely unrelated events as incidents of [[Mass racial violence in the United States|interracial violence]]. Fear of radicalism was used to explain the suppression of freedom of expression in form of display of certain flags and banners. The First Red Scare effectively ended in mid-1920, after Attorney General Palmer forecast a massive radical uprising on [[May Day]] and the day passed without incident.

==Origins==
The First Red Scare's immediate cause was the increase in subversive actions (both real and imagined) of foreign and [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] elements in the United States, especially militant followers of [[Luigi Galleani]], and in the attempts of the U.S. government to quell protest and gain favorable public views of America's entering [[World War I]]. At the end of the 19th century and prior to the rise of the Galleanist anarchist movement, the [[Haymarket affair]] of 1886 had already heightened the American public's fear of foreign anarchist and radical socialist elements within the budding American workers' movement. In 1917, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] established the [[Committee on Public Information]] to circulate and distribute anti-[[Germany|German]] and pro-[[Allies of World War I|Allied]] propaganda and other news. To add to the effectiveness of the Committee, the Bureau of Investigation (the name for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] until 1935) disrupted the work of German-American, union, and leftist organizations through the use of raids, arrests, [[agents provocateurs]], and legal prosecution. [[Revolutionary]] and [[Pacifism|pacifist]] groups, such as the [[Socialist Party of America]] and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW; its members are known as ''Wobblies''), strongly opposed the war. Many leaders of these groups, most notably [[Eugene V. Debs]], were prosecuted for giving speeches urging resistance to the [[Conscription|draft]]. Members of the [[Ghadar Party]] were also put on trial in the [[Hindu–German Conspiracy Trial]].

The effort was also helped by the [[United States Congress]], with the passing of the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]] in 1917, the [[Sedition Act of 1918]], and the [[Immigration Act of 1918]]. The Espionage Act made it a crime to interfere with the operation or success of the military, and the Sedition Act forbade Americans to use "disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language" about the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]], [[Flag of the United States|flag]], or [[Military of the United States|armed forces of the United States]] during war.&lt;ref&gt;Laws of the United States, ''Espionage Act of 1917'' (Act of June 15, 1917), ch. 30, title I, §3, 40 Stat. 219, amended by Act of May 16, 1918, ch. 75, 40 Stat. 553-54, reenacted by Act of Mar. 3, 1921, ch. 136, 41 Stat. 1359, (codified at 18 U.S.C. §2388); Laws of the United States, ''Sedition Act of 1918'', (1918 Amendments to §3 of The Espionage Act of 1917), Act of May 16, 1918, ch. 75, 40 Stat. 553-54, (repealed by Act of Mar. 3, 1921, ch. 136, 41 Stat. 1359)&lt;/ref&gt; The Immigration Act of 1918 targeted anarchists by name and was used to deport [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Luigi Galleani]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hagedorn, ''Savage Peace: Hope and Fear in America, 1919'' (NY: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2007), 184-5, 218-22&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war officially ended, the government investigations abated for a few months but did not cease. They soon resumed in the context of the Russian Revolution of 1917, the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]], and the [[Red Terror]]. To some Americans, this was a time of uncertainty and fear over the prospects of an anarchist, socialist or communist revolution in the United States.

=={{anchor|History}} Progression of events==

===Seattle General Strike===
{{Main|Seattle General Strike}}
[[File:Seattle General Strike.jpg|thumb|Headlines announcing the [[Seattle General Strike|Seattle General Strike of 1919]], the nation's first [[general strike]]]]
On January 21, 1919, 35,000 shipyard workers in [[Seattle]] went on strike seeking wage increases. They appealed to the Seattle Central Labor Council for support from other unions and found widespread enthusiasm. Within two weeks, more than 100 local unions joined in a call on February 3 for general strike to begin on the morning of February 6.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 58-60; Brecher, 121&lt;/ref&gt; The 60,000 total strikers paralyzed the city's normal activities, like streetcar service, schools, and ordinary commerce, while their General Strike Committee maintained order and provided essential services, like trash collection and milk deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 87; [[Jeremy Brecher|Brecher]], 122-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the strike began, the press begged the unions to reconsider. In part they were frightened by some of labor's rhetoric, like the labor newspaper editorial that proclaimed: "We are undertaking the most tremendous move ever made by labor in this country&amp;nbsp; ... We are starting on a road that leads &amp;ndash; NO ONE KNOWS WHERE!"&lt;ref&gt;Brecher, 124-5&lt;/ref&gt; Daily newspapers saw the general strike as a foreign import: "This is America &amp;ndash; not Russia," one said when denouncing the general strike.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 60-1&lt;/ref&gt; The non-striking part of Seattle's population imagined the worst and stocked up on food. Hardware stores sold their stock of guns.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 60-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Seattle Mayor [[Ole Hanson]] announced that he had 1500 police and 1500 federal troops on hand to put down any disturbances. He personally oversaw their deployment throughout the city.&lt;ref name="Murray, 63"&gt;Murray, 63&lt;/ref&gt; "The time has come," he said, "for the people in Seattle to show their Americanism&amp;nbsp; ... The anarchists in this community shall not rule its affairs."&lt;ref name="Murray, 63"/&gt; He promised to use them to replace striking workers, but never carried out that threat.&lt;ref&gt;Brecher, 126-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile the national leadership of the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) and international leaders of some of the Seattle locals recognized how inflammatory the general strike was proving in the eyes of the American public and Seattle's middle class. Press and political reaction made the general strike untenable, and they feared Seattle labor would lose gains made during the war if it continued.&lt;ref&gt;Brecher, 127-8; Murray, 64&lt;/ref&gt; The national press called the general strike "Marxian" and "a revolutionary movement aimed at existing government."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 65&lt;/ref&gt; "It is only a middling step," said the ''Chicago Tribune'', "from Petrograd to Seattle."&lt;ref&gt;Murray 65&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as February 8 some unions began to return to work at the urging of their leaders. Some workers went back to work as individuals, perhaps fearful of losing their jobs if the Mayor acted on his threats or in reaction to the pressure of life under the general strike.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 75&lt;/ref&gt; The executive committee of the General Strike Committee first recommended ending the general strike on February 8 but lost that vote. Finally on February 10, the General Strike Committee voted to end the strike the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 75-6&lt;/ref&gt; The original strike in the shipyards continued.&lt;ref&gt;Brecher, 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the general strike collapsed because labor leadership viewed it as a misguided tactic from the start, Mayor Hanson took credit for ending the five-day strike and was hailed by the press. He resigned a few months later and toured the country giving lectures on the dangers of "domestic bolshevism." He earned $38,000 in seven months, five times his annual salary as mayor.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 65-6; Hagedorn, 180&lt;/ref&gt; He published a pamphlet called ''Americanism versus Bolshevism''.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 77n; Noggle, 102-3; Ole Hanson, ''Americanism versus Bolshevism'' (Garden City, NY, 1920), [https://archive.org/details/americanismversu00hansuoft ''Americanism versus Bolshevism''], accessed April 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overman Committee===
{{Main|Overman Committee}}
[[File:OvermanCommittee.png|left|thumb|upright=1.67|alt="Senators Tell What Bolshevism in America Means.|''[[The New York Times]]'', June 15, 1919&lt;ref name=nytsenators&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/06/15/archives/senators-tell-what-bolshevism-in-america-means-overman-committee-no.html "Senators Tell What Bolshevism in America Means," June 15, 1919]. Retrieved February 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Overman Committee]] was a special five-man subcommittee of the U.S. [[Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] chaired by North Carolina Democrat [[Lee Slater Overman]]. First charged with investigating German subversion during World War I, its mandate was extended on February 4, 1919, just a day after the announcement of the Seattle General Strike, to study "any efforts being made to propagate in this country the principles of any party exercising or claiming to exercise any authority in Russia" and "any effort to incite the overthrow of the Government of this country.&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 6; Hagedorn, 55; Murray, 94; ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/02/05/archives/senate-orders-reds-here-investigated-directs-overman-committee-to.html "Senate Orders Reds Here Investigated," February 5, 1919]. Retrieved February 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee's hearings into Bolshevik propaganda, conducted from February 11 to March 10, 1919, developed an alarming image of Bolshevism as an imminent threat to the U.S. government and American values. The Committee's final report appeared in June 1919.

[[Archibald E. Stevenson]], a New York attorney with ties to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], probably as a "volunteer spy",&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 54, 58&lt;/ref&gt; testified on January 22, 1919, during the German phase of the subcommittee's work. He established that anti-war and anti-draft activism during World War I, which he described as pro-German activity, had now transformed itself into propaganda "developing sympathy for the Bolshevik movement".&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 12-4; Powers, 20&lt;/ref&gt; America's wartime enemy, though defeated, had exported an ideology that now ruled Russia and threatened America anew. "The Bolsheviki movement is a branch of the revolutionary socialism of Germany. It had its origin in the philosophy of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and its leaders were Germans."&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 14; Lowenthal, 49&lt;/ref&gt; He cited the propaganda efforts of [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] and gave many examples from the foreign press. He told the Senators that "We have found money coming into this country from Russia."&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 19, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senators were particularly interested in how Bolshevism had united many disparate elements on the left, including anarchists and socialists of many types,&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 14-8&lt;/ref&gt; "providing a common platform for all these radical groups to stand on."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 34&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Knute Nelson]], Republican of Minnesota, responded by enlarging Bolshevism's embrace to include an even larger segment of political opinion: "Then they have really rendered a service to the various classes of progressives and reformers that we have here in this country."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Other witnesses described the horrors of the revolution in Russia and the consequences of a comparable revolution in the United States: the imposition of atheism, the seizure of newspapers, assaults on banks, and the abolition of the insurance industry. The Senators heard various views of women in Russia, including claims that women were made the property of the state.&lt;ref&gt;United States Congress, ''Bolshevik Propaganda'', 475&lt;/ref&gt;

The press reveled in the investigation and the final report, referring to the Russians as "assassins and madmen," "human scum," "crime mad," and "beasts."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 97&lt;/ref&gt; The occasional testimony by some who viewed the Russian Revolution favorably lacked the punch of its critics. One extended headline in February read:&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F07E5DA1139E13ABC4052DFB4668382609EDE&amp; "Bolshevism Bared by R.E.

On the release of the final report, newspapers printed sensational articles with headlines in capital letters: "Red Peril Here", "Plan Bloody Revolution", and "Want Washington Government Overturned."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarchist bombings===
{{Main|1919 United States anarchist bombings}}
There were several anarchist bombings in 1919.

====April 1919 mail bombs====
[[File:Palmer Bombing.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer's house with bomb damage]]

In late April 1919, approximately 36 [[letter bomb|booby trap bombs were mailed]] to prominent politicians, including the Attorney General of the United States, judges, businessmen (including John D. Rockefeller),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footnote.com/spotlight/6883/1919_anarchist_bombings_chicago/ "Send Death Bombs to 36 U.S. Leaders"] ''Chicago Tribune'', May 1, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; and a Bureau of Investigation field agent, R.W. Finch, who happened to be investigating the ''Galleanist'' organization.&lt;ref&gt;The Galleanists were radical anarchists and devotees of Luigi Galleani who advocated 'direct action', i.e. bombing and assassination, against capitalists and representatives of the government.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background'', Princeton University Press (1991), pp. 147: The inclusion of R.W. Finch, a low-ranking BOI agent who had been assigned to question and investigate the ''Galleanist'' movement and had questioned other Galleanists about movements of its members, dispelled any doubt on the identity of the bombers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bombs were mailed in identical packages and were timed to arrive on May Day, the day of celebration of organized labor and the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background'', Princeton University Press (1991), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;  A few of the packages went undelivered because they lacked sufficient postage.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background'', p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;  One bomb intended for Seattle Mayor [[Ole Hanson]], who had opposed the Seattle General Strike, arrived early and failed to explode as intended. Seattle police in turn notified the Post Office and other police agencies. On April 29, a package sent to U.S. Senator [[Thomas W. Hardwick]] of Georgia, a sponsor of the [[Anarchist Exclusion Act]], exploded injuring his wife and housekeeper. On April 30, a post office employee in [[New York City]] recognized 16 packages by their wrapping and interrupted their delivery. Another twelve bombs were recovered before reaching their targets.

====June 1919 bombs====
In June 1919, eight bombs, far larger than those mailed in April, exploded almost simultaneously in several U.S. cities.  These new bombs were believed to contain up to twenty-five pounds of dynamite,&lt;ref name="PLO"&gt;''Plotter Here Hid Trail Skillfully; His Victim Was A Night Watchman'', The New York Times, 4 June 1919&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WRE"&gt;''Wreck Judge Nott's Home'', The New York Times, 3 June 1919&lt;/ref&gt; and all were wrapped or packaged with heavy metal slugs designed to act as shrapnel.&lt;ref&gt;''20 Pounds of Dynamite In Bomb Used in New York,'', The Washington Post, June 4, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;  All of the intended targets had participated in some way with the investigation of or the opposition to anarchist radicals.  Along with Attorney General Palmer, who was targeted a second time, the intended victims included a Massachusetts state representative and a New Jersey silk manufacturer.  Fatalities included a New York City night watchman, [https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1919-06-04/ed-1/seq-4/#date1=1919&amp;index=0&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Boehner+William+WILLIAM&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=1919&amp;ortext=William+Boehner&amp;proxtext=&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 William Boehner],&lt;ref name="PLO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WRE"/&gt; and one of the bombers, Carlo Valdinoci, a ''[[Luigi Galleani|Galleanist]]'' radical who died in spectacular fashion when the bomb he placed at the home of Attorney General Palmer exploded in his face.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'' (AK Press, 2005) {{ISBN|1-904859-27-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-904859-27-7}}, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; Though not seriously injured, Attorney General Palmer and his family were thoroughly shaken by the blast, and their home was largely demolished.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the bombs were delivered with pink flyers bearing the title "Plain Words" that accused the intended victims of waging class war and promised: "We will destroy to rid the world of your tyrannical institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, 149&lt;/ref&gt;  Police and the Bureau of Investigation tracked the flyer to a print shop owned by an anarchist, Andrea Salcedo, but never obtained sufficient evidence for a prosecution.  Evidence from Valdonoci's death, bomb components, and accounts from participants later tied both bomb attacks to the ''Galleanists''.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background'', Princeton University Press (1991), pp. 168-183&lt;/ref&gt;  Though some of the ''Galleanists'' were deported or left the country voluntarily, attacks by remaining members continued until 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'' (AK Press, 2005) {{ISBN|1-904859-27-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-904859-27-7}}, pp. 132, 501&lt;/ref&gt;

===May Day 1919===
The American labor movement had been celebrating its May Day holiday since the 1890s and had seen none of the violence associated with the day's events in Europe.&lt;ref name="Murray, 74"&gt;Murray, 74&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 1919, the left mounted especially large demonstrations, and violence greeted the normally peaceful parades in Boston, New York, and Cleveland. In Boston, police tried to stop a march that lacked a permit. In the ensuing melee both sides fought for possession of the Socialists' red flags. One policeman was stabbed and killed. [[William Sidis]] was arrested. Later a mob attacked the Socialist headquarters. Police arrested 114, all from the Socialist side. Each side's newspapers provided uncritical support to their own the next day.&lt;ref name="Murray, 74"/&gt; In New York, soldiers in uniform burned printed materials at the Russian People's House and forced immigrants to sing the ''Star-Spangled Banner''.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 185-6; Murray, 75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cleveland, Ohio]] saw the worst violence. Leftists protesting the imprisonment of [[Eugene V. Debs]] and promoting the campaign of [[Charles Ruthenberg]], the Socialist candidate for mayor, planned to march through the center of the city. A group of [[War bond|Victory Loan]] workers, a nationalist organization whose members sold war bonds and thought themselves still at war against all forms of anti-Americanism, tried to block some of the marchers and a [[May Day Riots of 1919|melee ensued]]. A mob ransacked Ruthenberg's headquarters. Mounted police, army trucks, and tanks restored order. Two people died, forty were injured, and 116 arrested. Local newspapers noted that only 8 of those arrested were born in the United States. The city government immediately passed laws to restrict parades and the display of red flags.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 185-6; Murray 75-5&lt;/ref&gt;

With few dissents, newspapers blamed the May Day marchers for provoking the nationalists' response. The Salt Lake City ''Tribune'' did not think anyone had a right to march. It said: "Free speech has been carried to the point where it is an unrestrained menace."&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 185-6&lt;/ref&gt; A few, however, thought the marches were harmless and that the marchers' enthusiasm would die down on its own if they were left unmolested.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race riots===
{{Main|Red Summer of 1919}}
More than two dozen American communities, mostly urban areas or industrial centers, saw racial violence in the summer and early fall of 1919. Unlike earlier race riots in U.S. history, the 1919 riots were among the first in which blacks responded with resistance to the white attacks. Martial law was imposed in [[Charleston, South Carolina]],&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/10/05/archives/for-action-on-race-riot-peril-radical-propaganda-among-negroes.html "For Action on Race Riot Peril," October 5, 1919], accessed January 20, 2010. This newspaper article includes several paragraphs of editorial analysis followed by Dr. Haynes' report, "summarized at several points."&lt;/ref&gt; where men of the U.S. Navy led a race riot on May 10.  Five white men and eighteen black men were injured in the riot. A Naval investigation found that four U.S. sailors and one civilian—all white men—were responsible for the outbreak of violence.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;Walter C. Rucker, James N. Upton.

[[File:chicago-race-riot.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A white gang looking for African Americans during the [[Chicago race riot of 1919]]]]
Two of the most violent episodes occurred in Washington, D.C. and Chicago. In Washington, D.C., white men, many in military uniforms, responded to the rumored arrest of a black man for rape with four days of mob violence, rioting and beatings of random black people on the street. When police refused to intervene, the black population fought back. When the violence ended, ten whites were dead, including two police officers, and 5 blacks. Some 150 people had been the victims of attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, 60–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago race riot of 1919|rioting in Chicago]] started on July 27. Chicago's beaches along Lake Michigan were segregated in practice, if not by law. A black youth who drifted into the area customarily reserved for whites was stoned and drowned. Blacks responded violently when the police refused to take action. Violence between mobs and gangs lasted 13 days. The resulting 38 fatalities included 23 blacks and 15 whites. Injuries numbered 537 injured, and 1,000 black families were left homeless.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/110488/Chicago-Race-Riot-of-1919 "Chicago Race Riot of 1919"]. Retrieved January 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 50 people were reported dead. Unofficial numbers were much higher. Hundreds of mostly black homes and businesses on the South Side were destroyed by mobs, and a militia force of several thousand was called in to restore order.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

In mid-summer, in the middle of the Chicago riots, a "federal official" told the ''New York Times'' that the violence resulted from "an agitation, which involves the I.W.W., Bolshevism and the worst features of other extreme radical movements." He supported that claim with copies of negro publications that called for alliances with leftist groups, praised the Soviet regime, and contrasted the courage of jailed Socialist Eugene V. Debs with the "school boy rhetoric" of traditional black leaders. The ''Times'' characterized the publications as "vicious and apparently well financed," mentioned "certain factions of the radical Socialist elements," and reported it all under the headline: "Reds Try to Stir Negroes to Revolt."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E07E0D71638E13ABC4051DFB1668382609EDE "Reds Try to Stir Negroes to Revolt," July 28, 1919]. Retrieved January 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-October, government sources again provided the ''Times'' with evidence of Bolshevist propaganda targeting America's black communities that was "paralleling the agitation that is being carried on in industrial centres of the North and West, where there are many alien laborers." Vehicles for this propaganda about the "doctrines of Lenin and Trotzky" included newspapers, magazines, and "so-called 'negro betterment' organizations." Quotations from such publications contrasted the recent violence in Chicago and Washington, D.C. with "Soviet Russia, a country in which dozens of racial and lingual types have settled their many differences and found a common meeting ground, a country which no longer oppresses colonies, a country from which the lynch rope is banished and in which racial tolerance and peace now exist." The ''Times'' cited one publication's call for unionization: "Negroes must form cotton workers' unions. Southern white capitalists know that the negroes can bring the white bourbon South to its knees. So go to it."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/10/19/archives/reds-are-working-among-negroes-widespread-propaganda-by-radical.html "Reds are Working among Negroes," October 19, 1919].

===Strikes===

====Boston Police Strike====
{{Main|Boston Police Strike}}
The [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) began granting charters to police unions in June 1919 when pressed to do so by local groups, and in just 5 months had recognized affiliate police unions in 37 cities.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 93; Slater 243&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Police Department|Boston police]] rank and file went out on strike on September 9, 1919 in order to achieve recognition for their union and improvements in wages and working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 351-3&lt;/ref&gt; Police Commissioner [[Edwin Upton Curtis]] denied that police officers had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the AFL. During the strike, [[Boston]] experienced two nights of lawlessness until several thousand members of the State Guard supported by volunteers restored order, though not without causing several deaths. The public, fed by lurid press accounts and hyperbolic political observers, viewed the strike with a degree of alarm out of proportion to the events, which ultimately produced only about $35,000 of property damage.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 96&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box
 | quote  = Bolshevism in the United States is no longer a specter. Boston in chaos reveals its sinister substance.

The strikers were called "deserters" and "agents of Lenin."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 126&lt;/ref&gt; The Philadelphia ''Public Ledger'' viewed the Boston violence in the same light as many other of 1919's events: "Bolshevism in the United States is no longer a specter. Boston in chaos reveals its sinister substance."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 129; Foner, 96-7&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Woodrow Wilson]], speaking from Montana, branded the walkout "a crime against civilization" that left the city "at the mercy of an army of thugs."&lt;ref&gt;Pietrusza, 99&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of the strike also happened to present the police union in the worst light. September 10, the first full day of the strike, was also the day a huge New York City parade celebrated the return of Gen. [[John J. Pershing]], the hero of the [[American Expeditionary Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 351-2&lt;/ref&gt;

A report from Washington, D.C. included this headline: "Senators Think Effort to Sovietize the Government Is Started."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 130&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] saw in the strike the dangers of the national labor movement: "If the American Federation of Labor succeeds in getting hold of the police in Boston it will go all over the country, and we shall be in measurable distance of Soviet government by labor unions."&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 97&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ohio State Journal'' opposed any sympathetic treatment of the strikers: "When a policeman strikes, he should be debarred not only from resuming his office, but from citizenship as well. He has committed the unpardonable sin; he has forfeited all his rights."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Gompers]] of the AFL recognized that the strike was damaging labor in the public mind and advised the strikers to return to work. The Police Commissioner, however, remained adamant and refused to re-hire the striking policemen. He was supported by Massachusetts Governor [[Calvin Coolidge]], whose rebuke of Gompers earned him a national reputation. Famous as a man of few words, he put the anti-union position simply: "There is no right to strike against the public safety, anywhere, anytime."&lt;ref&gt;Pietrusza, 100; Foner, 100. See also ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/09/15/archives/bay-state-governor-firm-says-wilsons-suggestion-does-not-apply-as.html "Bay State Governor Firm," September 15, 1919]. Retrieved February 5, 1919.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strike proved another setback for labor and the AFL immediately withdrew its recognition of police unions. Coolidge won the Republican nomination for Vice-President in the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 presidential election]] in part due to his actions during the Boston Police Strike.

==== Steel strike of 1919 ====
{{Main|Steel strike of 1919}}
[[File:Coming out of the smoke.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|"Coming out of the Smoke", ''New York World'', October 11, 1919]]

Though the leadership of the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) opposed a strike in the steel industry, 98% of their union members voted to strike beginning on September 22, 1919. It shut down half the steel industry, including almost all mills in [[Pueblo, Colorado]]; [[Chicago, Illinois]]; [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]; [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]]; [[Cleveland, Ohio]]; [[Lackawanna, New York]]; and [[Youngstown, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;Brody, 233-44&lt;/ref&gt;

The owners quickly turned public opinion against the AFL. As the strike began, they published information exposing AFL National Committee co-chairman William Z. Foster's radical past as a [[Industrial Workers of the World|Wobbly]] and [[syndicalism|syndicalist]], and claimed this was evidence that the steelworker strike was being masterminded by radicals and revolutionaries. The steel companies played on nativist fears by noting that a large number of steelworkers were immigrants. Public opinion quickly turned against the striking workers. State and local authorities backed the steel companies. They prohibited mass meetings, had their police attack pickets and jailed thousands. After strikebreakers and police clashed with unionists in [[Gary, Indiana]], the [[U.S. Army]] took over the city on October 6, 1919, and [[martial law]] was declared. National guardsmen, leaving Gary after federal troops had taken over, turned their anger on strikers in nearby [[Indiana Harbor, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Rayback, 287; Brody, 244-253; Dubofsky and Dulles, 220&lt;/ref&gt;

Steel companies also turned toward strikebreaking and rumor-mongering to demoralize the picketers. They brought in between 30,000 and 40,000 [[African-American]] and [[Mexican-American]] workers to work in the mills. Company spies also spread rumors that the strike had collapsed elsewhere, and they pointed to the operating steel mills as proof that the strike had been defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Rayback, 287; Dubofsky and Dulles, 220-21; Brody, 254-55&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress conducted its own investigation, focused on radical influence upon union activity. In that context, U.S. Senator [[Kenneth McKellar (politician)|Kenneth McKellar]], a member of the Senate committee investigating the strike, proposed making one of the Philippine Islands a penal colony to which those convicted of an attempt to overthrow the government could be deported.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/10/25/archives/bill-provides-penal-colony-in-philippines-for-anarchists.html "Bill Provides Penal Colony in Philippines for Anarchists," October 25, 1919]. Retrieved January 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago mills gave in at the end of October. By the end of November, workers were back at their jobs in Gary, Johnstown, Youngstown, and Wheeling. The strike collapsed on January 8, 1920, though it dragged on in isolated areas like Pueblo and Lackawanna.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, 258-62&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coal strike of 1919====
The [[United Mine Workers]] under [[John L. Lewis]] announced a strike for November 1, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 176-8&lt;/ref&gt; They had agreed to a wage agreement to run until the end of World War I and now sought to capture some of their industry's wartime gains. Attorney General [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer|A.

Retrieved January 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; a wartime measure that made it a crime to interfere with the production or transportation of necessities. The law, meant to punish hoarding and profiteering, had never been used against a union. Certain of united political backing and almost universal public support, Palmer obtained an injunction on October 31&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/11/01/archives/palmer-to-enforce-law-defends-injunction-as-the-only-way-to-meet.html "Palmer to Enforce Law," November 1, 1919]. Retrieved January 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and 400,000 coal workers struck the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 178-9&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed the President authorized the action, following a meeting with the severely ill President in the presence of his doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 178-9. On the President's role, see also Kenneth D. Ackerman, ''Young J. Edgar: Hoover, the Red Scare, and the Assault on Civil Liberties'' (NY: Carroll &amp; Graf, 2007), 100&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer also asserted that the entire Cabinet had backed his request for an injunction. That infuriated Secretary of Labor Wilson who had opposed Palmer's plan and supported Gompers' view of the President's promises when the Act was under consideration. The rift between the Attorney General and the Secretary of Labor was never healed, which had consequences the next year when Palmer's attempts to deport radicals were [[Palmer raids#Aftermath|frustrated by the Department of Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus Daniels, ''The Wilson Era: Years of War and After, 1917-1923'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1946), 546-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Gompers]], President of the [[American Federation of Labor]], protested that President Wilson and members of his Cabinet had provided assurances when the Act was passed that it would not be used to prevent strikes by labor unions. He provided detailed accounts of his negotiations with representatives of the administration, especially Secretary of Labor [[William Bauchop Wilson|William B. Wilson]]. He also argued that the end of hostilities, even in the absence of a signed treaty, should have invalidated any attempts to enforce the Act's provisions.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/11/23/archives/gompers-repeats-injunction-charge-produces-notes-and-statements-to.html "Gompers Repeats Injunction Charge," November 23, 1919].

Final agreement came on December 10.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 181-3; ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/12/11/archives/miners-finally-agree-only-one-dissenting-voice-when-leaders-vote-to.html "Miners Finally Agree," December 11, 1919].

====Palmer Raids====
{{Main|Palmer Raids}}
[[File:Radicals awaiting deportation.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Men arrested in raids awaiting deportation hearings on Ellis Island, January 13, 1920]]

Despite two attempts on his life in April and June 1919, Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] moved slowly to find a way to attack the source of the violence. An initial raid in July 1919 against a small anarchist group in Buffalo failed when a federal judge tossed out his case.&lt;ref&gt;Pietruszka, 146-7&lt;/ref&gt; In August,  he organized the General Intelligence Unit within the Department of Justice and recruited [[J. Edgar Hoover]], a recent law school graduate, to head it.&lt;ref&gt;Pietruszka, 146&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover pored over arrest records, subscription records of radical newspapers, and party membership records to compile lists of resident aliens for deportation proceedings. On October 17, 1919, just a year after the [[Immigration Act of 1918]] had expanded the definition of aliens that could be deported, the U.S. Senate demanded Palmer explain his failure to move against radicals.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer launched his campaign against radicalism with two sets of police actions known as the [[Palmer Raids]] in November 1919 and January 1920. Federal agents supported by local police rounded up large groups of suspected radicals, often based on membership in a political group rather than any action taken. Undercover informants and warrantless wiretaps (authorized under the [[Sedition Act of 1918|Sedition Act]]) helped to identify several thousand suspected leftists and radicals to be arrested.

Only the dismissal of most of the cases by Acting [[United States Secretary of Labor]] [[Louis Freeland Post]] limited the number of deportations to 556. Fearful of extremist violence and revolution, the American public supported the raids. Civil libertarians, the radical left, and legal scholars raised protests. Officials at the Department of Labor, especially Post, asserted the rule of law in opposition to Palmer's anti-radical campaign. Post faced a Congressional threat to impeach or censure him. He successfully defended his actions in two days of testimony before the House Rules Committee in June 1919 and no action was ever taken against him. Palmer testified before the same committee, also for two days, and stood by the raids, arrests, and deportation program. Much of the press applauded Post's work at Labor, while Palmer, rather than President Wilson, was largely blamed for the negative aspects of the raids.

====Deportations====

On December 21, the [[USAT Buford|''Buford'']], a ship the press nicknamed the "Soviet Ark", left New York harbor with 249 deportees. Of those, 199 had been detained in the November [[Palmer Raids]], with 184 of them deported because of their membership in the [[Union of Russian Workers]], an anarchist group that was a primary target of the November raids. Others on board, including the well-known radical leaders [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]], had not been taken in the Palmer Raids. Goldman had been convicted in 1893 of "inciting to riot" and arrested on many other occasions. Berkman had served 14 years in prison for the attempted murder of industrialist [[Henry Clay Frick]] in 1892. Both were convicted in 1917 of interfering with military recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 12–6, 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the 249 were leftists or anarchists or at least fell within the legal definition of anarchist because they "believed that no government would be better for human society than any kind of government."&lt;ref&gt;Post, 14–6&lt;/ref&gt; In beliefs they ranged from violent revolutionaries to pacifist advocates of non-resistance. Others belonged to radical organizations but disclaimed knowledge of the organization's political aims and had joined to take advantage of educational programs and social opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, 158–63; Jerome Davis, ''The Russian Immigrant'' (NY: Macmillan, 1922), 114ff., 164ff.; [[Kate Claghorn|Kate Holladay Claghorn]], ''The Immigrant's Day in Court'' (NY: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1923), 367, 371–3. Louis Freeland Post details the case of Peter Bianky, who was fully aware of and committed to the revolutionary principles of the Union of Russian Workers, but as for most of that organization's members among the deportees Post thought it "a reasonable probability that they were totally ignorant of the objectionable clauses" in the organization's statements that provided the legal basis for deporting them. Post, 22–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notoriety of Goldman and Berkman as convicted anti-war agitators allowed the press and public to imagine that all the deportees had similar backgrounds. ''The New York Times'' called them all "Russian Reds".&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/12/13/archives/hundreds-of-reds-on-soviet-ark-sail-soon-for-russia-united-states.html "Hundreds of Reds on Soviet 'Ark' Sail Soon for Europe," December 13, 1919].

The Cleveland ''Plain Dealer'' wrote: "It is hoped and expected that other vessels, larger, more commodious, carrying similar cargoes, will follow in her wake."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 208–09&lt;/ref&gt; The New York ''[[New York Evening Mail|Evening Mail]]'' said: "Just as the sailing of the Ark that Noah built was a pledge for the preservation of the human race, so the sailing of the Ark of the Soviet is a pledge for the preservation of America."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 208&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman later wrote a book about her experiences after being deported to Russia, called ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]''.

===Expulsion of Socialists from the New York Assembly===
[[File:Five Socialist Assemblymen.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Five Socialist Assemblymen Suspended by the New York State Legislature&lt;ref&gt;George Matthew Adams Service, January 24, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On January 7, 1920, at the first session of the [[New York State Assembly]], Assembly Speaker [[Thaddeus C. Sweet]] attacked the Assembly's five Socialist members, declaring they had been "elected on a platform that is absolutely inimical to the best interests of the state of New York and the United States." The Socialist Party, Sweet said, was "not truly a political party," but was rather "a membership organization admitting within its ranks aliens, enemy aliens, and minors." It had supported the revolutionaries in [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|Germany]], Austria, and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]], he continued, and consorted with international Socialist parties close to the [[Communist International]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldman, 2-7&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly suspended the five by a vote of 140 to 6, with just one Democrat supporting the Socialists. A trial in the Assembly, lasting from January 20 to March 11, resulted in a recommendation that the five be expelled and [[Socialist Party of America#Expulsion of Socialists from the New York Assembly (1920)|the Assembly voted overwhelmingly for expulsion]] on April 1, 1920.

Opposition to the Assembly's actions was widespread and crossed party lines. From the start of the process, former Republican Governor, Supreme Court Justice, and presidential candidate [[Charles Evans Hughes]] defended the Socialist members: "Nothing&amp;nbsp; ... is a more serious mistake at this critical time than to deprive Socialists or radicals of their opportunities for peaceful discussion and thus to convince them that the Reds are right and that violence and revolution are the only available means at their command."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1920/01/10/archives/hughes-upholds-socialists-rights-tells-speaker-sweet-assemblys.html "Hughes Upholds Socialists' Rights," January 10, 2910].

==Coverage==

===Newspaper coverage===
[[File:Red Bible - Carl W Ackerman - October 27, 1919.jpg|thumb|'''Red "Bible"''', a variation on ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', published in the ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'', Philadelphia, October 27, 1919, by Carl W. Ackerman]]

America's newspapers continually reinforced their readers' pro-American views and presented a negative attitude toward the Soviet Union and communism. They presented a threat of imminent conflict with the Soviet Union that would be justified by the clash with American ideals and goals.&lt;ref name="Kriesberg, Martin 1947"&gt;Kriesberg, Martin. "Soviet News in the 'New York Times'". ''The Public Opinion Quarterly'', Vol. 10. (Winter, 1946–1947): 540–564. JSTOR. 23 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, when ''The New York Times'' reported positively about the Soviet Union, it received less attention from the public than when it reported antagonistically about it. This did not hold true when Soviet interests agreed with American ones. As a result of this, the ''Times'' had a tendency to use exaggerated headlines, weighted words, and questionable sources in order to create a negative slant against the Soviets and communism. The tendency was to be very pro-American and theatrical in their coverage.&lt;ref name="Kriesberg, Martin 1947"/&gt;

The Red Scare led to the Western popularization of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. The text was purportedly brought to the United States by a Russian army officer in 1917; it was translated into English by [[Natalie de Bogory]] (personal assistant of [[Harris A. Houghton]], an officer of the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]]) in June 1918,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, N. ''Henry Ford and the Jews. The mass production of hate''. PublicAffair (2001), p. 82. {{ISBN|1891620525}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[White movement|White Russian]] expatriate [[Boris Brasol]] soon circulated it in American government circles, specifically diplomatic and military, in typescript form,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M. ''The American axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the rise of the Third Reich''. St. Martin's Press (2003), p. 60. {{ISBN|0312290225}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared in 1919 in the ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'' as a pair of serialized newspaper articles. But all references to "Jews" were replaced with references to ''[[Bolsheviki]]'' as an [[Investigative journalism|exposé]] by the journalist—and subsequently highly respected [[Columbia University]] School of Journalism dean—[[Carl W. Ackerman]]. Shortly thereafter it was adapted as "[[The International Jew]]" series in [[The Dearborn Independent]], establishing the myth of [[Jewish Bolshevism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p61ACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT190&amp;lpg=PT190&amp;dq=ackerman.+zion.+bolshevik&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SQs_6856AM&amp;sig=1A-Ll7ZMvv3419WlV06ZPKKXnVw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAhuCB_NLXAhWS3KQKHd4jAJcQ6AEIQDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Replaced%20every%20reference%20to%20Jews%20with%20Bolshevists&amp;f=false|title=Haters, Baiters and Would-Be Dictators: Anti-Semitism and the UK Far Right|last=Toczek|first=Nick|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=1317525876|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Sfn | Singerman | 1980 | pp = 48–78}}

===Film===
America's film industry reflected and exploited every aspect of the public's fascination with and fear of Bolshevism. ''The German Curse in Russia'' dramatized the German instigation of Russia's [[October Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 317&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet nationalization of women was central to the plot of ''The New Moon'', in which women between the ages of 23 and 32 are the property of the state and the heroine, [[Norma Talmadge]], is a Russian princess posing as a peasant during the Russian Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 179; Hanson, 657&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''The World and Its Woman'' starring [[Geraldine Farrar]], the daughter of an American engineer working in Russia becomes an opera star and has to fend off attempts to "nationalize" her.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 1069&lt;/ref&gt;

Several films used labor troubles as their setting, with an idealistic American hero and heroine struggling to outwit manipulative left-wing agitators.&lt;ref&gt;''Virtuous Men'', Hanson, 990; ''The Face at Your Window'', Hanson, 257; ''Uncharted Channels'', Hanson, 963–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In one interesting reversal of the usual plot elements, in ''Wolves of the Street'' Wall street profiteers foment a Bolshevik strike to ruin a competitor, the film's hero. Hanson, 1052–3&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dangerous Hours]]'' tells the story of an attempted Russian infiltration of American industry.&lt;ref&gt;Its working title was ''Americanism (Versus Bolshevism)'', Hanson, 187, the title of a pamphlet by [[Ole Hanson]], the mayor of Seattle who claimed to have broken the [[Seattle General Strike]] in 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; College graduate John King is sympathetic to the left in a general way. Then he is seduced, both romantically and politically, by Sophia Guerni, a female agitator. Her superior is the Bolshevik Boris Blotchi, who has a "wild dream of planting the scarlet seed of terrorism in American soil."&lt;ref name="Brownlow, 263"&gt;Brownlow, 263&lt;/ref&gt; Sofia and Boris turn their attention to the Weston shipyards that are managed by John's childhood sweetheart, May. The workers have valid grievances, but the Bolsheviks set out to manipulate the situation. They are "the dangerous element following in the wake of labor as riffraff and ghouls follow an army."&lt;ref name="Brownlow, 263"/&gt; When they threaten May, John has an epiphany and renounces revolutionary doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, 263; Hanson, 187&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer in ''Picture Play'' protested the film's stew of radical beliefs and strategies: "Please, oh please, look up the meaning of the words 'bolshevik' and 'soviet.' Neither of them mean [sic] 'anarchist,' 'scoundrel' or 'murderer' &amp;ndash; really they don't!"&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, 264&lt;/ref&gt;

Some films just used Bolsheviks for comic relief, where they are easily seduced (''The Perfect Woman'')&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 711&lt;/ref&gt; or easily inebriated (''Help Yourself'').&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 386&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Bullin the Bullsehviks'' an American named Lotta Nerve outwits Trotsky. New York State Senator [[Clayton R. Lusk]] spoke at the film's New York premiere in October 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 110&lt;/ref&gt; Other films used one feature or another of radical philosophy as the key plot point: anarchist violence (''The Burning Question''),&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 112&lt;/ref&gt; assassination and devotion to the red flag (''The Volcano''),&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 994. The film had a special showing for government officials and political leaders at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. on July 4, 1919 several weeks in advance of its release.&lt;/ref&gt; utopian vision (''[[Bolshevism on Trial]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising for ''Bolshevism on Trial'' called it "the timeliest picture ever filmed" and reviews were good. "Powerful, well-knit with indubitably true and biting satire," said ''[[Photoplay]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 178&lt;/ref&gt; As a promotion device, the April 15, 1919, issue of ''Moving Picture World'' suggested staging a mock radical demonstration by hanging red flags around town and then have actors in military uniforms storm in to tear them down. The promoter was then to distribute handbills to the confused and curious crowds to reassure them that ''Bolshevism on Trial'' takes a stand against Bolshevism and "you will not only clean up but will profit by future business."&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 175, 180&lt;/ref&gt; When this publicity technique came to the attention of U.S. Secretary of Labor [[William Bauchop Wilson|William B. Wilson]], he expressed his dismay to the press: "This publication proposes by deceptive methods of advertising to stir every community in the United States into riotous demonstrations for the purpose of making profits for the moving picture business&amp;nbsp; ..." He hoped to ban movies treating Bolshevism and Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other films were ''When Doctors Disagree'', Hanson, 1017, ''The Great Shadow'', Hanson, 351, and two films for which prints do not survive: ''Everybody's Business'', Hanson, 249, and ''Give and Take'', Hanson, 333&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
In 1919 Kansas enacted a law titled "An act relating to the flag, standard or banner of Bolshevism, anarchy or radical socialism" in an attempt to punish the display of the most common symbol of radicalism, the [[Red flag (politics)#Laws to ban red flags|red flag]]. Only Massachusetts (1913) and Rhode Island (1914) passed such "red flag laws" earlier. By 1920 they were joined by 24 more states.&lt;ref name="Franklin, 292"&gt;Franklin, 292&lt;/ref&gt; Some banned certain colors (red or black), or certain expressions ("indicating disloyalty or belief in anarchy" or "antagonistic to the existing government of the United States"), or certain contexts ("to overthrow the government by general strike"), or insignia ("flag or emblem or sign").&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, 292-3; Noggle, 107; Nelles, 3&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Yale Law Journal'' mocked the Connecticut law against symbols "calculated to&amp;nbsp; ... incite people to disorder," anticipating its enforcement at the next Harvard-Yale football game.&lt;ref name="Franklin, 292"/&gt; Ohio exempted college pennants and Wisconsin made an exception for historical museums.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, 293&lt;/ref&gt; Minnesota allowed red flags for railroad and highway warnings.&lt;ref&gt;Nelles, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Setting patriotic standards, red flag laws regulated the proper display of the American flag: above all other flags, ahead of all other banners in any parade, or flown only in association with state flags or the flags of friendly nations.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, 291&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment generally included fines from $1,000 to $5,000 and prison terms of 5 to 10 years, occasionally more.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, 294. On red flag laws generally, see Chafee, 180ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the federal level, the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and the amendments to it in the [[Sedition Act of 1918]] prohibited interference with the war effort, including many expressions of opinion. With that legislation rendered inoperative by the end of [[World War I]], Attorney General [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer|A. Mitchell Palmer]], supported by President Wilson,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, 87&lt;/ref&gt; waged a public campaign in favor of a peacetime version of the Sedition Act without success.&lt;ref name="Chafee, 195"&gt;Chafee, 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/11/16/archives/palmer-for-stringent-law-attorney-general-asks-senate-for-sedition.html "Palmer for Stringent Law," November 16, 1919]. Retrieved February 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He sent a circular outlining his rationale to newspaper editors in January 1919, citing the dangerous foreign-language press and radical attempts to create unrest in African American communities.&lt;ref&gt;Chafee, 195-6&lt;/ref&gt; At one point Congress had more than 70 versions of proposed language and amendments for such a bill,&lt;ref&gt;Chafee, 197&lt;/ref&gt; but it took no action on the controversial proposal during the campaign year of 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Nelles, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer called for every state to enact its own version of the Sedition Act.&lt;ref name="Chafee, 195"/&gt; Six states had laws of this sort before 1919 usually aimed at sabotage, but another 20 added them in 1919 and 1920. Usually called "anti-syndicalist laws," they varied in their language, but generally made it a crime to "destroy organized government" by one method or another, including "by the general cessation of industry," that is, through a general strike.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, 294-6; Chafe, 187ff. The authoritative study of this subject is Elbridge Foster Dowell, ''History of Criminal Syndicalist Legislation'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; Many cities had their own versions of these laws, including 20 in the state of Washington alone.&lt;ref&gt;Nelles, 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise==

===May Day 1920===
[[File:Come unto me, ye opprest.jpg|thumb|right|A political cartoon from the [[Memphis Commercial Appeal]] depicting an anarchist attempting to destroy the Statue of Liberty]]
Within Attorney General Palmer's Justice Department, the General Intelligence Division (GID) headed by [[J. Edgar Hoover]] had become a storehouse of information about radicals in America. It had infiltrated many organizations and, following the raids of November 1919 and January 1920, it had interrogated thousands of those arrested and read through boxes of publications and records seized. Though agents in the GID knew there was a gap between what the radicals promised in their rhetoric and what they were capable of accomplishing, they nevertheless told Palmer they had evidence of plans for an attempted overthrow of the U.S. government on May Day 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 234-5&lt;/ref&gt;

With Palmer's backing, Hoover warned the nation to expect the worst: assassinations, bombings, and general strikes. Palmer issued his own warning on April 29, 1920, claiming to have a "list of marked men"&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1920/04/30/archives/nationwide-plot-to-kill-high-officials-on-red-may-day-revealed-by.html "Nation-Wide Plot to Kill High Officials on Red May Day Revealed by Palmer," April 30, 1920]. Retrieved January 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and said domestic radicals were "in direct connection and unison" with European counterparts with disruptions planned for the same day there. Newspapers headlined his words: "Terror Reign by Radicals, says Palmer" and "Nation-wide Uprising on Saturday." Localities prepared their police forces and some states mobilized their militias. New York City's 11,000-man police force worked for 32 hours straight. Boston police mounted machine guns on automobiles and positioned them around the city.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 234-5; ''New York Times'': [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0DE2D91E31E03ABC4953DFB366838B639EDE "City under Guard against Red Plot Threatened Today," May 1, 1920]. Retrieved January 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The date came and went without incident. Newspaper reaction was almost uniform in its mockery of Palmer and his "hallucinations." [[Clarence Darrow]] called it the "May Day scare."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E07E2D81E31E03ABC4C53DFB366838B639EDE "Union Men Assail Palmer," May 4, 1920]. Retrieved January 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' asked the Attorney General to cease his alerts: "We can never get to work if we keep jumping sideways in fear of the bewiskered Bolshevik."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 253; Ackerman, 283-4&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Boston American'' assessed the Attorney General on May 4:&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, 283-4&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everybody is laughing at A. Mitchell Palmer's May Day "revolution." The joke is certainly on A. Mitchell Palmer, but the matter is not wholly a joke. The spectacle of a Cabinet officer going around surrounded with armed guards because he is afraid of his own hand-made bogey is a sorry one, even though it appeals to the humor of Americans. Of course, the terrible "revolution" did not come off. Nobody with a grain of sense supposed that it would. Yet, in spite of universal laughter, the people are seriously disgusted with these official Red scares. They cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars spent in assembling soldiers and policemen and in paying wages and expenses to Mr. Palmer's agents. They help to frighten capital and demoralize business, and to make timid men and women jumpy and nervous.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Palmer's embarrassment buttressed Louis Freeland Post's position in opposition to the Palmer raids when he testified before a Congressional Committee on May 7–8.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 235-6; Post, 238ff&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collapse===
Once Palmer's warnings of a May Day attempt to overthrow the government proved false, the anti-Bolshevik hysteria wound down quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Gage, 179-82&lt;/ref&gt; In testimony before Congress on May 7–8, Louis Freeland Post defended his release of hundreds seized in Palmer's raids so successfully that attempts to impeach or censure him ended.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, 277-80, 289-94&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the month, a dozen prominent lawyers including [[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[Roscoe Pound]] endorsed a report that condemned Palmer's Justice Department for the "utterly illegal acts committed by those charged with the highest duty of enforcing the laws" including entrapment, police brutality, prolonged incommunicado detention, and violations of due process in court.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''To the American People'', 4; Coben, 238-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Federal District Court]] Judge [[George Weston Anderson|George Anderson]] ordered the discharge of twenty more arrested aliens and effectively ended the possibility of additional raids.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 225-26&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative ''Christian Science Monitor'' found itself unable to support Palmer any longer, writing on June 25, 1920: "What appeared to be an excess of radicalism&amp;nbsp; ... was certainly met with&amp;nbsp; ... an excess of suppression."&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 226; Chafee, 198&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders of industry voiced similar sentiments, including [[Charles M. Schwab]] of [[Bethlehem Steel]], who thought Palmer's activities created more radicals than they suppressed, and [[T. Coleman du Pont]] who called the Justice Department's work evidence of "sheer Red hysteria."&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 239; on business leaders' denunciations of the deportations and defense of immigrants from charges of radicalism, see John Higham, ''Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism'' (NY: Atheneum, 1968), 232&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Democratic National Convention in July, Palmer never had a chance at winning the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;Pietrusza, 193-4&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge, famous for his opposition to the right of police to strike, won a place on the Republican ticket, but the party's nominee, and the eventual winner of the 1920 election, was the U.S. Senator from Ohio, [[Warren G. Harding]]. He sounded a very different note in mid-August. An interviewer wrote that "his jaws fairly snapped" when he said that "too much has been said about Bolshevism in America. It is quite true that there are enemies of Government within our borders. However, I believe their number has been greatly magnified. The American workman is not a Bolshevik; neither is the American employer an autocrat."&lt;ref&gt;Google Books: [https://books.google.com/books?id=izdk8r0svwcC&amp; Sherman Rogers, "Senator Harding on Labor,"]  in ''[[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]]'', vol. 125, August 18, 1920, 668-670, quote 670; quoted in part: Gage, 230-1. Harding had used anti-Bolshevik rhetoric earlier, but for his presidential campaign took a conciliatory stance on labor issues. See Randolph C. Downes, ''The Rise of Warren Gamaliel Harding, 1865-1920'' (Ohio State University Press, 1970), 260, 275-6, 319-22, 361, 600, 605-9&lt;/ref&gt;

When another anarchist [[Wall Street bombing|bomb exploded on Wall Street in September 1920]], newspaper response was comparatively restrained.&lt;ref&gt;Gage, 184-5&lt;/ref&gt; "More bombs may be exploded," wrote the ''New York Times'', "Other lives may be taken. But these are only hazards of a war which&amp;nbsp; ... must be faced calmly." If anarchists sought to make people fearful, "By keeping cool and firm we begin their defeat."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1920/09/18/archives/to-put-down-terrorists.html "To Put Down Terrorists," September 18, 1920].

Fisheries-induced evolution '''(FIE)''' is the [[microevolution]] of an exploited aquatic organism's population, brought on through the artificial selection for biological traits by [[Fishing techniques|fishing practices]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fishing, of any severity or effort, will impose an additional layer of mortality to the natural population equilibrium and will be selective to certain genetic traits within that organism's gene pool. This removal of selected traits fundamentally changes the population [[Allele frequency|gene frequency]], resulting in the artificially induced microevolution by the proxy of the survival of untargeted fish and their propagation of heritable biological characteristics. This artificial selection often counters natural [[Life history theory|life-history pattern]] for many species, such as causing early sexual maturation, diminished sizes for matured fish, and reduced fecundity in the form of smaller egg size, lower sperm counts and viability during reproductive events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These effects can have prolonged effects on the adaptability or fitness of the species to their environmental factors.  

Fisheries-induced evolution differ to the norm [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] evolution model by the direct human factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlson|first=Stephanie M.|last2=Edeline|first2=Eric|last3=Asbjørn Vøllestad|first3=L.|last4=Haugen|first4=Thrond. O.|last5=Winfield|first5=Ian J.|last6=Fletcher|first6=Janice M.|last7=Ben James|first7=J.|last8=Stenseth|first8=Nils Chr.|date=June 2007|title=Four decades of opposing natural and human-induced artificial selection acting on Windermere pike (Esox lucius)|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=512–521|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01046.x|pmid=17498150|issn=1461-023X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For FIE, fishing enforces a greater selection pressure for traits, often through sheer effort and catch numbers, which can disparage natural selection pressures such as predator-prey interactions and environmental influences.  

== Causes ==
Fishing practices that permanently remove animals from their population (i.e. not [[catch and release]]) drive direct fisheries-induced evolution by removing the genetic materials of those animals from the population. Individuals that are untargeted, through the selection bias of fishing gears and/or legislation, are allowed to reproduce and proliferate their genetic materials. As fishing pressures persist, traits belonging to non-selected organisms are preserved through survival and become more dominant in frequency within the gene pool. Additionally, fishing on a targeted species incur knock-on effects to those around it by its disturbance of their natural interactions. In these situations, specific traits of the untargeted species may be favourable under the diminutive presence, or absence, of the targeted species, and therefore indirectly selected for.      

=== Direct selection ===
The direct selection for biological traits through fishery practices is the result of fishery management regulations, and gear restrictions and selectivities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heino|first=Mikko|last2=Díaz Pauli|first2=Beatriz|last3=Dieckmann|first3=Ulf|date=2015-12-04|title=Fisheries-Induced Evolution|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=461–480|doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-112414-054339|issn=1543-592X|url=http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11318/1/HeinoEtAl2015-Fisheries-induced%20evolution%20IIASA%20AnnRevEcolEvolSyst.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious artificial selection for traits through management legislation can be observed in the imposed regulations on size, sex, seasonality, and locations.  

Catch size regulations vary with specificity to the targeted species and is often used to prevent exploitation during a specific part of the life cycle for the organism. Such regulations arose in response to the effects of FIE observed by the fisheries of Atlantic Cod (''[[Atlantic cod|Gadus morhua]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jakobsdóttir|first=Klara B.|last2=Pardoe|first2=Heidi|last3=Magnússon|first3=Árni|last4=Björnsson|first4=Höskuldur|last5=Pampoulie|first5=Christophe|last6=Ruzzante|first6=Daniel E.|last7=Marteinsdóttir|first7=Guðrún|date=2011-01-05|title=Historical changes in genotypic frequencies at the Pantophysin locus in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in Icelandic waters: evidence of fisheries-induced selection?|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=562–573|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00176.x|issn=1752-4571|pmc=3352422|pmid=25568005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the fishing technological revolution that has lead to the species moratorium, the exploitation of Atlantic Cod have been selective towards larger-sized fish since the 1500s. Catch data for the species have quantitatively shown that this selectivity for larger fish for over 500 years have shifted the life-history patterns, resulting in earlier sexual maturation and smaller sizes at said maturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Esben M.|last2=Heino|first2=Mikko|last3=Lilly|first3=George R.|last4=Morgan|first4=M.

Sexual selectivity by a fishery works on the theoretical foundation that the preservation of females allows their reproductive input to offset the fishing mortality. Fisheries of species with low fecundity such as mud crabs (''Scylla serrata'') and blue swimmer crabs (''Portunus armatus'') often adopt this method and only allow the harvesting of males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/business-priorities/fisheries/species-identification/inshore-estuarine-species/mud-crab|title=Mud crab (mangrove crab)|website=www.daf.qld.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The direct selection for traits, with respect to sex selectivity, occurs when specific characteristics or behaviours increase the susceptibility of the organisms for harvest. For example, corking wrasses (''[[Corkwing wrasse|Symphodus melops]]'') are harvested as a biological control for sea lice within farmed salmon facilities of the northern hemisphere. Male fish dominate these wild fisheries in both catch per unit effort and weight owing to their strong nesting behaviour and territorial nature, which differentiate them from females and sneaker males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/40796/19/Hanssen--Master-2014.pdf|title=Consequences of Selective Harvesting a Small Temperate Fish Species Displaying Strong Male Dimorphism, the Corking Wrasse (Symphodus melops)|last=Hanssen|first=Benjamin|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent fishing pressures over the years have reduced maturation age and size for these nesting males, in addition to increasing the density of sneaker males to the detriment of the localised population.    

=== Indirect selection ===
Indirect fishery-induced evolution occurs when a species with some level of ecological significance is targeted by a fishery, and their diminished presence within the ecology causes a flow on effect to other untargeted species. [[Keystone species|Keystone]] or [[Umbrella species|umbrella]] species provide many ecological services to the environment which they belong to, ranging from the provision of habitat and food, to the control of biodiversity by preventing any one organism from dominating. Removal or reduction of these organisms often cause significant changes to the behaviours and physiology of the organisms which were once controlled. 

Non-migratory reef sharks (''[[Blacktip reef shark|Carcharhinus melanopterus]], [[Grey reef shark|C. amblyrhynchos]],'' and ''[[Whitetip reef shark|Triaenodon obesus]]'') play the vital role in weeding out sick and ill-adapted individuals from within a population, in addition to controlling the abundance of larger size fish. Thus, these sharks are an ever-present mortality factor for many reef organisms. Fisheries targeting these apex predators inherently allow for the proliferation of medium-sized predatory fishes (e.g. barracudas, juvenile groupers, trevallies, snappers) at the expense of the cohabiting smaller species. When this happen, the FIE responses observed from smaller species have been consistent with their increasing egg production and shifted life-history for early sexual maturation.

Another example of FIE that is instigated indirectly can be seen in the ornamental or aquarium trade industry. In particular, [[Coral|corals]] and [[Sea anemone|anemones]] are highly prized ornamental commodities and are often harvested at unsustainable rates for profit within the Malay archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shuman|first=Craig S.|last2=Hodgson|first2=Gregor|last3=Ambrose|first3=Richard F.|date=2005-09-07|title=Population impacts of collecting sea anemones and anemonefish for the marine aquarium trade in the Philippines|journal=Coral Reefs|language=en|volume=24|issue=4|pages=564–573|doi=10.1007/s00338-005-0027-z|issn=0722-4028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of anemones at rates higher than their resettlement into the reefs, as observed in the Philippines, is known to have caused drastic reduction in the localised population of clownfish or anemonefish (''[[Amphiprioninae|Amphiprion sp.]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madduppa|first=Hawis H.|last2=von Juterzenka|first2=Karen|last3=Syakir|first3=Mohammad|last4=Kochzius|first4=Marc|date=November 2014|title=Socio-economy of marine ornamental fishery and its impact on the population structure of the clown anemonefish Amphiprion ocellaris and its host anemones in Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia|journal=Ocean &amp; Coastal Management|volume=100|pages=41–50|doi=10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2014.07.013|issn=0964-5691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionarily, anemone fish observed on reefs that were subjected to intense and prolonged anemone fishing were significantly smaller, even for mature adult pairs, than those found living with an anemone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frisch|first=Ashley J.|last2=Rizzari|first2=Justin R.|last3=Munkres|first3=Katherine P.|last4=Hobbs|first4=Jean-Paul A.|date=2016-01-21|title=Anemonefish depletion reduces survival, growth, reproduction and fishery productivity of mutualistic anemone–anemonefish colonies|journal=Coral Reefs|language=en|volume=35|issue=2|pages=375–386|doi=10.1007/s00338-016-1401-8|issn=0722-4028}}&lt;/ref&gt; This size reduction is attributed to their need to hide in small coral crevices in the absence of a host.

== Evidence ==
Outside of observational data collected from active fisheries, the evidence for fisheries-induced evolution, or its symptoms, may be discerned through both commercial and recreational anecdotes. These stories often articulate the diminishing catch, reduction in their weight and length records, in addition to the mandatory increase to fishing efforts over time to attain similar fishing quotas to their historical references. However, experimental data was needed to clarify two fundamental questions regarding FIE, so that the aforementioned ramifications of smaller sizes and early maturation may not be attributed to non-anthropogenic factors such as population flux. The two evidentiary questions: a) Is fishing pressure capable of changing the gene frequency of a population to cause microevolution within such a short time frame? b) How can non-selective fishing gears (gill nets and trawlers) be selective for certain traits?  

=== Experimental evidence ===
The implementation of aquaculture experimental designs afford the possibility of isolating different biological traits and observing their impacts and heredity within a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=Roger W.|date=June 1986|title=An approach to the quantitative analysis of domestication selection in aquaculture|journal=Aquaculture|volume=33|issue=1–4|pages=167–185|doi=10.1016/0044-8486(83)90398-8|issn=0044-8486}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A study by Solberg et al. (2013) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solberg|first=Monica Favnebøe|last2=Skaala|first2=Øystein|last3=Nilsen|first3=Frank|last4=Glover|first4=Kevin Alan|date=2013-01-31|title=Does Domestication Cause Changes in Growth Reaction Norms? A Study of Farmed, Wild and Hybrid Atlantic Salmon Families Exposed to Environmental Stress|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=e54469|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0054469|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3561353|pmid=23382901}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that with sufficient fishing pressure and selectivity, a substantial change to a population genotype may be achieved without the geological time-frame often associated with evolution. In this study, Atlantic salmon (''[[Atlantic salmon|Salmo salar]]'') were subjected to a modified '[[Transplant experiment|common garden]]' design, and the researchers isolated stress as an abiotic independent variable to the growth rates of salmon. By selecting for fish with a lower biological response to stress, a domesticated population was created within 10 generations of breeding, which exhibited a threefold increase in growth rate over its wild counterpart. Thus, the difference between the absence of larger fish, which can be misattributed to overfishing, and FIE lies in the inherited biological characteristics that were untargeted by fishing.   

Fishing techniques such as [[Gillnetting|gill nets]] and [[Trawling#Environmental%20effects|trawling]] are often associated with a lack of selectivity within the environment which they are operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milton|first=David A.|last2=Die|first2=David|last3=Tenakanai|first3=Charles|last4=Swales|first4=Stephen|date=1998|title=Selectivity for barramundi (Lates calcarifer) in the Fly River, Papua New Guinea: implications for managing gill-net fisheries on protandrous fishes|url=https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF98065|journal=Marine and Freshwater Research|language=en|volume=49|issue=6|pages=499|doi=10.1071/mf98065|issn=1323-1650}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to establish whether selectivity can occur under these practices, when fishing data suggest that an entire localised population may be caught or up to 80% of the effort to go to bycatches and not the targeted species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=R.W.D.|last2=Cripps|first2=S.J.|last3=Nickson|first3=A.|last4=Porter|first4=G.|date=July 2009|title=Defining and estimating global marine fisheries bycatch|journal=Marine Policy|volume=33|issue=4|pages=661–672|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2009.01.003|issn=0308-597X}}&lt;/ref&gt; An experiment by Biro and Post (2008) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biro|first=Peter A.|last2=Post|first2=John R.|date=2008-02-26|title=Rapid depletion of genotypes with fast growth and bold personality traits from harvested fish populations|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/8/2919|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=105|issue=8|pages=2919–2922|doi=10.1073/pnas.0708159105|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2268560|pmid=18299567}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that despite being mechanically unselective of gill nets, behavioural variation in certain fish species can indeed affect the likelihood of them being caught and therefore be a function for selectivity. Using a ‘[[Experimental evolution|selection experiment]] in the field’ model, two genotypes of rainbow trouts (''[[Rainbow trout|Oncorhynchus mykiss]]'') were transplanted into identical artificial lake habitats and subjected to matching gill net fishing pressures. The net in question were designed to capture all size variability within the simulated populations. Trouts exhibiting the genotypes for faster growth rates and therefore a more active lifestyle were found to have a 60% increase chance to be caught in comparison to those characterised by the more sedentary genotype. Therefore, for 'non-selective' fishing methods, the selecting factor rests not on the gear itself but on the inherent behavioural variations within the population.

== Implications ==
Fisheries-induced evolution is a function of the fishing-induced genetic drift, and to some extent represent the reduction of genetic diversity within the targeted population. For many exploited population, this reduction in genetic diversity has been predicted to reduce their adaptability to both environmental variability and ecological competitiveness.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuparinen|first=Anna|last2=Hutchings|first2=Jeffrey A.|date=2012-07-07|title=Consequences of fisheries-induced evolution for population productivity and recovery potential|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1738/2571|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=279|issue=1738|pages=2571–2579|doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.0120|issn=0962-8452|pmc=3350703|pmid=22398166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the commonly observed fisheries-induced adaptation of younger and smaller size at sexual maturation counter specific life-history characteristics that would enable interspecies competition for resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marty|first=Lise|last2=Dieckmann|first2=Ulf|last3=Ernande|first3=Bruno|date=January 2015|title=Fisheries-induced neutral and adaptive evolution in exploited fish populations and consequences for their adaptive potential|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4310581/|journal=Evolutionary Applications|volume=8|issue=1|pages=47–63|doi=10.1111/eva.12220|issn=1752-4571|pmc=4310581|pmid=25667602}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biological model by Kindsvater and Palkovacs (2017) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kindsvater|first=Holly K.|last2=Palkovacs|first2=Eric P.|date=September 2017|title=Predicting Eco-evolutionary Impacts of Fishing on Body Size and Trophic Role of Atlantic Cod|journal=Copeia|language=en-US|volume=105|issue=3|pages=475–482|doi=10.1643/ot-16-533|issn=0045-8511}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that FIE Atlantic cod, due to their smaller sizes, actually belong to a lower trophic level irrespective of their original position prior to the species moratorium. Furthermore, the FIE effect of reducing egg counts and their viability have weakened the number of recruitments back into the population after spawning, thereby reducing the localised population density. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enberg|first=Katja|last2=Jørgensen|first2=Christian|last3=Dunlop|first3=Erin S.|last4=Heino|first4=Mikko|last5=Dieckmann|first5=Ulf|date=2009-07-31|title=ORIGINAL ARTICLE: Implications of fisheries-induced evolution for stock rebuilding and recovery|journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=394–414|doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2009.00077.x|issn=1752-4571|pmc=3352485|pmid=25567888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pardo|first=Luis M.|last2=Riveros|first2=Marcela P.|last3=Fuentes|first3=Juan Pablo|last4=Pinochet|first4=Ramona|last5=Cárdenas|first5=Carla|last6=Sainte-Marie|first6=Bernard|date=2017-05-13|title=High fishing intensity reduces females' sperm reserve and brood fecundity in a eubrachyuran crab subject to sex- and size-biased harvest|url=https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/74/9/2459/3823336|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|language=en|volume=74|issue=9|doi=10.1093/icesjms/fsx077|issn=1054-3139}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the reduced population abundance and smaller sizes, the increase in ''per capita'' resource has been stipulated to counteract the effects of competitions between different species by reducing intraspecific interactions, which can allow for maximal density-dependent growth to happen. This also means that for harvesting to be sustainable, yearly or seasonal assessment of viable reproductive stocks and their recruitment rates must be performed to account for the compromised fecundity and recovery statuses.   

There is limited data on the interactions between FIE affected species and their robustness to environmental fluctuations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For many species, the additional mortality rate and the frequency of harvesting exerted by the fisheries make it difficult to elucidate how environmental factors such as temperatures, salinity and currents can be beneficial or detrimental for stocks, since their effects on deaths or recruitment gains are diminutive in comparison. However, with the rapidly evolving climates stemming from the anthropogenic inputs, an understanding of how FIE affects the adaptability of these aquatic population will be necessary, not only for future stock assessments, but also sustainable harvesting.

'''''Freedom of Worship''''' or '''''Freedom to Worship''''' is the second of the ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]'' oil paintings produced by the American artist [[Norman Rockwell]]. The series was based on the goals known as the [[Four Freedoms]] enunciated by the 32nd President of the United States, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], in his [[State of the Union Address]] delivered on January 6, 1941.  Rockwell considered this painting and ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' the most successful of the series. ''Freedom of Worship'' was published on the 27th of February, 1943, issue of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' alongside an essay by philosopher [[Will Durant]].

==Background==
''Freedom of Worship'' is the second of a series of four oil paintings by [[Norman Rockwell]] entitled ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]''. The works were inspired by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[State of the Union Address]] delivered to the [[77th United States Congress]] on January 6, 1941, known as [[Four Freedoms]].&lt;ref name="U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page70.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412075512/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page70.htm|archivedate=April 12, 2008|title=100 Documents That Shaped America:President Franklin Roosevelt's Annual Message (Four Freedoms) to Congress (1941)|accessdate=April 11, 2008|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the [[United States Constitution]] are [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=FSP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203440104574406903628933162|title=Free Speech Personified: Norman Rockwell's inspiring and enduring painting|accessdate=December 31, 2013|date=October 10, 2009|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Cole, Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Four Freedoms' theme was later incorporated into the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' World War II policy statement, the [[Atlantic Charter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VjcHPR2lfcC&amp;pg=PA49|title=2048: Humanity's Agreement to Live Together|author=Boyd, Kirk|isbn=1-4596-2515-3|page=12|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhhecYMgUNsC&amp;pg=PA287|title=The Kravchenko Case: One Man's War on Stalin|author=Kern, Gary|isbn=1-929631-73-1|page=287|publisher=Enigma Books|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became part of the charter of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P"/&gt; The series of paintings ran on four consecutive weeks in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', accompanied by essays from noted writers: ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' (February 20), ''Freedom of Worship'' (February 27), ''[[Freedom from Want (painting)|Freedom from Want]]'' (March 6) and ''[[Freedom from Fear (painting)|Freedom from Fear]]'' (March 13).&lt;ref name=NRFF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countrymanpress.com/titles/NormanRockwellsFourFreedoms.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814161913/http://www.countrymanpress.com/titles/NormanRockwellsFourFreedoms.html|archivedate=August 14, 2007|title=Norman Rockwell's Four Freedoms|accessdate=April 11, 2008|publisher=The Countryman Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the essay accompanying ''Freedom of Worship'', ''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs chose Durant, who was a best-selling author at the peak of his fame. At the time, Durant was in the midst of working on his ten-volume ''[[The Story of Civilization]]'', coauthored with his wife, [[Ariel Durant]]. Will Durant also lectured on history and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the series of paintings became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the [[Series E bond|U.S. Government War Bond]] Drive.&lt;ref name=AASfaWP&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E5D91E3CF937A25753C1A9679C8B63|title= Art/Architecture; Salve for a Wounded People|accessdate=April 7, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 14, 2001|author=Marling, Karal Ann|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080415212052/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E5D91E3CF937A25753C1A9679C8B63 |archivedate = April 15, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ILTPP/&gt;&lt;ref name=HaK102&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{quote box|width=27em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way—everywhere in the world."|source=—[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s January 6, 1941 [[State of the Union address]] introducing the theme of the [[Four Freedoms]]}}
The painting shows the profiles of eight heads in a modest space. The various figures represent people of different faiths in a moment of prayer. Particularly, three figures on the bottom row (right to left): a man with [[Kippah|his head covered]] carrying a religious book who is [[American Jews|Jewish]], an older woman who is [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]], and a younger woman with a well-lit face holding [[rosary beads]] who is [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]].&lt;ref name=S209/&gt; In 1966, Rockwell used ''Freedom of Worship'' to show his admiration for [[John F. Kennedy]] in a ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' story illustration entitled ''JFK's Bold Legacy''. The work depicts Kennedy in profile in a composition similar to ''Freedom of Worship'' along with [[Peace Corps]] volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Freedom of Worship original draft.jpg|thumb|The original draft of ''Freedom of Worship'' was set in a barbershop.]]
The original version of the painting was set in a barbershop with patrons of a variety of religions and races all waiting their turn in the barber's chair.&lt;ref name=S207&gt;Solomon, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; His first workup was a {{convert|41|×|33|in|cm|adj=on}} oil on canvas depicting tolerance as "the basis for a democracy's religious diversity". It included a Jew being served by a Protestant barber as a black man and a Roman Catholic priest awaited the barber's services.&lt;ref name=C311&gt;Claridge, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was painting easily recognizable depictions of different religions and races because there was little agreement on what a person of a certain religion should look like.&lt;ref name=HaK100&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as he attempted to clarify the characters' depictions he found himself resorting to offensive overexaggeration, especially of the non-clerical characters. Making a Jewish man appear stereotypically Semitic, making a white customer preppy and relegating the black man to agrarian workman attire bogged down the work without speaking on behalf of the government as it should.&lt;ref name=C311-2&gt;Claridge, pp.&amp;nbsp;311–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell's intended theme was religious tolerance, but he felt the original composition did not successfully make this point.&lt;ref name=S209&gt;Solomon, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1942, ''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs became supportive of Rockwell's Four Freedoms sketches,&lt;ref name=AASfaWP/&gt;&lt;ref name=HaK96&gt;Hennessey and Knutson, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and gave Rockwell two months to complete the works.&lt;ref name=S204&gt;Solomon, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; By October, the ''Post'' was worried about Rockwell's progress on the ''Four Freedoms'' and sent their art editor to Arlington to evaluate. At that time Rockwell was working on ''Freedom of Worship'', his second painting in the series.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell spent two months (October and most of November 1942)&lt;ref name=S209/&gt; on this work, that was inspired by the phrase "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience." His [[Arlington, Vermont]], neighbors served as his models: Three months pregnant with her hair upbraided, Rose Hoyt posed as a Catholic with a rosary,&lt;ref name=M128&gt;Meyer, pp. 128–33.&lt;/ref&gt; even though she was actually Protestant of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref name=S209/&gt;&lt;ref name=M128/&gt; Other models were a Mrs. Harrington, Rockwell's carpenter Walter Squires, Squire's wife Clara Squires (at the right-hand edge), Winfield Secoy, and Jim Martin (center).&lt;ref name=M128/&gt; His final version relied on other visual clues, including a rosary and a religious book. The work had dark-skinned black worshipers juxtaposed on the edges. This placement did not rock the boat with ''The Post'' who had not yet featured blacks prominently on its pages. Rockwell said he made these ethnics palatable by "'furtively' painting the face of the black woman at the top; the man at the bottom, with his [[fez (hat)|fez]], was too obviously foreign to offend."&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;  The image is commonly enhanced and often darkened in reproduction because it uses a color combination of soft greys, beiges and browns.  The paint was applied thinly, which allows the weave of the canvas to contribute to the image.&lt;ref name="HaK102"/&gt;

Rockwell has stated that he feels hands are second only to heads in importance to the expression of a story. He stated with regards to ''Freedom of Worship'', "I depended on the hands alone to convey about half of the message I wish to put over."&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell's extensive effort on this work was due to his belief that religion "is an extremely delicate subject. It is so easy to hurt so many people's feelings."&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;

==Critical review==
''Post'' editor Ben Hibbs said of ''Speech'' and ''Worship'', "To me they are great human documents in the form of paint and canvas. A great picture, I think is one which moves and inspires millions of people. The ''Four Freedoms'' did&amp;nbsp;— and do."&lt;ref name="MaM 59"&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Disney]] wrote, "I thought your Four Freedoms were great. I especially loved the Freedom of Worship and the composition and symbolism expressed in it."&lt;ref name="MaM 69"&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell believed that ''Freedom of Worship'' and ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' were his better results in the series.&lt;ref name=HaK102/&gt; [[Laura Claridge]] has written that the inspirational phrase "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience" is a "platitude that suggests the plurality of Rockwell's own thoughts on religion: its likely source was a phrase included in the ''[[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Thirteen Articles of Faith]]'' by [[Joseph Smith]]."&lt;ref name=C312&gt;Claridge, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Rockwell repeatedly asked colleagues about possible sources of the quote and was not told about Smith's writing until after the series was published.&lt;ref name=MaM50/&gt; The expression "according to the dictates of his conscience" (or a similar variation) was used in many United States state constitutions in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhqOopdewZMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Blueprint for Judicial Reform|author1=McGuian, Patrick B. |author2=Rader, Randall R.|isbn=978-0-942522-08-2|pages=301–5|publisher=The Free Congress Research and Education Foundation|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical review of the painting shows that some practitioners of particular faiths are disappointed by the acceptance of all faiths expressed in ''Freedom of Religion''.&lt;ref name=ILTPP&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,766759,00.html|title=I Like To Please People|accessdate=April 7, 2008|date=June 21, 1943|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claridge feels that &lt;blockquote&gt;the tight amalgam of faces&amp;nbsp;... and even the crepey skin on elderly hands, which have become the objects of worship, push the theme over the edge from idealistic tolerance into gooey sentiment, where human differences seem caught up in a magical moment of dispensation from the Light. The restraint demanded by art that deals with heightened emotion is lacking.&lt;ref name=C312/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Claridge stated that the earlier version was "clean, impressively sparse, in counterpoise to a dense narrative content. Beautifully painted even at the preliminary oil sketch stage."&lt;ref name=C312&gt;Claridge, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray and McCabe note that the work is a divergence from the "storytelling style" that Rockwell is known for.&lt;ref name=MaM50&gt;Murray and McCabe, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deborah Solomon]] considers the painting the least satisfactory of the series as she feels it is congested and somewhat "didactic".&lt;ref name=S209/&gt;  Maureen Hart Hennessey, chief curator of the [[Norman Rockwell Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/bio_1706.html|title=Maureen Hart Hennessey|accessdate=June 29, 2014|publisher=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and curator Anne Knutson consider the scale of the picture that only shows heads and hands in prayer as disruptive.&lt;ref name=HaK100/&gt; Bruce Cole of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' noted that Rockwell's "depiction of spectral close-up faces and hands raised in prayer is bland, without any real message about religious freedom—again, no wallop. This is because faith, like the absence of fear and the absence of want, is essentially private, something personal, intangible and unpicturable."&lt;ref name="FSP"/&gt;

'''Friendship''' is a relationship of mutual [[affection]] between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford Dictionary Press |title=Definition for friend |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/friend |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friendship is a stronger form of [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal bond]] than an association. Friendship has been studied in academic fields such as [[Communication studies|communication]], [[sociology]], [[social psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[philosophy]]. Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including [[social exchange theory]], [[equity theory]], [[relational dialectics]], and [[attachment styles]].

Although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many types of such bonds. Such characteristics include affection; [[kindness]], [[love]], [[virtue]], [[sympathy]], [[empathy]], [[honesty]], [[altruism]], [[loyalty]], mutual [[understanding]] and [[compassion]], enjoyment of each other's company, [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and the ability to be oneself, express one's feelings to others, and make mistakes without fear of judgment from the friend.

==Developmental psychology==
===Childhood===
[[Image:Childhood friends at a carnival.jpg|thumb|Childhood friends]]
The understanding of friendship in children tends to be more heavily focused on areas such as common activities, physical proximity, and shared expectations.&lt;ref name="bremner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremner|first1=J. Gavin|title=An Introduction to Developmental Psychology|date=May 8, 2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405186520|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-YGCwAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|498}}{{efn|In comparison to older respondents, who tend to describe friendship in terms of psychological rather than mostly physical aspects.&lt;ref name="bremner"/&gt;{{rp|498}}}} These friendships provide opportunity for [[Play (activity)|playing]] and practicing [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]].&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|246}} Most children tend to describe friendship in terms of things like [[sharing]], and children are more likely to share with someone they consider to be a friend.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|246}}&lt;ref name="Newman, B. M. 2012"&gt;Newman, B. M. &amp; Newman, P.R. (2012). Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach.

They gain the ability to empathize with their friends, and enjoy playing in groups. They also experience peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years. Establishing good friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society later on in their life.&lt;ref name="Newman, B. M. 2012"/&gt;

Based upon the reports of teachers and mothers, 75% of preschool children had at least one friend. This figure rose to 78% through the [[fifth grade]], as measured by co-nomination as friends, and 55% had a mutual best friend.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|247}} About 15% of children were found to be chronically friendless, reporting periods without mutual friends at least six months.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|250}}

Potential benefits of friendship include the opportunity to learn about empathy and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2013|title= What Friends Teach Children|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201305/what-friends-teach-children}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coaching from parents can be useful in helping children to make friends.

===Adolescence===
[[File:Bhutan, Friends - Flickr - babasteve.jpg|thumb|Two friends in Bhutan]]
In adolescence, friendships become "more giving, sharing, frank, supportive, and spontaneous." Adolescents tend to seek out peers who can provide such qualities in a [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocal relationship]], and to avoid peers whose problematic behavior suggest they may not be able to satisfy these needs.&lt;ref name="reisman"/&gt; Relationships begin to maintain a focus on shared values, [[loyalty]], and common interests, rather than physical concerns like proximity and access to play things that more characterize childhood.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|246}}

A study performed at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] examined over 9,000 American adolescents to determine how their engagement in problematic behavior (such as stealing, fighting, and truancy) was related to their friendships. Findings indicated that adolescents were less likely to engage in problem behavior when their friends did well in school, participated in school activities, avoided drinking, and had good [[mental health]]. The opposite was found regarding adolescents who did engage in problematic behavior. Whether adolescents were influenced by their friends to engage in problem behavior depended on how much they were exposed to those friends, and whether they and their friendship groups "fit in" at school.&lt;ref&gt;Crosnoe, R., &amp; Needham, B. (2004) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15015689 Holism, contextual variability, and the study of friendships in adolescent development]. [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers from [[Purdue University]] found that friendships formed during [[Higher education|post-secondary education]] last longer than friendships formed earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Glenn (August 7, 2007).

===Adulthood===
[[File:3 barefoot females smiling and sitting on a bench.jpg|thumb|Friendships in adulthood]]
Friendship in adulthood provides companionship, affection, as well as emotional support, and contributes positively to mental well-being and improved physical health.&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schulz|first1=Richard|title=The Encyclopedia of Aging: Fourth Edition, 2-Volume Set|date=2006|publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer Publishing Company]]|isbn=9780826148445|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tgS29D0Mr4gC|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|426}}

Adults may find it particularly difficult to maintain meaningful friendships in the workplace. "The workplace can crackle with competition, so people learn to hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues. Work friendships often take on a transactional feel; it is difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Alex|title=Friends of a Certain Age: Why Is It Hard To Make Friends Over 30?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 25, 2012|date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most adults value the financial security of their jobs more than friendship with coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Susan|title=Workplace Friendships: Asset or Liability?|url=http://career-advice.monster.com/in-the-office/workplace-issues/workplace-friendships-asset-or-liab/article.aspx|website=[[Monster.com]]|accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of adults have an average of two close friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/8876376/Most-adults-have-only-two-close-friends.html|title=Most adults have 'only two close friends'|date=November 8, 2011|last=Willis|first=Amy|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=August 11, 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies with adults suggest that friendships and other supportive relationships do enhance self-esteem.&lt;ref name="www2.psych.purdue.edu"&gt;Berndt, T. J. (2002). [http://www2.psych.purdue.edu/~berndt/Friendship%20quality%20and%20social%20development.pdf Friendship Quality and Social Development]. American Psychological Society. [[Purdue University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Older adults===
[[Old age|Older adults]] continue to report high levels of personal satisfaction in their friendships as they age, and even as the overall number of friends tends to decline. This satisfaction is associated with an increased ability to accomplish [[activities of daily living]], as well as a reduced decline in [[Cognition|cognitive abilities]], decreased instances of hospitalization, and better outcomes related to [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt;{{rp|427}} The overall number of reported friends in later life may be mediated by increased lucidity, better speech and vision, and marital status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blieszner|first1=Rosemary|last2=Adams|first2=Rebecca G.|title=Adult Friendship|date=Jun 10, 1992|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780803936737|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGs5DQAAQBAJ|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}}

As on review phrased it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Research within the past four decades has now consistently found that older adults reporting the highest levels of happiness and general well being also report strong, close ties to numerous friends.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Jon F.|last2=Federowicz|first2=Molly|last3=Nussbaum|first3=Paul D.|title=Brain Health and Optimal Engagement for Older Adults|date=February 9, 2010|publisher=Editorial Aresta S.C.|isbn=9788493744007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwxrMe5Fo6QC|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As family responsibilities and vocational pressures lessen, friendships become more important. Among the elderly, friendships can provide links to the larger community, serve as a protective factor against depression and loneliness, and compensate for potential losses in social support previously given by family members.&lt;ref name="yearbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burleson|first1=Brant R.|title=Communication Yearbook 19|date=Mar 22, 2012|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9780415873178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8mMAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32-3}} Especially for people who cannot go out as often, interactions with friends allow for continued societal interaction. Additionally, older adults in declining health who remain in contact with friends show improved psychological well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Exploring-Lifespan-Development-3E/9780205957385.page|title=Pearson – Exploring Lifespan Development, 3/E|author=Laura E. Berk|year=2014|pages=696|isbn=9780205957385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental issues==

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===
Children with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) may have difficulty forming and maintaining friendships, due to a limited ability to build [[social skills]] through [[observational learning]], difficulties attending to [[social cues]], and because of the social impacts of [[impulsive behavior]] and a greater tendency to engage in behavior that may be seen as disruptive by their peers.&lt;ref name="hoza"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiener|first1=Judith|last2=Schneider|first2=Barry H.|title=A multisource exploration of the friendship patterns of children with and without learning disabilities|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|date=2002|volume=30|issue=2|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11369370|pages=127–41|accessdate=26 September 2017|pmid=12002394}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 review, no treatment was identified which effectively address peer functioning in children with ADHD, and treatments which addressed other aspects of the disorder were not found to eliminate issues related to peer functioning.&lt;ref name="hoza"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoza|first1=Betsy|title=Peer Functioning in Children With ADHD|journal=''Journal of Pediatric Psychology''|date=June 7, 2007|volume=32|issue=6|pages=101–106|doi=10.1016/j.ambp.2006.04.011|pmid=17261489|pmc=2572031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism===
Certain symptoms of [[autism spectrum]] disorders can interfere with the formation of interpersonal relations, such as a preference for routine actions, resistance to change, obsession with particular interests or rituals, and a lack of [[social skills]]. Children with autism have been found to be more likely to be close friends of one person, rather than having groups of friends. Additionally, they are more likely to be close friends of other children with some sort of a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauminger|first1=Nirit|last2=Solomon |first2=Marjorie |last3=Aviezer|first3=Anat|last4=Heung|first4=Kelly|last5=Gazit|first5=Lilach|last6=Brown|first6=John|last7=Rogers|first7=Sally J.|title=Children with Autism and Their Friends: A Multidimensional Study of Friendship in High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|date=3 January 2008|volume=36|issue=2|pages=135–150|doi=10.1007/s10802-007-9156-x|pmid=18172754}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of parental attachment aids in the quality of friendships in children with autism spectrum disorders; a sense of attachment with one's parents compensates for a lack of social skills that would usually inhibit friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauminger|first1=Nirit|last2=Solomon|first2=Marjorie|last3=Rogers|first3=Sally J.|title=Predicting Friendship Quality in Autism Spectrum Disorders and Typical Development|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=29 December 2009|volume=40|issue=6|pages=751–761|doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0928-8|pmid=20039110|pmc=2864904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done by Frankel et al. showed that parental intervention and instruction plays an important role in such children developing friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frankel|first1=Fred|last2=Myatt|first2=Robert|last3=Sugar|first3=Catherine|author3-link=Catherine Sugar|last4=Whitham|first4= Cynthia|last5=Gorospe|first5=Clarissa M.|last6=Laugeson|first6=Elizabeth|title=A Randomized Controlled Study of Parent-assisted Children's Friendship Training with Children having Autism Spectrum Disorders|journal= Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=8 January 2010|volume=40|issue=7|pages=827–842|doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0932-z|pmid=20058059|pmc=2890979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with parental intervention, school professionals play an important role in teaching social skills and peer interaction. Paraprofessionals, specifically one-on-one aides and classroom aides, are often placed with children with autism spectrum disorders in order to facilitate friendships and guide the child in making and maintaining substantial friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rossetti|first1=Zachary|first2=Deborah|last2=Goessling|title=Paraeducators' Roles in Facilitating Friendships Between Secondary Students With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorders or Developmental Disabilities|journal=Teaching Exceptional Children|date=July–August 2010|volume=42|series=6|pages=64–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although lessons and training may help peers of children with autism, bullying is still a major concern in social situations. According to Anahad O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', bullying is most likely to occur against children with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s who have the most potential to live independently. Such children are more at risk because they have as many of the rituals and lack of social skills as children with full autism, but they are more likely to be [[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstreamed]] in school, since they are on the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Children with autism have more difficulty attending to [[social cue]]s, and so may not always recognize when they are being bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Connor|first=Anahad|title=School Bullies Prey on Children With Autism|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/school-bullies-prey-on-children-with-autism/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Down syndrome===
Children with [[Down syndrome]] have increased difficulty forming friendships. They experience a [[language delay]] causing them to have a harder time playing with other children. Most children with Down syndrome may prefer to watch other students and play ''alongside'' a friend but not ''with'' them, mostly because they understand more than they can outwardly express. In preschool years, children with Down syndrome can benefit from the classroom setting, surrounded by other children and less dependent on adult aid. Children with this disability benefit from a variety of interactions with both adults and children. At school, ensuring an inclusive environment in the classroom can be difficult, but proximity to close friends can be crucial for social development.&lt;ref&gt;"Recreation &amp; Friendship."

==Health==
Studies have found that strong social supports improve a persons's prospects for good health and longevity. Conversely, loneliness and a lack of social supports have been linked to an increased risk of [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], viral [[infection]]s, and [[cancer]], as well as higher mortality rates overall. Two researchers have even termed friendship networks a "behavioral [[vaccine]]" that boosts both physical and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Friendship, social support, and health. 2007 Sias, Patricia M; Bartoo, Heidi. In L'Abate, Luciano. ''Low-cost approaches to promote physical and mental health: Theory, research, and practice''. (pp. 455–472). xxii, 526 pp. New York, NY, US: Springer Science + Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is a large body of research linking friendship and health, but the precise reasons for the connection remain unclear. Most of the studies in this area are large [[Prospective cohort study|prospective studies]] that follow people over time, and while there may be a [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation]] between the two variables (friendship and health status), researchers still do not know if there is a cause and effect relationship, such as the notion that good friendships actually improve health. A number of theories have attempted to explain this link. These theories have included that good friends encourage their friends to lead more healthy lifestyles; that good friends encourage their friends to seek help and access services when needed; that good friends enhance their friends' coping skills in dealing with illness and other health problems; and that good friends actually affect physiological pathways that are protective of health.&lt;ref&gt;Social networks and health: It's time for an intervention trial. 2005. Jorm, Anthony F. Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health. Vol 59(7) Jul 2005, 537–538.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===
The lack of friendship has been found to play a role in increasing risk of [[suicidal ideation]] among female adolescents, including having more friends who were not themselves friends with one another. However, no similar effect was observed for males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friendships play key role in suicidal thoughts of girls, but not boys|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2004-01/osu-fpk010604.php|website=EurekAlert!|publisher=[[Ohio State University]]|accessdate=26 September 2017|date=January 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bearman|first1=Peter S.|last2=Moody|first2=James|title=Suicide and Friendships Among American Adolescents|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=January 1, 2004|volume=94|issue=1|pages=89–95|doi=10.2105/AJPH.94.1.89|pmid=14713704|pmc=1449832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having few or no friends is a major indicator in the diagnosis of a range of [[mental disorders]].&lt;ref name="reisman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reisman|first1=John M.|title=Friendship and its Implications for Mental Health or Social Competence|journal=The Journal of Early Adolescence|date=September 1, 1985|volume=5|issue=3|pages=383–91|doi=10.1177/0272431685053010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher friendship quality directly contributes to self-esteem, self-confidence, and social development.&lt;ref name="www2.psych.purdue.edu"/&gt; A [[World Database of Happiness|World Happiness Database]] study found that people with close friendships are happier, although the absolute number of friends did not increase happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23097143 | work=BBC News | title=Can we make ourselves happier? | date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;Other studies have suggested that children who have friendships of a high quality may be protected against the development of certain disorders, such as anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brendgen | first1 = M. | last2 = Vitaro | first2 = F. | last3 = Bukowski | first3 = W.

==Dissolution==
The dissolution of a friendship may be viewed as a personal rejection, or may be the result of natural changes over time, as friends grow more distant both physically and emotionally. The disruption of friendships has been associated with increased [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anger]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and may be highly stressful events, especially in childhood. However, potential negative effects can be mitigated if the dissolution of a friendship is replaced with another close relationship.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|248}}

==Demographics==
Friends tend to be more similar to one another in terms of age, gender, behavior, [[substance abuse]], personal disposition, and academic performance.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|248}}&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt;{{rp|426}}&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt;{{rp|55–6}} In [[Multiculturalism|ethnically diverse]] countries, there is broad evidence that children and adolescents tend to form friendships with others of the same race or ethnicity, beginning in [[preschool]], and peaking in middle or late childhood.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zelazo|first1=Philip David|title=The Oxford Handbook of Developmental Psychology, Vol. 2: Self and Other|date=Mar 14, 2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199958474|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5m_D4NYVRI8C|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|264}}

===Gender differences===
In general, female-female friendship interactions among children tend to be more focused on interpersonal connections and [[social support|mutual support]], while male-male interaction tends to be more focused on [[social status]], and may actively discourage the expression of emotional needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Margaret|title=Developmental Psychology: A Student's Handbook|date=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781841691923|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yLl11fWXr8C|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|320-2}} Females report more anxiety, jealousy, and relational victimization and less stability related to their friendships, and males report higher levels of physical victimization. Although males and females tend to report comparative levels of satisfaction with their friendships.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;{{rp|249–50}}

Among older adults, women tend to be more socially adept than their male peers, and many older men may rely upon a female companion, such as a spouse, in order to compensate for their comparative lack of social skills.&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt;{{rp|55}}

==In animals==
{{see also|Ethology|Altruism in animals|Sociobiology}}
[[File:CUTE FRIENDSHIP.JPG|thumb|A man with a squirrel]]
Friendship is also found among animals of higher intelligence, such as higher [[mammal]]s and some [[bird]]s. Cross-species friendships are common between humans and [[domestic animal]]s. Cross-species friendships may also occur between two non-human animals, such as [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s. Research by McLennan measured the heart rates of [[cattle]], and showed that the cows were more stressed when alone or with an unfamiliar cow than they were with friends, lending support to the idea that cows are social animals, capable of forming close bonds with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heifer so lonely: How cows have best friends and get stressed when they are separated|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2011124/Cows-best-friends-stressed-separated.html|accessdate=19 March 2012|newspaper=Mail Online|date=5 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel''''' is a sociological book written by James Ron, Harold E. Stassen Chair in International Affairs at the [[University of Minnesota]]. Inspired by his time as a member of the [[Israel Defense Forces]], as a research consultant for [[Human Rights Watch]], and as a research consultant for the [[International Red Cross]], Ron asks: "what explains why states use different kinds of violence in some cases and not others?" For Ron, institutional distinctions and international norms are key to explaining diverse repertoires of state violence against similar victims.

== Summary ==

In ''Frontiers and Ghettos'', James Ron argues that states use different methods and degrees of coercion against perceived national enemies as a result of variation in institutional contexts. 
When a targeted group is ghettoized, they are likely to become victims of severe, police-style repression but not [[ethnic cleansing]] or [[murder]]. Contrarily, when a targeted group exists on a frontier, they are more likely to become victims of cleansing and death instead of repression. This is because in ghettos, states have unrivaled control but are also bound by international and domestic legal and moral obligations to its inhabitants. Along frontiers, states have less control as well as fewer and weaker moral obligations. According to Ron, the more that a state controls a given territory, the more it feels a “bureaucratic, moral, and political sense of responsibility” for the fate of those within it.&lt;ref&gt;Ron, J. (2003). Frontiers &amp; Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of responsibility leads states to choose less overtly violent modes of repression in ghettos as compared to when states target populations exist on the periphery.

== Case Studies ==

James Ron examines five cases of ethnic violence and ethnic policing in two States, [[Serbia]] and [[Israel]], over similar periods of time. The cases are as follows:

# [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[ethnic cleansing]] on the [[Bosnia]]n frontier from 1992-1993.
# [[Serbs|Serbian]] ethnic policing against non-serbs in the [[Sandzak]] and [[Vojvodina]] from 1992-1993.
# [[Serbs|Serbian]] switch from ethnic policing in [[Kosovo]] from 1990-1997 to [[ethnic cleansing]] in 1998-1999.
# [[Israel]]i repression of [[Palestinians]] during The [[First Intifada]] in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] in 1988.
# [[Israel]]i destruction of [[PLO]] forces and Palestinian refugees during the [[1982 Lebanon War]].

Ron uses field interviews, newspaper reports and academic publications to illustrate the importance of institutional context for explaining repertoires of state violence. He argues that [[Serbia]] engaged in [[ethnic cleansing]] in [[Bosnia]] because in 1992, Bosnia became a frontier. On the other hand, [[Israel]] policed [[Palestinians]] in 1988 because [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] at the time was a ghetto, even though the threat posed by Palestinians during the 1988 uprising was greater. The more states controlled territories and peoples, the less likely their security forces were to ethnically cleanse perceived national enemies.

== Reception ==

''Frontiers and Ghettos'' was favorably received by many [[sociologists]] and [[political scientists]] as well as human rights organizations working on issues related to [[state violence]]. For example, the historian [[L. Carl Brown]], writing for ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' magazine, wrote that the book offered "a well-documented study of Ron's chosen examples and a sophisticated framework for understanding other such situations."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L. Carl. (2003). Review of ''Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel'' in ''Foreign Affairs''.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Anthony Obserschall compliments Ron for his "engaging and promising" [[hypothesis]] as well as his "fascinating" use of detail that make the footnotes as pleasurable to read as the main  text."&lt;ref&gt;''Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel'' by James Ron. Review by: Anthony Oberschall. ''Social Forces'', Vol. 82, No. 4 (Jun., 2004), pp. 1657-1659&lt;/ref&gt; However, Obserschall also critiques Ron on several grounds. For example, he argues that (1) the ethnic policing versus cleansing distinction is too crude for legal and normative evaluations of state violence, and (2) the frontier concept is applied inconsistently for the comparisons Ron wishes to make. In the former critique, Obserschall notes how 750 Palestinians were killed during The [[First Intifada]], 13,000 were wounded, hundreds lost their homes, and thousands were arrested and detained. In the latter critique, Obserschall writes that the Lebanese frontier and Bosnian frontier are not as comparable as Ron makes them out to be. [[Bosniaks]] in Bosnia were unarmed and defenseless whereas Palestinian paramilitaries in South Lebanon were heavily armed and frequently engaged in cross-border military actions against Israelis. Political Scientist [[Darius Rejali]] writes that Ron argues "persuasively" why it is important to study not just why violence is done, but how. He adds, "[Ron's] "study of the practice shows that international norms are far more robust than political scientists normally imagine".&lt;ref&gt;''Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel'' by James Ron. Review by: Darius Rejali. ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', Vol. 34, No. 1 (Autumn 2004), pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United States trademark law]], the '''functionality doctrine''' prevents [[manufacturer]]s from protecting specific features of a product by means of [[trademark]] law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/functionality_doctrine_trademark Functionality doctrine] at [[Wex]], from the [[Legal Information Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two branches of the functionality doctrine: utilitarian functionality and aesthetic functionality. The rationale behind functionality doctrine is that product markets would not be truly competitive if newcomers could not make a product with a feature that consumers demand. Utilitarian functionality provides grounds to deny federal trademark protection to product features which do something useful.  Patent law, not trademark, protects useful processes, [[machine]]s, and material [[invention]]s.  Patented designs are presumed to be functional until proven otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;''[[TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc.]]'', 532 U.S. 23 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  Aesthetic functionality  provides grounds to deny trademark protection to design features which are included to make the product more aesthetically appealing and commercially desirable.  Aesthetic features are within the purview of [[copyright]] law, which provides protection to creative and original works of authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|102}}(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utilitarian Functionality==

Courts will look to the following factors when determining utilitarian functionality:
* Whether a feature is essential to the use or purpose of the product; or
* Whether a feature affects the cost or quality of the product; or
* Whether granting of trademark for the exclusive use of the feature would put competitors at a significant non-reputation related disadvantage&lt;ref&gt;''[[Qualitex v. Jacobson Products]]'', 514 U.S. 159 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014 the federal circuit courts are split on their utilitarian functionality analysis. Most circuits, such as the Fifth Circuit&lt;ref&gt;''[[German Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz GMBH v. Ritter GMBH]]'', 289 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sixth Circuit&lt;ref&gt;''[[Antioch Co. v. Western Trimming Corp.]]'', 347 F.3d 150 (6th Cir. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; follow the Supreme Court's analysis in ''[[TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;532 U.S. 23 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on whether the feature is essential to the use or purpose of the product. The Federal Circuit in contrast focuses its analysis on whether permitting a product feature to be trademarked would impair competitors.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Valu Engineering v. Rexnord Corp]]'', 278 F.3d 1268 (Fed. Cir. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic Functionality==
In the United States, the “functionality” doctrine exists to stop a party from obtaining exclusive trade dress or trademark rights in the functional features of a product or its packaging. The doctrine developed as a way to preserve the division between what trademark law protects and areas that are better protected by patent or copyright law. Thus, the functionality doctrine serves to prevent trademark owners from inhibiting legitimate competition &lt;ref&gt;http://www.inta.org/INTABulletin/Pages/AestheticFunctionalityAfterLouboutin.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

When the aesthetic development of the good is intended to enhance the design and make the product more commercially desirable, trademark protection may be denied because the consumer is drawn to the design. The distinctiveness of the mark serves to identify the product rather than the source, and trademark protection becomes inappropriate. The underlying theory as aesthetics become integrated with functionality, the resulting product strongly resembles product design, which may receive no trademark protection absent secondary meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Louboutin S.A. v. Yves Saint Laurent America, Inc., 778 F. Supp. 2d 445, 447–48 (S.D.N.Y. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

This defense is generally seen in the fashion industry. Clothing brands can only be protected if they've acquired secondary meaning, and most of clothing design is held to be functional and is afforded no protection.&lt;ref&gt;https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/529/205/&lt;/ref&gt;

Happiness is used in the context of [[Mental health|mental]] or [[emotion]]al states, including positive or [[Pleasure|pleasant]] emotions ranging from [[contentment]] to intense [[joy]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=happiness&amp;a=*C.happiness-_*Word- |title=happiness |publisher=Wolfram Alpha |access-date=2011-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718075432/http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=happiness&amp;a=*C.happiness-_*Word- |archive-date=2011-07-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in the context of [[life satisfaction]], [[subjective well-being]], [[eudaimonia]], flourishing and [[well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anand|first1=P|title=Happiness Explained|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See definition section below.&lt;/ref&gt;

* current experience, including (a) the [[affect (psychology)|feeling of an emotion (affect)]] such as [[pleasure]] or [[joy]],&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; or (b) a more general sense of 'emotional condition as a whole'.&lt;ref&gt; Dan Haybron (https://www.slu.edu/colleges/AS/philos/site/people/faculty/Haybron/, http://www.happinessandwellbeing.org/project-team/); "''I would suggest that when we talk about happiness, we are actually referring, much of the time, to a complex emotional phenomenon. Call it emotional well-being. Happiness as emotional well-being concerns your emotions and moods, more broadly your emotional condition as a whole. To be happy is to inhabit a favorable emotional state.... On this view, we can think of happiness, loosely, as the opposite of anxiety and depression. Being in good spirits, quick to laugh and slow to anger, at peace and untroubled, confident and comfortable in your own skin, engaged, energetic and full of life.''" https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/happiness-and-its-discontents/ Haybron has also used the term thymic, by which he means 'overall mood state' in this context; https://philpapers.org/rec/HAYHAE &lt;/ref&gt; For instance [[Daniel Kahneman]] has defined happiness as "''what I experience here and now''".&lt;ref&gt;"''People don’t want to be happy the way I’ve defined the term – what I experience here and now. In my view, it’s much more important for them to be satisfied, to experience life satisfaction, from the perspective of ‘What I remember,’ of the story they tell about their lives.''"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-why-nobel-prize-winner-daniel-kahneman-gave-up-on-happiness-1.6528513&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is prevalent in dictionary definitions of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/happy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/happiness&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/happy&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophically, its scope is more often wider, encompassing a whole life. And in philosophy it is possible to speak of the happiness of a person’s life, or of their happy life, even if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable. The point is that some good things in their life made it a happy one, even though they lacked contentment. But this usage is uncommon, and may cause confusion.' https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/ 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[subjective well-being]],&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. 'Can Happiness be Measured', [[Action for Happiness]], http://www.actionforhappiness.org/why-happiness&lt;/ref&gt; which includes measures of [[affect (psychology)|affect]] and of [[life satisfaction]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Subjective_well-being#Components_of_SWB]]&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance [[Sonja Lyubomirsky]] has described happiness as “''the experience of joy, contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one's life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile.''”&lt;ref&gt;The How of Happiness, Lyubomirsky, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

These uses can give different results.&lt;ref&gt;"I am happy when I'm unhappy." Mark Baum character, [[The Big Short (film)]], https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film)#Mark_Baum&lt;/ref&gt; For instance the correlation of income levels has been shown to be substantial with [[life satisfaction]] measures, but to be far weaker, at least above a certain threshold, with [[affect (psychology)|affect]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;"''Surveying large numbers of Americans in one case, and what is claimed to be the first globally representative sample of humanity in the other, these studies found that income does indeed correlate substantially (.44 in the global sample), at all levels, with life satisfaction—strictly speaking, a “life evaluation” measure that asks respondents to rate their lives without saying whether they are satisfied. Yet the correlation of household income with the affect measures is far weaker: globally, .17 for positive affect, –.09 for negative affect; and in the United States, essentially zero above $75,000 (though quite strong at low income levels). If the results hold up, the upshot appears to be that income is pretty strongly related to life satisfaction, but weakly related to emotional well-being, at least above a certain threshold.''" Section 3.3, Happiness, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/happiness/#HedVerEmoSta&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being", Daniel Kahneman and [[Angus Deaton]], Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 21/9/10&lt;/ref&gt;

The implied meaning of the word may vary depending on context,&lt;ref&gt;"''How does happiness come into this classification? For better or worse, it enters in three ways. It is sometimes used as a current emotional report- “How happy are you now?,” sometimes as a remembered emotion, as in “How happy were you yesterday?,” and very often as a form of life evaluation, as in “How happy are you with your life as a whole these days?” People answer these three types of happiness question differently, so it is important to keep track of what is being asked. The good news is that the answers differ in ways that suggest that people understand what they are being asked, and answer appropriately.''" [[John Helliwell]] and Shun Yang, p11, [[World Happiness Report]] 2012 http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2012/&lt;/ref&gt; qualifying happiness as a [[Polysemy|polyseme]] and a [[fuzzy concept]]. 

Some users accept these issues, but continue to use the word because of its convening power.&lt;ref&gt;"''Some have argued that it is misleading to use ‘happiness’ as a generic term to cover subjective well-being more generally. While ‘subjective well-being’ is more precise, it simply does not have the convening power of ‘happiness’. The main linguistic argument for using happiness in a broader generic role is that happiness plays two important roles within the science of well-being, appearing once as a prototypical positive emotion and again as part of a cognitive life evaluation question. This double use has sometimes been used to argue that there is no coherent structure to happiness responses. The converse argument made in the World Happiness Reports is that this double usage helps to justify using happiness in a generic role, as long as the alternative meanings are clearly understood and credibly related. Evidence from a growing number of large scale surveys shows that the answers to questions asking about the emotion of happiness differ from answers to judgmental questions asking about a person’s happiness with life as a whole in exactly the ways that theory would suggest. Answers to questions about the emotion of happiness relate well to what is happening at the moment. Evaluative answers, in response to questions about life as a whole, are supported by positive emotions, as noted above, but also driven much more, than are answers to questions about emotions, by a variety of life circumstances, including income, health and social trust.''" [[John F. Helliwell]] and others, World Happiness Report, 2015, quoted in What’s Special About Happiness as a Social Indicator? John F. Helliwell, Published online: 25 February 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Philosophy of happiness}}

In the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', written in 350 BCE, [[Aristotle]] stated that happiness (also being well and doing well) is the only thing that humans desire for its own sake, unlike riches, honour, health or friendship. He observed that men sought riches, or honour, or health not only for their own sake but also in order to be happy. Note that ''[[eudaimonia]]'', the term we translate as "happiness", is for Aristotle an activity rather than an emotion or a state.&lt;ref&gt;Eudaimonia (Greek: εὐδαιμονία) is a classical Greek word commonly translated as 'happiness' or, better yet, 'flourishing'. Etymologically, it consists of the word "eu" ("good" or "well being") and "daimōn" ("spirit" or "minor deity", used by extension to mean one's lot or fortune).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus understood, the happy life is the good life, that is, a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way. Specifically, Aristotle argues that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity.  He arrives at this claim with the Function Argument.  Basically, if it's right, every living thing has a function, that which it uniquely does. For humans, Aristotle contends, our function is to reason, since it is that alone that we uniquely do. And performing one's function well, or excellently, is good. Thus, according to Aristotle, the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life. Aristotle does not leave it at that, however. He argues that there is a second best life for those incapable of excellent rational activity. This second best life is the life of moral virtue.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Many [[ethics|ethicists]] make arguments for how humans should behave, either individually or collectively, based on the resulting happiness of such behavior. [[Utilitarian]]s, such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]], advocated the [[greatest happiness principle]] as a guide for ethical behavior.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] savagely critiqued the English Utilitarians' focus on attaining the greatest happiness, stating that "Man does not strive for happiness, only the Englishman does." Nietzsche meant that making happiness one's ultimate ''goal'' and the aim of one's existence, in his words "makes one contemptible." Nietzsche instead yearned for a culture that would set higher, more difficult goals than "mere happiness." He introduced the quasi-dystopic figure of the "last man" as a kind of [[thought experiment]] against the utilitarians and happiness-seekers. these small, "last men" who seek after only their own pleasure and health, avoiding all danger, exertion, difficulty, challenge, struggle are meant to seem contemptible to Nietzsche's reader. Nietzsche instead wants us to consider the value of what is difficult, what can only be earned through struggle, difficulty, pain and thus to come to see the affirmative value suffering and ''unhappiness'' truly play in creating everything of great worth in life, including all the highest achievements of human culture, not least of all philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/|title=Nietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy|work=stanford.edu|access-date=2015-08-10|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66D67rj9I?url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/|archive-date=2012-03-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900)|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nietzsch/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=2015-08-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815204318/http://www.iep.utm.edu/nietzsch/|archive-date=2015-08-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Darrin McMahon]] claims that there has been a transition over time from emphasis on the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McMahon |first1=Darrin M. |title=From the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness: 400 B.C. – A.D. 1780 |journal=Daedalus |volume=133 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=5–17 |jstor=20027908 |doi=10.1162/001152604323049343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
In [[Advaita Vedanta]], the ultimate goal of life is happiness, in the sense that duality between [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]] is transcended and one realizes oneself to be the Self in all.

[[Patanjali]], author of the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sutras]], wrote quite exhaustively on the psychological and ontological roots of bliss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levine | first = Marvin

====Confucianism====
The Chinese Confucian thinker [[Mencius]], who had sought to give advice to ruthless political leaders during China's Warring States period, was convinced that the mind played a mediating role between the "lesser self" (the physiological self) and the "greater self" (the moral self), and that getting the priorities right between these two would lead to sage-hood. He argued that if one did not feel satisfaction or pleasure in nourishing one's "vital force" with "righteous deeds", then that force would shrivel up (Mencius, 6A:15 2A:2). More specifically, he mentions the experience of intoxicating joy if one celebrates the practice of the great virtues, especially through music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chan | first = Wing-tsit

When a person is happy they are much more capable of serving God and going about their daily activities than when depressed or upset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breslov.org/dvar/zmanim/elul3_5758.htm ''Breslov.org''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112020019/http://www.breslov.org/dvar/zmanim/elul3_5758.htm |date=November 12, 2014 }} Accessed November 11, 2014.{{self-published inline|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Roman Catholicism ====
The primary meaning of "happiness" in various European languages involves good fortune, chance or happening. The meaning in Greek philosophy, however, refers primarily to ethics.

In [[Catholicism]], the ultimate end of human existence consists in felicity, Latin equivalent to the Greek ''[[eudaimonia]]'', or "blessed happiness", described by the 13th-century philosopher-theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] as a [[Beatific Vision]] of God's essence in the next life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Question 3. What is happiness |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/200308.htm |journal=[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]] |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Aquinas |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011133516/http://newadvent.org/summa/200308.htm |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[St. Augustine]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]], man's last end is happiness: "all men agree in desiring the last end, which is happiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2001.htm#article4 |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: Man's last end (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 1) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105095827/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2001.htm#article4 |archive-date=2011-11-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, where utilitarians focused on reasoning about consequences as the primary tool for reaching happiness, Aquinas agreed with Aristotle that happiness cannot be reached solely through reasoning about consequences of acts, but also requires a pursuit of good causes for acts, such as habits according to [[virtue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3.htm |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: Secunda Secundae Partis |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518035222/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3.htm |archive-date=2013-05-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, which habits and acts that normally lead to happiness is according to Aquinas caused by laws: [[natural law]] and [[divine law]]. These laws, in turn, were according to Aquinas caused by a first cause, or God.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

According to Aquinas, happiness consists in an "operation of the speculative intellect": "Consequently happiness consists principally in such an operation, viz. in the contemplation of Divine things." And, "the last end cannot consist in the active life, which pertains to the practical intellect." So: "Therefore the last and perfect happiness, which we await in the life to come, consists entirely in contemplation. But imperfect happiness, such as can be had here, consists first and principally in contemplation, but secondarily, in an operation of the practical intellect directing human actions and passions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#article2 |title=Summa Theologica: What is happiness (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 3) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109063700/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#article2 |archive-date=2012-01-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human complexities, like reason and cognition, can produce well-being or happiness, but such form is limited and transitory. In temporal life, the contemplation of God, the infinitely Beautiful, is the supreme delight of the will. ''Beatitudo'', or perfect happiness, as complete well-being, is to be attained not in this life, but the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Happiness|work=newadvent.org|access-date=2012-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501191841/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07131b.htm|archive-date=2012-05-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
[[Al-Ghazali]] (1058–1111), the Muslim Sufi thinker, wrote "[[The Alchemy of Happiness]]", a manual of spiritual instruction throughout the Muslim world and widely practiced today.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Psychology ==
Happiness in its broad sense is the label for a family of pleasant emotional states, such as [[joy]], [[amusement]], [[Contentment|satisfaction]], [[gratification]], [[euphoria]], and [[Pride#As an emotion|triumph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Algoe |first1=Sara B. |last2=Haidt |first2=Jonathan |title=Witnessing excellence in action: the 'other-praising' emotions of elevation, gratitude, and admiration |journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=105–27 |year=2009 |pmid=19495425 |pmc=2689844 |doi=10.1080/17439760802650519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Happiness can be examined in experiential and evaluative contexts. Experiential well-being, or "objective happiness", is happiness measured in the moment via questions such as "How good or bad is your experience now?". In contrast, evaluative well-being asks questions such as "How good was your vacation?" and measures one's subjective thoughts and feelings about happiness in the past. Experiential well-being is less prone to errors in [[reconstructive memory]], but the majority of literature on happiness refers to evaluative well-being. The two measures of happiness can be related by heuristics such as the [[peak-end rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Huppert|editor-first1=Felicia A|editor-last2=Baylis|editor-first2=Nick|editor-last3=Keverne|editor-first3=Barry|last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|author1-link=Daniel Kahneman|first2=Jason|last2=Riis|title=The science of well-being|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford ; New York|isbn=9780198567523|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198567523.003.0011|chapter-url=https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/Publications/Living_DK_JR_2005.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2017|language=en|chapter=Living, and thinking about it: two perspectives on life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deci |first1=Edward L. |last2=Ryan |first2=Richard M. |title=Hedonia, eudaimonia, and well-being: an introduction |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9018-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories===

====Maslow's hierarchy of needs====
[[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] is a pyramid depicting the levels of human needs, psychological, and physical. When a human being ascends the steps of the pyramid, he reaches [[self-actualization]]. Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as [[peak experiences]], profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. This is similar to the [[Flow (psychology)|flow]] concept of [[Mihály Csíkszentmihályi]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Amitai Etzioni points out that Maslow's definition of human needs, even on the highest level, that of self-actualization, is self-centered (i.e. his view of satisfaction or what makes a person happy, does not include service to others or the common good—unless it enriches the self). As implied by its name, self-actualization is highly individualistic and reflects Maslow's premise that the self is “sovereign and inviolable” and entitled to “his or her own tastes, opinions, values, etc.”&lt;ref&gt;Adrianne Aron, “Maslow’s Other Child,” Journal of Humanistic Psychology 17(2), 1977, 13; Amitai Etzioni, Happiness is the Wrong Metric: A Liberal Communitarian Response to Populism, Springer, January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-determination theory====
[[File:Girl of Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Smiling woman from [[Vietnam]]]]
[[Self-determination theory]] relates [[intrinsic motivation]] to three needs: [[Competence (human resources)|competence]], [[autonomy]], and [[Social relation|relatedness]].

====Modernization and freedom of choice====
[[Ronald Inglehart]] has traced cross-national differences in the level of happiness based on data from the [[World Values Survey]]. He finds that the extent to which a society allows free choice has a major impact on happiness. When [[basic needs]] are satisfied, the degree of happiness depends on economic and cultural factors that enable free choice in how people live their lives. Happiness also depends on religion in countries where free choice is constrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Inglehart |first1=Ronald F. |title=Cultural Evolution: People's Motivations Are Changing, and Reshaping the World |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/9781108613880 |isbn=9781108613880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Positive psychology====
Since 2000 the field of [[positive psychology]] has expanded drastically in terms of scientific publications, and has produced many different views on causes of happiness, and on factors that correlate with happiness.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallis |first=Claudia |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1015902-1,00.html |title=Science of Happiness: New Research on Mood, Satisfaction |publisher=TIME |date=2005-01-09 |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115020515/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1015902-1%2C00.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous short-term self-help interventions have been developed and demonstrated to improve happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolier|first1=Linda|last2=Haverman|first2=Merel|last3=Westerhof|first3=Gerben J|last4=Riper|first4=Heleen|last5=Smit|first5=Filip|last6=Bohlmeijer|first6=Ernst|title=Positive psychology interventions: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies|journal=BMC Public Health|date=8 February 2013|volume=13|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.psysci.co/40-scientifically-proven-ways-happier/ |title=40 Scientifically Proven Ways To Be Happier |access-date=2018-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311190556/http://www.psysci.co/40-scientifically-proven-ways-happier/ |archive-date=2016-03-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement of happiness ==
Several scales have been developed to measure happiness:
* The [[Subjective Happiness Scale]] (SHS) is a four-item scale, measuring global subjective happiness.  The scale requires participants to use absolute ratings to characterize themselves as happy or unhappy individuals, as well as it asks to what extent they identify themselves with descriptions of happy and unhappy individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/subjectivehappinessscale.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522230648/http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/subjectivehappinessscale.pdf |archivedate=May 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyubomirsky |first1=Sonja |last2=Lepper |first2=Heidi S. |date=February 1999 |title=A Measure of Subjective Happiness: Preliminary Reliability and Construct Validation |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=137–55 |jstor=27522363 |doi=10.1023/A:1006824100041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Affect measures#PANAS|Positive and Negative Affect Schedule]] (PANAS) is used to detect the relation between personality traits and positive or negative affects at this moment, today, the past few days, the past week, the past few weeks, the past year, and generally (on average).

{{Main|Happiness economics}}

In politics, ''happiness'' as a guiding ideal is expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776, written by [[Thomas Jefferson]], as the universal right to "the pursuit of happiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schlesinger |first1=Arthur M. |title=The Lost Meaning of "The Pursuit of Happiness" |journal=The William and Mary Quarterly |volume=21 |issue=3 |year=1964 |pages=325–27 |jstor=1918449 |doi=10.2307/1918449 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to suggest a subjective interpretation but one that nonetheless goes beyond emotions alone.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In fact, this discussion is often based on the naive assumption that the word ''happiness'' meant the same thing in 1776 as it does today. In fact, ''happiness'' meant "prosperity, thriving, wellbeing" in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fountain|first1=Ben|title=Two American Dreams: how a dumbed-down nation lost sight of a great idea|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/american-dream-divided-nation-equal-opportunity-trump-clinton-campaign|accessdate=2017-01-19|work=The Guardian|date=17 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123161503/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/american-dream-divided-nation-equal-opportunity-trump-clinton-campaign|archive-date=2016-11-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common market health measures such as [[GDP]] and [[GNP]] have been used as a measure of successful policy. On average richer nations tend to be happier than poorer nations, but this effect seems to diminish with wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Bruno S. | last = Frey |author2=Alois Stutzer | title =  Happiness and Economics | publisher = Princeton University Press |date=December 2001 | isbn = 0-691-06998-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8179 | title = In Pursuit of Happiness Research.

Work by Paul Anand and colleagues helps to highlight the fact that there many different contributors to adult wellbeing, that happiness judgement reflect, in part, the presence of salient constraints, and that fairness, autonomy, community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and wellbeing throughout the life course.

[[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] [[think tank]] [[Cato Institute]] claims that [[economic freedom]] correlates strongly with happiness&lt;ref name="cato.org"&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8179 In Pursuit of Happiness Research.

According to certain standards, East European countries (ruled by Communist parties) were less happy than Western ones, even less happy than other equally poor countries.&lt;ref name=sci&gt;[http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/spring05/polspr05-2.htm The Scientist's Pursuit of Happiness] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223054616/http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/spring05/polspr05-2.htm |date=February 23, 2010 }}, ''Policy'', Spring 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, much empirical research in the field of [[happiness economics]], such as that by [[Benjamin Radcliff]], professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame, supports the contention that (at least in democratic countries) life satisfaction is strongly and positively related to the social democratic model of a generous social safety net, pro-worker labor market regulations, and strong labor unions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Radcliff|Radcliff, Benjamin]] (2013) ''The Political Economy of Human Happiness'' (New York: Cambridge University Press).{{page needed|date=August 2016}} See also '''this collection of full-text peer reviewed scholarly articles on this subject''' by Radcliff and colleagues (from "Social Forces," "The Journal of Politics," and "Perspectives on Politics," among others) [http://benjaminradcliff.com/scholarly-articles/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712200741/http://benjaminradcliff.com/scholarly-articles/ |date=2015-07-12 }}{{synthesis inline|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there is evidence that public policies that reduce poverty and support a strong middle class, such as a higher minimum wage, strongly affects average levels of well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/05/14/does-a-higher-minimum-wage-make-people-happier/|title=Does a higher minimum wage make people happier?|author=Michael Krassa|date=14 May 2014|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707112256/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/05/14/does-a-higher-minimum-wage-make-people-happier/|archive-date=2015-07-07|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that happiness measures could be used not as a replacement for more traditional measures, but as a supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-weiner13nov13,0,5698259.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail |title=Four months of boom, bust, and fleeing foreign credit |first=Eric J. |last=Weiner |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2007-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222025241/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-weiner13nov13%2C0%2C5698259.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail |archivedate=December 22, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to professor Edward Glaeser, people constantly make choices that decrease their happiness, because they have also more important aims. Therefore, the government should not decrease the alternatives available for the citizen by patronizing them but let the citizen keep a maximal freedom of choice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/05/11/edward-glaeser/coercive-regulation-and-the-balance-of-freedom/ Coercive regulation and the balance of freedom] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715000839/http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/05/11/edward-glaeser/coercive-regulation-and-the-balance-of-freedom/ |date=2009-07-15 }}, Edward Glaeser, Cato Unbound 11.5.2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Good [[mental health]] and good relationships contribute more than income to happiness and governments should take these into account.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38285223 Mental health and relationships 'key to happiness'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316084200/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38285223 |date=2018-03-16 }} ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

His father served as Dean of Arts and Sciences, vice president and was appointed interim president of the University of Vermont during World War I. He was also the state geologist of Vermont from 1898 to 1933. He graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from [[Yale University]], class of 1867; received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from Yale in 1869.

His mother was Mary Judd Farnham,&lt;ref name=Cutter747&gt;Cutter, p. 747&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones621&gt;Jones, p. 621&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones622&gt;Jones, p. 622&lt;/ref&gt; an 1863 graduate of [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]], and a daughter of Eli Farnham&lt;ref name="Loomis-Farnham1" /&gt; and [[Loomis Homestead|Jerusha Brewster Loomis]].&lt;ref name=Loomis117&gt;Loomis, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858|debates]] between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] at Knox College on October 7, 1858.&lt;ref name=Jones274&gt;Jones, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; It was said of her that she was a woman of superior mental endowments. She was the president of the Vermont Chapter of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], and was active in her church and philanthropic work. Her first cousin was Dr. [[George Trumbull Ladd]] an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]], [[educator]] and [[psychologist]].

Mary's parents had emigrated to [[Illinois]] in 1836 and were the among the founders and pioneers of [[Galesburg, Illinois]]. They built a temporary cabin in Log City near current Lake Storey, just north of Galesburg, the settlers having decided that no log cabins were to be built inside the town limits. They were also instrumental in the founding of [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]]. Eli Farnham served as secretary of the Board of Trustees for nearly forty years and also the first school teacher in Galesburg.&lt;ref name=Jones621&gt;Jones, p. 621&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones622&gt;Jones, p. 622&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loomis-Farnham1"&gt;{{cite web

===Education===
He graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from the University of Vermont, Burlington in 1898, received his [[Master of Science|M.Sc]] in 1899 and was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Zoology]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1902. The title of his [[Thesis or dissertation|doctoral thesis]] was ''The Development of Gonionema Murbachii'', which was on the development and life cycle of [[Jellyfish|Gonionema murbachii]] (a type of jellyfish).&lt;ref name="NaturalSciences750-790"&gt;NaturalSciences, pp. 750–790&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving his doctorate, he joined the faculty of UVM where he remained until his retirement.

===Marriage and family===
He married on June 11, 1903 at [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], Mary Edmunds, born at Baltimore, Maryland on October 18, 1874 the daughter of James Richard Edmunds and Anna Smith Keyser. She was the sister of Dr. Charles Keyser Edmunds, one of his fellow graduate students at Johns Hopkins. He was president of [[Lingnan University (Guangzhou)|Canton Christian College]] in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Guangdong|Kwangtung Province]], [[China]] and the fifth president of [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California]].&lt;ref name=Howe292&gt;Howe, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Howe312&gt;Howe, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Another brother was [[James R. Edmunds, Jr.|James Richard Edmunds, Jr.]], a graduate of the [[University of Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/04/28/100362494.pdf "WIN ARCHITECTURAL PRIZES.; University of Pennsylvania Carries Off Twelve of Nineteen Awards."] ''New York Times.'' April 28, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; and a notable [[Architect]] in Baltimore, Maryland.

She was a descendant of [[John Howland]], (c. 1599–1673) who was one of the Pilgrims who travelled from England to North America on the Mayflower, signed the [[Mayflower Compact]], and helped found Plymouth Colony.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Edmunds, James Richard Edmunds, Thomas Hughes Edmunds, Lidia Hughes, Thomas Hurst Hughes, Ellis Hughes, Hannah Whilldin, Joseph Whilldin, Hannah Gorham, Desire Howland, John Howland&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the great great granddaughter of [[Thomas Hurst Hughes]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=hughes&amp;GSfn=thomas&amp;GSbyrel=in&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSst=33&amp;GScnty=1911&amp;GScntry=4&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=6939782&amp; Thomas Hurst Hughes] at [[Find A Grave]]&lt;/ref&gt; the founder and owner of the [[Congress Hall (Cape May hotel)|Congress Hall Hotel]] in [[Cape May, New Jersey]], and a Republican member of the [[United States congressional delegations from New Jersey|United States House of Representatives]] from [[New Jersey]].

Henry and Mary were the parents of two children, Anna Keyser Perkins-Middlebrook,&lt;ref name=Howe312&gt;Howe, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; who married as her second husband, Stanwood Wollaston&lt;ref name=Cutter747&gt;Cutter, p. 747&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Career===
In 1903, he was appointed associate professor of Zoology at University of Vermont, Burlington. He taught biology, entomology, anatomy and physiology, and embryology during the first half of his career. In 1911 was promoted to full professor and served as chairman of the Zoology Department. His sporadic research projects involved field studies in the rapidly fading naturalist tradition: studies of birds, game fish, and marine invertebrates. He retired in 1945 and remained active in the UVM Alumni Association until his death in 1956.

His interest in eugenics began shortly after the end of World War I. It was after World War I that he learned of a study by the U.S. Army which was used as part of the draft process. The results from the Army study showed that men from Vermont had an inordinately high rate of "defects" (such as diabetes, epilepsy, "deformities" and "mental deficiency"). Perkins saw this as a problem that needed to be fixed. He went about trying to "fix" this through investigation and social reform.&lt;ref name=Gallagher38-39&gt;Gallagher, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; This reform, as denounced by historian Nancy Gallagher in her research titled ''Breeding better Vermonters'', also targeted French Canadians and American natives in Vermont state, considered ''insane invasion'' to eliminate.

Around the same time, he revamped his Zoology curriculum and began teaching courses specifically on Heredity and Evolution. His heredity class provided the first known venue for eugenics education at UVM and the inspiration for a "Eugenics Survey"—a field station to study Vermonters.

===Death===
He died on November 24, 1956 in Burlington, Vermont. He is buried in Greenmount Cemetery, Burlington, Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23351472 Henry Farnham Perkins] at [[Find A Grave]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homoplasy''', in [[biology]] and [[phylogenetics]], is when a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] has been gained or lost independently in separate lineages over the course of evolution. This is different from [[Homology (biology)|homology]], which is the similarity of traits due to common ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Torres-Montúfar A, Borsch T, Ochoterena H | title = When Homoplasy Is Not Homoplasy: Dissecting Trait Evolution by Contrasting Composite and Reductive Coding | journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 543–551 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 28645204 | doi = 10.1093/sysbio/syx053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homoplasy can arise from both similar [[Natural selection|selection]] pressures acting on adapting species, and the effects of [[genetic drift]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolution: an introduction| vauthors = Stearns SC, Hoekstra RF |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=9780199255634 |edition=2nd|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall AR, Colegrave N | title = Decay of unused characters by selection and drift | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 610–7 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18081745 | doi = 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01473.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[File:Homoplasy.jpg|thumb|Homoplasy is the similarity in trait that is not due to a common ancestor.]]

Most often, homoplasy is viewed as a similarity in morphological traits. However, homoplasy may also appear in other trait types, such as similarity in the genetic sequence &lt;ref name="Reece2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson1996"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homoplasy: The Recurrence of Similarity in Evolution| vauthors =Sanderson MJ, Hufford L |publisher=Academic Press, Inc.|year=1996|isbn=0-12-618030-X|location=San Diego, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;, life cycle types &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silberfeld T, Leigh JW, Verbruggen H, Cruaud C, de Reviers B, Rousseau F | title = A multi-locus time-calibrated phylogeny of the brown algae (Heterokonta, Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae): Investigating the evolutionary nature of the "brown algal crown radiation" | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 659–74 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20412862 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.04.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or even behavioral traits &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Queiroz A, Wimberger PH | title = The usefulness of behavior for phylogeny estimation: levels of homoplasy in behavioral and morphological characters | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 46–60 | date = February 1993 | pmid = 28568085 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1993.tb01198.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson1996" /&gt;.

== Etymology ==
The term homoplasy was first used by [[Ray Lankester]] in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Lankester ER |year=1870|title=On the use of the term homology in modern zoology, and the distinction between homogenetic and homoplastic agreements.|journal=Annals and Magazine of Natural History|volume=6|pages=34-43|doi=10.1080/00222937008696201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding adjective is either ''homoplasic'' or ''homoplastic''.
It is derived from the two [[ancient greek]] words {{wikt-lang|grc|ὁμός}} ({{grc-transl|ὁμός}}), meaning "similar, alike, the same", and {{wikt-lang|grc|πλάσσω}} ({{grc-transl|πλάσσω}}), meaning "to shape, to mold".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Abrégé du dictionnaire grec français |last=Bailly |first=Anatole | name-list-format = vanc |date=1981-01-01 |publisher=Hachette |isbn=2010035283 |location=Paris |oclc=461974285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tabularium.be/bailly/ |title=Greek-french dictionary online |last=Bailly |first=Anatole | name-list-format = vanc|date= |website=www.tabularium.be | |access-date=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comenius.susqu.edu/biol/202/dictionary%20of%20terms/h/homoplasy.htm|title=Systematic Biology - Dictionary of Terms: Homoplasy| vauthors = Holt JR, Judica CA |date=February 4, 2014| |access-date=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reece2011"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Campbell Biology| vauthors = Reece JB, Urry LA, Cain ML, Wasserman SA, Minorsky PV, Jackson RB  |publisher=Pearson|year=2011|isbn=9780321739759|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parallelism and convergence ==
[[Parallel evolution|Parallel]] and [[convergent evolution]] lead to homoplasy when different species independently evolve or gain a comparable trait, which diverges from the trait inferred to have been present in their common ancestor. When the similar traits are caused by an equivalent developmental mechanism, the process is referred to as parallel evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Archie JW |year=1989|title=Homoplasy excess ratios: new indices for measuring levels of homoplasy in phylogenetic systematics and a critique of the consistency index|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=38|pages=253-269|doi=10.2307/2992286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Wake DB |date= September 1991 |title=Homoplasy: The Result of Natural Selection, or Evidence of Design Limitations? |journal=The American Naturalist|language=en|volume=138|issue=3|pages=543–567|doi=10.1086/285234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is called convergent evolution when the similarity arises from different developmental mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Hodin J |year=2000|title=Plasticity and constraints in development and evolution|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|volume=288|pages=1-20|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-010X(20000415)288:1&lt;1::AID-JEZ1&gt;3.0.CO;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of homoplasy may occur when different lineages live in comparable ecological niches that require similar adaptations for an increase in fitness. An interesting example is that of the marsupial moles ([[Notoryctidae]]), golden moles ([[Chrysochloridae]]) and northern moles ([[Talpidae]]). These are mammals from different geographical regions and lineages, and have all independently evolved very similar burrowing characteristics (such as a cone-shaped heads and flat frontal claws) to live in a subterranean ecological niche &lt;ref name="Nevo1979"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Nevo E |year=1979|title=Adaptive convergence and divergence of subterranean mammals|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=10|pages=269-308|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.10.110179.001413}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Reversion ==
In contrast, [[Reverse evolution|reversal]] (a.k.a. vestigialization) leads to homoplasy through the disappearance of previously gained traits &lt;ref name="Wake2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wake DB, Wake MH, Specht CD | title = Homoplasy: from detecting pattern to determining process and mechanism of evolution | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6020 | pages = 1032–5 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21350170 | doi = 10.1126/science.1188545 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. This process may result from changes in the environment in which certain gained traits are no longer relevant, or have even become costly &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Fong DW, Kane TC, Culver DC |year=1995|title=Vestigialization and loss of nonfunctional characters|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=26|pages=249-68|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.26.110195.001341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall2008" /&gt;. This can be observed in subterranean and cave-dwelling animals by their loss of sight &lt;ref name="Nevo1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones R, Culver DC | title = EEvidence for selection on sensory structures in a cave population of ''Gammarus minus'' (Amphipoda) | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 688–693 | date = May 1989 | pmid = 28568387 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1989.tb04267.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;, in cave-dwelling animals through their loss of pigmentation &lt;ref name="Jones1989" /&gt;, and in both snakes and legless lizards through their loss of limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Skinner A, Lee MS |year=2009|title=Body-form evolution in the scincid lizard ''Lerista'' and the mode of macroevolutionary transitions|journal=Evolutionary Biology|volume=36|pages=292-300|doi=10.1007/s11692-009-9064-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Skinner A, Lee MS, Hutchinson MN | title = Rapid and repeated limb loss in a clade of scincid lizards | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 8 | pages = 310 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19014443 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-8-310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinguishing homology from homoplasy ==

Homoplasy, especially the type that occurs in more closely related phylogenetic groups, can make phylogenetic analysis more challenging. [[Phylogenetic tree|Phylogenetic trees]] are created by means of [[parsimony analysis]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Phylogenetics: Theory and Practice of Phylogenetic Systematics| vauthors = Wiley EO, Lieberman BS |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=2011 |isbn=9780470905968 |location=Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications| vauthors = Schuh RT, Brower AV |publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780801462436|location=Ithaca, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These analyses can be done with phenotypic, as well as genetic traits (DNA sequences) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inferring phylogenies|vauthors = Felsenstein J |publisher=Sinauer|year=2004|isbn=978-0878931774}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Using parsimony analysis, the hypothesis that requires the fewest evolutionary changes is preferred over alternative hypotheses. Construction of these trees may become a challenge when clouded by the occurrence of homoplasy in the traits used for the analysis. The most important approach in overcoming these challenges, is by increasing the amount of independent (non-[[Pleiotropy|pleiotropic]], non-[[Genetic linkage|linked]]) characteristics used in the construction of these phylogenic trees. Along with parsimony analysis, one could perform a likelihood analysis, where the probability of a tree being true is calculated and branch lengths are measured; and bootstrapping, in which trees are constructed for each characteristic separately to estimate the confidence of a tree.&lt;ref name="Sanderson1996" /&gt;

According to [[Cladogram#Measuring homoplasy|cladistic interpretation]], homoplasy can be identified when a given similarity in trait cannot be explained by relation through a common ancestor on a preferred phylogenetic hypothesis - that is, the feature in question arises (or disappears) at more than one point on the tree &lt;ref name="Wake2011" /&gt;.

In the case of DNA sequences, homoplasy cannot be avoided due to its four-state nature. An observed homoplasy may simply be the result of  [[Genetic drift|random nucleotide substitutions]] accumulating over time, and thus may not need an [[adaptationist]] evolutionary explanation &lt;ref name="Sanderson1996" /&gt;.

== Examples and applications of homoplasy ==

There are numerous documented examples of homoplasy within the following taxa:

The occurrence of homoplasy can also be used to make predictions about evolution. Recent studies have used homoplasy to predict the possibility and the path of extraterrestrial evolution. For example, Levin et al. (2017) suggest that the development of eye-like structures is highly likely, due to its numerous, independently evolved incidences on earth.&lt;ref name="Wake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Levin SR, Scott TW, Cooper HS, West SA |year=2017|title=Darwin's aliens|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|pages=1-9|doi=10.1017/S1473550417000362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homoplasy vs. evolutionary contingency ==

In his book [[Wonderful Life (book)|''Wonderful Life'']], [[Stephen Jay Gould]] claims that repeating the evolutionary process, from any point in time onward, would not produce the same results &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History| vauthors = Gould SJ |publisher=Vintage Books|year=2000|isbn=9780099273455|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The occurrence of homoplasy is viewed by some biologists as an argument against Gould’s theory of evolutionary contingency. Powell &amp; Mariscal (2015) argue that this disagreement is caused by an [[equivocation]] and that both the theory of contingency as well as homoplastic occurrence can be true at the same time &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell R, Mariscal C | title = Convergent evolution as natural experiment: the tape of life reconsidered | journal = Interface Focus | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 20150040 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26640647 | doi = 10.1098/rsfs.2015.0040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
[[File:IDI round table.jpg|thumb|250px|Round table discussion, Israel Democracy Institute]]
The Israel Democracy Institute was founded in 1991 by [[Arye Carmon]], the founding president, and Mr. [[Bernard Marcus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/business/business-opinion/.premium-1.653842 How Israel profits from the nonprofits] Haaretz, 28 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

IDI works to bolster the values and institutions of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. A non-partisan think-and-do tank,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/world/middleeast/israeli-cabinet-backs-nationality-bill-that-risks-wider-rift-with-arab-minority.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/08/world/africa/08iht-israel.4519509.html]&lt;/ref&gt; the institute harnesses rigorous applied research to influence policy, legislation and public opinion. The institute partners with government, policy and decision makers, civil service and society, to improve the functioning of the government and its institutions, confront [[security]] threats while preserving civil liberties, and foster solidarity within Israeli society. Israel recognized the positive impact of IDI's research and recommendations by conferring upon the institute its most prestigious award, the [[Israel Prize]] for Lifetime Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/PrashTashsath/MachonIshraeliLedemokratya/NsMachonIshraeliLedemokratya.htm|title=נימוקי השופטים|website=cms.education.gov.il|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Yohanan Plesner]] was appointed president of the Institute. He replaced Arik Carmon, who left to concentrate on research after a 22-year term of service.

== Structure ==
The Israel Democracy Institute contains the following centers:

=== The Center for Democratic Values and Institutions ===
Engages with the core issues of Israeli democracy, and with the erosion in public commitment to substantive democracy and its values. The Center focuses on bolstering the commitment of public institutions and decision makers to the protection of human rights, to the principles of freedom and equality, and to the rule of law. The research and implementation work carried out at the Center concentrates on failures in implementing the principle of the separation of powers, and on maintaining the independence of the state's structural institutions, including the courts, the [[Knesset]], the government, regulatory bodies, the state prosecutor and the attorney general, local government, and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/centers/1155|title=Center for Democratic Values and Institutions|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Center for Religion, Nation and State ===
Addresses the question of how to balance the particularistic Jewish characteristics of the State of Israel (nationality and religion) with its liberal-democratic characteristics. The Center is also concerned with renewing the conceptual foundations of Jewish-democratic Zionism for our times, and with the internal and external challenges to the state's Jewish identity. The Center's researchers are also engaged in developing ways for Israel's [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] population to be integrated into the general Israeli economy and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/centers/1157|title=Center for Religion, Nation and State|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Center for Governance and the Economy ===
Promotes reforms to the political system, the civil service, and the labor market in Israel, with the aim of improving the functioning of these systems and increasing public trust in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/centers/1156|title=Center for Governance and the Economy|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Center for Security and Democracy ===
Maps the challenges for democratic societies posed by the fight against terror, and examines how a balance can be maintained between answering security needs and protecting human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/centers/1158|title=Center for Security and Democracy|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guttman Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research ===
An independent research center that has operated under the auspices of the Israel Democracy Institute since 1998, engaged in collecting, analyzing, and maintaining empirical data relating to Israeli society and politics. The Center's comprehensive [[Surveying|survey]] database contains data from more than a thousand public opinion surveys conducted since 1967 on a range of political, social, and media-related topics. The Center is headed by Prof. Tamar Hermann. Among the more noteworthy publications issued by the Guttman Center in recent years are: Religious? National!, a survey of attitudes and behaviors in the national-religious sector in Israel; the annual Israeli Democracy Index; and the monthly Peace Index produced in partnership with Tel-Aviv University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/centers/1159|title=The Guttman Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

=== Eli Hurvitz Conference on Economy and Society (formerly the Caesarea Forum) ===
The Eli Hurvitz Conference on Economy and Society, run by the Israel Democracy Institute, is Israel's leading economic conference. Since 1993, the conference has served as the meeting place for public discourse and professional knowledge relating to economy and society in Israel. Its main goal is to improve decision-making processes in government, so as to ensure better social and economic policies that will benefit all Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/events/14059|title=Eli Hurvitz Conference on Economy and Society|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israeli Democracy Index ===
The Israeli Democracy Index provides an annual assessment of the quality of democracy in Israel. It is prepared on the basis of a large-scale survey conducted every year since 2004 with a representative sample of the Israeli population, comprising around 1,500 interviewees aged 18 and above. The survey is designed to identify trends in Israeli society on substantial issues relating to the fulfillment of democratic values and goals, and to the functioning of government systems and elected officials. The Index contains an analysis of the survey results, and aims to enrich public discourse on the state of democracy in Israel by giving access to a broad database of relevant information.

Alongside this general assessment, the Index also focuses each year on a particular topic connected to Israeli democracy. The subjects chosen so far include: opinions of Israeli youth (2004); the media in Israeli democracy (2005); tenth anniversary of the Rabin assassination (2005); political parties in Israel (2006); cohesion in a fractured society (2007); civil society in Israel (2008); twentieth anniversary of mass immigration from the Soviet Union (2009); democratic principles in Israel in practice (2010); the social protest, a year on (2012); civilian opinions on the socioeconomic situation (2014); the Rabin assassination, twenty years on (2015); and opinions in Haredi society (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/centers/1159/1519|title=Israeli Democracy Index|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outstanding Parliamentarian Award ===
The Institute's Outstanding Parliamentarian Award seeks to encourage high-quality parliamentary activity and to recognize those who perform it.

The award is given annually to two Knesset members, one from the governing coalition and one from the opposition, based on a comprehensive review of several fixed criteria used to determine good parliamentary performance. First, a database is created of the activity of all [[Knesset]] members (excluding ministers, deputy ministers, the Speaker of the Knesset, and the previous year's winners of the award) across a range of parameters: attendance at committee meetings, private legislation passed during that year's Knesset session, queries submitted, agenda item proposals debated in the plenum, brief and full-length speeches delivered at plenary sessions, commissioning of research studies from the Knesset Research and Information Center, and plenary attendance, as well as reprimands and punishments received from the Knesset Ethics Committee. Next, the award committee, chaired by retired Justice Theodore Orr, convenes to discuss the list of candidates, and selects the honorees based on the data provided as well as on additional criteria, such as the broader public influence and importance of the candidates’ parliamentary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/events/16338|title=2017 Outstanding Parliamentarian Award|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Outstanding Parliamentarian Award helps improve both the quality of Knesset members’ work and the public perception of the Knesset as Israel's legislative body.

=== Political and Electoral Reform ===
The Forum for Political Reform in Israel was founded by [[Arik Carmon]], driven by “a sense of the need to launch processes that will bring about a significant change in the capabilities and functioning of the parliament in general, and in particular, of those who hold the levers of power,” as he described it. The forum was chaired by former Supreme Court President Meir Shamgar, and its members included academics, retired justices, leading public figures, and businesspeople.

The forum examined the expected impact of reforms to the electoral, governmental, and party-political systems proposed by the Israel Democracy Institute, and formulated practical proposals for legislation and public policy accordingly.

In 2015, the Israel Democracy Institute published an updated plan for political and electoral reform, proposing structural changes to the political system that would result in the formation of two major blocks of political parties providing clear alternatives for government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/publications/4222|title=Reforming Israel's Political System: A Plan for the Knesset|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Parliament'' online journal ===
Parliament is an online journal exploring topics related to governance, law, and society from both local and international perspectives. The first issue was published in print in 1993, and up until 2007 the journal contained articles on such subjects as elections in Israel and around the world, Israeli society, constitution and basic laws, religion and state, security and the armed forces, political participation, political parties, the European Union, and many others. In 2007, the format of the journal was changed so that each issue is dedicated to a single main topic. The journal was also taken online, and is no longer published in a print format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idi.org.il/parliaments|title=כתב העת פרלמנט|website=www.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human Rights and Judaism Fellowship Program ===
This is a unique scholarship program for outstanding doctoral research students in the field of human rights and Judaism, which seeks to create an intellectual foundation for shaping the human rights discourse in a Jewish nation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/centers/1157/1515|title=Human Rights and Judaism|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annual Statistical Report on Ultra-Orthodox Society in Israel ===
This is the first publication in Israel to provide a comprehensive anthology of existing quantitative data about Haredi society in Israel. It aims to provide a full and up-to-date picture of Haredi society based on statistical information and data analysis, covering a range of subject areas including demographics, education, welfare, standard of living, employment, voting patterns in Knesset elections, and lifestyles.

The Annual Statistical Report on Ultra-Orthodox Society in Israel is produced by a team of researchers from the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research and the Israel Democracy Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/haredi/2016/|title=Statistical Report on Ultra-Orthodox Society in Israel|website=en.idi.org.il|language=he|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal opinions to the Ministerial Committee on Legislation ===
The Ministerial Committee on [[Legislation]] is one of Israel's most important ministerial committees. Chaired by the Minister of Justice, it meets weekly to decide the governing coalition's position on all proposed legislation, whether government-sponsored or private members’ bills.

Every week, the Israel Democracy Institute submits a legal opinion on the bills being discussed by the committee, which it also shares with relevant Knesset committees. The opinion is written based on the areas of research expertise of the Institute's research fellows.

=== ''Security Clearance'' blog ===
''Security Clearance'' is an online forum for analyzing issues relating to both national security and democracy. It aims to contribute to the public-academic debate on national security issues from a range of perspectives, including law, ethics, and social sciences.

The blog is edited by researchers at the Israel Democracy Institute, but is open to a diverse range of views, and to writers from a variety of fields related to national security who seek to participate in serious, open, and fruitful discussions. The views expressed on the blog are strictly those of the writers themselves, and do not represent the institutions or organizations to which they belong, or the views of the blog editors or the Israel Democracy Institute.

=== Elections and Political Parties ===
This comparative tool, developed by the Israel Democracy Institute, provides an overview of Israel's elections since the founding of the state, and of the political parties that participated in each. The information provided by party includes the parties’ political platform, main leaders, the number of votes and Knesset seats won at each election, and their representation in [[government]]. The information on elections includes a description of the major issues that formed the backdrop to each, and the political context in which they were held. Additionally, full lists of candidates are provided, including those parties that did not reach the electoral threshold.

=== Comparative International Perspective ===
This tool provides in-depth political information on 50 democratic countries, including Israel. This information includes basic data on each country (population, area, language), current leaders, system of government, electoral system, type of current government, and structure of legislative authority.

In addition, it allows users to view countries’ rankings according to a number of comparative indexes, such as freedom of the press, perception of corruption, percentage of female members of parliament, GINI inequality index, and more. Users can compare multiple countries on a particular index, or compare multiple index rankings for a particular country.

=== Constitution by Consensus ===
In 2001, the Israel Democracy Institute established the Constitution by Consensus public council, chaired by former Supreme Court President Meir Shamgar, with the aim of designing a constitution for Israel that would enjoy broad public support. The council had around 100 members, including ministers and Knesset members; secular, national religious, and Haredi Jews; Arabs; right-wingers and left-wingers; and academics, jurists, religious leaders, and public figures. Over the course of five years, this public council examined the diverse range of views relating to constitutional issues in Israel, and sought to formulate the agreements and compromises that would be necessary to create a consensual constitution. The council's discussions formed the basis and inspiration for the Israel Democracy Institute's proposal for a constitution by consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.idi.org.il/publications/9127|title=Constitution by Consensus: A Constitution for the State of Israel|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Istjude''''', in the [[Nazi]] jargon, was a person with at least three ethnic [[Jews|Jewish]] grandparents. 

''Istjuden'' were legally equated with the so-called ''[[Geltungsjude]]n'' (''gelten'' = to be considered as, ''ist'' = is).

{{Jainism}}
The '''Jīva''' or '''Atman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|t|m|ən}}; {{lang-sa|आत्मन्}}) is a philosophical term used within [[Jainism]] to identify the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref name=britjivajain/&gt; As per the [[Jain cosmology]], ''jīva'' or soul is the principle of [[sentience]] and is one of the ''[[tattva (Jainism)|tattvas]]'' or one of the fundamental substances forming part of the universe. The Jain metaphysics, states Jagmanderlal Jaini, divides the universe into two independent, everlasting, co-existing and uncreated categories called the ''jiva'' (soul) and the ''ajiva'' (non-soul).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jagmanderlal Jaini|title=Outlines of Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7sKgdtJcisC|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-61567-0|pages=xxii–xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic premise of Jainism makes it a dualistic philosophy.{{sfn|Jaini|2013|p=1}} The ''jiva'', according to Jainism, is an essential part of how the process of [[karma]], [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] and the process of liberation from rebirth works.&lt;ref name=long93/&gt;

== Soul substance ==
Jains regard soul as one of the six fundamental and eternal substances (''[[Dravya (Jainism)|dravyas]]'') which forms the universe. The two states of soul substance are mentioned in the Jain texts. These are — Svābhva (pure or natural) and Vibhāva (impure or unnatural state). Souls in transmigration are in impure state and liberated ones are said to be in natural or pure state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wnoRAQAAIAAJ|p=16|title=Ācārya Kundakunda's Pañcāstikāya-sāra|author1=Kundakunda|first1=Acharya|last2=Chakravarti|first2=Appaswami|last3=Upādhye|first3=Ādinātha Neminātha|year=2001|isbn=978-81-263-1813-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jain philosophy]] is the oldest Indian philosophy that completely separates matter from the soul.&lt;ref name=britjivajain&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya - Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Theosophist'', "some religionists hold that Atman (Spirit) and Paramatman (God) are identical, while others assert that they are distinct ; but a Jain will say that Atman and Paramatman are identical as well as distinct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Theosophist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEEcAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA553|year=1609|publisher=Theosophical Publishing House|pages=553|quote=For instance, some religionists hold that Atman (Spirit) and Paramatman (God) are one, while others assert that they are distinct; but a Jain will say that Atman and Paramatman are one as well as distinct.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five vows of Jain practice are believed in Jainism to aid in freeing the ''jīva'' from karmic matter, reduce negative karmic effects and accrue positive karmic benefits.&lt;ref name=long93&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D. Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmRlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93|year=2009|publisher=I. B. Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-625-5|pages=93–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Souls and rebirth ===
[[File:Atman.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the concept of soul (in transmigration) in Jainism.

[[File:Jiva.jpg|thumb|Classification of ''Saṃsāri Jīvas'' (Transmigrating Souls) as per Jainism.]]

According to Jain philosophy, rebirth occurs through soul. Depending on the karmic particles attached to a soul, Jain theology states a being is reborn in one of four ''gatis'' (states of existence), namely, heavenly being (''[[Deva (Jainism)|deva]]''), human (''manushya''), hell being (''naraki'') and animals and plants (''[[triyancha]]'').{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=108}} Besides this there also exist a sub-microscopic life form, [[Nigoda]], possessing only one sense, i.e., of touch.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=109}}

In Jain beliefs, souls begin their journey in a primordial state, and exist in a state of consciousness continuum that is constantly evolving through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=227}} Some evolve to a higher state, some regress asserts the Jaina theory, a movement that is driven by the karma.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=227-228}} Further, Jaina traditions believe that there exist ''Abhavya'' (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain [[moksha]] (liberation).{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=226}}&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p105"&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 104–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Abhavya'' state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=225}} Jainism considers souls as pluralistic each in a karma-samsara cycle, and does not subscribe to [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] style [[nondualism]] of Hinduism, or [[Madhyamaka|Advaya]] style nondualism of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p105"/&gt;

The Jaina theosophy, like ancient [[Ajivika]], but unlike Hindu and Buddhist theosophies, asserts that each soul passes through 8,400,000 birth-situations, as they circle through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|p=228}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Padmanabh S. Jaini|title=Collected Papers on Jaina Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HPggiM7y1aYC |year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1691-6|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the soul cycles, states Padmanabh Jaini, Jainism traditions believe that it goes through five types of bodies: earth bodies, water bodies, fire bodies, air bodies and vegetable lives.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=223-224}} With all human and non-human activities, such as rainfall, agriculture, eating and even breathing, minuscule living beings are taking birth or dying, their souls are believed to be constantly changing bodies. Perturbing, harming or killing any life form, including any human being, is considered a sin in Jainism, with negative karmic effects.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=224-225}}&lt;ref name="Sethia2004p31"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tara Sethia |title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A liberated soul in Jainism is one who has gone beyond ''Saṃsāra'', is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a ''Siddha''.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=222-223}} A male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. Women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation in Jainism, particularly in the Digambara sect of Jainism;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajAEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT36|year=2013|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85773-656-7|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harveyp182&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Harvey |title=Religions in Focus: New Approaches to Tradition and Contemporary Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrTsCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182|year=2016|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-93690-8|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this view has been historically debated within Jainism and different Jaina sects have expressed different views, particularly the Shvetambara sect that believes that women too can achieve liberation from ''Saṃsāra''.&lt;ref name=harveyp182/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Paul Dundas|title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-0415266055 |pages= 55–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Buddhist texts which do not expressly or unambiguously condemn injuring or killing plants and minor life forms, Jaina texts do. Jainism considers it a bad karma to injure plants and minor life forms with negative impact on a soul's {{IAST|Saṃsāra}}.&lt;ref name=lschmithausen&gt;[[Lambert Schmithausen]] (1991), Buddhism and Nature, Studia Philologica Buddhica, The International Institute for Buddhist Studies, Tokyo Japan, pages 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; However, some texts in Buddhism and Hinduism do caution a person from injuring all life forms, including plants and seeds.&lt;ref name=lschmithausen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece (1999), Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities, {{ISBN|978-0-7748-0725-8}}, University of British Columbia Press, pages 212-217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chapple (1990), Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition, in ''Perspectives on Nonviolence'', Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4612-4458-5}}, pages 168-177;&lt;br&gt;L Alsdorf (1962), Beiträge zur Geschichte von Vegetarismus und Rinderverehrung in Indien, Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, F. Steiner Wiesbaden, pages 592-593&lt;/ref&gt;

== Real Self ==
According to the Jain text, [[Samayasāra]]:
{{quote|Know that the ''Jiva'' (soul) which rests on pure faith, knowledge, and conduct, alone is the Real Self. The one which is conditioned by the karmic matter is to be known as the impure self. – Verse 1-2-2}}

According to Vijay Jain, the souls which rest on the pure self are called the Real Self, and only ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihant]]'' and ''Siddhas'' are the Real Self.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=3}}

== Stages of spiritual development==
{{Main|Gunasthana}}
Jain texts explain that there are fourteen stages of spiritual development called ''[[Gunasthana]]''. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r5opAwAAQBAJ|title=Acarya Pujyapada's Istopadesa – the Golden Discourse|isbn=9788190363969|author1=Jain|first1=Vijay K|date=2014-03-26|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laplace, Pierre-Simon, marquis de.jpg|thumb| French scholar [[Pierre-Simon de Laplace]] (1749-1827)]]

In the [[history of science]], ''Laplace's demon'' was the first published articulation of [[causal determinism|causal or scientific determinism]], by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1814.&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/does-god-play-dice.html |last=Hawking |first=Stephen |title=Does God Play Dice? |work=Public Lectures}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to determinism, if someone (the Demon) knows the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, their past and future values for any given time are entailed; they can be calculated from the laws of [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Simon Laplace, "[https://archive.org/details/philosophicaless00lapliala A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities]" (full text).&lt;/ref&gt;

A desire to confirm or refute Laplace's demon played a vital motivating role{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} in the subsequent development of statistical [[thermodynamics]], the first of several repudiations developed by later generations of [[physics|physicists]] to the assumption of causal determinacy upon which Laplace's demon is erected.

==English translation==

{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace, ''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''&lt;ref name="Truscott"&gt;Laplace, Pierre Simon, ''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities'', translated into English from the original French 6th ed. by Truscott, F.W. and Emory, F.L., Dover Publications (New York, 1951) p.4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This intellect is often referred to as ''Laplace's demon'' (and sometimes ''Laplace's Superman'', after [[Hans Reichenbach]]). Laplace himself did not use the word "demon", which was a later embellishment. As translated into English above, he simply referred to: ''"Une intelligence... Rien ne serait incertain pour elle, et l'avenir, comme le passé, serait présent à ses yeux."'' Apparently, Laplace was not the first to evoke one such demon and strikingly similar passages can be found decades before Laplace's ''Essai philosophique'' in the work of scholars such as [[Nicolas de Condorcet]] and [[Baron D'Holbach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marij  | year = 2014 | title = On the origins and foundations of Laplacian determinism | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039368113001325 | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Science | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 24–31 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsa.2013.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems that the first who offered the image of a super-powerful calculating intelligence was [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]], whose formulation of the principle of determinism in his 1758 ''Theoria philosophiae naturalis'' turns out not only to be temporally prior to Laplace's but also—being founded on fewer metaphysical principles and more rooted in and elaborated by physical assumptions—to be more precise, complete and comprehensive than Laplace's somewhat parenthetical statement of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kožnjak Boris | year = 2015 | title = Who let the demon out? Laplace and Boscovich on determinism | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039368115000370 | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Science | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 42–52 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsa.2015.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against Laplace's demon==

===Thermodynamic irreversibility===
According to chemical engineer [[Robert Ulanowicz]], in his 1986 book ''Growth and Development'', Laplace's demon met its end with early 19th century developments of the concepts of [[irreversibility]], [[entropy]], and the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. In other words, Laplace's demon was based on the premise of [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversibility]] and classical mechanics; however, Ulanowicz points out that many thermodynamic processes are irreversible, so that if thermodynamic quantities are taken to be purely physical then no such demon is possible as one could not reconstruct past positions and momenta from the current state. [[Maximum entropy thermodynamics]] takes a very different view, considering thermodynamic variables to have a statistical basis which can be kept separate from the microscopic physics.&lt;ref&gt;http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, this theory has met criticism regarding its ability to make predictions about physics; a number of physicists and mathematicians, including Yvan Velenik of the Department of Mathematics for the [[University of Geneva]], have pointed out that maximum entropy thermodynamics essentially describes our knowledge about a system and not the system itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unige.ch/math/folks/velenik/publications.html|title=Section de Mathématiques Université de Genève|last=|first=|date=July 23, 2017|website=www.unige.ch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum mechanical irreversibility===
Due to its canonical assumption of [[determinism]], Laplace's demon is incompatible with the Copenhagen [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation]], which stipulates [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminacy]]. The interpretation of quantum mechanics is still very much open for debate and there are many who take opposing views (such as the [[Many Worlds Interpretation]] and the [[de Broglie–Bohm theory|de Broglie–Bohm interpretation]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.2719v1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chaos theory===
[[Chaos theory]] is sometimes pointed out as a contradiction to Laplace's demon: it describes how a deterministic system can nonetheless exhibit behavior that is impossible to predict: as in the [[butterfly effect]], minor variations between the starting conditions of two systems can result in major differences.&lt;ref name=SEPDeterminism&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "Causal Determinism"]&lt;/ref&gt; While this explains unpredictability in practical cases, applying it to Laplace's case is questionable: under the strict demon hypothesis all details are known—to infinite precision—and therefore variations in starting conditions are non-existent. Put another way: Chaos theory is applicable when knowledge of the system is imperfect whereas Laplace's demon assumes perfect knowledge of the system, therefore chaos theory and Laplace's demon are actually compatible with each other.

===Cantor diagonalization ===
In 2008, [[David Wolpert]] used [[Cantor diagonalization]] to disprove Laplace's demon. He did this by assuming that the demon is a computational device and showed that no two such devices can completely predict each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=David H. Wolpert| title=Physical limits of inference| journal=Physica D| volume=237| issue=9| year=2008| pages=1257–1281| doi=10.1016/j.physd.2008.03.040| arxiv=0708.1362| bibcode=2008PhyD..237.1257W}} [http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/1476h/1476%20%28Wolpert%29.pdf full text]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=P.-M. Binder |url=http://www.astro.uhh.hawaii.edu/documents/Binder_nv-toae.pdf |title=Theories of almost everything |journal=Nature |volume=455 |year=2008 |pages=884–885 |doi=10.1038/455884a |issue=7215|bibcode=2008Natur.455..884B }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Wolpert's paper was cited in 2014 in a paper of Josef Rukavicka, where a significantly simpler argument is presented that disproves Laplace's demon using Turing machines. &lt;ref&gt;Rukavicka Josef (2014), ''Rejection of Laplace's Demon, The American Mathematical Monthly [https://dx.doi.org/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.121.06.498]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent views==
There has recently been proposed a limit on the computational power of the universe, i.e. the ability of Laplace's demon to process an infinite amount of information. The limit is based on the maximum entropy of the universe, the speed of light, and the minimum amount of time taken to move information across the [[Planck length]], and the figure was shown to be about 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt; bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=If the Universe Were a Computer |author=Physical Review Focus |publisher=[[American Physical Society|APS]] |date=24 May 2002 |url=http://focus.aps.org/story/v9/st27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, anything that requires more than this amount of data cannot be computed in the amount of time that has elapsed so far in the universe.

Another theory suggests that if Laplace's demon were to occupy a parallel universe or alternate dimension from which it could determine the implied data and do the necessary calculations on an alternate and greater time line, the aforementioned time limitation would not apply. This position is for instance explained in ''[[The Fabric of Reality]]'' by [[David Deutsch]], who says that realizing a 300-[[qubit]] [[quantum computer]] would prove the existence of parallel universes carrying the computation.

Counter arguments to this can be made using [[string theory]]. Albeit, the gradients of finite theories are useful, speculative scenarios, such as space-time decompactification &lt;ref&gt;Yau, S.-T., &amp; Nadis, S. J. (2010, p. 264). The shape of inner space: String theory and the geometry of the universe's hidden dimensions. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; occurring on a faster frame, require infinities whose interpretation remains open.

===Depictions in popular culture===

In the anime series [[Rampo Kitan: Game of Laplace]], Laplace's Demon is the basis of a high school student's computer program called Dark Star. Dark Star is a program which allows for a masked vigilante, Twenty Faces, to cause the deaths of people who have escaped justice.

[[Blast of Tempest]] Chaos Theory and the Butterfly Effect are incorporated in the main theme, where time travel and breaking out of parallel universes' becomes the main plot.

In the film [[Waking Life]] a discussion of Laplace's Demon takes place, as well as a handling of the retort from Quantum Mechanics.

In the webcomic [[Dresden Codak]] this concept is used in a page melding philosophical notions and a [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons|Dungeons and Dragons]] séance entitled "Advanced dungeons and discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dresden Codak » Archive » Advanced Dungeons &amp; Discourse|url = http://dresdencodak.com/2009/01/27/advanced-dungeons-and-discourse/|accessdate = 2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this page, Kimiko Ross has to burn the second law of thermodynamics in order to summon the Demon.

The UK sitcom [[Spaced]] featured an episode called Chaos, in which the artist Brian makes an implicit reference to Laplace's Demon in a conversation about Chaos Theory. He states that reality is a mathematically predictable preordained system, even though it would "utterly defy any possibility of comprehension by even the most brilliant human mind."

In the light novel and anime series [[Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai|Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai]], it is mentioned in order to try define the situation in which the main protagonist is repeating a specific day.

Rapurasu no Majo (Laplace's witch), a 2015 novel by Japanese author [[Keigo Higashino]]. It was adapted to [[Laplace's Witch (film)|film in 2018]], directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and starring [[Shō Sakurai]].

'''Lean enterprise''' is a practice focused on value creation for the end customer with minimal waste and processes. The term has historically been associated with [[lean manufacturing]] and [[Six Sigma]] (or [[Lean Six Sigma]]) due to lean principles being popularized by [[Toyota]] in the automobile manufacturing industry and subsequently the electronics and internet software industries.

==Principles and variants==

Principles for lean enterprise derive from [[lean manufacturing]] and [[Six Sigma]] principles:

There are five principles, originating from lean manufacturing, outlined by James Womack and Daniel Jones&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maskell.com/lean_accounting/subpages/lean_manufacturing/lt_the_principles_of_lean_manufacturing.html Maskell - The Principles of Lean Manufacturing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Lean_Thinking.html?id=2eWHaAyiNrgC James Womack &amp; Daniel Jones - Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth In Your Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Value: Understand clearly what value the customer wants for the product or service.
* Value Stream: The entire flow of a product's or service's life cycle. In other words, from raw materials, production of the product or service, customer delivery, customer use, and final disposal.
* Flow: Keep the value stream moving. If it's not moving, it's creating waste and less value for the customer.
* Pull: Do not make anything until the customer orders it. 
* Perfection: Systematically and continuously remove root causes of poor quality from production processes.

There are key lean enterprise principles originating from [[Lean Six Sigma]] principles. These principles focus on eliminating 8 varieties of waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|Muda]]) and form the acronym DOWNTIME:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://flevy.com/lean-management | title=Lean Management | publisher=Flevy | accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Defects
* Overproduction
* Waiting
* Non-Utilized Talent
* Transportation
* Inventory
* Motion
* Extra-Processing

These 8 varieties of waste are derivative from the original 7 wastes as defined in the Toyota Production System. They are:
* Transportation
* Inventory
* Motion
* Waiting
* Overproduction
* Over-processing
* Defects

The 8th waste of non-utilized talent was not recognized until post-Americanization of the Toyota Production System.

The [[lean startup]] principles, developed from 2008 from [[lean manufacturing]], also now contribute to our understanding of lean enterprise:

* Eliminate wasteful practices
* Increase value producing practices
* Customer feedback during product development
* Build what customers want
* [[Performance indicator|KPI]]s
* Continuous deployment process

==History==

===Early 1900s: Ford, GM &amp; Toyota Systems===

[[Henry Ford]] developed a process called [[assembly line]] production. This is a manufacturing process in which parts are added as the assembly moves from work station to work station where parts are added in sequence until final assembly is produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/moving-assembly-line-at-ford History.com - Moving Assembly Line at Ford]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Sloan]] of [[General Motors]] further developed the concept of assembly line production by building a process called [[mass production]] that allowed scale and variety. This process enabled large amounts of standardized products to run through assembly lines while still being able to produce more variety and compete against Ford's single offering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Labor/L_Overview/L_Overview4.htm Stephen Meyer - The Degradation of Work Revisited: Workers and Technology in the American Auto Industry, 1900-2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kiichiro Toyoda]] studied the Ford production system and adapted the process in order to have smaller production quantities. He built a production system called [[Just-in-Time Manufacturing]] for [[Toyota]] along with [[Taichi Ohno]]. It's worth noting too that [[kaizen]], the process of continuous improvement, was developed in the 1950s by [[Eiji Toyoda]] along with the [[Toyota Production System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sae.org/manufacturing/lean/column/leanjun01.htm | title=Lean Manufacturing and the Toyota Production System | publisher=SAE International | accessdate=20 May 2015 | author=Becker, Ronald M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s &amp; 1990s: Motorola===

New innovations in lean enterprise moved away from machine technology to electronic technology.

Another development was management techniques from [[Motorola]] commonly referred to as [[Six Sigma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sixsigmainstitute.com/sixsigma/index_6sigma.shtml Six Sigma Institute - History of Six Sigma at Motorola]&lt;/ref&gt; This management technique was built off of mass production principles with more focus on minimizing variability. Applying Six Sigma principles led to reduced cycle time, reduced pollution, reduced costs, increased customer satisfaction, and increased profits.

===1990s &amp; 2000s: Internet companies===

New innovations in lean enterprise moved away from electronic manufacturing to internet and software technology. Before, during, and after the [[dot-com bubble]], internet and software enterprises originally did not place emphasis on lean enterprise principles for efficient usage and allocation of capital and labor due to accessible funds from [[venture capital]] and [[capital markets]]. The idea of "build it and they will come" became common practice as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/dotcon/thinking/game.html KQED - Inside the dotcom IPO game]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[dot-com bubble]], inspired by the [[Agile Manifesto]], internet and software companies began operating under agile software development practices such as [[Extreme programming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html Kent Beck et al. -  History: The Agile Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the agile software movement, companies (especially startups) applied both lean enterprise and agile software principles together in order to develop new products or even new companies more efficiently and based on validated customer demand. Very early practices of lean enterprise and agile software principles was commonly referred to as [[lean startup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inc.com/magazine/201110/eric-ries-usability-testing-product-development.html Inc. - Creating the Lean Startup]&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2010, more and more enterprises are adopting this new branch of lean enterprise ([[lean startup]]) since it provides principles and methodologies for non-internet enterprises to enter in new markets or offer goods and services in new form factors with less time, labor, and capital. For internet and software enterprises (by tradition), the [[Lean startup]] variant of lean enterprise enabled them to remain competitive with new technologies and services that are rapidly coming out to market without exclusively resorting to [[mergers and acquisitions]], and being able to retain internal innovation ecosystem competency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grasshopperherder.com/lean-enterprise-innovation-ecosystems/ Tristan Kromer - Lean Enterprise &amp; Innovation Ecosystems]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/04/how-ge-applies-lean-startup-practices/ Brad Power - How GE Applies Lean Startup Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordstrompeoplelab.com/how-intuit-is-applying-lean-startup-and-design-thinking-principles/ Bruce Upbin - How Intuit Is Applying Lean Startup And Design Thinking Principles]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orderliness''' is associated with other qualities such as [[cleanliness]] and [[diligence]], and the desire for order and symmetry, and is generally considered to be a desirable quality. 

In [[psychology]], an excessive desire for orderliness can be associated with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] and the term ''[[anal retentive]]'', (or simply ''anal'')—from [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]]—is used [[conversation]]ally to describe a person with such attention to orderliness and detail that it becomes close to a [[mental disorder]]. On the other side, excessive disorderliness may be associated with a tendency to [[hoarding|hoard]], to [[collecting|collect]] objects compulsively ([[compulsive hoarding]]).

[[Professional organizing]] services support individuals and organizations find ways to achieve and maintain ways to be organized, including [[Homemaking#De-cluttering|decluttering]] and maintaining an orderly environment.

In [[aeronautical engineering]], '''overall pressure ratio''', or '''overall compression ratio''', is the ratio of the [[stagnation pressure]] as measured at the front and rear of the compressor of a [[gas turbine]] engine. The terms ''compression ratio'' and ''pressure ratio'' are used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;"The aircraft Gas Turbine Engine and its operation" P&amp;W Oper.Instr.200, United Technologies Pratt &amp; whitney December, 1982, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; '''Overall compression ratio''' also means the ''overall cycle pressure ratio'' which includes intake ram.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/tocs/210525592.pdf p.695&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of overall pressure ratios==
Early jet engines had limited pressure ratios due to construction inaccuracies of the compressors and various material limits. For instance, the [[Junkers Jumo 004]] from [[World War II]] had an overall pressure ratio 3.14:1.  The immediate post-war [[Snecma Atar]] improved this marginally to 5.2:1. Improvements in materials, compressor blades, and especially the introduction of multi-spool engines with several different rotational speeds, led to the much higher pressure ratios common today.

Modern civilian engines generally operate between 40 and 55:1. The highest in-service is the [[General Electric GEnx]]-1B/75 with an OPR of 58 at the end of the [[Climb (aeronautics)|climb]] to cruise altitude (Top of Climb) and 47 for [[takeoff]] at [[sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://leehamnews.com/2016/10/28/bjorns-corner-turbofan-engine-challenges-part-1/ |title= Bjorn’s Corner: Turbofan engine challenges, Part 1 |author= Bjorn Fehrm |date= October 28, 2016 |work= Leeham News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of high overall pressure ratios==
Generally speaking, a higher overall pressure ratio implies higher efficiency, but the engine will usually weigh more, so there is a compromise.
A high overall pressure ratio permits a larger area ratio nozzle to be fitted on the jet engine. This means that more of the heat energy is converted to jet speed, and energetic efficiency improves.  This is reflected in improvements in the engine's [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]].

==Disadvantages of high overall pressure ratios==
One of the primary limiting factors on pressure ratio in modern designs is that the air heats up as it is compressed. As the air travels through the compressor stages it can reach temperatures that pose a material failure risk for the compressor blades. This is especially true for the last compressor stage, and the outlet temperature from this stage is a common [[figure of merit]] for engine designs.

Military engines are often forced to work under conditions that maximize the heating load. For instance, the [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark]] was required to operate at speeds of Mach 1.1 at [[sea level]]. As a side-effect of these wide operating conditions, and generally older technology in most cases, military engines typically have lower overall pressure ratios. The [[Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30]] used on the F-111 had a pressure ratio of about 20:1, while newer engines like the [[General Electric F110]] and [[Pratt &amp; Whitney F135]] have improved this to about 30:1.

An additional concern is weight. A higher compression ratio implies a heavier engine, which in turn costs fuel to carry around. Thus, for a particular construction technology and set of flight plans an optimal overall pressure ratio can be determined.

The contribution of intake to the overall pressure ratio, defined as the ratio of the stagnation pressure as measured at the front and rear of the intake is negative in supersonic flight, and approximately non-existent in subsonic flight. Therefore with the definition given in the first sentence in this article, the overall effective pressure ratio of Concorde taking intake into account is less than without it. In other words less than 15.5:1 as in the table.
Information from the source given above obviously uses a different definition for overall pressure ratio, comparing static pressures instead of stagnation pressures, and is misleading given the definition in this article as it is.
{{notelist}}

==Differences from other similar terms==
The term should not be confused with the more familiar term [[compression ratio]] applied to [[reciprocating engine]]s. Compression ratio is a ratio of volumes.  In the case of the [[Otto cycle]] reciprocating engine, the maximum expansion of the charge is limited by the mechanical movement of the pistons (or rotor), and so the compression can be measured by simply comparing the volume of the cylinder with the piston at the top and bottom of its motion. The same is not true of the "open ended" gas turbine, where operational and structural considerations are the limiting factors. Nevertheless, the two terms are similar in that they both offer a quick way of determining overall efficiency relative to other engines of the same class.

The broadly equivalent measure of [[rocket engine]] efficiency is chamber pressure/exit pressure, and this ratio can be over 2000 for the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]].

==Compression ratio versus overall pressure ratio==
[[File:Compression ratio versus pressure ratio.png|thumb|Compression ratio versus pressure ratio]]

Compression ratio and overall pressure ratio would be interrelated as follows, if the first sentence in this article would be incorrect, given as it is, what follows is valid only for static pressures, but not overall pressure ratios, as compresson while slowing down flow without doing work is not changing stagnation pressure at all, and in supersonic flow with shock waves stagnation pressure will be less than 1 with &gt; 1 compression ratio:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Compression ratio
|| 2:1  || 3:1 || 5:1 || 10:1 || 15:1 || 20:1 || 25:1 || 35:1
|-
! Pressure ratio
|| 2.64:1 || 4.66:1 ||9.52:1 || 25.12:1 || 44.31:1 || 66.29:1 || 90.60:1 || 145.11:1
|}

The reason for this difference is that compression ratio is defined via the volume reduction:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{CR}=\frac{V_1}{V_2}&lt;/math&gt;,
while pressure ratio is defined as the [[pressure]] increase:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{PR}=\frac{P_2}{P_1}&lt;/math&gt;.
In calculating the pressure ratio, we assume that an [[adiabatic compression]] is carried out (i.e. that no heat energy is supplied to the gas being compressed, and that any temperature rise is solely due to the compression). We also assume that air is a perfect gas. With these two assumptions, we can define the relationship between change of volume and change of pressure as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;P_1 V_1^\gamma = P_2 V_2^\gamma \Rightarrow
\frac{P_2}{P_1}= \left( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \right)^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ratio of specific heats]] (air: approximately 1.4).
The values in the table above are derived using this formula. Note that in reality the ratio of specific heats changes with temperature and that significant deviations from adiabatic behavior will occur.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''pointed space''' is a [[topological space]] with a distinguished point, the '''basepoint'''. The distinguished point is just simply one particular point, picked out from the space, and given a name, such as ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, that remains unchanged during subsequent discussion, and is kept track of during all operations.

Maps of pointed spaces ('''based maps''') are [[continuous (topology)|continuous maps]] preserving basepoints, i.e., a map ''f'' between a pointed space ''X'' with basepoint ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and a pointed space ''Y'' with basepoint ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a based map if it is continuous with respect to the topologies of ''X'' and ''Y'' and if ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This is usually denoted
:''f'' : (''X'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;rarr; (''Y'', ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).
Pointed spaces are important in [[algebraic topology]], particularly in [[homotopy theory]], where many constructions, such as the [[fundamental group]], depend on a choice of basepoint.

The [[pointed set]] concept is less important; it is anyway the case of a pointed [[discrete space]].

Pointed spaces are often taken as a special case of the [[relative topology]], where the subset is a single point.  Thus, much of [[homotopy theory]] is usually developed on pointed spaces, and then moved to relative topologies in [[algebraic topology]].

==Category of pointed spaces==
The [[class (set theory)|class]] of all pointed spaces forms a [[category (mathematics)|category]] '''Top'''&lt;sub&gt;•&lt;/sub&gt; with basepoint preserving continuous maps as [[morphism]]s. Another way to think about this category is as the [[comma category]], ({•} ↓ '''Top''') where {•} is any one point space and '''Top''' is the [[category of topological spaces]]. (This is also called a [[coslice category]] denoted {•}/'''Top'''.) Objects in this category are continuous maps {•} → ''X''. Such morphisms can be thought of as picking out a basepoint in ''X''. Morphisms in ({•} ↓ '''Top''') are morphisms in '''Top''' for which the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]]:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
[[Image:PointedSpace-01.png]]
&lt;/div&gt;

It is easy to see that commutativity of the diagram is equivalent to the condition that ''f'' preserves basepoints.

As a pointed space, {•} is a [[zero object]] in '''Top'''&lt;sub&gt;•&lt;/sub&gt;, while it is only a [[terminal object]] in '''Top'''.

There is a [[forgetful functor]] '''Top'''&lt;sub&gt;•&lt;/sub&gt; → '''Top''' which "forgets" which point is the basepoint. This functor has a [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] which assigns to each topological space ''X'' the [[disjoint union]] of ''X'' and a one-point space {•} whose single element is taken to be the basepoint.

==Operations on pointed spaces==
*A '''subspace''' of a pointed space ''X'' is a [[subspace (topology)|topological subspace]] ''A'' ⊆ ''X'' which shares its basepoint with ''X'' so that the [[inclusion map]] is basepoint preserving.
*One can form the '''[[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]]''' of a pointed space ''X'' under any [[equivalence relation]]. The basepoint of the quotient is the image of the basepoint in ''X'' under the quotient map.
*One can form the '''[[product (category theory)|product]]''' of two pointed spaces (''X'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), (''Y'', ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) as the [[product (topology)|topological product]] ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' with (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) serving as the basepoint.
*The '''[[coproduct]]''' in the category of pointed spaces is the ''[[wedge sum]]'', which can be thought of as the 'one-point union' of spaces.
*The '''[[smash product]]''' of two pointed spaces is essentially the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]] of the direct product and the wedge sum. We would like to say that the smash product turns the category of pointed spaces into a [[symmetric monoidal category]] with the pointed [[0-sphere]] as the unit object, but this is false for general spaces: the associativity condition might fail. But it is true for some more restricted categories of spaces, such as [[compactly generated space|compactly generated]] [[weak Hausdorff space|weak Hausdorff]] ones.
*The '''[[reduced suspension]]''' Σ''X'' of a pointed space ''X'' is (up to a [[homeomorphism]]) the smash product of ''X'' and the pointed circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
*The reduced suspension is a functor from the category of pointed spaces to itself. This functor is [[left adjoint]] to the functor &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; taking a pointed space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to its [[loop space]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega X&lt;/math&gt;.

The first Cardiff Mardi Gras took place in [[Bute Park]], Cardiff, in September 1999. The event was an immediate success with over 5,000 attending.{{fact|date=October 2017}} By 2001, the number of attendees had grown to 20,000.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pridecymru.co.uk/about/ | title=About | work=Pride Cymru | location=UK | accessdate=2016-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2016pics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/best-pictures-pride-cymru-festival-11746182|title=The best pictures from the Pride Cymru festival 2016|publisher=[[Wales Online]]|author=Liz Day|date=14 August 2016|access-date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 event was cancelled owing to lack of support, but it has been held every year from 2009.{{fact|date=October 2017}} Cardiff Mardi Gras became a registered charity in 2010 and changed its name to Pride Cymru in 2014. Since 2012 the event has included a parade through Cardiff city centre.&lt;ref name=2016pics /&gt;

==Controversy: Cardiff Council==
In 2016, there was a rumour started that [[Cardiff Council]] had dropped support for the event.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-37045582 |publisher= [[BBC News]] |date= 13 August 2016 |access-date= 23 October 2017 |title= Pride Cymru: Uncertainty over 2017 LGBT event in Cardiff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an official statement, the Pride Cymru chair said she was told by the council that they'd "made a choice not to allow events during the summer of 2017".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/fears-pride-cymru-find-new-11746674 |date= 18 August 2016|access-date=1 August 2017 |title= Fears Pride Cymru will have to find a new home because of Champions League fanzone|publisher=[[Wales Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was strong local opposition to the decision and the issue prompted a personal appeal from Sir [[Ian McKellen]] in which he compared the negative attitude toward the LGBT community with that seen in India and China on his travels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-37253872|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2 September 2016|access-date=1 August 2017|title=Sir Ian McKellen: Pride 2017 uncertainty 'alarming'}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under intense pressure, Cardiff Council reversed its decision and awarded Pride Cymru a slot later in August to move it away from other major events taking place. The organisers would instead take over the running of the Council's [[Cardiff Big Weekend|Big Weekend]] open-air music festival.&lt;ref name="bigweekend"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/cardiffs-big-weekend-coming-back-12344130 | title=Cardiff's Big Weekend is coming back – and organisers promise it will be bigger and better | first=Ruth | last=Mosalski | work=WalesOnline | location=UK | date=20 December 2016 | accessdate=20 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cardiff's Big Weekend==
In 2017, Pride Cymru took control of the [[Cardiff Council]]'s 'Big Weekend' and combined it with their LGBT pride parade to form [[Cardiff Big Weekend|Pride Cymrus Big Weekend]].&lt;ref name="bigweekend" /&gt; {{Asof|2017}}, the event is due to continue for at least five years.&lt;ref name="bbc17"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-40964316 | title=Pride Cymru: Under threat event 'safe for five years' | first=Chris | last=Wood | work=[[BBC News]] | publisher=[[BBC]] | location=UK | date=26 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "'''Red Scare'''" is promotion of widespread fear by a society or state about a potential rise of [[communism]], [[anarchism]], or [[radical leftism]]. The term is most often used to refer to two periods in the history of the United States with this name. The [[First Red Scare]], which occurred immediately after [[World War I]], revolved around a perceived threat from the [[Labor history of the United States|American labor movement]], [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchist]] [[revolution]] and [[political radicalism]]. The [[McCarthyism|Second Red Scare]], which occurred immediately after [[World War II]], was preoccupied with national or foreign communists [[espionage|infiltrating]] or [[subversion|subverting]] U.S. society or the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].

==First Red Scare (1917–1920)==
{{main|First Red Scare}}
[[File:1919 Political Cartoon (14759129762) (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|Political cartoon from 1919 depicting the Russian revolution's impact on the Paris peace talks]]
The first Red Scare began following the [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the intensely patriotic years of World War I as anarchist and left-wing social agitation aggravated national, social, and political tensions. Political scientist, and former member of the Communist Party [[Murray Levin|Murray B. Levin]] wrote that the Red Scare was "a nationwide anti-radical hysteria provoked by a mounting fear and anxiety that a Bolshevik revolution in America was imminent—a revolution that would change Church, home, marriage, civility, and the American way of Life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levin | first = Murray B.| title = Political Hysteria in America: The Democratic Capacity for Repression | publisher = Basic Books | year = 1971 | page = 29 | isbn = 0-465-05898-1|oclc=257349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnKFAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers exacerbated those political fears into anti-foreign sentiment because varieties of radical [[anarchism]] were becoming popular as possible solutions to poverty, often by recent European immigrants (cf. [[hyphenated-Americans]]). When the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) backed several [[Strike action|labor strike]]s in 1916 and 1917, the press portrayed them as "radical threats to American society" inspired by "left-wing, foreign ''agents provocateurs''". Those on the side of the IWW claim that the press "misrepresented legitimate labor strikes" as "crimes against society", "conspiracies against the government", and "plots to establish communism".&lt;ref&gt;''Political Hysteria in America: The Democratic Capacity for Repression'' (1971), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents, on the other hand, saw these as an extension of the radical, anarchist foundations of the IWW, which contends that all workers should be united as a [[social class]] and that [[capitalism]] and the [[wage system]] should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.org/culture/official/preamble.shtml |title=Preamble to the IWW Constitution |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World |accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Come unto me, ye opprest.jpg|thumb|left|205px|A "European [[Anarchist]]" attempts to destroy the [[Statue of Liberty]] in this 1919 political cartoon.]]
[[File:Palmer Bombing.jpg|thumb|right|A bomb blast badly damaged the residence of Attorney General Mitchell Palmer in the spring of 1919.]]
In April 1919, authorities discovered a plot for mailing 36 bombs to prominent members of the U.S. political and economic [[The Establishment|establishment]]: [[J. P. Morgan Jr.]], [[John D. Rockefeller]], [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer]], and immigration officials. On June 2, 1919, in eight cities, [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|eight bombs simultaneously exploded]]. One target was the [[Washington, D.C.]], house of [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] Palmer, where the explosion killed the bomber, who evidence indicated was an [[Italian-American]] radical from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Afterwards, Palmer ordered the U.S. Justice Department to launch the [[Palmer Raids]] (1919–21).&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;

Yet, in 1918, before the bombings, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] had pressured the Congress to legislate the anti-anarchist [[Sedition Act of 1918]] to protect wartime morale by deporting putatively undesirable political people. Law professor [[David D. Cole]] reports that President Wilson's "federal government consistently targeted alien radicals, deporting them&amp;nbsp;... for their speech or associations, making little effort to distinguish terrorists from ideological [[dissident]]s."&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cole | first = David D. | authorlink = David D.

Initially, the press praised the raids; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, "There is no time to waste on hairsplitting over [the] infringement of liberty", and ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the injuries inflicted upon the arrested were "souvenirs of the new attitude of aggressiveness which had been assumed by the Federal agents against Reds and suspected-Reds".&lt;ref&gt;

Defensively, Palmer then warned that a government-deposing left-wing [[revolution]] would begin on 1 May 1920 — [[International Workers Day|May Day]], the International Workers' Day. When it failed to happen, he was ridiculed and lost much credibility. Strengthening the legal criticism of Palmer was that fewer than 600 deportations were substantiated with evidence, out of the thousands of resident aliens arrested and deported. In July 1920, Palmer's once-promising Democratic Party [[United States presidential election, 1920|bid]] for the U.S. presidency failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hakim | first = Joy | authorlink = | title = War, Peace, and All That Jazz | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1995 | location = New York, New York | pages = 34–36 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=lC0aOAAACAAJ&amp;dq=War,+Peace,+and+all+that+Jazz | doi =  | isbn = 0-19-509514-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wall Street]] was [[Wall Street bombing|bombed]] on September 2, 1920, near [[Federal Hall National Memorial]] and the [[23 Wall Street|JP Morgan Bank]].

==Second Red Scare (1947–57)==
{{main|McCarthyism}}
[[Image:Joseph McCarthy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[US Senate|Senator]] [[Joseph McCarthy]], namesake of [[McCarthyism]]]]
The second Red Scare occurred after [[World War II]] (1939–45), and was popularly known as "McCarthyism" after its most famous supporter, [[US Senate|Senator]] [[Joseph McCarthy]]. McCarthyism coincided with increased popular fear of communist [[espionage]] consequent to a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948–49), the [[Chinese Civil War]], the confessions of spying for the Soviet Union given by several high-ranking U.S. government officials, and the [[Korean War]].

===Internal causes of communist fear===
The events of the late 1940s, early 1950s - the trial of [[Ethel and Julius Rosenberg]] (1953), the trial of [[Whittaker Chambers#The Hiss case|Alger Hiss]], the [[Iron Curtain]] (1945–1991) around [[Eastern Europe]], and the [[Soviet Union]]'s first [[Nuclear testing|nuclear weapon test]] in 1949 ([[RDS-1]]) - surprised the American public, influencing popular opinion about U.S. National Security, that, in turn, connected to fear of the Soviet Union hydrogen-bombing the United States, and fear of the [[CPUSA|Communist Party of the United States of America]] (CPUSA).

In Canada, the 1946 [[Kellock–Taschereau Commission]] investigated espionage after top secret documents concerning [[RDX]], [[radar]] and other weapons were handed over to the Soviets by a domestic spy-ring.&lt;ref&gt;Canada. The report of the Royal Commission appointed under Order in Council P. C. 411 of February 5, 1946 to investigate the facts relating to and the circumstances surrounding the communication, by public officials and other persons in positions of trust, of secret and confidential information to agents of a foreign power, June 27, 1946. Ottawa: E. Cloutier, Printer to the King, 1946.{{verify source|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], former [[CPUSA]] members and NKVD spies, [[Elizabeth Bentley]] and [[Whittaker Chambers]], testified that Soviet [[espionage|spies]] and communist sympathizers had penetrated the U.S. government before, during and after World War II. Other U.S. citizen spies confessed to their acts of espionage in situations where the statute of limitations on prosecuting them had run out. In 1949, anti–communist fear, and fear of American traitors, was aggravated by the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] winning the [[Chinese Civil War]] against the Western-sponsored [[Kuomintang]], their founding of the [[People's Republic of China]], and later [[Korean war#Chinese intervention|Chinese intervention]] in the [[Korean War]] (1950–53) against U.S. ally [[South Korea]].

A few of the events during the Red Scare were also due to a power struggle between director of FBI [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Hoover had instigated and aided some of the investigations of members of the CIA with "leftist" history, like [[Cord Meyer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKmockingbird.htm Mocking Bird] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619050903/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKmockingbird.htm |date=2006-06-19 }}, John Simkin, Spartacus Schoolnet&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict could also be traced back to the conflict between Hoover and [[William J. Donovan]], going back to the first Red Scare, but especially during World War II. Donovan ran the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] (CIA's predecessor). They had differing opinions on the nature of the alliance with the Soviet Union, conflicts over jurisdiction, conflicts of personality, the OSS hiring of communists and criminals as agents, etc.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''[[Wedge: The Secret War between the FBI and CIA]]'', by Mark Riebling&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
{{See also|Smith Act trials of communist party leaders}}
By the 1930s, communism had become an attractive economic [[ideology]], particularly among labor leaders and intellectual elites. By 1939, the CPUSA had about 50,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnpoll |first=Bernard K.|year=1994 |title=A Documentary History of the Communist Party of the United States: Volume III Unite and Fight, 1934–1935|publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |pages=xv |url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=99389227|isbn=978-0-313-28506-6 |oclc=27976811}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, soon after World War II began in Europe, the U.S. Congress legislated the [[Smith Act|Alien Registration Act]] (aka the '''Smith Act''', 18 USC §&amp;nbsp;2385) making it a crime to "knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise or teach the duty, necessity, desirability or propriety of overthrowing the Government of the United States or of any State by force or violence, or for anyone to organize any association which teaches, advises or encourages such an overthrow, or for anyone to become a member of or to affiliate with any such association"—and required Federal registration of all [[alien (law)|foreign nationals]]. Although principally deployed against communists, the Smith Act was also used against [[right-wing]] political threats such as the [[German-American Bund]], and the perceived racial disloyalty of the [[Japanese-American]] population, (''cf.'' [[hyphenated-Americans]]).

In 1941, after [[Nazi Germany]] invaded the Soviet Union, the CPUSA's official position became pro-war, opposing [[labor strike]]s in the weapons industry and supporting the U.S. war effort against the [[Axis Powers]]. With the slogan "Communism is Twentieth-Century Americanism", the chairman, [[Earl Browder]], advertised the CPUSA's integration to the political mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Countryman|first=Edward|title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History|chapter=Communism|editor1-last=Kazin|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-first=Rebecca|editor2-last=Edwards|editor3-first=Adam|editor3-last=Rothman|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-12971-1|oclc=320801248|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hqpJEJp7cUC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=%22Communism+is+Twentieth-Century+Americanism%22+1941#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Communism%20is%20Twentieth-Century%20Americanism%22%201941&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 3, 2011|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Trotskyist]] [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] opposed U.S. participation in the war and supported labor strikes, even in the war-effort industry. For this reason, [[James P. Cannon]] and other SWP leaders were convicted per the Smith Act.

In March 1947, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed [[Executive Order 9835]], creating the "Federal Employees Loyalty Program" establishing political-loyalty review boards who determined the "Americanism" of Federal Government employees, and recommended termination of those who had confessed to spying for the Soviet Union, as well as some suspected of being "Un-American". It also was the template for several state legislatures' loyalty acts, such as California's [[Levering Act]]. The [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC)]] and the committees of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] ([[U.S. Republican Party|R.]], [[Wisconsin|Wisc.]]) conducted character investigations of "American communists" (actual and alleged), and their roles in (real and imaginary) espionage, propaganda, and subversion favoring the Soviet Union—in the process revealing the extraordinary breadth of the Soviet spy network in infiltrating the federal government; the process also launched the successful political career of [[Richard Nixon]], and [[Robert F. Kennedy]],&lt;ref name="NYUhistory"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Hiss Case in History |url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/history.html |work=The Hiss Case in Story |publisher=[[Harvard]], [[NYU]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-07-28 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPvH8ee3?url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/history.html |archivedate=May 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as that of Joseph McCarthy.

Senator McCarran introduced the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] of 1950 that was passed by the U.S. Congress and which modified a great deal of law to restrict civil liberties in the name of security. President Truman declared the act a "mockery of the Bill of Rights" and a "long step toward totalitarianism" because it represented a government restriction on the freedom of opinion. He vetoed the act but his veto was overridden by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lane|first=Frederick S.|title=American Privacy: The 400-year History of Our Most Contested Right|year=2009|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0-8070-4441-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoD25PQk5y0C&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=%22long+step+toward+totalitarianism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22long%20step%20toward%20totalitarianism%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 3, 2011|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the bill eventually was repealed.

The Second Red Scare profoundly altered the temper of American society. Its later characterizations may be seen as contributory to works of feared communist espionage, such as the film ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952), about parent's suspicions their son is a spy. Abundant accounts in narrative forms contained themes of the infiltration, subversion, invasion, and destruction of American society by un–American ''thought''. In [[science fiction]] movies like ''[[The Thing from Another World|The Thing]]'' (1951), tales of alien humanoid beings abounded. Even a baseball team, the [[Cincinnati Reds]], temporarily renamed themselves the "Cincinnati Redlegs" to avoid the money-losing and career-ruining connotations inherent in being ball-playing "Reds" (communists).

In 1995, the American government revealed details of the [[Venona Project]], which when combined with the opening of the [[USSR]] [[ComIntern]] archives, provided substantial validation of intelligence gathering, outright spying, and policy influencing, by Americans on behalf of the Soviet Union, from 1940 through 1980.&lt;ref name="NYUvenona"&gt;{{cite web |title=Venona and the Russian Files |work=The Hiss Case in Story |publisher=[[Harvard]], [[NYU]] |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-07-28 |url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/venona.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPw0sDhn?url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/venona.html |archivedate=May 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/commissions/secrecy/pdf/12hist1.pdf| format=PDF| title=A Brief Account of the American Experience| author=Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy| work=Report of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy.

[[Image:Seal Eg.png|200px|thumb|left|Chinese characters for the words 'seal script' in [[regular script]] 
(left) and seal script (right).]]
'''Seal script''' ({{zh|t=篆書|p=zhuànshū}}) is an ancient [[Chinese script styles|style]] of writing [[Chinese characters]] that was common throughout the latter half of the 1st millennium BCE. It evolved organically out of the [[Zhou dynasty]] [[bronze script|script]]. The [[Qin (state)|Qin]] variant of seal script eventually became the standard, and was adopted as the formal script for all of China during the [[Qin dynasty]]. It was still widely used for decorative engraving and [[seal (East Asia)|seal]]s (name chops, or signets) in the [[Han dynasty]]. The literal translation of the Chinese name for seal script, {{lang|zh|篆書}} (''{{transl|zh|zhuànshū}}''), is ''decorative engraving script'', a name coined during the Han dynasty, which reflects the then-reduced role of the script for the writing of ceremonial inscriptions.

== Types ==
The general term '''seal script''' can be used to refer to several types of seal script, including the [[Large Seal Script|Large or Great Seal script]] ({{lang|zh|大篆}} ''{{transl|zh|Dàzhuàn}}''; Japanese ''{{transl|ja|daiten}}''; Korean ''{{transl|ko|daejeon}}''; Vietnamese  ''{{transl|vi|đại triện}}'') and the lesser or [[Xiaozhuan|Small Seal Script]] ({{lang|zh|小篆}} ''{{transl|zh|Xiǎozhuàn}}''; Japanese ''{{transl|ja|shōten}}''; Korean ''{{transl|ko|sojeon}}''; Vietnamese ''{{transl|vi|tiểu triện}}''). Most commonly, without any other clarifying terminology, it refers to the latter of these. The term ''Large Seal script'' itself can also cover a broad variety of scripts, including a variation of Qin writing earlier than the small seal characters, but also the earlier Western Zhou forms, or even oracle bone characters as well.  Since the term is an imprecise one, not clearly referring to any specific historical script and not used with any consensus in meaning, modern scholars tend to avoid it, and when referring to ''seal script'', generally mean the (small) seal script of the Qin system, that is, the lineage which evolved in the state of Qin during the Spring and Autumn&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Warring States period]] and which was standardized under the First Emperor.

== Evolution==
There were several different variants of seal script which developed independently in each kingdom during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. One of these, the [[Bird-worm seal script|"bird-worm" seal script]] ({{lang|zh|鳥蟲文}}), is named for its intricate decorations on the defining strokes, and was used in the Kingdoms of [[State of Wu|Wu]], [[State of Chu|Chu]], and [[State of Yue|Yue]]. It was found on several artifacts including the [[Spear of Fuchai]] and the [[Sword of Goujian]]. This seal script variant is very difficult to read.

As a southern state, Chu was close to the Wu-Yue influences. Chu produced broad bronze swords that were similar to Wuyue swords, but not as intricate. Chu also used the bird-worm style, which was borrowed by the Wu and Yue states.

== Unified small seal script==
{{main|Small Seal Script}}
[[File:XiaozhuanQinquan.jpg|320px|thumb|left|Small seal script [[epigraphy|epigraph]] on the standard weight prototype of [[Qin dynasty]]. Made from [[iron]], this prototype was unearthed in 1973 at [[Wendeng]], [[Shandong]] Province.]]
The script of the Qin system (the writing as exemplified in bronze inscriptions in the state of Qin before unification) had evolved organically from the Zhou script starting in the Spring and Autumn period.&lt;ref name="Chén Zhāoróng 2003"&gt;Chén Zhāoróng (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning around the Warring States period, it became vertically elongated with a regular appearance. This was the period of maturation of Small Seal script. It was systematized by prime minister [[Li Si]] during the reign of the First Emperor of China [[Qin Shi Huang]] through elimination of most variant structures, and was imposed as the nationwide standard.&lt;ref name="Chén Zhāoróng 2003"/&gt; Through Chinese commentaries, it is known that Li Si compiled the ''[[Cangjiepian]]'', a partially-extant wordbook listing some 3,300 [[Chinese characters]] in small seal script. Their form is characterized by being less rectangular and more squarish.

[[File:BronzePlaque-EdictOfSecondEmperor-Qin-ROM-May8-08.png|thumb|right|125px|Edict of the second Qin emperor, in seal script]]In the popular history of Chinese characters, the Small Seal script is traditionally considered to be the ancestor of the [[clerical script]], which in turn gave rise to all of the other scripts in use today. However, recent archaeological discoveries and scholarship have led some scholars to conclude that the direct ancestor of clerical script was proto-clerical script, which in turn evolved out of the little-known ''vulgar'' or ''popular'' writing of the late Warring States to Qin period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Qiu Xigui]] ''Chinese Writing'' (2000). Translation of {{lang|zh|文字學概要}} by Gilbert L. Mattos and [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]]. Early China Special Monograph Series No. 4. Berkeley: The Society for the Study of  Early China and the Institute of East Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley. {{ISBN|1-55729-071-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known character [[dictionary]] was the 3rd century BC ''[[Erya]]'', collated and bibliographed by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] and his son [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]]. It is no longer extant. Not long after, the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' (AD 100&amp;ndash;121), the lifework of [[Xu Shen]], was written. Its 9,353 entries reproduce the standardized small-seal script variant for each entry, and for some entries other pre-Han variants from the late Zhou era. Entries are categorized under 540 [[Radical (Chinese character)|section headers]].

==Computer encoding==
It has been anticipated that the small seal script will some day be encoded in [[Unicode]]. Codepoints U+31400 to U+33D1F (Plane 3, Tertiary Ideographic Plane) have been tentatively allocated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/tip/ The Unicode Consortium, Roadmap to the TIP]&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
[[File:Briefoeffner mit kuvert und hand fcm.jpg|thumb|Someone opening a letter before it has been delivered commits a crime]]
The '''secrecy of correspondence''' ({{lang-de|Briefgeheimnis}}, {{lang-fr|secret de la correspondance}}) or literally translated as '''secrecy of letters''', is a fundamental [[legal principle]] enshrined in the [[constitution]]s of several European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Legal Protection of the Secrecy of Correspondence |author=Roxana Maria |journal=Curentul ”Juridic” |year=2009 |number=1 |location=Tîrgu-Mureş, România |url=http://revcurentjur.ro/arhiva/attachments_200901/recjurid091_10F.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=1936 Constitution of the USSR |chapter=Chapter X, Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens, Article 128 |url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/36cons04.html#chap10 |quote=The inviolability of the homes of citizens and privacy of correspondence are protected by law.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Fortsakis |page=228 |publisher=Kluwer Law International |year=2009 |isbn=9789041128782 |url=https://books.google.fi/books?id=fJS-Ly83TpMC&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;dq=Secrecy%20of%20letters%20and%20all%20other%20forms%20of%20free%20correspondence%20or%20%20communication%20shall%20be%20absolutely%20inviolable&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Right to Privacy of Correspondence of Other Countries (section: Greece) |date=June 15, 2013 |author=DAVID JOHN MAROTTA |url=http://www.marottaonmoney.com/right-to-privacy-of-correspondence-of-other-countries/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It guarantees that the content of sealed [[Letter (message)|letters]] is never revealed and letters in transit are not opened by [[government]] officials or any other third party. It is thus the main legal basis for the assumption of '''privacy of correspondence'''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The principle has been naturally extended to other forms of [[telecommunication|communication]], including [[telephony]] and [[electronic communication]]s on the [[Internet]] as the constitutional guarantees are generally thought to cover also these forms of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Constitution to extend protection to e-mails |date=11 July 2014 |publisher=Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations - Government of the Netherlands |url=http://www.government.nl/ministries/bzk/news/2014/07/16/constitution-to-extend-protection-to-e-mails.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, national telecommunications privacy laws may allow [[lawful interception]], i.e. [[wiretapping]] and monitoring of electronic communications in cases of [[Suspect|suspicion of crime]]. Paper letters have in most jurisdictions remained outside the legal scope of law enforcement [[surveillance]], even in cases of ''"reasonable searches and seizures"''.

When applied to electronic communication, the principle protects not only the content of the communication, but also the information on when and to whom any messages (if any) have been sent (see: [[Call detail record]]s), and in the case of [[Mobile phone|mobile communication]], the [[location information]] of the mobile units. As a consequence, in jurisdictions with a safeguard on secrecy of letters, location data collected from mobile phone networks has a higher level of protection than data collected by [[vehicle telematics]] or transport tickets.

==United States==
{{See also|Third-party doctrine}}
In the [[United States]] there is no specific constitutional guarantee on the privacy of correspondence. The secrecy of letters and correspondence is derived through [[litigation]] from the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. In an 1877 case the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No law of [[United States Congress|Congress]] can place in the hands of officials connected with the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] any authority to invade the '''secrecy of letters''' and such sealed packages in the mail; and all regulations adopted as to mail matter of this kind must be in subordination to the great principle embodied in the fourth amendment of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Jackson'', {{ussc| source=f |96|727|1877| pin=733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The protection of the Fourth Amendment has been extended beyond the home in other instances. A protection similar to that of correspondence has [[California v. Greenwood|even been argued]] to extend to the contents of [[trash can]]s outside one's house, although unsuccessfully. Like all rights derived through litigation, the secrecy of correspondence is subject to interpretations.  By Supreme Court precedent, rights derived from the Fourth Amendment are limited by the legal test of a "[[reasonable expectation of privacy]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3477">'''Self-executing rights''' in [[international human rights law]] are rights that are formulated in such a way that one can deduce that it was the purpose to create international laws that citizens can invoke directly in their national courts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pieter Kooijmans]], Internationaal publiekrecht in vogelvlucht, Wolters-Noordhoff, Groningen, 1994, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-executing rights, or directly applicable rights, are rights which, from the viewpoint of [[international law]], do not require transformation into national law. They are binding as such and national judges can apply them as such, as if they were national rules. From the viewpoint of national law, it may be required that all international law be incorporated into national law before becoming valid. This depends on the national legal tradition.

In order to decide whether a rule is self-executing or not, one must only look at the rule in question. National traditions do not count. A rule that says that states should guarantee [[freedom of expression]] to its citizens is self-executing.{{fact|date=January 2015}} A rule that says that states should take all the necessary measures to create enough [[employment]] is not.{{fact|date=January 2015}} Non-self-executing rules of international law only impose the obligation on states to take measures and to create or alter legislation. Citizens or national judges cannot invoke these rules (and demand employment as in the previous example) in a national court. This means that international law that is not self-executing must be transformed into national law in order to take effect.

The priority of international law remains a fact whether this law is or is not self-executing. A state cannot invoke its national law as a reason not to respect its international obligations. In case of non-self-executing rules, it is obliged to change its national law or to take certain measures. It violates international law if it does not do so.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he general principle of international law is that a state cannot plead a rule or a gap in its own municipal law as a defence to a claim based on international law", M. Akehurst, A Modern Introduction to International Law, London: Harper Collins, 1991, p. 43. "The fact that a conflicting domestic provision is contained in the national constitution does not absolve the State Party concerned from international responsibility", A. Rosas, in D. Beetham, Politics and Human Rights, Oxford: Blackwell, 1995, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, a national judge can only decide that their state should modify national law or take certain measures. They cannot invalidate national law that contradicts non-self-executing international law. They can only declare national law null and void if it contradicts self-executing international rights.

Most human rights contained in the main human rights treaties are self-executing and can be invoked by individuals in a national courtroom,&lt;ref&gt;Art. 1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECPHR) states that "The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention", which means that the rights are self-executing and do not need further legal transformation.&lt;/ref&gt; although this is the case more for civil rights than for economic and social rights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4548">'''Shape theory''' is a branch of [[topology]], which provides a more global view of the topological spaces than [[homotopy theory]]. The two coincide on compacta dominated homotopically by finite polyhedra. Shape theory associates with the Čech homology theory while homotopy theory associates with the singular homology theory.

==Background==

Shape theory was reinvented, further developed and promoted by the Polish mathematician [[Karol Borsuk]] in 1968. Actually, the name ''shape theory'' was coined by Borsuk.

===Warsaw Circle===

Borsuk lived and worked in [[Warsaw]], hence the name of one of the fundamental examples of the area, the Warsaw circle. This is a compact subset of the plane produced by "closing up" a [[topologist's sine curve]] with an arc.
[[File:Warsaw Circle.png|thumb|The Warsaw Circle.]]  It has [[homotopy group]]s [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to those of a point, but is not [[homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]] to a point—instead, the Warsaw circle is shape-equivalent to a circle (one dimensional sphere).

==Development==

Borsuk's shape theory was generalized onto arbitrary (non-metric) compact spaces, and even onto general categories, by Włodzimierz Holsztyński in year 1968/1969, and published in Fund. Math. '''70''' , 157-168, y.1971 (see Jean-Marc Cordier, Tim Porter, (1989) below). This was done in a ''continuous style'', characteristic for the Čech homology rendered by [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and Norman Steenrod in their monograph ''Foundations of Algebraic Topology''. Due to the circumstance{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}, Holsztyński's paper was hardly noticed, and instead a great popularity in the field was gained by a much less advanced (more naive) paper by [[Sibe Mardešić]] and Jack Segal, which was published a little later, Fund. Math. '''72''', 61-68, y.1971. Further developments are reflected by the references below, and by their contents.

For some purposes, like dynamical systems, more sophisticated invariants were developed under the name '''strong shape'''. Generalizations to [[noncommutative geometry]], e.g. the shape theory for [[operator algebra]]s have been found.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9567">'''Social disruption''' is a term used in [[sociology]] to describe the alteration, dysfunction or breakdown of [[social relation|social life]], often in a community setting. Social disruption implies a  radical transformation, in which the old certainties of modern society are falling away and something quite new is emerging.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/921994898|title=The metamorphosis of the world|last=1944-2015,|first=Beck, Ulrich,|isbn=9780745690216|location=Cambridge|oclc=921994898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social disruption might be caused through natural disasters, massive human displacements, rapid economic, technological and demographic change but also due to controversial policy-making.

Social disruptions are for example rising sea levels that are creating new landscapes, drawing new world maps whose key lines are not traditional boundaries between nation-states but elevations above sea level. On the local level, an example would be the closing of a community grocery store, which might cause social disruption in a [[community]] by removing a "meeting ground" for community members to develop [[interpersonal relationships]] and community [[social solidarity|solidarity]].

== Results of social disruption ==
''"We are wandering aimlessly and dispassionately, arguing for and against, but the one statement on which we are, beyond all differences and over many continents, to be able to agree on, is: "I can no longer understand the world''".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Social disruptions often lead to five social symptoms: [[Frustration]], Democratic Disconnection, [[Fragmentation (sociology)|Fragmentation]], [[Polarization (politics)|Polarization]] and [[Conflict escalation|Escalation]]. Studies from the last decade show, that our societies have become more fragmented and less coherent (e.g. Bishop 2008), neighbourhoods turning into little states, organizing themselves to defend the local politics and culture against outsiders (Walzer 1983; Bauman 2017) and increasingly identifying through ways of voting, lifestyle or wellbeing (e.g. Schäfer 2015). Especially people on the more right and left political spectrum are more likely to say it is important to them to live in a place where most people share their political views and have similar interests (Pew 2014). Hence, citizens become alienated from democratic [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] (Foa and Munk 2016; Levitsky and Ziblatt 2018) and tend to assume that their opponents believe more extreme things than they really do (Iyengar et al. 2012). Moreover, fear of being identified as unqualified, denied value and dignity and for that reason marginalized, excluded or outcast, is giving rise to a widespread disenchantment with the idea that the future will improve the human condition and a mistrust in the ability of nation-states to make this happen (Pew 2015; Bauman 2017). At the same time, accelerations in liberal progression, [[globalization]] and migration flows have led to increasing polarized contestations about national identities - a volatile and critical social state, prone to conflict escalation (e.g. hate crimes after [[Brexit]] vote, incident at [[Unite the Right rally|far-right rally]] in Charlottesville, USA).

== Policy making ==
''„It is unclear how to achieve policy changes of any kind in a polarized society that has few shared facts and whose civic muscles are atrophying.“'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/17/the-three-crises-of-liberal-democracy|title=The three crises of liberal democracy {{!}} Ganesh Sitaraman|last=Sitaraman|first=Ganesh|date=2018-03-17|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International but also local challenges force our societies to find solutions and make decisions on controversial issues in an accelerated manner. The complexity of such decisions is not only mirrored in the aim to tackle a multi-causality of root causes, it also faces a high degree of uncertainty as regard to its impact. Hence, due to the growing separation between the world of [[public opinion]] on the one hand, and the world of [[problem solving]] on the other (Mair 2009), it is very likely that political decisions further polarize our societies. The explanation is that citizens evaluate disruptive developments and related policy changes on a two-way level, on the personal interests and comfort, as well on its perceived impact on their social identity and community (Ryan and Deci 2000; Haidt 2012). If a policy change reflects the substantive representation of the median voter, is something that just does not matter to citizens in regard to their [[Social acceptance|acceptance]] of decisions (Esaiasson et al. 2017). This can produce multi facet conflicts over interests, facts and norms between supporters and opponents (Itten 2017). Simultaneously, the capacity of [[political parties]] and actors of [[civil society]], to bridge that divide, is declining (Mair 2009). In such a situations, social psychology tells us that citizens who feel uncomfortable will hold tighter to the assumptions that make them feel secure (Podziba 2014). Especially in [[public policy]] disputes, parties are hardly giving up their assumptions voluntarily, and citizens begin to masquerade their true individual conflict of interest (e.g. devaluation of property; insecurity) with more normative conflict of interest (e.g. protection of nature; protection of culture). Such distorted behaviour remarkably increases at times citizens or communities feel that a policy change is threatening their way of living.

== Bridging social capital ==
In the light of the increasing social divisions and democratic disconnection, Putnam and Feldstein (2004) foresaw the importance of creating “bridging [[social capital]]”, e.g. ties that link groups across a greater social distance. As the authors elaborate, the creation of robust social capital takes time and effort. It develops largely through extensive and time-consuming face-to-face conversation between two individuals or small groups of people. Only then there is the chance to build the trust and mutual understanding that characterizes the foundation of social capital. In no way, Putnam and Feldstein write, it is possible to create social capital instantaneous, anonymous or en masse. Furthermore, building social capital among people who already share a reservoir of similar cultural referents, ethnicity, personal experience or moral identity etc. is qualitatively different. Homogeneity makes connective strategies easier, however, a society with only homogenous social capital risks looking like Bosnia or Belfast. Hence, bridging social capital is especially important for reconciling democracy and diversity. Yet, bridging social capital among diverse social group is intrinsically less likely to develop automatically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2152">The '''Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior''' was founded in 1957 by a group of researchers in the field of [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=John A.

Ronning |title=Historical Foundations of Educational Psychology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0LYACAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147 |date=11 November 2013 |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=978-1-4899-3620-2 |pages=147–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes the ''[[Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]]''.

The Certificate of Incorporation (dated October 29, 1957) of the society states that:

{{quotation|The purpose and objects of this corporation shall be to encourage, foster, and promote the advancement of the science of experimental analysis of behavior; the promotion of research in the said science and the increase and diffusion of knowledge of the said science by the conduct of a program of education by meetings, conferences and symposia, and by the publication of journals, papers, periodicals and reports.}}

The ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'' was established to meet the needs of those who were attracted to the behavior-analytic approach but were unhappy with the lack of a journal specializing in that rapidly growing area. As described on its inside front page ever since, the journal is "primarily for the original publication of experiments relevant to the behavior of individual organisms." It started as a quarterly in 1958 but has appeared bimonthly since 1964. The initial [[Editorial board|Board of Editors]] also served as the first Board of Directors of the society.

In 1968, the society established the ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'' for "the original publication of reports of experimental research involving applications of the experimental analysis of behavior to problems of social importance." It appears quarterly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9422">[[File:Quesnay Tableau.jpg|thumb|240px|Illustration of the original visualisation of the Tableau by [[François Quesnay|Quesnay]], 1759.]] 
The '''Tableau économique''' ({{IPA-fr|tablo ekɔnɔmik}}) or ''Economic Table'' is an economic model first described by French economist [[François Quesnay]] in 1758, which laid the foundation of the [[Physiocrats|Physiocratic]] school of economics.&lt;ref name="Spiegel 1983 p.189"&gt;Henry William Spiegel (1983) ''The Growth of Economic Thought'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Duke University Press. p.189&lt;/ref&gt;

Quesnay believed that trade and industry were not sources of wealth, and instead in his 1758 manuscript ''Tableau économique'' (Economic Table) argued that agricultural surpluses, by flowing through the economy in the form of rent, wages, and purchases were the real economic movers.
== The model ==
The model Quesnay created consisted of three economic movers. The "Proprietary" class consisted of only landowners. The "Productive" class consisted of all agricultural laborers. The "Sterile" class is made up of artisans and merchants. The flow of production and/or cash between the three classes started with the Proprietary class because they own the land and they buy from both of the other classes. The process has these steps (consult Figure 1).

#The farmer produces 1,500 food on land leased from the landlord. Of that 1,500, he retains 600 food to feed himself, his livestock, and any laborers he hires. He sells the remaining 900 in the market for $1 per unit of food. He keeps $300 ($150 for himself, $150 for his laborer) to buy non-farm goods (clothes, household goods, etc.) from the merchants and artisans. This produces $600 of net profit, to which Quesnay refers as ''product net''.&lt;ref name="Spiegel 1983 p.189"/&gt;
#The artisan produces 750 units of crafts. To produce at that level, he needs 300 units of food and 150 units of foreign goods. He also has subsistence need of 150 units of food and 150 units of crafts to keep himself alive during the year. The total is 450 units of food, 150 units of crafts, and 150 units of foreign goods. He buys $450 of food from the farmer and $150 of goods from the merchant, and he sells 600 units of crafts at the market for $600. Because the artisan must use the cash he made selling his crafts to buy raw materials for the next year’s production, he has no net profit.
#The landlord is only a consumer of food and crafts and produces no product. His contribution to the production process is the redistribution of $600 in [[economic rent#Land rent|land rent]] the farmer pays for the use of naturally occurring land.  The landlord uses $300 of the rent to buy food from the farmer in the market and $300 to buy crafts from the artisan. Because he is purely a consumer, Quesnay considers the landlord the prime mover of economic activity. It is his desire to consume which causes him to expend his entire lease income on food and crafts and which provides income to the other classes.
#The merchant is the mechanism for exporting food in exchange for foreign imports. The merchant uses the $150 he received from the artisan to buy food from the market, and it is assumed that he takes the food out of the country to exchange it for more foreign goods.

:'''Figure 1 Production Flow Diagram for Quesnay's Tableau (4)'''

The Tableau shows the reason why the Physiocrats disagreed with Cantillon about exporting food. The economy produces a surplus of food, and neither the farmer nor the artisan can afford to consume more than a subsistence level of food. The landlord is assumed to be consuming at a level of satiation; therefore, he cannot consume any more. Since food cannot be stored easily, it is necessary to sell it to someone who can use it. This is where the merchant provides value.

== Physiocratic interpretation ==
The merchant is not a source of wealth, however. The [[Physiocrats]] believed that “neither industry nor commerce generates wealth.”&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.858"&gt;Charbit and Virmani (2002) p.858&lt;/ref&gt; A “plausible explanation is that the Physiocrats developed their theory in light of the actual situation of the French economy…”&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.858"/&gt; France was an absolute monarchy with the land owners constituting 6-8% of the population and owning 50% of the land. (5, p.&amp;nbsp;859) Agriculture contributes 80% of the country’s wealth,&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.858"/&gt; and the non-land owning segment of the population “practises a subsistence agriculture that produces the essential minimum, with virtually all income being absorbed by food requirements.”&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.859"&gt;Charbit and Virmani (2002) p.859&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, exports consisted mostly of agricultural-based products, e.g. wine.&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.859"/&gt; Given the massive effect of agriculture on France’s economy, it was more likely they would develop an economic model that used it to the king’s advantage.

The Physiocrats are at the beginning of the anti-mercantilist movement. Quesnay’s argument against industry and international trade as alternatives to his doctrine is twofold. First, industry produces no gain in wealth; therefore, redirecting labor from agriculture to industry will in effect decrease the nation’s overall wealth. Additionally, population expands to fill available land and food supply; therefore, population must go down if the use of land does not produce food. Second, the basic premise of the Mercantilists is that a country must export more than it imports to gain wealth, but that assumes it has more of a tradeable resource than it needs for internal consumption. France did not have a colony with the ability to produce finished or semi-finished goods like England (e.g. India) or Holland (e.g. North America, Africa, South America). Its main colonial presence was in the Caribbean, southern North America, and southeast Asia, and like France, the colonies had agricultural-based economies. The only good which France had in enough excess to export was food; therefore, international trade based on industrial production would not yield as much wealth.

Quesnay was not anti-industry, however. He was just realistic in his assessment that France was not in good position to incubate a strong industrial market. His argument was that artisans and manufacturers would come to France only in proportion to the size of the internal market for their goods.&lt;ref name="Mueller 1978 p.153"&gt;Mueller (1978) p.153&lt;/ref&gt; Quesnay believed “a country should concentrate on manufacturing only to the extent that the local availability of raw materials and suitable labor enabled it to have a cost advantage over its overseas competitors.”&lt;ref name="Mueller 1978 p.153"/&gt; Anything above that amount should be purchased through trade.

== Legacy ==
The tableau économique is credited as the "first precise formulation" of interdependent systems in economics and the origin of the theory of the [[multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] in economics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YAIeAAAAIAAJ The multiplier theory], by Hugo Hegeland, 1954, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YAIeAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%2B%22tableau+economique%22&amp;pgis=1#search_anchor p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; An analogous table is used in the theory of [[money creation]] under [[fractional-reserve banking]] by relending of deposits, leading to the [[money multiplier]].

The [[wage-fund doctrine]] was derived from the tableau, then later rejected.

[[Adolph Malan|Adolph Gysbert Malan]] DSO &amp; Bar DFC (24 March 1910 – 17 September 1963), better known as Sailor Malan, was a [[South African]] [[World War II]] [[fighter pilot]] who led No. 74 Squadron RAF during the height of the Battle of Britain. Malan developed a set of simple rules for fighter pilots, which eventually could be found throughout [[RAF Fighter Command]]:

"TEN OF MY RULES FOR AIR FIGHTING"

# Wait until you see the whites of his eyes. Fire short bursts of 1 to 2 seconds and only when your sights are definitely 'ON'.
# Whilst shooting think of nothing else, brace the whole of the body, have both hands on the stick, concentrate on your ring sight.
# Always keep a sharp lookout. "Keep your finger out!"
# Height gives You the initiative.
# Always turn and face the attack.
# Make your decisions promptly. It is better to act quickly even though your tactics are not the best.
# Never fly straight and level for more than 30 seconds in the combat area.
# When diving to attack always leave a proportion of your formation above to act as top guard.
# INITIATIVE, AGGRESSION, AIR DISCIPLINE, and TEAM WORK are the words that MEAN something in Air Fighting.
# Go in quickly - Punch hard - Get out!

'''The Three Laws of Robotics''' (often shortened to '''The Three Laws''' or known as '''Asimov's Laws''') are a set of rules devised by the [[science fiction]] author [[Isaac Asimov]]. The rules were introduced in his 1942 short story "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]" (included in the 1950 collection ''[[I, Robot]]''), although they had been foreshadowed in a few earlier stories. The Three Laws, quoted as being from the "Handbook of Robotics, 56th Edition, 2058 A.D.", are:
# '''First Law''' - A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
# '''Second Law''' - A robot must obey the orders &lt;!-- Do not add "to" here: it's not in the source. --&gt;{{sic|given it|expected=given to it|hide=y}}&lt;!-- Do not add "to" here: it's not in the source. --&gt; by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
# '''Third Law''' - A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.&lt;ref name=IROBOT &gt;{{cite book |last1=Asimov |first1=Isaac |title=I, Robot |date=1950 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York City |isbn=0-385-42304-7 |page=40 |edition=The Isaac Asimov Collection |language=English |format=hardcover |chapter=Runaround |quote=This is an ''exact'' transcription of the laws. They also appear in the front of the book, and in both places there is ''no'' "to" in the 2nd law.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These form an organizing principle and unifying theme for Asimov's [[robot]]ic-based fiction, appearing in his [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]], the stories linked to it, and his [[Lucky Starr series|''Lucky Starr'' series]] of [[young adult literature|young-adult fiction]]. The Laws are incorporated into almost all of the [[positronic brain|positronic robots]] appearing in his fiction, and cannot be bypassed, being intended as a safety feature. Many of Asimov's robot-focused stories involve robots behaving in unusual and counter-intuitive ways as an unintended consequence of how the robot applies the Three Laws to the situation in which it finds itself. Other authors working in Asimov's fictional universe have adopted them and references, often [[parody|parodic]], appear throughout science fiction as well as in other genres.

The original laws have been altered and elaborated on by Asimov and other authors. Asimov himself made slight modifications to the first three in various books and short stories to further develop how robots would interact with humans and each other. In later fiction where robots had taken responsibility for government of whole planets and human civilizations, Asimov also added a fourth, or zeroth law, to precede the others:

# &lt;li value="0"&gt;A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.

The Three Laws, and the zeroth, have pervaded science fiction and are referred to in many books, films, and other media, and have impacted thought on [[ethics of artificial intelligence]] as well.

==History==
In ''The Rest of the Robots'', published in 1964, Asimov noted that when he began writing in 1940 he felt that "one of the stock plots of science fiction was&amp;nbsp;... robots were created and destroyed their creator. Knowledge has its dangers, yes, but is the response to be a retreat from knowledge? Or is knowledge to be used as itself a barrier to the dangers it brings?" He decided that in his stories robots would not "turn stupidly on his creator for no purpose but to demonstrate, for one more weary time, the crime and punishment of [[Faust]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Rest of the Robots| publisher=Doubleday| year=1964| isbn=0-385-09041-2| chapter=Introduction| author=Isaac Asimov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 1939, Asimov attended a meeting of the [[Queens]] ([[New York (state)|New York]]) Science Fiction Society where he met [[Eando Binder|Earl and Otto Binder]] who had recently published a short story [[I, Robot (short story)|"I, Robot"]] featuring a sympathetic robot named [[Adam Link]] who was misunderstood and motivated by love and honor. (This was the first of a series of ten stories; the next year "Adam Link's Vengeance" (1940) featured Adam thinking "A robot must never kill a human, of his own free will.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink=James Gunn (author)| last=Gunn| first=James| title=On Variations on a Robot| journal=[[Asimov's Science Fiction|IASFM]] |date=July 1980| pages=56–81}} Reprinted in {{cite book| title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction| year=1982| isbn=0-19-503060-5| author=James Gunn.| publisher=Oxford Univ. Pr.| location=Oxford u.a.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov admired the story. Three days later Asimov began writing "my own story of a sympathetic and noble robot", his 14th story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=In Memory Yet Green| publisher=Doubleday| year=1979| first=Isaac| last=Asimov| isbn=0-380-75432-0| page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen days later he took "[[Robbie (short story)|Robbie]]" to [[John W. Campbell]] the editor of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]''. Campbell rejected it, claiming that it bore too strong a resemblance to [[Lester del Rey]]'s "[[Helen O'Loy]]", published in December 1938; the story of a robot that is so much like a person that she falls in love with her creator and becomes his ideal wife.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), pp.236–8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederik Pohl]] published "Robbie" in ''[[Astonishing Stories]]'' magazine the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov attributes the Three Laws to John W. Campbell, from a conversation that took place on 23 December 1940. Campbell claimed that Asimov had the Three Laws already in his mind and that they simply needed to be stated explicitly. Several years later Asimov's friend [[Randall Garrett]] attributed the Laws to a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] partnership between the two men&amp;nbsp;– a suggestion that Asimov adopted enthusiastically.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), pp. 285–7.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his autobiographical writings, Asimov included the First Law's "inaction" clause because of [[Arthur Hugh Clough]]'s poem "[[The Latest Decalogue]]", which includes the satirical lines "Thou shalt not kill, but needst not strive / officiously to keep alive".&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac (1979). In Memory Yet Green. Doubleday. Chapters 21 through 26 {{ISBN|0-380-75432-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Asimov pins the creation of the Three Laws on one particular date, their appearance in his literature happened over a period. He wrote two robot stories with no explicit mention of the Laws, "[[Robbie (short story)|Robbie]]" and "[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]". He assumed, however, that robots would have certain inherent safeguards. "[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]", his third robot story, makes the first mention of the First Law but not the other two. All three laws finally appeared together in "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]". When these stories and several others were compiled in the anthology ''[[I, Robot]]'', "Reason" and "Robbie" were updated to acknowledge all the Three Laws, though the material Asimov added to "Reason" is not entirely consistent with the Three Laws as he described them elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Patrouch| first=Joseph F.| title=The Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov| publisher=Doubleday| year=1974| isbn=0-385-08696-2| page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the idea of a robot protecting human lives when it does not believe those humans truly exist is at odds with Elijah Baley's reasoning, as described [[#Ambiguities and loopholes|below]].

During the 1950s Asimov wrote a series of science fiction novels expressly intended for young-adult audiences. Originally his publisher expected that the novels could be adapted into a long-running television series, something like ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' had been for radio. Fearing that his stories would be adapted into the "uniformly awful" programming he saw flooding the television channels&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov decided to publish the [[Lucky Starr series|''Lucky Starr'']] books under the [[pseudonym]] "Paul French". When plans for the television series fell through, Asimov decided to abandon the pretence; he brought the Three Laws into ''Lucky Starr and the Moons of Jupiter'', noting that this "was a dead giveaway to Paul French's identity for even the most casual reader".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=In Joy Still Felt| publisher=Doubleday| year=1980| isbn=0-385-15544-1| last= Asimov| first=Isaac| page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his short story [[Evidence (Asimov)|"Evidence"]] Asimov lets his recurring character [[Susan Calvin|Dr. Susan Calvin]] expound a [[morality|moral]] basis behind the Three Laws. Calvin points out that human beings are typically expected to refrain from harming other human beings (except in times of extreme duress like war, or to save a greater number) and this is equivalent to a robot's First Law. Likewise, according to Calvin, society expects individuals to obey instructions from recognized authorities such as doctors, teachers and so forth which equals the Second Law of Robotics. Finally humans are typically expected to avoid harming themselves which is the Third Law for a robot.

The plot of "Evidence" revolves around the question of telling a human being apart from a robot constructed to appear human&amp;nbsp;– Calvin reasons that if such an individual obeys the Three Laws he may be a robot or simply "a very good man". Another character then asks Calvin if robots are very different from human beings after all. She replies, "Worlds different. Robots are essentially decent."

Asimov later wrote that he should not be praised for creating the Laws, because they are "obvious from the start, and everyone is aware of them subliminally. The Laws just never happened to be put into brief sentences until I managed to do the job. The Laws apply, as a matter of course, to every tool that human beings use",&lt;ref name="asimov198111"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/1981-11-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_018_1981_Nov#page/n19/mode/2up |title=The Three Laws |work=Compute! |date=November 1981 |accessdate=26 October 2013 |author=Asimov, Isaac |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "analogues of the Laws are implicit in the design of almost all tools, robotic or not":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Asimov |first=Isaac |title= Robot Visions|date= 12 April 2001|publisher= Gollancz|isbn= 978-1-85798-336-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Law 1: A tool must not be unsafe to use. [[Hammer]]s have handles and [[screwdriver]]s have hilts to help increase grip. It is of course possible for a person to injure himself with one of these tools, but that injury would only be due to his incompetence, not the design of the tool.
# Law 2: A tool must perform its function efficiently unless this would harm the user. This is the entire reason [[ground-fault circuit interrupter]]s exist. Any running tool will have its power cut if a circuit senses that some current is not returning to the neutral wire, and hence might be flowing through the user. The safety of the user is paramount.
# Law 3: A tool must remain intact during its use unless its destruction is required for its use or for safety. For example, [[Dremel]] disks are designed to be as tough as possible without breaking unless the job requires it to be spent. Furthermore, they are designed to break at a point before the shrapnel velocity could seriously injure someone (other than the eyes, though safety glasses should be worn at all times anyway).

Asimov believed that, ideally, humans would also follow the Laws:{{r|asimov198111}}

{{quote|I have my answer ready whenever someone asks me if I think that my Three Laws of Robotics will actually be used to govern the behavior of robots, once they become versatile and flexible enough to be able to choose among different courses of behavior.

My answer is, "Yes, the Three Laws are the only way in which rational human beings can deal with robots—or with anything else."

—But when I say that, I always remember (sadly) that human beings are not always rational.}}

==Alterations==

===By Asimov===
Asimov's stories test his Three Laws in a wide variety of circumstances leading to proposals and rejection of modifications. Science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]] writes in 1982, "The Asimov robot stories as a whole may respond best to an analysis on this basis: the ambiguity in the Three Laws and the ways in which Asimov played twenty-nine variations upon a theme".&lt;ref&gt;Gunn (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; While the original set of Laws provided inspirations for many stories, Asimov introduced modified versions from time to time.

====First Law modified====
In "[[Little Lost Robot]]" several NS-2, or "Nestor", robots are created with only part of the First Law.&lt;ref name="IROBOT"/&gt; It reads:

{{quote|1. A robot may not harm a human being.}}

This modification is motivated by a practical difficulty as robots have to work alongside human beings who are exposed to low doses of radiation. Because their [[positronic brain]]s are highly sensitive to [[gamma ray]]s the robots are rendered inoperable by doses reasonably safe for humans. The robots are being destroyed attempting to rescue the humans who are in no actual danger but "might forget to leave" the irradiated area within the exposure time limit. Removing the First Law's "inaction" clause solves this problem but creates the possibility of an even greater one: a robot could initiate an action that would harm a human (dropping a heavy weight and failing to catch it is the example given in the text), knowing that it was capable of preventing the harm and then decide not to do so.&lt;ref name="IROBOT"/&gt;

[[Gaia (Foundation universe)|Gaia]] is a planet with [[collective intelligence]] in the [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] which adopts a law similar to the First Law, and the Zeroth Law, as its philosophy:

{{quote|Gaia may not harm life or allow life to come to harm.}}

====Zeroth Law added====
Asimov once added a "[[Zero-based numbering|Zeroth]] Law"—so named to continue the pattern where lower-numbered laws supersede the higher-numbered laws—stating that a robot must not harm humanity. The robotic character [[R. Daneel Olivaw]] was the first to give the Zeroth Law a name in the novel ''[[Robots and Empire]]'';&lt;ref name="BBCAsimov"&gt;{{cite web |title=Isaac Asimov |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A42253922 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the character Susan Calvin articulates the concept in the short story "[[The Evitable Conflict]]".

In the final scenes of the novel ''Robots and Empire'', [[R. Giskard Reventlov]] is the first robot to act according to the Zeroth Law. Giskard is [[telepathic]], like the robot Herbie in the short story "[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]", and tries to apply the Zeroth Law through his understanding of a more subtle concept of "harm" than most robots can grasp.&lt;ref name="SC1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2007/07/05/autprofile.htm |work=Campus Star |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |date=29 July 2007 |accessdate=7 August 2016 |quote=Only highly advanced robots (such as Daneel and Giskard) could comprehend this law.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Herbie, Giskard grasps the philosophical concept of the Zeroth Law allowing him to harm individual human beings if he can do so in service to the abstract concept of humanity. The Zeroth Law is never programmed into Giskard's brain but instead is a rule he attempts to comprehend through pure [[metacognition]]. Though he fails – it ultimately destroys his positronic brain as he is not certain whether his choice will turn out to be for the ultimate good of humanity or not – he gives his successor R. Daneel Olivaw his telepathic abilities. Over the course of many thousands of years Daneel adapts himself to be able to fully obey the Zeroth Law. As Daneel formulates it, in the novels ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' and ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'', the Zeroth Law reads:

{{quote|A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.}}

A condition stating that the Zeroth Law must not be broken was added to the original Three Laws, although Asimov recognized the difficulty such a law would pose in practice. Asimov's novel ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' contains the following passage:

{{bquote|
Trevize frowned. "How do you decide what is injurious, or not injurious, to humanity as a whole?"

"Precisely, sir," said Daneel. "In theory, the Zeroth Law was the answer to our problems. In practice, we could never decide. A human being is a concrete object. Injury to a person can be estimated and judged. Humanity is an abstraction."}}

A translator incorporated the concept of the Zeroth Law into one of Asimov's novels before Asimov himself made the law explicit.&lt;ref name="Brécard" /&gt; Near the climax of ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', [[Elijah Baley]] makes a bitter comment to himself thinking that the First Law forbids a robot from harming a human being. He determines that it must be so unless the robot is clever enough to comprehend that its actions are for humankind's long-term good. In Jacques Brécard's 1956 [[French language|French]] translation entitled ''[[:fr:Les Cavernes d'acier|Les Cavernes d'acier]]'' Baley's thoughts emerge in a slightly different way:

{{quote|A robot may not harm a human being, unless he finds a way to prove that ultimately the harm done would benefit humanity in general!&lt;ref name="Brécard"&gt;{{cite book| last=Asimov| first=Isaac| title=The Caves of Steel| publisher=Doubleday| year=1952}}, translated by Jacques Brécard as {{cite book| title=[[:fr:Les Cavernes d'acier|Les Cavernes d'acier]]| publisher=J'ai Lu Science-fiction| year=1975| isbn=2-290-31902-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Removal of the Three Laws====
Three times during his writing career, Asimov portrayed robots that disregard the Three Laws entirely. The first case was a [[Vignette (literature)|short-short story]] entitled "[[First Law]]" and is often considered an insignificant "tall tale"&lt;ref&gt;Patrouch (1974), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[apocrypha]]l.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn (1980); reprinted in Gunn (1982), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the short story "[[Cal (short story)|Cal]]" (from the collection ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]''), told by a first-person robot narrator, features a robot who disregards the Three Laws because he has found something far more important—he wants to be a writer. Humorous, partly autobiographical and unusually experimental in style, "Cal" has been regarded as one of ''Gold'''s strongest stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins |first=John H. |work=Jenkins' Spoiler-Laden Guide to Isaac Asimov |url=http://preem.tejat.net/~tseng/Asimov/Stories/Story419.html |year=2002 |accessdate=2009-06-26 |title=Review of "Cal" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911085355/http://preem.tejat.net/~tseng/Asimov/Stories/Story419.html |archivedate=2009-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third is a short story entitled "[[Sally (Asimov)|Sally]]" in which cars fitted with positronic brains are apparently able to harm and kill humans in disregard of the First Law. However, aside from the positronic brain concept, this story does not refer to other robot stories and may not be set in the same [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]].

The title story of the ''[[Robot Dreams]]'' collection portrays LVX-1, or "Elvex", a robot who enters a state of unconsciousness and dreams thanks to the unusual [[fractal]] construction of his positronic brain. In his dream the first two Laws are absent and the Third Law reads "A robot must protect its own existence".&lt;ref name="RDA1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Robot Dreams |year=1986 |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |accessdate=11 November 2010 |url=http://www.tcnj.edu/~miranda/classes/topics/reading/asimov.pdf |quote=“But you quote it in incomplete fashion. The Third Law is ‘A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.’ ” “Yes, Dr. Calvin. That is the Third Law in reality, but in my dream, the Law ended with the word ‘existence’. There was no mention of the First or Second Law.” |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316134042/http://www.tcnj.edu/~miranda/classes/topics/reading/asimov.pdf |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov took varying positions on whether the Laws were optional: although in his first writings they were simply carefully engineered safeguards, in later stories Asimov stated that they were an inalienable part of the mathematical foundation underlying the positronic brain. Without the basic theory of the Three Laws the fictional scientists of Asimov's universe would be unable to design a workable brain unit. This is historically consistent: the occasions where roboticists modify the Laws generally occur early within the stories' chronology and at a time when there is less existing work to be re-done. In "Little Lost Robot" Susan Calvin considers modifying the Laws to be a terrible idea, although possible,&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite web |title='The Complete Robot' by Isaac Asimov |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A455898 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 November 2010 |date=3 November 2000 |quote=The answer is that it had had its First Law modified}}&lt;/ref&gt; while centuries later Dr. Gerrigel in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'' believes it to be impossible.

The character Dr. Gerrigel uses the term "Asenion" to describe robots programmed with the Three Laws. The robots in Asimov's stories, being Asenion robots, are incapable of knowingly violating the Three Laws but, in principle, a robot in science fiction or in the real world could be non-Asenion. "Asenion" is a misspelling of the name Asimov which was made by an editor of the magazine ''Planet Stories.''&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1979), pp. 291–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov used this obscure variation to insert himself into ''The Caves of Steel'' just like he referred to himself as "Azimuth or, possibly, Asymptote" in ''[[Thiotimoline]] to the Stars'', in much the same way that [[Vladimir Nabokov]] appeared in ''[[Lolita]]'' [[anagram]]matically disguised as "Vivian Darkbloom".

Characters within the stories often point out that the Three Laws, as they exist in a robot's mind, are not the written versions usually quoted by humans but abstract mathematical concepts upon which a robot's entire developing consciousness is based. This concept is largely fuzzy and unclear in earlier stories depicting very rudimentary robots who are only programmed to comprehend basic physical tasks, where the Three Laws act as an overarching safeguard, but by the era of ''The Caves of Steel'' featuring robots with human or beyond-human intelligence the Three Laws have become the underlying basic ethical worldview that determines the actions of all robots.

===By other authors===

====Roger MacBride Allen's trilogy====
In the 1990s, [[Roger MacBride Allen]] wrote a trilogy which was set within Asimov's fictional universe. Each title has the prefix "Isaac Asimov's" as Asimov had approved Allen's outline before his death.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} These three books, ''[[Isaac Asimov's Caliban|Caliban]]'', ''[[Isaac Asimov's Inferno|Inferno]]'' and ''[[Isaac Asimov's Utopia|Utopia]]'', introduce a new set of the Three Laws. The so-called New Laws are similar to Asimov's originals with the following differences: the First Law is modified to remove the "inaction" clause, the same modification made in "Little Lost Robot"; the Second Law is modified to require cooperation instead of obedience; the Third Law is modified so it is no longer superseded by the Second (i.e., a "New Law" robot cannot be ordered to destroy itself); finally, Allen adds a Fourth Law which instructs the robot to do "whatever it likes" so long as this does not conflict with the first three laws. The philosophy behind these changes is that "New Law" robots should be partners rather than slaves to humanity, according to [[Fredda Leving]], who designed these [[New Law Robots]]. According to the first book's introduction, Allen devised the New Laws in discussion with Asimov himself. However, the ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' says that "With permission from Asimov, Allen rethought the Three Laws and developed a new set,".&lt;ref name="EoSF1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of science fiction |year=2005 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-0-8160-5924-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icA3oLIZEeMC&amp;pg=PA7 |author=[[Don D'Ammassa]] |page=7 |chapter=Allen, Roger MacBride}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jack Williamson's "With Folded Hands"====
[[Jack Williamson]]'s novelette "[[With Folded Hands]]" (1947), later rewritten as the novel ''The Humanoids'', deals with robot servants whose prime directive is "To Serve and Obey, And Guard Men From Harm". While Asimov's robotic laws are meant to protect humans from harm, the robots in Williamson's story have taken these instructions to the extreme; they protect humans from everything, including unhappiness, stress, unhealthy lifestyle and all actions that could be potentially dangerous. All that is left for humans to do is to sit with folded hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/~engb415/literature/cyberzach/Williamson/human.html |title=The Humanoids |publisher=Umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Foundation'' sequel trilogy====
In the officially licensed ''Foundation'' sequels ''[[Foundation's Fear]]'', ''[[Foundation and Chaos]]'' and ''[[Foundation's Triumph]]'' (by [[Gregory Benford]], [[Greg Bear]] and [[David Brin]] respectively) the future [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]] is seen to be controlled by a conspiracy of humaniform robots who follow the Zeroth Law and are led by [[R. Daneel Olivaw]].

The Laws of Robotics are portrayed as something akin to a human [[religion]], and referred to in the language of the [[Protestant Reformation]], with the set of laws containing the Zeroth Law known as the "Giskardian Reformation" to the original "Calvinian Orthodoxy" of the Three Laws. Zeroth-Law robots under the control of R. Daneel Olivaw are seen continually struggling with "First Law" robots who deny the existence of the Zeroth Law, promoting agendas different from Daneel's.&lt;ref name="TMATWilkinson1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Muse as Therapist: A New Poetic Paradigm for Psychotherapy |year=2009|publisher=Karnac Books |isbn=978-1-85575-595-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjhWPnUGexQC&amp;pg=PA22 |author=Heward Wilkinson|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these agendas are based on the first clause of the First Law ("A robot may not injure a human being...") advocating strict non-interference in human politics to avoid unwittingly causing harm. Others are based on the second clause ("...or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm") claiming that robots should openly become a [[Dictatorship|dictatorial]] government to protect humans from all potential conflict or disaster.

Daneel also comes into conflict with a robot known as R. Lodovic Trema whose positronic brain was infected by a rogue [[artificial intelligence|AI]] — specifically, a simulation of the long-dead [[Voltaire]] — which consequently frees Trema from the Three Laws. Trema comes to believe that humanity should be free to choose its own future. Furthermore, a small group of robots claims that the Zeroth Law of Robotics itself implies a higher Minus One Law of Robotics:

{{quote|A robot may not harm [[sentience]] or, through inaction, allow sentience to come to harm.}}

They therefore claim that it is morally indefensible for Daneel to ruthlessly sacrifice robots and [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] sentient life for the benefit of humanity. None of these reinterpretations successfully displace Daneel's Zeroth Law — though ''Foundation's Triumph'' hints that these robotic factions remain active as fringe groups up to the time of the novel [[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|''Foundation'']].&lt;ref name="TMATWilkinson1" /&gt;

These novels take place in a future dictated by Asimov to be free of obvious robot presence and surmise that R. Daneel's secret influence on history through the millennia has prevented both the rediscovery of [[positronic brain]] technology and the opportunity to work on sophisticated intelligent machines. This lack of rediscovery and lack of opportunity makes certain that the superior physical and intellectual power wielded by intelligent machines remains squarely in the possession of robots obedient to some form of the Three Laws.&lt;ref name="TMATWilkinson1" /&gt; That R. Daneel is not entirely successful at this becomes clear in a brief period when scientists on [[Trantor]] develop "[[Trantor#Food production|''tiktoks'']]" — simplistic programmable machines akin to real–life modern robots and therefore lacking the Three Laws. The robot conspirators see the Trantorian tiktoks as a massive threat to social stability, and their plan to eliminate the tiktok threat forms much of the plot of ''Foundation's Fear''.

In ''Foundation's Triumph'' different robot factions interpret the Laws in a wide variety of ways, seemingly ringing every possible permutation upon the Three Laws' ambiguities.

====Robot Mystery series====
Set between ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'' and ''[[Robots and Empire]]'', [[Mark W. Tiedemann]]'s ''Robot Mystery'' trilogy updates the ''Robot''–''Foundation'' saga with robotic minds housed in computer mainframes rather than humanoid bodies.{{clarify|not sure of the significance of this to the article - needs explaining via a reliable source|date=June 2011}} The 2002 Aurora novel has robotic characters debating the moral implications of harming cyborg lifeforms who are part artificial and part biological.&lt;ref name="IAATiedemann1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Aurora (ebook) |publisher=Byron Press Visual Publications |author=MARK W. TIEDEMANN |page=558 |quote="In short", Bogard said, "not all people are human"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One should not neglect Asimov's own creations in these areas such as the Solarian "viewing" technology and the machines of ''[[The Evitable Conflict]]'' originals that Tiedemann acknowledges. ''Aurora'', for example, terms the Machines "the first RIs, really". In addition the ''Robot Mystery'' series addresses the problem of [[nanotechnology]]:&lt;ref name="tiedemann"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sffworld.com/interview/94p0.html| title=Interview with Mark Tiedemann| publisher=Science Fiction and Fantasy World| date=16 August 2002| accessdate = 2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; building a positronic brain capable of reproducing human cognitive processes requires a high degree of miniaturization, yet Asimov's stories largely overlook the effects this miniaturization would have in other fields of technology. For example, the police department card-readers in ''The Caves of Steel'' have a capacity of only a few kilobytes per square centimeter of storage medium. ''Aurora'', in particular, presents a sequence of historical developments which explains the lack of nanotechnology — a partial [[retcon]], in a sense, of Asimov's timeline.

====Additional laws====
There are three Fourth Laws written by authors other than Asimov. The 1974 [[Lyuben Dilov]] novel, ''Icarus's Way'' (a.k.a., ''The Trip of Icarus'') introduced a Fourth Law of robotics:

{{quote|A robot must establish its identity as a robot in all cases.}}

Dilov gives reasons for the fourth safeguard in this way: "The last Law has put an end to the expensive aberrations of designers to give psychorobots as humanlike a form as possible. And to the resulting misunderstandings..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A fifth law was introduced by [[Nikola Kesarovski]] in his short story "The Fifth Law of Robotics". This fifth law says:

{{quote|A robot must know it is a robot.}}

The plot revolves around a murder where the forensic investigation discovers that the victim was killed by a hug from a humaniform robot. The robot violated both the First Law and Dilov's Fourth Law (assumed in Kesarovksi's universe to be the valid one) because it did not establish for itself that it was a robot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

For the 1986 tribute anthology, ''[[Foundation's Friends]],'' [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] wrote a story entitled, "The Fourth Law of Robotics". This Fourth Law states:

{{quote|A robot must reproduce. As long as such reproduction does not interfere with the First or Second or Third Law.}}

In the book a robot rights activist, in an attempt to liberate robots, builds several equipped with this Fourth Law. The robots accomplish the task laid out in this version of the Fourth Law by building new robots who view their creator robots as parental figures.&lt;ref name="HHThefourthlaw1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Harry |title=The Fourth Law of Robotics |year=1989 |authorlink=Harry Harrison (writer) |pages=7–8 |quote=A robot must reproduce. As long as such reproduction does not interfere with the First or Second or Third Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the 2004 Will Smith [[I, Robot (film)|film adaptation of ''I, Robot'']], humorist and graphic designer Mark Sottilaro farcically declared the Fourth Law of Robotics to be "When turning evil, display a red indicator light." The red light indicated the wireless uplink to the manufacturer is active, first seen during a software update and later on "Evil" robots taken over by the manufacturer's positronic superbrain.

In 2013 Hutan Ashrafian, proposed an additional law that for the first time{{cn|date=March 2017}} considered the role of artificial intelligence-on-artificial intelligence or the relationship between robots themselves – the so-called AIonAI law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ashrafian |first= Hutan| year= 2014|title= AIonAI: A Humanitarian Law of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11948-013-9513-9#page-1 |journal= Science and Engineering Ethics |volume= 21 |issue= 1 |pages= 29–40 |publisher= Springer| doi= 10.1007/s11948-013-9513-9 |pmid= 24414678 |accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sixth law states:

{{quote|All robots endowed with comparable human reason and conscience should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.}}

In [[Karl Schroeder]]'s ''Lockstep'' (2014) a character reflects that robots "probably had multiple layers of programming to keep [them] from harming anybody. Not three laws, but twenty or thirty."

== Ambiguities and loopholes ==

===Unknowing breach of the laws===
In ''The Naked Sun'', [[Elijah Baley]] points out that the Laws had been deliberately misrepresented because robots could ''unknowingly'' break any of them. He restated the first law as "A robot may do nothing that, ''to its knowledge,'' will harm a human being; nor, through inaction, ''knowingly'' allow a human being to come to harm." This change in wording makes it clear that robots can become the tools of murder, provided they not be aware of the nature of their tasks; for instance being ordered to add something to a person's food, not knowing that it is poison. Furthermore, he points out that a clever criminal could divide a task among multiple robots so that no individual robot could recognize that its actions would lead to harming a human being.&lt;ref name="TNSPoison"&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=The Naked Sun (ebook)|year=1956–1957|page=233|quote=... one robot poison an arrow without knowing it was using poison, and having a second robot hand the poisoned arrow to the boy ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Naked Sun'' complicates the issue by portraying a decentralized, planetwide communication network among Solaria's millions of robots meaning that the criminal mastermind could be located anywhere on the planet.

Baley furthermore proposes that the Solarians may one day use robots for military purposes. If a spacecraft was built with a positronic brain and carried neither humans nor the life-support systems to sustain them, then the ship's robotic intelligence could naturally assume that all other spacecraft were robotic beings. Such a ship could operate more responsively and flexibly than one crewed by humans, could be armed more heavily and its robotic brain equipped to slaughter humans of whose existence it is totally ignorant.&lt;ref name="TNSSpaceship"&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=The Naked Sun (ebook)|year=1956–1957|page=240|quote=But a spaceship that was equipped with its own positronic brain would cheerfully attack any ship it was directed to attack, it seems to me. It would naturally assume all other ships were unmanned}}&lt;/ref&gt; This possibility is referenced in ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' where it is discovered that the Solarians possess a strong police force of unspecified size that has been programmed to identify only the Solarian race as human. (The novel takes place thousands of years after The Naked Sun, and the Solarians have long since modified themselves from normal humans to hermaphroditic telepaths with extended brains and specialized organs)

===Ambiguities resulting from lack of definition===
The Laws of Robotics presume that the terms "human being" and "robot" are understood and well defined. In some stories this presumption is overturned.

====Definition of "human being"====
The [[Solaria]]ns create robots with the Three Laws but with a warped meaning of "human". Solarian robots are told that only people speaking with a Solarian accent are human. This enables their robots to have no ethical dilemma in harming non-Solarian human beings (and are specifically programmed to do so). By the time period of ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' it is revealed that the Solarians have genetically modified themselves into a distinct species from humanity — becoming hermaphroditic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foundation and Earth (1986) |url=http://www.gotterdammerung.org/books/isaac-asimov/foundation-and-earth.html |publisher=gotterdammerung.org |accessdate=11 November 2010 |author=Branislav L. Slantchev}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] and containing biological organs capable of individually powering and controlling whole complexes of robots. The robots of Solaria thus respected the Three Laws only with regard to the "humans" of Solaria. It is unclear whether all the robots had such definitions, since only the overseer and guardian robots were shown explicitly to have them. In "Robots and Empire", the lower class robots were instructed by their overseer about whether certain creatures are human or not.

Asimov addresses the problem of humanoid robots ("[[android (robot)|androids]]" in later parlance) several times. The novel ''[[Robots and Empire]]'' and the short stories "[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]" and "The Tercentenary Incident" describe robots crafted to fool people into believing that the robots are human.&lt;ref name="ROBANDEMP1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Robots and Empire |publisher=Doubleday books |isbn=0-385-19092-1|authorlink=Isaac Asimov|page=151|quote=although the woman looked as human as Daneel did, she was just as nonhuman}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, "[[The Bicentennial Man]]" and "[[—That Thou Art Mindful of Him]]" explore how the robots may change their interpretation of the Laws as they grow more sophisticated. [[Gwendoline Butler]] writes in ''A Coffin for the Canary'' "Perhaps we are robots. Robots acting out the last Law of Robotics... To tend towards the human."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Butler| first=Gwendoline| title=A Coffin for the Canary| publisher=Black Dagger Crime| year=2001| isbn=0-7540-8580-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'', [[Elijah Baley]] points out that the use of humaniform robots as the first wave of settlers on new Spacer worlds may lead to the robots seeing themselves as the true humans, and deciding to keep the worlds for themselves rather than allow the Spacers to settle there.

"—That Thou Art Mindful of Him", which Asimov intended to be the "ultimate" probe into the Laws' subtleties,&lt;ref&gt;Gunn (1980); reprinted in Gunn (1982), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; finally uses the Three Laws to conjure up the very "Frankenstein" scenario they were invented to prevent. It takes as its concept the growing development of robots that mimic non-human living things and given programs that mimic simple animal behaviours which do not require the Three Laws. The presence of a whole range of robotic life that serves the same purpose as organic life ends with two humanoid robots concluding that organic life is an unnecessary requirement for a truly logical and self-consistent definition of "humanity", and that since they are the most advanced thinking beings on the planet — they are therefore the only two true humans alive and the Three Laws only apply to themselves. The story ends on a sinister note as the two robots enter hibernation and await a time when they will conquer the Earth and subjugate biological humans to themselves; an outcome they consider an inevitable result of the "Three Laws of Humanics".&lt;ref name="TCRMindful1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=The Complete Robot |year=1982 |publisher=Nightfall, Inc. |authorlink=Isaac Asimov|page=611|chapter=... That Thou Art Mindful Of Him}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This story does not fit within the overall sweep of the ''Robot'' and [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]]; if the George robots ''did'' take over Earth some time after the story closes the later stories would be either redundant or impossible. Contradictions of this sort among Asimov's fiction works have led scholars to regard the ''Robot'' stories as more like "the Scandinavian sagas or the Greek legends" than a unified whole.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn (1982), pp. 77–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, Asimov describes "–That Thou Art Mindful of Him" and "Bicentennial Man" as two opposite, parallel futures for robots that obviate the Three Laws as robots come to consider themselves to be humans: one portraying this in a positive light with a robot joining human society, one portraying this in a negative light with robots supplanting humans.&lt;ref name="TCRBicentennial"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac|title=The Complete Robot|year=1982|publisher=Nightfall, Inc. |authorlink=Isaac Asimov|page=658|chapter=The Bicentennial Man}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are to be considered alternatives to the possibility of a robot society that continues to be driven by the Three Laws as portrayed in the ''Foundation'' series.{{According to whom|date=December 2010}} Indeed, in ''Positronic Man'', the novelization of "Bicentennial Man", Asimov and his co–writer [[Robert Silverberg]] imply that in the future where Andrew Martin exists his influence causes humanity to abandon the idea of independent, sentient humanlike robots entirely, creating an utterly different future from that of ''Foundation''.{{According to whom|date=December 2010}}

In ''[[Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn]]'', a novel unrelated to the ''Robot'' series but featuring robots programmed with the Three Laws, John Bigman Jones is almost killed by a Sirian robot on orders of its master. The society of Sirius is eugenically bred to be uniformly tall and similar in appearance, and as such, said master is able to convince the robot that the much shorter Bigman, is, in fact, not a human being.

====Definition of "robot"====
As noted in "The Fifth Law of Robotics" by [[Nikola Kesarovski]], "A robot must know it is a robot": it is presumed that a robot has a definition of the term or a means to apply it to its own actions. Kesarovski played with this idea in writing about a robot that could kill a human being because it did not understand that it was a robot, and therefore did not apply the Laws of Robotics to its actions.

===Resolving conflicts among the laws===
Advanced robots in fiction are typically programmed to handle the Three Laws in a sophisticated manner. In many stories, such as "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]" by Asimov, the potential and severity of all actions are weighed and a robot will break the laws as little as possible rather than do nothing at all. For example, the First Law may forbid a robot from functioning as a surgeon, as that act may cause damage to a human, however Asimov's stories eventually included robot surgeons ("The Bicentennial Man" being a notable example). When robots are sophisticated enough to weigh alternatives, a robot may be programmed to accept the necessity of inflicting damage during surgery in order to prevent the greater harm that would result if the surgery were not carried out, or was carried out by a more fallible human surgeon. In "[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]" Susan Calvin points out that a robot may even act as a [[Attorney at law (United States)|prosecuting attorney]] because in the American justice system it is the [[jury]] which decides guilt or innocence, the judge who decides the sentence, and the [[executioner]] who carries through [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book |title=I, Robot |url=http://nullfile.com/ebooks/%28ebook%29%20Asimov,%20Isaac%20-%20I,%20Robot.pdf |author=Isaac Asimov |accessdate=11 November 2010 |page=122 |format=Asimov, Isaac - I, Robot.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov's Three Law robots (or Asenion) can experience irreversible mental collapse if they are forced into situations where they cannot obey the First Law, or if they discover they have unknowingly violated it. The first example of this [[failure mode]] occurs in the story "[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]", which introduced the First Law itself, and introduces failure by dilemma – in this case the robot will hurt them if he tells them something and hurt them if he does not.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|title=I, Robot |url=http://nullfile.com/ebooks/%28ebook%29%20Asimov,%20Isaac%20-%20I,%20Robot.pdf|author=Isaac Asimov|accessdate=11 November 2010 |page=75 |format=Asimov, Isaac - I, Robot.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This failure mode, which often ruins the positronic brain beyond repair, plays a significant role in Asimov's SF-mystery novel ''[[The Naked Sun]]''. Here Daneel describes activities contrary to one of the laws, but in support of another, as overloading some circuits in a robot's brain&amp;nbsp;– the equivalent sensation to pain in humans. The example he uses is forcefully ordering a robot to do a task outside its normal parameters, one that it has been ordered to forgo in favor of a robot specialized to that task.&lt;ref name="TNSPain"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=The Naked Sun (ebook) |year=1956–1957 |page=56 |quote=Are you trying to tell me, Daneel, that it hurts the robot to have me do its work? ... experience which the robot undergoes is as upsetting to it as pain is to a human}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'', it is stated that more advanced robots are built capable of determining which action is more harmful, and even choosing at random if the alternatives are equally bad. As such, a robot is capable of taking an action which can be interpreted as following the First Law, and avoid a mental collapse. The whole plot of the story revolves around a robot which apparently was destroyed by such a mental collapse, and since his designer and creator refused to share the basic theory with others, he is, by definition, the only person capable of circumventing the safeguards and forcing the robot into a brain-destroying paradox.

In ''[[Robots and Empire]]'', Daneel states it's very unpleasant for him when making the proper decision takes too long (in robot terms), and he cannot imagine being without the Laws at all except to the extent of it being similar to that unpleasant sensation, only permanent.

Robots and artificial intelligences do not inherently contain or obey the Three Laws; their human creators must choose to program them in, and devise a means to do so. Robots already exist (for example, a [[Roomba]]) that are too simple to understand when they are causing pain or injury and know to stop. Many are constructed with physical safeguards such as bumpers, warning beepers, safety cages, or restricted-access zones to prevent accidents. Even the most complex robots currently produced are incapable of understanding and applying the Three Laws; significant advances in artificial intelligence would be needed to do so, and even if AI could reach human-level intelligence, the inherent ethical complexity as well as cultural/contextual dependency of the laws prevent them from being a good candidate to formulate robotics design constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~prestes/Courses/Robotics/beyond%20asimov.pdf | title=Beyond Asimov: The Three Laws of Responsible Robotics | journal=IEEE Intelligent systems| date=July 2009| accessdate = July 2009| issue=4| volume=24|pages=14–20| doi=10.1109/mis.2009.69| last1=Murphy | first1=Robin | last2=Woods | first2=David D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the complexity of robots has increased, so has interest in developing guidelines and safeguards for their operation.&lt;ref name="moravec"&gt;[[Hans Moravec|Moravec, Hans]].

In a 2007 guest editorial in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on the topic of "Robot Ethics", SF author [[Robert J. Sawyer]] argues that since the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] is a major source of funding for robotic research (and already uses armed [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] to kill enemies) it is unlikely such laws would be built into their designs.&lt;ref name="SAWSCI"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sawyer| first=Robert J.| url=http://sfwriter.com/science.htm| doi=10.1126/science.1151606|journal=Science|date=16 November 2007|title=Guest Editorial: Robot Ethics| accessdate = 2010-10-10| volume=318| issue=5853| page=1037| pmid=18006710}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate essay, Sawyer generalizes this argument to cover other industries stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The development of AI is a business, and businesses are notoriously uninterested in fundamental safeguards — especially philosophic ones. (A few quick examples: the tobacco industry, the automotive industry, the nuclear industry. Not one of these has said from the outset that fundamental safeguards are necessary, every one of them has resisted externally imposed safeguards, and none has accepted an absolute edict against ever causing harm to humans.)&lt;ref name="SAWON3LAWS"&gt;{{cite web| last=Sawyer| first=Robert J.| url=http://www.sfwriter.com/rmasilaw.htm| title=On Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics| year=1991| accessdate = 2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Langford]] has suggested a tongue-in-cheek set of laws:

# A robot will not harm authorized Government personnel but will [[Terminate with extreme prejudice|terminate intruders with extreme prejudice]].
# A robot will obey the orders of authorized personnel except where such orders conflict with the Third Law.
# A robot will guard its own existence with lethal antipersonnel weaponry, because a robot is bloody expensive.

Roger Clarke (aka Rodger Clarke) wrote a pair of papers analyzing the complications in implementing these laws in the event that systems were someday capable of employing them. He argued "Asimov's Laws of Robotics have been a very successful literary device. Perhaps ironically, or perhaps because it was artistically appropriate, the sum of Asimov's stories disprove the contention that he began with: It is not possible to reliably constrain the behaviour of robots by devising and applying a set of rules."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Roger. ''Asimov's laws of robotics: Implications for information technology''.

Under "Enhancements to codes of ethics".&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Asimov's later novels ''[[The Robots of Dawn]]'', ''[[Robots and Empire]]'' and ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' imply that the robots inflicted their worst long-term harm by obeying the Three Laws perfectly well, thereby depriving humanity of inventive or risk-taking behaviour.

In March 2007 the [[South Korea]]n government announced that later in the year it would issue a "Robot Ethics Charter" setting standards for both users and manufacturers. According to Park Hye-Young of the Ministry of Information and Communication the Charter may reflect Asimov's Three Laws, attempting to set ground rules for the future development of robotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The futurist [[Hans Moravec]] (a prominent figure in the [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] movement) proposed that the Laws of Robotics should be adapted to "corporate intelligences" — the [[corporation]]s driven by AI and robotic manufacturing power which Moravec believes will arise in the near future.&lt;ref name="moravec"/&gt; In contrast, the [[David Brin]] novel ''[[Foundation's Triumph]]'' (1999) suggests that the Three Laws may decay into obsolescence: Robots use the Zeroth Law to rationalize away the First Law and robots hide themselves from human beings so that the Second Law never comes into play. Brin even portrays [[R. Daneel Olivaw]] worrying that, should robots continue to reproduce themselves, the Three Laws would become an evolutionary handicap and [[natural selection]] would sweep the Laws away — Asimov's careful foundation undone by [[evolutionary computation]]. Although the robots would not be evolving through ''design'' instead of ''mutation'' because the robots would have to follow the Three Laws while designing and the prevalence of the laws would be ensured,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the July/August 2009 issue of ''IEEE Intelligent Systems'', Robin Murphy (Raytheon Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&amp;M) and David D. Woods (director of the Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory at Ohio State) proposed "The Three Laws of Responsible Robotics" as a way to stimulate discussion about the role of responsibility and authority when designing not only a single robotic platform but the larger system in which the platform operates. The laws are as follows:
# A human may not deploy a robot without the human-robot work system meeting the highest legal and professional standards of safety and ethics.
# A robot must respond to humans as appropriate for their roles.
# A robot must be endowed with sufficient situated autonomy to protect its own existence as long as such protection provides smooth transfer of control which does not conflict with the First and Second Laws.&lt;ref name="IEEEMWTTLRR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/roblaw.htm |title=Want Responsible Robotics?

Woods said, "Our laws are little more realistic, and therefore a little more boring” and that "The philosophy has been, ‘sure, people make mistakes, but robots will be better – a perfect version of ourselves.’ We wanted to write three new laws to get people thinking about the human-robot relationship in more realistic, grounded ways."&lt;ref name="IEEEMWTTLRR"/&gt;

# Robots are multi-use tools. Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans, except in the interests of national security.
# Humans, not Robots, are responsible agents. Robots should be designed and operated as far as practicable to comply with existing laws, fundamental rights and freedoms, including privacy.

Asimov himself believed that his Three Laws became the basis for a new view of robots which moved beyond the "Frankenstein complex".{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} His view that robots are more than mechanical monsters eventually spread throughout science fiction.{{According to whom|date=June 2011}} Stories written by other authors have depicted robots as if they obeyed the Three Laws but tradition dictates that only Asimov could quote the Laws explicitly.{{According to whom|date=June 2011}} Asimov believed the Three Laws helped foster the rise of stories in which robots are "lovable"&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Star Wars]]'' being his favorite example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Asimov| first=Isaac| year=1995| title=Yours, Isaac Asimov: A Life in Letters|author2=Stanley Asimov | publisher=Doubleday| isbn=0-385-47622-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the laws are quoted verbatim, such as in the ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]]'' episode "Shgoratchx!", it is not uncommon for Asimov to be mentioned in the same dialogue as can also be seen in the [[Aaron Stone]] pilot where an android states that it functions under Asimov's Three Laws. However, the 1960s German TV series ''[[Raumpatrouille|Raumpatrouille – Die phantastischen Abenteuer des Raumschiffes Orion]]'' (''Space Patrol – the Fantastic Adventures of Space Ship Orion'') bases episode three titled "''Hüter des Gesetzes''" ("Guardians of the Law") on Asimov's Three Laws without mentioning the source.

References to the Three Laws have appeared in popular music ("Robot" from [[Hawkwind]]'s 1979 album ''[[PXR5]]''), cinema (''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]]''), cartoon series (''[[The Simpsons]]''), tabletop roleplaying games ([[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]) and [[webcomics]] (''[[Piled Higher and Deeper]]'' and ''[[Freefall]]'').

===The Three Laws in film===
[[Robby the Robot]] in ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956) has a hierarchical command structure which keeps him from harming humans, even when ordered to do so, as such orders cause a conflict and lock-up very much in the manner of Asimov's robots. Robby is one of the first cinematic depictions of a robot with internal safeguards put in place in this fashion. Asimov was delighted with Robby and noted that Robby appeared to be programmed to follow his Three Laws.

[[Image:Bicentennial-man-three-laws.jpg|thumb|NDR-114 explaining the Three Laws]]
Isaac Asimov's works have been adapted for cinema several times with varying degrees of critical and commercial success. Some of the more notable attempts have involved his "Robot" stories, including the Three Laws. The film ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' (1999) features [[Robin Williams]] as the Three Laws robot NDR-114 (the serial number is partially a reference to [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[CRM 114 (device)|signature numeral]]). Williams recites the Three Laws to his employers, the Martin family, aided by a holographic projection. However, the Laws were not the central focus of the film which only loosely follows the original story and has the second half introducing a love interest not present in Asimov's original short story.

[[Harlan Ellison]]'s proposed screenplay for ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' began by introducing the Three Laws, and issues growing from the Three Laws form a large part of the screenplay's plot development. This is only natural since Ellison's screenplay is one inspired by ''[[Citizen Kane]]'': a frame story surrounding four of Asimov's short-story plots and three taken from the book ''[[I, Robot]]'' itself. Ellison's adaptations of these four stories are relatively faithful although he magnifies Susan Calvin's role in two of them. Due to various complications in the Hollywood moviemaking system, to which Ellison's introduction devotes much invective, his screenplay was never filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Ellison| first=Harlan| title=I, Robot: The illustrated screenplay| publisher=Aspect| year=1994| isbn=0-446-67062-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1986 movie [[Aliens (film)|''Aliens'']], in a scene after the android [[List of Alien characters|Bishop]] accidentally cuts himself during the [[knife game]], he attempts to reassure [[Ellen Ripley|Ripley]] by stating that: "It is impossible for me to harm or by omission of action, allow to be harmed, a human being".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090605/quotes|title= Aliens (1986) - Memorable quotes |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in the 1979 movie from the same series, ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', the human crew of a starship infiltrated by a hostile alien are informed by the android [[Alien (film)#Ash|Ash]] that his instructions are: "Return alien life form, all other priorities rescinded",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/oh/quotations/movies/a/alien.html |title=ALIEN |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating how the laws governing behaviour around human safety can be rescinded by Executive Order.

In the 1987 film ''[[RoboCop]]'' and its sequels, the partially human main character has been programmed with three "prime directives" that he must obey without question. Even if different in letter and spirit they have some similarities with Asimov's Three Laws. They are:&lt;ref name="AARobocop"&gt;{{cite book |title=Alternate Americas: science fiction film and American culture |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-275-98395-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVvb6gfT4o4C&amp;pg=PA205 |author=M. Keith Booker |page=205 |quote=In a variation on Isaac Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Serve the Public Trust
# Protect the Innocent
# Uphold the Law
# Classified

These particular laws allow Robocop to harm a human being in order to protect another human, fulfilling his role as would a human law enforcement officer. The classified fourth directive is one that forbids him from harming any OCP employee, as OCP had created him, and this command overrides the others, meaning that he could not cause harm to an employee even in order to protect others.

The plot of the film released in 2004 under the name, ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' is "suggested by" Asimov's robot fiction stories&lt;ref&gt;"Suggested by" Isaac Asimov's robot stories—two stops removed from "based on" and "inspired by", the credit implies something scribbled on a bar napkin—[[Alex Proyas]]' science-fiction thriller ''I, Robot'' sprinkles Asimov's ideas like seasoning on a giant bucket of popcorn. [...] Asimov's simple and seemingly foolproof Laws of Robotics, designed to protect human beings and robots alike from harm, are subject to loopholes that the author loved to exploit. After all, much of humanity agrees in principle to abide by the [[Ten Commandments]], but [[free will]], circumstance, and contradictory impulses can find wiggle room in even the most unambiguous decree. Whenever ''I, Robot'' pauses between action beats, Proyas captures some of the excitement of movies like ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', and ''[[A.I. (film)|A.I.]]'', all of which proved that philosophy and social commentary could be smuggled into spectacle. Had the film been based on Asimov's stories, rather than merely "suggested by" them, Proyas might have achieved the intellectual heft missing from his stylish 1998 [[cult film|cult]] favorite ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]].''

and advertising for the film included a trailer featuring the Three Laws followed by the [[aphorism]], "Rules were made to be broken". The film opens with a recitation of the Three Laws and explores the implications of the [[#Zeroth Law added|Zeroth Law]] as a logical extrapolation. The major conflict of the film comes from a computer artificial intelligence, similar to the hivemind world Gaia in the [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]], reaching the conclusion that humanity is incapable of taking care of itself.&lt;ref name="BBCIrobot"&gt;{{cite news|title=A fresh prince in a robot's world |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3533118.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=11 November 2010 |first=Stephen |last=Dowling |date=4 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Philosopher [[James H. Moor]] says that if applied thoroughly they would produce unexpected results. He gives the example of a robot roaming the world trying to prevent harm from all humans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://philosophynow.org/issues/72/Four_Kinds_of_Ethical_Robots Four Kinds of Ethical Robots]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marc Rotenberg]], President and Executive Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and Professor of [[information privacy law]] at Georgetown Law, argues that the Laws of Robotics should be expanded to include two new laws:
* a Fourth Law, under which a Robot must be able to identify itself to the public ("symmetrical identification")
* a Fifth Law, dictating that a Robot must be able to explain to the public its decision making process ("algorithmic transparency").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6725">{{Weiquan Lawyers}}
[[File:HK Support Gao 20100413.jpeg|thumb|305x305px|[[Hong Kong]] Lawyers held a conference in 2010 on China "weiquan" (human rights) lawyers supporting jailed Beijing lawyer [[Gao Zhisheng]]]]
'''Weiquan lawyers''' ({{zh|维权律师}}), or “rights protection” lawyers, refer to a small but influential movement of lawyers, legal practitioners, scholars and activists who help Chinese citizens to assert their constitutional, civil rights and/or public interest through litigation and legal activism. Weiquan lawyers represents many cases regarding labour rights, land rights, official corruption, victims of torture, migrants' rights.&lt;ref name="MarazziChen2012"/&gt;

Since the 1980s, as China’s leadership became cognizant of the importance of the legal system and legal profession to advance economic development, training for lawyers dramatically increased. From 1986 to 1992, the number of lawyers in the country more than doubled from 21,500 to 45,000,  and by 2008 had reached 143,000.&lt;ref name="peopledaily"/&gt;

The proportion of Weiquan lawyers is very small, relative the number of legal professionals in China. The number of lawyers actively focusing on civil rights issues has been estimated by legal scholar [[Teng Biao]] to number "only a few dozen."&lt;ref&gt;Teng Biao, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/24/AR2009072402940.html 'Chinese Human Rights Lawyers Under Assault'], Washington Post, 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyers face considerable personal and professional obstacles, and Weiquan lawyering demands substantial commitment to their cause. According to [[Fu Hualing]] and [[Richard Cullen (attorney)|Richard Cullen]], “Weiquan lawyers act principally out of commitment, not because of any financial concerns. They accept weiquan cases to pursue their cause, and typically charge no legal fees.”&lt;ref name="ssrn"/&gt; The lawyers often face threats, harassment, and even detention when taking on cases, and they find themselves targets of repression ahead of sensitive events.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Kaiman, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/china-cracks-down-dissent-tiananmen-anniversary China cracks down on dissent ahead of Tiananmen anniversary], The Guardian, 13 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Weiquan lawyers ==
Weiquan activists include law professors with university teaching positions—including He Weifang, [[Xu Zhiyong]], and Teng Biao—professional lawyers, and “[[barefoot lawyer]]s,” who are self-taught and often lack any formal legal education.  Several of China’s more high-profile Weiquan lawyers fall into the latter category, including [[Guo Feixiong]] and [[Chen Guangcheng]].  Many barefoot lawyers are peasants who teach themselves enough law to file civil complaints, engage in litigation, and educate fellow citizens about their rights.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;

Because corporate law firms are generally not hospitable to Weiquan lawyers and legal aid workers operate within the government system, Weiquan lawyers in large cities tend to work as solo practitioners in partnership firms with other like-minded lawyers.&lt;ref name="ssrn"/&gt; The [[Beijing Global Law Firm]] and [[Yitong Law Firm]] are examples of such organizations.

Rana Siu Inboden and William Inboden note that a disproportionate number of influential Weiquan lawyers identify with the [[Christianity in China|Christian]] faith, including [[Gao Zhisheng]], Chen Guangcheng, [[Zheng Enchong]], and [[Li Heping]], among others.&lt;ref name="purdue"/&gt;

== Different approaches ==
There are at least two distinctive (and sometimes competing) approaches to Weiquan activism. Among Weiquan lawyers, the pragmatists (or consequentialists) are more deferential to the existing legal systems and institutions, and only pursue courses of actions that are likely to produce incremental improvements and reforms. These activists may reject approaches that are liable to be met with official reprisals. By contrast, the "radical" Weiquan activists (those adopting a deontological approach) view rights defending as a moral obligation that is to be pursued regardless of potential consequences.&lt;ref name="fordham"/&gt; Radical lawyers such as Gao Zhisheng are more inclined to take on the most "sensitive" cases—such as those of [[Falun Gong]] adherents—simply because it is the "right thing to do," even though the prospects of success are minimal. A pragmatist may become radicalized once they encounter the limits of possible reform.&lt;ref name="fordham"/&gt;

'''Workers''' ({{zh|t=工人|s=工人|p=gongren}}) is a book of 143 portraits of migrant workers who participated in the construction of the [[Olympic Green]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]] in the lead up to the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].  The book is the work of British artist Helen Couchman and consists primarily of photographs of the workers on the building site. The workers were photographed with the iconic buildings of the Beijing Olympics: The [[Beijing National Stadium]] (国家体育场), known colloquially as the "Bird's Nest" (鸟巢), and the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]] (国家游泳中心), also known as the "Water Cube" (水立方).

[[File:Jhang Gao pages 22-23.jpg|thumb|left|300px|&lt;center&gt;Portrait of Zhang Gao and his signature from the series ''Workers 工人''&lt;/center&gt;]]

== Background ==
At the height of its construction, nearly 17,000 workers were involved in building the "Bird's Nest".&lt;ref name=ReuDie&gt;{{cite news |first= Nick|last= Mulvenney|author2=Alex Richardson |title= Beijing says 2 died in Bird's Nest construction|url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKPEK10105320080128?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true|publisher= [[Reuters]]|date= 28 Jan 2008|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Workers 工人'' documents the human side of construction with worker portraits, information on the workers themselves, and details on how Couchman carried out the project.  In December 2007, Couchman circumvented security on the Olympic construction site and was able to approach the workers about taking their pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Toy, Mary-Anne.

== Reception ==
In the book's introduction, British art critic Peter Suchin writes that the way Couchman positions the workers at roughly the same spot for each portrait suggests they can also be seen as "one single portrait, that of `the worker' engaged in the making of the Place of the Games ... the central focus, the essential signifier of the new Beijing".  Photographs from this series were exhibited in [[London]], England and [[Hong Kong]]. Discussions of workers' rights have been raised in the context of this book, but it was not Couchman's reason for starting the project.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Tse-wei.

The '''XCOR Lynx''' was a proposed [[suborbital]] [[HTHL|horizontal-takeoff, horizontal-landing]] (HTHL),
[[rocket-powered aircraft|rocket-powered]] [[spaceplane]] that was under development by the California-based company [[XCOR Aerospace]] to compete in the emerging suborbital spaceflight market. The Lynx was intended to carry one pilot, a ticketed passenger, and/or a payload above 100&amp;nbsp;km altitude. The concept was under development since 2003, when a two-person suborbital spaceplane was announced under the name Xerus.

In January 2016, XCOR changed plans for the first flight of the Lynx spaceplane. It was initially planned for the second quarter of 2016 from the [[Midland International Air and Space Port|Midland spaceport]] in Texas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrt.com/business/development/article_59287c2e-5682-11e5-b319-e7ad9e129220.html?mode=jqm|title=MSDC president: Lynx will launch from Midland this fiscal year|work=MRT.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in early 2016 it was pushed to an "undisclosed and tentative" date at the [[Mojave spaceport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrt.com/news/top_stories/article_0783b3da-bced-11e5-97bc-6f2e78081a3e.html|title=XCOR officials refrain from disclosing date for Lynx test flights|publisher=Midland Reporter-Telegram|date=17 January 2016|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a21103/the-xcor-lynx-spaceplane-might-be-down-for-the-count//|title=The XCOR Lynx Spaceplane Might Be Down for the Count|date=31 May 2016|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; XCOR announced development of the Lynx had been halted with layoffs of approximately one-third of the staff; the company intends to concentrate on development of their liquid hydrogen rocket under contract with [[United Launch Alliance]], instead.&lt;ref name=sn20160531/&gt;

Following the bankruptcy of XCOR Aerospace in 2017, the assets of the company were sold to the nonprofit organization Build A Plane, which will focus on education rather than suborbital flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-04-30|title=Bankrupt Spaceflight Company's Space Plane Assets to Help Young Minds Soar|url=https://www.space.com/40352-xcor-aerospace-lynx-space-plan-stem-education.html|newspaper=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Xerus===
In 2003, XCOR proposed the '''Xerus''' (pronunciation: zEr'us) [[suborbital spaceplane]] concept. It was to be capable of transporting one pilot and one passenger as well as some [[Suborbital spaceflight#Scientific experiments|science experiments]] and it would even be capable of carrying an [[upper stage]] which would launch near [[apogee]] and therefore would potentially be able to carry [[satellite]]s into [[Low Earth Orbit|low-Earth orbit]].&lt;ref name=sdc20030519&gt;[http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/xcor_xerus_030520.html Space.com: ''XCOR Zeroes in on Xerus''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208081624/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/xcor_xerus_030520.html |date=December 8, 2009 }}, ''[[space.com]]'', 2003-05-19, accessed 2011-01-04.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 2007, XCOR continued to refer to their future two-person spaceplane concept as ''Xerus''.&lt;ref name=sdc20070423&gt;{{cite news|last=David|first=Leonard|title=XCOR Pursues Dream a Step at a Time|url=http://www.space.com/3589-xcor-pursues-dream-step-time.html|accessdate=2013-10-21|newspaper=Space.com|date=2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- a search of the Space.com site reveals about a half-dozen mentions of Xerus over those years. --&gt;

In May 2016, the company halted development of the Lynx spaceplane and pivoted company focus toward development its [[LOX]]/[[LH2]] engine technology, particularly on a funded project for [[United Launch Alliance]]. The company [[laid off]] more than 20 people of the 50–60 persons onboard prior to May.&lt;ref name=sn20160531&gt;

Media reports in 2014 anticipated that by the end of 2015&lt;ref name = Nilsson&gt;Nilsson, Eric and Zhangyu, Deng (25 October 2014) "The Final Frontier" Daily Telegraph supplement "China Watch" Page 1&lt;/ref&gt; or in 2016&lt;ref name = Woollaston/&gt; the Lynx was expected to begin flying suborbital [[space tourism]] flights and scientific research missions from a new [[spaceport]] on the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Curaçao]].&lt;ref&gt;(2012) [http://www.spacexc.com/en/bookings/ SXC - Buying your tickets into space!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306043002/http://www.spacexc.com/en/bookings/ |date=March 6, 2013 }} SXC web page, Retrieved 5 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writers | title = Space Expedition Corporation Announces Wet Lease of XCOR Lynx Suborbital | work = Space Media Network Promotions | publisher = Space-Travel.com   | date = October 6, 2010 | url = http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Space_Experience_Curacao_Announces_Wet_Lease_of_XCOR_Lynx_Suborbital_999.html  | accessdate = 2010-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Space Experience Curacao | work = Home | publisher = Space Experience Curacao  | date = 2009–2010 | url = http://spaceexperiencecuracao.com/ | accessdate = 2010-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company stated in January 2016 that they had not assigned a new projected date for test flights and a date for the launch of commercial operations could not be anticipated.&lt;ref name="MRT"/&gt;

Because it lacked any propulsion system other than its rocket engines, the Lynx would have to be towed to the end of the runway.  Once positioned on the runway, the pilot would have ignited the four rocket engines, take-off and begin a steep climb. The engines will be shut off at approximately 138,000 feet (42&amp;nbsp;km) and [[mach number|Mach]] 2. The [[spaceplane]] would then continue to climb, unpowered until it reached an [[apogee]] of approximately 200,000 feet (61&amp;nbsp;km).  The spacecraft would have experienced a little over four minutes of weightlessness, before re-entering the Earth's [[atmosphere]]. The occupants of the Lynx were intended to have experienced up to four times normal gravity during re-entry. After re-entry, the Lynx would have glided down and performed an unpowered landing. The total flight time was projected to last about 30 minutes.&lt;ref name=engine/&gt; The Lynx was expected to be able to perform 40 flights before maintenance was required.

{{asof|2011|03}}, Orbital Outfitters was reportedly designing [[pressure suit]]s for XCOR use.&lt;ref name=suborbital&gt;{{cite web | title=Commercial Spacesuit Companies Compete for Market Share | url = http://www.parabolicarc.com/2011/03/21/commercial-spacesuit-companies-compete-market-share/| publisher= Parabolic Arc| date=March 21, 2011| accessdate=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2013|11|3}}.

As of 2012, the successor to the Mark II might have been a two-stage, fully reusable orbital vehicle that took off and landed horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fee.org/freeman/detail/the-next-frontier-an-interview-with-lee-valentine|title=The Next Frontier: An Interview with Lee Valentine|date=30 November 2012|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
