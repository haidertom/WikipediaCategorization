      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2970">While the [[Africa]]n continent is vast and its peoples diverse, certain standards of beauty and correctness in artistic expression and physical appearance are held in common among various African societies. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = M. | year = 1989 | title = African visual arts from an art historical perspective | url = | journal = African Studies Review | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 55–103 | doi=10.2307/523970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken collectively, these values and standards have been characterised as comprising a generally accepted '''African aesthetic'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Welsh-Asante|first=Kariamu |title=The African Aesthetic:  Keeper of the Traditions (Contributions in Afro- and African-American Studies) |year=1993 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-313-26549-5 |page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cool==

In ''African Art in Motion'', African art scholar and [[Yale]] professor [[Robert Farris Thompson]] turns his attention to cool in both the African and [[African-American]] contexts:   
    
&lt;blockquote&gt;The mind of an elder within the body of the young is suggested by the striking African custom of dancing "hot" with a "cool" unsmiling face. This quality seems to have haunted [[Ten Rhyne]] at the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]] in 1673 and it struck the imagination of an early observer of strongly African-influenced dancing in [[Louisiana]] in the early nineteenth century, who noted "thumping ecstasy" and "intense solemnity of mien." The mask of the cool, or facial serenity, has been noted at many points in Afro-American history:  
    
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is interesting that what remains a spiritual principle in some parts of Africa and the rare African-influenced portions of the modern U.S.A., such as [[Tidelands|tidewater]] [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], becomes in the mainline [[African American|Afro-American]] urban culture an element of contemporary street behavior:
    
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Negro]] boys…have a 'cool' way of walking in which the upper trunk and pelvis rock fore and aft while the head remains stable with the eyes looking straight ahead. The…walk is quite slow, and the Negroes take it as a way of 'strutting' or 'showing off'....&lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
The cool style of male walking in the United States is called ''bopping'' ...  Mystical coolness in Africa has changed in urban African-American assertions of independent power. But the functions, to heal and gather strength, partially remain. And the name ''cool'' [''kule''], remains. And the body is still played in two patterns, one stable, the other active, part energy and part mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Thompson|first=Robert Farris |authorlink=Robert Farris Thompson| title=African Art in Motion |year=1974 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-02703-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Altarpiece with Christ, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Margaret MET DP102925.jpg|thumb|The altarpiece]]
The '''''Altarpiece with Christ, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Margaret''''' is an autographed 1434 sculpture in [[Carrara marble]] by the Italian artist [[Andrea da Giona]], now in the collection of [[The Cloisters]] in [[New York City]]. It was commissioned by the Knights of Malta, a band of violent Christian sailors preoccupied with defending Spain from Muslim invasion.&lt;ref name="w12"&gt;Wixom, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The carving is in the late [[International Gothic]] style, as evidenced by its folds of draperies, lush folidates, and the heavily idealised facial types of the main saints.&lt;ref name="w12" /&gt;

[[Christ in Majesty]] is at the center, flanked by the Virgin Mary and the angel [[Gabriel]], with other angels playing musical instruments. The four [[Evangelism|Evangelists]] are placed at each corner. Inscriptions below the central panel read &lt;small&gt;"HOC OPUS FECIT MAGISTER AND[R]EAS DA GIONA MCCCCXXXIIII" (This work was made by Master Andrea from Giona 1434).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/471909 Altarpiece with Christ, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Margaret]".

'''''Apparition of the Virgin to St. Bernard''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] painter [[Filippino Lippi]], completed around 1485–1487.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, Eliot W., and Marilyn Bradshaw. "Lippi family." Grove Art Online. January 01, 2003. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in the [[Badia Fiorentina]], a church in [[Florence]].

The picture was commissioned for the chapel of Francesco del Pugliese by the latter's son Piero, who is portrayed in the lower right corner in the traditional praying posture of the [[donor portrait]].

It is one of the most admired Lippi's works,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artonline.it/opera.asp?IDOpera=1424 Page at artonline.it] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001102/http://www.artonline.it/opera.asp?IDOpera=1424 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its powerful, Flemish-inspired chromatism and attention to details, which contribute in turning the mystical apparition of the Virgin to [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]] into an everyday life scene. The composition is set in a rocky landscape in which the saint, while writing on his [[lectern]], is suddenly visited by the Virgin. Behind Bernard's shoulders is depicted the demon biting his chains: this is a reference to a medieval hymn celebrating the Virgin as the liberator of humanity from the chains of their sins.

A scroll on a rock contains a verse by the 3rd century AD [[Stoicism|stoic]] writer [[Epictetus]]: ''Sustine et abstine'' ("Carry on and abstain"), a hint to Bernard's teachings.

Some scholars have identified in the faces of the Virgin and the angels on the left the portraits of the donor's wife and sons

[[Image:ArmenianNeedlelace.jpg|right|thumbnail|Armenian Needlelace ''circa'' 2004]]
'''Armenian needlelace''' (also known as '''Bebilla''', '''Nazareth Lace''' and '''Knotted Lace''') is a pure form of [[needle lace]] made using only a needle, thread and pair of scissors. 

==History==
Like [[filet lace|lacis, or filet lace]], Armenian needlelace seems to be an obvious descendant of net making. Where lacis adds decorative stitches to a net ground, Armenian needlelace involves making the net itself decorative.

There is some archeological evidence suggesting the use of lace in prehistoric [[Armenia]] and the prevalence of pre-Christian symbology in traditional designs would certainly suggest a pre-Christian root for this art form.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In contrast to [[Europe]] where lace was the preserve of the nobility, in Armenia it decorated everything from traditional headscarves to lingerie and lacemaking was part of many or most women's lives.

==Technique==
The lace is made by tying knots, usually tied onto the previous round of the piece creating small loops of thread onto which the next round of knots can be tied. Patterns are created by varying the length of the loops, missing loops from the previous round, adding extra loops and similar.

When used as an edging the lace can be made directly onto the hem of the fabric being edged. When a doily or freeform object (such as the birds and flowers decorating traditional headscarves) is being started a series of loops is tied onto a slip knot which is pulled tight to complete the first round.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4234">'''Baile Chuind Chétchathaig''' ("The Vision of [[Conn of the Hundred Battles]]") is an [[Old Irish]] list of [[Kings of Tara]] or [[list of High Kings of Ireland|High Kings of Ireland]] which survives in two 16th-century manuscripts, [[23 N 10]] and [[Egerton 88]]. It is the earliest such king-list known, probably dating from around 700 AD. The later ''[[Baile In Scáil]]'' is closely related.

==Date==
Baile Chuind Chétchathaig was first edited by [[Rudolf Thurneysen]], who dated it to about 700 AD and believed it to have been included in the lost ''[[Cín Dromma Snechtai]]'' manuscript. Thurneysen later revised this opinion on the basis of the content of the poem, supposing that the poem's "Glúnshalach" represented 10th-century king [[Niall Glúndub]]. Later editors and writers have generally preferred Thurneysen's first estimate, taking the work to have been begun in the lifetime of [[Fínsnechta Fledach]] (died 695).&lt;ref&gt;Murray, "Manuscript Tradition", p. 69; Bhreathnach &amp; Murray, "Edition", p. 73; Bhreathnach, "Political Context", pp. 49 &amp; 61&amp;ndash;62; Byrne, ''Irish Kings'', p. 54; Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'', p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent studies [[Edel Bhreathnach]] has suggested that the current form of the poem may be somewhat later. While the kings who follow Fínsnechta were previously interpreted as imagined future kings, Bhreathnach suggests that these are in fact historical figures from the first quarter of the eighth century disguised by [[kenning]]s. If this is correct, the poem as a whole dates from around 720 or  was revised at about that time.&lt;ref&gt;Bhreathnach, "Political Context", p. 50; Murray, "Manuscript Tradition", p. 70; Mac Shamhráin &amp; Byrne, "Prosopography", pp. 159 &amp; 204&amp;ndash;212.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Banco del libro.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Banco del libro in [[Caracas, Venezuela]]]]
'''Banco del Libro''' is a [[non-profit organization]] for the promotion of [[children's literature]], with headquarters in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]]. It was established in 1960 as a centre for the exchange of textbooks – hence the name Banco del Libro (Book Bank). As it has grown it has diversified to promote reading in Venezuela, in every conceivable arena and genre of children’s literature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6798">[[Image:Banksia coccinea (Illustrationes Florae Novae Hollandiae plate 3).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Banksia coccinea]]'' from [[Ferdinand Bauer]]'s 1813 work ''[[Illustrationes Florae Novae Hollandiae]]'']]
A '''botanical illustrator''' is a person who paints, sketches or otherwise [[botanical illustration|illustrates botanical]] subjects. Typical illustrations are in watercolour, but may also be in oils, ink or pencil, or a combination of these. The image may be life size or not, the scale is often shown, and may show the habit and habitat of the plant, the upper and reverse sides of leaves, and details of flowers, bud, seed and root system.

Botanical illustration is sometimes used as a [[Biological type|type]] for attribution of a [[botanical name]] to a [[taxon]]. The inability of botanists to conserve certain dried specimens, or restrictions on safe transport, have meant illustrations have been nominated as the type for some names. Many minute plants, which may only be viewed under a microscope, are often identified by an illustration to overcome the difficulties in using slide mounted specimens. The standards for this are by international agreement (Art 37.5 of the Vienna Code, 2006)...


==History==
The use of illustrations was frequently seen in the herbals, seed catalogues and popular works of natural history. The illustrations produced during the eighteenth and nineteenth century are regarded as both appealing and scientifically valid. The finer detail of the printing processes, greatly improving at this time, allowed artists such as [[Franz Bauer|Franz]] and [[Ferdinand Bauer]] to depict the minute aspects of the subject. The use of exploded details would further illustrate the description given in the accompanying text.  These details allowed a non scientific audience to go some way in identifying the species, the widening interest in natural history and horticulture was an inducement to the production of many [[Flora]]s and regular publications.

Many books and publication continued to use the illustrators, even after printed matter began to incorporate photography.  It would be many years before the colour printing would equal the illustrators plates.  The accuracy and craft of the illustrators had developed in tandem with the botanists concerned, the work came to be accepted as important to the botanists and their institutions. The illustrated publication, [[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]] (1787), was to eventually appoint an official artist. The 230-year-old magazine, long associated with the [[Linnaean Society]] and [[Kew Gardens]], is now primarily one of finer botanical illustration. A stream of the finest illustrators to appear in print have been featured in the magazine.

The contribution of botanical illustrators continues to be praised and sought, very fine examples continue to be produced. In the 1980s, [[Celia Rosser]] undertook to illustrate every ''Banksia'' species for the masterwork, ''[[The Banksias]]''. When another species was described after its publication, ''[[Banksia rosserae]]'', it was named to honour her mammoth accomplishment. Other illustrators, such as the profuse illustrator [[Matilda Smith]], have been specifically honoured for this work. In 1972 the [[Smithsonian Institution]] hired its first botanical illustrator, [[Alice Tangerini]].&lt;ref name="Tangerini3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalcommunitynews.com/content/botanical-illustrator-alice-tangerini|title=Botanical Illustrator Alice Tangerini|last=Corson|first=Cheryl|date=March 9, 2017|publisher=Capital Community News Inc.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=[[Hill Rag]]|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bèze Abbey''' ({{lang-fr|Abbaye Saint-Pierre, Saint-Paul de Bèze}}), was a monastery founded in 629&amp;nbsp;AD in Burgundy, France. 
It was destroyed several times during the next three centuries by Frankish warlords, Saracens, Normans and Hungarians.
At the end of the 10th century the abbey was re-founded and entered a golden age for the next two centuries.
By the 13th century the spiritual life of the abbey had declined and the monks were mainly concerned with temporal matters. 
The abbey lost most of its monks during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the [[Black Death]] of the 14th century.
In 1429 it was fortified with stone walls, a moat and towers, two of which have survived.
The abbey was again devastated by feuds in 1513, and by the [[French Wars of Religion]] (1562–98) and the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48).

In 1662 a final revival began when the monastery came under the [[Congregation of Saint Maur]].
Most of the surviving buildings date from the reconstruction by this congregation in the 18th century.
At the start of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 the monastery was dissolved and the property taken over by the state.
It was sold, and the church and main buildings demolished so the stone could be used for building.
The owners of the property added an orangerie and laid out a park in the 19th century.
Today the private owners have made the grounds and buildings open for visitors for a small fee.

==Foundation==

The Abbey of Saint-Pierre &amp; Saint-Paul{{efn|Bèze Abbey is also known as Besuense Monasterium, St Pierre-de-Bèze and Abbaye-de-la-Fontaine-de-Bèze.{{sfn|Williams|1938|p=5}} }} in [[Bèze]], Côte-d'Or, was the fourth of the [[Merovingian]] abbeys of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Langres|diocese of Langres]], after [[Moutiers-Saint-Jean Abbey|Moûtiers-Saint-Jean]], [[Dijon Cathedral|Saint-Bénigne]] and [[Saint-Seine-l'Abbaye|Saint-Seine]].{{sfn|Abbaye de Bèze – Comité Régional}}
The abbey was founded by Amalgaire&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Amalgaire|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt;, Duke of Lower Burgundy, brother of [[Waldalenus]], Duke of Upper Burgundy and father of Saint [[Donatus of Besançon]].{{sfn|Dunod de Charnage|1750|p=192}}
Amalgaire founded the abbey in the reign of [[Chlothar II]] (r. 613–629) in the autumn of 629.{{sfn|Dupraz|1961|p=26}}{{efn|The abbey's foundation date seems to be between 1 September and 18 October 629, when Clothar died.{{sfn|Dupraz|1961|p=26}} }}
The abbey's location was called the "Fountain of Bèze", after a [[karst spring]] that is the source of the [[Bèze (river)|Bèze river]].
The ''Chronique de Bèze'' from the first 3rd of the 12th century, describes foundation of the abbey on an unoccupied site.{{sfn|Marillier|Velard|1958|p=35}}
The Chronicle says:
{{blockquote|He found a place between the [[Saône]] and [[Tille (river)|Tille]], where there sprang an important river called Bèze, with very clear waters, drinkable and rich in all sorts of fish. This river was not like the others which, along their course, increase by receiving streams; from its source, it is a great river. There are all kinds of herbs that can serve as food in case of scarcity ... The land is fairly good and bears abundant fruit if it is cultivated. The meadows are quite rich; it is possible to raise flocks. Forests surround this place; they are sufficient to provide timber and all that is necessary to man.{{sfn|Chronicon beanense|p=234}} }}

Amalgaire's wife Aquilina gave him two sons and one daughter, born between 595 and 605.
His son Adalric would succeed him while his son Waldelene was educated as a monk at the [[Luxeuil Abbey]] under the [[Rule of Saint Columbanus]].
His daughter Adalsinde also became a nun.{{sfn|Dupraz|1961|p=26}}
Waldelene became the first abbot at Bèze.{{sfn|Dunod de Charnage|1750|p=56}}
Amalgaire also founded a monastery at [[Bregille (Besançon)|Bregille]] on the right bank of the [[Doubs (river)|Doubs]] for his daughter Adalsinde, who became its first abbess. 
This monastery was given the existing Church of Saint Martin at Bregville.{{sfn|Dunod de Charnage|1750|p=56}}
Amalgaire gave the Bèze Abbey a rich endowment of 31 domains with forests, vineyards and buildings, cultivators and winegrowers.{{sfn|Dupraz|1961|p=26}}
He gave it vineyards in the Gevrey-Chambertin region that today are the source of the famous [[Chambertin-Clos de Bèze]] red Burgundy wine.{{sfn|Parker|2010|p=408}}

==Merovingian period (629–714)==

The monks of Bèze followed the [[Rule of Saint Columbanus]], which Waldalène brought from [[Luxeuil Abbey]].
The first buildings were a rectangular stone structure surrounded by wood and earth outbuildings with thatched roofs.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
After the death of Amalgaire around 655 civil war raged in Burgundy and the country was ravaged by rival bands of [[Neustria]]n and [[Austrasia]]n Franks.{{sfn|Choullier|1879|p=339}}
The reign of [[Chlothar III]] (r. 657–673), son of [[Clovis II]] (r. 639–657), had just started in Austrasia in late 657 when civil disturbances made Brégille untenable.
Adalsinde and her brother Adalric begged her brother Waldelène and his monks to give her and her nuns refuge in Bèze, and in return transferred to him the priests of Saint Martin.{{sfn|Dupraz|1961|p=28}}

Bèze was also ruined, its property titles destroyed and its monks scattered.
When peace was restored Waldalene made haste to repair the losses of his monastery.
To proceed faster he used credit from the new [[Duke of Burgundy]], Sichelm.{{sfn|Choullier|1879|p=339}}
A diploma was issued by Chlothar III in 658 or 664 that confirmed the donations made by Amalgaire.{{sfn|Choullier|1879|p=339}}
Duke Adalric lost his duchy some time between 658 and 664.{{sfn|Dupraz|1961|p=34}}
The king entrusted the lord Gengoul with the protection of the abbey.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
The duke, or his son [[Adalrich, Duke of Alsace]], was restored to possession of the monastery of Bèze by the royal precept of 665.{{sfn|Dupraz|1961|p=34}}
Adalric abused his authority to ransack the abbey.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
Later Adalric deserted King [[Theuderic III]] of Neustria (r. 673–691) and joined his enemies, who chose [[Dagobert II]] (r. 676–679) as King of Austrasia.{{sfn|Wood|2014|loc=PT361}}

[[File:Theuderic III.jpg|thumb|[[Theuderic III]] of Neustria]]
The war between Theuderic of Neustria and Dagobert of Austrasia once more devastated Bèze.
Waldalène had to rebuild the abbey from ruins.
In 676 Theuderic, now victorious, gave Waldalène all of Adalric's property.{{sfn|Duplus|1866|p=130}}
Adalric settled permanently in Alsace after the troubles of 675–676.{{sfn|Dupraz|1961|p=35}}
Waldalène died in 680.{{sfn|Duplus|1866|p=128}}
The abbey flourished under the three abbots that followed, Bercand or Bercang, around 680, Ferréol around 700 and Syranne around 720.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}

==Carolingian period (714–990)==

The [[Saracen]]s, who had conquered Spain in 714, crossed the Pyrennees and devastated the south of France.
They penetrated up the [[Rhône]], the [[Saône]] and the [[Loire]] until finally defeated by [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732.{{sfn|Duplus|1866|p=65}}
The Saracens sacked the abbey of Bèze around 730.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
Dom [[Jean Mabillon]] relates that they destroyed [[Autun]], pulled down the Abbey of Bèze (''monasterium Besuense''), were repulsed from [[Sens]] when they attacked it in 732, but then massacred Saint Mellin and the monks of Luxeuil Abbey.{{sfn|Lagneau|1870|p=160}}
The anthropologist Gustave Lagneau&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Gustave Lagneau|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt; considered that some of the present population of the region showed signs of Saracen descent.{{sfn|Lagneau|1870|p=160}}

Between 751 and 754 King [[Pepin the Short]] (r. 751–768) gave the abbey to his concubine, Angla or Anglais wife of Théodard, to be desecrated or dilapidated by her according to her caprice.{{sfn|Guillon|1817|p=38}}
Pepin also dismissed the bishop of Langres at this time, and replaced him by his brother Remi.{{sfn|Guillon|1817|p=98}}
After this the abbey was entrusted to the bishops of Langres, but due to the difficulties of the times it was only rebuilt under the Emperor [[Louis the Pious]] (r. 814–840), when Bishop Albéric restored the buildings and reintroduced discipline.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}

Albéric was made Bishop of Langres by Louis the Pious around 820.{{sfn|Tems|1775|p=503}}
The Chronicle of Bèze relates that Albéric was afflicted by a violent colic that made him despair of his life.
An old man appeared to him in a dream and told him he would recover if he promised to reestablish the monastery.
He made the promise and regained his health.{{sfn|Tems|1775|p=503}}
Albéric gave Bèze the church of Saint Laurent in [[Beurey]] in 830.{{sfn|Choullier|1879|p=342}}
Louis the Pious visited Langres in 830 with his son [[Lothair I|Lothair]] and held a provincial council.{{sfn|Tems|1775|p=504}}
This council and other synods seem to have resulted in the general reform that reestablished the common life of the canons and caused all the monasteries to restore their original rules.{{sfn|Mangen|1765|p=370}}
At Albéric's request Louis issued a charter that confirmed all the property of the abbey.{{sfn|Choullier|1879|p=340}}{{efn|A manuscript from Bèze states that the council at Langres in 830 granted the monks the tithes from certain vineyards donated to them by their founder. It is possible that this is a later fabrication used to support Bèze in a dispute with the canons of Langres.{{sfn|Constable|1964|p=211}} }}
Albéric repaired the church of Saint-Mammès at the abbey.{{sfn|Tems|1775|p=504}}
Alberic died in 839 and his body was taken to Bèze on 22 December 839.{{sfn|Mangen|1765|p=367}}

[[File:Kalandozasok.jpg|thumb|Hungarian campaigns in Europe]]
On 6 October 883 Geilon, bishop of Langres, gave the abbey of Bèze the relics of Saint [[Prudent de Narbonne]], which he had brought back from a chapel in [[Narbonne]] after his pilgrimage to [[Santiago de Compostela]].{{sfn|Duplus|1866|p=322}}
In 887, when marauding [[Normans]] approached the monks of Bèze transported the body of Saint Prudent to Saint-Etienne de Dijon. 
When the invasion was over the monks rebuilt the ruins of the abbey and asked for the saint's body from Dijon.{{sfn|Duplus|1866|p=323}}
The canons of Dijon at first refused, then at the command of Bishop Gauthier of Langres pretended to comply, but in fact gave the monks the body of Saint Silvin.
Eventually the ruse was discovered, and the body of Saint Prudent was carried with great ceremony from Dijon to Bèze in 931.{{sfn|Duplus|1866|p=323}}

The abbey was destroyed twice during the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]]. It was burned in July 936 when the Hungarians came from Burgundy, and again the next year when the Hungarians had spread through France, Burgundy and Aquitaine, plundering and ravaging everywhere.{{sfn|Mangen|1765|p=414}}
The Hungarians caused so much damage to the monastery that it could not be restored for eleven years.{{sfn|Mangen|1765|p=415}}

==Golden age (990–1200)==
[[File:Guillaume de Dijon.JPG|thumb|[[William of Volpiano]], Abbot of Bèze from 990 to 1031]]
At the end of the 10th century Bruno de Roucy, Bishop of Langres, asked [[Majolus of Cluny]] to send monks to rebuild the abbeys of the Langres diocese.
Among them was [[William of Volpiano]],{{efn|Much of what is known of William of Volpiano comes from the ''Life of St William of Dijon'' by Rodulphus Glaber, a former monk at Bèze and other abbeys who finally settled at Cluny. He is not a particularly reliable source.{{sfn|Williams|1938|p=100}} }} who became abbot of Saint-Bénigne at Dijon, and was also abbot of Bèze from 990 until his death in 1031.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
William introduced the customs of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] to both abbeys.{{sfn|Vergnolle|2001|p=234}}
The [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] is first mentioned in the Chronicle of Beze when it comes to the William, an Italian who became abbot in 990.{{sfn|O'Carroll |1953|p=414}}
Unlike Saint-Bénigne, the properties of the abbey were concentrated in the immediate vicinity, towards [[Champlitte]] and the [[Saône]].
Thanks to William's reforms Bèze attracted gifts from local nobles such as the Fouvents, descendants of the counts of Atuyer, the Beaumonts and Montsaugeons towards Langres and the Beaujeus on the Saône.{{sfn|Vergnolle|2001|p=234}}
The property included serfs. For example, in the 11th century the abbey received the serf Arnulf and "one half of the sons or daughters of the said Arnulf" for the benefit of Sir Henri de Ferté's soul.{{sfn|Coulton|2012|loc=PT40}}

Raoul le Blanc, Viscount of Dijon, became a monk at Saint-Bénigne, then was made grand-prior of Bèze under abbot William and played a major role in the restoration of the abbey.{{sfn|Débax|2008|p=269}}
Raoul dedicated his immense fortune to entirely rebuilding the abbey, including executing two ossuaries in the chapel of the Virgin and replacing the remains of the old destroyed tombs. {{sfn|Bulletin de la Société historique ... Langres 1959|p=258}}
He rebuilt the church on a larger scale, and it was dedicated in 1016 or 1018 in a ceremony arranged by Lambert de Vignory, Brunon's successor as bishop in a ceremony attended by many bishops and clergy from various provinces of France.{{sfn|Kleinclausz|1895|p=226}}
In 1018 the lord of Fouvent founded the priory of Saint-Sépulcre beside his castle, subordinate to Bèze abbey.{{sfn|Vergnolle|2001|p=234}}

Ulger or Olger 1, former prior of Beze, was abbot from 1031 to 1052.
He died on return from a pilgrimage to Jersusalem. {{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
In October 1050 [[Pope Leo IX]] visited Langres, where he settled a dispute between the Bèze monks and the Langres canons over tithes from one of the monks' vineyards. He said that "By the authority of the Holy Fathers who preceded me in the see of Rome, it was permitted that no church founded in honour of St Peter, the prince of the Apostles, should pay a rent of tithes to another church." This silenced the canons.{{sfn|Constable|1964|p=215}} 
In 1066 a solemn assembly of bishops, abbots and local lords was held at the abbey of Bèze to settle difference between the abbot of Saint-Benigne and the officers of [[Robert I, Duke of Burgundy|Robert, Duke of Burgundy]].{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
In 1083 Ponce, lord of the Château de Beaujeu, gave the abbey a chapel built in honour of Saint Vallier with lands and various rights.{{sfn|Vergnolle|2001|p=234}}

Étienne de Joinville&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Étienne de Joinville|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt; was the son and grandson of counts on his father's side, and grandson of Arnoul, count of Reynel on his mother's side.
He served as a soldier before becoming a monk.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
He was a monk at the Priory of Saint-Oyan-de-Bar and then at Cluny, where his uncle Widon was Grand Prior.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
He was appointed prior at Sainte-Germaine de Bar-sur-Aube, then of Bar-sur-Seine.
In 1088 he was chosen as abbot of Bèze by bishop Robert.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
Under the abbot Étienne de Jonvelle (c. 1088–1124) the grants multiplied, particularly in the form of restitution of churches.{{sfn|Vergnolle|2001|p=234}}
Humbert de Fouvent, who had been killed in the service of the Bishop of Langres around 1085–87, was buried at Bèze.
His widow gave the abbey the chapel of his castle, the church of Lavoncourt and two silver ''cyphes''.{{sfn|Vergnolle|2001|p=235}}
In 1093 Irmuin de Seveux gave the abbey the churches of Saint-Denis and Saint-Laurent.{{sfn|Vergnolle|2001|p=232}}
[[Pope Paschal II]] stayed at the abbey in 1107.
He was accompanied by Henry, Abbot of [[Saint-Jean-d'Angély]].{{sfn|Clark|1969|p=550}}

[[File:Paschal Alberici.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Paschal II]] ]]
Étienne doubled the size of the abbey's domain by restitution and donations, and expanded the abbey buildings, extending the church to the river.
{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}{{efn|Étienne de Joinville's epitaph says ''ecclesiae caput extendit super amnem'' (he extended the church head on the river).{{sfn|Brasart|2014}} }}
There are still remains of an axial chapel from the early 12th century.{{sfn|Lauvergeon|2000}}
This is all that is left of Étienne's buildings.
The chapels would have extended towards the Bèze river from the apse of the church.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}{{efn|The chapels today are buried due to the work of the abbot Jean de Sauveboeuf around 1680, who raised the river level to obtain a greater head of water to power the abbey forges. He dumped over 4,000 cart loads of earth and stone into the river to raise its bed.
The complaints by the people of Bèze to the Intendant of Langres about the abbot's action have been preserved.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}} }}
Under Étienne's rule the number of monks grew to about 50 living in the abbey and another 50 in subordinate priories.
The monk Jean (died 1120) wrote the ''Chronicon Besuense'', a history of the abbey from its foundation to the start of the 12th century.
The monk Teobaudus (died 1130) wrote the ''Miracula Sancti Prudentii'', which described the miraculous cures that had been effected by the relics of Saint Prudent. 
The monk Raoul the Bald wrote the ''Libri Quinque Historiae'', a history of events from 900 to 1044.
He famously wrote of the period, "At that time the kingdom of France was covered with a white cloak of churches."
In 1198 the abbey was accidentally burned.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}

==Feudalism, decline and ruin (1200–1662)==

In 1215 the abbot Albert received a letter from Pope Innocent III on the subject of damages caused by a fire which had forced the abbot to send the monks to Cluny.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
In 1219 the abbey finally accepted an offer that had first been made in 1049 and sold its Clos de Bèze vineyard to the canons of Langres.{{sfn|Pitte|2012|p=48}}{{efn|The Cathedral Chapter of Saint-Mammès at Langres was the nominal owner of the Clos de Bèze vineyards until the French Revolution, but in the 17th century it leased them to lay owners.{{sfn|Coates|2008|p=83}} }} 
Over time the rule was relaxed and the monks became more concerned with temporal than spiritual matters.
In 1253 the abbot Geoffroy II was the first to hold the feudal title "Baron de Bèze".
Around 1280 the abbot Girard III built a school outside the village for children who were not destined for the church.
The building on the Place de Verdun still stands.
The archives tell of disputes between the abbot and the bishop of Langres, disputes between the monks and the people of Bèze, disputes with the local lords, disputes over feudal dues and rights of use.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
In 1307 a dispute between the Bèze Abbey and some burgesses of the abbey was heard first by the Jours de Troyes, then escalated to the king's [[Parlement]].{{sfn|Benton|1991|p=205}}

The [[Hundred Years' War]] began in 1337.{{sfn|Seward|1999|loc=PT53}}
The [[Black Death]] appeared in [[Marseille]], then spread throughout France in 1348–49.
Some thought the world was ending, and others thought God was punishing France for her sins.{{sfn|Seward|1999|loc=PT53}}
[[Guillaume de Chanac]] became abbot in 1352. 
He later became bishop of Chartres and a cardinal.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
In 1389 a complaint was lodged by 15 officers and monks of the abbey against the abbot Thiéry de Charmes concerning maladministration of the neighboring school. 
The award, issued by the court of Langes on the Saturday before [[Pentecost]], meticulously itemized the rights and duties of the abbot.
These included the requirement to supply wine to the master and clerics of Bèze to drink after [[vigils]].{{sfn|Muteau|1882|p=107}}

[[File:Bèze - Tour des Chaux.jpg|thumb|Chaix Tower in the south]]
Simon de Torcenay was abbot from 1423 until his death in 1444.
He repaired the buildings and strengthened the fortifications.{{sfn|Roussel|1878|p=139}}
In 1425 he built the first forges on the Bèze.
He was a "warrior monk" and fortified the abbey with walls surrounded by a moat and accessed over a drawbridge
He built a second line of walls to fortify the village.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
Around 1428 [[Claus de Werve]] made a polychromed limestone statue of the ''Virgin and Child'' for the abbey, which was installed in the Church of Saint-Martin at [[Bézouotte]] and has survived.
Construction of the fortified enclosure began in 1429.
The Chaux tower in the south and the Oysel tower in the north still stand, and carry the arms of Simon de Torcenay.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}
In 1433 there was a risk of rebellion by the lords of Château-Vilain, Grancey and Vergy against the Duke of Burgundy.
On 10 May 1433 the duke addressed letters patent to the monks and people of Bèze telling them to remain faithful to the king of France and refuse entry to any stranger or enemy. 
That year he invited the abbot Simon de Torcenay, his  councilor and chamberlain, to attend a solemn ceremony of a chapter of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].{{sfn|Béguillet|1848|p=707}}

Bèze was devastated by the war between the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] and [[Franche-Comté]], in which the Swiss invaded in 1513.
During the [[French Wars of Religion]] the Bishop of Langres supported [[Henry IV of France]] but Bèze was occupied by forces of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]].
In 1592 there were only six monks and two novices left.
With the introduction of the "''commende''" system the abbot was appointed by the king and had sole responsibility for managing the property.
Abbots, living outside the abbey, kept most of the income and granted the monks the bare minimum.
In 1615 the lay lord Charles de Ferrières was appointed abbot.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}

In 1636, as a precaution, the relics of the Abbey of Bèze were deposited with the Abbey of Saint-Bénigne in Dijon.
They were brought back from there 22 years later.{{sfn|Gaspard|1843|p=115}}
During the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1636 the Austrian army of [[Matthias Gallas]] ravaged the [[Vingeanne]] valley.
Swedish mercenaries, nominally allies of France, destroyed what was left.
The abbey was ruined, with only a few monks left, each living in a small house they had built for themselves.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}

==Last revival (1662–1789)==
[[File:Bèze Abbey in 1690.jpg|thumb|Bèze Abbey in 1690]]
In 1662 a final revival of the monastery began with the arrival of 12 monks of the Congregation of Saint-Maur.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
The Congregation of St Maur had been granted letters patent by [[Louis XIII of France]] in 1618 to manage the reformed monasteries of France.
It contained more than 180 monasteries by the end of the 17th century.
The congregation enforced a return to the strict Rule of Saint Benedict.
It is best known for its scholarship, including historical research, biblical studies, chronology and liturgy.{{sfn|Toke|1913}}
The abbey was probably partially rebuilt in the 17th century.{{sfn|Lauvergeon|2000}}
In 1731 the abbey and its revenues were transferred to the newly created [[Bishopric of Dijon]]. 
It was now administered by a simple "prior" rather than an abbot, and depended on the bishop for funding.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}

The Congrégation de Saint-Maur planned a reconstruction program for the abbey, with plans that provided more southern light and air to the monks' cells.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
The buildings and Saint Peter and Paul church were destroyed and rebuilt from 1738, using materials from the old building.{{sfn|Lauvergeon|2000}}
The initial plans were changed in 1769 under the direction of the architect Charles Saint-Père, who conceived a large building south of the church.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}
It had a central section holding the refectory and the dormitory, with two wings.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}
Of the {{convert|113|m}} long "monastic palace",  the wings have survived but the main building, which held the cells of the monks on the first floor, has been destroyed.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}

The buildings included an infirmary, guest rooms for distinguished visitors, a library that had 4,175 volumes according to the May 1790 inventory and apartments for the Cellerier and Sous-Cellerier, who looked after the material life of the abbey.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
The west wing held a large library on the second floor.
A cloister gallery runs along the central north side.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}
There is a storehouse arranged symmetrically with the west wing.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}
The church was roughly the same as the former church, but somewhat shortened and no longer extending to the river.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}

==Post-revolution (1789–present)==
[[File:Bèze - Abbaye Saint-Pierre de Bèze - 001.jpg|thumb|View from the northwest]]
At the start of the [[French Revolution]], on 2 November 1789 the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]] decreed nationalization of the lands of the church and the religious houses.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Pettegree|2007|p=4}}
The monks were turned out of the abbeys and left to look after themselves.{{sfn|Wittberg|1994|p=38}}
In May 1790 the municipality of Bèze made an inventory of the monks' property. 
The last three monks left in January 1791.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
The municipality acquired the storehouse to hold the town hall and the school.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}

In August 1791 a Langres paper maker named Faitout obtained possession of the other buildings.
After a failed spinning project the abbey church began to be destroyed around 1796 and the stones sold.
The central part of the buildings was demolished in 1805.
The former "convent house" was sold in 1804 to Frédéric Rochet, an ironmaster. 
The property then passed through several hands before being acquired by the Dijon industrialist Philippe Breuil in 1872, whose descendants owned the property as of 2014.
The forges on the Belle Ile en Bèze operated until the end of the 19th century, when they were replaced by a hydroelectric power station, which operated until the 1960s.{{sfn|Brasart|2014}}
Sheds, stables and an [[orangerie]] in the southwest were built after 1845 and a park laid out.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}{{sfn|Lauvergeon|2000}}
The English-style park was planted with many unusual trees in the 19th century and includes a flower garden with old roses.{{sfn|Abbaye de Bèze ... Association des Amis}}

The site has a total area of {{convert|4|ha}}.{{sfn|Abbaye de Bèze ... Association des Amis}}
There are two 4-level horseshoe towers from the old enclosure.
The Oysel tower to the north has had its internal divisions destroyed.
The Chaix tower to the west has a vaulted ground floor and 2nd and 3rd floors reached by a stairway in the thickness of the wall.
Of the main structure what remains are two symmetrical buildings with basements and two floors.
There is an elongated building to the east and remains of other structures including a barrel-vaulted chapel.{{sfn|Lauvergeon|2000}}
The axial chapel survives with two pilasters and their capitals.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}
The east and west wings of the 18th century convent building, the Chaux and Oysel towers including the washhouse, the floor of the old church and the axial chapel, facades, roofs and cellar structure were registered as ''[[Monument historique|Monuments Historiques]]'' on 15 September 2010.{{sfn|Ancienne abbaye bénédictine ... Mérimée}}
The property is privately owned. Both the park and gardens are open to visitors, for a small fee.{{sfn|Abbaye Saint Pierre de Bèze (4 ha)}}

A '''chapter book''' or '''chapterbook''' is a story book intended for intermediate readers, generally age 7-10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findmeanauthor.com/childrens_fiction_genre.htm|title=Children's Fiction Genre|author=Steve Bennett|work=findmeanauthor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loer"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chapter Books Lead Young Readers from Pictures to Novels|last=Loer|first=Stephanie|date=2001-04-29|publisher=''[[Boston Globe]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike [[picture book]]s for beginning readers, a chapter book tells the story primarily through prose, rather than pictures.  Unlike books for advanced readers, chapter books contain plentiful illustrations.  The name refers to the fact that the stories are usually divided into short chapters, which provide readers with opportunities to stop and resume reading if their [[attention span]]s are not long enough to finish the book in one sitting.  Chapter books are usually works of fiction of moderate length and complexity.

Examples of "chapter books" include:
* ''[[Flat Stanley]]''  (1964) by Jeff Brown
* ''[[Busybody Nora]]'' (1976) by [[Johanna Hurwitz]]

[[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] of Children's Chapter Books has included books with intended audience age ranges from 6 to 12 and up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-01-02/chapter-books/list.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ihsan | last=Taylor | title=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may reflect a straightforward interpretation of "chapter books" as those books directed at children that are long enough to include chapters.  However, some [[Publishing|publishers]] such as [[Scholastic Corporation]] and [[Harper Collins]] include the phrase "chapter book" in series titles aimed specifically at younger or beginning readers, including the ''[[I Can Read!]]'' series and the ''[[The Magic School Bus|Magic School Bus]]'' series.

'''Cleveland Orenthal Brown Jr.''' is a character in the [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] ''[[Family Guy]]'', and its spin-off series ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''.&lt;ref name="debut"&gt;{{cite episode |people=[[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]], [[Matt Weitzman]] (writers); Jack Dyer (director)|title=Love Thy Trophy |series=Family Guy |serieslink=Family Guy|network=Fox |date=March 14, 2000|season=2|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of [[Cleveland Brown]] and his late ex-wife [[Loretta Brown|Loretta]]. On ''Family Guy'', he was depicted as slim and hyperactive; however, on ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' he is shown to have undergone a marked transformation, both in terms of a significant increase in weight and a newly subdued personality. He was voiced by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]] in ''Family Guy'' and by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in ''The Cleveland Show'' and on the character's return to the former show.

At 14 years old, Junior is the only child of [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] and [[Loretta Brown]], stepson of [[Donna Tubbs]], and the stepbrother of [[Roberta Tubbs|Roberta]] and [[Rallo Tubbs]]. Junior's most prominent character traits are his laziness, obesity, and low social intelligence (although there are occasional references to him being academically bright). He has obtained poor eyesight over the years and now wears glasses. Since his parents' divorce, Loretta gave custody of Cleveland Jr. back to Cleveland and forced him to move. Thus, the pair left for California. However, en route, they decided to live in Stoolbend, Virginia instead, where Cleveland married Donna Tubbs, and Rallo and Roberta became his step-siblings.

==Role in ''The Cleveland Show''==
Cleveland Jr. is a frequent target of weight related jokes from a variety of characters in the series, in particular Rallo, his step-brother. When Rallo met Cleveland Jr. and his father he would often call them "fat". In the second episode, Cleveland Jr. served as a door in the bathroom so that he could earn his classmates' respect, which angered Cleveland. He also exudes a nervous and overly sensitive nature, and seems to have a fear of toasters as the toaster in his house scares and taunts him (akin to [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and the monkey in his closet).

It is revealed in "[[Birth of a Salesman (The Cleveland Show)|Birth of a Salesman]]" that Cleveland Jr. has repressed emotions from the divorce of his parents and has in fact never cried before. He has also revealed resentment towards his own mother, Loretta, for cheating on his father with [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] back in "[[The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire]]". Feeling bad for the way they treated him, Roberta and Rallo help Cleveland Jr. to express his sadness and at the same time the three of them accepted one another as family. In "[[The Hurricane!]]", Junior reveals that he had lost faith in God after learning from Loretta that Jesus forgave her for her affair with Glenn Quagmire that lead to her divorcing Cleveland. He also states that he [[Nontheism|does not believe in God]], although he claims he is not an [[atheism|atheist]] either, which he calls  atheism "a religion, too". However, in later episodes he explicitly identifies as an atheist without any such qualification. Yet in "[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Brown]]", he tells Rallo that he is reading ''[[Blubber (novel)|Blubber]]'' by [[Judy Blume]] because they don't have the Quran, implying that he may be a [[Muslim]].

Junior's obesity and low self-esteem makes it difficult for him to find friends. In "[[Da Doggone Daddy-Daughter Dinner Dance]]", he seems to become friends with Derek, Laine, Reggie and Kyle, although this is solely due to his agreeing to act as a replacement bathroom door as, in later episodes, Derek, Laine and Reggie continue to bully Junior, often under the lead of Oliver Wilkerson. In "The One About Friends", Cleveland Jr. creates an actual friendship with Lester Krinklesac's son, Ernie. He shared a kiss with Laura Davis at the Stoolbend Community Church's chastity ball.

While Junior is not as active as he was in ''Family Guy'', he has other hobbies and interests; he enjoys [[science]], playing the [[tuba]] in the Stoolbend High School [[school band]], and is the leader of a troop of Freedom Scouts, Stoolbend's version of the [[Boy Scouts]]. Derek nominated him for student-council president as a joke, but, after saving Oliver Wilkerson's life, he won. Additionally, while he may not know much when it comes to social situations, he is an excellent student attending Stoolbend High School along with his older sister, Roberta.

A scene in a "[[A Rodent Like This]]" suggests that ''The Cleveland Show''{{'}}s Junior has a dark double life. He reveals to Rallo that he is a secret agent who killed the original Cleveland Jr. (as drawn in the first four seasons of ''Family Guy'') in order to be placed in the Brown family. This gag is not followed up in later episodes, suggesting that it was either real or an elaborate prank on Rallo out of annoyance the latter was determined to find out what was in Jr.'s suitcase earlier in the episode that led to the top-secret organization.

Cleveland Brown Jr. is married to Cecilia, as shown in "Y Tu Junior También", to prevent her deportation.

==Character==

===Creation===
Cleveland Jr. debuted in the ''Family Guy'' [[Family Guy (season 2)|season 2]] episode "[[Love Thy Trophy]]", but only made a handful more appearances thereafter. He was presumably taken into Loretta's custody after she divorced Cleveland in "[[The Cleveland–Loretta Quagmire]]" and has since undergone a major character reinvention upon becoming a leading character in ''The Cleveland Show''. After Cleveland and Loretta's divorce is finalized in the [[Pilot (The Cleveland Show)|pilot episode of ''The Cleveland Show'']], Junior is placed in Cleveland's custody, and they move out of [[Quahog, Rhode Island]] to [[Stoolbend, Virginia]] where Cleveland rekindles a relationship with, and subsequently marries, his high school sweetheart, Donna Tubbs. His recent status is pronounced deceased as the he has abandon life support unit (LSU) in Season 10 EP 4 "The Cookie Club"  and is seen sleeping in the woods, without his life support unit he probably died during nightfall. Before Cleveland would noticed, as he and his wife Donna go out for a drink every night.

===Design===
[[File:Cleveland Jr (FamilyGuy).png|130px|left|thumb|Cleveland Jr. as he appeared prior to 2009.]]
In ''Family Guy'' Cleveland Jr. is an active child of average size, but in ''The Cleveland Show'' he has aged, gained weight, appears potentially smarter, and wears glasses. In ''Family Guy'', he wears a purple T-shirt, blue jeans and white sneakers, but in ''The Cleveland Show'', he wears a red T-shirt, blue shorts, sneakers and glasses. He is also notably shorter, as ''Family Guy'' shows him to be of average height for his age, while in ''The Cleveland Show'', he appears to be no more than 5 ft. at the age of 14.

Cleveland Jr. was a minor character who had a short time with [[Peter Griffin]] in the episode, "[[Fore Father]]", where he showed a talent for playing [[golf]]. After that episode, he made short appearances later in the show, with his last on ''Family Guy'', until 2010 at his father's supposed funeral, along with Loretta.

===Voice===
[[File:Kevin Michael Richardson by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Kevin Michael Richardson has voiced Junior as of 2009.]]
Junior's voice is provided by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], who voices other characters on ''The Cleveland Show'', including Lester Krinklesac, Julius, and P-Hound. In ''Family Guy'', Junior's voice is provided by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]].

Richardson stated that he describes voicing Cleveland Jr. as "a character he did on ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' named Patrick, who was mentally impaired and wore a football helmet."&lt;ref name="voicesbehind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20309493,00.html|title=The Voices Behind 'Cleveland'|date=2 October 2009|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the show aired in 2009, the show's panel appeared at the 2009 [[Comic Con International]], and held a discussion about the show. When describing Junior's change in physical appearance and age, [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]] said "Cleveland Jr. really didn't have much to him and so he didn't appear for a while and so we sort of aged him up and made room for [[Rallo Tubbs|Rallo]] to be the younger one for a while."&lt;ref name="ccicleveland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=22408|title=CCI: The Cleveland Show|last=Cronan|first=Mark|date=5 August 2009|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's creators later gave an explanation of Junior's altered look in "[[A Rodent Like This]]., although to some it may see unrealistic even in the context of the show (Cleveland Jr. as an operative of a crime-fighting entity run by ex-CIA agents deemed, as Junior says, "too extreme by the agency". It is even a possibility that this was all a joke, even in the program's context, because in the episode "Cleveland Live!" it is said that the characters basically run the show, and assist with the writing; this is obviously not true because these characters are fictional.

'''''Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs''''' (working title: '''''So White and de Sebben Dwarfs''''') is a ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[animation|animated]] cartoon directed by [[Bob Clampett]], produced by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]], and released to theatres on January 16, 1943 by [[Warner Bros.]] and [[The Vitaphone Corporation]].&lt;ref name="bcdb"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/7484-Coal_Black_And_De_Sebben_Dwarfs.html|title=Coal Black And De Sebben Dwarfs|publisher=BCDB|date=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is an all-[[African American|black]] parody of the [[Brothers Grimm]] [[fairy tale]] ''[[Snow White]]'', known to its audience from the popular 1937 [[Walt Disney]] animated feature ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. The stylistic portrayal of the characters is an example of [[blackface|"darky" iconography]], which was widely accepted in [[United States|American]] society at the time. As such, it is one of the most controversial cartoons in the classic Warner Brothers library, being one of the [[Censored Eleven]]. The cartoon has been rarely seen on television, and has never been officially released on home video.

==History==
[[Image:1942 Coal Black And De Sebben Dwarfs Ad.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Coal Black'' lobby card. The character designs for "So White" and her seven friends are examples of the 'darky' iconography typical of Hollywood animation during the first half of the 20th century. As a result, ''Coal Black'' and similar cartoons have been removed from circulation and are little known today among mainstream audiences.]]

===Overview===
In this version of the story, all of the characters are black, and speak all of their dialogue in rhyme. The story is set during World War II in the [[United States]], and the original tale's [[fairy tale]] wholesomeness is replaced in this film by a hot [[jazz]] mentality and sexual overtones. Several scenes unique to Disney's film version of ''Snow White'', such as the wishing-well sequence, the forest full of staring eyes, and the awakening kiss, are directly parodied in this film. The film was intended to have been named ''So White and de Sebben Dwarfs'', which producer [[Leon Schlesinger]] thought was too close to the original film's actual title, and had changed to ''Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Clampett intended ''Coal Black'' as both a parody of ''Snow White'' and a dedication to the all-black jazz [[musical film]]s popular in the early 1940s (i.e. ''[[Cabin in the Sky (film)|Cabin in the Sky]]'', ''[[Stormy Weather (1943 film)|Stormy Weather]]'', etc.). In fact, the idea to produce ''Coal Black'' came to Clampett after he saw [[Duke Ellington]]'s 1941 musical revue ''Jump for Joy'', and Ellington and the cast suggested Clampett make a black musical cartoon.&lt;ref name="bcdb" /&gt; The Clampett unit made a couple of field trips to Club Alabam, a [[Los Angeles]] area black club, to get a feel for the music and the dancing, and Clampett cast popular radio actors as the voices of his three main characters. The main character, So White, is voiced by [[Vivian Dandridge]], sister of actress [[Dorothy Dandridge]]. Their mother, [[Ruby Dandridge]], voices the [[Queen (Snow White) in derivative works|Wicked Queen]] (or rather her sweet voice and evil cackle, while for the majority of the cartoon, the Queen's true voice, which is low and raspy, is played by Danny Webb). [[Leo Watson]] is the voice of "Prince Chawmin'". The other characters, including the Sebben Dwarfs, are voiced by standard Warner Bros. voice artist [[Mel Blanc]].

Originally, Clampett wanted an all-black band to score the cartoon, the same way [[Max Fleischer|Max]] and [[Dave Fleischer]] had [[Cab Calloway|Cab Calloway and His Orchestra]] score the ''[[Betty Boop]]'' cartoons ''[[Minnie the Moocher]]'', ''[[The Old Man of the Mountain (1933 cartoon)|The Old Man of the Mountain]]'', and their own version of ''[[Snow White (1933 cartoon)|Snow White]]''. However, Schlesinger refused, and the black band Clampett had hired, Eddie Beals and His Orchestra, only recorded the music for the final kiss sequence. The rest of the film was scored, as was standard for Warner Bros. cartoons, by [[Carl W. Stalling]].

===Synopsis===
''Coal Black'' opens in front of a fireplace with a red-tinted silhouette of a large woman holding a young child in her lap. The little black girl asks her "[[mammy archetype|mammy]]" to tell her the story of "So White an' de Sebben Dwarfs". "Mammy" begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, once there was a ''mean'' ol' queen. And she lived in a gorgeous castle. And was that ole' gal rich! She was just as rich as she was mean! She had ''everythang!''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rich, [[Queen (Snow White)|Wicked Queen]] then appears, depicted as a "food hoarder", with a large repository of items that were on ration during [[World War II]]: rubber, sugar, gin ("[[Eli Whitney]]'s [[cotton gin|Cotton Gin]]" brand) and more. After stuffing her face with candies (from a box marked "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo|Chattanooga Chew-Chews]]"), she asks her magic mirror to "send her a prince 'bout six feet tall", (2 metres) but when Prince Chawmin' arrives in his flashy car, he declares "that mean ol' queen sho' is a fright / but her gal So White is dyn-a-mite!" Finding So White hard at work doing the laundry, the prince takes her hand and the two swing out into a wild [[jitterbug]]. The queen sees this and hires "[[Murder, Inc.|Murder, Incorporated]]" to "black-out So White."  The assassins arrive in a panel truck that advertises, "We rub out anybody for $1.00; [[Midget]]s: 1/2-price; [[Jap]]s: free". ([[US$]]1 would be equal to US${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|1|1943|r=2}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}.{{Inflation-fn|US}})

The assassins kidnap the girl, but after several unseen "favors" which make the would-be assassins very happy, set her free in the woods unharmed. Just before they drive off, the assassins are seen covered with So White's lipstick, an [[innuendo]] as to exactly how she earned her freedom. Wandering through the woods by herself, So White runs into the Sebben Dwarfs, seven diminutive army men in uniform who sing "[[You're in the Army Now (song)|We're in the Army Now]]," with two dwarfs singing "it takes us cats ... to catch them rats" at the end, and So White declares in a 1940s swing-style singing voice, "I'm wacky over khaki now!" They immediately recruit her as their squad cook, and she spends her days "fryin' up eggs an' pork chops too" (to the tune of "Five O'Clock Whistle") for the hungry soldiers, as a sign which hangs from her outdoor antique stove reads, "Keep 'em frying," as a sendup of the World War II slogan, "Keep 'Em Flying."

Meanwhile, the queen has learned that So White is still alive, and pumps an apple full of poison to give to the girl and kill her.  Several worms escape the apple as the queen injects it with poison, one carrying a sign that says "Refoogies."  The queen disguises herself as an old peddler woman, and arrives at the Sebben Dwarfs' camp and gives So White the poisoned apple. One of the seven dwarfs (modeled on the "Dopey" dwarf in Disney's film) alerts the others that the queen has caused So White to "kick the bucket," and the entire squad hops into its vehicles (a [[Jeep]], a "Beep," and, for "Dopey," a "Peep"). As the queen makes her escape over the hills, the dwarfs load a cannon with both a war shell and "Dopey." The shell sails over to the queen, stops in front of her in mid-air, opens, and "Dopey" appears, knocking the crone out with a mallet.

Even though the queen has been defeated, So White is still dead to the world. The dwarfs note, in spoken rhyme:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
She's outta this world! She's stiff as wood!
[[I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)|She's got it bad, and that ain't good!]]
There's only one thing that'll remedy this
and dat's Prince Chawmin' and his Dynamite [[Kiss]]!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon the dwarfs' invoking his name, the prince jumps into the scene in a spotlight and promises to "give her a kiss / and it won't be a dud / I'll bring her to life with my special 'Rosebud'", a nod to ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Wiping his lip and leaning over the girl in preparation, Prince Chawmin' proceeds to give So White a succession of highly aerobic kisses, practically swallowing the girl's face whole in trying to awaken her, but without any luck. Prince Chawmin' keeps frantically kissing So White (his efforts underscored by a solo from Eddie Beale's trumpet player), and the efforts literally take the life out of him as he first turns blue in the face, before turning into a withered old, pale-faced man, shrugging his shoulders in defeat. The "Dopey" dwarf then saunters over to So White, and, to the tune of "You're in the Army Now," lays a kiss on the girl so dynamic that not only does So White wake up, but her eyes become large as saucers and her pigtails fly straight up into the air (depicted in Rod Scribner's typically extreme animation style) as she jumps into the air.

The worn-out and aged Prince asks "Dopey," "Man, what you got that makes So White think ''you'' so hot?!" "Dopey" replies, with the only non-rhyming line in the cartoon, "well, dat is a military secret," and lays another kiss on So White, which sends her pigtails sailing into the air again and causes the red ribbons on them to turn into twin [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]s, to several notes of "[[The Stars and Stripes Forever]]", and immediately after the kiss, So White and "Dopey" both show an obvious "afterglow" in their eyes and their smile. The film then fades to the standard ''Merrie Melodies'' "That's all, Folks!" end title text, superimposed over a shot of the little girl and her "mammy" from the opening scene.

In April, 1943, the [[NAACP]] protested the caricatures which appeared in ''Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |url=https://thadkomorowski.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/naacp-coal-black.pdf|title=Memorandum to Mr. White from Miss Harper|date=1943-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |url=http://www.egusd.net/franklinhs/MediaCom/Animation1/Animation1_Term2/Coal_Black_Questions.htm|title=Coal Black Questions|publisher=Elk Grove Unified School District}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs'' is notorious for being one of the "[[Censored Eleven]]": 11 Schlesinger/Warner Bros. cartoons produced at the height of the [[Hollywood Animation: The Golden Age|Golden Age of Hollywood animation]] based on its unflattering and stereotypical use of [[darky iconography]]. Because it was produced in America during [[World War II]], there is also [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]: the firm "Murder Inc." advertises that it does not charge to kill "Japs".

The same basic stereotypical elements present in the earlier Censored Eleven films are also present in ''Coal Black'', depicted with more detail and made to conform to Clampett's "wacky" directorial style. The Prince, a vague [[Cab Calloway]] lookalike, is depicted as a slender, [[zoot suit]]ed Black man with [[straightened hair]], a [[monocle]], and gold teeth (with dice in place of the front two incisors). Both he and the dwarfs are drawn with large eyes, small noses, and unnaturally large pink lips, derived from the appearance of a white man in [[blackface]] rather than that of an actual black man. The middle-aged wicked Queen is depicted as an overweight, asexual [[Hag|crone]], with large lips that are only partially covered with lipstick (the Queen's lipstick only extends as far as it would if her lips were proportionate to her face).

Only So White escapes the extreme caricature given the other characters, although she is stereotyped in a different manner. She is designed as an attractive young woman with a voluptuous figure revealed by a short skirt and a low-cut, cleavage-revealing blouse. The sexualization of So White recalls [[Walter Lantz]]'s 1941 cartoon ''[[Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat]]'', where a young light-skinned Black woman is depicted as attractive while the other Black characters are drawn as extreme caricatures. In both that film and ''Coal Black'', the sexually attractive features of the young women are significant plot devices. In ''Coal Black'', So White is the object of sexual desire for every male character in the picture. This draws upon the stereotype of the young attractive black woman as an "exotic" sexual being, a stereotype present in roles that African-American actresses such as [[Dorothy Dandridge]] and [[Lena Horne]] played in American cinema.

Clampett would revisit black jazz culture again in another 1943 Merrie Melodies cartoon, ''[[Tin Pan Alley Cats]]'', which features a feline caricature of [[Fats Waller]] in a repurposing of the wacky fantasy world from ''[[Porky in Wackyland]]'' (during the opening sequence, the "Fats" cat is distracted by what appears to be So White). Clampett's colleague [[Friz Freleng]] directed a cartoon titled ''[[Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears]]'' in 1944, essentially ''Coal Black'' remade with a different fairy tale, and Warner's director [[Chuck Jones]] directed a series of shorts starring a prepubescent [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] hunter named [[Inki]] from 1939 to 1950. Like ''Coal Black'', ''Tin Pan Alley Cats'' and ''Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears'' would also end up in the Censored Eleven.

Bob Clampett claimed in the cartoon's defense that;

{{quote|In 1942, during the height of anti-Japanese sentiment during [[World War II]], I was approached in Hollywood by the cast of an all-black musical off-broadway production called ''Jump For Joy'' while they were doing some special performances in Los Angeles. They asked me why there weren't any Warner's cartoons with black characters and I didn't have any good answer for that question. So we sat down together and came up with a parody of Disney's "[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|Snow White]]" and "Coal Black" was the result. They did all the voices for that cartoon, even though Mel Blanc's contract with Warners gave him sole voice credit for all Warners cartoons by then. There was nothing racist or disrespectful toward blacks intended in that film at all, nor in ''Tin Pan Alley Cats'' which is just a parody of jazz piano great Fats Waller, who was always hamming into the camera during his musical films. Everybody, including blacks had a good time when these cartoons first came out. All the controversy about these two cartoons has developed in later years merely because of changing attitudes toward black civil rights that have happened since then.}}

===''Coal Black'' in later years===
The racially stereotyped portrayals of African-Americans in ''Coal Black'' and the other "[[Censored Eleven]]" cartoons led to their being suppressed from [[television]] broadcast. In 1968, [[United Artists]], which then owned the rights to the pre-August 1948&lt;ref&gt;The latest released WB cartoon sold to a.a.p. was ''[[Haredevil Hare]]'', released on July 24, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. cartoon library, officially banned the cartoons from circulation, and they have not been officially broadcast or released on [[home video]] since - even as the rights returned to Warners.

''Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs'' is often praised and defended by film scholars and animation historians, and has often been included on lists of the greatest animated films ever made. One such list, the subject of [[Jerry Beck]]'s 1994 book ''[[The 50 Greatest Cartoons]]'', placed ''Coal Black'' at number 21, based upon votes from over 1000 members of the American animation industry. Scholarly animation texts including [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]]'s ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age'',&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barrier [https://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Cartoons-American-Animation-Golden/dp/0195167295 ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age''], 2003, Oxford University Press, 978-0195167290&lt;/ref&gt; name ''Coal Black'' as Clampett's undisputed masterpiece.  Despite its being banned, ''Coal Black'' is a popular draw at [[film festivals]] and small-audience screenings, and is often [[copyright infringement|bootlegged]] for release on home video.

It was seen briefly in the 1989 [[Turner Entertainment]] VHS release ''Cartoons For Big Kids'', hosted by [[Leonard Maltin]], and in the ''Behind the Tunes'' featurette "Once Upon a Looney Tune", which is included in the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5]]'' [[DVD]] box set.

On April 24, 2010, ''Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs'', along with seven other titles from the [[Censored Eleven]], was screened at the first annual [[Turner Classic Movies]] (TCM) Film Festival as part of a special presentation hosted by film historian [[Donald Bogle]]; the eight shorts shown were restored for that release.

In [[physics]], a '''conservation law''' states that a particular measurable property of an isolated [[physical system]] does not change as the system evolves over time. Exact conservation laws include [[conservation of energy]], [[conservation of linear momentum]], [[conservation of angular momentum]], and [[conservation of electric charge]]. There are also many approximate conservation laws, which apply to such quantities as [[conservation of mass|mass]], [[Parity (physics)|parity]], [[lepton number]], [[baryon number]], [[strangeness]], [[hypercharge]], etc.  These quantities are conserved in certain classes of physics processes, but not in all.

A local conservation law is usually expressed mathematically as a [[continuity equation]], a [[partial differential equation]] which gives a relation between the amount of the quantity and the "transport" of that quantity.    It states that the amount of the conserved quantity at a point or within a volume can only change by the amount of the quantity which flows in or out of the volume.

From [[Noether's theorem]], each conservation law is associated with a [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] in the underlying physics.

==Conservation laws as fundamental laws of nature==

Conservation laws are fundamental to our understanding of the physical world, in that they describe which processes can or cannot occur in nature.  For example, the conservation law of energy states that the total quantity of energy in an isolated system does not change, though it may change form.  In general, the total quantity of the property governed by that law remains unchanged during physical processes.  With respect to classical physics, conservation laws include conservation of energy, mass (or matter), linear momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge.  With respect to particle physics, particles cannot be created or destroyed except in pairs, where one is ordinary and the other is an antiparticle.  With respect to symmetries and invariance principles, three special conservation laws have been described, associated with inversion or reversal of space, time, and charge.

Conservation laws are considered to be fundamental laws of nature, with broad application in physics, as well as in other fields such as chemistry, biology, geology, and engineering.

Most conservation laws are exact, or absolute, in the sense that they apply to all possible processes.  Some conservation laws are partial, in that they hold for some processes but not for others.

One particularly important result concerning conservation laws is [[Noether's theorem]], which states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between each one of them and a differentiable [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] of nature.  For example, the conservation of energy follows from the time-invariance of physical systems, and the conservation of angular momentum arises from the fact that physical systems behave the same regardless of how they are oriented in space.

==Approximate laws==

There are also '''approximate''' conservation laws.  These are approximately true in particular situations, such as low speeds, short time scales, or certain interactions.

* [[Conservation of mass|Conservation of rest mass]]
* Conservation of [[baryon number]] (See [[chiral anomaly]] and [[sphaleron]])
* Conservation of [[lepton number]] (In the [[Standard Model]])
* Conservation of [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] (violated by the [[weak interaction]])
* Conservation of [[parity (physics)|parity]]
* Invariance under [[charge conjugation]]
* Invariance under [[T-symmetry|time reversal]]
* [[CP symmetry]], the combination of charge and parity conjugation (equivalent to time reversal if CPT holds)

==Global and local conservation laws==
The total amount of some conserved quantity in the universe could remain unchanged if an equal amount were to appear at one point ''A'' and simultaneously disappear from another separate point ''B''.  For example, an amount of energy could appear on Earth without changing the total amount in the Universe if the same amount of energy were to disappear from a remote region of the Universe.  This weak form of "global" conservation is really not a conservation law because it is not [[Lorentz invariant]], so phenomena like the above do not occur in nature.&lt;ref name="Aitchison"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to [[Special Relativity]], if the appearance of the energy at ''A'' and disappearance of the energy at ''B'' are simultaneous in one [[inertial reference frame]], they will not be simultaneous in other inertial reference frames moving with respect to the first.  In a moving frame one will occur before the other; either the energy at ''A'' will appear ''before'' or ''after'' the energy at ''B'' disappears.  In both cases, during the interval energy will not be conserved.  

A stronger form of conservation law requires that, for the amount of a conserved quantity at a point to change, there must be a flow, or ''flux'' of the quantity into or out of the point.  For example, the amount of [[electric charge]] in a volume is never found to change without an [[electric current]] into or out of the volume that carries the difference in charge.  Since it only involves continuous ''[[principle of locality|local]]'' changes, this stronger type of conservation law is [[Lorentz invariant]]; a quantity conserved in one reference frame is conserved in all moving reference frames.&lt;ref name="Aitchison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;  This is called a ''local conservation'' law.&lt;ref name="Aitchison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;  Local conservation also implies global conservation; that the total amount of the conserved quantity in the Universe remains constant.  All of the conservation laws listed above are local conservation laws. A local conservation law is expressed mathematically by a ''[[continuity equation]]'', which states that the change in the quantity in a volume is equal to the total net  "flux" of the quantity through the surface of the volume.  The following sections discuss continuity equations in general.

==Differential forms==
{{see also|conservation form|continuity equation}}
In continuum mechanics, the most general form of an exact conservation law is given by a [[continuity equation]]. For example, conservation of electric charge ''q'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{j} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ∇⋅ is the [[divergence]] operator, ''ρ'' is the density of ''q'' (amount per unit volume), '''j''' is the flux of ''q'' (amount crossing a unit area in unit time), and ''t'' is time.

If we assume that the motion '''u''' of the charge is a continuous function of position and time, then
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{j} = \rho \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In one space dimension this can be put into the form of a homogeneous first-order [[nonlinear partial differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]]:&lt;ref name="To24"&gt;see Toro, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + A(y) y_x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the dependent variable ''y'' is called the ''density'' of a ''conserved quantity'', and ''A(y)'' is called the ''[[current jacobian]]'', and the [[Notation for differentiation#Partial derivatives|subscript notation for partial derivatives]] has been employed. The more general inhomogeneous case:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + A(y) y_x = s &lt;/math&gt;

is not a conservation equation but the general kind of [[balance equation]] describing a [[dissipative system]]. The dependent variable ''y'' is called a ''nonconserved quantity'', and the inhomogeneous term ''s(y,x,t)'' is the-''[[Divergence|source]]'', or [[dissipation]]. For example, balance equations of this kind are the momentum and energy [[Navier-Stokes equations]], or the [[entropy#Entropy balance equation for open systems|entropy balance]] for a general [[isolated system]].

In the '''one-dimensional space''' a conservation equation is a first-order [[nonlinear partial differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]] that can be put into the ''advection'' form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + a(y) y_x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the dependent variable ''y(x,t)'' is called the density of the ''conserved'' (scalar) quantity (c.q.(d.) = conserved quantity (density)), and ''a(y)'' is called the '''current coefficient''', usually corresponding to the [[partial derivative]] in the conserved quantity of a [[current density]] (c.d.) of the conserved quantity ''j(y)'':&lt;ref name="To24" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a(y) = j_y (y)&lt;/math&gt;

In this case since the [[chain rule]] applies:

:&lt;math&gt; j_x= j_y (y) y_x = a(y) y_x &lt;/math&gt;

the conservation equation can be put into the current density form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + j_x (y)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In a '''space with more than one dimension''' the former definition can be extended to an equation that can be put into the form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + \mathbf a(y) \cdot \nabla y = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''conserved quantity'' is ''y('''r''',t)'', ''&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes the [[scalar product]], ''&amp;nabla;'' is the [[nabla symbol|nabla]] operator, here indicating a [[gradient]], and ''a(y)'' is a vector of current coefficients, analogously corresponding to the [[divergence]] of a vector c.d. associated to the c.q. '''j'''(y):

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + \nabla \cdot \mathbf  j(y) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

This is the case for the [[continuity equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_t + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Here the conserved quantity is the [[mass]], with [[density]] ''&amp;rho;''('''r''',t) and current density  ''&amp;rho;'''''u''', identical to the [[momentum conservation|momentum density]], while '''u'''('''r''',t) is the [[flow velocity]].

In the '''general case''' a conservation equation can be also a system of this kind of equations (a [[vector equation]]) in the form:&lt;ref name="To24" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \mathbf A(\mathbf y) \cdot \nabla \mathbf y = \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''y''' is called the ''conserved'' ('''vector''') quantity, &amp;nabla; y is its [[gradient]], '''0''' is the [[zero vector]], and '''A(y)''' is called the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of the current density. In fact as in the former scalar case, also in the vector case '''A(y)''' usually corresponding to the Jacobian of a [[current density matrix]] '''J(y)''':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf A( \mathbf y) = \mathbf J_{\mathbf y} (\mathbf y)&lt;/math&gt;

and the conservation equation can be put into the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \nabla \cdot \mathbf J (\mathbf y)= \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

For example, this the case for Euler equations (fluid dynamics). In the simple incompressible case they are:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla\cdot \mathbf u=0\\[1.2ex]
{\partial \mathbf u \over\partial t}+ \mathbf u \cdot
\nabla \mathbf u + \nabla s =\mathbf{0},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*'''''u''''' is the [[flow velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], with components in a N-dimensional space ''u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''u&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ... ''u&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'',
*''s'' is the specific [[pressure]] (pressure per unit [[density]]) giving the [[Linear differential equation|source term]],

{{see also|Euler equations (fluid dynamics)}}

It can be shown that the conserved (vector) quantity and the c.d. matrix for these equations are respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}1 \\  \mathbf u \end{pmatrix}; \qquad
{\mathbf J}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf u\\ \mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u + s \mathbf I\end{pmatrix};\qquad
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes the [[outer product]].

==Integral and weak forms==
Conservation equations can be also expressed in integral form: the advantage of the latter is substantially that it requires less smoothness of the solution, which paves the way to [[weak formulation|weak form]], extending the class of admissible solutions to include discontinuous solutions.&lt;ref name="ToroInt"&gt;see Toro, p.62-63&lt;/ref&gt; By integrating in any space-time domain the current density form in 1-D space:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + j_x (y)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and by using [[Green's theorem]], the integral form is:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{- \infty}^\infty y \, dx + \int_0^\infty j (y) \, dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In a similar fashion, for the scalar multidimensional space, the integral form is:

:&lt;math&gt; \oint [y \, d^N r + j (y) \, dt] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the line integration is performed along the boundary of the domain, in an anticlock-wise manner.&lt;ref name="ToroInt" /&gt;

Moreover, by defining a [[test function]] ''&amp;phi;''('''r''',''t'') continuously differentiable both in time and space with compact support, the [[weak formulation|weak form]] can be obtained pivoting on the [[initial condition]]. In 1-D space it is:

: &lt;math&gt; \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi_t y + \phi_x j(y) \,dx \,dt = - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi(x,0) y(x,0) \, dx &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the weak form all the partial derivatives of the density and current density have been passed on to the test function, which with the former hypothesis is sufficiently smooth to admit these derivatives.&lt;ref name="ToroInt" /&gt;

'''Cropping''' is the removal of unwanted outer areas from a photographic or illustrated image. The process usually consists of the removal of some of the peripheral areas of an image to remove extraneous trash from the picture, to improve its [[framing (visual arts)|framing]], to change the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], or to accentuate or isolate the subject matter from its background. Depending on the application, this can be performed on a physical photograph, artwork, or film footage, or it can be achieved [[workstation|digitally]] by using [[image editing]] [[software]]. The process of cropping is common to the [[photography|photographic]], [[film]] processing, [[broadcasting]], [[graphic design]], and [[offset printing|printing]] businesses.

==Cropping in photography, print &amp; design==
[[File:vinepyrennees.jpg|thumb|right|Wide view, uncropped photograph]]
[[File:vinepyrennees crop.jpg|thumb|right|Cropped version, accentuating the subject]]
In the printing, graphic design and photography industries, cropping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the removal of unwanted areas from the periphery of a photographic or illustrated [[image]]. Cropping is one of the most basic [[photo manipulation]] processes, and it is carried out to remove an unwanted object or irrelevant noise from the periphery of a [[photograph]], to change its aspect ratio, or to improve the overall [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.croppola.com
 | title = Automatic image cropping to improve composition
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In telephoto photography, most commonly in avian and [[aviation]] photography, an image is cropped to magnify the primary subject and further reduce the angle of view -- when a lens of sufficient focal length to achieve the desired magnification directly was not available. It is considered one of the few editing actions permissible in modern [[photojournalism]] along with tonal balance, color correction and [[unsharp masking|sharpening]]. A cropping made by trimming off the top and bottom margins of a photograph, or a film, produces an view that mimics the [[panoramic photography|panoramic]] format (in photography) or the [[widescreen]] format in [[cinematography]] and [[broadcasting]]. Neither of these formats is cropped as such, but rather they are products of highly specialized optical configurations and camera designs.

=== Graphic examples (photography) ===
'''Cropping in order to emphasize the subject:'''
&lt;gallery widths=200 heights=200 perrow=2&gt;
File:Calanit004.jpg|Cropped image of [[Anemone coronaria]], aspect ratio 1.065, in which the flower fills most of the frame
File:Kalanit01.jpg|The original photo, aspect ratio 1.333, in which the flower uses only a small part of the frame
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Cropping in order to remove unwanted details/objects:'''
&lt;gallery widths=200 heights=200 perrow=2&gt;
File:Chartzit001.JPG|Cropped image of [[Garland chrysanthemum]], aspect ratio 16:4
File:Teva 17 3 (64).JPG|The original photo,  aspect ratio 1.333, the lower right part shows some white-colored trash and the upper right shows a dead flower, and both are unwanted objects.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Cropping in cinematography &amp; broadcasting==

In certain circumstances, film footage may be cropped to change it from one aspect ratio to another, without stretching the image or filling the blank spaces with [[letterbox]] bars (fig. 2).

Concerns about aspect ratios are a major issue in [[filmmaking]]. Rather than cropping, the cinematographer usually uses [[Open matte|mattes]] to increase the latitude for alternative aspect ratios in projection and broadcast. [[Anamorphic format|Anamorphic]] optics (such as [[Panavision]]  lenses) produce a [[full-frame]], horizontally compressed image from which broadcasters and projectionists can matte a number of alternative aspect ratios without cropping relevant image detail. Without this, widescreen reproduction, especially for television broadcasting, is dependent upon a variety of soft matting techniques such as letterboxing, which involves varying degrees of image cropping [http://www.filmbug.com/dictionary/aspect-ratios.php](see figures 2, 3 and 4)

Since the advent of [[widescreen]] television, a similar process removes large chunks from the top &amp; bottom to make a standard 4:3 image fit a 16:9 one, losing 25 percent of the original image. This process has become standard in the United Kingdom,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} for television programs in which many archive clips are used. This gives them a zoomed-in, cramped image with reduced ??. Another option is a process called [[Letterbox#Pillarboxing and windowboxing|pillarboxing]], where black bands are placed down the sides of the screen, allowing the original image to be shown full-frame within the wider aspect ratio (fig. 6). See [[Aspect ratio (image)#criticism|this article]] for a fuller description of the problem.

&lt;Gallery caption="Typical cropping in cinematographic and broadcast applications" widths="200px" heights="120px" perrow="3"&gt;

&lt;!-- File:Pillarboxed.jpg|Figure 6:&lt;br /&gt;A pillarboxed image, allowing the full 4:3 frame to be viewed within a cropped 16:9 widescreen --&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Additional methods==
Various methods may be used following cropping or may be used on the original image.
* [[Vignetting]] is the accentuation of the central portion of an image by blurring, darkening, lightening, or desaturation of peripheral portions of the image
* The use of nonrectangular [[Mat (picture framing)|mat]] or [[picture frame]] may be used for selection of portions of a larger image

==Uncropping==
It is not possible to "uncrop" a cropped image unless the original still exists or undo information exists: if an image is cropped and saved (without undo information), it cannot be recovered without the original.

However, using [[texture synthesis]], it is possible to artificially add a band around an image, synthetically "uncropping" it. This is effective if the band smoothly blends with the existing image, which is relatively easy if the edge of the image has low detail or is a chaotic natural pattern such as sky or grass, but does not work if discernible objects are cut off at the boundary, such as half a car. An [http://registry.gimp.org/node/16113 uncrop] [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] exists for the [[GIMP]] image editor.

{{see| Deal with the Devil}}
The [[devil]] appears frequently as a character in works of literature and popular culture. In [[Christianity]], the figure of the devil, [[Satan]] personifies evil.&lt;ref name=Kurtz&gt;Kurtz, Lester R., 2007, ''Gods in the Global Village: The World's Religions in Sociological Perspective'', Pine Forge Press, {{ISBN|1-4129-2715-3}}, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment==

===Music===
[[File:NYC West Indian Day Parade 2 Shankbone 2009.jpg|thumb|A man dressed as the devil at [[New York City]]'s [[West Indian Day Parade]].]]

====Classical Music====
The [[Interval (music)|musical interval]] of an [[Augmentation (music)|augmented]] fourth (also called a [[Diminution#Diminished chords|diminished]] fifth or a [[tritone]]) was called the Devil's Chord (Latin: ''Diabolus in musica''&amp;nbsp;– the Devil in music) and was banned by the Roman Catholic Church in the [[Medievalism|Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Devil's Chord|url=http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/94/the_devils_chord.html|work=Fortean Times|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing Limited]]|accessdate=6 August 2012|author=Brian Allen|date=July 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725115419/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/94/the_devils_chord.html|archivedate=25 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composers avoided the interval, and although it is sometimes found in secular music of the time, it was used in religious music only in very specific circumstances until the existing system of keys came into use.

The Devil is featured as a character in many musical representations from the Middle Ages to modern times. [[Hildegard of Bingen]]'s 11th-century ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'' features him, as do several baroque [[oratorio]]s by composers such as [[Carissimi]] and [[Alessandro Scarlatti]]. During the 19th century, [[Gounod]]'s ''[[Faust (Gounod)|Faust]]'', in which the Devil goes by the name [[Mephistopheles]], was a staple of opera houses around the world.

Highly virtuosic violin music was sometimes associated with the Devil. [[Tartini]]'s [[Devil's Trill Sonata|''Devil's Trill'' sonata]] and [[Paganini]]'s ''Devil's Laughter'' caprice are examples. The theme is taken up by [[Stravinsky]] in the "Devil's Dance" from ''[[The Soldier's Tale]]''.

Other pieces that refer to the Devil are Franz Liszt's "Mephisto Walzer" and Joseph Hellmsberger II's "Teufelstanz", as well as Haydn's lost opera "Der krumme Teufel".

"Archangel of Light" (another name for Lucifer) is a title song of the classical music band with the same name, by the [[composer]] Carlos David López Grether

====Popular music====
*[[Jazz]] was often called the Devil's music by its critics in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture Shock: The TV Series &amp; Beyond—The Devil's Music: 1920s Jazz|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/beyond/jazz.html|work=PBS|publisher=WGBH|accessdate=6 August 2012|author=María Agui Carter|author2=Calvin A. Lindsay, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[The Rolling Stones]]' "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]" (1968) features Mick Jagger speaking as the Devil.
*"[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]" (1979) by the [[Charlie Daniels Band]] was the first modern popular song to feature a battle between the Devil and a musician. The theme of battling the Devil has been revisited several times in other songs.{{Which|date=September 2012}}
*[[Black metal]] is a subgenre of heavy metal that is commonly associated with the devil for its use of [[anti-Christian]] lyrics and symbols commonly associated with [[Satanism]], such as the [[pentagram]] and [[inverted cross]]. 
*"[[N.I.B.]]" by [[Black Sabbath]] is a song about "the devil falling in love and totally changing becoming a good person." (Geezer Butler, 1992 documentary ''The Black Sabbath Story: Volume One'')  The song's chorus references Lucifer specifically: "..Look into my eyes, you will see who I am; My name is Lucifer, please take my hand."
*"Lucifer" is the name of a song by U.S. [[Rapping|rapper]] [[Jay-Z]] from his [[2003 in music|2003]] album, ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]]''.
*The [[Moonspell]] song "Dreamless (Lilith and Lucifer)" is about a romantic relationship between Lucifer and the demoness [[Lilith]].
*The Swedish [[death metal]] band [[Kaamos (Swedish band)|Kaamos]] has an album called ''[[Lucifer Rising (Kaamos album)|Lucifer Rising]]''.  There is also an [[Lucifer Rising (Candlemass album)|album of the same name]] by [[doom metal]] band [[Candlemass (band)|Candlemass]].
*The band [[Inkubus Sukkubus]] has a song entitled "Lucifer Rising".
*The final song on the [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]] album ''[[Evangelion (album)|Evangelion]]'' is called "Lucifer".
*Though not directly named, Lucifer is referenced in many of the [[Horror punk]]/[[Deathrock]] [[Supergroup (music)|Supergroup]] [[Son of Sam (band)|Son of Sam]] songs, particularly 'Michael' on [[Songs from the Earth]].
*"The Princess of Lucifer" is the official English title song of the [[Vocaloid]] song "Daughter of Evil"; one of many songs, by the [[composer]] MOTHY, known as [[Story of Evil]].
*Korean boyband [[SHINee]] released a song in 2010 called "Lucifer".
*Composer [[Mort Garson]] used the pseudonym Lucifer for his 1971 Black Mass album.
*Lucifer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucifer Discography|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Lucifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lewis "Cypher"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lewis "Cypher" Discography|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Lucifer?anv=Lewis+%22Cypher%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; are pseudonyms used since 1993 by [[UFX#Dunk Rock .28Duncan Lewis Jowitt.29|Duncan Lewis Jowitt]] for solo releases, including the 10-minute orchestral "Symphony For The Devil"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Symphony For The Devil Amazon|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Symphony-For-The-Devil/dp/B00ICRW5MO}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2014).

===Film and television===
When Satan is depicted in movies and television, he is often represented as a red-skinned man with horns or pointed ears on his head, hooves or bird-legs, a forked tail (or one with a [[stinger]]), and a [[pitchfork]]. When trying to blend in or deceive somebody, he is often represented as an ordinary human being, and sometimes only his voice is heard.

====Film====
Satan as a personification of evil provides many narrative opportunities. Struggles with Satan have been used to symbolize human weaknesses and temptations, as in the films ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]'' (1967, remade 2000) and ''[[Oh, God! You Devil]]'' (1984). In horror and suspense films, Satan provides for a virtually all-powerful foe.

====Animation====

The Devil has been a popular recurring character in many animated films, either theatrical shorts, animated TV series and/or in the [[anime]] genre. When a character has to take a [[moral choice]] a tiny-sized angel and devil often appear on both sides of his shoulders, representing the two possible choices he can take: the "good" path or the "bad" one. 
Demon-like characters have been featured as an occasional character in several animated series, either under the name ''Satan'' or as ''The Devil''. When the [[Hays Code]] censorship was still in effect between the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s the Devil sometimes went nameless or received a different name referring to diabolical characters from other mythologies to avoid offending religious viewers. Examples of this practice are for instance [[Chernobog]] in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' or the description of [[Hell]] as ''[[Hades]]'' in the [[Looney Tunes]] short ''[[Satan's Waitin']]'' (1954). Even though these demons and their environment were not specifically identified as Satan and Hell viewers still would make the connection based on the visual representation. Another way to avoid connotations with Satan was to make the demonic character an anthropomorphic cartoon animal.

==Devil's Dictionary==

[[Ambrose Bierce]]'s ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'' gives a [[Satire|satirical]] view of Satan as "one of the Creator's lamentable mistakes". When expelled from Heaven, he asks that mankind be allowed to make its own laws, and the request is granted.

==U.S. Justice==
In 1971, Gerald Mayo brought [[United States ex rel. Gerald Mayo v. Satan and His Staff|a civil rights action]] in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania]] against Satan and his servants, who allegedly placed deliberate obstacles in Mayo's path. In its written opinion, the Court did not deny Satan's existence, but asserted that it was unlikely that Satan was ever present in the Western District of Pennsylvania, stating, "We question whether plaintiff may obtain personal jurisdiction over the defendant in this judicial district."

In a jocular reference to ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster]]'', the court implied that Satan might live in [[New Hampshire]], stating, "While the official reports disclose no case where this defendant has appeared as defendant there is an unofficial account of a trial in New Hampshire where this defendant filed an action of mortgage foreclosure as plaintiff." This appears to be the only published legal case in the U.S. concerning Satan, and the present U.S. official position seems to be that Satan may exist and, if so, might be found in New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;http://kevinunderhill.typepad.com/Documents/Mayo_v_Satan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''''Finian's Rainbow''''' is a 1968 Irish-American [[musical film]] directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Petula Clark]]. The [[screenplay]] by [[E. Y. Harburg]] and [[Fred Saidy]] is based on their [[Finian's Rainbow|1947 stage musical of the same name]].  It is a [[fantasy]] about an Irishman and his daughter who steal a [[leprechaun]]'s magic pot of gold and emigrate to the United States, where they become involved in a dispute between rural landowners and a greedy, racist [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]]. 

The film was nominated for several [[Academy Awards]], [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe Awards]], and a [[Writers Guild of America Award]].

==Plot==
A lovable rogue named Finian McLonergan absconds from his native [[Ireland]] with a pot of gold secreted in a carpetbag, plus his daughter Sharon in tow. His destination is Rainbow Valley in the mythical state of Missitucky, where he plans to bury his treasure in the mistaken belief that, given its proximity to [[Fort Knox]], it will multiply.

Hot on his heels is the [[leprechaun]] Og, desperate to recover his stolen crock before he turns human. Among those involved in the ensuing shenanigans are Woody Mahoney, a ne'er-do-well dreamer who woos Sharon; his mute sister Susan, who expresses herself in [[dance]]; Woody's good friend and business partner Howard, an [[African American|African-American]] [[botany|botanist]] determined to grow [[Menthol cigarette|mentholated tobacco]]; and bombastic Senator Billboard Rawkins, who wears his [[bigotry]] as if it were a badge of honor.

Complications arise when Rawkins, believing there is gold in Rainbow Valley, attempts to seize the land from the people who live there and makes some racial slurs while doing so. Sharon furiously wishes he would turn black himself&amp;mdash;and, because she is in close proximity to the magical pot of gold, which is capable of granting three wishes, Rawkins does exactly that. Sharon is accused of [[witchcraft]] and sentenced to be burned at the stake unless she can make him white again.

To save his daughter, Finian tries to find the pot of gold, unaware Susan has discovered it and hidden it under a bridge. Rawkins eventually meets Og, who quickly realizes what caused the senator's change in race. Seeing that the change of skin color did nothing to alter his hateful [[racism]], Og casts a spell to make Rawkins more open-minded.

Sharon and Woody gather in the barn to be married, but the sheriff, his deputies, and the local district attorney barricade the doors and promise to burn the building down if Rawkins is not white by sunrise. Og meets with Susan on the bridge under which the gold is hidden and wishes she could talk. When she begins to speak, Og realizes they are standing above the gold.

For a brief moment he considers using the final wish to retain his leprechaun status and return to the fairy world. After a passionate kiss, he decides he would rather remain human with Susan and wishes for Rawkins to be white once more. Thanks to the now-empty crock helping to put out an accidental fire that was about to consume the barn, Howard's mentholated tobacco experiments become successful, ensuring financial success for all the poor people of Rainbow Valley, both white and black. Sharon and Woody are wed, and bid a fond farewell to Finian, who leaves Rainbow Valley in search of his own rainbow.

==Production==

===Development===
Since the musical was such a success on stage, there had always been interest in filming it. [[MGM]] was interested in filming it in 1948 as a vehicle for [[Mickey Rooney]]. However, Harburg set the price for the rights at $1 million and wanted creative control.&lt;ref name="rainbow"&gt;Deck Is Stacked Against Broadway
By Philip K. Scheuer Special to the Los Angeles Times. The Washington Post, Times Herald (1959-1973) [Washington, D.C] 26 Dec 1967: C7.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, a German company wanted to make it. In 1954, the Distributors Corporation of America wanted to make it as an animated film. A soundtrack of the score was recorded by several stars, but the film was not completed. In 1958, the authors of the musical teamed with [[Sidney Buchman]] to produce the film independently but the film did not proceed.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;VIEW FROM A LOCAL VANTAGE POINT
By A.H. WEILER. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 17 Apr 1960: X5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the rights were held by Marvin Rothenberg who wanted [[Michael Gordon (film director)|Michael Gordon]] to direct and [[Debbie Reynolds]] to star. It was announced the film would be budgeted at $2 million and be released by [[United Artists]].&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Director's First Comedy a Smash: They Told Gordon He Couldn't Make One---Till 'Pillow Talk'!
Scheuer, Philip K. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 08 Jan 1960: A7.&lt;/ref&gt; However the film did not eventuate.&lt;ref&gt;GREAT EXPECTATIONS: Or, the Annual Survey of a Few Fine Plans That Failed to Materialize
By A.H. WEILER. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 25 Dec 1960: X9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harburg stated in 1960 that he was told part of the reason it was so difficult to get a film version made was Hollywood was scared of fantasy musicals.&lt;ref&gt;Age of the Unthinking' Blamed on Broadcasters
By John Crosby. The Washington Post, Times Herald (1959-1973) [Washington, D.C] 22 May 1960: G13.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason was the McCarthyism of the period.&lt;ref name="rainbow"/&gt;

In 1965, [[Harold Hecht]] bought the film rights and hired Harburg and Saidy to write a script and some new songs. Hecht said he intended to film in nine months. "This time we really mean business," said Harburg. "We've gotten a substantial deal and participation in money and production. Up until now ''Finian'' has been making so much money on the road that we didn't want to kill the goose laying all those golden eggs. But you become more idealistic as you grow older and you tend to stop thinking about yourself."&lt;ref&gt;Smutty Nose to 93rd St.: More About Movies
By A.H. WEILER. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 07 Nov 1965: X11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warner Bros.===
In September 1966 Warner Bros. announced they had the rights and they would make a film produced by Joseph Landon and starring [[Fred Astaire]], with the aim to get [[Tommy Steele]] as the leprechaun. The budget was expected to be $4 million.&lt;ref&gt;MOVIE CALL SHEET: Warners to Film 'Rainbow'

[[Warner Bros.]] had optioned the film rights to the stage musical, and they were on the verge of expiring. With ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' having proven to be more costly than anticipated, and its commercial success still undetermined since it had not been released, [[Jack L. Warner]] was having second thoughts about another musical project, but when he saw [[Petula Clark]] perform on her opening night at the Coconut Grove in the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in [[Los Angeles]], he knew he had found the ideal Sharon.&lt;ref name=CD&gt;''Finian's Rainbow'' Original Soundtrack CD liner notes&lt;/ref&gt;

He decided to forge ahead and hoped for the best, despite his misgivings about having nearly-novice "hippie" director Francis Ford Coppola at its helm. Although Clark had made many films in the 1940s and 1950s in her native Great Britain, this would be her first starring role in ten years, and her first film appearance since rising to international fame with "[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]" four years earlier.

It was known that Dick Van Dyke was considered to play the role of Finian, back in 1965, however, financial problems caused the filming to be postponed, and Van Dyke dropped out of consideration.  (Source:  "The Films of Fred Astaire")

[[Fred Astaire]], whose last movie musical had been ''[[Silk Stockings (film)|Silk Stockings]]'' eleven years earlier, and who had concentrated on his TV specials in the interim, was persuaded at the age of sixty-nine to return to the screen to portray the title character. Given his status as a screen [[legend]] and to accommodate his talents, the role was given a musical presence it had not had on stage, and he was given top rather than the original third billing.

While a construction crew transformed more than nine acres of backlot into Rainbow Valley, complete with a [[narrow gauge railway]], schoolhouse, general store, post office, houses, and barns, Coppola spent five weeks rehearsing the cast, and before principal photography began, a complete performance of the film was presented to an audience on a studio [[soundstage]].&lt;ref name=PetNet&gt;[http://www.petulaclark.net/films/finians.html ''Finian's Rainbow'' at PetulaClark.net]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[liner notes]] she wrote for the 2004 [[Rhino Records]] limited, numbered edition [[compact disc|CD]] release of the [[soundtrack]], Clark recalls that old-[[Hollywood]] Astaire was befuddled by Coppola's contemporary methods of film-making and balked at dancing in "a real field with cow dung and rabbit holes." Although he finally acquiesced to filming a sequence in the [[Napa Valley]] near Coppola's home, the bulk of the movie was shot on studio soundstages and the backlot, leaving the finished film with jarring contrasts between [[reality]] and make-believe.&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt;

Clark was nervous about her first Hollywood movie and particularly concerned about dancing with old pro Astaire. He later confessed he was just as worried about singing with her.&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; The film was partially [[choreographed]] by Astaire's long-time friend and collaborator [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]], who was fired by Coppola during filming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdjournal.com/quickreviews/f/finiansrainbow.q.shtml DVDJournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Finian's Rainbow'' proved to be Astaire's last major movie musical, although he went on to dance with [[Gene Kelly]] during the linking sections of ''[[That's Entertainment, Part 2]]''.

Clark recalls that Coppola's approach was at odds with the subject matter. "Francis... wanted to make it more real. The problem with ''Finian's Rainbow'' is that it's sort of like a fairy tale... so trying to make sense of it was a very delicate thing."&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; Coppola opted to fall somewhere in the middle, with mixed results. Updating the story line was limited to changing Woody from a labor organizer to the manager of a [[sharecropper]]s' [[cooperative]], making college-student Howard a research botanist, and a few minor changes to the lyrics in the [[Burton Lane]]-[[E. Y. Harburg]] score, such as changing a reference to [[Carmen Miranda]] to [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]. Other than that, the plot remains firmly entrenched in an era that predates the [[Civil Rights Movement]].

Because preview audiences found the film overly long, the musical number "Necessity" was deleted prior to its release, although the song remains on the soundtrack album. It can also be heard as background music, when Senator Rawkins first shows up in Rainbow Valley in his attempt to buy Finian out.

In August 2012, Clark told the BBC Radio 4 show The Reunion that she and her fellow cast members smoked [[marijuana]] during the filming of the movie. "There was a lot of Flower Power going on," she said. &lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web|title=The Telegraph entry|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/9505840/Fred-Astaire-used-cannabis-claims-Petula-Clark.html|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Released in major cities as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow presentation]] complete with intermission, at a time when the popularity of movie musicals was on the wane, the film was dismissed as inconsequential by many critics, who found Astaire's obviously frail and aged appearance shocking and Steele's manic performance annoying. In the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Renata Adler]] described it as a "cheesy, joyless thing" and added, "there is something awfully depressing about seeing ''Finian's Rainbow''... with Fred Astaire looking ancient, far beyond his years, collapsed and red-eyed... it is not just that the musical is dated... it is that it has been done listlessly and even tastelessly."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E01E4DD1E38E134BC4852DFB6678383679EDE ''New York Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', on the other hand, thought it was "the best of the recent roadshow musicals... Since ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', musicals have been... long, expensive, weighed down with unnecessary production values and filled with pretension... ''Finian's Rainbow'' is an exception... it knows exactly where it's going, and is getting there as quickly and with as much fun as possible... it is the best-directed musical since ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]''. It is also enchanting, and that's a word I don't get to use much... it is so good, I suspect, because Astaire was willing to play it as the screenplay demands... he... created this warm old man... and played him wrinkles and all. Astaire is pushing 70, after all, and no effort was made to make him look younger with common tricks of lighting, makeup and photography. That would have been unnecessary: He has a natural youthfulness. I particularly want to make this point because of the cruel remarks on Astaire's appearance in the ''New York Times'' review by Renata Adler. She is mistaken."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19681014/REVIEWS/810140301/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time Out London]]'' calls it an "underrated musical... the best of the latter-day musicals in the tradition of [[Vincente Minnelli|Minnelli]] and [[MGM]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/66679/finians_rainbow.html |title=''Time Out'' review |access-date=2007-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507234622/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/66679/finians_rainbow.html |archive-date=2009-05-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Highly praised by all was Petula Clark, whom Ebert described as "a surprise. I knew she could sing, but I didn't expect much more. She is a fresh addition to the movies: a handsome profile, a bright personality, and a singing voice as unique in its own way as [[Barbra Streisand|Streisand]]'s."  John Mahoney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said she "invites no comparisons, bringing to her interpretation of Sharon her own distinctive freshness and form of delivery."&lt;ref name="PetNet" /&gt; In the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', Wanda Hale cited her "winsome charm which comes through despite a somewhat reactive role."&lt;ref name="PetNet" /&gt; Joseph Morgenstern of ''[[Newsweek]]'' said she "looks lovely" and "sings beautifully, with an occasional startling reference to the phrasing and timbre of [[Ella Logan]]'s original performance."&lt;ref name="PetNet" /&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' observed, "Miss Clark gives a good performance and she sings the beautiful songs like a nightingale."&lt;ref name="PetNet" /&gt;  Clearly, in the United States at least, Clark was known only as a singer, although she had appeared as an actress in British films since she was a child.

The film earned $5.1 million in rentals in North America.&lt;ref&gt;"Big Rental Films of 1969", ''Variety'', 7 January 1970 p 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
The film was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy]] but lost to ''[[Oliver!

==Home media==
The film was released on [[DVD]] on March 15, 2005. Presented in [[anamorphic widescreen]] format, it captures all of Astaire's footwork, most of which was unseen in the original release. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} It has audio tracks in English and French, with both the dialogue and songs translated into the latter language. Fluent in French, Clark was the sole cast member to record the foreign version.

Bonus features include commentary by Francis Ford Coppola, who focuses mostly on the film's shortcomings, a featurette on the world premiere on Finian's Rainbow, and the original theatrical trailer.

The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] on March 7, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Finians-Rainbow-Blu-ray/134934/ ''Blu-Ray.com'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fougère Royale by Paul Parquet - Bottle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An original bottle of ''Fougère Royale'' by [[Houbigant Parfum|Houbigant]], created by the perfumer [[Paul Parquet]] in 1882.&lt;ref name=Houbigant/&gt;]]
[[File:sa-fern.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fougère means "[[fern]]" in [[French language|French]] ]]

'''''Fougère''''', {{IPA-fr|fu.ʒɛʁ|pron}}, is one of the main [[Perfume#Olfactive families|olfactive families]] of [[perfume]]s. The name comes from the [[French language]] word for "[[fern]]". ''Fougère'' perfumes are made with a blend of fragrances: [[Note (perfumery)|top-notes]] are sweet, with the scent of [[lavender]] flowers; as the more [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] components evaporate, the scents of [[oakmoss]], derived from a species of [[lichen]] and described as woody, sharp and slightly sweet, and [[coumarin]], similar to the scent of new-mown [[hay]], become noticeable. Aromatic ''fougère'', a derivative of this class, contains additional notes of herbs, spice and/or wood.&lt;ref name=Fragrantica&gt;{{cite web|title=Aromatic Fougere|url=http://www.fragrantica.com/groups/aromatic+fougere.html|website=Fragrantica.com perfumes magazine|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name originated with [[Houbigant Parfum]]'s ''Fougère Royale''. This perfume, created by Houbigant owner [[Paul Parquet]], was later added to the scent archives known as the [[Osmothèque]], in [[Versailles, France]].&lt;ref name=Houbigant&gt;{{cite web|title=Fougère Royale|url=https://www.houbigant-parfum.com/us_en/fougere-royale.html|website=Parfums Houbigant Paris|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houbigant re-introduced this fragrance in 2010.&lt;ref name=Fragrantica/&gt;

Perfumes of this type are especially popular as fragrances for men.&lt;ref name=Houbigant/&gt; Many modern fougère perfumes have various citrus, herbaceous, green, floral and animalic notes included. The most common additions to the basic fragrance blend include [[vetiver]] and [[pelargonium|geranium]]. [[Bergamot orange|Bergamot]] is often present to add sharpness to the lavender top-note.

Examples of men's fragrances which fall into the ''fougère'' class include [[Brut (cologne)|Brut]] by [[Fabergé (cosmetics)|Fabergé]], [[Paco Rabanne]] Pour Homme, Azzaro Pour Homme, Boss by [[Hugo Boss (fashion designer)|Hugo Boss]], [[Prada]] for Men, [[Eternity (fragrance)|Eternity for Men]] by [[Calvin Klein]], Canoe for Men by Dana, [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] Pour Homme, [[Drakkar Noir]] by [[Guy Laroche]], [[Tabac (perfume)|Tabac]] for Men, Michael for Men by [[Michael Kors]], Clubman Pinaud After Shave and Special Reserve, Polo Blue and Chaps by [[Ralph Lauren]], and [[Kouros (perfume)|Kouros]] by [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]].&lt;ref name=Houbigant/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fragrantica/&gt;

The '''Foundation E.G. Bührle Collection''' (''Stiftung Sammlung E. G. Bührle'') was established by the Bührle family in [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]] to bring to public viewing [[Emil Georg Bührle|Emil Georg Bührle's]] important collection of [[Europe]]an sculptures and paintings. The Foundation's [[Art gallery|art museum]] is in a Zurich villa adjoining Bührle's former home.

==Collections==
Although the collection includes a number of [[Old Master]]s and [[Modern art]] including works by [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Pablo Picasso]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buehrle.ch/painters.php?lang=de |title=Stiftung Sammlung E. G. Bührle &amp;#124; Wir begrüssen Sie auf unserer Website |publisher=Buehrle.ch |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; it comprises mainly French [[Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]] paintings by [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and others.

==Art theft==
On 10 February 2008, four paintings worth [[swiss franc|CHF]] 180 million ($162.5 million) were [[art theft|stolen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interpol.com/Public/News/2008/woa20080211.asp |publisher=Interpol.com |title=Four masterpieces stolen from Zurich museum (ref.: 2008/5583) |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

All four paintings have since been recovered. Monet's ''Poppies near Vétheuil'' and Van Gogh's ''Blossoming Chestnut Branches'', were recovered on February 18, 2008 in a car parked at a nearby hospital's parking lot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.outpost-art.org/blog/?p=255|title = Four Paintings Were Stolen|date = |accessdate = 2015-06-22|website = |publisher = Outpost Art|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cézanne's ''"The Boy in the Red Vest"'' was recovered in Serbia on April 12, 2012.

Rotpunkt, Zürich 2015, {{ISBN|978-3-85869-664-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Buomberger and Guido Magnaguagno called for an investigation into Nazi era provenance gaps in a number of paintings in the Bührle collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/arts/international/swiss-museum-faces-a-backlash.html|title=Plan for Nazi-Era Arms Dealer’s Collection Sets Off Backlash at Zurich Museum|last=Carvajal|first=Doreen|date=2016-03-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-18|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artdaily.com/news/80983/New-book-raises-questions-about-weapons-dealer-E-G--Buehrle-s-Nazi-era-art#.WPZd7tLyjIU|title=New book raises questions about weapons dealer E.G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9868">'''''Geneivat da'at''''' or '''''g'neivat daat''''' or '''''genebath da'ath''''' ({{lang-he|'''גניבת דעת'''}}, "theft of the mind", from [[wikt:גנבה|גנבה]] "stealing" of [[wikt:דעת|דעת]] "understanding") is a concept in [[Jewish law]] and [[Jewish ethics|ethics]] that refers to a kind of dishonest [[misrepresentation]] or [[deception]]. It is applied in a wide spectrum of interpersonal situations, especially in business transactions.&lt;ref name=Levine/&gt;

The origin of the term is attributed to the Talmudic sage [[Samuel of Nehardea]] in [[Babylonian Talmud|Talmud]] ''[[Chullin]]'' (94a): "It is forbidden to mislead people, even a non-Jew." Indeed, one [[Midrash]] states that ''geneivat da'at'' is the worst type of [[theft]]. ''Geneivat da'at'' is the worst because it directly harms the person, not merely their money.&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;אנציקלופדיה תלמודית  ''[[Encyclopedia Talmudit]]'' 6:225-231. On the ranking of theft, see [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta]] ''Mishpatim'' 13, Tosefta BK 7, Hilchot De'ot 2:6. On the exception for honoring a person, such as a guest, see Hullin 94b and Tur HM 228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Resnicoff, Steven H. "Ends and means in Jewish law" JLA v.15, 2004, p.151, states that geneivat da'at is more "blameworthy... because the injury to the person is more personal and direct; it is not merely a financial injury...."&lt;/ref&gt; In rabbinic [[midrash|exegesis]], the law is associated with [[s:Bible (King James)/Genesis#31:26|Gen. 31:26]] and [[s:Bible (King James)/2 Samuel#15:6|II Samuel 15:6]].&lt;ref name=Levine&gt;{{cite book |author=Levine, Aaron |title=Moral Issues of the Marketplace in Jewish Law (Yashar Ethics) |publisher=Yashar Books |location= |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=1-933143-09-6 | quote=The prototype of the ''geneivat da'at'' personality, in the teaching of the Talmudic sages, was the biblical figure Absalom, son of King David.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

False impressions are permissible in certain circumstances, for example, in order to honor someone. For instance, one generally should not invite a guest to take from an anointing oil, while knowing that the oil container is empty. Yet, one may offer the empty oil container so as to honor the guest and publicly display one's regard for the guest. Similarly, one may offer fine oil in order to honor a guest, even if the guest is likely to refuse the oil anyway.&lt;ref name=ET /&gt;

''Geneivat da'at'' is transgressed with a statement that is technically accurate but intended to leave a false impression. While such deception often involves commercial transactions, according to rabbinic law, deception is prohibited even if there is no monetary loss at stake.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried, ''[[Shlomo Ganzfried#Kitzur Shulchan Aruch|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]'', 63:4.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the rule applies both to business sales as well as gift-giving.

A simple example of ''geneivat da'at'' would be to invite someone to dinner, merely to appear hospitable, knowing full well that the recipient would decline due to a prior commitment (a case discussed in the Talmud, ''Chullin'' 94a).

The concept is incorporated in three provisions of [[Meir Tamari]]'s proposed "Halakhic Corporate Code of Ethics" -- [[insider trading]] (even where permitted by secular law), product information and advertising, and fraudulent [[financial accounting]] reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishethicist.com/library/halachiccode.htm A Halakhic Corporate Code of Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505195051/http://www.jewishethicist.com/library/halachiccode.htm |date=2006-05-05 }}, by Tamari and Mark Schwartz.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary applications==
Writers on Jewish ethics have applied ''geneivat da'at'' to a variety of contemporary ethical dilemmas.

In [[Jewish business ethics]], the prohibition against leaving a false impression is commonly applied to advertising and sales techniques. '' Geneivat da'at'' enables ethicists to analyze improper [[selling technique]]s, such as employing a pretext to enter a home in order to make a [[door-to-door]] sales pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Aaron. ''Case Studies in Jewish Business Ethics'' 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Claims to sell at a discount may run foul of ''geneivat da'at'', when the catalog is deceptive. Specifically, if there is no [[suggested retail price]], the catalog should not claim to offer a discount based on the seller's own estimated "standard" price.&lt;ref&gt;
Rabbi Dr. Asher Meir, Business Ethics Center of Jerusalem  [http://www.aish.com/societyWork/work/The_Jewish_Ethicist__-_Devious_Discount1.asp "Discounted from what?" ]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, discounts based on misleading pretexts, such as a closing down sale when the store does not close, also transgresses ''geneivat da'at''.&lt;ref&gt;"Marketing and Morality - Breaking the Barrier" [http://www.jabe.org/marketing-and-morality-breaking-the-barrier.html Jewish Association of Business Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705083713/http://www.jabe.org/marketing-and-morality-breaking-the-barrier.html |date=2008-07-05 }} Retrieved 2-21-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the principle has been used to caution against overdone packaging, which leaves the impression of a larger product.&lt;ref&gt;Tamari, Meir. ''Al Chet: Sins in the Marketplace'', 1996 Rowman &amp; Littlefield {{ISBN|1-56821-906-7}} pp.73ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, advertising a luxury item as if it were a necessity, and any claims or even [[wrapping paper]] that leaves a false impression could cross the line set by ''geneivat da'at'' rules.&lt;ref&gt;"Advertising" [http://www.jabe.org/advertising.html Jewish Association of Business Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705083321/http://www.jabe.org/advertising.html |date=2008-07-05 }} Retrieved 2-21-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this principle, Jewish law has been applied to evaluate secular regulations of advertising. For instance, Levine argues that it is impermissible to advertise a promise not to be undersold, without comparable details of its policy to match prices. He notes approvingly that the [[Federal Trade Commission]] took action against an analogous deceptive advertising in a case against Thompson Medical Company, regarding misleading ads for a product that did not contain any aspirin.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 2000, p.198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Insider treatment and misleading shareholder information would also be governed by this principle.

In addition, ''geneivat da'at'' has been applied to other forms of misrepresentation in contemporary life. For instance, [[Reform Judaism|Reform rabbis]] have argued that the transfer of assets to children, so as to feign poverty and shield assets from a nursing home, is prohibited by this principle.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Warshofsky p.308 ''Jewish Living: A Guide to Contemporary Reform Practice''  2000 [[Union for Reform Judaism]], {{ISBN|0-8074-0702-X}}. He's referring (per p466) to Walter Jacob, ''Question and Reform Jewish Answers'', #91&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheating can also be forbidden under the ''geneivat da'at'' principle. For instance, Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] wrote, drawing partly on this principle, that [[yeshiva]]s must not allow students to cheat on the annual [[Regents examinations]] and their schools should not misrepresent grades. Nor should the yeshiva cheat on government subsidies by misrepresentions, such as inflating the number of its students.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein, Moshe. ''Igrot Moshe'' HM 2:29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Proper [[citations]] are also at stake. An author or speaker who fails to attribute [[secondary source]]s may also violate ''geneivat da'at''. Granted, if the audience does not expect explicit attributions, while it realizes that the speaker relies on secondary sources, then there would be no false impression. Nonetheless, the speaker should not rely on their own intuition about audience expectations, but rather consider only "a small, yet significant [[statistical probability]]" (''mi'ut ha-matzui''). How small? According to Levine, the audience expectation is quantified under halakhah. On the one hand, a speaker would not be required to cite sources merely to disabuse someone's rare, naive expectation that sources are cited. On the other hand, if 10 or 15 percent of the audience do indeed expect attribution, then a failure to identify one's secondary sources would be a violation of ''geneivat da-at''.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Aaron. "Using Secondary Sources Without Attribution" in ''Moral Issues of the Marketplace in Jewish Law'', Yashar Books, 2005. {{ISBN|1-933143-09-6}}, pp. 31-35&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gniezno Doors''' ({{lang-pl|Drzwi Gnieźnieńskie}}) are a pair of [[bronze]] doors at the entrance to [[Gniezno Cathedral]] in [[Gniezno]], [[Poland]], a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building which the doors pre-date, having been carried over from an earlier building. They are decorated with eighteen scenes in [[bas-relief]] from the life of [[Adalbert of Prague|St. Adalbert]], or Wojciech in Polish, whose remains had been bought for their weight in gold (shown in scene 16), and carried back to the cathedral and set up in a [[shrine]] there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archidiecezja.pl Archdiocese of Gniezno]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jadwiga Irena Daniec ''The Message of Faith and Symbol in European Medieval Bronze Church Doors,'' Chapter Two: ''Man, Flora and Fauna in the Bronze Door of the Gniezno Cathedral in Poland'', p. 23-66, Danbury, CT, Rutledge Books, Inc. (1999) {{ISBN|1-887750-95-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were made in about 1175 during the reign of [[Mieszko III the Old]] and are one of the most significant works of [[Romanesque art]] in [[Culture of medieval Poland|Poland]].

==Placing the origin of the doors==
Locating the origin of the doors has been the subject of much discussion. It is clear that their style derives from the Mosan area in modern [[Belgium]] and France. Their place of manufacture has been argued to be [[Hildesheim]] (home of the famous [[Bernward Doors]] of about 1015), [[Bohemia]], [[Flanders]] (perhaps [[Liège|Liege]]), or locally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Davies]]'s sources in [[God's Playground]], p. 65, say Flanders about 1175. For Bohemia, see next note.&lt;/ref&gt; Swartzenski says "design and wax model, Liege (?)" but "cast in Gniezno (?)", "soon after 1127", but this date now seems very much a minority view - it was the year when St Adalbert's head was "recovered", not having been with the initial batch of relics.&lt;ref&gt;Swartzenski, p.59 (note on Pl 116). [[Grove Art]], "Romanesque, §VI: Metalwork" say "c. 1135, perhaps perhaps Bohemia", and "probably c. 1170" by imprted Mosan artists in different parts of the same article (accessed January 4th, 2010). Few non-Polish sources support local manufacture, despite the Polish emphasis in the [[iconography]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that the artists and craftsmen were imported from further West for the commission, perhaps easier than transporting the single piece of the left door, either in wax or bronze form, across much of Europe. At this time the Polish church had strong links with the [[Archdiocese of Cologne]] and the home area of [[Mosan art]], which led Western European metalwork at this date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=876239 |title=Polish Art Treasures at the Royal Academy |first=Andrew |last=Ciechanowiecki |year=1970 |journal=[[The Burlington Magazine]] |volume=112 |number=803 |pages=120–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question has not been settled by the discovery during restoration work in 1956 of partly effaced inscriptions reading "me fecit me...us", "petrus" and "bovo luitinius/latinus", probably giving the name of the craftsman in charge of the casting. These mean "made by" ... "Peter" ..." of ? [place]", with the "luitinius" location probably referring either one the four [[Lutin]]s in modern Poland (not all possible candidates at this date), or [[Lille]] in northern France not far from the Mosan region, or [[Montano Lucino|Lucino]] near [[Como]] in northern Italy. If the reading is "latinus", or "Peter the Latin made me", the meaning is even less clear, but this is regarded as the less likely reading. Neither name is known in any other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?um=1&amp;lr=&amp;q=me+fecit+petrus+bovo+Latinus&amp;btnG=Search+Books first link], [https://books.google.com/books?id=ostZAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Petrus+Luitinius&amp;dq=Petrus+Luitinius&amp;lr=&amp;ei=kVw_S9O5A5e6yQT16OGLCw&amp;cd=4][https://books.google.com/books?id=P9geAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Petrus+Luitinius&amp;dq=Petrus+Luitinius&amp;lr=&amp;ei=kVw_S9O5A5e6yQT16OGLCw&amp;cd=3],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The left door (facing the reliefs from outside the cathedral) is 328&amp;nbsp;cm high and 84&amp;nbsp;cm wide, the right 323&amp;nbsp;cm high and 83&amp;nbsp;cm wide. Both are between 1.5 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm thick. They were cast in bronze using the [[lost wax casting]] technique in a mixture of copper, [[tin]] with a small amount of lead, with some fine detail being added after casting by engraving tools.&lt;ref&gt;Nesbitt, 214&lt;/ref&gt; The left leaf was cast in one piece, but the right was made in 24 cast sections which were then soldered together. Both the lion-headed knockers, which do not align correctly, were also cast separately and soldered. The doors of [[Hildesheim Cathedral]], of about 1015, had pioneered the casting of a large door mostly covered with reliefs in a single piece, which was considerably more difficult than the usual technique of earlier Italian bronze doors, which used bronze relief casts fixed to a wooden core.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 103, Cambell, 318&lt;/ref&gt; Plain doors with no figurative decoration had already been cast whole in Germany - for example for [[Charlemagne]]'s early 9th century [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Palatine Chapel]] at [[Aachen]], following Roman techniques preserved by the [[Byzantine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 318&lt;/ref&gt; The Gniezo left door follows the Hildesheim method. The relief is also typically much higher on the left door, as much as 75% on some figures, where few on the right door reach 25%.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Archaeological Journal|author=Royal Archaeological Institute (London)|date=1852|issue=v. 9|publisher=Royal Archaeological Institute|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-U9AAAAcAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Around the central panels runs a decorative frieze of Mosan-style "[[rinceaux]]", or scrolling foliage, with small figures of astrological personifications and other subjects at intervals.

Adalbert had been martyred trying to convert the pagan [[Old Prussians|Prussians]], who are shown in some scenes, giving a rare near-contemporary record of their appearance; the Prussians remained largely pagan at the time the doors were made. To illustrate the life of a single saint on such a monumental scale was most unusual at this period, and the doors are the only Romanesque ones in Europe with such a programme.&lt;ref&gt;''Volume 1 of World Art: Themes of Unity in Diversity : Acts of the XXVIth International Congress of the History of Art'', ed. Irving Lavin, p. 53, Pennsylvania State University Press, 1989, {{ISBN|0-271-00607-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-271-00607-9}} [https://books.google.com/books?ei=Wp4_S42_KZS-ywSQy9HgAw&amp;cd=5&amp;id=eLLpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Gniezno+only+Romanesque+doors+saint&amp;q=Gniezno+doors+saint Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; The designs perhaps followed a now lost cycle in an [[illuminated manuscript]] of the life of the saint, though even in this sort of works such an extended pictorial treatment of a saint's life was unusual. [[Adalbert of Prague#Canonization and memory|Two lives of Adalbert]] have survived, written around 1000, soon after his death, but no illuminated copies that throw light on the visual sources for the doors, though their texts help explain the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Nesbitt, 214–215&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the origin of the designs, the compositions show the borrowings from more common subject compositions to which early medieval artists usually resorted when confronted with a novel subject; devising new compositions was not part of their training. Some scenes adapt subjects from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' and other models. The left door shows his early life and life in Christian territory; the right one his missionary activities, apparently ignoring those outside modern Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Kłoczowski, Jerzy, ''A history of Polish Christianity'', 2nd edn., Cambridge University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-521-36429-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-36429-4}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ecdye8hk_tgC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Gniezno+Doors&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=JVc_S-HtCJfkyQSnn7xe&amp;cd=15#v=onepage&amp;q=Gniezno%20Doors&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Their iconography "clearly shows they were made as a political statement".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online (Grove), "Door", accessed January 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The only comparable bronze doors in Poland were those made in Magdeburg in about 1150 for [[Plock Cathedral]], using a much less advanced style and technique; however these were carried off during the Middle Ages by a Russian army, and installed in [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]], where they remain. Plock now has 20th century replicas in place.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 318. [[:File:515-1543 IMG.jpg|Image of originals]] and [[:File:Katedra-Płock11.JPG|Image of replicas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects of the panels==

'''''Heroes for Hope: Starring the X-Men''''' is a 1985 [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book]] designed to raise awareness about hunger in Africa. Proceeds from the comic went to the [[American Friends Service Committee]], to assist in their work on behalf of  [[Africa]]n [[famine]] relief and recovery. Published in the form of a "[[comic jam]]," or [[exquisite corpse]], the book featured an [[all-star]] lineup of comics creators as well as a few notable authors from outside the comic book industry, such as [[Stephen King]], [[George R. R. Martin]], and [[Edward Bryant]]. It also saw a rare [[Alan Moore]] Marvel Comics credit outside his early [[Marvel UK]] work.

''Heroes for Hope'' featured some memorable artist/writer and penciler/inker pairings, including [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Buscema]]; [[Stephen King]] and [[Bernie Wrightson]]; Moore and [[Richard Corben]]; [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], and [[Bill Sienkiewicz]]; [[Mike Baron]] and [[Steve Rude]], [[Howard Chaykin]] inked by [[Walt Simonson]]; and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] reuniting on the X-Men.

== Publication history ==
''Heroes for Hope'' came about in response to the devastating [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|page = 223|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Horrified by the plight of starving children in Africa, writer/artist Jim Starlin and illustrator Bernie Wrightson convinced Marvel to publish ''Heroes For Hope''. It was a 'jam' book...and all of Marvel's profits were donated to famine relief in Africa.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was in the spirit of contemporaneous [[benefit concert|musical fund-raisers]] like [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]", [[USA for Africa]]'s "[[We Are the World]]", and the [[Live Aid]] concerts. Then-Marvel Comics editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]] described the genesis of the project this way:

{{quote|One night, a few months ago, artist [[Jim Starlin]] called me at home to propose an idea that his friend and fellow artist [[Berni Wrightson]] had suggested to him — that Marvel Comics publish a special issue of ''The X-Men'', a benefit book for famine relief in Africa. Jim and Berni wanted to do the book as a "jam," with as many artists and writers contributing, which would enable us to bring a small army of outstanding talents together on the project, making it a real event. I thought it was a great idea. The next morning I pitched it to Publisher [[Mike Hobson]] and President [[Jim Galton]]. . . . Jim and Berni recruited the artists. [[Chris Claremont]] . . . quickly volunteered to recruit writers, and to help . . . coordinate the entire project.&lt;ref name="afterword"&gt;Shooter, Jim. Afterword, ''Heroes for Hope: Starring the X-Men'' (Marvel Comics, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to the contributors donating their work for the project, so did logo designer [[Janet Jackson (comics)|Janet Jackson]] and Marvel's production staff; while [[Curtis Circulation Company]] and all the [[direct market]] distributors and [[comics specialty shop]]s donated their profits.&lt;ref name="afterword" /&gt;

== Plot ==
The comic book opens with [[Rachel Summers]] poking her head out of the [[X-Mansion]] to grab the mail, only to be confronted with a horrible sight. The X-Men rush to the entrance to see that the mansion has somehow been transported to the middle of a barren desert.

After retrieving the comatose mail carrier, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] senses that all is not right, and claws him in the face. But it turns out that it was all an illusion. The X-Men go back to business as usual after this fiasco, but then things begin to go wrong. One by one, a series of psychic assaults is launched on each member of the team, as they are subjected to their greatest subconscious fears.

First [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] (with art by Byrne and Austin) is mocked by steely apparitions of his teammates. This is more than he can bear, and he curls up in a [[fetal position]]. [[Kitty Pryde]], as told by King, Wrightson, and inker [[Jeffrey Catherine Jones|Jeff Jones]], goes to grab something from the refrigerator only to be surprised by an evil Death-type being in a cloak. He exposes Kitty's great fear of going hungry. As told by [[Bill Mantlo]], [[Charles Vess]], and [[Jon J Muth]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] finds Kitty turned into a wizened old hag, which leads to his own experience, focusing on [[Christian]] imagery and moral dilemmas. Kurt is offered the chance to sacrifice himself so that one other person might breath the air and eat the food he would. He declines, and thinks himself a coward. Thanks to Moore and [[Richard Corben]], the next to fall prey to the spiritual onslaught is [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who is offered a glimpse of a world where his dream of mutant supremacy has been realized — and that it's not all it's cracked up to be. Rachel is swept back to her past, where she's confronted by a horde of mutant-hunting [[doppelgänger]] [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]], reminding her of her part in that dystopian future. Wolverine, by Ellison, Miller, and inker Sienkiewicz, must confront the tension between his human and animal sides. Claremont, [[Brian Bolland]], and [[P. Craig Russell]] depict [[Ororo|Storm]] confronted by a carnival ringmaster, who traps her in a [[house of mirrors]]. She is shown various images of her possible self, each one more distorted than the last. Ororo gets drawn into the crazy carnival games, and in the first concrete expression of the story's theme, she realizes that it is wrong to waste food. Having defeated the psychic attacker by feeding illusory cream pies to illusory people, Storm returns to her teammates for discussion of what has transpired.

Courtesy of Rachel's powers, the X-Men track the psychic presence that's been harassing them to the continent of Africa. They fly the [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] to the source, where they are met with horrible scenes of deprivation. Before long, a fleet of [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft arrive, full of supplies, which the X-Men help distribute.

That night, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] becomes so frustrated that she has not had her turn of psychic punishment yet that she decides to hunt down the entity herself. She sneaks around the campsite stealing her teammates' powers. Using the psychic powers of Rachel Summers, the Rogue hybrid traces the presence of the X-Men's harasser to a desert hideaway. Upon entering the crypt, Rogue is attacked by the avatar of the psychic being. Things are not going well for Rogue when Storm appears to give aid. The "entity" is revealed to be a primeval god-force that feeds on human despair. One by one, the X-Men awake from their Rogue-induced comas and join in the battle.

The X-Men finally defeat the entity and return to their campsite, where they resume the enormous task of feeding the starving refugees. They realize their battle with the entity was a metaphor for the fight against famine, and indeed any human struggle. Kitty expresses fear that the entity survived the battle and is ready to strike again, but Wolverine comforts her with words of hope.

The '''''Holocaust Wall Hangings''''' by [[Judith Weinshall Liberman]] are a series of sixty loose-hanging fabric banners of varying sizes created between 1988 and 2002.&lt;ref name="theclevelandjewishnews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="holocaustwallhangings5"/&gt; They illustrate the plight of the [[Jews|Jewish people]] and other minorities during the [[Holocaust]] of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="JudithWeinshallLiberman1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="holocaustwallhangings4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.umich.edu/quadrangle/spring2013/Documents/spring2013_classnotes_liberman.pdf |first=Amy Wimmer |last=Schwarb |title=Judith Liberman, LLM ’56: Remembering the Holocaust through Art |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] | accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Judith Weinshall Liberman was born in 1929 and grew up in [[Haifa]], [[Mandatory Palestine]] (present-day [[Israel]]) during the time of the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="nbcnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16156588/ns/travel-destination_travel/t/jewish-museum-features-holocaust-horror/ | title= Jewish museum features Holocaust horror | publisher=NBC News | accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, she moved to America to attend college and received four American university degrees including a J.D. degree from the [[University of Chicago Law School]] and an LL.M. degree from the [[University of Michigan Law School]]. In 1956, she turned her attention to the arts&lt;ref name="JudithWeinshallLiberman1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/judith-weinshall-liberman-54-life-art | title=Judith Weinshall Liberman, '54: A Life into Art |publisher=[[University of Chicago Law School]] | accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began studying drawing, painting, sculpture, and other art mediums at the Art Institute of Boston (then called the School of Practical Art),&lt;ref name="Libermanwebsite"/&gt; the School of the Museum of Fine Arts,&lt;ref name="Libermanwebsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jliberman.com/curriculum.html#art|title= Judith Weinshall Liberman, Curriculum Vitae |website=''jliberman.com''| accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schoolofmuseumoffinearts"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://smfa.tufts.edu/ | title=School of the Museum of Fine Arts | publisher=[[Tufts University]] | accessdate= May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the DeCordova Museum School,&lt;ref name="Libermanwebsite"/&gt; the [[Boston University College of Fine Arts]]&lt;ref name="Libermanwebsite"/&gt; and the [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]].&lt;ref name="Libermanwebsite"/&gt;

In 1988, after spending a year painting more than two dozen works about the Holocaust on stretched canvas&lt;ref name="holocaustwallhangings5"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Weinshall Liberman began using loose-hanging fabric as the background for her art.&lt;ref name="holocaustwallhangings5"/&gt; In her 2002 book, ''Holocaust Wall Hangings'',&lt;ref name="holocaustwallhangings5"&gt;{{cite Book|url=https://archive.org/details/holocaustwallhan00libe |first = Judith | last=Weinshall Liberman |date=2002 | title= Holocaust Wall Hangings | isbn=0-9719027-0-4| publisher=Schoen Books |location=South Deerfield, MA |via=archive.org| accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinshall Liberman reveals that the decision to place Holocaust-themed imagery on loose-hanging fabric was inspired by her childhood memories of [[propaganda in Nazi Germany|propaganda]] banners and flags of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]&lt;ref name="nazipropaganda"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005202 | title= Nazi Propaganda | website=Holocaust Encyclopedia | accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="holocaustwallhangings5"/&gt;{{rp|1}} that were typically hung on podiums, balconies, and walls at [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP) rallies and ceremonies.&lt;ref name="podiumanddecorativebannersofthethriedreich"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/de%7Dnspod.html | title=CRW Flags, Podiums and Decorative Banners of the Third Reich | website= | accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these banners and their [[Nazi symbolism|insignia]] promoted [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]] and [[Genocides in history|genocide]], Weinshall Liberman found it fitting to use similar hanging fabrics in her art tribute to those who suffered during the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weinshall Liberman |first=Judith |date=2007 |title=My Life into Art – An Autobiography | page=266 | isbn=978-0-9719027-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holocaust Wall Hangings are grouped into three categories: ''Scenes of the Holocaust,'' which focus on people portrayed as totally isolated or depicted as part of a depersonalized mass;&lt;ref name="holocaustwallhangings5"/&gt; ''Maps of the Holocaust'' &lt;ref name="annefrankhonored"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/news/culture/exhibitions/anne-frank-honored-in-unique-program-at-the-temple/article_90d1f222-e709-11e6-97ec-9f379b50d93c.html | first = Carlo | last= Wolff | title=Anne Frank honored in unique program at the temple | publisher=[[Cleveland Jewish News]] | accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which document the Holocaust with places, numbers.&lt;ref name="clevelandjewishnews8"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/archives/powerful-works-on-fabric-a-tribute-to-holocaust/article_d2d3ede2-ccea-50a0-87a6-7a10c3ba1bcf.html | first=Fran | last=Heller | title=Powerful works on fabric a tribute to the Holocaust | publisher= [[Cleveland Jewish News]] | accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other symbols of destruction,&lt;ref name="holocaustwallhangings5"/&gt;{{rp|1}} and a third group, the ''Epilogue'' wall hangings, which mostly explore God's relationship to the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weinshall Liberman |first=Judith |date=2002 |title=Holocaust Wall Hangings | publisher=Schoen Book | page=2 | isbn=0-9719027-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
To convey her feelings about the Holocaust, Weinshall Liberman chose fabrics ranging in height from {{convert|18|to|97|in|cm}} and in length from {{convert|21|to|172|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name="holocaustwallhangings5"/&gt;{{rp|61–78}}  She used a color palette of mostly red, gray and black&amp;nbsp;– red: blood and fire; gray: suffering and despair; black: death&lt;ref name="holocaustwallhangings5"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&amp;nbsp;– and besides the primary use of painting and [[woodblock printing|block printing]], Weinshall Liberman utilized various combinations of [[stenciling]], [[sewing]], [[appliqué]], [[embroidery]], [[beading]], and [[transfer paper|image transfer]].&lt;ref name="holocaustwallhangings5"/&gt;{{rp|80}}

Harrison of the ''New York Times'' states that within the Holocaust Wall Hangings, "Abstraction and repetition are applied to the symbolism of repression, removing it from the realm of personal suffering and elevating it to the level of universal tragedy."&lt;ref name="NYTimes-28Feb99"/&gt; Ori Soltes, art and theology teacher at [[Georgetown University]] and former director of the B’nai B’rith Klutznick National Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., believes that the soft materials Weinshall Liberman uses in her work "provide an important contrast to the Holocaust tragedy."&lt;ref name="nbcnews3"/&gt; Soltes says, "Using that kind of material for something which is so harsh and hard-edged to my mind is sort of an interesting conceptual leap."&lt;ref name="nbcnews3"/&gt; In her article "Powerful Works on Fabric a Tribute to Holocaust,"&lt;ref name="clevelandjewishnews12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/archives/powerful-works-on-fabric-a-tribute-to-holocaust/article_d2d3ede2-ccea-50a0-87a6-7a10c3ba1bcf.html | first=Fran | last=Heller | title=Powerful works on fabric a tribute to Holocaust | publisher= [[Cleveland Jewish News]] | accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; critic Fran Heller of the ''Cleveland Jewish News'' notes that "Liberman's color palette of red, gray and black symbolizes blood and fire, suffering, despair and death (and) it is both forceful and aesthetically moving."&lt;ref name="theclevelandjewishnews"/&gt;

[[File:StatueFaunePompéi.JPG|thumb|Copy of the Dancing Faun]]
The '''House of the Faun''' ({{lang-it|Casa del Fauno}}), built during the 2nd century BC, was one of the largest and most impressive [[Domus|private residences]] in [[Pompeii]], Italy, and housed many great pieces of art. It is one of the most luxurious aristocratic houses from the [[Roman republic]], and reflects this period better than most archaeological evidence found even in [[Rome]] itself.&lt;ref name="Grant1988"&gt;{{cite book |title=Civilization of the ancient Mediterranean: Greece and Rome |last=Grant |first=Michael |authorlink= |author2=Kitzinger, Rachel |year=1988 |publisher=Scribner's |location=New York |isbn=0-684-17594-0 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The House of the Faun was built in the 2nd century BC during the [[Samnium|Samnite]] period (80 BC).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cambridge Ancient History]].'' [New] ed. London: Cambridge University Press, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is evidence, most notably in the eastern walls of the [[tetrastyle]] [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], that after the [[62 Pompeii earthquake|great earthquake in AD 62]], the House of the Faun was rebuilt and/or repaired;&lt;ref name="Dwyer2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dwyer |first=Eugene J. |authorlink= |year=2001 |title=The Unified Plan of the House of the Faun |journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=328–343 |doi=10.2307/991759 |jstor= 991759}}&lt;/ref&gt;  yet, the building was only used again until AD 79, ultimately rendered unusable by the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]]. Although the eruption was devastating, the layers of [[Volcanic ash|ash]] covering the city preserved artworks, like the [[mosaic]]s of the House of the Faun, which would have otherwise been likely destroyed or decayed due to the passage of time.

The House of the Faun was named for the bronze statue of the dancing [[faun]] located, originally, on the lip of the [[impluvium]], a basin for catching rainwater; it has been moved to the center of the impluvium, as seen in the adjacent picture. [[Faun]]s are spirits of untamed woodland, which literate and [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] Romans often connected to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and Greek [[satyr]]s, or wild followers of the Greek god of wine and drama, [[Dionysus]]. It is purely decorative sculpture of a high order: "the pose is light and graceful," [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] observed,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form'' 1956:263 (illustrated fig. 145).&lt;/ref&gt; the modeling well understood, the general sense of movement admirably sustained," though he missed in its suavity the stimulus of sharper contrasts to be found in Renaissance nudes.

Archaeologists discovered an inscription bearing the [[cognomen]] Saturninus, suggesting that the dwelling was owned by the important [[gens]], or clan, Satria; a ring bearing the family name [[Cassius (gens)|Cassius]] was also found, indicating that someone of the Cassii family married into the ''gens'' Satria and lived in the House of the Faun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gordon |first=Mary L. |authorlink= |year=1927 |title=The Ordo of Pompeii |journal=Journal of Roman Studies |volume=17 |issue= |pages=165–183 |doi=10.2307/296132 |jstor= 296132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House of the Faun was initially excavated in 1830 by the German archeological institute.

==Artworks==
[[File:Alexandermosaic.jpg|thumb|left|The Alexander Mosaic]]
The House of the Faun contained the [[Alexander Mosaic]], depicting the [[Battle of Issus (333 BC)|Battle of Issus]] in 333 BC between [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Darius III of Persia]]. This mosaic may be inspired by or copied from a Greek painting finished in the late fourth century BC,&lt;ref name="Grant1988" /&gt; probably by the artist [[Philoxenus of Eretria]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' xxxv. 10.36§ 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most Pompeian pavements of the late second and early first centuries, this mosaic is made of [[Tessellation|tesserae]], and not the more common [[opus signinum]], or other kinds of stone chips set in mortar.&lt;ref name="Westgate2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Westgate |first=Ruth |authorlink= |year=2000 |title=''{{lang|la|Pavimenta Atque Emblemata Vermiculata}}'': Regional Styles in Hellenistic Mosaic and the First Mosaics At Pompeii |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |volume=104 |issue=2 |pages=255–275 |doi=10.2307/507451 |jstor= 507451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alexander Mosaic is complemented by other floor mosaics with [[Nilotic]] scenes and theatrical masks.&lt;ref name="Grant1988" /&gt;  Other notable works of art from the House of Faun include an erotic ''Satyr and Nymph'' and the fish mosaic, a piece closely resembling other mosaics in Pompeii.&lt;ref name="Westgate2000" /&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:House of the Faun.svg|alt=Building Plan of the House of the Faun|frame|256x256px|Building Plan]]
The House of the Faun covers nearly 3000 square meters and occupies an entire city block, or ''[[Insulae|insula]]''. The house can be divided into five major parts: the Tuscan atrium, peristyle atrium, service rooms and corridors, first, or [[Ionic order|Ionic]], [[peristyle]], and second, or [[Doric order|Doric]], peristyle, and their corresponding dependent rooms.&lt;ref name="Dwyer2001" /&gt;  Like many ancient Roman houses, the House of the Faun had ''[[taberna]]e'', or storefront shops, and a highly sophisticated building plan, which details the many rooms. The entrance is decorated by the [[Latin]] message “[[ave|HAVE]]”, a greeting both for meeting and parting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/|title=Perseus Digital Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other wealthy aristocrats of the Roman Republic, the owners of the House of the Faun installed a [[Ancient Roman bathing|private bath system]], or ''[[balneum]]'', in the house. The bathing room was located in the domestic wing, which was to the right of the entrance, and along with the kitchen was heated by a large furnace.&lt;ref name="Grant1988" /&gt; The servants’ quarters were dark and cramped, and there was not much furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites |last=Stillwell |first=Richard |authorlink= |author2=MacDonald, William Lloyd |author3=McAllister, Marian Holland  |year=1976 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The house features beautiful peristyle gardens, the second of which was created as a stage to host [[recitation]]s, [[Mime artist|mimes]], and [[pantomime]]s. Additionally, the house contained an entrance passage, a number of bedrooms (''cubicula''), dining rooms (''[[Triclinium|triclinia]]'') for both the summer and winter, a reception room (''[[oecus]]''), and an office (''[[tablinum]]'').&lt;ref name="Grant1988" /&gt;

==Remains==
[[File:HoFTourists.jpg|thumb|Tourists in the garden]]
Today visitors can still explore the remains of the House of the Faun in modern Pompeii, along Via di Nola. Although most of the original artworks have been relocated to the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|National Archaeological Museum]] (''Museo Archeologico Nazionale'') in [[Naples]], the most famous pieces, like the Dancing Faun and the Alexander Mosaic, have been recreated to give tourists a clearer picture of what the house was originally like.&lt;ref name="Merola2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Merola |first=Marco |authorlink= |year=2006 |title=Alexander, Piece by Piece |journal=Archaeology |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=  |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0601/abstracts/mosaic.html |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pietro Giovanni Guzzo, one of Pompeii’s past archaeological superintendents, explained, “I want visitors to have the impression that they are entering the same luxurious house in which the ancient Pompeian owners lived before it was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79.”&lt;ref name="Merola2006" /&gt;

'''''Hunting''''' (or ''Hunting Scene'') is a painting by Italian artist [[Annibale Carracci]], painted before 1595 and given to [[Louis XIV]] by Prince [[Camillo Pamphili]] in 1665.  It is currently held and exhibited at the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].

==History==
The painting and its companion, ''[[Fishing (Annibale Carracci)|Fishing]]'', were included in [[Charles Le Brun]]'s inventory in 1683, and in November 1695 they were in the apartments of [[King Louis XIV]]'s younger brother. It was no doubt for this purpose that they were given two sumptuous gilt frames, each with attributes suited to the subject of the painting – among the finest examples of the art of [[picture frame|frame-making]] in the time of Louis XIV. In 1955, when the varnish was being cleaned, the 19th century gilding covering the original gilding was removed – a task of some magnitude which was carried out by the French firm of Lebrun.&lt;ref&gt;H. Loyrette, ''The Louvre: All the Paintings'', Black Dog &amp; Leventhal (2011), ''s.v. Carracci''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This work, together with its companion, date from Carracci's [[Bologna|Bolognese]] period, before he left for [[Rome]] in 1595 to paint at the [[Palazzo Farnese|Galleria Farnese]]. At this time he was extremely interested in [[landscape]], and his experiments are a foreshadowing of [[Poussin]]'s classical compositions; but in these pictures he is exploring in a different direction, in the tradition of the [[Bassano (disambiguation)#Visual_arts|Bassani]], a family of painters whose studios continued to turn out landscapes which were prized all over [[Europe]]. His interest was the [[countryside]]. Without any religious theme as pretext, he painted two pure landscapes whose true subjects are the forest and the river, motivated by the themes of [[hunting]] and [[fishing]]. Therefore Carracci was able to show nature animated with the life of the [[aristocracy]] and of ordinary people. The composition follows the visual device of division into compartments.&lt;ref&gt;H. Loyrette, ''ibid.'',  Ch.I, ''Italian School''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Annibale Carracci - Fishing - WGA4414.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[Fishing (Annibale Carracci)|Fishing Scene]]'' by [[Annibale Carracci]] (before 1595),1.36 m x 2.53m]]

Along with the Galleria Farnese, these two thematic paintings are among Carracci's masterpieces, and have always been much admired by artists. [[Manet]] found inspiration in the ''[[Fishing (Annibale Carracci)|Fishing]]'', and the ''Hunting'' has been copied by [[Matisse]], [[Edvard Munch]] and [[Rouault]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Benati &amp; E. Riccomini, ''Annibale Carracci'', [[Mondadori]] Electa (2006), ''s.v. "Fishing Scene"''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex''''' is a book by American writer [[Nathaniel Philbrick]] about the loss of the [[whaler]] [[Essex (1799 whaleship)|''Essex'']] in the Pacific Ocean in 1820. The book was published by [[Viking Press]] on May 8, 2000, and won the 2000 [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]]. It was adapted into a [[In the Heart of the Sea (film)|film of the same name]], which came out in late 2015.

==Summary==
The ''[[Essex (1799 whaleship)|Essex]]'', an American [[whaleship]] from [[Nantucket]], [[Massachusetts]], sank after a [[sperm whale]] attacked it in the [[Pacific Ocean]] in November 1820. Having lost their ship, the crew of the ''Essex'' attempted to sail to [[South America]] in [[whaleboat]]s. After suffering from starvation and dehydration, most of the crew died before the survivors were rescued in February 1821.

In retelling the story of the crew's ordeal, Philbrick utilizes an account written by [[Thomas Nickerson]], who was a teenage [[cabin boy]] on board the ''Essex'' and wrote about the experience in his old age; his account was lost until 1960 but was not authenticated until 1980 before being published, abridged, in 1984. The book also utilizes the better known account of [[Owen Chase]], the ship's [[first mate]], which was published soon after the ordeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | title = In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex  | author = Philbrick, Nathaniel  | publisher = Penguin Books  | year = 2001  | isbn = 0-14-100182-8  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jcarV199NhkC&amp;printsec=frontcover  | pages=xiv-xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DurhamCassiodorusDavidVictor.JPG|thumb|[[David]] from the [[Durham Cassiodorus]], early 8th century, ?Jarrow&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, 29, 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Insular art''', also known as '''Hiberno-Saxon art''', is the style of art produced in the [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman history]] of [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]]. The term derives from ''insula'', the [[Latin language|Latin]] term for "island"; in this period Britain and Ireland shared a largely common style different from that of the rest of Europe. Art historians usually group insular art as part of the [[Migration Period art]] movement as well as Early Medieval Western art, and it is the combination of these two traditions that gives the style its special character.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 244–247; Pächt, 65–66; Walies &amp; Zoll, 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Insular art originates from the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish monastic]] movement of [[Celtic Christianity]], or metalwork for the secular elite, and the period begins around 600 with the combining of [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] styles. One major distinctive feature is [[interlace (art)|interlace]] decoration, in particular the [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]] decoration as found at [[Sutton Hoo]], in [[East Anglia]], which is now applied to decorating new types of objects mostly copied from the Mediterranean world, above all the [[codex]] or book.&lt;ref&gt;No manuscripts are commonly dated before 600, but some jewellery, mostly Irish, is dated to the 6th century. Youngs 20–22. The early history of Anglo-Saxon metalwork is dominated by the early-7th-century finds at [[Sutton Hoo]], but it is clear these were the product of a well-established tradition of which only smaller pieces survive. Wilson, 16–27. The earliest Pictish stones may date from the fifth century however. Laing, 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The finest period of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the [[Viking expansion|Viking raids]] which began in the late 8th century.  These are presumed to have interrupted work on the [[Book of Kells]], and no later Gospel books are as heavily or finely illuminated as the masterpieces of the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 85, 90; Wilson, 141&lt;/ref&gt; In England the style merged into [[Anglo-Saxon art]] around 900, whilst in Ireland the style continued until the 12th century, when it merged into [[Romanesque art]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland, [[Scotland]] and the kingdom of [[Northumbria]] in northern England are the most important centres, but examples were found also in southern England, Wales&lt;ref&gt;The late [[Ricemarch Psalter]] is certainly Welsh in origin, and the much earlier [[Hereford Gospels]] is believed by many to be Welsh (see Grove Art Online, S2); the 10th-century [[Book of Deer]], the earliest manuscript with [[Scottish Gaelic]], is an Insular product of eastern Scotland (Grove).&lt;/ref&gt; and in Continental Europe, especially [[Gaul]] (modern France), in centres founded by the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] and Anglo-Saxon missions. The influence of insular art affected all subsequent European medieval art, especially in the decorative elements of Romanesque and Gothic manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving examples of Insular art are mainly [[illuminated manuscript]]s, metalwork and carvings in stone, especially [[High cross|stone crosses]].  Surfaces are highly decorated with intricate patterning, with no attempt to give an impression of depth, volume or recession.  The best examples include the [[Book of Kells]], [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], [[Book of Durrow]], brooches such as the [[Tara Brooch]] and the [[Ruthwell Cross]]. [[Carpet pages]] are a characteristic feature of Insular manuscripts, although [[historiated initial]]s (an Insular invention), [[canon table]]s and figurative miniatures, especially [[Evangelist portrait]]s, are also common.

==Use of the term==
The term was derived from its use for [[Insular script]], first cited by the ''[[OED]]'' in 1908,&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] "Insular" 4 b., though as it seems clear from their 1908 quotation that the use of the term was already established; [[Carola Hicks]] dates the first use to 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; and is also used for the group of [[Insular Celtic languages]] by linguists.&lt;ref&gt;Apparently a more recent usage from the ?1970s on, in works such as {{cite book| last=Cowgill |first=Warren |authorlink=Warren Cowgill |year=1975 |chapter=The origins of the Insular Celtic conjunct and absolute verbal endings |editor=H. Rix (ed.) |title=Flexion und Wortbildung: Akten der V. Fachtagung der Indogermanischen Gesellschaft, Regensburg, 9.–14. September 1973 |location=Wiesbaden |pages=40–70 |publisher=Reichert |isbn=978-3-920153-40-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially used mainly to describe the style of decoration of illuminated manuscripts, which are certainly the most numerous type of major surviving objects using the style, it is now used more widely across all the arts.  It has the advantage of recognising the unity of styles across the Britain and Ireland, while avoiding the use of the term ''[[British Isles]]'', a sensitive topic in Ireland, and also circumventing arguments about the origins of the style, and the place of creation of specific works, which were often fierce in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 225–241, Nordenfalk, 11–14, Wailes &amp; Zoll, 25–38, Wilson, 32–36, give accounts of some of these scholarly controversies; [[Oxford Art Online]] "Insular art", [http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/insular-art The Oxford Dictionary of Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905081448/http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/insular-art |date=5 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources distinguish between a "wider period between the 5th and 11th centuries, from the departure of the Romans to the beginnings of the Romanesque style" and a "more specific phase from the 6th to 9th centuries, between the conversion to Christianity and the Viking settlements".&lt;ref&gt;Hicks&lt;/ref&gt; C. R. Dodwell, on the other hand, says that in Ireland "the Insular style continued almost unchallenged until the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Anglo-Norman invasion of 1170]]; indeed examples of it occur even as late as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insular decoration==
[[File:KellsDecoratedInitial.jpg|thumb|right|One of hundreds of small initials from the ''Book of Kells'']]
The Insular style is most famous for its highly dense, intricate and imaginative decoration, which takes elements from several earlier styles.  Late [[Iron Age]] Celtic art or "Ultimate [[La Tène style|La Tène]]", gave the love of spirals, [[triskele]]s, circles and other geometric motifs. These were combined with animal forms probably mainly deriving from the Germanic version of the general [[Eurasia]]n [[animal style]], though also from Celtic art, where heads terminating scrolls were common. [[Interlace (visual arts)|Interlace]] was used by both these traditions, as well as Roman art (for example in floor [[mosaic]]s) and other possible influences such as [[Coptic art]], and its use was taken to new levels in insular art, where it was combined with the other elements already mentioned.  There is no attempt to represent depth in manuscript painting, with all the emphasis on a brilliantly patterned surface.  In early works the human figure was shown in the same geometric fashion as animal figures, but reflections of a classical figure style spread as the period went on, probably mostly from the southern Anglo-Saxon regions, though northern areas also had direct contacts with the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, Wilson, 38–40, Nordenfalk, 13–26, Calkins Chapter 1, Laing 346–351&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the overall format of the carpet page have often been related to Roman floor mosaics,&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 97–100&lt;/ref&gt; Coptic carpets and manuscript paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, 19–22, Schapiro, 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; without general agreement being reached among scholars.

==Background==
[[File:Sutton.Hoo.ShoulderClasp2.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|Early Anglo-Saxon shoulder-clasps from [[Sutton Hoo]], early 7th century. Gold, garnet, and [[millefiori]] glass.]]
Unlike contemporary [[Byzantine art]], and that of most major periods, insular art does not come from a society where common stylistic influences were spread across a great number of types of object in art, [[applied art]] and [[decorative art]].  Across all the islands society was effectively entirely rural, buildings were rudimentary, and architecture has no Insular style.  Although related objects in many more perishable media certainly existed and have not survived, it is clear that both religious and secular Insular patrons expected individual objects of dazzling virtuousity, that were all the more dazzling because of the lack of visual sophistication in the world in which they were seen.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 48–55, Dodwell, 19 and throughout Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in Ireland, the clerical and secular elites were often very closely linked; some Irish [[Abbot|abbacies]] were held for generations among a small kin-group.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland was divided into very small "kingdoms", almost too many for historians to keep track of, whilst in Britain there was a smaller number of generally larger kingdoms. Both the Celtic (Irish and [[Pict]]ish) and Anglo-Saxon elites had long traditions of metalwork of the finest quality, much of it used for the personal adornment of both sexes of the elite. The Insular style arises from the meeting of their two styles, Celtic and Anglo-Saxon [[animal style]], in a Christian context, and with some awareness of Late Antique style. This was especially so in their application to the book, which was a new type of object for both traditions, as well as to metalwork.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 15–16, 72; Nordenfalk, 7–11, Pächt, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the [[Kingdom of Northumbria]] in the formation of the new style appears to have been pivotal.  The northernmost Anglo-Saxon kingdom continued to expand into areas with Celtic populations, but often leaving those populations largely intact in areas such as [[Dál Riata]], [[Elmet]] and the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]]. The Irish monastery at [[Iona]] was established by Saint [[Columba]] (Colum Cille) in 563, when Iona was part of a Dál Riata that included territory in both Ireland and modern Scotland. Although the first conversion of a Northumbrian king, that of [[Edwin of Northumbria|Edwin]] in 627, was effected by clergy from the [[Gregorian Mission]] to Kent, it was the [[Celtic Christianity]] of Iona that was initially more influential in Northumbria, founding [[Lindisfarne]] on the eastern coast as a satellite in 635.  However Northumbria remained in direct contact with Rome and other important monastic centres were founded by [[Wilfrid]] and [[Benedict Biscop]] who looked to Rome, and at the [[Synod of Whitby]] it was the Roman practices that were upheld, while the Iona contingent walked out, not adopting the Roman Easter dating until 715.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, 8–9; Schapiro, 167–173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insular metalwork==
[[File:Derrynaflan paten.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Derrynaflan paten]], 8th or 9th century.]]
Christianity discouraged the burial of grave goods so that, at least from the Anglo-Saxons, we have a larger number of pre-Christian survivals than those from later periods.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 4&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of examples that survive from the Christian period have been found in archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable [[shrine]]s ("[[cumdach]]s") for books or [[relic]]s, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the [[Monymusk Reliquary]] has always been in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 134–140 catalogues two examples from Italy and one from Norway. See also Laing, who describes major pieces by period and area at various points.&lt;/ref&gt; In general it is clear that most survivals are only by chance, and that we have only fragments of some types of object—in particular the largest and least portable. The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, or tableware or altarware in what were apparently very similar styles—some pieces cannot be confidently assigned between altar and royal dining-table.  It seems possible, even likely, that the finest church pieces were made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 15–16, 125&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence suggests that Irish metalworkers produced most of the best pieces,&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 53&lt;/ref&gt; however the finds from the royal burial at [[Sutton Hoo]], from the far east of England and at the beginning of the period, are as fine in design and workmanship as any Irish pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 16–25&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ardagh chalice.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ardagh Chalice]], c.? 750]]

There are a number of large brooches, including several of comparable quality to the [[Tara brooch]].  Almost all of these are in the [[National Museum of Ireland]], the [[British Museum]], the [[National Museum of Scotland]], or local museums in the islands.  Each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied in technique and superb in quality.  Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts.  Almost all of the many techniques known in metalwork can be found in Insular work.  Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with [[amber]] and [[rock crystal]] among the commonest, and some [[garnet]]s.  Coloured glass, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[millefiori]] glass, probably imported, are also used.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 72–115, and 170–174 on techniques; Ryan, Michael in [[Oxford Art Online]], S2, Wilson, 113–114, 120–130&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ardagh Chalice]] and the [[Derrynaflan Chalice|Derrynaflan]] Hoard of chalice, [[paten]] with stand, strainer, and basin (only discovered in 1980) are the most outstanding pieces of church metalware to survive (only three other chalices, and no other paten, survive).  These pieces are thought to come from the 8th or 9th century, but most dating of metalwork is uncertain, and comes largely from comparison with manuscripts.  Only fragments remain from what were probably large pieces of church furniture, probably with metalwork on wooden frameworks, such as shrines, crosses and other items.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 125–130, and catalogue entries following, including the Derrynaflan Hoard.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cross of Cong]] is a 12th-century Irish processional cross and [[reliquary]] that shows insular decoration, possibly added in a deliberately revivalist spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Rigby, 562&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gilt-bronze]] "[[Athlone]] Crucifixion Plaque" ([[National Museum of Ireland]], perhaps 8th century) is much the best known of a group of nine recorded Irish metal plaques with ''Crucifixions'', and is comparable in style to figures on many high crosses; it may well have come from a book cover.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ruth. ''Irish Crucifixion Plaques: Viking Age or Romanesque?'', The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Vol. 128, (1998), pp. 95–106. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25549845 JSTOR]. [http://gravelwalks.com/files/Bronze_Plaque_from_Athlone.jpg Image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711123122/http://gravelwalks.com/files/Bronze_Plaque_from_Athlone.jpg |date=11 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fittings of a major abbey church in the insular period remain hard to imagine; one thing that does seem clear is that the most fully decorated manuscripts were treated as decorative objects for display rather than as books for study.  The most fully decorated of all, the Book of Kells, has several mistakes left uncorrected, the text headings necessary to make the Canon tables usable have not been added, and when it was stolen in 1006 for its cover in precious metals, it was taken from the [[sacristy]], not the library.  The book was recovered, but not the cover, as also happened with the Book of Lindisfarne.  None of the major insular manuscripts have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but we know from documentary evidence that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins 57–60. The 8th-century pocket gospel book [[Book of Dimma]] has a fine 12th-century cover.&lt;/ref&gt; The re-used metal back cover of the [[Lindau Gospels]] (now in the [[Morgan Library]], New York&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collections.asp?id=70|title=Gospel Book|author=|date=13 July 2017|website=themorgan.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709172139/http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collections.asp?id=70|archivedate=9 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was made in southern Germany in the late 8th or early 9th? century, under heavy insular influence, and is perhaps the best indication as to the appearance of the original covers of the great insular manuscripts, although one gold and garnet piece from the Anglo-Saxon [[Staffordshire Hoard]], found in 2009, may be the corner of a book-cover.  The Lindau design is dominated by a cross, but the whole surface of the cover is decorated, with interlace panels between the arms of the cross.  The [[cloisonné]] enamel shows Italian influence, and is not found in work from the Insular homelands, but the overall effect is very like a carpet page.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 8–9, and plate 2; [http://www.themorgan.org/collections/collections.asp?id=67 Lindau Gospels cover] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613042530/http://themorgan.org/collections/collections.asp?id=67 |date=13 June 2010 }}, from Morgan Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insular manuscripts==
[[File:CathachOfStColumba.jpg|thumb|upright|Cathach of St. Columba, 7th century]]
{{main|Insular illumination}}
Although many more examples survive than of large pieces of metalwork, the development of the style is usually described in terms of the same outstanding examples:

'''[[Cathach of St. Columba]]'''.
An Irish Latin [[psalter]] of the early 7th century,&lt;ref&gt;Or "the second half of the sixth century" according to Schapiro, 229. Calkins, 31–32 gives no date, Nordenfalk, 12–13 says 7th century.&lt;/ref&gt; this is perhaps the oldest known Irish manuscript of any sort.  It contains only decorated letters, at the beginning of each Psalm, but these already show distinctive traits.  Not just the initial, but the first few letters are decorated, at diminishing sizes.  The decoration influences the shape of the letters, and various decorative forms are mixed in a very unclassical way. Lines are already inclined to spiral and metamorphose, as in the example shown. Apart from black, some orange ink is used for dotted decoration.  The classical tradition was late to use capital letters for initials at all (in Roman texts it is often very hard to even separate the words), and though by this time they were in common use in Italy, they were often set in the left margin, as though to cut them off from the rest of the text.  The insular tendency for the decoration to lunge into the text, and take over more and more of it, was a radical innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Pächt, 63–64, in his chapter on the initial, which gives a thorough treatment of the subject. Nordenfalk, 12–13 has other images.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bobbio Jerome]] which according to an inscription dates to before 622, from [[Bobbio Abbey]], an Irish mission centre in northern Italy, has a more elaborate initial with colouring, showing Insular characteristics still more developed, even in such an outpost. From the same [[scriptorium]] and of similar date, the [[Bobbio Orosius]] has the earliest [[carpet page]], although a relatively simple one.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 227–229; Wilson, 60&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BookOfDurrowBeginMarkGospel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The beginning of the Gospel of Mark from the Book of Durrow.]]

'''[[Gospel Book Fragment (Durham Cathedral Library, A. II. 10.)|Durham Gospel Book Fragment]]'''.
The earliest painted Insular manuscript to survive, produced in [[Lindisfarne]] c. 650, but with only seven leaves of the book remaining, not all with illuminations. This introduces interlace, and also uses Celtic motifs drawn from metalwork. The design of two of the surviving pages relates them as a two-page spread&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 32–33; Nordenfalk, 14–15, 28, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Book of Durrow]]'''.
The earliest surviving Gospel Book with a full programme of decoration (though not all has survived): six extant carpet pages, a full-page miniature of the four evangelist's symbols, four full-page miniatures of the evangelists' symbols, four pages with very large initials, and decorated text on other pages.  Many minor initial groups are decorated.  Its date and place of origin remain subjects of debate, with 650–690 and [[Durrow, County Offaly|Durrow]] in Ireland, [[Iona]] or [[Lindisfarne]] being the normal contenders.  The influences on the decoration are also highly controversial, especially regarding [[Copt]]ic or other Near Eastern influence.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 33–63 gives a full account with many illustrations; Nordenfalk, 34–47, and 19–22 on Coptic influences; see also Schapiro Index (under Dublin), Wilson, 32–36 and index.&lt;/ref&gt;

After large initials the following letters on the same line, or for some lines beyond, continue to be decorated at a smaller size.  Dots round the outside of large initials are much used.  The figures are highly stylised, and some pages use Germanic interlaced animal ornament, whilst others use the full repertoire of Celtic geometric spirals. Each page uses a different and coherent set of decorative motifs. Only four colours are used, but the viewer is hardly conscious of any limitation from this.  All the elements of Insular manuscript style are already in place. The execution, though of high quality, is not as refined as in the best later books, nor is the scale of detail as small.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 33–63 gives a full account with many illustrations; Nordenfalk, 34–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meister des Book of Lindisfarne 002.jpg|thumb|right|Carpet page from the Lindisfarne Gospels]]
'''[[Lindisfarne Gospels]]'''
Produced in Lindisfarne by [[Eadfrith]], [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]], between about 690 and his death in 721 (perhaps towards the end of this period), this is a Gospel Book in the style of the Book of Durrow, but more elaborate and complex.  All the letters on the pages beginning the Gospels are highly decorated in a single composition, and many two-page openings are designed as a unit, with carpet pages facing an ''incipit'' ("Here begins..") initial page at the start of each Gospel.  Eadfrith was almost certainly the scribe as well as the artist.  There are four [[Evangelist portrait]]s, clearly derived from the classical tradition but treated without any sense of depth; the borders around them are far plainer than the decoration of the text pages, and there is clearly a sense of two styles which Eadfrith does not attempt to integrate wholly.  The carpet-pages are enormously complex, and superbly executed.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 63–78; Nordenfalk, 60–75&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Lichfield Gospels]]'''
Likely made in Lichfield around 730, this deluxe gospel-book contains eight major decorated pages, including a stunning cross-carpet page and portraits of the evangelists Mark and Luke. The gospels of Matthew and Mark and the beginning of Luke survives. From its time in Wales, pages include marginalia representing some of the earliest examples of Old Welsh writing. The manuscript has been at [[Lichfield Cathedral]] since the late 10th century, except for a brief period during the English Civil War. 

'''[[St Petersburg Bede]]'''.
Attributed to [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey]] in Northumbria between about 730–746, this contains larger opening letters in which metalwork styles of decoration can clearly be seen. There are thin bands of interlace within the members of letters. It also contains the earliest [[historiated initial]], a bust probably of [[Pope Gregory I]], which like some other elements of the decoration, clearly derives from a Mediterranean model.  Colour is used, although in a relatively restrained way.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 199–224; Wilson, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Book of Kells]]'''
Usually dated to around 800, although sometimes up to a century earlier, the place of origin is disputed between Iona and [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], or other locations.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 84&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often thought to have been begun in Iona and then continued in Ireland, after disruption from [[Viking]] raids; the book survives nearly intact but the decoration is not finished, with some parts in outline only.  It is far more comprehensively decorated than any previous manuscript in any tradition, with every page (except two) having many small decorated letters.  Although there is only one carpet page, the ''incipit'' initials are so densely decorated, with only a few letters on the page, that they rather take over this function.  Human figures are more numerous than before, though treated in a thoroughly stylised fashion, and closely surrounded, even hemmed in, by decoration as crowded as on the initial pages.  A few scenes such as the ''Temptation'' and ''Arrest of Christ'' are included, as well as a Madonna and Child, surrounded by angels (the earliest Madonna in a Western book).  More miniatures may have been planned or executed and lost.  Colours are very bright and the decoration has tremendous energy, with spiral forms predominating.  Gold and silver are not used.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 78–92; Nordenfalk, 108–125&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other books===
[[File:BookMullingFol193StJohnPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|St John from the Book of Mulling]]
A distinctive Insular type of book is the '''pocket gospel book''', inevitably much less decorated, but in several cases with Evangelist portraits and other decoration.  Examples include the [[Book of Mulling]], [[Book of Deer]], [[Book of Dimma]], and the smallest of all, the [[Stonyhurst Gospel]] (now [[British Library]]), a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon text of the Gospel of John, which belonged to [[St Cuthbert]] and was buried with him.  Its beautifully tooled goatskin cover is the oldest Western bookbinding to survive, and a virtually unique example of insular leatherwork, in an excellent state of preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Bloxham &amp; Rose, and [http://faculty.luther.edu/~martinka/art43/daily/2nd/ston.jpg images] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125092823/http://faculty.luther.edu/~martinka/art43/daily/2nd/ston.jpg |date=25 November 2005 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Anglo-Saxon and Irish manuscripts have a distinctive rougher finish to their vellum, compared to the smooth-polished surface of contemporary continental and all late-medieval vellum.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 32&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that, in contrast to later periods, the scribes copying the text were often also the artists of the illuminations, and might include the most senior figures of their monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 9 and 72. The tradition that St [[Cuthbert]] copied the Stonyhurst Gospel himself may be correct, though that attributing the Book of Kells to St [[Columba]] himself seems impossible.  For other high-ranking Anglo-Saxon monastic artists see [[Eadfrith of Lindisfarne]], [[Spearhafoc]] and [[Dunstan]], all bishops.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement to Anglo-Saxon art===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon art}}
In England the pull of a Continental style operated from very early on; the [[Gregorian mission]] from Rome had brought the [[St Augustine Gospels]] and other manuscripts now lost with them, and other books were imported from the continent early on.  The 8th-century [[Bede, Ecclesiastical History (British Library, MS Cotton Tiberius C. II)|Cotton Bede]] shows mixed elements in the decoration, as does the [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]] of similar period, probably written in [[Canterbury]].&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, 96–107&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Vespasian Psalter]] it is clear which element is coming to dominate.  All these and other members of the "Tiberius" group of manuscripts were written south of the river [[Humber]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 91–94&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Codex Amiatinus]], of before 716 from Jarrow, is written in a fine [[uncial]] script, and its only illustration is conceived in an Italianate style, with no insular decoration; it has been suggested this was only because the volume was made for presentation to the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; The dating is partly known from the grant of additional land secured to raise the generations of cattle, amounting to 2,000 head in all, which were necessary to make the [[vellum]] for three complete but unillustrated Bibles, which shows the resources necessary to make the large books of the period.

Many Anglo-Saxon manuscripts written in the south, and later the north, of England show strong Insular influences until the 10th century or beyond, but the pre-dominant stylistic impulse comes from the continent of Europe; carpet-pages are not found, but many large figurative miniatures are. Panels of interlace and other Insular motifs continue to be used as one element in borders and frames ultimately classical in derivation.  Many continental manuscripts, especially in areas influenced by the Celtic missions, also show such features well into the early Romanesque period.  "Franco-Saxon" is a term for a school of late Carolingian illumination in north-eastern France that used insular-style decoration, including super-large initials, sometimes in combination with figurative images typical of contemporary French styles. The "most tenacious of all the Carolingian styles", it continued until as late as the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1998), 74(quote)–75, and see index.; Pächt, 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy of Insular art===
[[File:Meister der Franko-Sächsischen Gruppe 001.jpg|thumb|left|9th-century [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] Franco-Saxon ''Incipit'' initial combines Insular decoration with classicising [[Evangelist portrait]]s.]]

The true legacy of insular art lies not so much in the specific stylistic features discussed above, but in its fundamental departure from the classical approach to decoration, whether of books or other works of art.  The barely controllable energy of Insular decoration, spiralling across formal partitions, becomes a feature of later medieval art, especially Gothic art, in areas where specific Insular motifs are hardly used, such as architecture. The mixing of the figurative with the ornamental also remained characteristic of all later medieval illumination; indeed for the complexity and density of the mixture, Insular manuscripts are only rivalled by some 15th-century works of late Flemish illumination. It is also noticeable that these characteristics are always rather more pronounced in the north of Europe than the south; Italian art, even in the Gothic period, always retains a certain classical clarity in form.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 63–71; A major theme of Pächt, see in particular chapter II and pp. 173–177&lt;/ref&gt;

Unmistakable Insular influence can be seen in [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] manuscripts, even though these were also trying to copy the Imperial styles of Rome and Byzantium. Greatly enlarged initials, sometimes inhabited, were retained, as well as far more abstract decoration than found in classical models. These features continue in [[Ottonian]] and contemporary French illumination and metalwork, before the Romanesque period further removed classical restraints, especially in manuscripts, and the capitals of columns.&lt;ref&gt;Pächt, 72–73, and Henderson 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Muiredach s Cross.jpg|thumb|right|Muiredach's High Cross, Monasterboice]]

==Sculpture==
{{main|High cross}}
Large stone [[high cross]]es, usually erected outside monasteries or churches, first appear in the 8th century in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;[[Grove Art Online]] S4&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps at [[Carndonagh]], [[Donegal]], a monastic site with [[Iona|Ionian]] foundations,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Herity, ''Studies in the layout, buildings and art in stone of early Irish monasteries'', Pindar Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; apparently later than the earliest [[Anglo-Saxon cross]]es, which may be 7th-century.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 54–56, 113–129&lt;/ref&gt; Later insular carvings found throughout Britain and Ireland were almost entirely geometrical, as was the decoration on the earliest crosses.  By the 9th century figures are carved, and the largest crosses have very many figures in scenes on all surfaces, often from the [[Old Testament]] on the east side, and the New on the west, with a [[Crucifixion]] at the centre of the cross.  The 10th-century [[Muiredach's High Cross]] at [[Monasterboice]] is usually regarded as the peak of the Irish crosses.  In later examples the figures become fewer and larger, and their style begins to merge with the Romanesque, as at the Dysert Cross in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8th-century [[Northumbria]]n [[Ruthwell Cross]] (now in [[Scotland]]), unfortunately damaged by [[Presbyterian]] [[iconoclasm]], is the most impressive remaining [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] cross, though as with most Anglo-Saxon crosses the original cross head is missing.  Many Anglo-Saxon crosses were much smaller and more slender than the Irish ones, and therefore only had room for carved foliage, but the [[Bewcastle Cross]], [[Easby Cross]] and [[Sandbach Crosses]] are other survivals with considerable areas of figurative [[relief]]s, with larger-scale figures than any early Irish examples.  Even early Anglo-Saxon examples mix vine-scroll decoration of Continental origin with interlace panels, and in later ones the former type becomes the norm, just as in manuscripts.  There is literary evidence for considerable numbers of carved stone crosses across the whole of England, and also straight shafts, often as grave-markers, but most survivals are in the northernmost counties.  There are remains of other works of [[monumental sculpture]] in Anglo-Saxon art, even from the earlier periods, but nothing comparable from Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson deals extensively with the sculptural remains, 74–84 for the 8th century, 105–108, 141–152, 195–210 for later periods.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pictish standing stones==
{{main|Pictish stones}}
[[File:HiltonofCadboll01.JPG|thumb|upright|A replica of the [[Hilton of Cadboll Stone]], carved in the Pictish [[Easter Ross]] style 800–900 AD]]

The stone monuments erected by the [[Picts]] of [[Scotland]] north of the Clyde-Forth line between the 6th–8th centuries are particularly striking in design and construction, carved in the typical [[Easter Ross]] style related to that of insular art, though with much less classical influence. In particular the forms of animals are often closely comparable to those found in Insular manuscripts, where they typically represent the Evangelist's symbols, which may indicate a Pictish origin for these forms, or another common source.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 54–55, Henderson, 59&lt;/ref&gt; The carvings come from both pagan and early Christian periods, and the Pictish symbols, which are still poorly understood, do not seem to have been repugnant to Christians.  The purpose and meaning of the stones are only partially understood, although some think that they served as personal memorials, the symbols indicating membership of [[clan]]s, lineages, or kindreds and depict ancient ceremonies and rituals&lt;ref&gt;Laing, 53–56. See also [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17730 C. Michael Hogan, ''Eassie Stone'', The Megalithic Portal, editor: Andy Burnham, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085342/http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17730 |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Eassie Stone]] and the [[Hilton of Cadboll Stone]]. It is possible that they had subsidiary uses, such as marking tribal or lineage territories.  It has also been suggested that the [[symbol]]s could have been some kind of [[pictograph]]ic system of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

There are also a few examples of similar decoration on Pictish silver jewellery, notably the Norrie's Law Hoard, of the 7th century or perhaps earlier, much of which was melted down on discovery,&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; and the 8th-century [[St Ninian's Isle]] Hoard, with many brooches and bowls.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 117–118; Youngs, 108–112, see also [http://photos.shetland-museum.org.uk/index.php?a=subjects&amp;s=gallery&amp;key=SYToyOntpOjA7aTozMTg7aToxO3M6MTY6IlN0IE5pbmlhbidzIElzbGUiO30= Shetland museum images] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727053200/http://photos.shetland-museum.org.uk/index.php?a=subjects&amp;s=gallery&amp;key=SYToyOntpOjA7aTozMTg7aToxO3M6MTY6IlN0IE5pbmlhbidzIElzbGUiO30%3D |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving items from both are now held by [[National Museums Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nms.scran.ac.uk/s/pictish+silver|title=Search Results|first=Ian Brooks; Sven Edge; Xabier Garcia; Jamie Wheeler; Andy|last=Main|date=|website=nms.scran.ac.uk|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islamic art''' encompasses the [[visual arts]] produced from the 7th century onward by people who lived within the territory that was inhabited by or ruled by culturally [[Islamic]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Jenkins-Madina, Richard Ettinghausen and [[Oleg Grabar]], 2001, ''Islamic Art and Architecture: 650–1250'', Yale University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-300-08869-4}}, p.3; Brend, 10&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thus a very difficult art to define because it covers many lands and various peoples over some 1,400 years; it is not art specifically of a religion, or of a time, or of a place, or of a single medium like painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=J. M. Bloom |author2=S. S. Blair |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture, Vol. II |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-530991-1 |pages=vii |url=https://books.google.com/?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PR7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The huge field of [[Islamic architecture]] is the subject of a separate article, leaving fields as varied as [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[painting]], [[Islamic glass|glass]], [[Islamic pottery|pottery]], and textile arts such as [[Oriental rug|carpets]] and [[Islamic embroidery|embroidery]].

Islamic art is not at all restricted to religious art, but includes all the art of the rich and varied cultures of Islamic societies as well. It frequently includes secular elements and elements that are frowned upon, if not forbidden, by some Islamic theologians.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Penelope J.E. Denny, Walter B. Hofrichter, Frima Fox. Jacobs, Joseph. Roberts, Ann M. Simon, David L. Janson's History of Art, Prentice Hall; 2007, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Seventh Edition, {{ISBN|0-13-193455-4}} pg. 277&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the ever-present calligraphic inscriptions, specifically religious art is actually less prominent in Islamic art than in Western [[medieval art]], with the exception of Islamic architecture where [[mosque]]s and their complexes of surrounding buildings are the most common remains.  Figurative painting may cover religious scenes, but normally in essentially secular contexts such as the walls of palaces or illuminated books of poetry.  The calligraphy and decoration of manuscript [[Qur'an]]s is an important aspect, but other religious art such as glass [[mosque lamp]]s and other mosque fittings such as tiles (e.g. [[Girih tiles]]), woodwork and carpets usually have the same style and motifs as contemporary secular art, although with religious inscriptions even more prominent.

"Islamic art developed from many sources: [[Roman art|Roman]], [[Early Christian art]], and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] styles were taken over in early Islamic art and architecture; the influence of the [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian]] art of pre-Islamic Persia was of paramount significance; Central Asian styles were brought in with various nomadic incursions; and [[Chinese art|Chinese]] influences had a formative effect on Islamic painting, pottery, and textiles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=MSN Encarta: ''Islamic Art and architecture'' |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761577725/Islamic_Art_and_Architecture.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrZY56V?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761577725/Islamic_Art_and_Architecture.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the whole concept of "Islamic art" has been criticised by some modern art historians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Melikian |first=Souren |title=Qatar's Museum of Islamic Art: Despite flaws, a house of masterpieces |newspaper=International Herald Tribune|date=December 5, 2008 |quote=This is a European construct of the 19th century that gained wide acceptance following a display of Les Arts Musulmans at the old Trocadero palace in Paris during the 1889 Exposition Universelle.

There are repeating elements in Islamic art, such as the use of geometrical floral or vegetal designs in a repetition known as the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]. The arabesque in Islamic art is often used to symbolize the transcendent, indivisible and infinite nature of God.&lt;ref name="JAACMadden"&gt;Madden (1975), pp.423–430&lt;/ref&gt; Mistakes in repetitions may be intentionally introduced as a show of humility by artists who believe only God can produce perfection, although this theory is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Textile Art: Anomalies in Kilims |author=Thompson, Muhammad |author2=Begum, Nasima |url=http://www.turkotek.com/salon_00101/salon.html |work=Salon du Tapis d'Orient |publisher=TurkoTek |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The future of art in a digital age: from Hellenistic to Hebraic consciousness |last=Alexenberg |first=Melvin L. |year=2006 |publisher=Intellect Ltd |isbn=1-84150-136-0 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Only God is Perfect |url=http://www.geometricdesign.co.uk/perfect.htm |work=Islamic and Geometric Art |author=Backhouse, Tim |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, though not entirely, Islamic art has focused on the [[Islamic interlace patterns|depiction of patterns]], whether [[Islamic geometric patterns|purely geometric]] or floral, and Arabic calligraphy, [[aniconism in Islam|rather than on figures]], because it is feared by many Muslims that the depiction of the human form is [[idolatry]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-UxRoBmUnsYC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=islam+depiction+of+the+human+form+is+idolatry&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F6rsToKkBNP04QSbzOySCQ&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=islam%20depiction%20of%20the%20human%20form%20is%20idolatry&amp;f=false John L. Esposito (2010), ''The future of Islam'', Oxford University Press, page 42]&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby a sin against [[God in Islam|God]], forbidden in the [[Qur'an]].  Human portrayals can be found in all eras of Islamic art, above all in the more private form of miniatures, where their absence is rare.  Human representation for the purpose of worship is considered [[idolatry]] and is duly forbidden in some interpretations of Islamic law, known as ''[[Sharia]]'' law. There are also many [[depictions of Muhammad]], [[Mohammed|Islam's chief prophet]], in historical Islamic art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rpUuqLPPKK4C&amp;dq=wijdan&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QXySmKzsy6&amp;sig=a9V6tTTfsrTT5Ex01QGnwrL7XYY ''The Arab Contribution to Islamic Art: From the Seventh to the Fifteenth Centuries''], [[Wijdan Ali]], American Univ in Cairo Press, December 10, 1999, {{ISBN|977-424-476-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.let.uu.nl/solis/anpt/EJOS/pdf4/07Ali.pdf  ''From the Literal to the Spiritual: The Development of the Prophet Muhammad's Portrayal from 13th Century Ilkhanid Miniatures to 17th Century Ottoman Art''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041203232347/http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/anpt/ejos/pdf4/07Ali.pdf |date=2004-12-03 }}, [[Wijdan Ali]], [http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/anpt/ejos/EJOS-1.html EJOS (Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies)], volume IV, issue 7, p. 1-24, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Small decorative figures of animals and humans, especially if they are hunting the animals, are found on secular pieces in many media from many periods, but portraits were slow to develop.

== Calligraphy ==

{{main|Islamic calligraphy}}

Calligraphic design is omnipresent in Islamic art, where, as in [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]], religious exhortations, including Qur'anic verses, may be included in secular objects, especially coins, tiles and metalwork, and most painted miniatures include some script, as do many buildings. Use of Islamic calligraphy in architecture extended significantly outside of Islamic territories; one notable example is the use of [[Chinese calligraphy]] of Arabic verses from the Qur'an in the [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bondak|first1=Marwa|title=Islamic Art History: An Influential Period|url=http://blog.mozaico.com/islamic-art-history-an-influential-period/|website=Mozaico|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other inscriptions include verses of poetry, and inscriptions recording ownership or donation. Two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic ''[[kufic]]'' and ''[[Naskh (script)|naskh]]'' scripts, which can be found adorning and enhancing the visual appeal of the walls and domes of buildings, the sides of [[minbar]]s, and metalwork.&lt;ref name="JAACMadden"/&gt; Islamic calligraphy in the form of painting or sculptures are sometimes referred to as ''quranic art''.&lt;ref&gt;Islamic Archaeology in the Sudan - Page 22, Intisar Soghayroun Elzein - 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

East Persian pottery from the 9th to 11th centuries decorated only with highly stylised inscriptions, called "epigraphic ware", has been described as "probably the most refined and sensitive of all Persian pottery".&lt;ref&gt;Arts, p. 223. see nos. 278–290&lt;/ref&gt;  Large inscriptions made from tiles, sometimes with the letters raised in [[relief]], or the background cut away, are found on the interiors and exteriors of many important buildings.  Complex carved calligraphy also decorates buildings. For most of the Islamic period the majority of coins only showed lettering, which are often very elegant despite their small size and nature of production.  The [[tughra]] or monogram of an Ottoman sultan was used extensively on official documents, with very elaborate decoration for important ones.  Other single sheets of calligraphy, designed for albums, might contain short poems, Qur'anic verses, or other texts.

The main languages, all using [[Arabic script]], are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], always used for Qur'anic verses, [[Farsi|Persian]] in the [[Persianate]] world, especially for poetry, and [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet|Turkish]], with [[Urdu]] appearing in later centuries.  Calligraphers usually had a higher status than other artists.

== Painting ==

Although there has been a tradition of wall-paintings, especially in the [[Persianate]] world, the best-surviving and highest developed form of painting in the Islamic world is the [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, or later as a single page for inclusion in a ''[[muraqqa]]'' or bound album of miniatures and [[calligraphy]].  The tradition of the [[Persian miniature]] has been dominant since about the 13th century, strongly influencing the [[Ottoman miniature]] of Turkey and the [[Mughal miniature]] in India. Miniatures were especially an art of the court, and because they were not seen in public, it has been argued that constraints on the depiction of the human figure were much more relaxed, and indeed miniatures often contain great numbers of small figures, and from the 16th century portraits of single ones.  Although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands in secular contexts, notably several of the [[Umayyad Desert Castles]] (c. 660-750), and during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 749–1258).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Bloom |author2=S. Blair |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&amp;q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest commissions of illustrated books were usually classics of [[Persian poetry]] such as the epic ''[[Shahnameh]]'', although the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s both produced lavish manuscripts of more recent history with the autobiographies of the Mughal emperors, and more purely military chronicles of Turkish conquests.  Portraits of rulers developed in the 16th century, and later in Persia, then becoming very popular. Mughal portraits, normally in profile, are very finely drawn in a realist style, while the best Ottoman ones are vigorously stylized.  Album miniatures typically featured picnic scenes, portraits of individuals or (in India especially) animals, or idealized youthful beauties of either sex.

Chinese influences included the early adoption of the vertical format natural to a book, which led to the development of a birds-eye view where a very carefully depicted background of hilly landscape or palace buildings rises up to leave only a small area of sky.  The figures are arranged in different planes on the background, with recession (distance from the viewer) indicated by placing more distant figures higher up in the space, but at essentially the same size.  The colours, which are often very well preserved, are strongly contrasting, bright and clear.  The tradition reached a climax in the 16th and early 17th centuries, but continued until the early 19th century, and has been revived in the 20th.

No Islamic artistic product has become better known outside the Islamic world than the pile carpet, more commonly referred to as the ''Oriental carpet'' ([[oriental rug]]). Their versatility is utilized in everyday Islamic and Muslim life, from floor coverings to architectural enrichment, from cushions to bolsters to bags and sacks of all shapes and sizes, and to religious objects (such as a [[prayer rug]], which would provide a clean place to pray).  They have been a major export to other areas since the late Middle Ages, used to cover not only floors but tables, for long a widespread European practice that is now common only in the [[Netherlands]].  Carpet weaving is a rich and deeply embedded tradition in Islamic societies, and the practice is seen in large city factories as well as in rural communities and nomadic encampments.  In earlier periods, special establishments and workshops were in existence that functioned directly under court patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Penelope J.E. Denny, Walter B. Hofrichter, Frima Fox.

[[File:Antique oushak 418424.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Turkish carpet|Turkish]] [[Ushak carpet]]]]
Very early Islamic carpets, i.e. those before the 16th century, are extremely rare. More have survived in the West and [[oriental carpets in Renaissance painting]] from Europe are a major source of information on them, as they were valuable imports that were painted accurately.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, throughout, but 9–28, 49–50, &amp; 59 in particular&lt;/ref&gt;  The most natural and easy designs for a carpet weaver to produce consist of straight lines and edges, and the earliest Islamic carpets to survive or be shown in paintings have geometric designs, or centre on very stylized animals, made up in this way.  Since the flowing loops and curves of the arabesque are central to Islamic art, the interaction and tension between these two styles was long a major feature of carpet design.

There are a few survivals of the grand Egyptian 16th century carpets, including one almost as good as new discovered in the attic of the [[Pitti Palace]] in Florence, whose complex patterns of octagon roundels and stars, in just a few colours, shimmer before the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, 27, 61–62, as "The Medici Mamluk Carpet"&lt;/ref&gt;  Production of this style of carpet began under the [[Mamluks]] but continued after the Ottomans conquered Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, 59–66, 79–83&lt;/ref&gt;  The other sophisticated tradition was the [[Persian carpet]] which reached its peak in the 16th and early 17th century in works like the [[Ardabil Carpet]] and [[Coronation Carpet]]; during this century the Ottoman and Mughal courts also began to sponsor the making in their domains of large formal carpets, evidently with the involvement of designers used to the latest court style in the general Persian tradition.  These use a design style shared with non-figurative Islamic illumination and other media, often with a large central ''[[Gul (design)|gul]]'' motif, and always with wide and strongly demarcated borders.  The grand designs of the workshops patronized by the court spread out to smaller carpets for the merely wealthy and for export, and designs close to those of the 16th and 17th centuries are still produced in large numbers today.  The description of older carpets has tended to use the names of carpet-making centres as labels, but often derived from the design rather than any actual evidence that they originated from around that centre.  Research has clarified that designs were by no means always restricted to the centre they are traditionally associated with, and the origin of many carpets remains unclear.

As well as the major Persian, Turkish and Arab centres, carpets were also made across Central Asia, in India, and in Spain and the Balkans.  Spanish carpets, which sometimes interrupted typical Islamic patterns to include [[coats of arms]], enjoyed high prestige in Europe, being commissioned by royalty and for the [[Papal Palace, Avignon]], and the industry continued after the [[Reconquista]].&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester: Spanish carpets: 11–12, 50–52; Balkans: 77 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Armenian carpet]]-weaving is mentioned by many early sources, and may account for a much larger proportion of East Turkish and Caucasian production than traditionally thought.  The [[Berber carpet]]s of North Africa have a distinct design tradition.  Apart from the products of city workshops, in touch with trading networks that might carry the carpets to markets far away, there was also a large and widespread village and nomadic industry producing work that stayed closer to traditional local designs.  As well as pile carpets, [[kelim]]s and other types of flat-weave or [[embroidered]] textiles were produced, for use on both floors and walls.   Figurative designs, sometimes with large human figures, are very popular in Islamic countries but relatively rarely exported to the West, where abstract designs are generally what the market expects.

These columns can vary in form from being completely smooth, and having vertical or twisting fluting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the 7th and 8th century, the [[Mosque of the Prophet Medina]], was rebuilt using a style known as hypostyle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hypostyle mosques usually entail multiple columns that support a smooth and even wall.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In India, traditionally Indian stone columns of different shapes such a circles, squares and octagons, were incorporated into some mosques.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, engaged columns were introduced into decorate Islamic buildings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Ceramics ==
{{main|Islamic pottery}}
[[File:Iran orientale o asia centrale, coppa, x sec 02.JPG|thumb|left|10th-century dish from East Persia]]

Islamic art has very notable achievements in ceramics, both in [[pottery]] and [[tile]]s for walls, which in the absence of wall-paintings were taken to heights unmatched by other cultures.  Early pottery is often unglazed, but [[Tin-glazing|tin-opacified glazing]] was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of [[Stoneware|stonepaste ceramics]], originating from 9th century Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The first industrial complex for [[glass]] and [[pottery]] production was built in [[Raqqa]], [[Syria]], in the 8th century.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=J. |last1=Henderson |first2=S.

S. |last3=McPhail |year=2004 |title=Radical changes in Islamic glass technology: evidence for conservatism and experimentation with new glass recipes from early and middle Islamic Raqqa, Syria |journal=Archaeometry |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=439–68 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.2004.00167.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other centers for innovative pottery in the Islamic world included [[Fustat]] (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and [[Tabriz]] (from 1470 to 1550).&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lusterware]]s with iridescent colours may have continued pre-Islamic Roman and Byzantine techniques, but were either invented or considerably developed on pottery and glass in Persia and Syria from the 9th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 206–207&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic pottery was [[Chinese influences on Islamic pottery|often influenced]] by [[Chinese ceramics]], whose achievements were greatly admired and emulated.&lt;ref&gt;See Rawson throughout; Canby, 120–123, and see index; Jones &amp; Mitchell, 206–211&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially the case in the periods after the [[Mongol invasion]]s and those of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]].  Techniques, shapes and decorative motifs were all affected.  Until the [[Early Modern]] period Western ceramics had very little influence, but Islamic pottery was very sought after in Europe, and often copied.  An example of this is the [[albarello]], a type of [[maiolica]] earthenware jar originally designed to hold [[Apothecary|apothecaries']] ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of [[pharmacy]] jar had its roots in the Islamic Middle East. [[Hispano-Moresque]] examples were exported to Italy, stimulating the earliest Italian examples, from 15th century Florence.

[[File:Animal Decorated Ottoman Pottery P1000585.JPG|thumb|[[Iznik pottery|Iznik glazed pottery]] ca. 1575]]

The [[Hispano-Moresque]] style emerged in [[Al-Andaluz]] or Muslim Spain in the 8th century, under Egyptian influence, but most of the best production was much later, by potters presumed to have been largely Muslim but working in areas reconquered by the Christian kingdoms. It mixed Islamic and European elements in its designs, and much was exported across neighbouring European countries. It had introduced two [[ceramic]] techniques to [[Europe]]: [[ceramic glaze|glazing]] with an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] white [[tin-glazing|tin-glaze]], and [[Lusterware|painting in metallic lusters]].  Ottoman [[İznik pottery]] produced most of the best work in the 16th century, in tiles and large vessels boldly decorated with floral motifs influenced, once again, by Chinese Yuan and Ming ceramics.  These were still in earthenware; there was no porcelain made in Islamic countries until modern times, though Chinese porcelain was imported and admired.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, 175, suggests that the Persians had made some experiments towards producing it, and the earliest European porcelain, [[Medici porcelain]], was made in the late 16th century, perhaps with a Persian or [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantine]] assistant on the team.&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval Islamic world also had pottery with painted animal and human imagery. Examples are found throughout the medieval Islamic world, particularly in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Metalwork in Medieval Islamic Art |first=Eva |last=Baer |year=1983 |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]] |isbn=0-87395-602-8 |pages=58, 86, 143, 151, 176, 201, 226, 243, 292, 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tiling===
{{further|Islamic geometric patterns|Tessellation}}

[[File:HeratFridayMosque.jpg|thumb|left|Tiled exterior of the [[Friday Mosque of Herat]], [[Afghanistan]]]]
The earliest grand Islamic buildings, like the [[Dome of the Rock]], in [[Jerusalem]] had interior walls decorated with [[mosaic]]s in the Byzantine style, but without human figures.  From the 9th century onwards the distinctive Islamic tradition of glazed and brightly coloured [[tile|tiling]] for interior and exterior walls and [[dome]]s developed.  Some earlier schemes create designs using mixtures of tiles each of a single colour that are either cut to shape or are small and of a few shapes, used to create abstract geometric patterns.  Later large painted schemes use tiles painted before firing with a part of the scheme – a technique requiring confidence in the consistent results of firing.

Some elements, especially the letters of inscriptions, may be moulded in three-dimensional [[relief]], and in especially in Persia certain tiles in a design may have figurative painting of animals or single human figures.  These were often part of designs mostly made up of tiles in plain colours but with larger fully painted tiles at intervals.  The larger tiles are often shaped as eight-pointed stars, and may show animals or a human head or bust, or plant or other motifs.  The geometric patterns, such as modern North African [[zellige]] work, made of small tiles each of a single colour but different and regular shapes, are often referred to as "[[mosaic]]", which is not strictly correct.

The Mughals made much less use of tiling, preferring (and being able to afford) "parchin kari", a type of [[pietra dura]] decoration from inlaid panels of semi-precious stones, with jewels in some cases.  This can be seen at the [[Taj Mahal]], [[Agra Fort]] and other imperial commissions.  The motifs are usually floral, in a simpler and more realistic style than Persian or Turkish work, relating to plants in Mughal miniatures.

== Glass ==
{{main|Islamic glass}}
[[File:Luckofedenhall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|"The [[Luck of Edenhall]]", a 13th-century Syrian beaker, in England since the Middle Ages]]

For most of the Middle Ages Islamic glass was the most sophisticated in [[Eurasia]], exported to both Europe and China.  Islam took over much of the traditional glass-producing territory of [[Sassanian glass|Sassanian]] and [[Ancient Roman glass]], and since figurative decoration played a small part in pre-Islamic glass, the change in style is not abrupt, except that the whole area initially  formed a political whole, and, for example, Persian innovations were now almost immediately taken up in [[Egypt]].  For this reason it is often impossible to distinguish between the various centres of production, of which Egypt, Syria and Persia were the most important, except by scientific analysis of the material, which itself has difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131, 135. The Introduction (pp. 131–135) is by [[Ralph Pinder-Wilson]], who shared the catalogue entries with [[Waffiya Essy]].&lt;/ref&gt;  From various documentary references glassmaking and [[Ancient glass trade|glass trading]] seems to have been a speciality of the Jewish minority in several centres.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica, "Glass", [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07392.html Online version]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mosque lamp Met 91.1.1534.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mamluk]] [[mosque lamp]]]]

Between the 8th and early 11th centuries the emphasis in luxury glass is on effects achieved by "manipulating the surface" of the glass, initially by incising into the glass on a wheel, and later by cutting away the background to leave a design in relief.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131–133&lt;/ref&gt;  The very massive [[Hedwig glass]]es, only found in Europe, but normally considered Islamic (or possibly from Muslim craftsmen in [[Norman Sicily]]), are an example of this, though puzzlingly late in date.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131, 141&lt;/ref&gt;  These and other glass pieces probably represented cheaper versions of vessels of carved [[rock crystal]] (clear [[quartz]]), themselves influenced by earlier glass vessels,&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 141&lt;/ref&gt; and there is some evidence that at this period glass cutting and [[hardstone carving]] were regarded as the same craft.&lt;ref&gt;Endnote 111 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ONUFZfcEkBgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA88&amp;dq=Islamic+glass+Jewish&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CRdUTcrcFYHQhAepnb2vCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Islamic%20glass%20Jewish&amp;f=false ''Roman glass: reflections on cultural change''], Fleming, Stuart. see also endnote 110 for Jewish glassworkers&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 12th century the industry in Persia and [[Mesopotamia]] appears to decline, and the main production of luxury glass shifts to Egypt and Syria, and decorative effects of colour on smooth surfaced glass.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131, 133–135&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the period local centres made simpler wares such as [[Hebron glass]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

Lustre painting, by techniques similar to [[lustreware]] in pottery, dates back to the 8th century in Egypt, and became widespread in the 12th century.  Another technique was decoration with threads of glass of a different colour, worked into the main surface, and sometimes manipulated by combing and other effects.  [[Gilding|Gilded]], painted and [[Vitreous enamel|enamelled]] glass were added to the repertoire, and shapes and motifs borrowed from other media, such as pottery and metalwork.  Some of the finest work was in [[mosque lamp]]s donated by a ruler or wealthy man.  As decoration grew more elaborate, the quality of the basic glass decreased, and it "often has a brownish-yellow tinge, and is rarely free from bubbles".&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131–135, 141–146; quote, 134&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aleppo]] seems to have ceased to be a major centre after the [[Mongol invasion]] of 1260, and [[Timur]] appears to have ended the Syrian industry about 1400 by carrying off the skilled workers to [[Samarkand]].  By about 1500 the [[Venice|Venetians]] were receiving large orders for mosque lamps.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metalwork ==
[[File:Bassin Syrie 1.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of the "Baptistère de Saint-Louis," c. 1300, a [[Mamluk]] basin of engraved brass with gold, silver and [[niello]] inlay]]

Medieval Islamic metalwork offers a complete contrast to its European equivalent, which is dominated by modelled figures and brightly coloured decoration in [[vitreous enamel|enamel]], some pieces entirely in precious metals.  In contrast surviving Islamic metalwork consists of practical objects mostly in [[brass]], bronze, and steel, with simple, but often monumental, shapes, and surfaces highly decorated with dense decoration in a variety of techniques, but colour mostly restricted to inlays of gold, silver, copper or black [[niello]].  The most abundant survivals from medieval periods are fine brass objects, handsome enough to preserve, but not valuable enough to be melted down.  The abundant local sources of [[zinc]] compared to [[tin]] explains the rarity of [[bronze]].  Household items, such as ewers or water pitchers, were made of one or more pieces of sheet brass soldered together and subsequently worked and inlaid.&lt;ref name=Baer1983&gt;{{cite book |last=Baer |first=Eva |title=Metalwork in Medieval Islamic Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s__yi4pD-VEC |year=1983 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-87395-602-4 |pages=whole book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the [[Hadith]]s, as was the wearing of gold rings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=24&amp;translator=2 Hadithic texts against gold and silver vessels]&lt;/ref&gt;  One thing Islamic metalworkers shared with European ones was high social status compared to other artists and craftsmen, and many larger pieces are signed.

Islamic work includes some three-dimensional animal figures as fountainheads or [[aquamanile]]s, but only one significant enamelled object is known, using Byzantine [[cloisonne]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 201, and earlier pages for animal shapes.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Pisa Griffin]] is the largest surviving bronze animal, probably from 11th century Al-Andaluz.  More common objects given elaborate decoration include massive low candlesticks and lamp-stands, lantern lights, bowls, dishes, basins, buckets (these probably for the bath),&lt;ref&gt;But see Arts, 170, where the standard view is disputed&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ewer]]s, as well as caskets, pen-cases and plaques. Ewers and basins were brought for hand-washing before and after each meal, so are often lavishly treated display pieces.  A typical 13th century ewer from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] is decorated with foliage, animals and the [[Signs of the Zodiac]] in silver and copper, and carries a blessing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/91.1.530 "Base of a ewer with Zodiac medallions &amp;#91;Iran&amp;#93; (91.1.530)"].

(New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1997), 16. The inscription reads: ''“Bi-l-yumn wa al-baraka…”'' meaning “With bliss and divine grace…”&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialized objects include knives, arms and armour (always of huge interest to the elite) and scientific instruments such as [[astrolabe]]s, as well as [[jewellery]].  Decoration is typically densely packed and very often includes arabesques and calligraphy, sometimes naming an owner and giving a date.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 157–160, and exhibits 161–204&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other applied arts ==
[[File:Dagger horse head Louvre OA7891.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] dagger with hilt in [[jade]], gold, [[rubies]] and [[emerald]]s.  Blade of [[damascening|damascened]] steel inlaid with gold.]]
High levels of achievement were reached in other materials, including [[hardstone carving]]s and jewellery, ivory carving, textiles and leatherwork. During the Middle Ages, Islamic work in these fields was highly valued in other parts of the world and often traded outside the Islamic zone.  Apart from miniature painting and calligraphy, other arts of the book are decorative illumination, the only type found in Qur'an manuscripts, and Islamic book covers, which are often highly decorative in luxury manuscripts, using either the geometric motifs found in illumination, or sometimes figurative images probably drawn for the craftsmen by miniature painters.  Materials include coloured, tooled and stamped leather and [[lacquer]] over paint.&lt;ref&gt;See the relevant sections in "Arts"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precious stones===

Egyptian carving of [[rock crystal]] into vessels appears in the late 10th century, and virtually disappears after about 1040.  There are a number of these vessels in the West, which apparently came on the market after the [[Cairo]] palace of the [[Fatimid]] [[Caliph]] was looted by his mercenaries in 1062, and were snapped up by European buyers, mostly ending up in church treasuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://simerg.com/literary-readings/literary-reading-fatimid-rock-crystal-ewers-most-valuable-objects-in-islamic-art/ Fatimid Rock Crystal Ewers, Most Valuable Objects in Islamic Art]&lt;/ref&gt; From later periods, especially the hugely wealthy Ottoman and Mughal courts, there are a considerable number of lavish objects carved in semi-precious stones, with little surface decoration, but inset with jewels.  Such objects may have been made in earlier periods, but few have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

===House and furniture===
[[File:WLA vanda Ottoman marquetry and tile-top table 2.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman [[marquetry]] and tile-top table, about 1560]]
Older wood carving is typically relief or pierced work on flat objects for architectural use, such as screens, doors, roofs, beams and friezes.  An important exception are the complex [[muqarnas]] and [[mocárabe]] designs giving roofs and other architectural elements a [[stalactite]]-like appearance. These are often in wood, sometimes painted on the wood but often plastered over before painting; the examples at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada, Spain]] are among the best known.  Traditional Islamic furniture, except for chests, tended to be covered with cushions, with cupboards rather than cabinets for storage, but there are some pieces, including a low round (strictly twelve-sided) table of about 1560 from the Ottoman court, with [[marquetry]] inlays in light wood, and a single huge ceramic tile or plaque on the tabletop.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:WLA vanda Ottoman marquetry and tile-top table 2.jpg|Table]] in the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The fine inlays typical of Ottoman court furniture may have developed from styles and techniques used in weapons and musical instruments, for which the finest craftsmanship available was used.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers and Ward, 156&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also intricately decorated caskets and chests from various periods.  A spectacular and famous (and far from flat) roof was one of the Islamic components of the 12th century Norman [[Cappella Palatina]] in [[Palermo]], which picked from the finest elements of Catholic, Byzantine and Islamic art.  Other famous wooden roofs are in the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]].

===Ivory===

[[File:Panel hunters Louvre OA 6265-1.jpg|left|upright=&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;1.3|thumb|Ivory with traces of paint, 11th–12th century, Egypt]]
[[Ivory carving#Islamic ivory|Ivory carving]] centred on the [[Mediterranean]], spreading from Egypt, where a thriving [[Copt]]ic industry had been inherited;  Persian ivory is rare.  The normal style was a deep relief with an even surface; some pieces were painted.  Spain specialized in caskets and round boxes, which were probably used to keep jewels and perfumes.  They were produced mainly in the approximate period 930–1050, and widely exported. Many pieces are signed and dated, and on court pieces the name of the owner is often inscribed; they were typically gifts from a ruler. As well as a court workshop, [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] had commercial workshops producing goods of slightly lower quality.  In the 12th and 13th century workshops in [[Norman Sicily]] produced caskets, apparently then migrating to Granada and elsewhere after persecution.  Egyptian work tended to be in flat panels and friezes, for insertion into woodwork and probably furniture – most are now detached from their settings.  Many were calligraphic, and others continued Byzantine traditions of hunting scenes, with backgrounds of arabesques and foliage in both cases.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 147–150, and exhibits following&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:IlkhanateSilkCircular.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ilkhanid]] piece in silk, cotton and gold, Iran or Iraq, early 14th century]]

===Silk===

Despite [[Hadithic]] sayings against the wearing of silk, the Byzantine and Sassanian traditions of grand figured silk woven cloth continued under Islam.  Some designs are calligraphic, especially when made for palls to cover a tomb, but more are surprisingly conservative versions of the earlier traditions, with many large figures of animals, especially majestic symbols of power like the lion and eagle.  These are often enclosed in roundels, as found in the pre-Islamic traditions.  The majority of early silks have been recovered from tombs, and in Europe [[reliquaries]], where the relics were often wrapped in silk.  European clergy and nobility were keen buyers of Islamic silk from an early date and, for example, the body of an early bishop of [[Toul]] in France was wrapped in a silk from the [[Bukhara]] area in modern [[Uzbekistan]], probably when the body was reburied in 820.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 65–68; 74, no. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Shroud of St Josse]] is a famous [[samite]] cloth from East Persia, which originally had a carpet-like design with two pairs of confronted elephants, surrounded by borders including rows of [[camel]]s and an inscription in [[Kufic]] script, from which the date appears to be before 961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice_popup.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500781 Louvre, Suaire de St-Josse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623185919/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice_popup.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500781 |date=2011-06-23 }}. Exhibited as no. 4 in Arts, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other silks were used for clothes, hangings, altarcloths, and church vestments, which have nearly all been lost, except for some vestments.

[[File:Batik Indonesia.jpg|170px|left|thumb|upright|[[Javanese culture|Javanese]] court [[batik]]]]

Ottoman silks were less exported, and the many surviving royal [[kaftan]]s have simpler geometric patterns, many featuring stylized "tiger-stripes" below three balls or circles.  Other silks have foliage designs comparable to those on Iznik pottery or carpets, with bands forming ogival compartments a popular motif. Some designs begin to show Italian influence.  By the 16th century Persian silk was using smaller patterns, many of which showed relaxed garden scenes of beautiful boys and girls from the same world as those in contemporary album miniatures, and sometimes identifiable scenes from Persian poetry. A 16th-century circular ceiling for a tent, 97&amp;nbsp;cm across, shows a continuous and crowded hunting scene; it was apparently looted by the army of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in his invasion of Persia in 1543–45, before being taken by a Polish general at the [[Siege of Vienna]] in 1683. Mughal silks incorporate many Indian elements, and often feature relatively realistic "portraits" of plants, as found in other media.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 68, 71, 82–86, 106–108, 110–111, 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesian batik===
{{main|Batik}}

The development and refinement of [[Indonesia]]n ''[[batik]]'' cloth was closely linked to Islam.  The Islamic prohibition on certain images encouraged ''batik'' design to become more abstract and intricate.  Realistic depictions of animals and humans are rare on traditional ''batik''.  However, mythical serpents, humans with exaggerated features and the [[Garuda]] of pre-Islamic mythology are common motifs.

Although its existence pre-dates Islam, ''batik'' reached its zenith in royal Muslim courts such as [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] and [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Yogyakarta]], whose [[sultan]]s encouraged and patronised ''batik'' production.  Today, batik is undergoing a revival, and cloths are used for additional purposes such as wrapping the Quran.

== History ==

===Beginnings===

====Pre-dynastic====
[[File:Mschatta-Fassade (Pergamonmuseum).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mshatta facade|Palace facade from Mshatta]] in Jordan, now in the [[Pergamon Museum, Berlin]], c.&amp;nbsp;?740]]  
The period of a rapid expansion of the Islamic era forms a reasonably accurate beginning for the label of Islamic art. Early geographical boundaries of the Islamic culture were in present-day [[Syria]]. It is quite difficult to distinguish the earliest Islamic objects from their predecessors in Persian or [[Sassanid]] and [[Byzantine art]], and the conversion of the mass of the population, including artists, took a significant period, sometimes centuries, after the initial [[Muslim conquest]]. There was, notably, a significant production of unglazed ceramics, witnessed by a famous small bowl preserved in the [[Louvre]], whose inscription assures its attribution to the Islamic period. Plant motifs were the most important in these early productions.

Influences from the Sassanian artistic tradition include the image of the king as a warrior and the lion as a symbol of nobility and virility. [[Bedouin]] tribal traditions mixed with the more sophisticated styles of the conquered territories.  For an initial period coins had human figures in the Byzantine and Sassanian style, perhaps to reassure users of their continued value, before the Islamic style with lettering only took over.

====Umayyad====
[[File:Umayyad Mosque-Mosaics west.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaics from the ''riwaq'' (portico) of the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]]]]
Religious and civic architecture were developed under the [[Umayyad]] dynasty (661–750), when new concepts and new plans were put into practice.

The [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]] is one of the most important buildings in all of Islamic architecture, marked by a strong Byzantine influence ([[mosaic]] against a gold background, and a central plan that recalls that of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]), but already bearing purely Islamic elements, such as the great epigraphic [[frieze]]. The desert palaces in [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]] (for example, [[Mshatta facade|Mshatta]], [[Qasr Amra]], and Khirbat al-Mafjar) served the caliphs as living quarters, reception halls, and baths, and were decorated, including some wall-paintings, to promote an image of royal luxury.

Work in ceramics was still somewhat primitive (unglazed) during this period. Some metal objects have survived from this time, but it remains rather difficult to distinguish these objects from those of the pre-Islamic period.

'Abd al-Malik introduced standard coinage that featured Arabic inscriptions, instead of images of the monarch. The quick development of a localized coinage around the time of the Dome of the Rock's construction demonstrates the reorientation of Umayyad acculturation. This period saw the genesis of a particularly Islamic art.

In this period, Umayyad artists and artisans did not invent a new vocabulary, but began to prefer those received from Mediterranean and Iranian [[late antiquity]], which they adapted to their own artistic conceptions. For example, the mosaics in the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]] are based on [[Byzantine]] models, but replace the figurative elements with images of trees and cities. The desert palaces also bear witness to these influences. By combining the various traditions that they had inherited, and by readapting motifs and architectural elements, artists created little by little a typically Muslim art, particularly discernible in the aesthetic of the arabesque, which appears both on monuments and in illuminated [[Qur'ān]]s.

====Abbasid====
[[File:Cup Susa Louvre MAO568.jpg|thumb|[[Lusterware]] bowl from [[Susa]], 9th century, today in the Louvre]]
The [[Abbasid dynasty]] (750 [[AD]] – 1258&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, World of Art&lt;/ref&gt;) witnessed the movement of the capital from [[Damascus]] to [[Baghdad]], and then from Baghdad to [[Samarra]]. The shift to Baghdad influenced politics, culture, and art. [[Art history|Art historian]] Robert Hillenbrand (1999) likens the movement to the foundation of an "Islamic [[Rome]]", because the meeting of Eastern influences from Iranian, Eurasian steppe, Chinese, and Indian sources created a new paradigm for Islamic art. Classical forms inherited from Byzantine Europe and Greco-Roman sources were discarded in favor of those drawn from the new Islamic hub. Even the design of the city of Baghdad placed it in the "navel of the world", as 9th-century historian al-Ya'qubi wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient city of Baghdad cannot be excavated well, as it lies beneath the modern city. However, [[Abbasid Samarra]], which was largely abandoned, has been well studied, and is known for its surviving examples of [[stucco]] reliefs, in which the prehistory of the [[arabesque]] can be traced.  Motifs known from the stucco at Samarra permit the dating of structures built elsewhere, and are furthermore found on portable objects, particular in wood, from Egypt through to Iran.

[[Samarra]] witnessed the "coming of age" of Islamic art. Polychrome painted [[stucco]] allowed for experimentation in new styles of moulding and carving. The Abbasid period also coincided with two major innovations in the ceramic arts: the invention of [[faience]], and of metallic [[lusterware]]. [[Hadith]]ic prohibition of the use of golden or silver vessels led to the development of metallic [[lusterware]] in pottery, which was made by mixing sulphur and metallic oxides to ochre and vinegar, painted onto an already glazed vessel and then fired a second time. It was expensive, and difficult to manage the second round through the kiln, but the wish to exceed fine [[Chinese porcelain]] led to the development of this technique.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tiraz Textile Fragment with Inscriptions with Name of Caliph al-Muti', 946-974.jpg|thumb|upright=&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;1.3|Tiraz Textile Fragment, 946–974 [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Though the common perception of Abbasid artistic production focuses largely on pottery, the greatest development of the Abbasid period was in textiles. Government-run workshops known as ''[[tiraz]]'' produced silks bearing the name of the monarch, allowing for aristocrats to demonstrate their loyalty to the ruler. Other silks were pictorial. The utility of silk-ware in wall decor, entrance adornment, and room separation was not as important as its cash value along the "[[silk route]]".

Calligraphy began to be used in surface decoration on pottery during this period. Illuminated [[Qur'an]]s gained attention, letter-forms now more complex and stylized to the point of slowing down the recognition of the words themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period (9th–15th centuries)===
Beginning in the 9th century, Abbasid sovereignty was contested in the provinces furthest removed from the Iraqi center. The creation of a [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] dynasty, that of the north African [[Fatimid]]s, followed by the [[Caliph of Córdoba|Umayyads in Spain]], gave force to this opposition, as well as small dynasties and autonomous governors in Iran.

====Spain and the Maghreb====
[[File:Morocco Fez Embroidery Horse Cover.JPG|thumb|Moroccan [[Islamic embroidery|Embroidery]] [[fly mask]]]]
[[File:Pyxid Al Mughira OA 4068.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pyxis of al-Mughira]], Madinat al-Zahra, Spain, 968]]

The first Islamic dynasty to establish itself in Spain (or [[al-Andalus]]) was that of the Spanish Umayyads. As their name indicates, they were descended from the great Umayyads of Syria. After their fall, the Spanish Umayyads were replaced by various autonomous kingdoms, the [[taifa]]s (1031–91), but the artistic production from this period does not differ significantly from that of the Umayyads. At the end of the 11th century, two Berber tribes, the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] and the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]], captured the head of the Maghreb and Spain, successively, bringing Maghrebi influences into art. A series of military victories by Christian monarchs had reduced Islamic Spain by the end of the 14th century to the city of [[Granada]], ruled by the Nasirid dynasty, who managed to maintain their hold until 1492.

Al-Andalus was a great cultural center of the Middle Ages. Besides the great universities, which taught philosophies and sciences yet unknown in Christendom (such as those of [[Averroes]]), the territory was an equally vital center for art.

Many techniques were employed in the manufacture of objects. Ivory was used extensively for the manufacture of boxes and caskets. The [[pyxis of al-Mughira]] is a masterwork of the genre. In metalwork, large sculptures in the round, normally rather scarce in the Islamic world, served as elaborate receptacles for water or as fountain spouts. A great number of textiles, most notably silks, were exported: many are found in the church treasuries of Christendom, where they served as covering for saints’ [[reliquaries]]. From the periods of [[Maghreb]]i rule one may also note a taste for painted and sculpted woodwork.

The art of north Africa is not as well studied. The Almoravid and Almohad dynasties are characterized by a tendency toward austerity, for example in mosques with bare walls. Nevertheless, luxury arts continued to be produced in great quantity. The Marinid and Hafsid dynasties developed an important, but poorly understood, architecture, and a significant amount of painted and sculpted woodwork.

====Arab Mashriq====
The Fatimid dynasty, which reigned in Egypt from 909 and 1171 introduced crafts and knowledge from politically troubled Baghdad to Cairo.

By the year 1070, the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]]s emerged as the dominant political force in the Muslim world after they liberated Baghdad and defeated the Byzantines at [[Manzikert]]. During the rule of [[Malik Shah I|Malik Shah]] the Seljuks excelled in architecture at the same time in Syria, the [[atabeg]]s (governors of Seljuk princes) assumed power. Quite independent, they capitalized on conflicts with the Frankish [[Crusades|crusaders]]. In 1171, [[Saladin]] seized Fatimid Egypt, and installed the transitory [[Ayyubid dynasty]] on the throne. This period is notable for innovations in metallurgy and the widespread manufacture of the Damascus steel swords and daggers and the production ceramics, glass and metalwork of a high quality were produced without interruption, and enameled glass became another important craft.

In 1250, the [[Mamluk]]s seized control of Egypt from the Ayyubids, and by 1261 had managed to assert themselves in Syria as well their most famous ruler was [[Baibars]]. The Mamluks were not, strictly speaking, a dynasty, as they did not maintain a patrilineal mode of succession; in fact, Mamluks were freed Turkish and Caucasian slaves, who (in theory) passed the power to others of like station. This mode of government persevered for three centuries, until 1517, and gave rise to abundant architectural projects (many thousands of buildings were constructed during this period), while patronage of luxury arts favored primarily enameled glass and metalwork, and is remembered as the golden age of medieval Egypt.  The "Baptistère de Saint-Louis" in the [[Louvre]] is an example of the very high quality of metalwork at this period.

====Iran and Central Asia====
[[File:SamarkandBibiKhanym.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bibi-Khanym Mosque]], [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]], built by [[Timur]] in 1399]]
In Iran and the north of India, the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]], [[Samanid]]s, [[Ghaznavids]], and [[Ghurids]] struggled for power in the 10th century, and art was a vital element of this competition. Great cities were built, such as [[Neyshabur|Nishapur]] and [[Ghazni]], and the construction of the Great Mosque of [[Isfahan]] (which would continue, in fits and starts, over several centuries) was initiated. Funerary architecture was also cultivated, while potters developed quite individual styles: kaleidoscopic ornament on a yellow ground; or marbled decorations created by allowing colored glazes to run; or painting with multiple layers of slip under the glaze.

The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]], nomads of Turkic origin from present-day Mongolia, appeared on the stage of Islamic history toward the end of the 10th century. They seized Baghdad in 1048, before dying out in 1194 in Iran, although the production of "Seljuq" works continued through the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century under the auspices of smaller, independent sovereigns and patrons. During their time, the center of culture, politics and art production shifted from [[Damascus]] and [[Baghdad]] to [[Merv]], [[Nishapur]], [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]], and [[Isfahan]], all in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.89&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ceramic bowl decorated with slip beneath a transparent glaze and designed by anthropic figure with bull head Golestan, Gorgan 9th century CE, Early Islamic period.jpg|thumb|Ceramic bowl decorated with slip beneath a transparent glaze, Gorgan, 9th century CE, Early Islamic period, National Museum of Iran]]
Popular patronage expanded because of a growing economy and new urban wealth.   Inscriptions in architecture tended to focus more on the patrons of the piece.  For example, sultans, viziers or lower ranking officials would receive often mention in inscriptions on mosques.  Meanwhile, growth in mass market production and sale of art made it more commonplace and accessible to merchants and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.91&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of increased production, many relics have survived from the Seljuk era and can be easily dated.  In contrast, the dating of earlier works is more ambiguous.  It is, therefore, easy to mistake Seljuk art as new developments rather than inheritance from classical Iranian and Turkic sources.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovations in ceramics from this period include the production of minai ware and the manufacture of vessels, not out of clay, but out of a [[silicon]] paste ("[[fritware]]"), while metalworkers began to encrust bronze with precious metals.  Across the Seljuk era, from Iran to Iraq, a unification of book painting can be seen.  These paintings have animalistic figures that convey strong symbolic meaning of fidelity, treachery, and courage.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 13th century, the [[Mongols]] under the leadership of [[Genghis Khan]] swept through the Islamic world. After his death, his empire was divided among his sons, forming many dynasties: the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] in China, the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanids]] in Iran and the [[Golden Horde]] in northern Iran and southern Russia.

=====Ilkhanids=====
A rich civilization developed under these "little khans", who were originally subservient to the Yuan emperor, but rapidly became independent. Architectural activity intensified as the Mongols became sedentary, and retained traces of their nomadic origins, such as the north-south orientation of the buildings. At the same time a process of "iranisation" took place, and construction according to previously established types, such as the "Iranian plan" mosques, was resumed. The [[Persian miniature|art of the Persian book]] was also born under this dynasty, and was encouraged by aristocratic patronage of large manuscripts such as the ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]'' by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]]. New techniques in ceramics appeared, such as the lajvardina (a variation on luster-ware), and Chinese influence is perceptible in all arts.

=====The Golden Horde and the Timurids=====
The early arts of the nomads of the Golden Horde are poorly understood. Research is only beginning, and evidence for town planning and architecture has been discovered. There was also a significant production of works in gold, which often show a strong Chinese influence. Much of this work is preserved today in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]].

The beginning of the third great period of medieval Iranian art, that of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], was marked by the invasion of a third group of nomads, under the direction of [[Timur]]. During the 15th century this dynasty gave rise to a golden age in Persian manuscript painting, including renowned painters such as [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād]], but also a multitude of workshops and patrons.

====Syria, Iraq, Anatolia====
[[File:Erzurum Cifte Minareli Sunrise.JPG|thumb|[[Çifte Minareli Medrese]] in Erzurum. Before 1265]]
The Seljuq Turks pushed beyond Iran into Anatolia, winning a victory over the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the [[Battle of Manzikert]] (1071), and setting up a sultanate independent of the Iranian branch of the dynasty. Their power seems largely to have waned following the Mongol invasions in 1243, but coins were struck under their name until 1304. Architecture and objects synthesized various styles, both Iranian and Syrian, sometimes rendering precise attributions difficult. The art of woodworking was cultivated, and at least one illustrated manuscript dates to this period.

[[Caravanserai]]s dotted the major trade routes across the region, placed at intervals of a day's travel. The construction of these caravanserai [[inns]] improved in scale, fortification, and replicability. Also, they began to contain central mosques.

The [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] were nomads who settled in the area of [[Lake Van]]. They were responsible for a number of mosques, such as the [[The Blue Mosque of Tabriz|Blue Mosque]] in [[Tabriz]], and they had a decisive influence after the fall of the Anatolian Seljuqs. Starting in the 13th century, Anatolia was dominated by small Turkmen dynasties, which progressively chipped away at Byzantine territory. Little by little a major dynasty emerged, that of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottomans]], who, after 1450, are referred to as the "first Ottomans". Turkmen artworks can be seen as the forerunners of Ottoman art, in particular the "Milet" ceramics and the first blue-and-white Anatolian works.

Islamic book painting witnessed its first golden age in the thirteenth century, mostly from Syria and Iraq. Influence from Byzantine visual vocabulary (blue and gold coloring, angelic and victorious motifs, symbology of drapery) combined with Mongoloid facial types in 12th-century [[book frontispiece]]s.

Earlier coinage necessarily featured Arabic [[epigraphy|epigraph]]s, but as Ayyubid society became more cosmopolitan and multi-ethnic, coinage began to feature [[astrology|astrological]], figural (featuring a variety of Greek, Seleucid, Byzantine, Sasanian, and contemporary Turkish rulers' busts), and animal images.

Hillenbrand suggests that the medieval Islamic texts called ''[[Maqama]]t'', copied and illustrated by [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti]] were some of the earliest "[[coffee table book]]s". They were among the first texts to hold up a mirror to daily life in Islamic art, portraying humorous stories and showing little to no inheritance of pictorial tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p.128-131&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian subcontinent====

The Indian subcontinent, some northern parts of which conquered by the Ghaznavids and Ghurids in the 9th century, did not become autonomous until 1206, when the Muizzi, or slave-kings, seized power, marking the birth of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Later other competing sultanates were founded in [[Bengal]], [[Kashmir region|Kashmir]], [[Gujarat]], [[Jaunpur Sultanate|Jaunpur]], [[Malwa (Madhya Pradesh)|Malwa]], and in the north [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] (the [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmanids]]). They separated themselves little by little from Persian traditions, giving birth to an original approach to architecture and urbanism, marked in particular by interaction with [[Hindu]] art. Study of the production of objects has hardly begun, but a lively art of manuscript illumination is known. The period of the sultanates ended with the arrival of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], who progressively seized their territories.

===The Three Empires===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}

====Ottomans====
[[File:Iznik ware 1500 1510.jpg|thumb|left|16th century [[İznik pottery]]]]
The [[Ottoman Empire]], whose origins lie in the 14th century, continued in existence until shortly after [[World War I]]. This impressive longevity, combined with an immense territory (stretching from Anatolia to Tunisia), led naturally to a vital and distinctive art, including plentiful architecture, mass production of ceramics for both tiles and vessels, most notably [[İznik pottery|Iznik ware]], important metalwork and jewellery, Turkish paper marbling [[Ebru]], [[Turkish carpet]]s as well as tapestries and exceptional [[Ottoman miniature]]s and decorative [[Ottoman illumination]].

Masterpieces of Ottoman manuscript illustration include the two "[[Surname-I Hümayun|books of festivals]]" (Surname-I Hümayun), one dating from the end of the 16th century, and the other from the era of Sultan [[Murad III]]. These books contain numerous illustrations and exhibit a strong [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] influence; thus they may have been inspired by books captured in the course of the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 16th century.

The Ottomans are also known for their development of a bright red pigment, "Iznik red", in ceramics, which reached their height in the 16th century, both in tile-work and pottery, using floral motifs that were considerably transformed from their Chinese and Persian models.  From the 18th century, Ottoman art came under considerable European influence, the Turks adopting versions of [[Rococo]] which had a lasting and not very beneficial effect, leading to over-fussy decoration.

====Mughals====

The [[Mughal Empire]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] lasted from 1526 until (technically) 1858, although from the late 17th century power flowed away from the emperors to local rulers, and later European powers, above all the [[British Raj]], who were the main power in India by the late 18th century. The period is most notable for luxury arts of the court, and Mughal styles heavily influenced local Hindu and later [[Sikh]] rulers as well. The [[Mughal miniature]] began by importing Persian artists, especially a group brought back by [[Humayun]] when in exile in [[Safavid]] Persia, but soon local artists, many Hindu, were trained in the style.  Realistic portraiture, and images of animals and plants, was developed in Mughal art beyond what the Persians had so far achieved, and the size of miniatures increased, sometimes onto canvas.  The Mughal court had access to European prints and other art, and these had increasing influence, shown in the gradual introduction of aspects of Western [[graphical perspective]], and a wider range of poses in the human figure.  Some Western images were directly copied or borrowed from.  As the courts of local [[Nawab]]s developed, distinct provincial styles with stronger influence from traditional [[Indian painting]] developed in both Muslim and Hindu princely courts.

The arts of jewelry and [[hardstone carving]] of gemstones, such as [[jasper]], [[jade]], adorned with rubies, diamonds and emeralds are mentioned by the Mughal chronicler [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l Fazl]], and a range of examples survive; the series of hard stone daggers in the form of horses’ heads is particularly impressive.

The Mughals were also fine metallurgists they introduced [[Damascus steel]] and refined the locally produced [[Wootz steel]], the Mughals also introduced the "bidri" technique of metalwork in which silver motifs are pressed against a black background. Famous Mughal metallurgists like [[Ali Kashmiri]] and [[Muhammed Salih Thatawi]] created the [[wikt:seamless|seamless]] [[celestial globes]].

====Safavids and Qajars====
[[File:Sheykh lotfollah mosque.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to [[Sheykh Lotfollah mosque]], [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]], [[Isfahan]]]]
The Iranian [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]], a dynasty stretching from 1501 to 1786, is distinguished from the Mughal and Ottoman Empires, and earlier Persian rulers, in part through the Shi'a faith of its shahs, which they succeeded in making the majority denomination in Persia.  Ceramic arts are marked by the strong influence of Chinese porcelain, often executed in [[blue and white porcelain|blue and white]]. Architecture flourished, attaining a high point with the building program of [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]] in [[Isfahan]], which included numerous gardens, palaces (such as [[Ālī Qāpū|Ali Qapu]]), an immense bazaar, and a [[Shah Mosque|large imperial mosque]].

[[File:Fes Medersa Bou Inania Mosaique2.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Bou Inania Madrasa]], [[Fes]], [[Morocco]], [[zellige]] mosaic tiles forming elaborate [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric]] [[tessellations]]]]

The art of manuscript illumination also achieved new heights, in particular in the [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] [[Shahnameh]], an immense copy of [[Ferdowsi]]’s poem containing more than 250 paintings. In the 17th century a new type of painting develops, based around the album ([[muraqqa]]). The albums were the creations of conoisseurs who bound together single sheets containing paintings, drawings, or calligraphy by various artists, sometimes excised from earlier books, and other times created as independent works. The paintings of [[Reza Abbasi]] figure largely in this new art of the book, depicting one or two larger figures, typically idealized beauties in a garden setting, often using the [[grisaille]] techniques previously used for border paintings for the background.

After the fall of the Safavids, the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]], a [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribe established from centuries on the banks of the [[Caspian Sea]], assumed power. Qajar art displays an increasing European influence, as in the large oil paintings portraying the Qajar shahs. Steelwork also assumed a new importance. Like the Ottomans, the Qajar dynasty survived until 1925, a few years after the First World War.

== Modern period ==
From the 15th century, the number of smaller Islamic courts began to fall, as the Ottoman Empire, and later the Safavids and European powers, swallowed them up; this had an effect on Islamic art, which was usually strongly led by the patronage of the court.  From at least the 18th century onwards, elite Islamic art was increasingly influenced by European styles, and in the applied arts either largely adopted Western styles, or ceased to develop, retaining whatever style was prevalent at some point in the late 18th or early 19th centuries.  Many industries with very long histories, such as [[Persian pottery|pottery in Iran]], largely closed, while others, like metalwork in [[brass]], became generally frozen in style, with much of their production going to tourists or exported as oriental exotica.

The carpet industry has remained large, but mostly uses designs that originated before 1700, and competes with machine-made imitations both locally and around the world.  Arts and crafts with a broader social base, like the [[zellige]] mosaic tiles of the [[Maghreb]], have often survived better.  Islamic countries have developed modern and contemporary art, with very vigorous art worlds in some countries, but the degree to which these should be grouped in a special category as "Islamic art" is questionable, although many artists deal with Islam-related themes, and use traditional elements such as calligraphy.  Especially in the oil-rich parts of the Islamic world much modern architecture and interior decoration makes use of motifs and elements drawn from the heritage of Islamic art.

'''Islamic influences on Western art''' refers to the influence of [[Islamic art]], the artistic production in the [[Islamic world]] from the 8th to the 19th century, on [[Christian art]]. During this period, the frontier between [[Christendom]] and the Islamic world varied a lot resulting in some cases in exchanges of populations and of corresponding art practices and techniques. Furthermore, the two civilizations had regular relationships through diplomacy and trade that facilitated cultural exchanges.  Islamic art covers a wide variety of media including calligraphy, illustrated manuscripts, textiles, ceramics, metalwork and glass, and refers to the art of Muslim countries in the Near East, Islamic Spain, and Northern Africa, though by no means always Muslim artists or craftsmen.  [[Islamic glass|Glass production]], for example, remained a [[Jewish]] speciality throughout the period, and Christian art, as in [[Coptic art|Coptic Egypt]] continued, especially during the earlier centuries, keeping some contacts with Europe.

Islamic decorative arts were highly valued imports to Europe throughout the Middle Ages; largely because of unsuspected accidents of survival the majority of surviving examples are those that were in the possession of the church.  In the early period textiles were especially important, used for church vestments, shrouds, hangings and clothing for the elite.  Islamic pottery of everyday quality was still preferred to European wares.  Because decoration was mostly ornamental, or small hunting scenes and the like, and inscriptions were not understood, Islamic objects did not offend Christian sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|pp=3–8, and throughout}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early centuries of Islam the most important points of contact between the Latin West and the Islamic world from an artistic point of view were Southern Italy and Sicily and the Iberian peninsula, which both held significant Muslim populations.  Later the [[Italian maritime republic]]s were important in trading artworks. In the  [[Crusades]] Islamic art seems to have had relatively little influence even on the [[Crusader art]] of the [[Crusader kingdom]]s, though it may have stimulated the desire for Islamic imports among Crusaders returning to Europe.

Numerous techniques from [[Islamic art]] formed the basis of art in the [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture]] of [[Norman Sicily]], much of which used Muslim artists and craftsmen working in the style of their own tradition.  Techniques included inlays in [[mosaic]]s or [[metal]]s, [[ivory carving]] or [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], sculpture of hard stones, and bronze [[Foundry|foundries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aubé|2006|pp=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Iberia the [[Mozarabic art and architecture]] of the Christian population living under Muslim rule remained very Christian in most ways, but showed Islamic influences in other respects; much what was described as this is now called [[Repoblación art and architecture]]. After the [[Reconquista]]  [[Mudéjar]] styles produced by Muslim or [[Morisco]] artists now under Christian rule showed clear Islamic influence in many ways.

==Middle Ages==
[[File:hispanomoresque.JPG|thumb|right|350px|[[Hispano-Moresque]] dish, approx 32cm diameter, with Christian monogram "[[Christogram|IHS]]", decorated in cobalt blue and gold lustre, [[Valencia]], c.1430-1500.]]
Islamic art was widely imported and admired by European elites during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, 324; Mack, Chapter 1, and passim throughout; [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sumay/hd_sumay.htm The Art of the Umayyad Period in Spain (711–1031), Metropolitan Museum of Art timeline] Retrieved April 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  There was an early formative stage from 600-900 and the development of regional styles from 900 onwards.  Early Islamic art used mosaic artists and sculptors trained in the Byzantine and Coptic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|Fleming|1982|pp=256–262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of wall-paintings, Islamic art used painted [[tile]]s, from as early as 862-3 (at the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque]] of [[Kairouan]] in modern [[Tunisia]]), which also spread to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|Fleming|1982|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[John Ruskin]], the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in [[Venice]] contains "three elements in exactly equal proportions — the Roman, the Lombard, and Arab. It is the central building of the world.&amp;nbsp;... the history of Gothic architecture is the history of the refinement and spiritualisation of Northern work under its influence".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'', [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/sov/1.html chapter 1, paras 25 and 29]; discussed pp.&amp;nbsp;49–56 here [https://books.google.com/books?id=QzI3Pf0TSn4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=Ruskin+Orientalism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TF5qlcqm2M&amp;sig=PwSUx7Ghq5kozj-Y7AIWLOxPlk8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3AqjTfWYOpG4hAfP2tDWCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ruskin%20Orientalism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic rulers controlled at various points parts of Southern Italy and most of modern Spain and Portugal, as well as the [[Balkans]], all of which retained large Christian populations. The Christian [[Crusade]]rs equally ruled Islamic populations. [[Crusader art]] is mainly a hybrid of Catholic and Byzantine styles, with little Islamic influence, but the [[Mozarabic art]] of Christians in [[Al Andaluz]] seems to show considerable influence from Islamic art, though the results are little like contemporary Islamic works. Islamic influence can also be traced in the mainstream of Western medieval art, for example in the Romanesque portal at [[Moissac]] in southern France, where it shows in both decorative elements, like the scalloped edges to the doorway, the circular decorations on the [[lintel]] above, and also in having ''Christ in Majesty'' surrounded by musicians, which was to become a common feature of Western heavenly scenes, and probably derives from images of Islamic kings on their [[Divan (furniture)|diwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|pp=206–209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calligraphy]], ornament and the [[decorative arts]] generally were more important than in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Dalu &amp; Michell, George, (eds); ''The Arts of Islam'', [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], 9, 1976, {{ISBN|0-7287-0081-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hispano-Moresque]] pottery wares of Spain were first produced in Al-Andaluz, but Muslim potters then seem to have emigrated to the area of Christian [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], where they produced work that was exported to Christian elites across Europe;&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, chapters 6 &amp; 7&lt;/ref&gt; other types of Islamic luxury goods, notably silk textiles and carpets, came from the generally wealthier&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]], ''An Unfinished History of the World'', 224-226, 2nd edn. 1981, Pan Books, {{ISBN|0-330-26458-3}}; [[Fernand Braudel|Braudel, Fernand]], ''Civilization &amp; Capitalism, 15-18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life'', William Collins &amp; Sons, London 1981, p. 440: "If medieval Islam towered over the Old Continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific for centuries on end, it was because no state (Byzantium apart) could compete with its gold and silver money&amp;nbsp;..."; and Vol 3: ''The Perspective of the World'', 1984, {{ISBN|0-00-216133-8}}, p. 106: "For them [the Italian maritime republics], success meant making contact with the rich regions of the Mediterranean - and obtaining gold currencies, the dinars of Egypt or Syria,&amp;nbsp;...

===Decorative arts===
[[File:Late Medieval Trade Routes.jpg|thumb|Map showing the main trade routes of late medieval Europe.]]
A wide variety of portable objects from various [[decorative arts]] were imported from the Islamic world into Europe during the Middle Ages, mostly through Italy, and above all Venice.&lt;ref&gt;The subject of Mack's book; see Chapter 1 especially.&lt;/ref&gt;  In many areas European-made goods could not match the quality of Islamic or Byzantine work until near the end of the Middle Ages.  Luxury textiles were widely used for clothing and hangings and also, fortunately for art history, also often as shrouds for the burials of important figures, which is how most surviving examples were preserved.  In this area [[Byzantine silk]] was influenced by [[Sassanian]] textiles, and Islamic silk by both, so that is hard to say which culture's textiles had the greatest influence on the [[Cloth of St Gereon]], a large [[tapestry]] which is the earliest and most important European imitation of Eastern work.  European, especially Italian, cloth gradually caught up with the quality of Eastern imports, and adopted many elements of their designs.

Byzantine pottery was not produced in high-quality types, as the Byzantine elite used silver instead.  Islam has many [[hadith]]ic injunctions against eating off precious metal, and so developed many varieties of fine pottery, often influenced by the [[Chinese porcelain]] wares which had the highest status among the Islamic elites themselves — the Islamic only produced porcelain in the modern period.  Much Islamic pottery was imported into Europe, dishes ("bacini") even in Islamic [[Al-Andaluz]] in the 13th century, in [[Granada]] and [[Málaga]], where much of the production was already exported to Christian countries.  Many of the potters migrated to the area of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], long reconquered by the Christians, and production here outstripped that of Al-Andaluz.  Styles of decoration gradually became more influenced by Europe, and by the 15th century the Italians were also producing lustrewares, sometimes using Islamic shapes like the [[albarello]].&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, Chapters 6 and 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Metalwork forms like the zoomorphic jugs called [[aquamanile]] and the bronze [[Mortar and pestle|mortar]] were also introduced from the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|Michell|1976|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mudéjar art in Spain===
{{Main article|Mudéjar}}
Mudéjar art is a style influenced by Islamic art that developed from the 12th century until the 16th century in the Iberia's Christian kingdoms. It is the consequence of the ''{{Lang|es|convivencia}}'' between the Muslim, Christian and Jewish populations in medieval Spain.  The elaborate decoration typical of Mudéjar style fed into the development of the later [[Plateresque]] style in Spanish architecture, combining with late Gothic and Early Renaissance elements.

===Pseudo-Kufic===
[[File:Limoges enamel ciborium pseudo Kufic circa 1200.jpg|thumb|Master Alpais' [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]], circa 1200 with rim engraved with Arabic script, [[Limoges]], [[France]], 1215-30. Louvre Museum MRR 98.]]
{{Main article|Pseudo-Kufic}}
The [[Arabic]] [[Kufic]] script was often imitated in the West during the Middle-Ages and the Renaissance, to produce what is known as [[pseudo-Kufic]]: ''"Imitations of Arabic in European art are often described as pseudo-Kufic, borrowing the term for an Arabic script that emphasizes straight and angular strokes, and is most commonly used in Islamic architectural decoration"''.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous cases of pseudo-Kufic are known in European religious art from around the 10th to the 15th century. Pseudo-Kufic would be used as writing or as decorative elements in textiles, religious [[halos]] or frames. Many are visible in the paintings of [[Giotto]].&lt;ref name="Mack, p.51"/&gt;

Examples are known of the incorporation of Kufic script such as a 13th French Master Alpais' [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]] at the [[Louvre Museum]].&lt;ref group="N"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226036&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500778&amp;bmLocale=en |work=Louvre museum website |author=Muriel Barbier |title=Master Alpais' ciborium – Master G.

===Architecture===
====Arab-Norman culture in Sicily====
{{Main article|Arab-Norman culture}}
Christian buildings such as the [[Cappella Palatina]] in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], incorporated Islamic elements, probably usually created by local Muslim craftsmen working in their own traditions. The ceiling at the Cappella, with its wooden vault arches and gilded figurines,  has close parallels with Islamic buildings in [[Fes|Fez]] and [[Fustat]], and reflect the ''[[Muqarnas]]'' ([[stalactite]]) technique of emphasizing three-dimensional elements&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kleinhenz|Barker|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=spKxJeHJgTAC&amp;pg=PA835 835]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[diaphragm arch]], [[Late Antique]] in origin, was widely used in Islamic architecture, and may have spread from Spain to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bony|1985|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k7ytJ-gXonMC&amp;pg=PA306#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 306]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Saracen style" ====
[[File:The Liwan or Sanctuary of the Mosque of Ibn-Tuloon (1878) - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|left|The Liwan or Sanctuary of the Mosque of Ibn-Tuloon (1878)&lt;ref group="N"&gt;Ebers, Georg. "Egypt: Descriptive, Historical, and Picturesque." Volume 1. Cassell &amp; Company, Limited: New York, 1878. p 213&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Scholars of the 18&amp;ndash;19th century, who generally preferred [[Classical art]], disliked what they saw as the "disorder" of [[Gothic art]] and perceived similarities between Gothic and Islamic  architecture.  They often overstated the case that Gothic art fully originated in the Islamic art of the [[Mosque]], to the point of calling it "[[Saracens|Saracenical]]". [[William John Hamilton]] commented on the [[Seljuks]] monuments in [[Konya]]: "The more I saw of this peculiar style, the more I became convinced that the Gothic was derived from it, with a certain mixture of Byzantine (...) the origin of this Gotho-Saracenic style may be traced to the manners and habits of the Saracens"&lt;ref group="N"&gt;William John Hamilton (1842) ''Researches in Asia Minor, Pontus and Armenia'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=s8tJAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA206 p.206]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schiffer|1999|p=141 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fhcYwZIGd94C&amp;pg=PA141]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th-century English historian [[Thomas Warton]]  summarized:
{{quote|"The marks which constitute the character of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Saracen]]ical architecture, are, its numerous and prominent [[buttress]]es, its lofty [[spire]]s and [[pinnacle]]s, its large and ramified windows, its ornamental niches or [[Canopy (building)|canopies]], its sculptured saints, the delicate lace-work of its fretted roofs, and the profusion of ornaments lavished indiscriminately over the whole building: but its peculiar distinguishing characteristics are, the small cluttered pillars and pointed arches, formed by the segments of two interfering circles"|[[Thomas Warton]] ''Essays on Gothic architecture''&lt;ref group="N"&gt;Thomas Warton (1802), ''Essays on Gothic architecture'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=FCoBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA119 p.14]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Pointed arch ====
{{Further information|Gothic architecture|Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Norman architecture}}

[[File:StDenis Chorumgang.JPG|thumb|upright|Ambulatory of [[Basilique Saint-Denis]], origin of Gothic architecture in France. Facade and choir 1135-44, nave from 1231 onwards]]

The [[pointed arch]] originated in the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]] empires, where it mostly appears in early [[Church architecture|Christian church buildings]], although engineering works such as the Byzantine [[Karamagara Bridge]] also showed it fully developed at an early stage.&lt;ref name="Warren 61-63"/&gt; The priority of the Byzantines in its use is also evidenced by slightly pointed examples in [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe|Sant'Apollinare in Classe]], [[Ravenna]], and the [[Hagia Irene]], [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="Warren 61-63"/&gt; The pointed arch was subsequently adopted and widely used by Muslim architects, becoming the characteristic arch of Islamic architecture.&lt;ref name="Warren 61-63"&gt;{{Citation |last = Warren |first = John | year =  1991 |title = Creswell's Use of the Theory of Dating by the Acuteness of the Pointed Arches in Early Muslim Architecture |periodical = Muqarnas |volume = 8 |pages = 59–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bony, it has spread from Islamic lands, possibly through [[Sicily]], then under Islamic rule, and from there to [[Amalfi]] in [[Italy]], before the end of the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Bony 17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bony|1985|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k7ytJ-gXonMC&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardner p.342"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kleiner|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&amp;pg=PT342 342]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pointed arch reduced architectural thrust by about 20% and therefore had practical advantages over the semi-circular [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] arch for the building of large structures.&lt;ref name="Bony 17"/&gt;

Oleg Grabar refers to unspecified speculation that the [[Rose window]] may have Islamic origins as unlikely. "While not excluded on purely chronological grounds since its earliest known instance is in the [[Ummayad]] palace at [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]], this conclusion seems highly suspect to me... that both cultures were frequently operating on practically the same kind of 'track' is further suggested by the visual and aesthetic similarities between the ornamental values of flamboyant vaults and Islamic architectural decoration. It is not very likely that a direct impact of one on the other can be demonstrated, and we are certainly dealing with parallel growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grabar|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_CS4n8kca9cC&amp;pg=PA387 387]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Islamic architecture, the Gothic style was influenced by Roman architecture.&lt;ref name="Bony, 12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bony|1985|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k7ytJ-gXonMC&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 12]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Templar churches====
[[File:Seal of Templars.jpg|thumb|Seal of the Knights Templar featuring a domed building, whether from a dome from Al-Aqsa, the Dome of the Rock or the aedicula of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]]]
In 1119, the [[Knights Templar]] received as headquarters part of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in Jerusalem, considered by the crusaders the [[Temple of Solomon]], from which the order took its common name.
The typical [[round church]]es built by the Knights across Western Europe, such as the London [[Temple Church]], are probably inspired in the shape of Al-Aqsa or its neighbor [[Dome of the Rock]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[God and Enchantment of Place]]: Reclaiming Human Experience'', [[David Brown (theologian)|David Brown]], Oxford University Press, 2004, page 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic elements in Renaissance art==
[[File:Gentile da Fabriano 015.jpg|thumb|[[Pseudo-Kufic]] script in the [[Virgin Mary]]'s [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], detail of ''Adoration of the Magi'' (1423) by [[Gentile da Fabriano]]. The script is further divided by [[Rosette (design)|rosette]]s like those on [[Mamluk]] dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Pseudo-Kufic===
Pseudo-Kufic is a decorative motif which resembles Kufic script and occurs in many [[Italian Renaissance painting]]s.  The exact reason for the incorporation of pseudo-Kufic in early Renaissance works is unclear. It seems that Westerners mistakenly associated 13th&amp;ndash;14th-century Middle-Eastern scripts as being identical with the scripts current during [[Jesus]]'s time, and thus found natural to represent early Christians in association with them:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|pp=52, 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''"In Renaissance art, pseudo-Kufic script was used to decorate the costumes of [[Old Testament]] heroes like David"''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tsiIvJ16AU0C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Pseudo-Kufic&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=en Freider. p.84]&lt;/ref&gt; Mack states another hypothesis: {{quote|Perhaps they marked the imagery of a universal faith, an artistic intention consistent with the Church's contemporary international program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Oriental carpets===

{{Main article|Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting}}
[[File:Verrocchio Madonna with Saint John the Baptist and Donatus 1475 1483.jpg|thumb|[[Verrocchio]]'s ''Madonna with Saint John the Baptist and Donatus'' 1475-1483 with small-pattern Holbein Islamic carpet at her feet.]]
[[Carpet]]s of [[Middle-Eastern]] origin, either from the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Levant]] or the [[Mamluk]] state of [[Egypt]] or [[Northern Africa]], were used as important decorative features in [[paintings]] from the 13th century onwards, and especially in religious painting, starting from the Medieval period and continuing into the Renaissance period.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.73-93"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|pp=73–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such carpets were often integrated into Christian imagery as symbols of luxury and status of Middle-Eastern origin, and together with [[Pseudo-Kufic]] script offer an interesting example of the integration of Eastern elements into European painting.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.73-93"/&gt;

[[Transylvanian rugs|Anatolian rugs were used in Transylvania]] as decoration in Evangelical churches.&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Ionescu| first1=Stefano| title=Antique Ottoman Rugs in Transylvania| date=2005| publisher=Verduci Editore| location=Rome| edition=1st| url=http://www.transylvanianrugs.com/pdf/01.pdf| accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic costumes===
[[Image:Giovanni di Niccolò Mansueti 001.jpg|thumb|15th-century [[Mamluks]] depicted in ''The Arrest of St. Mark from the Synagogue'', [[Giovanni di Niccolò Mansueti]], 1499.]] 
Islamic individuals and costumes often provided the contextual backdrop to describe an evangelical scene. This was particularly visible in a set of Venetian paintings in which contemporary [[Syrian]], [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]], [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] and especially [[Mamluk]] personages are employed anachronistically in paintings describing [[Biblical]] situations.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.161"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example in point is the 15th century ''[[:File:Giovanni di Niccolò Mansueti 001.jpg|The Arrest of St. Mark from the Synagogue]]'' by [[Giovanni di Niccolò Mansueti]] which accurately describes contemporary (15th century) Alexandrian Mamluks arresting [[Saint Mark]] in an historic scene of the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.161"/&gt; Another case is [[Gentile Bellini]]'s ''[[:File:Gentile Bellini 001.jpg|Saint Mark Preaching in Alexandria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|pp=164–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ornament===
A Western style of [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] based on the Islamic [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] developed, beginning in late 15th century [[Venice]]; it has been called either [[moresque]] or [[Arabesque (European art)|western arabesque]] (a term with a complicated history).  It has been used in a great variety of the [[decorative arts]] but has been especially long-lived in book design and [[bookbinding]], where small motifs in this style have continued to be used by conservative book designers up to the present day.  It is seen in gold tooling on covers, borders for illustrations, and printer's ornaments for decorating empty spaces on the page. In this field the technique of gold tooling had also arrived in the 15th century from the Islamic world, and indeed much of the leather itself was imported from there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harthan|1961|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other Renaissance ornament styles it was disseminated by [[ornament print]]s which were bought as patterns by craftsmen in a variety of trades.  Peter Furhring, a leading specialist in the history of ornament, says that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The ornament known as moresque in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (but now more commonly called arabesque) is characterized by bifurcated scrolls composed of branches forming interlaced foliage patterns.  These basic motifs gave rise to numerous variants, for example, where the branches, generally of a linear character, were turned into straps or bands. ... It is characteristic of the moresque, which is essentially a surface ornament, that it is impossible to locate the pattern's beginning or end. ... Originating in the Middle East, they were introduced to continental Europe via Italy and Spain ... Italian examples of this ornament, which was often used for bookbindings and embroidery, are known from as early as the late fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fuhring|1994|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elaborate book bindings with Islamic designs can be seen in religious paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|pp=125–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[:File:San Zeno Altarpiece.jpg|Saint John the Baptist and Zeno]]'', [[John the Baptist|Saint John]] and [[Zeno of Verona|Zeno]] hold exquisite books with covers displaying Mamluk-style center-pieces, of a type also used in contemporary Italian book-binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mack|2001|pp=127–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lady at the Tea Table''''' is a late 19th century painting by American artist [[Mary Cassatt]]. The work, done in oil on canvas, is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/10391?searchField=All&amp;amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;amp;what=Paintings&amp;amp;high=on&amp;amp;ao=on&amp;amp;od=on&amp;amp;ft=*&amp;amp;offset=80&amp;amp;rpp=20&amp;amp;pos=86|title=metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Description ==
=== History ===
The painting depicts Mary Dickinson Riddle, Cassatt’s mother’s first cousin, seated at a table set with a [[tea service]]. The tea set was a gift to Cassatt's family from Riddle's daughter. The tea service itself is gilded blue-and-white porcelain from [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (modern day Guangzhou) in [[Qing dynasty]] [[China]]; In the 19th century, Canton was renowned for its exports to the [[Western world]], as the port city was one of the centers of the [[Old China Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penobscotmarinemuseum.org/pbho-1/maine-and-orient/old-china-trade-1842|title=The Old China Trade: Before 1842  {{!}} Penobscot Bay History Online|website=penobscotmarinemuseum.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crossman, Carl L. (1991). ''The decorative arts of the China trade''. Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK: Antique Collectors' Club. {{ISBN|1851490965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lady'' itself was painted by Cassatt as a gift for the Riddle family. However, Riddle's daughter disliked the painting, thinking it portrayed her mother's nose as being too big, and thus the painting was donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Cassatt in 1923.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldsbestpaintings.net/artistsandpaintings/painting/198/|title=Great Works of Western Art -

=== Painting ===
The painting exemplifies much of Cassatt's unique impressionist style; much emphasis is placed on the subject's stark outline, and Mrs. Riddle's jewelry pairs with the gold gilt on the tea service. Similarly, the faint blue hues used in the background draw the eye to the deeper blues of Riddle's eyes and the porcelain. The relative simplicity of the painting's design is also comparable to oriental art, which Cassat was influenced by.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Lena Alekseevna Hades''' ({{lang-ru|Лена Алексеевна Хейдиз}}; born October 2, 1959) is a Russian artist, writer and [[art theory|art theorist]] of Jewish origin.

==Biography==
A Russian artist, writer and art theoretician. Lena Hades was born in [[Siberia]], while her father was on a business trip, on the day of the total [[solar eclipse]] on October 2, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nietzsche.ru/around/meeting/hades/|script-title=ru:Встреча с Леной Хейдиз|trans-title=Artists: Lena Hades|publisher=Site Nietzsche.ru|language=ru|accessdate=October 15, 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103142509/http://www.nietzsche.ru/around/meeting/hades/|archivedate=November 3, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father worked as communication engineer, her mother was a physician. At the age of 35 the future artist's father got ill with [[multiple sclerosis]] and died at the age of 51. Lena, his daughter, took care of the father herself till the day of his death, January 17, 1985.  Memories about her father and his tragic life had a great impact on the artist. It is the father's disease that triggered her interest in the concept of death, and also in the philosophical problems of existence – the main topics of her creative works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nietzsche.ru/around/meeting/hades/|script-title=ru:Встреча с Леной Хейдиз|trans-title=Artists: Lena Hades|publisher=Site Nietzsche.ru|language=ru|accessdate=October 15, 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103142509/http://www.nietzsche.ru/around/meeting/hades/|archivedate=November 3, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lena Hades graduated from Moscow State Pedagogical University in 1982 (Faculty of [[Physics]] and [[Mathematics]]), and she also completed higher foreign language courses (Spanish, Italian, Polish, French, German, English), and worked as a translator for many years. Being 35, she decided to become an artist, and in 1995 she left for Germany.  In [[Cologne]] she created her first works and sold her first painting, gaining the first fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nietzsche.ru/around/meeting/hades/|script-title=ru:Встреча с Леной Хейдиз|trans-title=Artists: Lena Hades|publisher=Site Nietzsche.ru|language=ru|accessdate=October 15, 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103142509/http://www.nietzsche.ru/around/meeting/hades/|archivedate=November 3, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995–1997 she created more than 30 paintings, devoted to "[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]" by [[Nietzsche]]. For her, these works are visual metaphors, not mere illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.ru/n20605 |script-title=ru:Так (не) говорил Заратустра – параллельная программа 1 Московской биеннале |trans-title=Artists: Lena Hades |publisher=Museums News |language=ru |accessdate=2005-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213040039/http://www.museum.ru/N20605 |archivedate=February 13, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series of "[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]" paintings is unique, as there is no more powerful, picturesque, clear and accurate representation of aphoristic expressions in the world than this one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.ru/n20605 |script-title=ru:Так (не) говорил Заратустра – параллельная программа 1 Московской биеннале|trans-title=Artists: Lena Hades|publisher=Museums News|language=ru |accessdate=2005-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the oil painting and graphic cycle "[[Also Sprach Zarathustra (painting)|Also Sprach Zarathustra]]" was exhibited in the Institute of Philosophy of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. In 2004 the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] published a bilingual edition of "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" by Nietzsche – in Russian and German. The cover and the jacket of the book are decorated with two paintings by Lena Hades. The book also contains twenty other works from this cycle. Her paintings are in collections of the [[Moscow Museum of Modern Art]], the Igor Markin Museum of contemporary art, the [[Pushkin Museum]], the State [[Tretyakov Gallery]] etc. The works of the above series were also exhibited at the First [[Moscow Biennale]] of contemporary art in 2005, in the Institute of Philosophy of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 1997 and in the State Kashyrka Gallery in 1998. She is living and working in Moscow.

==Famous works==
Lena Hades is known worldwide not only for her painting and graphic cycle "[[Also Sprach Zarathustra (painting)|Also Sprach Zarathustra]]", but also for two other paintings of hers, which [[Russian nationalists]] deem [[Russophobia]]n. Therefore, in March 2008 the group of Russian nationalists (over 300 people) took legal action against the artist, since in their opinion these two paintings provoke "racial and nationalistic hostility and hatred". The first work is called "Welcome to Russia" (1999). It was purchased by Igor Markin Museum of Contemporary Art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art4.ru/ru/artists/detail.php?ID=7284 |script-title=ru:Художники: Хейдиз Лена |trans-title=Artists: Lena Hades |publisher=ART4.RU Contemporary Art Museum |language=ru |accessdate=2013-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213195512/http://www.art4.ru/ru/artists/detail.php?ID=7284 |archivedate=December 13, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the name of the other painting is "The Chimera of the mysterious Russian soul" (1996). It was exhibited only once, at the Second [[Moscow Biennale]] of contemporary art in 2005. Russian nationalists were offended by the fact that the artist depicted the Russian soul as a horrible monster with a bottle of vodka in the hand, an accordion, a book by Dostoyevsky and with a satellite. The nationalists decided that this was a parody to the state emblem of Russia and the offence of the very country and its people. Painting called "Welcome to Russia" shows a real unadorned Russian character, as both too aggressive and very god-fearing. The nationalists decided that this truth was offensive. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russia-ic.com/news/show/6321/ |title=Artist Sued for Russophobia |work=Russia-InfoCentre |date=May 8, 2008 |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political pressing==
In June 2010 Lena Hades was summoned to testify on the above two paintings to Basmannaya prosecutor's office, Moscow, she was threatened to be tried and heavily fined, since she could have been accused of hatred and hostility propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=4C17C25184737 |script-title=ru:В картинах Лены Хейдиз обнаружили экстремизм |trans-title=In pictures Lena Hades found extremism |language=ru |work=Kasparov.ru |date=June 15, 2010 |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art activism==

==Autobiographic series==
The above works are an absolute contrast to the autobiographic series of paintings "A Girl with bows". The work called "A girl with bows, the woman that mows. The Dance" is a personal confession made by the artist herself. It is in this painting that she bravely and courageously shows the poly-semantic world of the kingdom of death. Aides is the god of the dead. This depiction of the kingdom of death is not related to the Christian world, It is closer to [[Nietzsche]]'s image of the Hell "even god possesses his hell – which is his love to people". Painting "A girl with bows, the woman that mows.The Dance" is the climax of the whole series. This image of the dance around pagan fires enables the artist to communicate as a peer with supernatural forces, undergo initiation by fire. It is the fire of death that helped to transform and strengthen her spirit.  There is no more fear, the horror of death has been overcome. This provides an opportunity and power to possess the sacred theme of death.  Graphic cycle of scalp works proves that Lena Hades is an artist and a person, who can live on the edge of life and death and bear this knowledge to people in her artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Hades art catalogue, 1999, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Len Siffleet''' (14 January 1916&amp;nbsp;– 24 October 1943) was an [[Australian commandos|Australian commando]] of World War&amp;nbsp;II. Born in [[Gunnedah, New South Wales|Gunnedah]], New South Wales, he joined the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] in 1941, and by 1943 had reached the rank of [[sergeant]]. Posted to [[M Special Unit]] of the [[Services Reconnaissance Department]], Siffleet was on a mission in [[Papua New Guinea]] when he and two [[Ambonese]] companions were captured by partisan tribesmen and handed over to the Japanese. All three men were interrogated, tortured and later [[Decapitation|beheaded]]. A photograph of Siffleet's impending execution became an enduring image of the war, and his identity was often confused with that of other servicemen who suffered a similar fate, in particular Flight Lieutenant [[Bill Newton]], [[Victoria Cross|VC]].

==Early life==
[[File:P02547.002Siffleet1941.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Siffleet and fiancée Clarice Lane, 1941]]
Leonard George Siffleet was born on 14 January 1916 in [[Gunnedah, New South Wales|Gunnedah]], New South Wales. The son of an itinerant worker of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] ancestry,&lt;ref name="AWM"&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/people/1078334.asp Sergeant Leonard George (Len) Siffleet] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 25 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richmond"&gt;Richmond, "'Locust', 'Whiting' and New Britain"&lt;/ref&gt; his siblings included a sister and two brothers. Siffleet made his way to [[Sydney]] in the late 1930s, seeking to join the [[New South Wales Police Force|police force]], but was prevented from doing so because of his eyesight. He was nevertheless called up for the [[Australian Army Reserves|militia]] in August 1940, and attached to a [[searchlight]] unit at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]].&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;

Discharged from the militia after three months, Siffleet returned to his family to help look after his young brothers following their mother's death. He was working as a shop assistant when he enlisted in the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) in September 1941.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dexter"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Dexter | url = http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/22/chapters/09.pdf | title = The New Guinea Offensives | pages = 259–60 | format = [[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allotted to a signals company based at [[Ingleburn, New South Wales|Ingleburn]], New South Wales, he was reported [[Desertion|absent without leave]] on two occasions; he was by this time engaged to Clarice Lane.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;

==New Guinea campaign==
After training in radio communications at [[RMIT University|Melbourne Technical College]], Siffleet volunteered for special operations in September 1942 and was posted to the [[Services Reconnaissance Department]] (SRD) of the [[Allied Intelligence Bureau]] in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cas.awm.gov.au/photograph/P02547.004 AWM Collection Record: P02547.004] at Australian War Memorial. Retrieved on 25 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[Z Special Unit]] in October and was transferred to [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]] in [[Far North Queensland]] for further operational training. Assigned to the SRD's Dutch section as a radio operator, Siffleet was promoted [[sergeant]] in May 1943. He moved across to [[M Special Unit]] the same month to take part in a mission to set up a [[Coastwatchers|coastwatching]] station in the hills behind [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dexter"/&gt; Described by Commander [[Eric Feldt]], director of the Coastwatchers, as "the best type of N.C.O. of the A.I.F., young and competent",&lt;ref&gt;Feldt, ''The Coastwatchers'', p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Siffleet joined a party led by Sergeant H. N. Staverman of the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], which included two [[Ambonese]] privates, H. Pattiwal and M. Reharing. Code-named [[Operation Whiting]], their task was to work in concert with another group ([[Operation Locust]]), led by Lieutenant Jack Fryer.&lt;ref name="Richmond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dexter"/&gt;

Staverman's reconnaissance group commenced its mission in north-east New Guinea in July, trekking across mountainous terrain through August and September. At some point Staverman and Pattiwal separated from the others to undertake further exploration of the countryside, and were ambushed by a group of natives. Both were captured and reported as killed, but Pattiwal later escaped and rejoined Siffleet and Reharing. Siffleet signalled Fryer to warn him of the hostile natives and of Japanese patrols, indicating that he was preparing to burn his party's codes and bury its radio. No more was heard from them after early October.&lt;ref name="Richmond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dexter"/&gt; Clarice Lane (incorrectly addressed as "Clemice" Lane) had in the meantime received two letters from the Allied Intelligence Bureau in July and September, stating that Siffleet was "safe and well".&lt;ref name="Lane, Clarice"&gt;[http://cas.awm.gov.au/privaterecord/PR00899 AWM Collection Record: PR00899] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512020403/http://cas.awm.gov.au/privaterecord/PR00899 |date=12 May 2009 }} at Australian War Memorial. Retrieved on 25 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:LeonardGSiffleet.jpg|thumb|upright|Sergeant Siffleet's execution at Aitape, 1943]]
After Pattiwal rejoined Siffleet and Reharing, they attempted to make their way to the Dutch border. They were ambushed by a hundred native villagers near [[Aitape]] and, after a brief melée during which Siffleet shot and wounded one of their attackers, the group was captured and handed over to the Japanese. Interrogated and tortured, the team was confined for approximately two weeks before being taken down to Aitape Beach on the afternoon of 24 October 1943. Bound and blindfolded, surrounded by Japanese and native onlookers, they were forced to the ground and executed by [[Decapitation|beheading]], on the orders of Vice-Admiral [[Michiaki Kamada]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richmond"/&gt; The officer who executed Siffleet, Yasuno Chikao, detailed a private to photograph him in the act.&lt;ref&gt;Adam-Smith, ''Prisoners of War'', p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; Chikao has been variously reported as having died before the end of the war, and as having been captured and sentenced to be hanged, with his sentence subsequently commuted to 10 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cas.awm.gov.au/photograph/101099 AWM Collection Record: 101099] at Australian War Memorial.

Retrieved on 25 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The photograph of Siffleet's execution was discovered on the body of a dead Japanese major near [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] by American troops in April 1944. It is believed to be the only surviving depiction of a western [[prisoner of war]] being executed by a Japanese soldier.&lt;ref name="Lakin_155"&gt;Lakin, ''Contact'', p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The photo was published in Australian newspapers and in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine but was thought to depict Flight Lieutenant [[William Ellis Newton|Bill Newton]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]], who had been captured in [[Salamaua]], Papua New Guinea, and beheaded on 29 March 1943.&lt;ref name="Richmond"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKernan, ''The Strength of a Nation'', pp. 267–270&lt;/ref&gt; It later went on display at the [[Australian War Memorial]]. Elsewhere, despite positive identification in 1945 of Siffleet as the soldier pictured, the image continues on occasion to be misidentified as Newton.&lt;ref name="Richmond"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/people/658.asp Flight Lieutenant William Ellis Newton, VC] at Australian War Memorial. Retrieved on 27 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Siffleet is commemorated on the [[Lae War Cemetery|Lae Memorial]] in [[Lae]], Papua New Guinea, together with all other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] war dead from actions in the region who have no known grave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2801485 Casualty details: Siffleet, Leonard George] and [http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/2084700  Cemetery details: Lae Memorial] at [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]. Retrieved on 1 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial park commemorating Siffleet was also dedicated at Aitape in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shrine for war heroes|url=http://www.thenational.com.pg/?q=node/87822|accessdate=14 May 2015|work=The National|date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[Royal Doulton]] [[Bunnykins]] figurines.  Doulton &amp; Co. (Royal Doulton) introduced the Bunnykins figurines in 1939 with six original Bunnykins figurines designed by [[Charles Noke]] based on illustrations by [[Mary Barbara Bailey|Sister Mary Barbara Bailey]].  Shortly thereafter, and prior to World War II, Doulton &amp; Co. discontinued their manufacture.  After Royal Doulton purchased the [[Beswick Pottery]] factory in 1969, Royal Doulton reintroduced the Bunnykins figurines.&lt;ref name=Irvine1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irvine|first1=Louise|title=Royal Doulton Bunnykins Figures|date=1991|publisher=UK International Ceramics|location=England|isbn=0951777254}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the closure of Royal Doulton factory in England in 2005, Bunnykins figurines are produced in Asia.  The Bunnykins figurines are in ascending order and include the name of the figurine, designer/modeler, date introduced, and the date discontinued.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="376618">'''Fairy tales''' are stories that range from those originating in folklore to more modern stories defined as literary fairy tales. Despite subtle differences in the categorizing of [[fairy tale]]s, [[folklore]], [[fable]]s, [[Mythology|myths]], and [[legend]]s, a modern definition of the fairy tale, as provided by Jens Tismar's monologue in German, is a story that differs "from an oral folk tale", written by "a single identifiable author", which can be characterised as "simple and anonymous", and exists in a mutable and difficult to define genre with a close relationship to [[Oral tradition|folktale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, xv&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hollywood iO West Theatre.jpg|thumb|The [[I.O. West]] theater, the site of the [[Los Angeles Improv Comedy Festival]].]]
'''Improvisational-theater festivals''', also known as '''improv-comedy festivals''' or '''improv festivals''', are venues where multiple [[List of improvisational theatre companies|improvisational-theater groups]] perform.

They are usually not limited by improvisational style, though they may limit entrants to professional-only or collegiate-only.

Most [[improvisational theater|improvisational-theater]] festivals are hosted by a single troupe, but others are hosted by conglomerations of troupes or a company set up solely for that given festival.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="66923">'''Music recording certifications''' are typically awarded by the global [[music industry]] based on the total units sold, streamed, or shipped to retailers. These awards and their requirements are defined by the various [[Music recording sales certification|certifying]] bodies representing the music industry in various countries and territories worldwide. The standard certification awards given consist of Gold, Platinum, and sometimes Diamond awards, in ascending order; the UK also has a Silver certification, ranking below Gold. In most cases, a "Multi-Platinum" or "Multi-Diamond" award is given for multiples of the Platinum or Diamond requirements.

Many music industries around the world are represented by the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI). The IFPI operates in 66 countries and services affiliated industry associations in 45 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = 2010-05-18
 | publisher = [[IFPI]]
 | title = IFPI's Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the IFPI is merely affiliated with the already operational certification bodies of a country, but in many others countries with lesser-developed industries, the IFPI acts as the sole certifying body servicing the country or region's music industry. Still other countries not represented by the IFPI have certifying bodies operating independently, such as individual record companies which service the country or region's music industry as a whole.

Though all certifying bodies give awards for [[album]] sales or shipments, many also certify [[Single (music)|singles]], paid [[Music download|digital download]]s, [[music video]]s, music [[DVD]]s, and [[Audio mastering|master]] [[ringtone]]s. Additionally, some certifying bodies have separate threshold scales for works of domestic or international origins, varying genres, lengths, and formats. From the 2010s digital streaming was included in some territories.

'''Lucille Caudill Little''' (August 20, 1909 &amp;ndash; October 8, 2002), a [[Patronage#Arts|patron of the arts]] and philanthropist who served as president of the W. Paul and Lucille Caudill Little Foundation in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].

==Biography==
Mary Lucille Caudill was born in 1909 in [[Morehead, Kentucky|Morehead]], the county seat of [[Rowan County, Kentucky]]. She was one of five children (sisters Dr. Claire Louise Caudill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kentuckystewarts.com/RowanCounty/LouiseCaudill1994.htm | title = Louise Caudill | accessdate=2011-05-30 | publisher = Alexander Stewart Family of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Patricia Caudill Eubank; and, brothers Boone Proctor Caudill and Dr. Charles Milton Caudill) of Rosetta Proctor and Judge Daniel Boone Caudill.  Her father was a lawyer and a banker as well as a popular circuit judge of the Twenty-First District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kentuckystewarts.com/RowanCounty/CaudillElectionDispute1933.htm | title = 1933 Rowan County Election Dispute 1933 | accessdate=2011-05-30 | publisher = Alexander Stewart Family of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended elementary and high school in [[Morehead, Kentucky|Morehead]] and graduated from [[Hamilton College (Kentucky)|Hamilton College]], a girls finishing school in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. In the 1920s she attended eleven colleges, including [[Transylvania College]], the [[University of Kentucky]], Morehead College (now [[Morehead State University]]), and studied voice at [[Stetson College]] in Florida.  She was a member of [[Pi Beta Phi]], having been initiated into the chapter at the Ohio State University.&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of Pi Beta Phi'', 1951, p. 98. Her sister Dr. C. Louise Caudill was also a member of the Ohio Beta (Ohio State University) Chapter of Pi Beta Phi.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 she earned a bachelor's degree in voice from [[Ohio State University]], took graduate courses at [[Columbia University]] and then at [[Juilliard School of Music]] (where she earned a scholarship). She continued her studies in New York with vocal scientist Dr. Douglas Stanley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEvX3VYay8g | title = Douglas Stanley &amp; Nelson Eddy vocal technique demonstration | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | date = 2009-09-01 | publisher = YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Lily Pons]] as accompanist. After performing in New York, she served on the faculty of [[Morehead State University|Morehead State Teachers College]] where she taught speech and started up the department of theatre. Later, she served as a volunteer teacher at a P-12 private school in Lexington, [[Sayre School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ket.org/arts/lucillelittle.htm | title = Lucile Caudill Little | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | publisher = Kentucky Educational Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married W. Paul Little, a businessman and thoroughbred breeder, in 1937 at the age of 28 and they made [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], in the heart of the Bluegrass state, their home. Paul Little was a successful thoroughbred breeder and owner, having bred Wild Again and 28 other stakes winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/11957/lexington-philanthropist-wife-of-breeder-paul-little-dead-at-93 | title = Lexington Philanthropist, Wife of Breeder Paul Little, Dead at 93 | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | last = Goode | first = Kristin Ingwell | date = 2002-10-09 | publisher = The Blood-Horse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 she was kidnapped by a young man whose father worked at Paul Little's tobacco warehouse in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].  She went to the bank to collect her own ransom of $85,000 and told the police.  They followed and, while she was on the floor in the backseat of her own car, exchanged fire with the kidnapper.

After her husband's death in 1990, Mrs. Little was the sole heir to a large fortune. In 1999, the W. Paul &amp; Lucille Caudill Little Foundation was the 9th-ranked foundation in Kentucky by total dollars donated.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kentuckystewarts.com/RowanCounty/LucilleCaudill.htm | title = Lucille Caudill: 'I Have Called Myself a College Tramp' | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | last = Lane | first = Ed | date = October 2001 | work = One-on-One | publisher = The Alexander Stewart Family of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Because of her training in the arts, Little focused the Paul &amp; Lucille Caudill Little Foundation in the areas of the arts and education.  The purpose of the foundation is to develop creativity mainly through the fine arts.  The Foundation was originally handled by the Bank of the Bluegrass and Trust Company, and today by the [http://bgcf.org Blue Grass Community Foundation]. Gifts are awarded quarterly to nonprofit organizations that have been in existence for at least three years.  The organizations must serve in and around Central and Eastern Kentucky, specifically Fayette, Rowan or Elliott County. Grants tend to range in amount from $5,000 to $1 million. In May 2011, however, the Foundation announced the largest awards ever presented: $2.5 million each for the Lexington Children's Theatre (Shooting Star Youtheatre outreach to Rowan and Elliott Counties) and for Morehead State University's scholarships for students primarily from Rowan or Elliott County who pursue a bachelor of arts degree in art, music or theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lanereport.com/articles/fastlane_article.cfm?id=263 | title = Little Foundation bestows $2.5M apiece to endow Morehead State, Lexington Children's Theater to promote drama in Rowan, Elliott counties | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | date = 2011-05-25 | work = The Lane Report | publisher = Lane Communications Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her involvement in the cultural life of central Kentucky led to the establishment of several entities. She founded and led the following:
* [http://www.lctonstage.org/ Lexington Children's Theatre], founded in 1939 (director in 1940),
* [http://www.studioplayers.org/ Studio Players], founded in 1952 (director),
* Lexington Council on Social Planning (president),
* Lexington Symphony (board member),
* [[Lexington Philharmonic]], founded in 1961 as the Central Kentucky Philharmonic Orchestra (board member),
* Bluegrass Girl Scout Council, now [http://www.gskentucky.org/ Wilderness Road Council] (president),
* Society of Fellows of the [http://www.lexarts.org Lexington Arts and Cultural Council], created out of 21 organizations in 1972 (board member),
* [http://www.lexarts.org/resources/artscene/ ArtsPlace] (board member),
* [http://www.ckyo.org Central Kentucky Youth Orchestra], founded in 1947 (board member),
* [http://www.lasclex.org Living Arts &amp; Science Center], founded in 1968 (board member)

Her leadership was invaluable to the following organizations:
* [[National Society of Arts and Letters]]
* Board of Trustees at [[Transylvania University]]
* Board of Trustees at [[Midway College]]
* Board of Directors of the [http://www.bankofthebluegrass.com Bank of the Bluegrass]
* [http://www.uky.edu/Libraries University of Kentucky] Library Associates Executive Committee
* [http://lexingtonopera.com/ Lexington Opera Society]
* Board of Directors, The Henry Clay Memorial Foundation at [http://www.henryclay.org Ashland, the Henry Clay Estate].

She also enjoyed singing as the soprano soloist at Central Christian Church in Lexington.

Numerous Kentucky entities have benefited from her generous contributions, including [[the Lexington Ballet]], the Opera Guild of Central Kentucky, the Headley-Whitney Museum, the Central Kentucky Women's Club, Hospice of the Bluegrass, the Salvation Army, United Campus Ministries, Lexington Theological Seminary, Midway College, First Christian Church, St. Clair Medical Center in Morehead, the Lexington Arts and Cultural Council, Lexington Musical Theatre and the Actors Guild of Lexington.  The Foundation established a permanent endowment at [[Kentucky Educational Television]] to integrate the performing arts into Kentucky's elementary education.

Even larger projects include a $1-million donation to the University of Kentucky in the 1990s to establish a combined fine arts library.  Her gift was matched by Mr. William T. Young and the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education's Research Challenge Initiative, resulting in the Lucille Caudill Little Fine Arts Library and the Learning Center Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/libpage.php?lweb_id=104&amp;llib_id=7&lt;ab_id=611 | title = About the Lucille Little Library | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | date = 2010-03-03 | publisher = University of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Little Library is the home of the [http://www.uky.edu/FineArts/Music/Niles John Jacob Niles Center for American Music].

The Lucille C. Little Theater at Transylvania University, where she was a member of the class of 1928. Another gift of $1 million to the Kentucky Horse Park Foundation will endow the International Museum of the Horse with the W. Paul Little Cultural and Learning Center. She has endowed the Lillian H. Press Distinguished Speakers Series at [[Centre College]], and recently gave $100,000 to the Commonwealth Institute for Parent Leadership.

Mrs. Little conceived the horse-themed pendulum clock which was installed in Lexington's central branch of the public library.

When asked why she chose to give her donations to art organizations, she replied:

:I wish people could feel the power of the arts. That the arts can be in their living. It has been such a power in my life and has led me into such beautiful pathways, that I would like everybody to have the experience.&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt;

==Awards==
Little received honorary doctorate degrees from [[Transylvania University]], [[Georgetown College (Kentucky)|Georgetown College]], the [[University of Kentucky]], and [[Morehead State University]].  She was awarded the Lexington Optimist Club Cup. Her portrait was installed in the Kentucky capitol in the Kentucky Commission on Women's [https://web.archive.org/web/20120311200600/http://women.ky.gov/about/kwr.htm Kentucky Women Remembered] exhibit in March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lyneart.com/KYWOMEN.HTM | title = Alison Lyne Portraits of 2002 Kentucky Women Remembered Honorees for Kentucky Commission on Women | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | publisher = Lyne Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Madonna del Prato''''' (''Madonna of the Meadow'') is a 1505 painting of the [[Virgin Mary]] and the [[Christ Child]] by [[Giovanni Bellini]], now in the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name=natgallery/&gt; Originally painted as oil and egg tempera on wood, it was [[transfer of panel paintings|transferred]] to canvas in 1949,&lt;ref name=giotto&gt;{{cite book|title=Giotto to Dürer: Early Renaissance Painting in The National Gallery |first1=Jill

It presents a medieval iconography of the Virgin of humility seated before a full and shining rural panorama, with both the devotional aspect and the landscape aspect given equal prominence. Full of small details of everyday life, this landscape contributes to the intimate and familiar tone of the two figures. The vulture in the tree also possibly symbolises death. The figures' poses invite meditation on Jesus's death and passion, recalling [[Pietà]] compositions with the dead adult Jesus in his mother's lap.

==Focus==
The book focuses on [[brand]]ing and often makes connections with the alter-globalization movement. Throughout the four parts ("No Space", "No Choice", "No Jobs", and "No Logo"), Klein writes about issues such as [[sweatshop]]s in the [[Americas]] and [[Asia]], [[culture jamming]], [[corporate censorship]], and [[Reclaim the Streets]]. She pays special attention to the deeds and misdeeds of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[The Gap (clothing retailer)|The Gap]], [[McDonald's Corporation|McDonald's]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], and [[Microsoft]] – and of their lawyers, contractors, and [[advertising agency|advertising agencies]]. Many of the ideas in Klein's book derive from the influence of the [[Situationist International|Situationists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/04/23/reviews/000423.23ledbett.html|title=Brand Names|website=www.nytimes.com|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; an art/political group founded in the late 1950s.

However, while globalization appears frequently as a recurring theme, Klein rarely addresses the topic of [[globalization]] itself, and when she does, it is usually indirectly. She goes on to discuss globalization in much greater detail in her book, ''[[Fences and Windows]]'' ([[2002 in literature|2002]]).

==Summary==
The book comprises four sections: "No Space", "No Choice", "No Jobs", and "No Logo". The first three deal with the negative effects of brand-oriented corporate activity, while the fourth discusses various methods people have taken in order to fight back.

==="No Space"===
The book begins by tracing the history of brands. Klein argues that there has been a shift in the usage of branding and gives examples of this shift to "anti-brand" branding. Early examples of brands were often used to put a recognizable face on factory-produced products. These slowly gave way to the idea of selling lifestyles. According to Klein, in response to an economic crash in the 1980s (due to the [[Latin American debt crisis]], [[Black Monday (1987)]], the [[savings and loan crisis]], and the [[Japanese asset price bubble]]), corporations began to seriously rethink their approach to marketing and to target the youth demographic, as opposed to the [[baby boomers]], who had previously been considered a much more valuable segment.

The book discusses how brand names such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Pepsi]] expanded beyond the mere products which bore their names, and how these names and logos began to appear everywhere. As this happened, the brands' obsession with the youth market drove them to further associate themselves with whatever the youth considered "cool". Along the way, the brands attempted to associate their names with everything from movie stars and athletes to grassroots social movements.

Klein argues that large [[multinational corporation]]s consider the marketing of a brand name to be more important than the actual manufacture of products; this theme recurs in the book, and Klein suggests that it helps explain the shift to production in [[Third World]] countries in such industries as clothing, footwear, and computer hardware.

This section also looks at ways in which brands have "muscled" their presence into the school system, and how in doing so, they have pipelined advertisements into the schools and used their position to gather information about the students. Klein argues that this is part of a trend toward targeting younger and younger consumers.

==="No Choice"===
In the second section, Klein discusses how brands use their size and clout to limit the number of choices available to the public – whether through market dominance (e.g., [[Wal-Mart]]) or through aggressive invasion of a region (e.g., [[Starbucks]]). Klein argues that each company's goal is to become the dominant force in its respective field. Meanwhile, other corporations, such as [[Sony]] or [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], simply open their own chains of stores, preventing the competition from even putting their products on the shelves.

This section also discusses the way that corporations merge with one another in order to add to their ubiquity and provide greater control over their image. [[ABC News]], for instance, is allegedly under pressure not to air any stories that are overly critical of Disney, its parent company. Other chains, such as Wal-Mart, often threaten to pull various products off their shelves, forcing manufacturers and publishers to comply with their demands. This might mean driving down manufacturing costs or changing the artwork or content of products like magazines or albums so they better fit with Wal-Mart's image of family friendliness.

Also discussed is the way that corporations abuse [[copyright law]]s in order to silence anyone who might attempt to criticize their brand.

==="No Jobs"===
In this section, the book takes a darker tone and looks at the way in which manufacturing jobs move from local factories to foreign countries, and particularly to places known as [[Free trade zone|export processing zones]]. Such zones often have no labor laws, leading to dire working conditions.

The book then shifts back to [[North America]], where the lack of manufacturing jobs has led to an influx of work in the service sector, where most of the jobs are for minimum wage and offer no benefits. The term "[[McJob]]" is introduced, defined as a job with poor compensation that does not keep pace with inflation, inflexible or undesirable hours, little chance of advancement, and high levels of stress. Meanwhile, the public is being sold the perception that these jobs are temporary employment for students and recent graduates, and therefore need not offer living wages or benefits.

All of this is set against a backdrop of massive profits and wealth being produced within the corporate sector. The result is a new generation of employees who have come to resent the success of the companies they work for. This resentment, along with rising unemployment, labour abuses abroad, disregard for the environment, and the ever-increasing presence of advertising breeds a new disdain for corporations.

==="No Logo"===
The final section of the book discusses various movements that have sprung up during the 1990s. These include ''[[Adbusters]]'' magazine and the [[culture-jamming]] movement, as well as [[Reclaim the Streets]] and the [[McLibel]] trial. Less radical protests are also discussed, such as the various movements aimed at putting an end to [[sweatshop]] labour.

Klein concludes by contrasting consumerism and citizenship, opting for the latter. "When I started this book," she writes, "I honestly didn't know whether I was covering marginal atomized scenes of resistance or the birth of a potentially broad-based movement. But as time went on, what I clearly saw was a movement forming before my eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klein|first1=Naomi|title=No space, no choice, no jobs, no logo : taking aim at the brand bullies|date=2009|publisher=Vintage Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=9780307399090|page=443|edition=10th anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
After the book's release, Klein was heavily criticized by the news magazine ''[[The Economist]]'', leading to a broadcast debate with Klein and the magazine's writers, dubbed "No Logo vs. Pro Logo".&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.wnyc.org/news/articles/4390 WNHC News Debate: Pro Logo vs. No Logo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2004 in literature|2004]] book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'' (published as ''Nation of Rebels'' in the United States) specifically criticized ''No Logo'', stating that turning the improving quality of life in the working class into a fundamentally anti-market ideology is shallow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rebel Sell|last=Heath|first=Joseph|last2=Potter|first2=Andrew|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=2004|isbn=1841126551|location=Ontario|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this book, Klein criticized [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] so severely that Nike published a point-by-point response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml|title=NikeBiz {{!}} Labor {{!}} No Logo Letter|date=2001-06-18|access-date=2017-07-15|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010618162615/http://nikebiz.com/labor/nologo_let.shtml|archivedate=2001-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2000, ''No Logo'' was short-listed for the [[Guardian First Book Award|''Guardian'' First Book Award]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/firstbook2000/0,,345809,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Guardian First Book Award 2000 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the book won the following awards:

==Video==
Naomi Klein explains her ideas in the 40-minute video ''No Logo – Brands, Globalization &amp; Resistance'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]), directed by [[Sut Jhally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=No Logo – Brands, Globalization &amp; Resistance|author=Jhally, Sut (Director) &amp; Klein, Naomi|date=2003|isbn=1-893521-85-0 |url=http://www.mediaed.org/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Members of the English rock group [[Radiohead]] have stated that the book influenced them particularly during the making of their fourth and fifth albums, ''[[Kid A]]'' (2000) and ''[[Amnesiac (album)|Amnesiac]]'' (2001), respectively. (The albums were recorded over the same sessions.) The band recommended the book to fans on their website and considered calling the album ''Kid A'' "No Logo" for a time.&lt;ref name="ECCLESTON"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Eccleston|first=Danny|title=(Radiohead article)|work=Q Magazine|date=October 2000|url=http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2000&amp;cutting=89&amp;PHPSESSID=c033bc19e81ba698894f33e264541fc4|accessdate=2007-03-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311024424/http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2000&amp;cutting=89&amp;PHPSESSID=c033bc19e81ba698894f33e264541fc4|archivedate=2007-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dhani Harrison]], son of [[George Harrison]] and front-man of English electronic/alternative rock group [[Thenewno2]], has stated that ''No Logo'' had a large influence on their release, ''[[You Are Here (Thenewno2 album)|You Are Here]]'' (2008).{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Argentine-American rock singer [[Kevin Johansen]] wrote a song, "Logo", inspired by Klein's book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3664">In [[fashion]] and [[clothing]], a '''petite size''' is a [[US standard clothing size|standard clothing size]] designed to fit women of shorter height than the average, typically {{convert|160|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}.

==Changes in pattern measurements and design==

Regular female sized [[clothing]] is designed for a woman at least {{convert|165|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} tall (without shoes) and will not fit a woman of significantly shorter height well.  Even if the bust, waist and hip circumferences are appropriate, the sleeve lengths, leg [[inseam]] lengths and vertical torso measurements (such as the back length and bust-waist length) must be altered significantly to fit well. Non-petite size dresses cannot be easily altered to produce the equivalent petite size, since, in general, these lengths (particularly the critical torso measurements) cannot be altered without introducing an unsightly seam. Significant errors in the torso measurements will make a well-fitted look impossible, e.g., if the bust-point darts are off by three inches.

In addition to its measurements, a petite-size garment may have a different ''design'' from those intended for taller women.  For example, style elements may be added to give a longer, slimmer look, e.g., vertical stripes, princess seams, short skirts, large patterns or patterns arranged helically around the whole body.  Unfortunately, many modern "petite" sizes are actually renamed [[US standard clothing size|half sizes]] intended for large women and, as a result, tend to be boxy and unfashionable for small-framed women.  Designs for taller women may also have [[style line]]s that appear to shorten the figure, such as horizontal lines (e.g., clamdigger pants or midcalf skirts); hence, even if the measurements are adjusted correctly, a petite-size version of a regular-size garment may be unflattering.

==Frequency==

The average height of an American woman is roughly {{convert|163|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} (5'4"), with a standard deviation of roughly {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}}.  Thus, 40% of all American women are {{convert|160|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} or shorter (&lt;math&gt;z &lt;= -0.25&lt;/math&gt;) and  roughly one-quarter (25%) are {{convert|155|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} or shorter (&lt;math&gt;z &lt;= -0.75&lt;/math&gt;).  

In the UK and throughout much of Europe and Australasia, the average height varies from {{convert|152|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} to {{convert|168|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}.  The old clothes sizes tended to correspond to the UK's 1951 size survey, which took {{convert|157|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} as average height, and also took a slim, hour glass figure as standard.  In the 1990s the Size UK project examined 16,000 people and changed the measurements for the 'average' size.  This was widely reported, but stores responded to the headline (people getting bigger) rather than the facts (height rising only slightly but many individuals fatter). The fashion industry provides most of its merchandise in "standard sizes", which encompasses women sizes 4-14, 5'4" to 5'8" in height (European sizes 34-44 and 1.6256-1.7272 m), because this is the most profitable ready-to-wear market.&lt;ref name="Fashion For Real Women"&gt;[http://www.fashionforrealwomen.com/articles/petite_plus_tall_size.html Petite, Plus, or Tall Size'”]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rick Santorum official photo.jpg|thumb|upright|Rick Santorum]]

Former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] and [[Rick Santorum presidential campaign, 2012|2012]] and [[Rick Santorum presidential campaign, 2016|2016 U.S. Presidential candidate]] [[Rick Santorum]] is opposed to [[homosexual behavior]], seeing it as antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family. Santorum does not believe the [[right to privacy]] under the [[United States Constitution]] covers sexual acts, and criticized the [[US Supreme Court]] ruling in the case of ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' that ruled to the contrary.&lt;ref name="under fire"&gt;{{cite news|last=Loughlin|first=Sean|title=Santorum under fire for comments on homosexuality|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/04/22/santorum.gays/|publisher=CNN|date=April 22, 2003|accessdate=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="defends comments"&gt;{{cite news|title=Santorum defends comments on homosexuality|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/04/23/santorum.gays/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=April 23, 2003|accessdate=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum has stated that the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]]'s "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" policy, which ended in 2011, should be reinstated and has voiced his opposition to [[same-sex parenting]]. Santorum's views provoked criticism from Democratic politicians and other groups, but have been supported by some conservative Christians.

==2003 interview==
In the interview by Associated Press reporter Lara Jakes Jordan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farah|first=Joseph|title=Santorum is right|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=32268|work=World Net Daily|date=April 28, 2003|accessdate=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; when asked for his position on the [[Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal]], Santorum said that the scandal involved priests and post-pubescent men in "a basic homosexual relationship" (rather than [[Sexual abuse#Child sexual abuse|child sexual abuse]]), which led the interviewer to ask if homosexuality should be outlawed.&lt;ref name="usa today"&gt;{{cite news|title=Excerpt from Santorum interview|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm|work=USA Today|agency=Associated Press |date=April 23, 2003|accessdate=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santorum then brought up the then-pending [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which challenged a Texas [[sodomy law]], and said that "he did not have a problem with homosexuals, but a problem with homosexual acts", "the right to privacy doesn't exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution", and "sodomy laws properly exist to prevent acts which undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family."&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt;&lt;ref name="national review"&gt;{{cite web|last=George|first=Robert P.|title=Rick Santorum Is Right|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-george052703.asp|work=[[The National Review]]|date=May 27, 2003|accessdate=March 13, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323095514/http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-george052703.asp|archivedate=March 23, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jordan asked "Okay, without being too gory or graphic, so if somebody is homosexual, you would argue that they should not have sex?" Santorum stated:&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt;
{{quote|In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. And when you destroy that you have a dramatic impact on the quality.}}

The AP also quoted Santorum as saying, "If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to [[polygamy]], you have the right to [[incest]], you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything." and "Whether it's polygamy, whether it's adultery, whether it's sodomy, all of those things, are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family."&lt;ref name="under fire"/&gt;

When allegations of bias were leveled against Jordan because she is married to a Democratic strategist,&lt;ref&gt;WorldNetDaily: [https://web.archive.org/web/20060619135610/http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=32268 Joseph Farah, "Santorum is Right," April 28, 2003], accessed March 4, 2012.

==Public reaction==
Santorum's comments evoked responses ranging from [[George W. Bush]]'s remark, relayed through spokesperson [[Ari Fleischer]], that "the President believes that the senator is an inclusive man",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Santorum and gays|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/04/26/santorum_quotes/|work=[[Salon.com]]|date=April 26, 2003|accessdate=March 13, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606225221/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/04/26/santorum_quotes/|archivedate=June 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to sharp criticism from former [[Governor of Vermont]] [[Howard Dean]] that "[[gay-bashing]] is not a legitimate public policy discussion; it is immoral", to conservative groups such as the [[Family Research Council]] and [[Concerned Women for America]] who came to Santorum's defense.&lt;ref name="defends comments"/&gt;

In a follow-up statement released after the Associated Press interview was published, Santorum said some of his remarks were "taken out of context", and defended his comments in the interview asserting "It is simply a reflection of the law."&lt;ref name="santorumdefends"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/04/23/santorum.gays/index.html|accessdate=May 12, 2011|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|work=[[CNN]]|title=Santorum defends comments on homosexuality|date=April 23, 2003|first=Sean |last=Loughlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Fox News Channel]]'', Santorum said he was not going to apologize for his remarks, "I do not need to give an apology based on what I said and what I'm saying now – I think this is a legitimate public policy discussion. These are not ridiculous comments. These are very much a very important point."&lt;ref name="santorumandgays"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Salon.com|Salon]]|title=Santorum and gays|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/04/26/santorum_quotes/|accessdate=May 12, 2011|date=April 26, 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606225221/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/04/26/santorum_quotes/|archivedate=June 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, during an interview on the [[Rachel Maddow Show]], he expressed regret for associating homosexuality with bestiality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advocate.com/politics/election/2015/07/22/watch-rick-santorum-regrets-man-dog-remark-sort&lt;/ref&gt;

Santorum defended his remarks, declaring that his comments were not intended to equate homosexuality with incest and adultery, but rather to challenge the specific legal position that the right to privacy prevents the government from regulating consensual acts among adults, a position he disputes, because he does not believe that there is a general constitutional right to privacy.&lt;ref name="defends comments"/&gt;

===Campaign for a "santorum" neologism ===
{{main|Campaign for the neologism "santorum"}}
[[Dan Savage]], a widely syndicated columnist who was offended by Santorum's remarks, hosted a contest in his ''[[Savage Love]]'' column for readers to create a definition for "santorum". He created a website, ''spreadingsantorum.com'', for the winning definition, "The frothy mix of [[personal lubricant|lube]] and [[fecal matter]] that is sometimes the byproduct of [[anal sex]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Molloy |first=Tim |title=Rick Santorum still haunted by Google problem despite strong showing in Iowa |agency=Reuters |publisher=National Post |date=2012-01-04 |url= http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/01/04/rick-santorum-still-haunted-by-google-problemdespite-strong-showing-in-iowa/ |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became a top internet search result for ''santorum'' in 2003, displacing the Senator's official website on many [[Web search engines|search engines]], including Google, Yahoo!

==2012 presidential campaign==
While campaigning in New Hampshire, Santorum engaged college students who asked about his position on same-sex marriage and suggested that allowing it would lead to the legalization of polygamy and other forms of marriage. The exchange resulted in him being booed at the conclusion of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-06/santorum-draws-boos-opposing-gay-marriage-before-college-crowd.html|title=Santorum Draws Boos From College Crowd for Opposing Gay Marriage |first=Julianna |last=Goldman |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At another event, Santorum said that children would be better off having a father in prison than being raised by lesbian parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9000510/US-election-2012-Rick-Santorum-under-pressure-in-New-Hampshire-over-social-stances.html |title=US election 2012: Rick Santorum under pressure in New Hampshire over social stances |first=Jon |last=Swaine |date=January 8, 2012 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 2011, during a Republican primary debate in Orlando, Florida, Santorum replied to a question posed by a [[Stephen Snyder-Hill|gay soldier]] deployed in Iraq who asked the candidates whether, as president, they would take measures to "circumvent" the repeal of "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]".

{{quote|I would say any type of sexual activity has absolutely no place in the military," Santorum responded. "And the fact that they're making a point to include it as a provision within the military that we are going to recognize a group of people and give them a special privilege to – and removing 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' I think tries to inject social policy into the military. And the military's job is to do one thing, and that is to defend our country .... What we're doing is playing social experimentation with our military right now. And that's tragic.}}

'''Roosevelt Red Ware''', also known as '''Salado Red Ware''' and '''Salado Polychrome''', is a late prehistoric [[pottery]] tradition found across large portions of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]]. The [[archaeological culture|tradition]] involves the combination of red, white, and black [[paint]] in varying configurations along with compositional and morphological characteristics.  This ceramic tradition begins about AD 1280-1290 and lasts until at least AD 1450 based on [[Dendrochronology|tree-ring]] dating.

==History==
[[Archaeologist]]s have argued over the nature of Salado as a cultural phenomenon or an ideological one spreading through the Southwest.  Some archaeologists have chosen to use the term Salado Polychromes so as not to give undue emphasis to the Roosevelt Lake area, once thought to be the center of production. Both terms, Salado Red Ware and Roosevelt Red Ware are still used by archaeologists.

In her 1994 volume, Dr. Patricia Crown suggested four models with which to analyze Salado Polychromes.  They are "elite symbols of authority or items of exchange," "indicators of participation in an economic alliance/regional system," "objects associated with the spread of a religious ideology," and as "markers of ethnicity for a migrant group" (Crown 1994: vi). More recently archaeologists have examined these types distribution across the Southwest (Lyons 2003) and suggests that these types are markers of migrant groups emanating from northeastern Arizona.

==Ceramic typology==
Roosevelt Red Ware is divided by archaeologists into a series of [[Typology (archaeology)|types]], which cover shorter spans of time, based on configurations of the painted designs and rim profiles of bowls.
Roosevelt Red Ware has traditionally been organized into three types based on stylistic differences. More recently researchers at [http://www.archaeologysouthwest.org/ Archaeology Southwest] (previously named the Center for Desert Archaeology) in Tucson, Arizona have identified an additional six types based on a combination of stylistic and morphological characteristics. For bowls with both interior and exterior decoration, the exterior style is labeled as the variant (Example: Gila interior with a Tonto exterior would be labeled as Gila Polychrome: Tonto Variant)

All types within this ware share a number of broad categorical similarities although over a roughly 250 year time span significant variation is seen. The paste is generally brown to reddish-brown in color and is tempered with sand. Generally red and/or white slip cover both the interior and exterior and black paint is used on one or both surfaces, usually surrounded by white rather than red slip. Black paint is most commonly organic, but a mixture of organic and mineral paint appears on some vessels. Petrographic analyses have shown that Roosevelt Red Ware is produced across the full distributional range.

===Pinto Polychrome===
Pinto Polychrome is the earliest of the Roosevelt Red Wares and dates from AD 1280 to 1330. Pinto Polychrome vessels are only found in the form of bowls and lack the banding line, also called a "life-line" by some authors, that identify Gila Polychrome. Stylistically Pinto Polychrome is reminiscent of St Johns Polychrome in its layout of opposed hatched and solid elements, although the type exhibits a period of experimentation with colors and layouts that continue through subsequent types.

Pinto polychrome is found along the [[Mogollon Rim]] in Arizona as well as the [[Tonto Basin]], [[Sierra Ancha]], [[Globe Highlands]], [[San Pedro Valley (Arizona)|San Pedro Valley]], [[Point of Pines Sites|Point of Pines Area]], [[Kinishba Ruins|Kinishba Area]] and the [[Upper Gila Valley]] (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 34).

There is a transitional variant that has been noted by some authors known as Pinto-Gila Polychrome. This type exhibits the more bold designs generally found in Gila Polychrome but lacks the banding line and is still only found in bowls. Some authors have chosen not to use this type arguing that types tend to blur in transitional periods between types and that adding types adds no additional analytical usefulness. Pinto Polychrome is also contains a Salmon Variety (see Gila Polychrome).

===Pinto Black-on-red===
Similar in dates, designs, and geographic distribution to Pinto Polychrome but without the white slip underlying black paint.

===Gila Polychrome===
[[File:Tonto polychrome jar.jpg|thumb|right|Tonto Polychrome jar (olla), Tonto National Monument]]
Gila Polychrome is the first type in this series to be found in both bowls and jars. Stylistically Gila Polychrome is identified by bolder motifs than Pinto Polychrome and bowls are most readily identified by the banding line just below the interior rim. Jars have broad stripes of white slip with black designs, although the bases are usually still slipped red. Sometimes jars exhibit multiple parallel bands of black on white decoration separated by thin bands of red slip. Gila Polychrome, Salmon Variety, replaces the usual white slip with a pinkish slip but otherwise remains stylistically similar (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 21-22).

Gila Polychrome is produced from about AD 1300-1450 across Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico, north of Casas Grandes, Chihuahua.

===Gila Black-on-red===
Similar in dates, designs and geographic distribution to Gila Polychrome but without the white slip underlying black paint.

===Tonto Polychrome===
Tonto Polychrome is found in higher frequencies on jars. The black on white designs are generally narrower bands than on Gila jars, or panels of decoration, and are surrounded by red slip. This type has a later starting date than Gila Polychrome, AD 1340 and an end date of 1450.

===Cliff Polychrome===
[[Image:Cliff_Bowl.png|thumb|right|Cliff Polychrome Bowl]]
Cliff Polychrome is identified by stylistic and morphological characteristics that distinguish it from Gila Polychrome.  Dates given for this type range from AD 1300-1450 (Lyons 2004).

This type is found in bowl form and can be partially identified by recurved and semi-flaring rims. Accompanying the shift in bowl shape is a drop in the banding line, creating a secondary design field between the banding line and the rim. Design elements otherwise are similar to those found on Gila and Tonto Polychrome vessels.

Lyons (2004) describes the spatial distribution for this type as ranging from [[Petrified National Forest]], Arizona to [[Casas Grandes]], Chihuahua, Mexico and from the Phoenix basin to [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]]. The locus of heaviest production for this type seems to be centered around southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico possibly indicating the location of origin for this type. Temporal distribution would seem to indicate that this type is temporally significant since sites exist throughout the distributional range containing both Gila and Tonto Polychrome, but lacking Cliff Polychrome.

===Nine Mile Polychrome===
Nine Mile Polychrome is similar to Cliff Polychrome in that it only occurs in bowls with a recurved rim with a black-on-white band of design on the bowl interior just below the rim, the area above the banding line on Cliff Polychrome. Unlike Cliff Polychrome however, the rest of the interior of this type is red slipped without any additional elaboration, including lack of a banding line. Generally Nine Mile Polychrome vessels have either a Gila or Tonto Polychrome exterior decoration. This type is found in the region from the Cliff Valley to Perry Mesa, and from the Middle Verde Valley to the area around Douglas, Arizona.  While rare, this type seems to have its greatest density around the far southeastern portion of its distribution. This type dates from the timer period AD 1375-1450 (Neuzil and Lyons 2005).

This type is named for the Nine Mile Site in the [[San Simon Valley]] excavated by Jack and Vera Mills in the 1940s.

===Phoenix Polychrome===
Phoenix Polychrome also occurs only in bowls with recurved rims. This type is similar to Nine Mile Polychrome with the difference being that Phoenix Polychrome lacks the band of black on white decoration on the interior of bowls and is instead entirely covered in red slip. As with other types, the exterior of these bowls may have either Gila or Tonto style decoration.

This type dates to AD 1375-1450 and as the name suggests its distribution centers on the Phoenix basin, but distribution extends east to the Cliff Valley and is extends from the Verde Valley in the north to the Douglas, Arizona area in the south (Neuzil and Lyons 2005).

===Dinwiddie Polychrome===
[[Image:Dinwiddie_Bowl.png|thumb|right|Dinwiddie Polychrome Bowl]]
Dinwiddie Polychrome is also defined by bowls with recurved rims and dates to AD 1375-1450. Decoration on this type is restricted to the exterior of vessels with the interior being smudged (Neuzil and Lyons 2005).

Dinwiddie Polychrome has a very restricted spatial distribution and may "not occur west of a line drawn through Kinishba, near Whiteriver, and the Nine Mile site, near [[Bowie, Arizona|Bowie]] [Arizona]" (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 30). In Crown’s 1994 study, although she did not name this type, she noted that Roosevelt Red Ware bowls exhibiting smudged interiors were confined to a limited geographical range.

===Los Muertos Polychrome===
Los Muertos Polchrome has a long and storied history of recognition without formal description. Neuzil and Lyons (2005) note that archaeologists have noted this type as a variation of Gila Polychrome since 1927. Names under which this type has been known include Gila Polychrome with four colors, Las Colinas Polychrome, Perry Mesa Polychrome, Gila style with red, and Gila Polychrome; Trichrome Variety.

This type is identified by red paint used in conjunction with black paint in white design fields. Design layout follows either Gila or Tonto styles and so is referred to with reference to either of these varieties. Distribution of this type is limited to the Verde Valley, the Agua Fria-Perry Mesa area, the Lower Salt River Valley, the Middle Gila, the Santa Cruz Flats, and the Tonto Basin (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 30-31).

===Cliff White-on-red===
Cliff White-on-red is also a recurved bowl form of Roosevelt Red Ware. The interior of the vessel is smudged on the interior and the exteriors exhibit the white-on-red decoration. Cliff White-on-red overlaps in distribution with Dinwiddie Polychrome and thus the range appears to be southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona.

Similar white-on-red types exist in the Southwest, although all show sufficient differences for Cliff White-on-red to hold up as a distinct type. This type is different from Gila White-on-red in that Cliff White-on-red is thinned by scraping rather than paddle-and-anvil, and designs are broader than those found on Gila White-on-red. Unlike Cliff White-on-red, Salado White-on-red is white decoration on a red-slipped obliterated corrugated body. Finally, Tularosa White-on-red is most similar to Cliff White-on-red with a smudged interior and a recurved rim form. The differences are that Tularosa White-on-red has two to four coils around the neck and thinner lines used in the designs. (Neuzil and Lyons 2005)

==Mexican Forms==
[[Image:Escondida Jar.gif|thumb|right|Escondida Polychrome Jar]]
In their exhaustive study of Casas Grandes, DiPeso, Rinaldo and Fenner (1974), the type Escondida Polychrome was formally named. While not officially a Roosevelt Red Ware, this type exhibits hallmark traits of these types. Escondida Polychrome is produced with locally available clay, a buff firing clay used for types such as Ramos Polychrome, and has black and red designs with many motifs being similar to those found on Roosevelt Red Wares. This type does lack the white slip found on Roosevelt Red Ware, and designs show influence from Chihuahuan types. Escondida Polychrome may be a hybrid type taking aspects of both Roosevelt Red Wares and Chihuahuan wares and being locally produced in northern Mexico.

A second type, unnamed yet, is similar to Escondida Polychrome but exhibits the white slip found on Roosevelt Red Ware. Fenner (personal communication) feels that these vessels are most likely locally produced Roosevelt Red Wares and as such would be found under one of the above headings, although sherds would exhibit the buff-colored paste found in the region.

'''''Senja di Jakarta''''' ({{lang-en|Twilight in Jakarta}}) is an [[Indonesian literature|Indonesian novel]] written by [[Mochtar Lubis]] and first published in [[English language|English]] by [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson &amp; Co.]] in [[1963 in literature|1963]], with a translation by [[Claire Holt (art historian)|Claire Holt]]. It was later published in Indonesian in 1970.

==Writing==
''Senja di Jakarta'' was written while Mochtar Lubis was under [[house arrest]], as ordered by the [[Sukarno]] government. The manuscript was originally entitled ''Yang Terinjak dan Melawan'' ({{lang-en|Those Who are Stepped On and Fight Back}}), but the title was changed during translation.&lt;ref name=Mahayana&gt;{{harvnb|Mahayana|Sofyan|Dian|2007|pp=190–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Raden Kaslan, a member of the Indonesia Party, is told by the party leader Husin Limbara to raise funds for the next election. To do so, Kaslan creates fake companies to handle licensing the import of goods with his second wife Fatma, son Suryono and himself as directors. Through this [[fraud]], they raise much money for themselves and the party.

At his father's urging, Suryono quits his job at the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Indonesia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and soon becomes rich. He also becomes very [[promiscuous]], having sex with high-class [[prostitute]]s, married women, and his own stepmother.

Meanwhile, honest government workers like Idrus are unable to compete. Idrus receives little compensation, and his materialistic wife Dahlia is having an [[infidelity|affair]] with Suryono. The ''[[wong cilik]]'', including prostitute Neneng, coachman Pak Idjo, and garbagemen Saimun and Itam live in hunger, ignored by the [[social class|upper class]]. Despite the inequality, academics and cultural observers do nothing but discuss the social woes; they never take action.

Eventually, [[opposition (politics)|opposition]] newspapers uncover the corruption and fake companies used by the Indonesia Party. This causes the president to disband the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and some members of the Indonesia Party to join the opposition. Raden Kaslan is arrested, while Suryono and Fatma get into a car accident while trying to escape; Suryono dies of his wounds. Despite the fall of the Indonesia Party, the poor still suffer.

==Themes==
''Senja di Jakarta'' has been seen as drawing a parallel of 1950s Indonesia, under Sukarno's reign. The corruption, immorality, and abuse of power of the ruling class caused poverty within the general populace. These same themes are seen throughout the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mahayana|Sofyan|Dian|2007|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
Due to Lubis' imprisonment, ''Senja di Jakarta'' was originally published by [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson &amp; Co.]] as ''Twilight in Jakarta'' in 1963. From the English version, it was translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as ''Schemer over Djakarta'' by P.H. Fruithof. In 1964, it was released in [[Malay language|Malay]] as ''Sendja di Djakarta''. It was also translated into [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Korean language|Korean]] prior to being released in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] in 1970. Since then it has also been translated into [[Japanese language|Japanese]].&lt;ref name=Mahayana/&gt; Due to it originally being published in English, ''Senja di Jakarta'' has been described as Mochtar Lubis' best known work in the Western world.&lt;ref name=Balfas/&gt;

Critical reception was warm. [[A. Teeuw]] considered it one of Mochtar Lubis' finer works, and [[Ajip Rosidi]] later commented that the world press received it well.&lt;ref name=Mahayana/&gt; However, others such as [[M. Balfas]] described ''Senja di Jakarta'' as "[showing] that Mochtar Lubis' place is more in the world of newspapers and magazines than in that of literature proper."&lt;ref name=Balfas&gt;{{harvnb|Balfas|1976|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel was adapted for film by [[Nico Pelamonia]] as ''Sendja di Djakarta'' in 1967.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Nico Pelamonia}}

'''Suspense''' is a state of mental [[uncertainty]], [[anxiety]], of being [[Decision-making|undecided]], or of being [[Doubt|doubtful]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a [[Drama|dramatic work]], suspense is the [[anticipation]] of the [[wikt:outcome|outcome]] of a [[plot (narrative)|plot]] or of the solution to an uncertainty, [[puzzle]], or [[Mystery fiction|mystery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beckson|Ganz|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harmon|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Henry|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as it affects a character for whom one has [[sympathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harmon|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, suspense is not exclusive to fiction.

== In drama ==
In literature, films, television, and plays, suspense is a major device for securing and maintaining interest.  It may be of several major types:  in one, the outcome is uncertain and the suspense resides in the question of ''who, what, or how''; in another, the outcome is inevitable from foregoing events, and the suspense resides in the audience's anxious or frightened anticipation in the question of ''when''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harmon|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Readers feel suspense when they are deeply curious about ''what'' will happen next, or when they know what is likely to happen but don’t know ''how'' it will happen.  It would be difficult (and perhaps pointless) to write a piece of fiction in which there were not some issue the reader had a burning wish to find out about.  Consequently, even in [[historical fiction]], with characters whose life stories are well known, the ''why'' usually brings suspense to the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Henry|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An adjunct to suspense is [[foreshadowing]], as found in hints of national crisis or revolution in [[Isabel Allende]]’s ''[[House of the Spirits]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
* In [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (429 B.C.), suspense is achieved through a withholding of the knowledge that Oedipus himself has killed Laius, his father.

== Paradox of suspense ==
Some authors have tried to explain the "paradox of suspense", namely: a narrative tension that remains effective even when uncertainty is neutralized, because repeat audiences know exactly how the story resolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baroni|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brewer|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerrig|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Walton|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Yanal|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some theories assume that true repeat audiences are extremely rare because, in reiteration, we usually forget many details of the story and the interest arises due to these holes of memory;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brewer|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; others claim that uncertainty remains even for often told stories because, during the immersion in the fictional world, we forget fictionally what we know factually&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Walton|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because we expect fictional worlds to look like the real world, where exact repetition of an event is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerrig|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of Yanal is more radical and postulates that narrative tension that remains effective in true repetition should be clearly distinguished from genuine suspense, because uncertainty is part of the definition of suspense. Baroni proposes to name ''rappel'' this kind of suspense whose excitement relies on the ability of the audience to anticipate perfectly what is to come, a precognition that is particularly enjoyable for children dealing with well-known fairy tales. Baroni adds that another kind of suspense without uncertainty can emerge with the occasional contradiction between what the reader knows about the future (cognition) and what he desires (volition), especially in tragedy, when the protagonist eventually dies or fails (''suspense par contradiction'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baroni|2007|pp=279–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Circus''''' (French: ''Le Cirque'') is an oil on canvas painting by [[Georges Seurat]].  It was his last painting, made in a [[Neo-Impressionist]] style in 1890-91, and remained unfinished at his death in March 1891.  The painting is located at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris.

==Background==
The painting was Seurat's third major work treating the theme of the circus, after his ''[[Parade de cirque|Parade (Circus sideshow)]]'' of 1887-88 and ''[[Le Chahut]]'' of 1889-90. It depicts a female performer standing on a horse at the [[Circus Fernando]] (renamed the Circus Médrano in 1890, after its most famous clown).  The Circus Médrano was located at the corner of the [[Rue des Martyrs]] and the [[Boulevard de Rochechouart]], close to Seurat's studio.  It was a popular entertainment in Paris, depicted in the 1880s by other artists such as [[Renoir]] (for example, ''[[:File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir - Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg) - Google Art Project.jpg| Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg)]]''), [[Degas]] (for example, ''[[Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando]]'') and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] (for example, ''[[:File:Lautrec equestrienne (at the cirque fernando) 1887-8.jpg|Equestrienne (At the Circus Fernando)]]'').  

Seurat makes use of [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]]'s theories on the emotional and symbolic meaning of lines and colours, and the works of [[Chevreul]] and [[Ogden Rood]] on [[complementary colour]]s.  He was also influenced by Japanese prints, and the graphic works of [[Jules Chéret]].  The work is similar to [[chromolithograph]] ''Au cirque'' by [[Karl Gampenrieder]], but it is not clear if Seurat had seen it.

==Description==
The work measures {{convert|185|xx|152|cm}} (dimensions with frame painted by the artist: 232 x 198.5 cm). Seurat used a [[Neo-Impressionist]] [[Divisionist]] style, with [[pointillist]] dots creating the sense of other colours.  The work is dominated by white and the three [[primary colour]]s, mainly red and yellow with blue shading.  A deeper blue border painted around the edge of the canvas, merging into a flat frame in the same shade of blue.

The painting is divided into two spaces, with the circus artists occupying the lower right, characterised by curves and spirals creating a sense of movement, and the audience occupying the upper left, confined to rows of benches. The audience shows the distinctions between social classes sitting in rows, from the well-dressed higher classes near the front (sitting in the front row, in a top hat, is Seurat's friend and fellow painter [[Charles Angrand]]) to the lower classes in the gallery at the back.  

A sense of space is created by the [[Clown#Whiteface|whiteface]] clown in the foreground, facing away from the viewer, and the tiers of bleachers.   Another pair of clowns are tumbling to the right behind the ringmaster.

Seurat made few preparatory studies, concentrating on creating dynamic lines and using few colours.

==Reception==
''Le Cirque'' was first exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] in March 1891, in an unfinished state.  The work remained unfinished at Seurat's death a few days later: in places, the white ground and a grid of blue lines used by Seurat to create his composition are still visible.  Early critics complained that the subjects were stiff, like automatons.  Others later saw it as a forerunner of [[Cubism]]. 

The painting was returned to Seurat's mother after the exhibition in 1891, and she hung it in the room in the [[Boulevard de Magenta]] where he had died.  The painting was acquired by [[Paul Signac]] around 1900, and then by American collector [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], who donated the painting to [[the Louvre]] in 1927.  It was exhibited at the [[Musée du Luxembourg]], the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]] and the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|Galerie du Jeu de Paume]].  It has been located at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] since 1977.

'''''The Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence''''' is a 1558 painting by [[Titian]], now in the church of [[I Gesuiti]] in [[Venice]]. It so impressed [[Philip II of Spain]] that he commissioned a second version in 1567 for the basilica at [[El Escorial]].
