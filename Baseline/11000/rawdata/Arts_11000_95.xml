      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10208">'''6D BIM''', an acronym for 6D [[Building Information Modeling]] and a term widely used in the [[Construction]] industry, refers to the intelligent linking of individual [[3D CAD]] components or assemblies with all aspects of project life-cycle management information.&lt;ref name=6DBIM-R-01/&gt;&lt;ref name=6DBIM-R-02/&gt;&lt;ref name=6DBIM-R-04/&gt;&lt;ref name=6DBIM-R-07/&gt; 

The 6D model is usually delivered to the owner when a construction project is finished. The "As-Built" BIM model is populated with relevant building component information such as product data and details, maintenance/operation manuals, cut sheet specifications, photos, warranty data, web links to product online sources, manufacturer information and contacts, etc. This database is made accessible to the users/owners through a customized proprietary web-based environment. This is intended to aid facilities managers in the operation and maintenance of the facility.&lt;ref name=6DBIM-R-06/&gt;

The term is less commonly used in the UK and has been replaced with reference to the Asset Information Requirements (AIR) and an Asset Information Model (AIM) as specified in PAS1192-3:2014.
In some fora, the life-cycle management aspect is considered the 7th dimension, and energy, environmental, and sustainability aspects are labelled as the 6th dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Theory of Evolution BIM 3D-7D|url=https://bimestimate.eu/en/the-theory-of-evolution-bim-3d-7d/|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BIM 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D|url=http://www.bimpanzee.com/bim-3d-4d--5d--6d---7d.html|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ArtLifting is a [[benefit corporation]] founded by Liz Powers and her brother Spencer Powers in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/business/smallbusiness/homeless-artists-gallery-artlifting.html|title=Helping Homeless Artists Turn Around Their Fortunes|last=Rifkin|first=Glenn|date=2016-02-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; that connects socially conscious companies with talented artists impacted by [[homelessness]] or [[disabilities]]. ArtLifting is headquartered in [[Boston, MA]] but works with nearly 150 different artists across 30 different states.  

== History ==

ArtLifting co-founder, Liz Powers, began her mission in Boston when she was 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Jamie|title=#WOMENDOINGWELL LEADING LADY FEATURE: LIZ POWERS IS CHANGING THE WAY WE INVEST IN ART|url=http://womensilab.com/2015/01/13/womendoingwell-leading-lady-feature-liz-powers-is-changing-the-way-we-invest-in-art/|website=Women's ILab|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a sophomore in college, she joined LIFT, a national nonprofit organization that empowers families to break the cycle of poverty. There, Liz was trained to work with the homeless and helped clients grapple with housing issues, unemployment, and self-esteem. &lt;ref name="gazette article"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walsh|first1=Colleen|title=Art for artists’ sake|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/09/art-for-artists-sake/|website=Harvard Gazette|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liz noticed a pattern among her clients: many expressed that they were incredibly lonely. An artist herself, Liz wondered if art creation could be a solution to their loneliness. 

Through the support from a grant at Harvard, Liz embarked on a yearlong project establishing art groups in local shelters so that residents could come together, make art, and earn one another’s trust and companionship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/these-homeless-and-disabled-artists-are-getting-a-second-chance-618315843696|title=These Homeless and Disabled Artists Are Getting a Second Chance|last=|first=|date=|work=NBC News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liz was struck by the incredible talent that she saw in these programs and was saddened to learn that most works produced in these groups inevitably got discarded or ended up forgotten in the closets and basements of shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/business/smallbusiness/homeless-artists-gallery-artlifting.html|title=Helping Homeless Artists Turn Around Their Fortunes|last=Rifkin|first=Glenn|date=2016-02-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; After observing that the same problem existed at thousands of art programs across the country, Liz became committed to sharing artists’ creations with the world. In 2011 she created City Heart, an art show in Boston’s [[Prudential Center]] that brings together roughly 70 artists from eight local homeless shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artweekboston.org/event/city-heart-2/|title=City HeartArtWeek Boston|last=|first=|date=|website=www.artweekboston.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Powers wanted more.&lt;ref name="gazette article"/&gt; Liz’s brother Spencer, a 2007 graduate of [[Boston College]] and current student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s [[Sloan School of Management]], joined her to help with finances and logistics for the now-annual event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Bennett|title=BC Alum Spencer Powers Creates New Marketplace For Homeless, Disabled Artists|url=http://bcheights.com/metro/business/2015/bc-alum-spencer-powers-creates-new-marketplace-for-homeless-disabled-artists/|website=The Heights|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In November of 2013, the siblings founded ArtLifting with four Boston-based artists. During their first week of operations, those four artists earned thousands of dollars and were interviewed by national and local media. Liz and Spencer realized that art could be a transformational path to financial stability for these artists—they just needed a digital marketplace to connect with a larger audience. Since ArtLifting’s founding, the company has grown to support over 150 artists in 19 states.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artlifting.com/pages/about-us|title=ArtLifting - Buy Art, Change a Life.|website=www.artlifting.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, ArtLifting announced that it raised $1.1 million in seed funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ArtLifting Raises $1.1 Million To Help The Homeless Sell Their Art|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/27/artlifting-raises-1-1-million-to-help-the-homeless-and-other-disadvantaged-people-sell-their-art/|website = TechCrunch|accessdate = 2015-10-29|first = Megan Rose|last = Dickey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business Model==

ArtLifting offers artists impacted by [[homelessness]] or [[disability]] the opportunity to secure their own income through the sale of original paintings, prints, and products. By showcasing and selling artwork via ArtLifting.com, artists gain self-confidence that permeates all aspects of their lives.  

===Mission===

ArtLifting’s mission is to empower artists living with homelessness or disabilities through the celebration and sale of their artwork. ArtLifting is about creating opportunity, empowerment, and validation.

===Benefit Corporation Status===

ArtLifting was established as a [[for-profit]] [[benefit corporation]], rather than a [[non-profit]] [[501(c)3]]. Benefit corporations “have a corporate purpose to create a material positive impact on society and the environment; and are required to consider the impact of their decisions not only on shareholders but also on workers, community, and the environment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://baystatebanner.com/news/2016/nov/09/artlifting-combines-power-art-and-business/?banner-biz|title=Artlifting combines the power of art and business|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artlifting.com/pages/about-us|title=ArtLifting - Buy Art, Change a Life.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.artlifting.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies that are well-known for bringing about positive social or environmental impact are benefit corporations such as [[Patagonia]], [[Etsy]], and [[Warby Parker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socialenterprise.us/|title=Social Enterprise Alliance|last=|first=|date=|website=Social Enterprise Alliance|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liz Powers had worked within nonprofit organizations for eight years before creating ArtLifting and believed that the amount of time non-profit organizations typically spend on fundraising would be stifling given the impact she wanted to make and believed that being a for-profit social enterprise would enable ArtLifting to focus on sustainably growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artlifting.com/blogs/uplifting/73369475-from-a-shelter-worker-reflections-on-doing-good-and-earning-profit|title=ArtLifting - Buy Art, Change a Life.|website=www.artlifting.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with any for-profit [[art broker]], proceeds are split between artists and ArtLifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artbusiness.com/dealer.html|title=Art Dealers and Gallery Owners|website=www.artbusiness.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every artist earns 55% from the profit of each sale. 1% from each sale go toward strengthening art services for community partners that support ArtLifting artists, which includes art programming at social service agencies, [[Homeless shelter|shelter]]s, and disability centers. ArtLifting the invests the remaining 44% back into the company to further its mission.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artlifting.com/pages/frequently-asked-questions|title=ArtLifting - Buy Art, Change a Life.|website=www.artlifting.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===“Job Lifting”===

ArtLifting is part of a larger movement that its staff calls “JobLifting”--the concept of uplifting individuals who are experiencing difficult circumstances through creation of jobs and other opportunities, rather than centering business models on providing “handouts.”

===Recruiting Artists===
ArtLifting works with individuals who participate in shelter or disability center art programs across the U.S.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are thousands of existing art groups in shelters and disability centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nhchc.org/resources/clinical/tools-and-support/children-youth/|title=Children, Youth &amp; Families|last=|first=|date=2011-10-28|work=National Health Care for the Homeless Council|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first point of contact is most often the art director who oversees the artists in these programs. ArtLifting's [[Curator|curation]] team reviews all artwork to determine appropriate fit for ArtLifting’s platform and various sales channels including sales of originals, prints, products, and corporate opportunities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 
== Artists ==
'''Scott Benner''' struggled to find work after the company he worked for closed in 2009. Several years later Benner was diagnosed with Horner’s syndrome, making it nearly impossible for him to get and keep a job. Benner eventually lost his house in 2013 and became homeless. Benner had created intricate black and white ink drawings his whole life, but had never thought of selling them before his partnership with ArtLifting. Each individual piece can take up to 1,000 hours of work.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walsh|first1=Colleen|title=Art For Artists' Sake|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/09/art-for-artists-sake/|website=Harvard Gazette|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allen Chamberland''' has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which prevented him from finishing his degree in social work. The disease makes it nearly impossible for Chamberland to obtain a traditional job since he “can’t walk 10 or 15 feet without getting out of breath.” Chamberland uses an exacto knife and black pieces of paper to create his intricate papercut masterpieces. Chamberland said, “I still wake up surprised some mornings that this is actually working… People like my work … And without the encouragement and opportunity provided by ArtLifting, I never would have found this out.”&lt;ref name="gazette article"/&gt;

'''David McCauley''' injured his spinal cord in a diving accident in 2008. McCauley is an artist himself and is the founder of Rise Up Gallery, “a nonprofit organization that provides free art therapy workshops to the community and a venue in which emerging artists can exhibit their work.” McCauley partnered with ArtLifting to allow him to allocate more time to the creation of various types of artwork.&lt;ref name="Miami Herald McCauley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halper|first1=Marsha|title=Transforming the lives of disabled artists|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/living/health-fitness/article5149482.html|website=Miami Herald|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Art Attack''''' is a British [[children's television series]] revolving around [[art]], currently hosted by [[Lloyd Warbey]] on [[Disney Junior]], and originally airing on [[CITV]] hosted by [[Neil Buchanan]] from 1990 to 2007.

The original series aired on [[CITV]] between 15 June 1990 and 26 May 2007, and was presented by one of its creators, [[Neil Buchanan]], throughout. Buchanan also wrote and produced the series, and came up with a majority of the creative ideas. 

A new series launched on [[Disney Junior (UK &amp; Ireland)]] on 6 June 2011 and was presented by [[Jassa Ahluwalia]]. Each show involved Ahluwalia voicing-over footage of an artist producing three works of art, taking the viewer through the various stages of production step by step. Ahluwalia was later replaced with Lloyd Warbey at the start of the British second revived series.

==History==
The programme was originally a [[Television South|TVS]] production, devised by two TVS employees, Neil Buchanan and Tim Edmunds. Buchanan and Edmunds met each other at Southern Television in 1978, and worked together on ''[[No. 73]]'' and ''Do It!''.

The first Art Attacks were a strand within No. 73, and this segment proved so popular, [[Nigel Pickard]] the executive producer of children's programming at TVS green lit the pilot. The Art Attack [[television pilot|pilot]] was shot on location at a disused swimming pool in [[Gillingham, Kent]] in 1989, and the series began the following year.

When TVS lost its [[Media franchise|franchise]], Edmunds and Buchanan bought the rights to the show and produced ''Art Attack'' through their company, [[The Media Merchants]]. The Media Merchants used [[STV Productions]] (then known as "SMG Productions"), as the ITV company to get the series onto the network: this was partly down to the fact that Nigel Pickard had moved to [[Scottish Television]]. In 1993 another ex-TVS employee, Peter Urie set up a production management company, Television Support Services. Television Support Services managed all of the Media Merchants productions.

For the vast majority of its run, the show was filmed at [[The Maidstone Studios]], [[Maidstone, Kent]]. In 1998, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] bought the rights to produce foreign-language versions of Art Attack. Each version had a different local host for each territory, and was made in Maidstone, on a similar set to the original version. Neil Buchanan's Big Art Attacks were retained in the international shows, as was The Head, who was dubbed by relevant local voice artists. Buchanan also produced the artwork for the foreign versions - footage of his hands creating the pieces would be voiced over by the local host, who would show the artwork in-between stages and explain what to do next.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent-business/county-news/neils-hands-are-a-media-export-a2898/|title=Neil's hands are a media export|last=|first=|date=2002-03-28|website=Kent Business|publisher=KM Group|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney ended production of the foreign shows in 2005.

ITV announced the cancellation of the series in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= ''Art Attack'' axed after 18 years |url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/programming/a65632/art-attack-axed-after-18-years.html |last=Oatts |first=Joanne |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date= 13 July 2007 |accessdate=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until January 2014, the show was regularly repeated on [[CITV]], usually on weekend afternoons. After the programme's demise, many of the production team transferred to ''[[Finger Tips]]'' and ''[[Mister Maker]]'', both recorded at The Maidstone Studios.

In 2010, Disney announced a new version of the series would air on [[Disney Junior]] around the world. Production was moved to Disney's studios in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. Once again, several versions were made for each market; these were produced in a similar manner to the previous international versions. The first series of the new UK version was presented by [[Jassa Ahluwalia]]. Local artist Alexiev Gandman was brought in to create the Big Art Attacks.

In December 2012, Buchanan was featured in a segment dedicated to the programme's original run in the one-off documentary special ''30 Years of CITV'': a 1992 episode was broadcast on the CITV channel shortly after the above was broadcast, as part of its Old Skool Weekend marathon.

==Characters==

===The Head===
'''The Head''', was a puppet stone bust who would humorously recap the steps needed to produce the last art piece made. After doing this, he would usually show his creation of the previous Art Attack, most times however getting it hilariously wrong and usually bursting into tears. However, on occasion, by accidentally doing part of the instructions incorrectly, he would create a different effect to that desired and be proud of his work. He would sometimes tell jokes after the Big Art Attacks. In series one, 'The Head' was played by [[Jim Sweeney (comedian)|Jim Sweeney]], in series 2, [[Andrew O'Connor (actor)|Andrew O'Connor]]; and from series 3, having been redesigned as a puppet, he was voiced and operated by [[Francis Wright (puppeteer)|Francis Wright]]. 'The Head' did not appear in series 12 or 13, or in series 18 and 19.

===Vincent Van Coconut===
In the revived series, The Head was replaced by a talking [[palm tree]] called '''Vincent Van Coconut''', voiced by Tim Hibber. His name, Vincent van Coconut, is a parody of the famous Painter painter [[Vincent Van Gogh]].

Art competitions formed part of the modern [[Olympic Games]] during its early years, from 1912 to 1948.  The competitions were part of the original intention of the Olympic Movement's founder, [[Pierre de Coubertin|Pierre de Frédy, Baron de Coubertin]].  Medals were awarded for works of art inspired by [[sport]], divided into five categories: [[architecture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]].

The [[Juried (competition)|juried]] art competitions were abandoned in 1954 because artists were considered to be professionals, while Olympic athletes were required to be amateurs. Since 1956, the [[Cultural Olympiad|Olympic cultural programme]] has taken their place.

==History==
With the founding of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in 1894, and the celebration of the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games]], French Baron Pierre de Coubertin saw the fulfillment of his ideals—men being educated in both mind and body, and competing in sport rather than war. One of his other desires was to combine both art and sport, and he thus considered including artistic competition in the Olympic Games.

In May 1906, Baron de Coubertin organised a meeting in [[Paris]] for both IOC members and representatives of artists' organisations. The meeting ended with a proposal to the IOC to organise artistic competitions at the Olympic Games in five areas (architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture). The works of art entered had to be inspired by sports.

Preparations were underway to hold such competitions at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]], which were scheduled for [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. But the Italian organisers were faced with financial troubles and were forced to halt preparations, and the IOC awarded the organisation to [[London]] in 1907. The British organisers planned to hold the art competitions, but because of the short preparation time, they were cancelled. The organisers felt that artists would not have enough time to send in their works.

Pierre de Coubertin was not discouraged, and sought to include the artistic events in the programme of the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], to be held in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. Although the Swedes initially objected, opposing the idea of art combined with competition, they eventually gave in. The number of entrants was rather disappointing: only 35 artists are known to have sent works of art to Sweden, but gold medals were awarded in all five categories.

When the first [[1920 Summer Olympics|post-war Olympic Games]] were held in war-ravaged [[Belgium]], art contests were again on the programme, although they were little more than a sideshow. This was different for the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]]. The contests were taken seriously for the first time, and 193 artists submitted works. This figure included three [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] artists, even though the Soviet Union officially did not take part in the Olympic Games, which they considered to be a "bourgeois" festival.

The growth continued at the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Amsterdam Olympics]], where over 1,100 works of art were exhibited in the [[Stedelijk Museum|Municipal Museum]], not including the submissions in literature, music and architecture. Artists were allowed to sell their works at the close of the exhibition, which was rather controversial given the IOC's amateurism policy, which required all competitors to be amateurs. In Amsterdam, the number of events was also increased, as four of the five fields of art were subdivided, creating more events.

Because of the economy and the remote location of [[Los Angeles]], participation in the athletic events of the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Games]] was lower than that of 1928. The art competition did not suffer from this problem, and the number of art works entered remained stable. Their exhibition drew 384,000 visitors to the [[Los Angeles Museum of History, Science and Art]]. Art contests were also held in [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin (1936)]] and [[1948 Summer Olympics|London (1948)]], with reasonable success, although the number of entered works had significantly dropped by 1948.

In 1949, a report was presented at the IOC meeting in Rome which concluded that practically all contestants in the art competitions were professionals, and that the competitions should therefore be abolished and replaced with an exhibition without awards or medals. This sparked a heated debate within the IOC. At a 1951 meeting, the IOC decided to reinstate the competitions for the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]]. However, the [[Finland|Finnish]] organisers claimed there was insufficient time, and an art competition was not held. An art exhibition took place in its stead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1952/OR1952.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411091045/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1952/OR1952.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue continued to be debated within the Olympic Movement, and at the 49th IOC Session in Athens, 1954, the IOC members voted to replace the art contests with an exhibition for future Olympics. Several attempts have been made to re-include them, but without success.

The Olympics continue to be connected with art exhibitions, however. The [[Olympic Charter]] required organisers of the Olympic Games to include a programme of cultural events, to "serve to promote harmonious relations, mutual understanding and friendship among the participants and others attending the Olympic Games".

==Competition==
From 1912 to 1948 rules of the art competition varied, but the core of the rules remained the same. All of the entered works had to be inspired by sport, and had to be original (that is, not be published before the competition). Like in the athletic events at the Olympics, gold, silver, and bronze medals were awarded to the highest ranked artists, although not all medals were awarded in each competition. On a few occasions, in fact, no medals were presented at all.

Generally, it was permitted for artists to enter multiple works, although a maximum number was sometimes established. This made it possible for an artist to win multiple prizes in a single competition.

At one time or another, there were suggestions to also include [[dancing]], [[film]], [[photography]], or [[theatre]], but none of these art forms was ever included in the Olympic Games as a medal event.

===Architecture===
[[Image:Amsterdam Olympisch Stadion.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The 1928 Olympic Stadium, designed by Jan Wils, won the gold medal in architecture at the 1928 Olympics.]]

Until the Amsterdam Games in 1928, the architectural competition was not divided into categories. The 1928 games introduced a town planning category. However, the division was not always clear, and some designs were awarded prizes in both categories.

Entries in this category were allowed to have been "published" before the Olympics. A notable example of this is the 1928 gold medal for architecture awarded to [[Jan Wils]] for his design of the Olympic Stadium used in the same Olympics.

===Literature===
The literature competitions were divided into a varied number of categories. Until 1924 and again in 1932, there was only a single literature category. In 1928, separate categories were introduced for [[drama]]tic, [[Epic poetry|epic]], and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] literature. Awards in these categories were also presented in 1948, while the drama category was dropped in 1936.

Entered works were limited in length (20,000 words) and could be submitted in any language, provided they were accompanied by [[English language|English]] and/or [[French language|French]] translations or summaries (rules varied over the years).

===Music===
A single event for music was held until 1936, when three categories were introduced: one for [[orchestral]] music, one for [[instrumental]] music, and one for both [[solo (music)|solo]] and [[choir|choral]] music. In 1948, these categories were slightly modified into choral/orchestral, instrumental/[[chamber music|chamber]], and [[vocal music]].

The juries often had trouble judging the pieces, which were entered on paper. Possibly related to the problematic judging, juries frequently decided to award only a few prizes. On two occasions, no award was given out at all (in the 1924 music category and in the 1936 instrumental music category).

1936 marked the only occasion when the winning musical works were actually played before an audience.

[[Josef Suk (composer)|Josef Suk]] is the only well-known musician to have competed, winning a silver medal in 1932.

===Painting===
[[Image:Rugby by Jean Jacoby.png|thumb|200px|right|Jean Jacoby is the only artist to win two gold medals. He won his second with the above drawing, titled ''Rugby''.]]

As with the other art forms, a single painting category was on the program until 1928, when it was split out into three sub-categories: [[drawing]]s, [[graphic art]]s, and paintings. The categories then changed at each of the following Olympic Games. In 1932, the three categories were: paintings, [[printmaking|prints]], and [[watercolor]]s/drawings. Four years later, the prints category had disappeared, and had been replaced by graphic arts and commercial graphic art. At the final Olympic art competition, the three categories were applied arts and crafts, [[engraving]]s/[[etching]]s, and oils/water colours.

===Sculpture===
The sculpture class had only a single category until 1928, when two separate competitions were designated; one for [[statue]]s and one for [[relief]]s and [[medal]]s. In 1936, this was split up further, separating reliefs and medals into their own categories.

==Competitors==
While several of the Olympic art medallists have achieved at least national fame, few of them can be considered well-known artists globally. In fact, the 1924 Games featured better known jury members than artists, with artists like [[Selma Lagerlöf]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]] judging the entered works.

Judging by the medals won, [[Luxembourg]] painter [[Jean Jacoby]] is the most successful Olympic artist, winning the gold medal for his 1924 painting ''Étude de Sport'', and for his drawing ''Rugby'' in 1928. [[Switzerland|Swiss]] artist [[Alex Diggelmann]] won three medals, a gold one in 1936 (for his poster ''Arosa I Placard''), and a silver and a bronze in the 1948 applied arts &amp; crafts class, both with commercial posters. [[Denmark|Danish]] writer [[Josef Petersen]] won a silver medal on three occasions: in 1924, 1932, and 1948.

[[Image:Hajos.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Alfréd Hajós is one of only two Olympians to have won medals in both sport and art competitions]]

Only two persons have won Olympic medals in both sport and art competitions. [[Walter W. Winans]], an [[United States|American]] who lived in England, won a gold medal as a [[shooting|marksman]] at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in the running deer (double shot) competition. In 1912, he won another shooting medal—silver this time—in the running deer team competition. By then, he had already won a gold medal for his sculpture ''An American trotter''. The other Olympian with successes in both fields is [[Alfréd Hajós]] of [[Hungary]]. As a [[swimming (sport)|swimmer]], he won two gold medals at the [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Athens Olympics]]. Twenty-eight years later, he was awarded a silver medal in architecture for his stadium design, co-designed with [[Dezső Lauber]].

Two presidents of the International Olympic Committee have also been among the entrants in the Olympic art competitions. In 1912 [[Pierre de Coubertin]], under the [[pseudonym]] "Georges Hohrod and Martin Eschbach", entered ''Ode to sport'', which won the gold medal. [[Avery Brundage]], who competed as an athlete at the 1912 Games, entered literary works at the 1932 and 1936 Olympics, earning an honorary mention in 1932. He would serve as the IOC's president from 1952 to 1971.

Britain's [[John Copley (artist)|John Copley]], winner of a silver medal in the 1948 engravings and etchings competition, was 73 years of age, making him the oldest Olympic medallist in history. The oldest Olympic medallist outside the art competitions is [[Sweden|Swedish]] shooter [[Oscar Swahn]], who won his last medal at age 72.

[[Image:Battagliadicascina.jpg|thumb|300px|Copy of the ''Battle'' by Michelangelo's pupil [[Bastiano da Sangallo|Aristotele da Sangallo]]]]
The '''''Battle of Cascina''''' is a lost artwork by [[Michelangelo]].

==Origins==
The painting was commissioned from Michelangelo by [[Piero Soderini]], [[politician|statesman]] of the Democratic of Florence. It was intended to wall of the ''Salone dei Cinquecento'' in [[Palazzo Vecchio]]. The opposite wall was to be decorated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who was commissioned to depict the [[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]. The two battles were notable medieval Florentine victories. The [[Battle of Cascina]] was fought on 28 July 1364 between the troops of Florence and [[Pisa]], resulting in victory of the former. A thousand Pisans were killed and two hundred more were captured.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Description==
Michelangelo never completed the painting, but did produce a complete [[cartoon#Fine art|cartoon]] of the composition. The cartoon was copied by several artists, the most notable extant copy being by Michelangelo's pupil Sangallo. Some of Michelangelo's preparatory drawings also survive, along with prints of part of the scene by [[Marcantonio Raimondi]]. According to Michelangelo's biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] the original cartoon was deliberately destroyed by Michelangelo's rival [[Bartolommeo Bandinelli]] because of his jealousy of its fame.

Michelangelo depicted a scene at the beginning of the battle when the Florentine army was initially taken by surprise when the Pisans attacked. He depicts Florentine soldiers bathing naked in the river [[Arno]] responding to a trumpet which warns them of the sudden Pisan attack. As the soldiers emerge from the river and buckle on their armour, they are threatened by shots from the Pisans. Several soldiers look or point towards the Pisan position to the left. One soldier has apparently been hit and fallen back into the river, while others leap energetically into action.

The chosen episode allowed Michelangelo to depict his favoured topic: the naked male figure in varieties of [[contrapposto]].

The '''Birds Mosaic''' is a mosaic floor that was discovered in [[Caesarea]], [[Israel]].

==Discovery==
[[File:Caesarea-Maritima-2-234.jpg|200px|thumb|right|General view of the mosaic. In the middle are cisterns.]]
The mosaic was discovered in 1950 during a military exercise, and after five years was covered in sand to prevent deterioration. Archaeologist [[Shmuel Yeivin]] was the first to publish about it, and described it as a church due to the apse located in the east of the building. Since no pillars were found, he proposed that the church was without a roof. But in 1985 archaeologist [[Ronny Reich]] concluded that the site was the central part of a villa, rather than a church.

In 2004, the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] removed the 70 cm thick dirt layer covering the mosaic, restored and strengthened it, and prepared it for visitors. The site was opened to the public in October 2005. Entrance to the site is free, and it is possible to walk on the mosaic.

==The site==

The mosaic floor belongs to a [[Byzantine]] palace that was built in the end of the 6th century or beginning of the 7th century, and which lay outside the walls of [[Caesarea Maritima|ancient Caesarea]]. The floor covered the central courtyard of the palace, which was led to by a portico on the west side. Surrounding it was a colonnade, rooms, and additional courtyards with mosaic floors. The built area of the palace was about 1500 square meters, and the entire settlement covered about 3 [[dunam]]s. It belonged to a wealthy Christian family, but no indications of its identity have been found. The building had an additional story which also had mosaic floors, parts of which collapsed when the palace was destroyed by fire, apparently during the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] in 640. The wooden beams of the second floor were burned, and parts of its mosaic were found on the floor of the first story.
===The mosaic===
The mosaic takes up an area of 16 by 14.5 meters. It includes a frame decorated with fruit trees bearing large and beautiful fruit. Between the trees are large mammals in states of movement. The mammals include lions, leopards, bears, ibex, dogs, elephants, gazelle, oxen, wild boar, horse, and goat.

The center of the mosaic (surrounded by the frame) consists of 120 round medallions populated by large colorful birds, which give the mosaic its name. The medallions form 12 rows, with different kinds of birds in each row - [[peacocks]], [[storks]], [[pelicans]], [[herons]], [[pheasants]], grey-headed [[swamphen]], [[duck]], [[flamingo]], [[guineafowl]], [[ostrich]], [[rock partridge]] - all of them facing to the left. The sequence of birds is such that the same species is repeated along a diagonal in the medallion array.

Under the mosaic is a plastered cistern, to which drained rainwater from the entire complex. In the northwest corner of the site was a reservoir which received its water from a well. The complex was too high to receive water from Caesarea's aqueduct, so it needed an independent water supply.

===Table===
Another, unique, finding at the site was a table cover in the shape of the letter D, tiled with squares and triangles. The table was made with the "glass-gold" method - two layers of glass with a gold layer between it, and figures of crosses and flowers in the gold layer. When the palace was burned, the table overturned and was burned, while the cover was preserved on the floor. This cover was removed from the site for preservation.

'''''Bishop Petros with Saint Peter the Apostle''''' ({{Lang-pl|Biskup Petros ze świętym Piotrem Apostołem}}) is a [[Nubia]]n Christian wall painting from the last quarter of the 10th century.{{Sfn|Mierzejewska|2016|loc="Opis"}}{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} Made with [[tempera]] on [[silt]] [[plaster]] using a [[Fresco-secco|''al secco'']] [[fresco]] technique, it depicts Petros, the bishop of [[Faras]] between 974 and 997. The anonymous work was discovered in the ruins of [[Faras Cathedral]], an important religious centre of Nubia, in modern [[Sudan]]. Rescued from flooding when [[Lake Nasser]] was created, since 1964 it is part of the Faras Gallery of the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum in Warsaw]].{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}}

The painting, which used to be part of a larger composition, representing King [[Georgios II of Makuria]] with the [[Virgin and Child]], was painted on the west wall of the chapel located in the southern [[nave]] of the cathedral.  The portrait of the bishop was placed to the right of the image of the king. The representation of the two highest hierarchs of the state along with their [[patron saints]] indicated the supernatural origin of the power of the nobles and symbolized the unity of the clerical and secular power.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|p=182}}

The image was created in Petros' lifetime, which is suggested by the inscription in Greek accompanying the painting, wishing him "many years [of life]".{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} The painting is considered one of the most precious images of Nubian officials found in the Cathedral of Faras{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} and is also one of six best preserved portraits of bishops discovered there.{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|p=176}}

== History ==
The painting, like most other pieces of {{Interlanguage link multi|Christian Nubian art|pl|3=Chrześcijańskie malarstwo nubijskie|lt=Nubian art}} in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Faras Gallery|pl|3=Galeria Faras im. Profesora Kazimierza Michałowskiego w Muzeum Narodowym w Warszawie}} of the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum in Warsaw]], was recovered by Polish archaeologists during the so-called Nubian Campaign, an international effort led by [[UNESCO]] prior to construction of the [[Lake Nasser|Nasser Dam]]. The excavations, carried out between 1961 and 1964, discovered a religious complex in the town of Faras (ancient Pachoras), near modern Sudanese-Egyptian border. Well-preserved ruins of a large Christian cathedral from 7th to 14th centuries contained well-preserved wall religious paintings.{{Sfn|Sulikowska|2015|loc=¶ 1–12}}

Since the area was to be flooded by the waters of the artificial Lake Nasser, a team of Polish archaeologists led by [[Kazimierz Michałowski]] was allowed to recover the artifacts. A major part was then transported to the [[National Museum of Sudan]], where a team of Polish scientists led by [[Józef Gazy]] carried out {{Interlanguage link multi|Conservation and restoration of Faras wall paintings|pl|3=Konserwacja i restauracja malowideł ściennych z Faras|lt=their conservation}}. Some 40 per cent were transported to the National Museum of Warsaw, becoming the nucleus of the future Faras Gallery.{{Sfn|Sulikowska|2015|loc=¶ 1–12}}

The image itself was painted by an anonymous artist some time during bishop Petros' tenure, between 974 and 999 AD.{{Sfn|Michałowski|1974}} It represents the so-called yellow and red style, typical of a transitional period between the white style of 9th century and later multicolour style introduced in the 11th century and typical of all later wall paintings at Faras until its abandonment in the 14th century. Other images representative of the yellow and red style found at Faras represent King Georgios, a ''Virgin and Child'', ''Three Men in the Fiery Furnace'', as well as a Passion Cycle. The red and yellow style paintings are considered among the most interesting, both visually and for their theological message.{{Sfn|Michałowski|1974}}

== Description ==
[[File:Faras_-_Restoration_in_MNW-04.jpg|thumb|Work on conservation and restoration of the fresco in Warsaw's National Museum, 1964–1966]]

The dark-skinned bishop is depicted wearing his liturgical robes, complete with a narrow, white handkerchief (''[[encheiron]]'') wound around the index finger of his right palm. With it he points at a [[Gospel Book]] he holds in his other arm.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}}

Petros is dressed in a long white robe (''[[sticharion]]'') with vertical green stripes. His yellow ''[[phelonion]]'' (a type of [[chasuble]]), in the shape of an elongated ellipse, is adorned with a pattern of a red net, with precious stones sewn into the fabric. The edge of the chasuble is also adorned with a strip of fabric with green and red jewels. Bishop's ''[[epitrachelion]]'' is decorated with yellow wheels with a green circuit and red rectangles.{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|p=178}} The ''[[omophorion]]'', one of symbols of episcopal dignity, is white with a pattern of circles and rectangles.{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|pp=181–182}} The head of the bishop is wrapped in a turban characteristic of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] hierarchs, which could suggest that Petros was a [[Monophysitism|monophysite]].{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|pp=186–188}}

Behind the bishop stands Saint [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]], dressed in a white crown signifying martyrdom. The saint has both hands on the shoulders of the bishop.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} This pose, common in Nubian painting of the epoch, signifies the fact that the saint protects and supports the bishop,{{sfn|Martens-Czarnecka|2006|p=35}} but also points at the supernatural character of bishop's power.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}}

Around the head of Saint Peter there is a black inscription in Greek: SAINT PETER THE APOSTLE MARTYR OF THE CROSS ABBA PETROS BISHOP AND METROPOLITAN OF PACHORAS [may he live] MANY YEARS.{{Sfn|Mierzejewska|2016|loc="Opis"}}

The '''wild boar''' and '''boar's head''' are common [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] in [[heraldry]].

==Early history==
The boar was used as an emblem in some instances during antiquity and the [[Early Middle Ages]] (i.e. predating the development of classical European [[heraldry]]). During the [[Roman Empire]], at least three [[Roman Legion|legions]] are known to have had a boar as their emblems - [[Legio I Italica]], [[Legio X Fretensis]] and [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix]].
The Knocknagael Boar Stone is a well-known [[Pictish stones|Pictish stone]] with a depiction of a boar emblem dating to ca. the 7th century. In this context, the name of [[Orkney]] is interpreted as being derived from ''orc-'', the Celtic for "pig", presumably from a Pictish tribe which had the boar or wild pig as their emblem. The boar also appears to have been used as an emblem during the [[Viking Age]], reflected in the mythological boar [[Gullinbursti]], a representation of the god [[Freyr]], and in [[Hildisvíni]] ("battle pig"), the boar of the goddess [[Freya]], and also mentioned in ''[[Beowulf]]'' as a figure of a boar worn in battle on the crest of a helmet.

With the development of [[heraldry]]  in the [[Late Middle Ages]],  the boar makes an appearance as the  [[White Boar]], [[personal device]] of [[Richard III of England]], used for large numbers of his [[livery badge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2007-06-21
|quote=In Europe the boar is one of the four heraldic beasts of the chase and was the distinguishing mark of Richard III, king of England.
}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, a coat of arms of "Tribalia", depicting a wild boar with an arrow pierced through the head (see Boars in heraldry), appeared in the supposed Coat of Arms of Emperor [[Stefan Dušan]] (r. 1331–1355). The motif had, in 1415, been used as the Coat of Arms of the [[Serbian Despotate]] and is recalled in one of [[Stefan Lazarević]]'s personal Seals, according to the paper Сабор у Констанци. [[Pavao Ritter Vitezović]] also depicts "Triballia" with the same motif in 1701 and 
[[Hristofor Žefarović]] again in 1741. With the beginning of the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804-1813), the Parliament adopted the [[Coat of arms of Serbia]] in 1805. Their official seal depicted the heraldic emblems of Serbia and Tribalia. 

The [[Buzic]] noble family of [[Bohemia]] used a boar's head as heraldic device from the 14th century, later (as [[Zajíc]]) combined with a hare.

==Early Modern and modern examples==
In heraldry of the [[early modern period]], use of a boar's head (rather than the entire animal) became a popular device.
[[Siebmachers Wappenbuch]] (1605) shows a boar in the coat of arms of the [[Schweinichen]] noble family.

Modern rulers who have used the boar's head as part of their coats of arms include [[Joseph Bonaparte]], [[Joachim Murat]]

===Family coats of arms===
In Ireland, boars feature in many coats of arms of the noble families, Three boars are seen on coats of arms of [[Clan Lockhart|Lockhart]], [[Grimsby]], [[Clan Healy|Healy]], and [[James Edward Oglethorpe]]. In addition, the [[Sullivan (surname)|Sullivan]]-Mor coat of arms bears a boar, and the Sullivan-Ber crest has two. The O'Deorain ([[Doran (surname)|Doran]]) clan, being an offshoot of the Sullivans, has a boar upon its crest, as well.  The Rogan coat of arms features a boar crossing a hilltop. The Healy clan, has three boars' heads. The Purcell clan's coat of arms features four black boars' heads. The McCann coat of arms features a boar as well. The [[Crowley (surname)|Crowley]] coat of arms features a blue boar surrounded by three red crosses. The [[Cassidy (surname)|Cassidy]] coat of arms features a white boar in a red triangular field under two red lions.

In Scotland, a boar's head is the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] of [[Clan Campbell]] and [[Clan Innes]]. It appears in both the coat of arms and crest of [[Clan Chisholm]].  Three boars' heads appear in the coats of arms of the related clans [[Clan Swinton|Swinton]], [[Clan Gordon|Gordon]], [[Clan Nesbitt|Nesbitt]] and [[Clan Urquhart|Urquhart]].  Three boars' heads are also used by the unrelated Bannerman clan.The [[Keating (surname)|Keating]] clan uses a boar going through a holly bush to symbolize toughness and courage.

In Spain, the coats of arms of the noble families [[Garmendia]], Urraga, Urrutia, Urieta and Urmeneta have a boar.  Boars, wolves and bears are common charges in [[Basque people|Basque]] armory, especially from [[Guipuzcoa]].

===Towns===
[[File:Coat of arms of Malacky.png|thumb|250px|Coat of arms of [[Malacky]] in [[Slovakia]].]]

Boar charges are also often used in [[canting arms|canting]] (heraldic [[pun]]ning). The [[Germany|German]] towns of [[Eberbach (Baden)|Eberbach]]  and [[Ebersbach an der Fils]], both in [[Baden-Württemberg]], and [[Ebersbach, Saxony]] use civic arms that demonstrates this. Each depicts a boar  - ''{{lang|de|Eber}}'' in [[German language|German]] (and in two cases a wavy [[fess]] or [[bar (heraldry)|bars]] meant to represent a [[stream|brook]] - ''{{lang|de|Bach}}'' in German).

[[Albano Laziale]] in [[Italy]] is near the site where, according to legend, [[Aeneas]]'s son [[Ascanius]] founded [[Alba Longa]]; the modern city's coat of arms today sports the white (Latin: ''Alba'') boar dreamt by Ascanius before the founding of the city.{{Dubious|date=August 2011}}
[[Malacky]] in [[Slovakia]] also has a coat of arms with a [[wild boar]].The name of the city, which was first mentioned in writing in 1206, refers to the word "Malacka" which means "piglet" in the Hungarian ([[Hungarian language|Magyar]]) language.

===Military and paramilitary badges===
In various armorials, the Serbian coat of arms has featured the pierced head of a wild boar, also known as the [[coat of arms of Triballia]]. The war flag of the [[Serbian revolution]]ary forces during the [[First Serbian Uprising]] featured it together with the [[Serbian cross]].  

In [[Belgium]], the wild boar is the symbolic animal of the [[Ardennes]] forests in the south of the country, and is the mascot of one of the [[Belgian Army]]'s premier infantry regiments, the [[Regiment of Ardennian Rifles|Régiment de Chasseurs Ardennais]], the soldiers of which wear a boar's head pin on their [[beret]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

'''''Coming South''''' is a [[1886 in art|1886]] painting by the Australian artist [[Tom Roberts]]. The painting depicts migrants coming to Australia from Europe aboard a steamship. Roberts based the painting on sketches he had made when returning to Australia aboard the ''SS Lusitania'' in 1885 after four years abroad in Europe.&lt;ref name="Migration"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/collection/stories/identity/cultural-and-personal-identity/migration-and-multiculturalism | title=Migration and multiculturalism | publisher=National Gallery of Victoria | work=Collection Stories | accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Humphrey McQueen]] describes ''Coming South'' as one of Roberts' seven best-known paintings.&lt;ref name="McQueen"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://home.alphalink.com.au/~loge27/roberts/roberts_roberts_review.htm | title=Review: Tom Roberts | accessdate=11 May 2012 | author=Seeton, Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Gallery of Victoria]] describes it as "a definitive image of the migrant experience" and "Roberts's first exploration of one of the great themes of Australian life".&lt;ref name="NGV"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/work/2892 | title=Coming South | publisher=National Gallery of Victoria | work=Collection Online | accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was acquired by the National Gallery of Victoria in 1967.&lt;ref name="NGV" /&gt;

[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|right|360px|Expansion of U.S. copyright term (Assuming authors create their works at age 35 and live for 70 years)]]
'''Copyright term''' is the length of time [[copyright]] subsists in a work before it passes into the [[public domain]].

==Length of copyright==
Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. [[musical composition]] or [[novel]]), whether the work has been published or not, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. In most countries (for example, the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|305}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations |date=1995|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19953297_en_3.htm |title=Amendments of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;) copyright expires at the end of the calendar year in question.

The length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the copyright duration in a given country difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately six years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes [[Ex post facto law|retroactively]]). International treaties, like the [[Berne Convention]], establish minimum terms for copyrights, but these only apply to the signatory countries, and individual countries may grant longer terms than those set out in a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Copyright: Sacred Text, Technology, and the DMCA |last=Nimmer |first=David |publisher=Kluwer Law International |year=2003 |isbn=978-90-411-8876-2 |oclc=50606064 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RYfRCNxgPO4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
===Copyright term and the public domain===
The extension of copyright term, imposes tangible restrictions on the [[public domain]]. For instance, scholar Neil Netanel argued that [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] 1998 prevented the entering of works central to [[Culture of the United States|cultural heritage of the US]] into the public domain. He argued, culturally important dissemination, recasting, or incorporation into new expression is prevented due "to the copyright holder's veto". As examples he gave the adaption of the plot from novels such as [[The Great Gatsby]] and [[Peter Pan]], the refashion of characters like [[Mickey Mouse]], or the use of [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs like "[[Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love)]]" for documentaries about the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=nethanel&gt;{{Cite book| last = Netanel| first = Neil| title = Copyright’s paradox| publisher = Oxford University Press US| date = 2008| pages = 200| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=vo9G-0iZNQIC&amp;dq=orphan+works&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780195137620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright term and orphan works===
For the millions of older copyrighted works of less enduring popularity, it is difficult, or impossible, to trace the copyright ownership and determine who holds the particular rights that would have to be licensed for the use of the work. The problem of such [[orphan works]] stems from the extension of copyright term and the lack of requirement for the copyright owner to renew or [[Copyright registration|register their copyright]].&lt;ref name=nethanel/&gt; In order to tackle this perceived problem some jurisdictions have [[Copyright reform|revised their copyright laws]] to allow use of orphaned works, after diligent searches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/chapter/III/crossheading/orphan-works] Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988, s44B&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and discussion==
Discussions about the optimal length of the copyright term (e.g. regarding the copyrights incentive for creative production&lt;ref name="petra moser"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130214025845/http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/mdocs/en/wipo_ip_econ_ge_5_12/wipo_ip_econ_ge_5_12_ref_moser.pdf DEAD POETS’ PROPERTY - THE COPYRIGHT ACT OF 1814 AND THE PRICE OF LITERATURE IN THE ROMANTIC PERIOD] XING LI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY, MEGAN MACGARVIE, BOSTON UNIVERSITY AND NBER, AND PETRA MOSER, STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND NBER (NOVEMBER 14, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;) is a significant part of public and scientific discourse and reception.&lt;ref name="JASSS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/15868004 Copyright and wrong - Why the rules on copyright need to return to their roots] on [[The Economist]] ''"The notion that lengthening copyright increases creativity is questionable, however. Authors and artists do not generally consult the statute books before deciding whether or not to pick up pen or paintbrush. And overlong copyrights often limit, rather than encourage, a work's dissemination, impact and influence."'' (Apr 8th 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2012/09/do-patent-and-copyright-law-restrict-competition-and-creativity-excessively-posner.html Do patent and copyright law restrict competition and creativity excessively?] on [[University of Chicago Law School]] by Becker &amp; Posner ''"I am concerned that both patent and copyright protection, though particularly the former, may be excessive."''

If anything, patents inhibit innovation. |publisher=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earlier and often cited positions is from the British politician [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] who argued in an 1841 speech in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that copyright is a [[monopoly]] and as such has generally negative effects on society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~dkarjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/commentary/MacaulaySpeeches.html MacaulaySpeeches] on law.asu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepublicdomain.org/2014/07/24/macaulay-on-copyright/ macaulay-on-copyright] on thepublicdomain.org&lt;/ref&gt; Although Macaulay's speech is widely reported, the reaction to it in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] is hard to find – Ricketson reports that following Macaulay's claims that the heirs of certain authors would block publication of their works:

:"At this point, the debate in the House of Commons fell into farce because there were claims by other speakers that they had no doubts (based on their own personal knowledge) that Richardson and Boswell's descendants would still have done the right thing and allowed reprinting, however much they abhorred their ancestors' works!"&lt;ref&gt;Sam Ricketson, The copyright term, International Review of Intellectual Property and Competition Law (1992), 753, p767.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also worth noting that Macaulay is arguing here against term extension, he is not arguing against copyright. This point is well made by Macaulay himself:

:"The advantages arising from a system of copyright are obvious. It is desirable that we should have a supply of good books: we cannot have such a supply unless men of letters are liberally remunerated; and the least objectionable way of remunerating them is by means of copyright."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Babington Macaulay, Speeches of Lord Macaulay, Longman, Green, Longman and Roberts, 1860, p232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liebowitz describes use of the term monopoly in relation to copyright as misleading, but "rhetorically effective".&lt;ref&gt;Stan Liebowitz, A critique of copyright criticism, George Mason Law Review, vol 22:4:943 (2015), p958.&lt;/ref&gt; While Towse writes that a more appropriate term is '[[monopolistic competition]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Towse, Copyright, risk and the artist: an economic approach to policy for artists, International Journal of Cultural Policy, 6:1:91 (1999), p105, note 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a paper by [[Rufus Pollock]] of [[University of Cambridge]] scientifically quantified the optimal copyright term length at 15 years, significantly shorter than any currently existing copyright term, via an economical model with [[U-statistic|empirically-estimable parameter]]s.&lt;ref name="HoEoC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate=2013-02-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221124708/http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_over_time.pdf |url=http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |title=OPTIMAL COPYRIGHT OVER TIME: TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND THE STOCK OF WORKS |first=Rufus |last=Pollock |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |date=2007-10-01 |accessdate=2015-01-11 |authorlink=Rufus Pollock |quote=''The optimal level for copyright has been a matter for extensive debate over the last decade. Using a parsimonious theoretical model this paper contributes several new results of relevance to this debate. In particular we demonstrate that (a) optimal copyright is likely to fall as the production costs of `originals' decline (for example as a result of digitization) (b) technological change which reduces costs of production may imply a decrease or a decrease in optimal levels of protection (this contrasts with a large number of commentators, particularly in the copyright industries, who have argued that such change necessitates increases in protection) (c) the optimal level of copyright will, in general, fall over time as the stock of work increases.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate=2013-01-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112152530/http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |url=http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |title=FOREVER MINUS A DAY?

Based on a novel approach we derive an explicit formula which characterises the optimal term as a function of a few key and, most importantly, empirically-estimable parameters. Using existing data on recordings and books we obtain a point estimate of around 15 years for optimal copyright term with a 99% confidence interval extending up to 38 years. This is substantially shorter than any current copyright term and implies that existing terms are too long.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 scholar Petra Moser concluded in a paper on the impact of the copyright extension on the British [[Copyright Act 1814|Copyright Act of 1814]] that "longer copyrights raise the costs of accessing intellectual assets for consumers and other firms, which may discourage the diffusion of knowledge and decelerate the pace of cumulative innovation and [[Learning-by-doing (economics)|learning-by-doing]]."&lt;ref name="petra moser"/&gt;

In 2014 a [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] article about the existence of [[Orphaned works|orphaned]] classical [[video game]]s and the suggestion of letting them enter the public domain after 20 years, raised a controversial public debate about copyright terms and public domain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/29/gogs-time-machine-sale-lets-you-control-time-itself/ |title=GOG’s Time Machine Sale Lets You CONTROL TIME ITSELF |first=John |last=Walker |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2016-01-30 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |quote=''As someone who desperately pines for the PD model that drove creativity before the copyright industry malevolently took over the planet, it saddens my heart that a game two decades old isn’t released into the world.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/02/03/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain/ |title=Editorial: Why Games Should Enter The Public Domain |first=John |last=Walker |date=2014-02-03 |accessdate=2016-01-30 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |quote=''games more than a couple of decades old aren’t entering the public domain.

John Walker argues that perhaps a good cutoff would be 20 years before an "idea" enters the public domain."'' (February 03, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 2015 published [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]] paper, analysed with a simulated model the relationship of scientific knowledge creation to copyright term length and concluded a decreased knowledge production on copyright term increases for the analysed context.&lt;ref name="JASSS"&gt;[http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/18/2/23.html Does Longer Copyright Protection Help or Hurt Scientific Knowledge Creation?] [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]] 18 (2) 23 DOI: 10.18564/jasss.2720 ''"The prevailing trend in most simulations was that increasing the copyright term resulted decreased knowledge production."'' (31-Mar-2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a curiosity, the work ''[[Peter and Wendy#Copyright status|Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'' is subject in the UK to a special clause in the [[Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988]]&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 s301 and schedule 6.&lt;/ref&gt; that granted [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] a right to royalty in perpetuity. [[J M Barrie]] had gifted the copyright to the work to the hospital in 1929. The different copyright terms in the various jurisdictions has led to some disputes involving derivative works created and/or sold elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/cases/emily_somma_v_gosh_peter_.shtml  |title=Stanford Center for Internet and Society |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2010-05-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061027134508/http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/cases/emily_somma_v_gosh_peter_.shtml |archivedate = 2006-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dominic Serres''' [[Royal Academy|RA]] (1722–1793), also known as Dominic Serres the Elder, was a [[France|French]]-born [[Painting|painter]] strongly associated with the [[English school of painting]], and with paintings with a naval or marine theme. Such were his connections with the English art world, that he became one of the founding members of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1768, and was later briefly (from 1792 until his death) its librarian.

Born in [[Auch]], [[Gascony]], he was initially expected to train as a priest but instead travelled to [[Spain]] and became a ship’s captain, sailing to [[Cuba]]. He was taken prisoner by the British navy towards the end of the 1740s and eventually settled in [[London]] in about 1758, where it is believed he trained as a painter in [[Northamptonshire]] and later in [[London]] under [[Charles Brooking]]. If Serres did not settle in London until 1758, however, he could not have studied for long under Charles Brooking, since Brooking was buried on 25 March 1759.

Reflecting his early career, many of his paintings have naval themes. Working for a publisher documenting the events in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763), he painted a series of depictions including the capture of [[Havana]] (1762). He also painted events in the [[United States|America]]n [[American War of Independence|War of Independence]] (1776–1783). In 1780, he was appointed Marine Painter to King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].

Serres died in 1793, and was buried at St. [[St Marylebone Parish Church|Marylebone]] Old Church. His eldest son [[John Thomas Serres]] (1759–1825) also became a prolific marine artist.

'''''Émail en résille sur verre''''' ("enamel in a network on glass") is a rare and difficult [[vitreous enamel|enameling]] technique first practiced for a brief period in seventeenth-century [[France]].&lt;ref name="Evans1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan Evans|title=A History of Jewellery 1100-1870|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgUJmQYEm9wC|accessdate=31 March 2013|year=1970|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-26122-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revived by [[United States|American]] [[metalsmith]] [[Margret Craver]], who encountered the technique in 1953 and spent 13 years re-creating and perfecting it.&lt;ref name="Craft: Jewelry: Brooch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanart.si.edu/luce/object.cfm?key=338&amp;artistmedia=0&amp;subkey=330 |title=Craft: Jewelry: Brooch |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work=Luce Foundation Center for American Art |publisher=Smithsonian American Art Museum |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
The technique involves etching a design in a piece of glass, which is then lined with gold foil and the hollow filled with powdered enamel.&lt;ref name="Evans1970"/&gt; It is difficult to accomplish in part because of the extremely careful regulation of temperature required to fuse the enamel without damaging the glass in which it is embedded.&lt;ref name="Museum Studies"&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Studies|year=1999|publisher=Art Institute of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edges of the foil form a frame for the enamel, giving the appearance, as artist [[William Claude Harper]] described it, of "the most delicate cloisonné that you can imagine".&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-william-harper-12112 |title=Oral history interview with William Harper, 2004 Jan. 12-13 |date=January 12–13, 2004 |work=Archives of American Art Research Collections |publisher=Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950s rediscovery==
In 1953, metalsmith [[Margret Craver]] saw a pin decorated using the technique.&lt;ref name="Schon"/&gt;  Craver began studying the technique, researching and testing it over the course of about thirteen years to reproduce it.&lt;ref name="Craft: Jewelry: Brooch"/&gt;  Because the technique was not being practiced, and there were no instructional texts in existence, the work was slow, and Craver had to design her own tools.  On the technique, Craver said "it took forever, because this was such an ancient technique and no one knew a darn thing about it.  I just had to start out and do it myself."&lt;ref name="Schon"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schon |first1=Marbeth |last2= |first2= |year=2006 |title=Margret Craver Withers: in service of silver |journal=The Modernism Magazine |volume=8 |issue= |pages=90–97 |publisher=Modernism Magazine |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hierarchical proportion''' is a technique used in art, mostly in [[sculpture]] and [[painting]], in which the artist uses unnatural [[Body proportions|proportion]] or [[scale (ratio)|scale]] to depict the relative importance of the figures in the artwork.

For example, in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] times, people of higher status would sometimes be drawn or sculpted larger than those of lower status.

During the Dark Ages, people with more status had larger proportions than serfs. During the Renaissance images of the human body began to change proportion was used to depict the reality an artist interpreted.

{{Hinduism}}
'''Hindu art''' encompasses the artistic traditions and styles culturally connected to [[Hinduism]] and have a long history of religious association with Hindu scriptures, rituals and worship.

==Background==
[[Hinduism]], with its [[Hinduism by country|1 billion followers]], it makes up about 15% of the world’s population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape - Hinduism|url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-hindu.aspx|work=A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World’s Major Religious Groups as of 2010|publisher=The pew foundation|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such the culture that ensues it is full of different aspects of life that are effected by art.  There are 64 traditional arts that are followed that start with the classics of music and range all the way to the application and adornment of jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;”Heart of Hinduism: Sanskrit and Sanskriti (Culture).” 2004, 30 Mar 2009. &lt; http://hinduism.iskcon.com/lifestyle/801.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since religion and culture are inseparable with Hinduism recurring symbols such as the gods and their reincarnations, the [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]] flower, extra limbs, and even the traditional arts make their appearances in many sculptures, paintings, music, and dance.

*Singing
*Instrumental music
**Learning music in [[Hindu culture]] was a difficult task before the 20th century because of a necessary birth into a [[gharana]]. After the early 1920s integration of anyone wanting to learn classical Hindustani music could. An average ensemble normally includes a harmonium (which was brought to India by westerners), flute, [[veena]], [[sitar]], swaramandala, and a tabla. Many of the songs have strong themes that are related to theology such as a god’s favorite pastimes, praise of any god whether they be in their original form from “the trinity” or the god's reincarnation, even stories of the creation of earth. Since instrumental music is a performance art it must follow strict guidelines that come from the treatise Natya Shastra.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Beck, Guy. “Hindu music, now and into the future.” Hinduism Today October/November/December 2007. 28-31. &lt; http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1515&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dancing
*Painting
**Indian variety - the different types of folk paintings are proud for Indian culture which reflects beauty, tradition and heritage of India. There are many types of traditional paintings like [[Madhubani art|Madhubani]], Rajsthani, [[Batik|Batik-Art]], Patachitra, Gond, Mandala, [[Warli|Tribal Art Warli]], [[Pithora (painting)|Pithora]], Bengali, Nirmal, [[Mysore painting|Mysore]], [[Tanjore]] paintings etc. which are the expressions of love, almighty, beauty, truth, tradition and art of each and every region of the India.

**Drapery- The art of drapery has progressed over time. At one point both men and women wore dhotis but around the 14th century that changed and women’s fashion became more intricate thus creating the sari. The drapery involved distinguishes the wearer’s taste, occupation, and social status. The fabrics chosen range from cotton and synthetic fabrics all the way to silk. The fabric chosen depends on what occasion the wearer is going to use the item of clothing for. The draping of the sari comes in four different families: [[Marvari]], [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]], Tribal, and Nivi. The family that the wearer chooses depends on the wearer’s personal taste. The way an item of clothing is draped tells a lot about the wearer such as expression of creativity, progression of fashion, and where the user comes from.&lt;ref&gt;Boulanger, Chantal. “The Remarkable Indian Art of Draping.” Hinduism Today. October/November/December 2008. 60-62. &lt;http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3078&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic Texts on Art Practices==

*Natya Shastra
**The Natya Shastra is the leading guide to the Hindu performing arts. It is based on the Natya Veda, which no longer exists, and is roughly 37 chapters long with 6,000 [[slokas]].&lt;ref&gt;“Natya Shastra: Encyclopedia II.” 29 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Natya_Shastra_-_Text_and_title/id/1793036&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cities Dedicated to the Production of Art==

*Raghupajpur
**This city is solely dedicated to the production of artwork that is driven by the divine forces of Hinduism and these artworks are produced in a traditional fashion. The city is located in Eastern India (Orissa) and at one point this city was at risk of being completely destroyed due to British rule{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}. During this time religion and the power of the kings were being overthrown and as such there was no reason for a city to exist whose main purpose is to supply traditional art. After this crisis occurred the city began to exclusively base itself on agriculture until a man named Jacnnath Mopatra led a training center for chitrakars. This revolution began production of the traditional art works once again in the 1950s and since the work being produced is known internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Mohanty, M.P. “Living, Painting, Worshipping Art.” Hinduism Today. July/August/September 2007. 54-59. &lt;http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1562&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common Symbols==

*Extra Limbs-Extra limbs are seen on many of the Hindu deities in paintings and sculptures. The extra limbs show how much power the god is capable of because of their ability to perform many tasks at once. Such as the goddess [[Sarasvati]] always has a minimum of four arms. Two of the arms will be playing a vina, representing the tuning of her knowledge, prayer beads in another hand and a scripture in another, both of these items are used to represent her devotion to her spirituality. Since she is the goddess of learning and art we see that she is very capable and very powerful in her area of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Knapp. “Saravasti, the Goddess of Learning.” 20 Mar 2009. &lt; http://www.stephen-knapp.com/sarasvati_goddess_of_learning.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lotus Flower-The lotus flower is another common item seen constantly throughout the arts. The lotus flower represents purity, beauty, prosperity, fertility, and transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;Anil K. Goel, Lucknow. “God’s Favorite Flower.” Hinduism Today. 1999. 15 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4411&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason the flower shows these attributes is due to the process in which the lotus flower goes through in order to blossom. The flower grows out of mud and rests atop the water in which it grows showing the hardship it must endure in order to achieve maximum beauty. Many deities have their name based on the Sanskrit word for lotus such as Lakshimi.&lt;ref&gt;“Lotus-Hindu Symbols” Religion Facts. 2007. 15 Apr 2009. &lt; http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/symbols/lotus.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''International Art Markets''''', subtitled '''''The Essential Guide for Collectors and Investors''''', is a book, compiled and edited by James Goodwin. 

In 42 country art market chapters, plus one regional chapter, the book's aim is to detail the multitude of influences on each country’s art market for the benefit of new or existing [[art collector]]s and [[investor]]s. The book includes chapters on 21 countries from [[Europe]], 12 from [[Asia]] and [[Australasia]], five from [[South America]], four from the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]], and two from [[North America]].

Written by 58 mostly locally based experts from the art trade, each chapter provides  an introduction to the art market; a summary of each individual market and their history; market structure and performance, including artists, dealers, [[auctioneer]]s, [[Art exhibition|fairs]], [[trade association]]s, [[museum]]s, exhibitions, and education; and tax and regulation.

Although a songwriter herself, Baez generally interprets other composers' work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94315624 |title=Joan Baez: Playing For 'Tomorrow' |last=Hansen |first=Liane |date=September 7, 2008 |publisher=National Public Radio |access-date=September 15, 2017 |quote=Reinterpreting other musicians' songs is nothing new to Baez, who says she considers herself more an interpreter than a songwriter.}}&lt;/ref&gt; having recorded songs by [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Allman Brothers Band]], [[the Beatles]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Violeta Parra]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Stevie Wonder]] and many others. On her past several albums, she has found success interpreting songs of more recent songwriters, including [[Ryan Adams]], [[Josh Ritter]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Natalie Merchant]] and [[Joe Henry]].

She began her recording career in 1960 and achieved immediate success. Her first three albums, ''[[Joan Baez (album)|Joan Baez]]'', ''[[Joan Baez, Vol. 2]]'', and ''[[Joan Baez in Concert]]'' all achieved [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{

Baez was born on [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on January 9, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joanbaez.com/chronology.html |title=Chronology |publisher=Joan Baez official website |accessdate=January 13, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506020524/http://joanbaez.com/chronology.html |archivedate=May 6, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan's grandfather, the [[Reverend]] Alberto Baez, left the [[Catholic Church]] to become a [[Methodist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] and moved to the U.S. when her father was two years old. Her father, [[Albert Baez]] (1912–2007), was born in [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;Liberatore, Paul (May 20, 2007).

Her mother, Joan Baez (née Bridge), referred to as Joan Senior or "Big Joan", was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1913 as the second daughter of an English Anglican priest who claimed to be descended from the [[Duke of Chandos|Dukes of Chandos]].&lt;ref&gt;Londoner's Diary (March 19, 2012) • [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/duke-forced-on-defensive-over-wind-turbines-7577552.html ''From hippy trail to the aristocracy''] • ''www.thisislondon.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davison |first=Phil |date=April 25, 2013 |title=Obituary: Joan Bridge Baez, anti-war activist|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-joan-bridge-baez-anti-war-activist-1-2907804 |work=The Scotsman |access-date=August 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in April 1913, she died on April 20, 2013, days after her one hundredth birthday.&lt;ref name="PAO2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/show_story.php?id=29411|title=Mother of Joan Baez dies at 100|last=Boyce|first=Dave|date=April 25, 2013|publisher=Palo Alto Online|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baez had two sisters – Pauline Thalia Baez Bryan (1938–2016), who was sometimes professionally known as Pauline Marden; and Margarita Mimi Baez Fariña (1945–2001) who was generally better known as [[Mimi Fariña]]. To varying degrees, both women were also political activists and musicians like their sister. They are also notable for having been married to other American artists – Pauline (briefly) to painter [[Brice Marden]] and Mimi to author and musician [[Richard Fariña]] with whom she collaborated for several years.

The Baez family converted to [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakerism]] during Joan's early childhood, and she has continued to identify with the tradition, particularly in her commitment to [[pacifism]] and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postcity.com/Eat-Shop-Do/Do/November-2011/Q-A-Joan-Baez-on-activism-performing-in-TO-and-the-Quaker-tradition/|title=Q&amp;A: Joan Baez on religion, the Occupy movement and her rare T.O. concert appearance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While growing up, Baez was subjected to racial slurs and discrimination due to her [[Mexicans|Mexican]] heritage. Consequently, she became involved with a variety of social causes early in her career. She declined to play in any white student venues that were segregated, which meant that when she toured the Southern states, she would play only at black colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/joanbaez/a/joan_baez.htm?ad=semD&amp;an=google_s&amp;am=broad&amp;q=joan%20baez%20autobiography&amp;dqi=Joan%2520Baez%2520ethnicity&amp;o=22856&amp;l=sem&amp;qsrc=999&amp;askid=730a6619-e22f-47c0-96a8-27f54b54e0c0-0-ab_gsb |title=Biography of Joan Baez | publisher=about education |date= |accessdate=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to her father's work with [[UNESCO]], their family moved many times, living in towns across the U.S, as well as in England, France, Switzerland, Spain, Canada, and the Middle East, including [[Iraq]]. Joan Baez became involved with a variety of social causes early in her career, including [[civil rights]] and [[non-violence]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Ernie (2007).

The opening line of Baez's memoir ''And a Voice to Sing With'' is "I was born gifted" (referencing her singing voice, which she explained was given to her and for which she can take no credit).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4Lw5Y0nsWd0C&amp;pg=PR25&amp;lpg=PR25&amp;dq=Joan+Baez+%22I+was+born+gifted%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wmyfUVR_rt&amp;sig=AKBQ9TgtQBlskqofPJTB-_vO8dE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VawSU9aUO4zMkgWamID4Cg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Joan%20Baez%20%22I%20was%20born%20gifted%22&amp;f=false And a Voice to Sing With: A Memoir].

She learned four chords, which enabled her to play [[rhythm and blues]], the music she was listening to at the time. Her parents, however, were fearful that the music would lead her into a life of [[drug addiction]].&lt;ref name="DemNow2009"&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2009/5/4/legendary_folk_singer_activist_pete_seeger Democracy Now, May 4, 2009] (transcript).

The concert was in 1954 at Palo Alto High School. It was a fundraiser for the California Democratic Party.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--EDITOR NOTE: The sentence of this Wikipedia article that I am replacing (on January 5, 2014) with the sentence to which this footnote applies states mistakenly that Baez was eight years old when she went to that Pete Seeger concert.  The source that was given, in this Wikipedia article, for that mistaken information is this webpage: &lt;http://www.democracynow.org/2009/5/4/legendary_folk_singer_activist_pete_seeger&gt;. If you read the paragraph at that webpage that mentions going to Seeger's concert and the paragraph after it, you will see why the inference that Baez was eight at the time is a mistake. --&gt; She soon began practicing the songs of his [[Musical repertoire|repertoire]] and performing them publicly. One of her very earliest public performances was at a retreat in [[Saratoga, California]] for a youth group from Temple Beth Jacob, a [[Redwood City, California]] Jewish congregation. A few years later in 1957, Baez bought her first [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] acoustic guitar.

===College music scene in Massachusetts===
In 1958, her father accepted a faculty position at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and moved his family to Massachusetts. At that time, it was in the center of the up-and-coming folk-music scene, and Baez began performing near home in Boston and nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]. She also performed in clubs, and attended [[Boston University]] for about six weeks.&lt;ref name="American Masters" /&gt; In 1958, at the [[Club Passim|Club 47]] in Cambridge, she gave her first concert. When designing the poster for the performance, Baez considered changing her performing name to either Rachel Sandperl, the surname of her long-time mentor, Ira Sandperl, or Maria from the song "[[They Call the Wind Maria]]". She later opted against doing so, fearing that people would accuse her of changing her last name because it was Spanish. The audience consisted of her parents, her sister Mimi, her boyfriend, and a few friends, resulting in a total of eight patrons. She was paid ten dollars. Baez was later asked back and began performing twice a week for $25 per show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= And A Voice To Sing With|last= Baez|first= Joan |authorlink= |author2= |year= 1987|publisher= Summit Books|location= |isbn= 5-551-88863-0|page= 63 |pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=v2tocQYV1owC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=joan+baez+mitch+miller&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Kc5VTKuWLZP2swO-m4TYDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later, Baez and two other folk enthusiasts made plans to record an album in the cellar of a friend's house. The three sang solos and duets, a family friend designed the album cover, and it was released on Veritas Records that same year as ''[[Folksingers 'Round Harvard Square]]''. Baez later met [[Bob Gibson (musician)|Bob Gibson]] and [[Odetta]], who were at the time two of the most prominent vocalists singing [[folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music]]. Baez cites Odetta as a primary influence along with [[Marian Anderson]] and Pete Seeger.&lt;ref&gt;Baez, Joan. ''And a Voice to Sing With: A Memoir''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2009, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson invited Baez to perform with him at the 1959 [[Newport Folk Festival]], where the two sang two duets, "Virgin Mary Had One Son" and "We Are Crossing Jordan River".&lt;ref name=pc19 /&gt; The performance generated substantial praise for the "barefoot Madonna" with the otherworldly voice, and it was this appearance that led to Baez signing with [[Vanguard Records]] the following year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= And A Voice To Sing With|last= Baez|first= Joan |authorlink= |author2= |year= 1987|publisher= Summit Books|location= |isbn= 5-551-88863-0|page= 62 |pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=v2tocQYV1owC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=joan+baez+mitch+miller&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Kc5VTKuWLZP2swO-m4TYDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Columbia Records]] tried to sign her first.&lt;ref&gt;Baez, Joan (1987).

Debolt, James S. Baugess – The Encyclopedia of the Sixties: A Decade of Culture 1440801029 Page 48 "She received the nickname "Madonna" because of the soulful clarity of her soprano voice, long hair, and natural beauty."&lt;/ref&gt; and to her role as "Earth Mother".&lt;ref&gt;Terrie M. Rooney  Newsmakers 1998: The People Behind Today's Headlines 0787612308 – 1999  Page 17 "With her pure, three-octave soprano voice, her long hair and natural good looks, and her unpretentious presence, she came to earn the nickname "Madonna" because she represented the "Earth Mother" for the 1960s generation."&lt;/ref&gt;

===First albums and 1960s breakthrough===
[[File:Joan Baez 1963.jpg|right|thumb | alt=Baez stands behind a too-tall podium bristling with microphones, wearing a plaid sleeveless top, longish hair in a feather cut | Baez playing at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] in August 1963]]
Her true professional career began at the 1959 Newport Folk Festival. Following that appearance, she recorded her first album for Vanguard, ''[[Joan Baez (album)|Joan Baez]]'' (1960), produced by [[Fred Hellerman]] of [[The Weavers]], who produced many albums by folk artists. The collection of traditional folk [[Ballad (music)|ballads]], blues, and [[lament]]s sung to her own guitar accompaniment sold moderately well. It featured many popular [[Child Ballads]] of the day and was recorded in only four days in the ballroom of New York City's Manhattan Towers Hotel. The album also included "[[Gracias a la Vida (album)#Track listing|El Preso Numero Nueve]]", a song sung entirely in Spanish, which she would re-record in 1974 for inclusion on her Spanish-language album, ''[[Gracias a la Vida (album)|Gracias a la Vida]]''.

She made her New York concert debut on November 5, 1960, at the [[92nd Street Y]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joanbaez.com/chronology.html|title=The Joan Baez Web Pages|website=www.joanbaez.com|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on November 11, 1961, Baez played her first major New York concert at a sold-out performance at Town Hall. Robert Shelton, folk critic of the New York Times, praised the concert, saying, "That superb soprano voice, as lustrous and rich as old gold, flowed purely all evening with a wondrous ease. Her singing (unwound) like a spool of satin." (Stu Steadman (2017). "This Day in Rock." www.thisdayinrock.com) Years later when Baez thought back to that concert, she laughed, saying: "I remember in 1961 my manager sending me this newspaper (clipping) in the mail (which) read, 'Joan Baez Town Hall Concert, SRO.' I thought SRO meant 'sold right out.' I was so innocent of it all." (David A. Maurer (March 10, 2016). "Joan Baez: Folk Singer, Hereditary Activist." "The Daily Progress.")
     
Her second release, ''[[Joan Baez, Vol. 2]]'' (1961), went "[[Music recording sales certification|gold]]", as did ''[[Joan Baez in Concert]], Part 1'' (1962) and ''[[Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2]]'' (1963). Like its immediate predecessor, ''Joan Baez, Vol. 2'' contained strictly traditional material. Her two albums of live material, ''Joan Baez in Concert, Part 1'' and its second counterpart, were unique in that unlike most live albums they contained only new songs rather than established favorites. It was ''Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2'' that featured Baez's first-ever Dylan cover.

From the early-to-mid-1960s, Baez emerged at the forefront of the American [[roots revival]], where she introduced her audiences to the then-unknown Bob Dylan, and was emulated by artists such as [[Judy Collins]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Joni Mitchell]], and [[Bonnie Raitt]]. On November 23, 1962, Baez appeared on the cover of ''Time Magazine''—a rare honor then for a musician.

Though primarily an album artist, several of Baez' singles have charted, the first being her 1965 cover of [[Phil Ochs]]' "There but for Fortune", which became a mid-level chart hit in the U.S. and a top-ten single in the United Kingdom.

Baez added other instruments to her recordings on ''[[Farewell, Angelina]]'' (1965), which features several Dylan songs interspersed with more traditional fare.

Deciding to experiment with different styles, Baez turned to [[Peter Schickele]], a classical music composer, who provided classical orchestration for her next three albums: ''[[Noël (Joan Baez album)|Noël]]'' (1966), ''[[Joan (album)|Joan]]'' (1967), and ''[[Baptism: A Journey Through Our Time]]'' (1968). ''Noël'' was a Christmas album of traditional material, while ''Baptism'' was akin to a [[concept album]], featuring Baez reading and singing poems written by celebrated poets such as [[James Joyce]], [[Federico García Lorca]], and [[Walt Whitman]]. ''Joan'' featured interpretations of work by then-contemporary composers, including [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]], [[Tim Hardin]], [[Paul Simon]], and [[Donovan]].

In 1968, Baez traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where a marathon recording session resulted in two albums. The first, ''[[Any Day Now (Joan Baez album)|Any Day Now]]'' (1968), consists exclusively of Dylan covers. The other, the country-music-infused ''[[David's Album]]'' (1969), was recorded for then-husband [[David Harris (protester)|David Harris]], a prominent anti-[[Vietnam War]] protester eventually imprisoned for [[draft resistance]]. Harris, a country-music fan, turned Baez toward more complex [[country rock|country-rock]] influences beginning with ''David's Album''.

Later in 1968, she published her first memoir, ''Daybreak'' (by [[Dial Press]]). In 1969, her appearance at Woodstock in upstate New York afforded her an international musical and political podium, particularly upon the successful release of the documentary film ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' (1970).

Beginning in the late 1960s, Baez began writing many of her own songs, beginning with "Sweet Sir Galahad" and "A Song For David," both songs appearing on her 1970 ''[[(I Live) One Day at a Time]]'' album; "Sweet Sir Galahad" was written about her sister Mimi's second marriage, while "A Song For David" was a tribute to Harris. ''One Day at a Time'', like ''David's Album'', featured a decidedly country sound.

Baez's distinctive vocal style and political activism had a significant impact on popular music. She was one of the first musicians to use her popularity as a vehicle for social protest, singing and marching for human rights and peace. [[Pete Seeger]], [[Odetta]], and decades-long friend [[Harry Belafonte]] were her early social justice advocate influences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/joan-baez-9195061|title=Joan Baez|website=Biography.com|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baez came to be considered the "most accomplished interpretive folksinger/songwriter of the 1960s".&lt;ref name = Baez1941&gt;[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3830.html Joan Baez].

===1970s and the end of Vanguard years===
[[File:Joan Baez Hamburg 1973 2811730005.jpg |thumb|left |Baez playing in Hamburg, 1973| alt=Joan Baez playing on stage in a Hamburg TV studio, 1973]]
After eleven years with Vanguard, Baez decided in 1971 to cut ties with the label that had released her albums since 1960. She delivered them one last success with the gold-selling album ''[[Blessed Are ...]]'' (1971) which included a top-ten hit in "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down", her cover of [[The Band]]'s signature song. With ''[[Come from the Shadows]]'' (1972), Baez switched to [[A&amp;M Records]], where she remained for four years and six albums.

Joan Baez wrote "The Story of Bangladesh" in 1971. This song was based on the Pakistani army crackdown on unarmed sleeping Bengali students at Dhaka University on March 25, 1971, which ignited the prolonged nine-month [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/joan_baez260306.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407094644/http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/joan_baez260306.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 7, 2014|title=Joan Baez and our Liberation War Avijit Roy|date=April 7, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was later entitled "The Song of Bangladesh" and released in a 1972 album from Chandos Music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joanbaez.com/Lyrics/bangladesh.html Words and Music by Joan Baez, Song of Bangladesh], lyrics joanbaez.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period in late 1971, she reunited with composer [[Peter Schickele]] to record two tracks, "Rejoice in the Sun" and "Silent Running" for the [[science fiction|science-fiction]] film ''[[Silent Running]]''. The two songs were issued as a single on [[Decca Records|Decca]] (32890). In addition to this, another LP was released on Decca (DL 7-9188) and was later reissued by [[Varèse Sarabande]] on black (STV-81072) and green (VC-81072) vinyl. In 1998, a limited release on CD by the "Valley Forge Record Groupe" was released.

Baez's first album for A&amp;M, ''[[Come from the Shadows]]'', was recorded in Nashville, and included a number of more personal compositions, including "Love Song to a Stranger" and "Myths", as well as work by Mimi Farina, John Lennon, and Anna Marly.

''[[Where Are You Now, My Son?]]'' (1973) featured a 23-minute title song which took up all of the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the album. Half [[spoken word]] poem and half tape-recorded sounds, the song documented Baez's visit to [[Hanoi]], [[North Vietnam]], in December 1972 during which she and her traveling companions survived the 11-day-long [[Christmas Bombings]] campaign over Hanoi and [[Haiphong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2002/12/26/joan_baez Democracy Now, December 26, 2002] (audio). Interview with Joan Baez by Amy Goodman.  ''[[Democracy Now]]''. Retrieved June 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See Vietnam War in [[Joan Baez#Civil Rights|Civil rights]] section below.)''

''[[Gracias a la Vida (album)|Gracias a la Vida]]'' (1974) (the title song written and first performed by Chilean folk singer [[Violeta Parra]]) followed and was a success in both the U.S. and Latin America. It included the song "[[Cucurrucucú paloma]]". Flirting with mainstream pop music as well as writing her own songs for ''[[Diamonds &amp; Rust]]'' (1975), the album became the highest selling of Baez's career and included a second top-ten single in the form of the title track.

After ''[[Gulf Winds]]'' (1976), an album of entirely self-composed songs and ''[[From Every Stage]]'' (1976), a live album that had Baez performing songs "from every stage" of her career, Baez again parted ways with a record label when she moved to [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] for ''[[Blowin' Away]]'' (1977) and ''[[Honest Lullaby]]'' (1979).

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1980, Baez was given honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] degrees by [[Antioch University]] and [[Rutgers University]] for her political activism and the "universality of her music". In 1983, she appeared on the [[Grammy Awards]], performing Dylan's anthemic "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]", a song she first performed twenty years earlier.

Santana in workman's shirt &amp; knit cap. | [[Bob Dylan]], Joan Baez, [[Carlos Santana]], performing in May 1984, [[Hamburg]].]]

Baez also played a significant role in the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert for African famine relief, opening the U.S. segment of the show in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. She has toured on behalf of many other causes, including [[Amnesty International]]'s 1986 ''[[A Conspiracy of Hope]]'' tour and a guest spot on their subsequent ''[[Human Rights Now!]]'' tour.

Baez found herself without an American label for the release of ''[[Live -Europe '83|Live Europe 83]]'' (1984), which was released in Europe and Canada but not released commercially in the U.S. She did not have an American release until the album ''[[Recently (album)|Recently]]'' (1987) on [[Gold Castle Records]].

In 1987, Baez's second autobiography called ''And a Voice to Sing With'' was published and became a ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller. That same year, she traveled to the Middle East to visit with and sing songs of peace for [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]].

In May 1989, Baez performed at a music festival in [[communism|communist]] [[Czechoslovakia]] called Bratislavská lýra. While there, she met future [[List of Presidents of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakian president]] [[Václav Havel]], whom she let carry her guitar so as to prevent his arrest by government agents. During her performance, she greeted members of [[Charter 77]], a dissident human-rights group, which resulted in her microphone being shut off abruptly. Baez then proceeded to sing ''[[a cappella]]'' for the nearly four thousand gathered. Havel cited her as a great inspiration and influence in that country's [[Velvet Revolution]], the revolution in which the Soviet-dominated communist government there was overthrown.

Baez recorded two more albums with Gold Castle: ''[[Speaking of Dreams]]'', (1989) and ''[[Brothers in Arms (Joan Baez album)|Brothers in Arms]]'' (1991). She then landed a contract with a major label, [[Virgin Records]], recording ''[[Play Me Backwards]]'' (1992) for Virgin shortly before the company was purchased by [[EMI]]. She then switched to Guardian, with whom she produced a live album, ''[[Ring Them Bells]]'' (1995), and a studio album, ''[[Gone from Danger]]'' (1997).

In 1993, at the invitation of [[Refugees International]] and sponsored by the [[Soros Foundation]], she traveled to the war-torn [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] region of former-[[Yugoslavia]] in an effort to help bring more attention to the suffering there. She was the first major artist to perform in [[Sarajevo]] since the outbreak of the [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslav civil war]].

In October of that year, Baez became the first major artist to perform in a professional concert presentation on [[Alcatraz Island]] (a former [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|U.S. federal prison]]) in San Francisco, California, in a benefit for her sister Mimi's Bread and Roses organization. She later returned for another concert in 1996.

===2000s===
Beginning in 2001, Baez has had several successful long-term engagements as a lead character at San Francisco's [[Teatro ZinZanni]].&lt;ref name="BaezSFChron"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/12/DD231448.DTL |title= Now it's Countess Baez |first= Steve|last= Winn |work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date= October 12, 2001 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2001, Vanguard began re-releasing Baez's first 13 albums, which she recorded for the label between 1960 and 1971. The reissues, being released through Vanguard's Original Master Series, feature digitally restored sound, unreleased bonus songs, new and original artwork, and new [[liner notes|liner-note]] essays written by Arthur Levy. Likewise, her six A&amp;M albums were reissued in 2003.

On October 1, 2005, she performed at the [[Hardly Strictly Bluegrass]] festival, at San Francisco's [[Golden Gate Park]]. Then, on January 13, 2006, Baez performed at the funeral of [[Lou Rawls]], where she led [[Jesse Jackson]], Sr., Wonder, and others in the singing of "[[Amazing Grace]]". On June 6, 2006, Baez joined [[Bruce Springsteen]] on stage at his San Francisco concert, where the two performed the rolling anthem "[[Pay Me My Money Down]]". In September 2006, Baez contributed a live, retooled version of her classic song "Sweet Sir Galahad" to a [[Starbucks]]'s exclusive XM Artist Confidential album. In the new version, she changed the lyric "here's to the dawn of their days" to "here's to the dawn of ''her'' days", as a tribute to her late sister Mimi, about whom Baez wrote the song in 1969. Later on, October 8, 2006, she appeared as a special surprise guest at the opening ceremony of the [[Forum 2000]] international conference in [[Prague]], Czech Republic. Her performance was kept secret from former [[President of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic President]] Havel until the moment she appeared on stage. Havel was a great admirer of both Baez and her work. During Baez's next visit to Prague, in April 2007, the two met again when she performed in front of a sold-out house at Prague's [[Lucerna Music Bar#Lucerna Palace|Lucerna Hall]], a building erected by Havel's grandfather. On December 2, 2006, she made a guest appearance at the [[Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir]]'s Christmas Concert at the [[Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theatre]] in [[Oakland]], California. Her participation included versions of "[[Songs of the Underground Railroad#Songs Associated with the Underground Railroad|Let Us Break Bread Together]]" and "[[Amazing Grace]]". She also joined the choir in the finale of "[[O Holy Night]]".[[File:Dresden 07 2008 135 (2684499251).jpg|thumb|left | alt=Baez plays outdoors in brown wide-leg pants, white top, brown waistcoat, blue pearls, and a long orange neck scarf.

In February 2007, [[Proper Records]] reissued her live album ''Ring Them Bells'' (1995), which featured duets with artists ranging from [[Dar Williams]] and Mimi Fariña to the [[Indigo Girls]] and [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]]. The reissue features a 16-page booklet and six unreleased live tracks from the original recording sessions, including "[[Love Song To A Stranger]]", "[[You Ain't Goin' Nowhere]]", "[[Geordie (ballad)|Geordie]]", "[[Gracias a la Vida]]", "[[The Water Is Wide (song)|The Water Is Wide]]" and "[[Stones in the Road]]", bringing the total track listing to 21 songs (on two discs). In addition, Baez recorded a duet of "Jim Crow" with [[John Mellencamp]] which appears on his album ''[[Freedom's Road]]'' (2007). He has called the album a "[[Woody Guthrie]] rock album".

===2010s===
On April 4, 2017, Baez used Facebook to release her first song in twenty-seven years, "Nasty Man", a protest song against US President [[Donald Trump]]; it became a viral hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/joan-baez-donald-trump-song_us_58e73645e4b00de141020429|title=Joan Baez Tears Into 'Future Dictator' Donald Trump In New 'Nasty Man' Song|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=April 7, 2017|first=Lee|last=Moran|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://subscriber.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/joan-baez-virgin-mary-outrageous-flirt/|title=Joan Baez: 'I'm the Virgin Mary ... and an outrageous flirt'|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=March 4, 2018|first=Helen|last=Brown|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 7, 2017, she was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/04/08/pearl-jam-tupac-journey-and-joan-baez-inducted-into-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame|title=Pearl Jam, Tupac, Journey and Joan Baez inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 8, 2017|first=Ellen|last=McCarthy|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, 2018, she released a new studio album entitled ''[[Whistle Down the Wind (album)|Whistle Down the Wind]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/whistle-down-the-wind-mw0003141770|title=Whistle Down the Wind – Joan Baez|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been undertaking her "Fare Thee Well Tour" to support the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/02/joan-baez-announces-final-north-american-tour.html|title=Joan Baez Announces Final Career Tour Dates|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=February 26, 2018|first=Matthew|last=Oshinsky|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and political involvement==
To reward her decades of dedicated activism, Baez was honoured with the Spirit of Americana/Free Speech award at the 2008 [[Americana Music Honors &amp; Awards]].

===1950s===
In 1956, Baez first heard [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.,]] speak about nonviolence, civil rights and [[social change]] which brought tears to her eyes.&lt;ref name="American Masters" /&gt; Several years later, the two became friends,&lt;ref name="American Masters" /&gt; with Baez participating in many of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] demonstrations that Dr. King helped organize.

In 1958, at age 17, Baez committed her first act of [[civil disobedience]] by refusing to leave her [[Palo Alto High School]] classroom in [[Palo Alto, California]], for an [[Civil defense#History|air raid drill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''Palo Alto Times'' (archived w/clipping at Conelrad.com)|date= February 7, 1958 |title='Conscientious objector' stays at school during test|url=http://www.conelrad.com/atomicsecrets/secrets.php?secrets=10#newspaper|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|title=Joan Baez on the hunger front|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] (via Proquest) |first=Louise |last=Sweeney|date=November 13, 1979|page=B6|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/access/187036832.html?dids=187036832:187036832&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI

===Civil rights===
The early years of Baez's career saw the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the U.S. become a prominent issue. Her performance of "[[We Shall Overcome]]", the civil rights anthem written by [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Guy Carawan]], at the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] permanently linked her to the song. Baez again sang "We Shall Overcome" in [[Sproul Plaza]] during the mid-1960s [[Free Speech Movement]] demonstrations at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in [[Berkeley, California]], and at many other rallies and protests.

Her recording of the song "[[Birmingham Sunday]]" (1964), written by her brother-in-law, Richard Fariña, was used in the opening of ''[[4 Little Girls]]'' (1997), [[Spike Lee]]'s documentary film about the four young victims killed in the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]].

In 1965, Baez announced that she would be opening a school to teach nonviolent protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swanekamp|first=Joan|title=Diamonds &amp; Rust: a Bibliography and Discography on Joan Baez|year=1980|publisher=The Pierian Press|isbn=0-87650-113-7|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also participated in the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] for voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Vietnam War===
Highly visible in civil-rights marches, Baez became more vocal about her disagreement with the Vietnam War. In 1964, she publicly endorsed [[tax resistance|resisting taxes]] by withholding sixty percent of her 1963 income taxes. In 1964, she founded the [[Institute for the Study of Nonviolence]] (along with her mentor Sandperl) and encouraged draft resistance at her concerts. The Institute for the Study of Nonviolence would later branch into the Resource Center for Nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joanbaez.com/links.html |title=The Joan Baez Web Pages |publisher=Joanbaez.com |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316164626/http://www.joanbaez.com/links.html |archive-date=March 16, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Baez's autobiography, ''Daybreak'', was released. It is the most detailed report of her life through 1966 and outlined her anti-war position, dedicating the book to men facing imprisonment for resisting the draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swanekamp|first=Joan|title=Diamonds &amp; Rust: a Bibliography and Discography on Joan Baez|year=1980|publisher=The Pierian Press|isbn=0-87650-113-7|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baez was arrested twice in 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/16/newsid_2535000/2535301.stm | work=BBC News | title=1967: Joan Baez arrested in Vietnam protest | date=October 16, 1967 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for blocking the entrance of the Armed Forces Induction Center in Oakland, California, and spent over a month in jail. ''(See also [[Joan Baez#David Harris|David Harris]] section below.)''

She was a frequent participant in anti-war marches and rallies, including:

* numerous protests in New York City organized by the [[Fifth Avenue Vietnam Peace Parade Committee]], starting with the March 1966 Fifth Avenue Peace Parade;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Antiwar Protests Staged in U.S.; 15 Burn Discharge Papers Here; Hundreds Cheer at Union Square Rally Arrests Made Across the Country 5th Avenue Parade Set Today | author= Robinson, Douglas | work=The New York Times | format=$ |date=March 26, 1966|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/03/26/archives/antiwar-protests-staged-in-us-15-burn-discharge-papers-here.html |accessdate=February 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a free 1967 concert at the [[Washington Monument]] in Washington, D.C., that had been opposed by the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] which attracted a crowd of 30,000 to hear her anti-war message;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=30,000 in Capital at Free Concert by Joan Baez; Folk Singer Chides D.A.R., Which Protested U.S. Site | author=B.

* the 1969 [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam]] protests.

There were many others, culminating in Phil Ochs's [[The War Is Over (Phil Ochs song)|The War Is Over]] celebration in New York City in May 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=End-of-War Rally Brings Out 50,000; Peace Rally Here Brings Out 50,000 | author= [[Paul L. Montgomery|Montgomery, Paul L.]] | work=The New York Times | date=May 12, 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Christmas season 1972, Baez joined a peace delegation traveling to North Vietnam, both to address human rights in the region, and to deliver Christmas mail to American [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. During her time there, she was caught in the U.S. military's "[[Operation Linebacker II|Christmas bombing]]" of Hanoi, North Vietnam, during which the city was bombed for eleven straight days.

Her disquiet at the human-rights violations of communist Vietnam made her increasingly critical of its government and she organized the May 30, 1979, publication of a full-page advertisement (published in four major U.S. newspapers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Joan Baez starts protest on repression by Hanoi | work=The New York Times | date=May 30, 1979 | page=A14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the communists were described as having created a nightmare. Her one-time anti-war ally, [[Jane Fonda]], refused to join in Baez's criticism of Hanoi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/01/archives/peace-activists-attack-vietnam-on-rights-a-painful-nightmare-heard.html|title=Peace Activists Attack Vietnam on Rights|date=June 1, 1979|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/blog/11490|title=Joan Baez v.

===Human rights===
Baez was instrumental in founding the USA section of [[Amnesty International]] in the 1970s, and has remained an active supporter of the organization.

Baez's experiences regarding Vietnam's human-rights violations ultimately led her to found her own human-rights group in the late 1970s, Humanitas International, whose focus was to target oppression wherever it occurred, criticizing right and left-wing régimes equally.

In 1976, she was awarded the [[Thomas Merton Award]] for her ongoing activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/560/000022494/ |title=Joan Baez |publisher=Nndb.com |date= |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She toured Chile, Brazil and Argentina in 1981, but was prevented from performing in any of the three countries, for fear her criticism of their human-rights practices would reach mass audiences if she were given a podium. While there, she was kept under surveillance and subjected to death threats. A film of the ill-fated tour, ''[[There but for Fortune: Joan Baez in Latin America]]'', was shown on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in 1982.

In 1989, after the [[Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989|Tiananmen Massacre]] in Beijing, Baez wrote and released the song "China" to condemn the Chinese government for its violent and bloody crackdown on thousands of student protesters who called for establishment of democratic republicanism.

In a second trip to Southeast Asia, Baez assisted in an effort to take food and medicine into the western regions of Cambodia, and participated in a [[History of Cambodia|United Nations Humanitarian Conference on Kampuchea]].

On July 17, 2006, Baez received the Distinguished Leadership Award from the [[Legal Community Against Violence]]. At the annual dinner event, they honored her for her lifetime of work against violence of all kinds.

In 2015, Baez received the [[Ambassador of Conscience Award]].

In 2016, Baez advocated for the [[Innocence Project]] and [[Innocence Network]]. At each concert, Baez informs the audience about the organizations' efforts to exhonerate the wrongfully convicted and reform the system to prevent such incidents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Opposing the death penalty====
In December 2005, Baez appeared and sang "[[Swing Low, Sweet Chariot]]" at the California protest at the [[San Quentin State Prison]] against the execution of [[Tookie Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Jenifer Warren, Jenifer and Dolan, Maura (December 13, 2005).

====LGBT rights====
Baez has also been prominent in the struggle for [[LGBT rights|gay and lesbian rights]]. In 1978, she performed at several benefit concerts to defeat the [[Briggs Initiative]], which proposed banning all gay people from teaching in the public schools of California. Later that same year, she participated in memorial marches for the assassinated San Francisco city supervisor, [[Harvey Milk]], who was openly gay.

In the 1990s, she appeared with her friend [[Janis Ian]] at a benefit for the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]], a gay lobbying organization, and performed at the San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride March.

Her song "Altar Boy and the Thief" from ''[[Blowin' Away]]'' (1977) was written as a dedication to her gay fanbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blowin' Away|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Joan+Baez/Blowin'+Away|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====
On June 25, 2009, Baez created a special version of "We Shall Overcome"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3jWw-wGoaw |title=Joan Baez "We Shall Overcome" 2009 For Iran |publisher=YouTube |date= July 2, 2009 |accessdate= August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a few lines of [[Persian language|Persian]] lyrics in support of peaceful protests by Iranian people. She recorded it in her home and posted the video on YouTube&lt;ref&gt;Baez, Joan (June 25, 2009). {{YouTube|kVCqPAzI-JY|Joan Baez "We Shall Overcome" (2009)}}; Google Inc.

She dedicated the song "Joe Hill" to the people of Iran during her concert at [[Merrill Auditorium]], [[Portland, Maine]] on July 31, 2009.

===Environmental causes===
On Earth Day 1999&lt;!-- per the citation--&gt;, Baez and [[Bonnie Raitt]] honored environmental activist [[Julia Butterfly Hill|Julia "Butterfly" Hill]] with Raitt's ''Arthur M. Sohcot Award'' in person on her {{convert|180|ft|m|adj=on}}-high redwood treetop platform, where Hill had camped to protect ancient redwoods in the [[Headwaters Forest]] from logging.&lt;ref&gt;Rising Ground, Michael.

===War in Iraq===
In early 2003, Baez performed at two rallies of hundreds of thousands of people in San Francisco protesting the U.S. invasion of Iraq (as she had earlier done before smaller crowds in 1991 to protest the [[Gulf War]]).

In August 2003, she was invited by Emmylou Harris and Steve Earle to join them in London, UK, at the Concert For a Landmine-Free World.

In the summer of 2004, Baez joined [[Michael Moore]]'s "[[Slacker uprising]] Tour" on American college campuses, encouraging young people to get out and vote for peace candidates in the upcoming national election.

In August 2005, Baez appeared at the Texas [[anti-war]] protest that had been started by [[Cindy Sheehan]].

=== Tree sit-in ===
On May 23, 2006, Baez once again joined [[Julia "Butterfly" Hill]], this time in a "tree sit" in a giant tree on the site of the [[South Central Farm]] in a poor neighborhood of downtown Los Angeles, California. Baez and Hill were hoisted into the tree, where they remained overnight. The women, in addition to many other activists and celebrities, were protesting the imminent eviction of the community farmers and demolition of the site, which is the largest urban farm in the state. Because many of the South Central Farmers are immigrants from Central America, Baez sang several songs from her 1974 Spanish-language album, ''Gracias a la Vida'', including the title track and "No Nos Moverán" ("[[We Shall Not Be Moved]]").

===2008 presidential election===
Throughout most of her career, Baez remained apprehensive about involving herself in [[party politics]]. However, on February 3, 2008, Baez wrote a letter to the editor at the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' endorsing [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]]. She noted: "Through all those years, I chose not to engage in party politics.&amp;nbsp;... At this time, however, changing that posture feels like the responsible thing to do. If anyone can navigate the contaminated waters of Washington, lift up the poor, and appeal to the rich to share their wealth, it is Sen. Barack Obama."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joan |last=Baez|title=Leader on a new journey (Letter to the editor)|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/03/ED50UO8QM.DTL|work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 3, 2008 |accessdate=February 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing at the Glastonbury Festival in June, Baez said during the introduction of a song that one reason she likes Obama is because he reminds her of another old friend of hers: Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Mills| first = Paul| title = Joan Baez| work = Review| publisher = [[Glastonbury Festival]] | year = 2008| url = http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/glastonline2008.aspx?id=3443 |accessdate=July 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- CONTENT GONE --&gt;

Although a highly political figure throughout most of her career, Baez had never publicly endorsed a major political party candidate prior to Obama. However, after Obama was elected, she expressed that she would likely never do so again, saying in a 2013 interview in ''The Huffington Post'' that "In some ways I'm disappointed, but in some ways it was silly to expect more.

===Joan Baez Award===
On March 18, 2011, Baez was honored by Amnesty International at its 50th Anniversary Annual General Meeting in San Francisco. The tribute to Baez was the inaugural event for the Amnesty International Joan Baez Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGUSA20110309002&amp;lang=e |title=Joan Baez Award of Amnesty International 2011 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] USA |date=March 9, 2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314233347/http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGUSA20110309002&amp;lang=e |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for Outstanding Inspirational Service in the Global Fight for Human Rights. Baez was presented with the first award in recognition of her human rights work with Amnesty International and beyond, and the inspiration she has given activists around the world. In future years, the award is to be presented to an artist – music, film, sculpture, paint or other medium – who has similarly helped advance human rights.

===Occupy Wall Street===
On November 11, 2011, Baez played as part of a musical concert for the protestors at [[Occupy Wall Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/folk-music-legend-joan-baez-perform-occupy-wall-street-rally-article-1.975888?localLinksEnabled=false |title=Folk music legend Joan Baez to perform at Occupy Wall Street rally |publisher=NY Daily News |date=December 14, 2009 |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her three-song set included "Joe Hill", a cover of the [[Rolling Stones]]' [[Salt of the Earth (song)|"Salt of the Earth"]] and her own composition "Where's My Apple Pie?"

==Personal life==

===Early relationships===
Baez's first real boyfriend was Michael New, a young man whom she met at her college. Years later in 1979, he inspired her song "Michael". New was a fellow student from [[Trinidad]], who, like Baez, attended classes only occasionally. The two spent a considerable amount of time together, but Baez was unable to balance her blossoming career and her relationship. The two bickered and made up repeatedly, but it was apparent to Baez that New was beginning to resent her success and new-found local celebrity. One night she saw him kissing another woman on a street corner. Despite this, the relationship remained intact for several years after the two moved to California together in 1960.

===Bob Dylan===
[[File:Joan Baez Bob Dylan.jpg|thumb | alt=Sitting very close, Baez singing, Dylan with guitar and harmonica | Baez with [[Bob Dylan]] at the civil rights [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]], August 28, 1963]]
Baez first met Dylan in 1961 at [[Gerde's Folk City]] in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]]. At the time, Baez had already released her debut album and her popularity as the emerging "Queen of Folk" was on the rise. Baez was initially unimpressed with the "urban [[hillbilly]]", but was impressed with one of Dylan's first compositions, "[[Song to Woody]]" and remarked that she would like to record it.

At the start, Dylan was more interested in Baez's younger sister Mimi, but under the glare of media scrutiny that began to surround Baez and Dylan, their relationship began to develop into something more.

By 1963, Baez had already released three albums, two of which had been certified gold, and she invited Dylan on stage to perform alongside her at the Newport Folk Festival. The two performed the Dylan composition "[[With God on Our Side (song)|With God on Our Side]]", a performance that set the stage for many more duets like it in the months and years to come. Typically while on tour, Baez would invite Dylan to sing on stage partly by himself and partly with her, much to the chagrin of her fans.&lt;ref name="American Masters" /&gt;

Before meeting Dylan, Baez's topical songs were very few: "[[Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream]]", "We Shall Overcome", and an assortment of [[Negro spirituals]]. Baez would later say that Dylan's songs seemed to update the topics of protest and justice.

By the time of Dylan's 1965 tour of the UK, their relationship had slowly begun to fizzle out after they had been romantically involved off and on for nearly two years. The tour and simultaneous disintegration of their relationship was documented in [[D. A. Pennebaker]]'s documentary film ''[[Dont Look Back]]''&lt;!-- {{sic}} --&gt; (1967).

Baez toured with Dylan as a performer on his [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] in 1975–76. She sang four songs with Dylan on the live album of the tour, ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue]]'', released in 2002. Baez appeared with Dylan in the one-hour TV special ''Hard Rain'', filmed at [[Fort Collins]], [[Colorado]], in May 1976. Baez also starred as 'The Woman in White' in the film ''[[Renaldo and Clara]]'' (1978), directed by Bob Dylan and filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue. Dylan and Baez toured together again in 1984 along with [[Carlos Santana]].

Baez discussed her relationship with Dylan in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s documentary film ''[[No Direction Home]]'' (2005), and in the PBS ''[[American Masters]]'' biography of Baez, ''How Sweet the Sound'' (2009).

Baez wrote and composed at least three songs that were specifically about Dylan. In "To Bobby", written in 1972, she urged Dylan to return to political activism, while in "[[Diamonds &amp; Rust (song)|Diamonds &amp; Rust]]", the title track from [[Diamonds &amp; Rust|her 1975 album]], she revisited her feelings for him in warm, yet direct terms.&lt;ref name = Gray&gt;{{cite book | last = Gray | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Gray (author) | title = The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia | publisher = The Continuum International Publishing Group | location = London | year = 2006 | pages = 30–31 | isbn = 0-8264-6933-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Winds of the Old Days (song)|Winds of the Old Days]]", also on the ''Diamonds &amp; Rust'' album, is a bittersweet reminiscence about her time with "Bobby".

The references to Baez in Dylan's songs are far less clear. Baez herself has suggested that she was the subject of both "[[Visions of Johanna]]" and "Mama, You Been on My Mind", although the latter was more likely about his relationship with [[Suze Rotolo]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray p 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Heylin&gt;{{cite book | last = Heylin | first = Clinton | title = Behind the Shades Revisited | publisher = HarperEntertainment | location = London | year = 2003 | pages = 158–159 | isbn = 0-06-052569-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baez implied when speaking about the connection to Diamonds and Rust that "Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts" is, at least in part, a metaphor for Dylan's view of his relationship with her. As for "Visions of Johanna", "She Belongs to Me", and other songs alleged to have been written about Baez, neither Dylan nor biographers such as [[Clinton Heylin]] and [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]] have had anything definitive to say, either way, regarding the subject of these songs.

===David Harris===
In October 1967, Baez and her mother, along with nearly 70 other women, were arrested at the Oakland, California, Armed Forces Induction Center for blocking its doorways to prevent entrance by young inductees, and in support of young men who refused [[conscription|military induction]]. They were incarcerated in the [[Santa Rita Jail]], and it was here that Baez met [[David Harris (protestor)|David Harris]], who was kept on the men's side but who still managed to visit with Baez regularly.

The two formed a close bond upon their release and Baez moved into his draft-resistance [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] in the hills above [[Stanford, California]]. The pair had known each other for three months when they decided to wed. After confirming the news to Associated Press, media outlets began dedicating ample press to the impending nuptials (at one point, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine referred to the event as the "Wedding of the Century").

After finding a [[pacifist]] preacher and a church outfitted with peace signs and writing a blend of [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] and [[Quaker wedding]] vows, Baez and Harris married in New York City on March 26, 1968. Her friend [[Judy Collins]] sang at the ceremony. After the wedding, Baez and Harris moved into a home in the Los Altos Hills on {{convert|10|acre|hectare}} of land called Struggle Mountain, part of a commune, where they tended gardens and were strict vegetarians.

A short time later, Harris refused induction into the armed forces and was indicted. On July 16, 1969, Harris was taken by federal marshals to prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901123,00.html | title = People: July 25, 1969 | publisher  =  (Paragraph 2) ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' | date =  July 25, 1969 | accessdate = June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- leaving Baez alone -- not alone at all, on that commune, according to the article. --&gt; Baez was visibly pregnant in public in the months that followed, most notably at the [[Woodstock]] Festival, where she performed a handful of songs in the early morning. The documentary film ''Carry It On'' was produced during this period, and was released in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newfilmco.com/CIOpage.htm "Carry It On"]. Directed by Chris Knight. The New Film Co., 1970.  Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; The film's behind-the-scenes looks at Harris's views and arrest and Baez on her subsequent performance tour was positively reviewed in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine and ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = J.

''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved June 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the songs Baez wrote about this period of her life are "A Song for David", "Myths", "Prison Trilogy (Billy Rose)" and "Fifteen Months" (the amount of time Harris was imprisoned).

Their son Gabriel was born on December 2, 1969. Harris was released from Texas prison after 15 months, but the relationship began to dissolve and the couple divorced amicably in 1973. They shared custody of Gabriel, who lived primarily with Baez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Joan Baez Sues for a Divorce | author=James F.

===Steve Jobs===
Baez dated [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] cofounder [[Steve Jobs]] during the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Manock, Jerry (June 1982). [http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Invasion_of_Texaco_Towers.txt "Invasion of Texaco Towers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110224/http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Invasion_of_Texaco_Towers.txt |date=March 4, 2016 }}. Folklore.org. "One afternoon, when the project was in its advanced stages, Steve burst through the door, unannounced, in an exuberant mood. He had two guests ... Joan Baez and her sister, Mimi Farina."&lt;/ref&gt; A number of sources have stated that Jobs—then in his mid-20s—had considered asking Baez to marry him, except that her age at the time (early 40s) made the possibility of their having children unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Young | first=Jeffrey S. | last2= Simon |first2=  William L. | year =2005 | title = Con Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business | publisher= Wiley | isbn = 0-471-72083-6 }} '''Vague- cite page'''.&lt;/ref&gt; Baez mentioned Jobs in the acknowledgments in her 1987 memoir ''And a Voice to Sing With'' and performed at the memorial for him in 2011. After Jobs' death, Baez spoke fondly about him, stating that even after the relationship had ended, the two remained friends, with Jobs having visited Baez shortly before his death, and stating that "Steve had a very sweet side, even if he was as ... erratic as he was famous for being".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contactmusic.com/news/joan-baez-pays-tribute-to-generous-steve-jobs_1281311 "Joan Baez Pays Tribute To Generous Steve Jobs"] Contactmusic.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joan Baez at the The Egg (Albany, NY), March 2016.jpg|thumbnail|Joan Baez at The Egg (Albany, NY), March 2016]]

===2000s–2010s===
Baez is a resident of [[Woodside, California]], where she lived with her mother until the latter's death.&lt;ref name="PAO2013" /&gt; She has revealed that her house has a backyard [[tree house]] in which she spends time meditating, writing, and "being close to nature".&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, John (March 8, 2002). [http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/20020308baez3.asp "Music Preview: Joan Baez says hard times are over"], ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''.&lt;/ref&gt; She remained close to her younger sister Mimi up until Mimi's death in 2001, and mentioned in the 2009 ''American Masters'' documentary about her life that she had grown closer to her older sister Pauline in later years.

==In popular culture==
* Cartoonist [[Al Capp]], creator of the [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'', satirized Baez as "Joanie Phoanie" during the 1960s. Joanie was an unabashed communist radical who sang songs of [[class conflict|class warfare]] while hypocritically traveling in a [[limousine]] and charging outrageous performance fees to impoverished orphans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843312,00.html "Comics: Which One Is the Phoanie?"]  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. January 20, 1967. Retrieved June 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Capp had this character singing bizarre songs such as "A Tale of Bagels and Bacon" and "Molotov Cocktails for Two". Although Baez was upset by the parody in 1966, she admits to being more amused in recent years. "I wish I could have laughed at this at the time", she wrote in a caption under one of the strips, reprinted in her autobiography. "Mr. Capp confused me considerably. I'm sorry he's not alive to read this, it would make him chuckle."&lt;ref&gt;UPI (January 11, 1967). [http://www.upi.com/topic/Al_Capp/ "Al Capp denies his character "Joanie Phoanie" looks like Joan Baez]. [[United Press International]]. Retrieved June 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Capp stated at the time: "Joanie Phoanie is a repulsive, egomaniacal, un-American, non-taxpaying horror, I see no resemblance to Joan Baez whatsoever, but if Miss Baez wants to prove it, let her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dM_enWzoghoC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=%22if+Miss+Baez+wants+to+prove+it%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22if%20Miss%20Baez%20wants%20to%20prove%20it%22&amp;f=false |title=Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America |first=Rick |last=Perlstein |page=212 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2010 |accessdate=November 3, 2013|isbn=9781451606263 }} Via Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Baez's serious persona was parodied several times on the American variety show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in impersonations by [[Nora Dunn]], notably in the 1986 mock game show ''Make Joan Baez Laugh''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/joan-baez-the-life-and-times-of-a-secret-badass-w474962|title=Joan Baez: The Life and Times of a Secret Badass|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=April 5, 2017|first= David|last=Browne|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2015/04/07/nora_dunn_snl_is_a_traumatic_experience_it%E2%80%99s_something_you_have_to_survive/|title=Nora Dunn: 'SNL is a traumatic experience.

}}'''Josephine Hale''' (May 27, 1878 - October 5, 1961)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.umt.edu/montanamuseum/documents/Josephine%20Hale%20Biography.pdf|title=Josephine Hale - In Country, Out of Country: The Life and Art of Josephine Hale|last=Reintjes|first=Brandon|date=November 13, 2009|website=www.umt.edu/montanamuseum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an early Montana painter and nurse in the Red Cross during [[World War I]]. She spent much of her adult life in [[Great Falls, Montana]], but traveled throughout France and the United States.

== Personal life ==
Josephine Hale was born in 1878 as Josephine Adeline Bruneau. The Bruneau family had eleven children, of which Hale was the youngest. Most of her siblings were born in Quebec however her family moved to the United States before Hale was born and settled near Sioux Point, South Dakota.  In 1896 Hale graduated from a high school in Sioux City, Iowa. Two years later, at the age of twenty, Hale moved to Great Falls, MT where three of her siblings already lived. She began teaching in Eden, ten miles away from Great Falls, after passing her teacher certification test. The Montana Museum of Art and Culture states that it is likely she taught at "Canyon Schoolhouse, in the Eden area."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/990066233|title=Intimate west : women artists in Montana : 1880-1944.|last=|first=|publisher=University of Montana Press and the Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture|others=Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture., University of Montana Press (Missoula, Mont.),, University of Montana Printing &amp; Graphic Services|year=|isbn=9780998343846|location=Missoula, Montana|pages=49–50|oclc=990066233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Great Falls, Josephine Hale met her husband, wealthy rancher Walter George Hale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1006511690|title=Over there! : Montanans in the great war.|last=Chacón|first=H. Rafael|publisher=Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture|others=Chacón, H. Rafael., Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture., University of Montana Press (Missoula, Mont.),, University of Montana Printing &amp; Graphic Services|year=|isbn=9780998343839|location=Missoula, Montana|pages=26–27|oclc=1006511690}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two married August 22, 1901 but the marriage lasted only three years. Walter Hale contracted and then died of tuberculosis. After her husband's death, Hale retained ownership of the ranch she had owned with him, and rented it to tenants as a source of income beginning in 1907. In 1910 Hale purchased a three-house lot in Great Falls which she used to board family members. She also created studio space in one of the attics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1917 Hale joined the Red Cross as a nurse to serve during WWI.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While living in France, Hale met George Hepburn Robertson and fell in love. George Hepburn Robertson served as the Director of Transportation for the American Red Cross, which is likely where they met. Although Hale never married Robertson it is likely that part of her reason for returning to France later in life was to continue the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She remained in France until 1926 when she returned to the US and began attending school for interior decoration. Hale returned to France less than a year later to continue her art education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1935 Hale moved back to Great Falls, MT where she lived during the Great Depression and WWII. During the ten years after her return from Europe she created a prolific amount of art work, she also continued nursing, a skill she had picked up in the Red Cross, for the rest of her life, including volunteering during WWII at Columbus Hospital.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Hale died in 1961 at the age of 83.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Red Cross ==
World War I began in 1914, and in 1917 Josephine Hale enlisted in the Red Cross. At the time the Red Cross had an age limit on enlistment, and the forty year old Hale lied about her age, stating she was thirty-five, in order to enlist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her ability to speak French was viewed as an asset and she paid for her own passage to Europe in order to ensure her acceptance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hale traveled from New York to London aboard a transport vessel named the Corinthia. For protection her ship was accompanied by a cruiser, U-boat destroyers, airplanes and hydroplanes. After she arrived in London, Hale took a train to Paris.

Hale's first assignment in France was in Paris at the Gara de l'Est canteen where she took medical classes and improved her language skills. After her training in Paris, Hale worked in canteens near the front, at Bordeaux. She would later open her own canteen in Marseilles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hale wrote in her diary about her experiences working with soldiers:&lt;blockquote&gt;"because of my knowledge of French I am assigned on the French and Belgian side. They are so different from our boys and so very polite but they are accustomed to being waited on so it is a bit harder on the waiter. They seem very much pleased to have an American to talk and joke with them and how they love to air every bit of English that they know. The Americans are all about the same age, but the others range from 55 to 18 -- grey haired men and fresh faced boys and everyone ready to smile back at you every chance they get. It seems they take this war as their work and it is here to do."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hale also recorded her experiences through at the front photography including images of damage caused by bombs at Fort de la Pompelle, a cathedral in ruins and the destruction of a forest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice]], Hale extended her visa in order to continue working in devastated areas. In October 1920 she received her nursing degree from the Societe Francaise de Secours in Paris and in 1924 she was awarded the ''[[Medal of French Gratitude|Médaille de la Reconnaissance française]]'' by the French government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Art ==
In early 1926 Hale moved to Boston and began attending courses at the New York School of Interior of Decoration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her professors recommended that she pursue painting as a degree program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By October 14, 1926 Hale returned to Paris in order to continue studying interior design but the next year she began attending the [[Académie Delécluse]], where she began her full-time study of painting and drawing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the academy she studied under Auguste Delécluse, Eugene Delécluse, De Courmon and Jean-Paul Laurens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Later, she would describe her time studying art in France as "the happiest years of my life."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following nine years improving her skills, Hale received accolades in the Salon of 1934 and was invited to galleries and arts organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hale produced paintings with a wide variety of subjects including still lifes, florals, landscapes, portraits and nudes. Stylistically she was influenced by her experience with interior design in her use of fabric and floral patterns, French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Fauves use of animated lines in landscapes, and the European tradition of plein air painting. She also consistently referenced the book ''The Art Spirit'' by Robert Henri in her sketchbooks. Hale built her body of work by travelling extensively including visits to French Brittany, Monaco, Italy, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Morocco, the Sonoran Desert and Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1995 Vivian Ellis and Fran Walton gifted the Josephine Hale art collection to the [[Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture|Montana Museum of Art and Culture]], which is the primary repository of her work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; MMAC exhibit "Intimate West: Women Artists in Montana 1880-1944." The goal of the exhibit was to show a different interpretation of the American West than the traditional representations by artists like C.M. Russel and Edgar S. Paxson. Hale's works in the exhibit include studies and images of Glacier National Park that are described as "long, thoughtful studies of the natural world" by MMAC curator Jeremy Camwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://missoulian.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/intimate-west-surveys-pioneering-female-artists-take-on-region/article_64ef0242-3f12-591c-aeef-6317a10fe247.html|title='Intimate West' surveys pioneering female artists' take on region|last=Walsh|first=Cory|date=January 20, 2017|work=missoulian.com|access-date=2018-03-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale was also the subject of an exhibit, "The Life and Art of Josephine Hale, 1878-1961," at the Hockaday Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hockadaymuseum.org/index.cfm?inc=page&amp;page=327|title=The Life and Art of Josephine Hale Exhibition at the Hockaday Museum of Art|website=www.hockadaymuseum.org|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lākhey''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: लाखे, lā-khé) (alternative spellings '''Lākhe''', '''Lākhay''', लाखय्) is a demon in Nepalese folklore. He is depicted with a ferocious face, protruding fangs and mane of red or black hair. Lakhes figure prominently in traditional [[Newar]] culture of [[Nepal Mandala]]. The Lakhe tradition is found in the [[Kathmandu Valley]] and other Newar settlements throughout [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Gurung| first = Anuj | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/nepal/demon-among-deities| title = A Demon Among Deities| work = Cultural Survival| publisher = | date=Spring 2009| accessdate = 23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakhes are said to be demons who used to live in the forests and later became protectors to the townspeople.&lt;ref&gt;Trussler, Simon and Barker, Clive (1 September 2003). ''New Theatre Quarterly 74, Volume 19.'' Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521535891}}, 9780521535892. Page 127.&lt;/ref&gt; A female Lakhe is known as Lasin (लसिं).

The other common legendary being in Nepalese folklore is the [[Khyah (legendary creature)|Khyāh]], who is depicted as a fat, hairy ape-like creature.

==Dancing Lakhes==

Lakhey Dance is one of the most popular dances of Nepal. Performers wearing a Lakhe costume and mask perform dances on the streets and city squares during festivals. The mask is made of [[papier-mâché]] and [[yak]] tails are used for the hair. The Lakhe dance is characterised by wild movements and thumping music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.sikkim-culture.gov.in/Dances/Trance%20Dances.aspx| title = Lakhey Mask Dance| work = | publisher = Cultural Affairs and Heritage Department, Government of Sikkim| date=| accessdate = 24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous Lakhe is [[Majipa Lakhey]] of [[Kathmandu]] who appears during the [[Yenya]] (Indra Jatra) festival in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Toffin| first = Gérard | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/64459961/Indra-Jatra-of-Kathmandu-Gerard-Toffin| title = The Indra Jātrā of Kathmandu as a Royal Festival Past and Present| work = Contributions to Nepalese Studies| publisher = Center for Nepal and Asian Studies, Tribhuvan University| date=January 1992| accessdate = 24 July 2012}} Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koizumi, Fumio (1983). ''Dance and music in South Asian drama: Chhau, Mahākālī pyākhan and Yakshagāna.'' Academia Music. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He is worshipped as a deity. City dwellers offer food and ritual items to him as he moves through the city accompanied by his musical band giving dance performances.

The Lakhe stops at major crossroads and market squares to give a performance. During the dance, a small boy is known as Jhyalincha (झ्यालिंचा) taunts the Lakhe making him chase him in anger. Jhyalincha always manages to slip into the crowd and escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bajracharya |first=Chunda |editor-first=Subash Ram |editor-last=Prajapati |title=The Masked Dances of Nepal Mandal|publisher=Thimi: Madhyapur Art Council|date=2006|chapter=Majipa Lakhe|isbn=99946-707-0-0}} Page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunla Lakhe comes out during [[Gunla]], the 10th month in the [[Nepal Sambat]] calendar which corresponds to August.

==Other Lakhes==

There are other Lakhes with particular characteristics. These mythical beings are said to reside in various parts of the city.

* Michyāh Lākhe (मिच्या: लाखे) (meaning "fire burning demon" in [[Nepal Bhasa]]) is a spirit who is said to cause a fire by [[spontaneous combustion]] wherever it resides. People possessed by Michyāh Lakhe are also believed to cause a fire. 
* Minpu Lākhe (मिंपू लाखे) also causes a fire.

==Synopsis==
Owen Suskind was a boy of considerable promise, until he's diagnosed with autism at the age of 3. As Owen withdrew into his silent state, his parents almost lost hope that he would find some way to meaningfully interact with his world. However, that way was found through animated films, especially ones by Walt Disney Pictures, which provided Owen a way to understand the world through its stories to the point of creating his own and grew obsessed with despite also owning some non-Disney movies, too. This film covers the life of Owen and how he manages to become as functional as possible with the help of Disney and his family to the point of having his own life. However, Owen soon learns as well that there is more to real life than what Disney can illustrate in animation even as his family prepares itself for an uncertain future with him. He gains and loses Emily who was his girlfriend because he got into her personal space according to her.

''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s critic Lanre Bakare praised the film and said, "It's a beguiling mix of animated storytelling and narration that doesn't flinch from exploring the emotional highs and lows that accompany a life with autism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life, Animated review – how Disney films helped a boy with autism|url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/29/life-animated-review-how-disney-films-helped-a-boy-with-autism|last=Bakare |first=Lanre|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=January 29, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Turan]] of ''[[LA Times]]'' lauded the film and said, "[Williams] spent two years on this project, and the trust everyone involved placed in him allowed for an emotional honesty that is ''Life, Animated''{{'}}s greatest strength."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Life, Animated' follows an autistic boy's astonishing journey back to the world with the help of Disney movies|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-life-animated-review-20160627-snap-story.html|last=Turan|first=Kenneth |publisher=''LA Times''|date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Justin Chang wrote, "This latest film from [[Roger Ross Williams]] ("God Loves Uganda") teems with insights into how children's fantasy can and can't bridge a developmental gap, but works on an even more basic, emotional level as a warm testament to a family's love and resilience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Review: 'Life, Animated'|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/life-animated-review-1201699114/|last=Chang|first=Justin|publisher=''Variety''|date=February 6, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Duane Byrge called it "a documentary gem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Life, Animated': Sundance Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/life-animated-sundance-review-859879|last=Byrge|first=Duane|publisher=''The Hollywood Reporter''|date=January 27, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Hornaday of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' positively reviewed the series and said, "''Life, Animated'' makes fascinating points, about the power of cinema, about meeting our loved ones where they are and, as Ron says, about who gets to decide what constitutes a meaningful life"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Life, Animated': A young man's obsession with Disney helps him navigate autism |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/life-animated-a-young-mans-obsession-with-disney-helps-him-navigate-autism/2016/07/07/7852a6c4-3e0d-11e6-80bc-d06711fd2125_story.html |last=Hornaday|first=Ann|publisher=''The Washington Post''|date=July 7, 2016| accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s chief film critic [[Peter Travers]] said, "In no way does Owen's story claim to be a cure-all. Instead of false hope, it offers up possibility, the chance of a stimulus that might get past the blocks of developmental disorder. That's more than encouraging. Life, Animated is truly inspirational."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life, Animated A young autistic man connects to the world through Disney movies in this inspiring doc|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/life-animated-20160628|last=Travers|first=Peter|publisher= ''The Rolling Stone''|date=Jul 1, 2016| accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Noel Murray said, "On the list of Disney-related 2016 releases about child-rearing and handicaps, this one goes just above "Finding Dory." What it lacks in wacky hijinks, it makes up in hard truths."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A love of Disney helps an autistic adult understand the world in Life, Animated|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/love-disney-helps-autistic-adult-understand-world--238829| last=Murray |first =Noel |publisher=''The A.V. Club''|date=June 29, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing for ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'' film critic Sheila O'Malley wrote, "Powerful and emotional, without being manipulative. It is deeply inspiring, without trying to be. It is honest about Owen's struggles, and the struggles of his family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life, Animated, Review|url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/life-animated-2016| last= O'Malley |first=Sheila|publisher=''RogerEbert.com''|date=Jul 1, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s, Joe McGovern also lauded the series saying, "The Suskinds' humongous hearts are obviously in the right place and their openness is to be admired and encouraged - even if a book, more than a movie, remains the better venue to fairly and honestly tell Owen's extraordinary story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life, Animated, EW Review |url=http://ew.com/article/2016/06/30/life-animated-ew-review/|last=McGovern|first=Joe |publisher=''Entertainment Weekly''|date=June 30, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle Smith of ''[[New York Post]]'' explained, "''Life, Animated'' oversimplifies the situation, contriving to use endless clips from Disney movies to make a case that movie magic really can better people's lives. Unfortunately, by the end of the movie it's clear that Disney can't help Owen negotiate sex, breakups or many other challenges he faces as an adult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disney helps an autistic boy navigate life in this new doc|url=https://nypost.com/2016/06/30/disney-helps-an-autistic-boy-navigate-life-in-this-new-doc/|last=Smith|first=Kyle|publisher=''New York Post''|date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some publications however were more critical towards the film. In a lukewarm review of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' David Parkinson wrote, "A touch twee at times, but the use of classic and original animation is admirable, while Owen emerges as the king of sidekicks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life, Animated Empie Review|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/life-animated/review/|last=Parkinson|first=David|publisher=''Empire'' |date=December 12, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Anthony Lane]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said, "Owen has made immense progress, to which Life, Animated is a stirring tribute, yet it leaves a trail of questions unanswered or unasked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Cafe Society" and "Life, Animated" Reviews|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/11/cafe-society-and-life-animated-reviews|last=Lane|first=Anthony|publisher=''The New Yorker'' |date=July 4, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}}s Jeannette Catsoulis quipped, "Belaboring the cartoon connection, the director leaves the family struggles that enrich Mr. Suskind's 2014 book of the same title stubbornly veiled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: In 'Life, Animated,' a Bound Mind Finds Freedom|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/movies/review-life-animated.html|last=Catsoulis |first=Jeannette |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a less enthusiastic review for ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' Clayton Dillard stated, "It never addresses Disney's wholly manufactured stranglehold on turning adolescent desire into a consumerist impulse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Review: Life, Animated |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/life-animated|last=Clayton|first=Dillard|publisher=''Slant Magazine'' |date=June 27, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land of the Lost Sidekicks==
An exclusive short, based on Owen's [[fan fic]] featuring younger version of himself and his favorite Disney sidekicks battling against the evil Fuzzbutch, was released on The Wrap in 2016.&lt;ref name="thewrap.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/watch-life-animated-short-land-of-the-lost-sidekicks-exclusive/|title=Watch 'Life, Animated's' Original Short, 'Land of the Lost Sidekicks' (Exclusive Video)|date=14 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of the fastest-selling albums in '''South Korea'''.

''Love Yourself: Answer'' by BTS is the current fastest-selling album in South Korea with over 1.9 million copies shipped to stores in its first 8 days of release.

===Hanteo===
This the list of the highest weekly album sales in South Korea, as recorded by the Hanteo Information System established in 1993.&lt;div&gt;
Hanteo releases album sales on a daily basis, but does not cover all retailers.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}  However, Hanteo coverage has increased over the past decade.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Furthermore, album sales have become increasingly frontloaded over time, hence why million-sellers from the mid and late 1990's do not appear on this list.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The '''Michigan Womyn's Music Festival''', often referred to as '''MWMF''' or '''Michfest''', and called the "Original Womyn's Woodstock",&lt;ref&gt;Edwalds, Loraine; Stocker, Midge (eds.) ''The Woman-Centered Economy: Ideals, Reality, and the Space in Between'', Third Side Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; was an international [[Feminism|feminist]] [[music festival]] held every August from 1976 to 2015 in [[Oceana County, Michigan]], USA, near [[Hart Township, Michigan|Hart Township]], in a small wooded area referred to as "The Land" by MichFest organizers and attendees.&lt;ref name=loveletter /&gt; The event was completely built, staffed, run and attended by women. Attendees described attending the event as a powerful and unique experience for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odahl-Ruan|first1=Charlynn|last2=McConnell|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Shattell|first3=Mona|last4=Kozlowski|first4=Christine|date=June 15, 2015|title=Empowering Women through Alternative Settings: Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival|url=https://www.gjcpp.org/en/article.php?issue=19&amp;article=105|journal=Global Journal of Community Psychology Practice|volume=6|issue=1|issn=2163-8667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministcurrent.com/2016/08/05/women-grieve-michfest-look-forward-new-gatherings/|title=Women grieve the loss of Michfest online, look forward to new gatherings|last1=Cox|first1=Susan|date=August 5, 2016|website=Feminist Current|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Radical feminism sidebar|expanded=Actions and ideas}}

===Background===
America's first "[[women's music]] festivals" began appearing in the early 1970s, starting with day festivals at the [[California State University, Sacramento|Sacramento State]] and [[San Diego State University]] campuses, the Midwest Women's Festival held in Missouri, the Boston Women's Music Festival, and the National Women's Music Festival at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]. These first regional women-only events exposed audiences to feminist and [[Coming out|openly lesbian]] artists, most of whom operated independently of the mainstream recording industry. Festival gatherings offered an alternative to urban bars, coffeehouses and protest marches, which were some of the few opportunities for lesbians to meet one another in the early 1970s.  The [[separatist feminism|feminist separatism]] of the spaces was a direct outgrowth of and solidarity with the activism created by black power and other racial solidarity movements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ariel Levy (journalist)|Levy, Ariel]]. [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/03/02/090302fa_fact_levy "Lesbian Nation"], ''The New Yorker'', March 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 "Letter to the Community", Michfest founder and organizer Lisa Vogel explained MWMF's [[womyn-born womyn]] intention as a [[women-only space]]: "The Festival, for a single precious week, is intended for womyn who at birth were deemed female, who were raised as girls, and who identify as womyn. I believe that womyn-born womyn (WBW) is a lived experience that constitutes its own distinct gender identity."&lt;ref name="Vogel_letter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vogel|first1=Lisa|title=Letter to the Community|url=http://michfest.com/letter-to-the-community-4_11_13/|website=Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|date=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation and early years===
As a private, women-only camping event, the Michigan festival was founded in 1976 by 19-year-old Lisa Vogel, who, with sister Kristie Vogel and friend Mary Kindig, planned an event along the lines of the recent Boston Women's Music Festival and the Midwest Women's Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenfield|first=Beth|title=Intense, Unique No-Man's Lands|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/26/travel/26ahead.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
In 1982, the Festival, then in its seventh year, moved to its long-term 650-acre location near Hart, Michigan, attracting the largest audience hitherto (upwards of 8,000 campers). Gradually, it added an acoustic stage (and an August night [[open mic]] stage) in addition to day stage and night stage programming. After much discussion, cement-paved walkways were added to ease access for women with mobility challenges and [[Baby transport|baby strollers]]. Barbara "Boo" Price became Lisa Vogel's business partner after the 1985 festival and was increasingly involved with production until the two parted ways in 1994.  The 1980s saw many unique challenges, including the production of a 10th anniversary double album in 1985, the growth of the gathering to five days (with new intensive workshops) by 1986, the extraordinary thunderstorms of the "Harmonic Convergence" year in 1987, and an outbreak of [[shigella]] in 1988 (the swift handling of which was praised by both local and national health inspectors).&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19880820&amp;id=cm8fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=034EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6037,3712374 "Health Agencies In State Warned of Diarrhea Outbreak"], Milwaukee Journal, August 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 2006648 | volume=133 | title=An outbreak of shigellosis at an outdoor music festival | journal=Am J Epidemiol | pages=608–15 | last1 = Lee | first1 = LA | last2 = Ostroff | first2 = SM | last3 = McGee | first3 = HB | last4 = Johnson | first4 = DR | last5 = Downes | first5 = FP | last6 = Cameron | first6 = DN | last7 = Bean | first7 = NH | last8 = Griffin | first8 = PM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
During the 1990s the Festival updated structurally and musically to expand styles of stage performance for a new generation of performers, adding a runway to the Night Stage, a [[Moshing|mosh pit]], and acts including the [[Indigo Girls]] and [[Tribe 8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scauzillo|first=Retts|title=Retts Returns to the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|url=http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbiantravels/a/RettsatMichigan.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=February 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206020219/http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbiantravels/a/RettsatMichigan.htm|archive-date=February 6, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing from a personal perspective for the ''Village Voice'' in fall 1994, artist and Festival kitchen worker Gretchen Phillips said: "I had never seen so many breasts before, so many bare asses, so much damn skin on such a vast terrain. I decided to make that weekend all about studying my body issues" and "I've always used Mich as a place to charge my batteries for the rest of the year, planning my life around being there in August and learning my lessons, both fun and hard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Gretchen|authorlink=Gretchen Phillips|title=I Moshed at Mich|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=The Village Voice|date=September 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playwright [[Carolyn Gage]] later said: "At Michfest, she can experience a degree of safety that is not available to any woman any time anywhere except at the festival. And what does that mean? It means she achieves a level of relaxation, physical, psychic, cellular, that she had never experienced before. She is free, sisters. She is free. Often for the first time in her life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cage|first=Carolyn|title=Hotter Than Hell: The 2011 Lesbian Tent Revival|year=2011|url=http://carolyngage.weebly.com/hotter-than-hell.html|pages=140–41|quote=At Michfest, she can experience a degree of safety that is not available to any woman any time anywhere except at the Festival. And what does that mean? It means she achieves a level of relaxation, physical, psychic, cellular, that she had never experienced before. She is free, sisters. She is free. Often for the first time in her life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, author and feminist scholar [[Bonnie Morris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womensstudies.berkeley.edu/about/department-faculty/bonnie-morris/|title=Bonnie Morris|date=2018|website=Gender &amp; Women's Studies|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; described it as "An entire city run by and for lesbian feminists. Utopia revealed. And Eden—built by Eves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eden Built By Eves:  The Culture of Women's Music Festivals|last=Morris|first=Bonnie J|publisher=[[Alyson Publications]]|year=1999|isbn=1-55583-477-9|edition=1st|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Final Festival ===
MichFest celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2015. On April 21, Lisa Vogel announced via ''[[Facebook]]'' that it would also be the last festival.&lt;ref name=dearsisters /&gt; An  opinion published in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' by a festivalgoer speculated that the ongoing controversy regarding trans women was to blame.&lt;ref name=Minshal&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson-Minshal|first1=Diane|title=Op-ed: Michfest's Founder Chose to Shut Down Rather Than Change With the Times|url=https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2015/04/24/op-ed-michfests-founder-chose-shut-down-rather-change-times|website=The Advocate|date=April 24, 2015|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vogel wrote in her statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt; There have been struggles; there is no doubt about that. This is part of our truth, but it is not--and never has been--our defining story. The Festival has been the crucible for nearly every critical cultural and political issue the lesbian feminist community has grappled with for four decades. Those struggles have been a beautiful part of our collective strength; they have never been a weakness.&lt;ref name=dearsisters /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Attendance at the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival ranged from 3,000 to 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Core|first=Lindsay|title=How the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival's Topless Womyn Changed My Lesbian Life Forever|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/how-the-michigan-womyns-music-festivals-topless-womyn-changed-my-lesbian-life-forever/|newspaper=Autostraddle|date=August 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women build all of the stages, run the lighting and [[sound reinforcement system|sound systems]], make the trash collection rounds, serve as electricians, mechanics, security, medical and psychological support, cook meals for thousands over open fire pits, provide childcare, and facilitate workshops covering various topics of interest to the attendees, who are referred to as "festies". Hundreds of women spent upwards of a month out on the land building the festival from the ground up because it was torn down after each event ended, leaving the land as close to how it was found as possible.&lt;ref name="curvemag1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Messman-Rucker |first=Ariel |url=http://www.curvemag.com/Curve-Magazine/Web-Articles-2008/Welcome-Home-to-the-Michigan-Womyns-Festival/ |title=Welcome Home to the Michigan Womyns Festival |publisher=Curve |date= |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community decisions were made through worker community meetings where the youngest members of the community were given as much access to participate as the oldest. Community service support included ASL translation at every performance, mental and physical health care, AA meetings, camping for disabled women, as well as a tent solely for women of color.  While men were not allowed at the Festival, male children age 4 and under were allowed within the festival. Childcare for girls and boys aged 5 and under is provided by Sprouts, and for 5 and over girls the main venue is "Gaia Girls". There is also teen circle.  Brother Sun Boys Camp was available for boys aged 5 to 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McMahon |first=Becky |url=http://www.gaypeopleschronicle.com/stories05/august/0819051.htm |title=Michigan festival, in its 30th year, is like a reunion |publisher=Gay People's Chronicle |date=August 19, 2005 |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and performances==
The Festival created a space for performers of all genres to share their music. While many artists had earned mainstream success after their performance at the festival, the Festival supported diverse performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2267197, Goldin-Perschbacher, Shana. “Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival."] The Grove Dictionary of American Music (2014).

==Controversy about transgender people==
Controversy over the Festival's determination to remain a space for [[cisgender]] [[females]] led to protests by trans women and their allies, and a boycott of the Festival by Equality Michigan in 2014.&lt;ref name=boycott /&gt; The boycott was joined by the Human Rights Campaign ("HRC"),&lt;ref name=HRC /&gt; the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ("GLAAD"),&lt;ref name=GLAAD /&gt; the National Center for Lesbian Rights ("NCLR"), and the National LGBTQ Task Force ("The Task Force").

In response to the anti-Festival petition, the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival stated:  "MWMF is not just a party. It is a space wherein females—who have been subjected to all manner of degradation from the moment of their first breath—can unpack and put down the oppressions that are directly tied to that experience under patriarchy...Equality Michigan has initiated a petition and call to action against the Festival based on misrepresentations, purposeful omissions, and selective editing of prior Festival statements on this issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vogel|first1=Lisa|title=Michfest Response to Equality Michigan’s Call For Boycott|url=http://michfest.com/statement-from-michigan-womyns-music-festival-8_1_4/|website=Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|date=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Vogel referred to the boycott as "[[McCarthyism|McCarthy-era]] blacklist tactics".&lt;ref name="betweenthelines"&gt;{{cite web|author=BTL Staff|title=Michfest Responds: We Have a Few Demands Of Our Own|url=http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=67561|website=Pride Source|publisher=[[Between the Lines (newspaper)|Between The Lines]]|date=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michfest supporters responded to the shunning with social media posts, letters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Bonnie J.|title=Letter to GLAAD|url=http://www.michfestmatters.com/letter-to-glaad-by-bonnie-j-morris-ph-d/|dead-url=yes|publisher=Voices From The Land|date=September 12, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022032643/http://www.michfestmatters.com/letter-to-glaad-by-bonnie-j-morris-ph-d/|archivedate=October 22, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and online media presentations such as "Myths and The Truth About the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival".&lt;ref name="mythsandtruth"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myths and The Truth About the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|url=http://www.thetruthaboutthemichiganfestival.com|website=thetruthaboutthemichiganfestival.com|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCLR and The Task Force withdrew their support of the boycott,&lt;ref name="windycity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/NCLRs-Kate-Kendell-removes-Michfest-boycott-signature/51126.html|title=NCLR and Task Force remove names from Michfest petition|last1=Toce|first1=Sarah|date=April 9, 2015|website=[[Windy City Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Equality Michigan's executive director resigned from the organization.&lt;ref name="gendertrender"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gendertrender.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/creator-of-michfest-boycott-emily-dievendorf-resigns-as-executive-director-of-equality-michigan/|title=Creator of Michfest Boycott Emily Dievendorf Resigns as Executive Director of Equality Michigan|last1=GallusMag|date=April 14, 2015|website=GenderTrender}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The womyn-born-womyn intention first came to attention in 1991 after a [[transsexual]] festival-goer, Nancy Burkholder, was asked to leave the festival when several women recognized her as a trans woman and expressed discomfort with her presence in the space.&lt;ref name="transadvocate"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Cristan|title=Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival|url=http://transadvocate.com/michigan-womyns-music-festival_n_8943.htm|website=The TransAdvocate|date=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mythsandtruth" /&gt; In August 2014, Lisa Vogel apologized for this incident, stating:

{{quote|Over 20 years ago, we asked Nancy Burkholder, a trans womon, to leave the Land. That was wrong, and for that, we are sorry. We, alongside the rest of the LGBTQ community, have learned and changed a great deal over our 39‐year history. We speak to you now in 2014 after two decades of evolution; an evolution grown from our willingness to stay in hard conversations, just as we do every year around issues of race, ability, class and gender. Since that single incident, Festival organizers have never asked a trans womon to leave the Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Have a Few Demands of our Own: Michfest Response to NCLR and HRC endorsing EQM petition to boycott|url=http://michfest.com/we-have-a-few-demands-of-our-own-michfest-response-to-nclr-and-hrc-endorsing-eqm-petition-to-boycott-‐-81814/|website=Michfest (Michigan Womyn's Music Festival)|date=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 2005 interview with [[Amy Ray]], Vogel discussed the intention within its informing political framework and stated: "I feel very strongly that having a space for women, who are born women, to come together for a week, is a healthy, whole, loving space to provide for women who have that experience. To label that as [[transphobia|transphobic]] is, to me, as misplaced as saying the women-of-color tent is racist, or to say that a transsexual-only space, a gathering of folks of women who are born men is misogynist. I have always in my heart believed in the politics and the culture of separate time and space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Correspondence: 2005-06-13: Amy - Michigan Womyn's Fest Interviews: Interview #3|url=http://www.indigogirls.com/correspondence/2005/2005-06-13-a/interview03.html|website=Indigo Girls|date=June 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319145443/http://www.indigogirls.com/correspondence/2005/2005-06-13-a/interview03.html|archivedate=March 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Burkholder incident, a protest movement against the womyn-born-womyn intention was organized. Opponents contended that it constituted [[discrimination]] against transsexual and [[transgender]] people, many of whom identified as women and were legally female. In 1994, a protest camp was created across the road from the Festival called [[Camp Trans]]&lt;ref name="straight"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Press Release|title=Michigan Womyn's Music Festival Sets the Record "Straight"|url=http://eminism.org/michigan/20060822-mwmf.txt|website=Eminism.org|date=August 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and later, "Son of Camp Trans").&lt;ref name="mythsandtruth" /&gt; In 2006, a trans woman and Camp Trans organizer named Lorraine was sold a ticket at the box office.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Supporters of trans women inclusion then issued a press release declaring, incorrectly, that the womyn-born-womyn objective was no longer in effect.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In response, Lisa Vogel reiterated the Festival's adherence to the intention, and also confronted the distribution of misinformation and accusations of [[transphobia]] by Camp Trans, in an August 2006 press release:

{{Quote|"From its inception the Festival has been home to womyn who could be considered gender outlaws, either because of their sexual orientation (lesbian, bisexual, polyamorous, etc.) or their gender presentation (butch, bearded, androgynous, femme - and everything in between). Many womyn producing and attending the Michigan Festival are gender variant womyn...We strongly assert there is nothing transphobic with choosing to spend one week with womyn who were born as, and have lived their lives as, womyn...Supporting womyn-born womyn space is no more inherently transphobic than supporting womyn of color space is racist."&lt;ref name="straight" /&gt;}}

The Michigan Womyn's Music Festival staunchly defended its raison d'être, described by Vogel as "a predominantly lesbian community...defined by lesbian culture" with "a focus on the experience of those born female, who've lived their lives subjected to oppression based on the sole fact of their being female."&lt;ref name="betweenthelines" /&gt; In her statement, Vogel added that "it is not the inclusion of trans women at Festival that we resist; it is the erasure of the specificity of female experience."&lt;ref name="betweenthelines" /&gt;

The protests against womyn-born womyn spaces resulted in some artists who had been invited to and/or performed at the Festival losing contracts or forced to cancel appearances because of their support, or their appearance of support, for the festival's intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill-Meyer|first1=Tobi|title=Bitch Pulled From Festival Lineup|url=http://bilerico.lgbtqnation.com/2010/05/bitch_pulled_from_festival_lineup.php|website=The Bilerico Project|publisher=LGBTQ Nation|date=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other performers were physically threatened by pro-inclusion supporters, faced verbal harassment and bomb threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Response to the violence against the Butchies and Le Tigre|url=http://eminism.org/michigan/20011007-carns.txt|website=Eminism.org|date=October 7, 2001|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, filmmaker Sara St. Martin Lynne was asked to resign from the board of the Bay Area Girls Rock Camp for attending the festival (the organization's Festival-related team had raised funds for BAGRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=St. Martin Lynne|first1=Sara|title=Letter of Resignation from the Board of Bay Area Girls Rock Camp|url=http://fishwithoutabicycle.com/2013/10/16/letter-of-resignation-from-the-board-of-bay-area-girls-rock-camp|website=Fish Without a Bicycle|date=October 16, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024010809/http://fishwithoutabicycle.com/2013/10/16/letter-of-resignation-from-the-board-of-bay-area-girls-rock-camp|archivedate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to an April 2013 [[Change.org]] petition by trans activist Red Durkin asking performers to boycott MWMF until trans women were included,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heated debate follows Michigan Fest boycott petition|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Heated-debate-follows-Michigan-Fest-boycott-petition/42349.html|website=[[Windy City Times]]|date=April 12, 2013|accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Vogel released a statement reaffirming the Festival's viewpoint:

{{Quote|"I reject the assertion that creating a time and place for WBW to gather is inherently transphobic. This is a false dichotomy and one that prevents progress and understanding. I believe in the integrity of autonomous space used to gather and celebrate for any group, whether that autonomous space is defined by age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, gender, class or any other identity. Whatever spaces we carve out in our community to encourage healing and rejuvenation should be accepted, and we should support each other in this endeavor. Nobody should be asked to erase the need for autonomous spaces to demonstrate that they are sisters in struggle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vogel|first1=Lisa|title=Letter to the Community|url=http://www.curvemag.com/Curve-Magazine/Web-Articles-2013/Letter-to-the-Community/|website=[[Curve (magazine)|Curve]]|date=April 11, 2013|accessdate=April 27, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924233052/http://www.curvemag.com/Curve-Magazine/Web-Articles-2013/Letter-to-the-Community/|archivedate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Michfest Half-Way Soirée==
For years, women created small gatherings outside of the festival and August in their own local communities, consisting mostly of small house parties and potlucks. After attending a festival in August 2004 and a pre-fest potluck, festie and entrepreneur, Lisa A. Snyder, was inspired to take the gatherings to the next level by creating a party that highlighted pieces of the festival in the middle of New York City. In 2005, she created the very first "Michfest Half-Way Soirée", a party that supported the local Michigan Womyn's Music Festival community, female musicians, and women-owned businesses. The worker community and festie community were encouraged to co-mingle and introduce new "festie virgins" to feel a slice of the festival energy, halfway to August. The benefit, the first of its kind (started by Snyder in [[New York City]]) also created buzz about the festival, appearing several times in ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' New York &lt;ref name="Own This City - Life in New York"&gt;{{cite web|last=London|first=Syd|title=We were there: Michigan Womyn's Music Festival Benefit|url=http://newyork.timeout.com/things-to-do/own-this-city-blog/86336/we-were-there-michigan-womyns-music-festival-benefit|publisher=Time Out New York|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and most recently in the February 2011 issue of ''[[GO (American magazine)|GO]]'' in "The Very Best of New York City Music" section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schroeder|first=Stephanie|title=The Very Best of NYC Music|journal=Go Magazine|date=February 2011|issue=February 2011 Issue|url=http://www.gomag.com/article/the_very_best_of_nyc_musi20/|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, additional locations for the Half-Way to Michfest Parties (sometimes also called Mid-Way Parties or Michfest Half-Way Parties) have begun to pop up across the United States. Known locations include [[Chicago]]; [[San Francisco Bay Area]]; [[Portland, Oregon]]; [[Boston]]; [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]; [[Santa Cruz, California]]; [[Syracuse, New York]]; [[Long Beach, California]]; [[Western Massachusetts]]; [[Tampa, Florida]]; [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]] and [[Bellingham, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=V|first=Kingsley|title=Half Way to Michfest Parties|url=http://www.alotoflife.com/Vs_Version_Blog/Entries/2009/1/26_Half_Way_to_Michfest_Parties.html|accessdate=10 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226163352/http://www.alotoflife.com/Vs_Version_Blog/Entries/2009/1/26_Half_Way_to_Michfest_Parties.html|archive-date=26 December 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''open-core model''' is a [[business model]] for the [[monetization]] of commercially-produced [[open-source software]]. Coined by Andrew Lampitt in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phipps|first1=Simon|title=Open Source Strategies for the Enterprise|date=July 2012|publisher=O'Reilly Media|isbn=978-1-4493-4117-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the open-core model primarily involves offering a "core" or [[crippleware|feature-limited]] version of a software product as [[free and open-source software]], while offering "commercial" versions or add-ons as [[proprietary software]].&lt;ref name="Riehle"&gt;{{cite conference

==Controversy==
The concept of open-core software has proven to be controversial, as many developers do not consider the business model to be true open-source software. Despite this, open-core models are used by a large number of open-source software companies.&lt;ref name=li-opencore&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Core Debate: The Battle for a Business Model|url=http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/66807.html|publisher=Linux Insider|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of contributor license agreements==
Some open-core products require their contributors to sign a [[contributor license agreement]], which either dictates that the copyright of all contributions to the product [[Work for hire|become the property of its owner]], or that the product's owner is given an unlimited, non-exclusive license to use the contributions, but the authors retain copyright ownership. In an open-core scenario, these agreements are typically meant to allow the commercial owner of the product (which in some cases, is ultimately the copyright holder to all of its code, regardless of its original author) to simultaneously market versions of the product under open-source and non-free licenses. This is in contrast with more traditional uses of CLAs, which are meant solely to allow the steward of an open-source project to defend its copyright, or guarantee that the code will only ever be made available under open-source terms, thus protecting it from becoming open core.&lt;ref name=infoworld-mysqlmistake&gt;{{cite web|title=MySQL mistake is a wake-up call on open source ownership|url=http://www.javaworld.com/article/2078812/open-source-tools/mysql-mistake-is-a-wake-up-call-on-open-source-ownership.html|website=InfoWorld|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ev.kde.org/announcements/2008-08-22-fsfe-welcomes-fla.php | date = 2008-08-22 | title = FSFE welcomes KDE's adoption of the Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Copyright-Papers.html | title = 6.1 Copyright Papers | accessdate = 2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Partisan Ballad''''' is a painting by Belarusian artist [[Mai Dantsig]] showing a [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] woman breastfeeding a weary partisan man during [[World War II]]. Both are equipped with rifles and [[ammunition belt]]s. Dantsig borrowed the [[Roman Charity]] theme, having seen the eponymous painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] in the [[Hermitage Museum]].&lt;ref name="lg"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.lgz.ru/article/N18--6222---2009-04-29-/May-DANTsIG%3A-Iskusstvo-dolzhno-b%D1%8Bty-aktivn%D1%8Bm8702/|title=Май Данциг: Искусство должно быть активным|work=[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]]| language=Russian| accessdate =10 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Partisan Ballad'' alludes to the German occupation of the Soviet Union on the [[Eastern Front of World War II]] when [[Belarusian SSR]] became the haven of [[Soviet partisans]].

The ''Partisan Ballad'' was at one time removed from the exhibition in the [[Minsk]] Palace of Arts when the local Soviet exhibition committee viewed the painting as an "[[incest]]".&lt;ref name="lg"/&gt; Dantsig subsequently kept the painting in his workshop before exhibiting it again in the [[Central House of Artists]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="lg"/&gt; In 2015, ''Partisan Ballad'' was exhibited in the [[Saatchi Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/painting-and-drawing/art520935-ten-artists-exploring-the-legacy-of-world-war-two-in-russian-art|title=Ten artists exploring the legacy of World War Two in Russian Art|publisher=[[Culture24]]| author=Richard Moss|date=17 March 2015| accessdate =10 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These winners were not required to paint scenes from Asia, which they had usually not visited prior to winning the prize. For example, [[Henri Dabadie]], having travelled at his own expenses in Algeria, without having won the coveted Prix Abd-el-Tif for a residence at the [[Villa Abd-el-Tif]], entered a painting of the Bay of Tunis into competition at the Salon de la Société coloniale des Artistes français in 1928, which won him the Prix de l'Indochine, including free passage to Indochina, and a period of employment at EBAI in Hanoi.&lt;ref name=Indochine&gt;André-Pallois, Nadine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7435">'''Psychoanalytic film theory''' is a school of academic thought that evokes of the concepts of psychoanalysts [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]]. The theory is closely tied to [[Critical theory]], [[Marxist film theory]], and [[Apparatus theory]]. 
The theory is separated into two waves. The First wave occurred in the 1960s and 70s. The second wave became popular in the 1980s and 90s.{{sfn|McGowan|2011}}

==Precursors==
At the end of the nineteenth century, psychoanalysis was created, and film happened to follow shortly afterward.{{sfn|Creed|1998|pp=1}} [[André Breton]], the founder of the [[Surrealist]] movement, saw film as a means of engaging the unconscious. Since films had the ability to tell a story using techniques such as superimposition, and slow motion, the Surrealists saw this as mimicking dreams.{{sfn|Creed|1998|pp=2}}

Early applications of psychoanalysis to cinema concentrated on unmasking latent meanings behind screen images, before moving on to a consideration of film as a representation of [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]].{{sfn|Lapsley and Westlake|1988|pp=67 and 91}} From there, a wider consideration of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject position]] of the viewer led to wider engagements with critical theory - to psychoanalytic film theory proper.{{sfn|Lapsley and Westlake|1988|pp=92-95}}

Freud's concepts of the Oedipus complex, narcissism, castration, the unconscious, the return, and hysteria are all utilized in film theory.{{sfn|Creed|1998|pp=2}}
The 'unconscious' of a film are examined; this is known as [[subtext]].{{sfn|Creed|1998|pp=2-3}}

==Gaze==

In the early 1970s, [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]] and [[Laura Mulvey]] separately explored aspects of the "[[gaze]]" in the cinema, Metz stressing the viewer's [[Identification (psychology)|identification]] with the camera's vision,&lt;ref&gt;Lapsley, p. 82-4&lt;/ref&gt; - an identification largely "constructed" by the film itself&lt;ref&gt;Childers, p. 173-4&lt;/ref&gt; - and Mulvey the [[Sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] aspects of (especially) the male viewer's regard for the onscreen female body.&lt;ref&gt;Lapsley, p. 77-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The viewing subject may be offered particular identifications (usually with a leading male character) from which to watch. The theory stresses the subject's longing for a completeness which the film may appear to offer through identification with an image, although Lacanian theory also indicates that identification with the image is never anything but an illusion and the subject is always split simply by virtue of coming into existence ([[aphanisis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (1994) p. 207-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second wave==

A second wave of psychoanalytic film criticism associated with [[Jacqueline Rose]] emphasised the search for the missing [[Objet petit a|object of desire]] on the part of the spectator: in [[Elisabeth Cowie]]'s words, "the pleasure of fantasy lies in the setting out, not in the having of the objects".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lapsley, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1990 onward the Matrixial theory of artist and  psychoanalyst [[Bracha L. Ettinger]]&lt;ref&gt; Bracha L. Ettinger, ''The Matrixial Borderspace'', University of Minnesota Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; revolutionized feminist film theory. Her concept [[The Matrixial Gaze]],&lt;ref&gt; Bracha L. Ettinger, ''The Matrixial Gaze''. Published by Leeds University, 1995. Reprinted in: ''Drawing Papers'', nº 24, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; that has established a feminine gaze and has articulated its differences from the phallic gaze and its relation to feminine as well as maternal specificities and potentialities of "coemergence", offering a critique of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s and [[Jacques Lacan]]'s psychoanalysis, is extensively used in analysis of films&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''After-effects - After-images''. Manchester University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Humm, Feminism and Film''. Edinburgh University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; by female authors, like [[Chantal Akerman]],&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Nagib and Anne Jerslev (ends.), ''Impure Cinema''. London: I.B.Tauris.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by male authors, like [[Pedro Almodovar]]&lt;ref&gt;Julian Daniel Gutierrez-Arbilla, ''Aesthetics, Ethics and Trauma in the Cinema of [[Pedro Almodovar]]''. Edinburgh University Press, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. The matrixial gaze offers the female the position of a subject, not of an object, of the gaze, while deconstructing the structure of the subject itself, and offers border-time, border-space and a possibility for compassion and witnessing. Ettinger's notions articulate the links between aesthetics, ethics and trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Rutledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[post-structuralism]] took an increasingly pragmatic approach to the possibilities Theory offered, so too [[Joan Copjec]] criticised early work around the gaze in the light of the work of [[Michel Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199791286/obo-9780199791286-0052.xml Todd McGowan, 'Psychoanalytic Film Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; The role of [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] in cinematic representation came more to the fore,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199791286/obo-9780199791286-0052.xml McGowan]&lt;/ref&gt; and Lacanian analysis was seen to offer fertile ways of speaking of film rather than definitive answers or conclusive self-knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Lapsley, p. 273-6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Punk visual art''' is artwork associated with the [[punk subculture]]. It often graces [[punk rock]] [[album cover]]s, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]] for punk concerts, [[punk zine]]s and punk websites. It is also sometimes showcased in art galleries and exhibition spaces.

The main aesthetic of punk visual art seems to be to either shock, create a sense of empathy or revulsion, make a grand point with an acidic or sarcastic wit. One characteristic associated with punk art is the usage of letters cut out from newspapers and magazines, a device previously associated with kidnap and ransom notes. A prominent example of that style is the cover of the [[Sex Pistols]]' ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks]]'' album designed by [[Jamie Reid]]. Images and figures are also sometimes cut and pasted from magazines and newspapers to create a collage.

Los Angeles artist [[Mark Vallen]] has said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Punk had a unique and complex aesthetic. It was steeped in shock value and revered what was considered ugly. The whole look of punk was designed to disturb and disrupt the happy complacency of the wider society. Outside of punk's torn and safety pinned anti-fashion statements, this impulse to outrage was never more apparent than on punk album covers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-for-a-change.com/Punk/punka.htm "A visual survey of early Punk Rock Album Covers," Essay by artist, Mark Vallen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In New York City in the mid-1970s, there was much overlap between the punk music and art scenes. In 1978, many of the visual artists who were regulars at [[CBGB]] and other punk-related music venues participated in a large punk art exhibition in Washington, DC.  Among those featured were [[John Holmstrom]] and [[Legs McNeil]] of the fanzine ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'',; [[Alan Vega]] (a.k.a. Alan Suicide), whose electronic junk sculpture predated his role in the band [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]];  photographers [[Marcia Resnick]] and [[Jimmy De Sana]]; tattoo artist Ruth Marten; filmmaker Amos Poe; and artists [[Tom Otterness]] and [[Beth and Scott B]], who were associated with ''X Magazine''.

Also in 1978 in New York City, a related, one-night punk art show featuring films, performances and slide shows included works by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] and [[Diego Cortez]].  Other early punk art exhibits included the "Times Square Show" (1980) and "New York New Wave" at PS 1 (1981).  Punk art found an ongoing home on the New York's lower east side with the establishment of [[ABC No Rio]] Gallery in 1980. The punk aesthetic was a dominant strand from 1982 to 1986 in the art galleries of the city's East Village.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5275">'''Reel Women Media''' is a [[filmmaking]] [[non-profit organization]] in [[Austin, Texas]], USA, that provides support to women in the [[film industry]].

[[Ally Acker]] coined the term Reel Women in 1984 for her book ''Reel Women: Pioneers of the Cinema, 1896 to Present'' and documentary series. This was the first production in the market that revealed the transformative roles women had within the film industry that were not as widely recognized by prior film history studies.

Reel Women began in 1995&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Will.

Reel Women serves as a resource to the film community over the years by planning guest speakers, workshops,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klru.org/austinnow/archives/reel_women/reel_women.php "KLRU: Austin Now &gt; Spotlight report: Reel Women"]. &lt;/ref&gt; mixers, and screening events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/1999-10-15/74282/ "Reel Women Shorts"].

'''Robert Penn Warren''' (April 24, 1905 – September 15, 1989) was an American poet, [[novelist]], and literary critic and was one of the founders of [[New Criticism]]. He was also a charter member of the [[Fellowship of Southern Writers]]. He founded the literary journal ''[[The Southern Review]]'' with [[Cleanth Brooks]] in 1935. He received the 1947 [[Pulitzer Prize for the Novel]] for his novel ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1946) and the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in 1958 and 1979. He is the only person to have won Pulitzer Prizes for both fiction and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 27. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Warren was born in [[Guthrie, Kentucky]], very near the [[Tennessee]]-[[Kentucky]] border, to Robert Warren and Anna Penn.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 291. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren's mother's family had roots in Virginia, having given their name to the community of Penn's Store in [[Patrick County, Virginia]], and was a descendant of Revolutionary War soldier Colonel [[Abram Penn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freestateofpatrick.com/pcpeople.htm Patrick County People, Free State of Patrick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711040008/http://www.freestateofpatrick.com/pcpeople.htm |date=2011-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Penn Warren graduated from Clarksville High School in [[Clarksville, Tennessee]], [[Vanderbilt University]] ([[Latin honors|''summa cum laude'']], [[Phi Beta Kappa]]) in 1925 and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (M.A.) in 1926. Warren pursued further graduate study at [[Yale University]] from 1927 to 1928 and obtained his [[B.Litt.]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] from [[New College, Oxford]], in England in 1930. He also received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to study in Italy during the rule of [[Benito Mussolini]]. That same year he began his teaching career at Southwestern College (now [[Rhodes College]]) in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

==Career==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RobertPennWarren.png|thumb|Robert Penn Warren commemorative stamp|{{FFDC|1=RobertPennWarren.png|log=2009 June 10|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;
While still an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University, Warren became associated with the group of poets there known as the [[Fugitives (poets)|Fugitives]], and somewhat later, during the early 1930s, Warren and some of the same writers formed a group known as the [[Southern Agrarians]]. He contributed "The Briar Patch" to the [[Agrarianism|Agrarian]] manifesto ''[[I'll Take My Stand]]'' along with 11 other Southern writers and poets (including fellow Vanderbilt poet/critics [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Allen Tate]], and [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]]). In "The Briar Patch" the young Warren defends racial segregation, in line with  the political leanings of the Agrarian group, although Davidson deemed Warren's stances in the essay so progressive that he argued for excluding it from the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Edwin Thomas. "On Native Soil: A Visit with Robert Penn Warren," ''Mississippi Quarterly'' 38 (Winter 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Warren recanted these views in an article on the [[civil rights movement]], "Divided South Searches Its Soul", which appeared in the July 9, 1956 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. A month later, Warren published an expanded version of the article as a small book titled ''Segregation: The Inner Conflict in the South''.&lt;ref&gt;Metress, Christopher. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3549/is_n1_v32/ai_n28666757/ "Fighting battles one by one: Robert Penn Warren's ''Segregation''"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Southern Review'', Winter 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently adopted a high profile as a supporter of [[racial integration]]. In 1965, he published ''[[Who Speaks for the Negro?]]'', a collection of interviews with black civil rights leaders including [[Malcolm X]] and [[Martin Luther King]], thus further distinguishing his political leanings from the more conservative philosophies associated with fellow Agrarians such as Tate, [[Cleanth Brooks]], and particularly Davidson. Warren's interviews with civil rights leaders are at the [[Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History]] at the University of Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uky.edu/libraries/nunncenter Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren's best-known work is ''[[All the King's Men]]'', a novel that won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1947. Main character [[Willie Stark (character)|Willie Stark]] resembles [[Huey Pierce Long]] (1893–1935), the radical [[Populism|populist]] governor of [[Louisiana]] whom Warren was able to observe closely while teaching at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]] from 1933 to 1942. ''All the King's Men'' became a highly successful film, starring [[Broderick Crawford]] and winning the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in 1949. A 2006 film adaptation by writer/director [[Steven Zaillian]] featured [[Sean Penn]] as Willie Stark and [[Jude Law]] as Jack Burden. The opera ''[[Willie Stark]]'' by [[Carlisle Floyd]] to his own libretto based on the novel was first performed in 1981.

Warren served as the [[Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]], 1944–1945 (later termed [[Poet Laureate]]), and won two Pulitzer Prizes in poetry, in 1958 for ''Promises: Poems 1954–1956'' and in 1979 for ''Now and Then''. ''Promises'' also won the annual [[National Book Award for Poetry]].&lt;ref name=nba1958&gt;

In 1974, the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] selected him for the [[Jefferson Lecture]], the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]]. Warren's lecture was entitled "Poetry and Democracy" (subsequently published under the title ''Democracy and Poetry'').&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lectures].

Retrieved September 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1977, Warren was awarded the [[St. Louis Literary Award]] from the [[Saint Louis University]] Library Associates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slu.edu/libraries/associates/award.html Website of St. Louis Literary Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |title=Recipients of the St. Louis Literary Award |work= |author=Saint Louis University Library Associates |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731082313/http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |archive-date=July 31, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Warren was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. In 1981, Warren was selected as a [[MacArthur Fellow]] and later was named as the first U.S. [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry]] on February 26, 1986. In 1987, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#87 Lifetime Honors - National Medal of Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054307/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren was co-author, with [[Cleanth Brooks]], of ''[[Understanding Poetry]]'', an influential literature textbook. It was followed by other similarly co-authored textbooks, including  ''Understanding Fiction'', which was praised by [[Southern Gothic]] and Roman Catholic writer [[Flannery O'Connor]], and ''Modern Rhetoric'', which adopted what can be called a [[New Critical]] perspective.

==Personal life==
His first marriage was to Emma Brescia. His second marriage was in 1952 to [[Eleanor Clark]], with whom he had two children, [[Rosanna Warren|Rosanna Phelps Warren]] (born 1953) and Gabriel Penn Warren (born 1955). During his tenure at Louisiana State University he resided at Twin Oaks (otherwise known as the [[Robert Penn Warren House]]) in Prairieville, Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/hp/nationalregister/nhl/parish03/scans/03018001.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019140957/http://www.crt.state.la.us/hp/nationalregister/nhl/parish03/scans/03018001.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived the latter part of his life in [[Fairfield, Connecticut]], and [[Stratton, Vermont]] where he died of complications from prostate cancer. He is buried at Stratton, Vermont, and, at his request, a memorial marker is situated in the Warren family gravesite in Guthrie, Kentucky.

==Legacy==
In April 2005, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a commemorative stamp to mark the 100th anniversary of Warren's birth. Introduced at the post office in his native Guthrie, it depicts the author as he appeared in a 1948 photograph, with a background scene of a political rally designed to evoke the setting of ''All the King's Men''. His son and daughter, Gabriel and [[Rosanna Warren]], were in attendance.

Vanderbilt University houses the [[Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities]], which is sponsored by the College of Arts and Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/rpw_center/ Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities]&lt;/ref&gt; It began its programs in January 1988, and in 1989 received a $480,000 Challenge Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The center promotes "interdisciplinary research and study in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences."

The high school that Robert Penn Warren attended, Clarksville High School (Tennessee), was renovated into an apartment complex in 1982. The original name of the apartments was changed to The Penn Warren in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Penn Warren - History|url=http://thepennwarren.com/history/|website=ThePennWarren.com|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sintra Collar''' is a Bronze Age gold neck-ring found near [[Sintra]] in [[Portugal]]. Since 1900, it has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection and has long been admired for the sophistication and geometric beauty of its design and technique.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1363132&amp;partId=1&amp;people=26619&amp;peoA=26619-3-17&amp;page=1], British Museum, retrieved 16 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
The Sintra Collar is made of three thick round bars of graduated [[diameters]] which have been tapered and fused together at the ends. A ribbed link-plate is loosely attached by means of hooks at the end which pass through [[perforation]]s. The front segments of the bars carry incised [[geometric]] decoration of parallel lines, divided into panels and fringed by a series of [[triangles]] (known as dog's tooth design). Attached at either end are two separately formed cups of [[gold]], with an internal spike and moulding. The catch-plate is ornamented with five ribs, three of which have incised oblique lines.

==Discovery==
The gold [[Collar (jewelry)|collar]] was allegedly found in 1878 by workers digging a ditch in a stone [[quarry]] in the Casal Amaro parish of Santa Maria, near Sintra in [[Portugal]]. According to reports at the time, the neck-ring was found with human bones in a grave. Soon after its discovery, the finds were purchased by the landowner. It was later bought by the [[London]] dealers John Hall Junior &amp; Co, who sold it to the British Museum at the [[turn of the century]].

==Importance==
The Sintra Collar is one of a number of similar [[bronze-age]] jewellery finds recorded along the [[Atlantic]] seaboard of Europe. Its decoration, for example, is paralleled in contemporary [[torc]]s found in southern [[Spain]] at sites such as Sagrajas near [[Badajoz]]. However, its complex design of tapering bars and catch-plate with accompanying hooks is unique.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2844">'''Stiletto dance''' is a dance form that emerged and evolved in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It is named after the [[stiletto heel]] women's shoe style, since one of its distinguishing features is the wearing of high-heel shoes during performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Stiletto_dancer.jpg|thumb|right|Stiletto dance artist performing in a night club variety show]]

Stiletto dance is a solo dance genre inspired by dance routines seen in pop and hip-hop music videos. Its techniques and dance vocabulary derive from a wide range of dance styles used in music video-style choreographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by dynamic footwork based on [[jazz dance]], [[ballroom dance]], [[Latin dance]] and [[go-go dancing]] styles, torso isolations borrowed from [[belly dance]] and [[hip hop dance]] and floor work, fluid arm work and body language coming from [[exotic dancing]] and contemporary dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Stiletto dance is not a [[social dance]] style, it is seen mainly in the context of stage performance or as a women's [[physical fitness]] movement discipline taught and practiced in workout format in fitness clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''The Book of the Book''''' is a book by [[Idries Shah]]. The majority of the book's 200 pages are blank, with the remaining nine pages telling the story of a book left by a wise man consisting of one sentence and attempts over hundreds of years to discern the intended meaning. 

[[Lawrence Paul Elwell-Sutton]] writing for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' said, "I suppose his admirers among the Hampstead intelligentsia will have swallowed this buffoonery with the same enthusiasm with which they have gulped down the rest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1970/10/22/the-mysterious-east-2/|title=The Mysterious East|last=Elwell-Sutton|first=L. P.|last2=Lessing|first2=Doris|date=July 2, 1970|website=The New York Review of Books|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Doris Lessing]] responded to Elwell-Sutton's remarks, in the ''New York Review of Books'', stating "Ignorance, I will admit, is no crime, and I am sure that Dr. Elwell-Sutton does not claim to be a literary man. But motivation has its mysteries." 

A review in [[Studies in Comparative Religion]] stated "The Book of the Book, which purports to be an object lesson in the problem of the container and the content, consists of some fifteen pages of print bound together with over 250 blank pages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''The Romantic Anonymous Fellowship''' was founded by the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] painter [[Odysseus Yakoumakis]] on September 2004, as the first, and currently the only, Greek group of [[Stuckism|Stuckism International]]. It has an international membership.

==History==
[[Odysseus Yakoumakis]] discovered Stuckism in July, 2004, while surfing the net, and saw in it an antidote to what he deems "the ailments of the contemporary Greek 'artscape'".&lt;ref&gt;This issue is taken up in Yakoumis' article, "The Academic Provincialism of contemporary Greek Art and its proposed Stuckist remedy", to be presented by him at the first Stuckist international symposium [http://www.student.livjm.ac.uk/lsaiwyli/TheTriumphOfStuckism/index.html ''The Triumph of Stuckism''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414172054/http://www.student.livjm.ac.uk/lsaiwyli/TheTriumphOfStuckism/index.html |date=2006-04-14 }} in Liverpool, England&lt;/ref&gt; He contacted [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], the London founder of Stuckism, and a few days later founded The Romantic Anonymous Fellowship. He conceived this as a "Greek version of Stuckism, an antidote to contemporary Greek art's [[Parochialism|provincialism]], [[sectarianism]] and servile importation of [[post-modernism]]". He developed the concept of "Romantic Stuckism", that is of "Stuckism with a good injection of [[Eleatic]] and [[Platonic philosophy]], oriented rather towards encouraging each artist to pursue his/her genuinely personal artistic vision rather, than towards pointless polemics against the reactionary official art-establishment". He published the first two Romantic Stuckist theoretical texts on the Fellowship's website.

At that stage he was the Fellowship's only fellow and, as far as he knew, the only artist in Greece aware of the Stuckist movement. He contacted other fine artists in Athens, but described the reactions he got as "ranging from a tepid 'academic curiosity' to a sheer lack of interest or even, occasionally, to a politely concealed hostility."  He was however contacted by artists from overseas and accepted them into the Fellowship. The first to apply was [http://www.ianjburkett.co.uk/ Ian J. Burkett], a painter living in London and founder of the Ealing Stuckists group. Shortly after, followed the painter and etcher [http://www.ilaniaabileah.com/ Ilania Abileah] from Canada, and the painter and etcher [http://www.artworksbyanthe.com/ Anthe] (who is of Greek descent) from the US.

==Under the Cover of Romantic Anonymity==
Yakoumakis determined that Stuckism should, nevertheless, be brought "in the flesh" before the eyes of the Greek fine arts community, and organised the first Stuckist event in Greece, titled ''Under the Cover of Romantic Anonymity'', announced for May 14 of 2010 at the Ash-In-Art Gallery, Athens, Greece.

In parallel with the show, the new book by Odysseus Yakoumakis will be featured, titled "Leaflets from the Wilderness (a case study about the artscape in nouveau-Greece and many other lands)" (Ash-In-Art Publications).

Stuckist artists taking part include:

'''''The Wedding Dance''''' (sometimes known as '''''The Dance Village''''') is a 1566 oil-on-panel painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. Owned by the museum of the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the work was discovered by its director in England in 1930, and brought to Detroit. It is believed to be one of a set of three Bruegel works from around the same time, ''The Wedding Dance'', ''[[The Peasant Wedding]]'' (1567) and ''[[The Peasant Dance]]'' (1569).

The painting depicts 125 wedding guests. As was customary in the Renaissance period, the brides wore black and men wore [[codpiece]]s. [[Voyeurism]] is depicted throughout the entire art work; dancing was disapproved of by the authorities and the church, and the painting can be seen as both a critique and comic depiction of a stereotypical oversexed, overindulgent, peasant class of the times.

==Background==
Pieter Bruegel the Elder completed ''The Wedding Dance'' in 1566. It is believed to have been lost for many years, until discovered at a sale in London in 1930 by William R. Valentiner, the  director of the [[Detroit Institute of Arts|Museum Detroit Institute of Arts]] at the time.&lt;ref name="ArtsHenshaw1985"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Detroit Institute of Arts|author2=Henshaw, Julia Plummer|title=100 masterworks from the Detroit Institute of Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OsyfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 June 2012|year=1985|publisher=Hudson Hills Press, in association with the Founders Society, Detroit Institute of Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morse|first=John D.|title=Old Master Paintings in North America: Over 3000 Masterpieces by 50 Great Artists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d13JjhbUdRAC|accessdate=14 June 2012|year=1979|publisher=Abbeville Press|isbn=978-0-89659-050-2|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruegel1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruegel|first=Pieter|title=Pieter Bruegel the Elder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jvUyAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=4 June 2012|year=1970|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valentiner paid $35,075 for ''The Wedding Dance'' through a city appropriation.&lt;ref name="Sterne1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterne|first=Margaret Heiden|title=The Passionate Eye: The Life of William R.

''[[The Peasant Wedding]]'' (1567) and ''[[The Peasant Dance]]'' (1569) are also by Bruegel which share the same wedding theme and elements and were painted in the same period in Bruegel's later years. They are considered to be a trilogy of works by Bruegel.&lt;ref name="Bonn2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brugel's Peasants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18881444.html|title=Bruegel's Peasants: Art and Audience in the Northern Renaissance|date=22 September 1996|accessdate=22 June 2012|publisher=Renaissance Quarterly|author1=Serebrennikov, Nina Eugenia|author2=Sullivan, Margaret A|location=Cambridge, New York and Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 1994}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all three of the paintings, there are pipers playing the [[Doedelzak|pijpzak]] (bagpipes), they also exude pride and vanity, for example in ''The Peasant Dance'' the man seated next to the pijpzak player is wearing a peacock feather in his hat.&lt;ref name="s3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/~bevans/pieter%20brugel%20grove%20bio.pdf|title=Pieter Bruegel the Elder Grove Bio|publisher=Grove Art Online&amp;nbsp;— Montgomery College|date=|accessdate=8 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406093519/http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/~bevans/pieter%20brugel%20grove%20bio.pdf|archivedate=6 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T011669pg1|title=Grove Bruegel|publisher=Oxford Art Online {{subscription required}}|year=2005|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert L. Bonn, an author, described these trilogy of works as "superb examples" of anthropological paintings, and states that "in three genre paintings Bruegel stands in marked contrast both to painters of his day and many others who followed."&lt;ref name="Bonn2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonn|first=Robert L.|title=Painting Life: The Art of Pieter Bruegel, The Elder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2kCz9aeeW4C&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=9 June 2012|year=2006|publisher=Bonn, Robert|isbn=978-1-884092-12-1|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Craven]] summarises ''The Wedding Dance'' as "One of several celebrations of the joys of [[gluttony]] painted by Brueghel with bursting vitality".&lt;ref name="Craven1977"&gt;{{cite book|last=Craven|first=Thomas|title=A Treasury of Art Masterpieces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LnJYg1cR4vkC|accessdate=9 June 2012|date=26 May 1977|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-22776-0|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter S.

Each guest's positioning in the painting has its own meaning. In the foreground there is a dancer wearing the colours of that time period and there are many peasants in that area.

The movements of the people show that their behaviour is inappropriate or a caricature of rustic buffoonery, but its representation of fertility and reproduction is presented in a joyful manner.&lt;ref name="b1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="b3"/&gt; Indeed, the painting reflects a degree of ambiguity in that it can both be seen as an attack on the stereotypical oversexed behaviour of the lower orders as well as evoking a comical picture.&lt;ref name="Quist2004"/&gt; In the sixteenth century, when this was painted, dance was subject to a strict code and regarded by the authorities and church as a social evil.&lt;ref name="Quist2004"/&gt; People could not swing their arms or legs or laugh too loud, as that would be considered a type of rudeness to many people.&lt;ref name="Quist2004"/&gt; The painting therefore "expresses the peasants' liberation from the stricter limits of upper classes" by failing to adhere to the expected social standards of the times.&lt;ref name="Quist2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Quist|first=Robert|title=The Theme of Music in Northern Renaissance Banquet Scenes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TjT6QSvfzZgC&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=9 June 2012|year=2004|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-54063-2|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rules1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kitchenmusician.net/smoke/dancing.html|title=Dancing, 16th Century|publisher=Kitchen Musician|date=12 May 2012|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="all-art history230-13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-art.org/history230-13.html|title=The High Renaissance &amp; Mannerism|publisher=All-Art|date=|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of ''The Theme of Music in Northern Renaissance Banquet Scenes'', [[Robert Quist]], has said that the painting was part of a series of Seven Deadly Sins and Virtues and that the paintings "attest to [Bruegel's] moral devotions". He says "While dancing may appear innocuous or natural for peasants, it poses a palpable threat to the human soul. Its [dancing] usefulness in characterizing the peasantry as wild and unruly undoubtedly derives from the moral opprobrium in which dancing was held by religious and civil authoriries alike.&lt;ref name="Quist2004"/&gt;

{{Costume}}
Some authors have argued that '''use of costume in Athenian tragedy''' was standardized for the [[genre]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to have consisted of a full-length or short tunic, a cloak and soft leather boots, and may have been derived from the robes of [[Dionysos|Dionysian]] priests or invented by [[Aeschylus]]. Brockett, however, disputes this, arguing that the evidence we have is based on archaeological remains, some few references in the texts, and the writings of later authors. As far as the vase paintings are concerned, most of these are dated later than the 5th Century BCE and their relationship with theatrical practice is unclear. One of the earliest examples is a red-figure vase painting c. 500-490 BCE that shows a tragic [[Greek chorus|chorus]] invoking a ghost, on a crater (bowl) in the Antikenmuseum in Basle.&lt;ref name="The Ancient Theatre, E. Simon"&gt;Simon, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragic actors were certainly heavily disguised. This had a religious purpose, for the actor was supposed to give up his identity in order to let another speak and act through him. Indeed, the dramas were performed in honour of [[Dionysus]], the God of Ecstasy, which means “standing outside oneself”.&lt;ref name="The Ancient Theatre, E. Simon"/&gt; Actors therefore had to renounce their individuality. The actors thought that the mask itself contained the character and are said to have prayed before putting on their masks. The costume was probably an elaborately-decorated version of everyday clothing worn in the 5th Century BCE. The garments included:

* ''[[chiton (costume)|chiton]]'' (robe or tunic)
* ''chlaina'' (overgarment)
* ''[[chlamys]]'' (short cloak)
* [[buskin|''kothurnus'']] (short lace-up boots)
* ''[[himation]]'' (overgarment)
* ''[[peplos]]'' (cloak).&lt;ref&gt;Laver&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''chiton'' worn by the actors differed from that worn in everyday life because it incorporated sleeves, which were coloured and patterned. The sleeves may in fact have been part of an undergarment. Long white sleeves were worn by the (male) actors for female roles, and indeed, in vase paintings females are usually painted with lighter skin.

The costumes worn for the performances of ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', for example, were [[Iconography|iconographic]], and symbolised the opposition of light and dark.&lt;ref&gt;Wiles, 1999, p159.&lt;/ref&gt; In the play, life is evoked as the act of seeing the sun. Death – the son of Night in [[Greek mythology]] - wears a black peplos and black wings. [[Apollo]] wears white, representing the sun. Admetus contrasts the black of the funeral procession with the white of the funeral procession. The corpse of Alcestis is dressed as a bride, in accordance with Greek tradition and [[Herakles]] wears a bearskin and carries a club.

The costumes worn gave the audience an immediate sense of character-type, gender, age, social status and class.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm, 1994, p65 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of [[Aeschylus]], the boots or [[buskin]]s worn by the actors were flat. The actors had the same “status” as the [[Greek chorus|chorus]]. In the 3rd Century BCE, the actors were raised to the status of heroes and “platform” soles began to be used, together with a head-dress called an ''onkos''. The raised soles may have induced a stylised way of walking, suited to the rhythm of tragic verse, and the ''onkos'' made the actors taller, enhancing visibility. Their bodies were padded so that they did not look too slim.&lt;ref name="Laver"&gt;Laver.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors believe that this happened later than the 3rd Century BCE. It is also thought that the “teetering gait” is a misapprehension.&lt;ref&gt;McLeish.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mask]]s were the most striking feature of the costume worn by the Athenian actors. Facial expression was lost anyway due to the huge size of the [[Theatre of Dionysus|Greek theatres]], but the masks were also a means of blotting out expression, so visual meaning was expressed by the entire body. The actors were seen as silhouettes, or integral bodies, rather than faces. The masks themselves were made of stiffened linen, thin clay, cork or wood, and covered the whole head and had hair.

Attempts have been made in modern times to investigate the use of masks in Athenian tragedy through [[practice research]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Walton, 2007, p. 247 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; These explorations conclude that masks may lead to a more demonstrative style of acting, with declamatory delivery of the lines substituted for intimacy. They also found that the mask could impede the projection of sound. The Greeks are said to have overcome this in various ways. Initially, the mouth apertures were small, but later this became a “wide-open” mouth. Some authors believe that the mouth was shaped like a “mouth-trumpet” and had an amplifying effect.&lt;ref&gt;Simon.&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, the use of a mask covering the whole produces an enhanced resonating effect, which serves dramatic delivery.

Performances therefore had to be more physical. Peter Arnott states that the Greeks thought good acting and a good voice were synonymous. This was achieved through athletic training, voice exercises and diet.

Experiments have shown that unaccustomed actors suffer disorientation and restriction when masked. The Greeks countered this through a vocabulary of gesture known as ''cheironomia'' (gesticulation). [[Aristotle]] says that in his day excessive gestures were used – leading to overacting – compared with the older tradition.

Masks can also be used as a dramatic tool, e.g. lowering the masks shows reflection, raising the mask shows a challenge or superiority. The Greeks called these physical stances ''schemata'' (forms).

Silent masks were used to great effect, particularly on child actors, expressing powerlessness, bewilderment, vulnerability, etc.

The use of masks enabled the three speaking actors to portray up to eight or nine characters, through multiple role-playing. The same character could therefore be played by different actors, and transitions within a character would be portrayed by the use of different masks.

The wide variety of masks used is attested by [[Julius Pollux|Pollux]], a rhetorician writing in 2nd Century CE, in his ''[[Onomastikon]]''.&lt;ref name="Laver"/&gt; He lists 30 different male masks (old age with white or grey hair, the tyrant with thick black hair, a fair, pale masks indicating sorrow or sickness, a boastful soldier, a rustic, servants, a cook, etc.) and 17 female masks (fat and thin old women, two matrons, one virgin, a bawd, a mistress, three courtesans, a lady’s maid, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48491">{{Culture of Vietnam}}
'''Vietnamese art'''  is [[visual art]] that, whether ancient or modern, originated in or is practiced in Vietnam or by Vietnamese artists.

==Introduction==
Vietnamese art has a long and rich history, the earliest examples of which date back as far as the [[Stone Age]] around 8,000 [[BCE]] &lt;ref name="vietnamese art artists history"&gt;{{cite web|publisher= widewalls|title=vietnamese art artists history|url= https://www.widewalls.ch/vietnamese-art-artists-history/    }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

With the millennium of [[History of Vietnam|Chinese domination]] starting in the 2nd century BC, Vietnamese art undoubtedly absorbed many Chinese influences, which would continue even following independence from China in the 10th century AD.  However, Vietnamese art has always retained many distinctively Vietnamese characteristics.

By the 19th century, the influence of [[French art]] took hold in Vietnam, having a large hand in the birth of modern Vietnamese art.

==Vietnamese art throughout the ages==

===Neolithic art===
[[File:Gom1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Terracotta pieces used to imprint decoration patterns on cloth]]
Pottery dating to the [[Stone Age]] [[(c. 8000 BCE)]] has been found in Bac Son, Vietnam.  This pottery was made from clay, and in its beginnings was largely basic and lacking any artistic flare.  Moving into the neolithic era, however, [[Vietnamese pottery]] and ceramics started to develop rapidly, showing signs of decor.

===Bronze Age art===

The highly developed [[Đông Sơn culture]] that flourished in [[North Vietnam]] (from about 1000 BC to the 4th century BC) was the civilization responsible for the world-famous [[Đông Sơn drums]], a product of their advanced bronze-casting skills.

These drums give us an important peek into early Vietnamese life.  They were elaborately decorated with [[geometric patterns]], and most importantly, depicted scenes of everyday life such as farming, warriors donning feather headdresses, construction of ships, musicians, etc.

Archaeological evidence from this period also shows that people in the area had long been weaving cloth.  Many of the people depicted on the drums are shown as wearing elaborate clothing.

===Chinese domination from 111 BC to 939 AD===
During the ten centuries of rule by the Chinese, Vietnamese began to apply newly learned Chinese techniques to art and specifically ceramics, however this was in conjunction with the continued production of art based on native methods; this is proven by excavation of Chinese tombs in the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vietnamartbooks.com/articles/article.html?id=67 Pottery and ceramics during Chinese rule&lt;/ref&gt;

===From the Ngô to Trần Dynasty===

Vietnamese art and ceramics during this period of independence (approximately 10th to 15th centuries) flourished.  The ceramics from this period were thought to have been largely influenced by both ancient native styles and the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and later [[Song Dynasty]]'s art, including applying the "three colors" concept to its ceramics.  Chinese-influenced philosophies adopted by the Vietnamese such as [[Confucianism]], [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] all had a lasting impression on Vietnamese art. Some also claim there are small traces of [[Art of Champa|Cham]] influences to be found as well.

The [[Lý Dynasty]], beginning in the 11th century is viewed specifically as the golden age of Vietnamese art, and its ceramics became famous across East and Southeast Asia.  The Lý Dynasty also saw the construction of many of Vietnam's landmark structures, including the [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]], One-pillar pagoda, and Quynh Lam pagoda.  The [[Trần Dynasty]] that immediately followed in the 13th century saw a more subdued approach to art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2005/10/501151/ |title=VietNamNet Bridge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504205207/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/lifestyle/2005/10/501151/ |archive-date=2007-05-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth Chinese domination and Lê Dynasty===
[[File:DoGo.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Pieces of wooden art from 17th and 18th century]]
The [[fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam]] was quite short-lived, lasting only about 2 decades, yet it was also seen as the harshest domination.  Many if not most classical Vietnamese books were burnt, and thus much documentation of the era of independence lost.  It is said that a more extreme than-ever process of [[sinicization]] was enforced, and countless Vietnamese resources and goods were removed and taken to China.

Consequently, much of the art in this period and even after liberation by the [[Lê Dynasty]] was heavily influenced by the [[Ming Dynasty]]'s art.

====Nguyễn Dynasty====
The [[Nguyễn Dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam, saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art.  Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.

Despite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguyễn Dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguyễn Dynasty.

==Modern art==
Vietnam Modern Art includes artistic work materialized during colonial period between 1860s to 1970s, and significantly ascribed to the founding of “[[École Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de L'Indochine|Ecole Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine]]” in October 1925.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Viet Nam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=Esapce Méridien|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1925, paintings and carvings were mainly created for religious purpose, in a decorative manner for example lacquered furniture and utilitarian ceramic and porcelains, subordinated to demands by the local temples and pagodas use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A striking “shift” was obvious after the founding of [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine|Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indohine]] EBAI, observing a gradual change in perception of art, and the beginning recognition of art for art’s sake.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for Symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=2008|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese artists experimented with new ways of seeing, with ideas from 2 important French teachers, it marks an intensifying [[Cultural transformation theory|cultural transfer]] and [[modernity]].  

=== The Colonial Period 1925 - 1945 ===
[[File:Xã-Xệ et Lý-Toét.jpg|thumb|An cartoon illustrated in Phong Hoa|alt=|left]]
[[Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine|Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indohine]] EBAI was founder by [[Victor Tardieu]], a French academic and naturalist painter.&lt;ref&gt;ibid, p5&lt;/ref&gt; With a report commission sent to the general Government of Indochina, Victor Tardieu recommended setting up a school “EBAI in Indochina” to train real artists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Art from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike, Ecole professionnelle” in Hanoi, “Ecole des Arts Cambodgeins”  and other three schools set up in Cochinchina between 1902 – 1913 these schools were professional schools to train craftsmen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tardieu’s idea was to adapt exiting curriculum used in “Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris” by including art history; technical course like oil painting and perspective, to train student into real artist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He planned to “help the Vietnamese artist to get back in touch with the deep meaning and fundamental inspiration of their own traditions”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ngay Nay (Nowadays) Phong Hoa (mores) which was associated with Tu Luc Vaan Doan (Self Reliance Literary Association), were committed to modernising Vietnamese culture through the crucial assessment of both Vietnam's tradition and Western modernity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A City that remembers in the making of modern vietnam|last=Nguyen|first=Van Ky|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;Students in the EBAI were columnist in this 2 weekly magazines, illustrating cartoons and exhibition information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=Scott|first=Phoebe|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stylized cartoon illustration were in fact very modern, depicting simple messages.

===== Oil Painting =====
[[File:Hai thieu nu va em be.JPG|thumb|To Ngoc Van, Deux Jeunes filles et un enfants, 1944, oil on canvas, Museum of Fine Arts, Hanoi|alt=|270x270px]]
Following closely to the curriculum of [[École des Beaux-Arts de Paris|Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Paris]], oil painting was first introduced to students as a completely new medium.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=2008|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although western art, in this case, oil painting, was likely first encountered by Le Van Mien (1873-1943) in L’Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux- Arts de Paris, who returned to Hanoi in 1895, no record shows that he taught and trained craftsman in Bien Hoa or Gia Dinh this western medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Post Dôi Mói Vietnamese Art After 1990|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for the exhibition Post-Doi Moi: Vietnamese Art after 1990|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This medium was thoroughly unknown to the students, and [[Joseph Inguimberty]] though it would be hard to assimilate the oil painting techniques to them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
Artist like [[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] was able to combine western aesthetic techniques like linear perspective, imitation of nature and modelling in the round into his own oriental traditions with oil medium.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Stylized as the ‘poetic reality’ style, his works sets female ideals into a linear perspective in an enclosed space, juxtapositioned with flat coloured area, his works emulates with the tendency idealization imagery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== En Plein Air =====

Similarly, en plein air was another major practice instituted in EBAI’s curriculum.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students were brought outdoor for field trips to develop their painting sense of the environment. As noted by art historian Nora Taylor, &lt;blockquote&gt;“[He … propped his easel under a tree by rice paddy, took off his shirt and proceeded to sketch farmers planting their rice seedlings. Needless to say he earned quite a few giggles and embarrassed glances from his subjects.’ Nobody took off their shirts in public, not even the farmers in the fields. The French did and so did [[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Nora|date=1997|title=The Artist and the state|url=|journal=The Politics of painting and National Identity in Hanoi, Vietnam 1925 - 1999|volume=|pages=50|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;This example quoted by Taylor, argues that the tendency of idealization, we see in To Nga Van’s painting reflects a distancing and detachment with the subject matter, a result of artist’s attempt to emulate their French teachers inclusive of whatever they do.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
Other than oil medium and en plein air painting method, significant assimilation and adaption of local culture were encouraged by [[Victor Tardieu]] and his successor [[Joseph Inguimberty|Joseph Imguimberty]]. 

==== Lacquer Painting ====
[[File:Confucius - Temple of Literature, Hanoi - DSC04635.JPG|thumb|Interior of Temple of Literature|alt=|left]]
[[File:Confucius - Temple of Literature, Hanoi - DSC04600.JPG|thumb|The wares placed on altar were lacquered wares that inspired Joseph Imguimberty to plan a workshop for lacquer painting the studenst in EBAI|alt=]]
[[Joseph Inguimberty|Joseph Imguimberty]] was fascinated by the lacquered cultural objects and architecture fixtures after visiting the [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]] in Hanoi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Post Dôi Mói Vietnamese Art After 1990|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for the exhibition Post-Doi Moi: Vietnamese Art after 1990|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged his students to start using lacquer as a fine art medium, and set up workshops in EBAI with old artisans, playing an renaissance role in Lacquer painting. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;“falling back on the past will be efficient only if it is used as a starting point for a new research, for an evolution in line with the contemporary eras; to summarise, the question is to evolve as contemporaries within an extensive of tradition.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Out Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Victor Tardieu]]''&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Nguyen Gia Tri Women in the Garden.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|303.993x303.993px|Lacquer painting by Nguyen Gia Tri shows distinctive french influence of "romantic realism" style, yet a blend of localized culture iconography within the work]]
Making lacquer painting takes several months, using resin from Son tree taken from the plantation from [[Sơn mài|Son Mai]] region, numerous layers of application are applied to acquire the desired colour and effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Post Dôi Mói Vietnamese Art After 1990|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for the exhibition Post-Doi Moi: Vietnamese Art after 1990|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most notable artist who excelled in this medium is [[Nguyễn Gia Trí|Nguyen Gia Tri]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although artists like [[Trần Quang Trân|Tran Quang Tran]], [[Lê Phổ|Le Pho]], Phan Hau, [[Nguyễn Khang (painter)|Nguyen Khang]] and Nguyen Van Que attempted lacquer painting, [[Nguyễn Gia Trí|Nguyen Gia Tri]]'s achievement in lacquer painting is remarkable for his research on pigments and exploration of new lacquer colours.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nguyen Gia Tri's aim “ was to obtain the same level of painting as with the oil medium regarding perspective, modelling in the round, and infinite variation of colours”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

==== Silk Painting ====
[[File:Le Pho Maternity.jpg|thumb|Le Pho silk painting styled closely similar to a classic "Madonna nursing baby" triangle composition]]
Other artists like [[Nguyễn Phan Chánh|Nguyen Phanh Chanh]], [[Lê Phổ|Le Pho]], [[Mai Thứ|Mai Trung Thu]], [[Trần Văn Cẩn|Tan Van Can]], [[Lê Văn Đệ|Le Van De]],  who were the first batch of students to be admitted in EBAI, are most notable for their silk painting.&lt;ref&gt;ibid, pg 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Like lacquer painting, silk painting was much encouraged for exploration in the school. Different from similar practice of silk painting in China and Japan, an intensifying of cultural transfer was observed in Vietnamese silk painting, artist like [[Nguyễn Phan Chánh|Nguyen Phan Chan]] blended western composition principle with eastern tradition like calligraphy and brush paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Choi o an quan-Nguyen Phan Chanh.jpg|left|thumb|269.983x269.983px|Choi o an quan (Mandarin square) Children Playing a Game of Squares]]
In 1931, Paris International Colonial Exhibition, [[Nguyễn Phan Chánh|Nguyen Phan Chan]]’s work titled ''Children Playing a Game of Squares'' was well-received and this recognition firmly established the medium as a modern Vietnamese expression.

Between 1930 – 1936, Nguyen Phan Chan, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu and Nguyen Gia Tri, graduated from EBAI. Victor Tardieu passed away in 1937 and he was took after by [[Évariste Jonchère|Evariste Jonchere]]. [[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] begin teaching in EBAI in 1937. Artists like Bui Xuan Phai and Nguyen Tu Nghiem who entered EBAI in 1941 was unable to complete the full five-year programme due to the 1945 revolution.

A bombing of Hanoi that was intended for Japanese target destroyed part of the EBAI painting department in 1943, resulting the sculpture department to be moved to Son Tay; Architecture and sculpture department to Dalat while applied arts went to Phu Ly.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Post Dôi Mói Vietnamese Art After 1990|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for the exhibition Post-Doi Moi: Vietnamese Art after 1990|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Time of Resistance wars 1945 - 1975 ===
Resistance war uproar marks the official close down of EBAI in 1945. Democratic Republic of Vietnam reopened a fine arts school in Hanoi for a short period of time in September 1945 ruled by To Ngoc Van. However, artist were sympathetic of the Viet Minh and decided to leave Hanoi to join the resistance movement against French in the Hills of [[Northwest (Vietnam)|Tay Bac]]. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

==== Artists in the North ====
Notable group of artists in the North during the Cold War were [[Tô Ngọc Vân]], [[Trần Văn Cẩn]], Huỳnh Phương Đong, Phạm Thanh Tâm, Minh Tuyen, Hoang Trung.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cfa.nus.edu.sg/calendar/19-wwrw|title="Who Wants To Remember A War?"

When Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam’s independence in 2 September 1945,  Vietnamese artist begin to resist the influence of romantic realism, tendency for nostalgia past and melancholic dreams. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist like [[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] shook off his romantic style and turned towards modern realism, he moved the closed EBAI (after the Japanese coup de force in March 1945) to Viet Bac in 1950, the military base of the Revolutionary Army under Ho Chi Minh.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“[He]… decided that art, as the French saw it, died in 1945 when Viet Nam declared its independence and was reborn in 1946 when the Viet Minh moved the art school to the hills of Viet Bac, the seat of the revolutionary movement. In 1946, He declared proudly ‘tradition starts now.’” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Nora|date=1997|title=The Artist and the State|url=|journal=The Politics of Painting and National Identity in Hanoi, Vietnam 1925 - 75|volume=|pages=84|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Hình ảnh Tô Ngọc Vân vẽ về cuộc di tản.jpg|thumb|To Ngoc Van's painting style changed drastically away from the usual ideal women he painted before the resistance war.]]
[[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] begin teaching resistance art classes in the Northern zone during the war with the French. This includes setting up the "School of Fine Arts in the Resistance Zone", and combating against decadent art being scientific, national and popular,  art have to abandon religion, mythical and idealists theme, focusing solely on the inspiration and needs of the revolution and being appealing and educational to a majority of people.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Hence artists like Nguyen Hiem, [[Nguyễn Sáng|Nguyen Sang]], Phan Van Don and [[Trần Văn Cẩn|Tran Van Can]] created works that depicted the countrysides, portraits of peasants, soldiers battles scenes, they uphold the belief that artist should show the reality of society instead of idealised imageries.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
[[Tô Ngọc Vân|To Ngoc Van]] died in 1954 as the result of injuries received at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]], School of Fine Arts in the Resistance Zone was later moved to Hanoi in 1955 and named as the “Vietnam College of Fine Arts” with [[Trần Văn Cẩn|Tran Van Can]] as the principal.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[File:Gap Nhau by Mai Van Hien.jpg|left|thumb|302.986x302.986px|'''Mai Van Hien, Meeting (Gap Nhau), gouache on paper, 1954''']]
First National Art Exhibition in the Democratic Republic of Vietna in 1955, after the victory at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Dien Bein Phu]] where Meeting (Gap Nhau) by [[Mai Van Hien]] was praised as the ideal painting that illustrates the idea of community and solidarity between the soldiers and the common people.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; "The mood of the painting is reflected in the artist’s simple descriptive style, which lends itself well to its content."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Nora|date=December 2011|title=Framing the National Spirit – Viewing and Reviewing Painting under the Revolution|url=|journal=http://www.vxartnews.com/2011/12/framing-the-national-spirit-viewing-and-reviewing-painting-under-the-revolution-part-2/|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a Painting Exhibition that in happened December 10, 1951, Ho Chi Minh sent a message to the artists that  "you, in the artistic field, have your own responsibilities - to serve the resistance, the Fatherland and the people, first and foremost the workers, peasants and soldiers,"&lt;ref&gt;Ho Chi Minh, “Message sent to the artists on the occasion of the 1951 Paintings Exhibition (December 10, 1951)”, Selected Works of Ho Chi Minh Vol. 3, Publisher: Foreign Languages Publishing House. Reproduced on &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/ho-chi-minh/works/1951/12/10.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, various debates erupted in Hanoi on the role of artists in Society in 1956, during the first meeting of the writers and artist associations, members demanded for greater freedom of expression which went against what Ho Chi Minh had earlier laid down. Two art and literature journals Nhan Van (humanism) and Gia Pham (Art Works) that supported the argument were subsequently banned. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Following year, [[Vietnam Association of Fine Arts in Hanoi]] or National Arts Association was established with 108 member headed by Thai Ba Van. These members were required to be members of the association if they wished their works to be exhibited or sold. There were no private galleries where artists can displayed their work formally. Eventually, this association was governed with official rules and regulations, members are obligated to hold one exhibition at local level annually and another at national level every 5 years. Non members were not considered artist, hence they have no opportunity to display any form of art publicly.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Between 1950 to 70s, members were paid as “art workers” for the poster designs and illustrations, among few were elites who painted paintings for state visitors. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Modern and Contemporary Vietnamese Art|last=|first=|publisher=Singapore Art Museum for symposium on modern and contemporary Vietnamese art|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realist style, which corresponded with Northern artists initial aspirations, was vital in the early days of revolution, however, due to the strict constraints by the DVR regime and decreasing subsidies, realist trend reached an apex in the 60s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vietnam Plastic and Visual Arts from 1925 to Our Time|last=|first=|publisher=Espace Méridien|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strict guidelines were attempted to established in 1962, on the productions of artists artworks, they need to portray a "National Character", subject matters were usually the countryside, battle scene, portrait of Uncle Ho.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== National Paintings ====
Anti-colonial and resistance war culminated the appropriation of “national” art. It was a period to essentially erase the impact and influence of the French. Works painted by [[Nam Sơn|Nam Son]], Tran Van Can, Nguyen Sang, Tran Dong Luon were in fact in the medium Lacquer, silk and oil medium. The 3 media, encouraged and culturally transferred by the French during colonial period were renamed as “national”.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
[[File:Tran Van Can - Painting 2.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Female Militia in the Sea Tran Van Can.jpg|left|thumb|Female Militia in the Sea 1960 Tran Van Can]]
In [[Trần Văn Cẩn|Tran Van Can]]’s Portrait painting “''Militia women of a costal region''”, the artist depicted a robust figure and confronting gaze, she is a comrade ready to face the enemy. It is a politically correct painting, filled with characteristic that fulfills the national painting.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Another theme commonly captured by artist was the landscape around Viet Bac. In the [[Diệp Minh Châu|Diep Minh Chau]]’s “Uncle Ho’s House in Viet Bac” show clear proficiency with the medium oil painting, the impressionist strokes of capturing the light through filtering leaves. 

In [[Duong Huong Minh]]’s “Hauling Up Canons” a work on lacquer captures dramatic scene of soldiers hauling heavy weapons up a steep slope. The bravery of the men eventually brought the Viet Minh their victory against the French in Bien Dien Phu.
[[File:Approaching Khe Sanh Pham Thanh Tam.jpg|left|thumb|Approaching Khe Sanh. A watercolour completed by Pham Thanh Tam in December 1967]]
Similarly, in watercolour painting painted by [[Pham Thanh Tam]] during resistance war ‘shows a clear French influence. His professors in the resistance zone were trained from the EBAI” the drawings and diary clearly contents “lyrical and poetic quality” it was regarded as ideal paintings.&lt;sup&gt;[21]&lt;/sup&gt;  

Hence, art curator Joyce Fan argues that “the realist techniques thus imparted by the French continue to manifest in the paintings with the sense of detachment and distancing, unlike the social realist use of emotive values to heighten the pathos in the imagery.”&lt;sup&gt;[22]&lt;/sup&gt; Likewise, the undeniable fact that, the intense cultural transfer during colonial period continues to influence local artist after the exit of the French. 

==== '''Propaganda Posters''' ====
[[File:South Vietnam propaganda poster.jpg|thumb|poster that depict the countryside]]
Propaganda poster painted during the period of “operation rolling thunder” in 1965 reflects a clear anti-colonial and anti-imperial messages. Likely inspired by the Soviet and Communist Chinese, they carried a political intention. Following strictly to the culture of new Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh’s concept, was to "stimulate intellectual and artistic creativity for art and cultural development".&lt;sup&gt;[23]&lt;/sup&gt;

“Culture is seen as a powerful motor of development, and cultural identity as a constant in the harmonious development of society and the individual.” &lt;sup&gt;[24]&lt;/sup&gt;

"images such as those presented in the propaganda posters and paintings of the time were key indicators of how the population was to perceive the environment, the government, and the future. the posters and paintings were sometimes the only voices the people heard, the only clues they had to knowing and how to respond."&lt;sup&gt;[25]&lt;/sup&gt;

==== '''Artists in the South''' ====
Vietnam was divided at the 17 parallel after the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] in 1954 separating themselves into the Soviet and Chinese supported North against the Southern Republic reinforced by the United Stated of America. This divided Vietnam forced some artists to fled to Saigon and continue their practices in the republic of Vietnam, most notable artist is [[Tạ Tỵ|Ta Ty]], who " considerably bolstered the South’s artistic development in the following years and profoundly contributed to the foundation of the Young Artists Association in 1966, though he chose to remain anonymous in its list of founding members due to privacy reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artradarjournal.com/2015/10/09/5-artists-to-know-from-the-vietnamese-young-artists-association/|title=5 artists to know from the Vietnamese Young Artists Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nguyen Gia Tri decided to move to Gia Dinh and eventually became the director for “[[Ecole des beaux-art in Gia Dinh]]" founded in 1954.&lt;sup&gt;[26]&lt;/sup&gt; Evident in their works, due to accessibility of information, their artworks were styled as western influenced, more eclectic, experimental, subjective and individualism. They enjoyed more freedom in the subject matters and exhibited freely until 1975.&lt;sup&gt;[27]&lt;/sup&gt;

In 1962, the first international Exhibition of Fine Arts of Saigon was held with 21 countries participating it. Southern artist encountered abstract painting for the first time. Following up, a second exhibition was planned for 1966, but unfortunately cancelled due to the increase intensity of the war. In 1966, Saigon Society of Young Artist (Hoi Hoa Si Tre Saigon) was founded campaigning to develop modern art, members include Nguyen Trung and Trinh Cung.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;

Between 1960s - 70s artists in Saigon experimented abstraction and other contemporary expressions. As noted by Vietnamese art historian Hyunh-Beattie, Southern artists did not readily accepted and took in American culture, which they deem as inferior to the French. Although Americans were heavily involved in Saigon, Beattie argues that little had influenced on the art scene in republic.

After the [[Reunification Day|reunification of Vietnam]], southern artists were sent for re-education in 1975.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; 

1976, Hanoi government merged Ho Chi Minh city and Gia Dinh National School for decorative Arts and the Saigon College of Fine Arts into Ho Chi Minh City Fine Arts College, and established Ho Chi Minh City branch of The Vietnam Association of Fine Arts.&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== '''The Period of Renewal from 1985''' ===
Artists benefited greater freedom of expression after the launch of Doi Moi Campaign. The establishment of open market allowed artist a greater outlet of creative expressions. &lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt; 

However, Nguyen Quan who was elected into the executive committee of Vietnam Association of Fine Arts and holding position as the chief editor of the Association's Magazine My Thuat (Fine Arts) was removed from his position after organizing a workshop with 30 artist in Dai Lai, North of Hanoi in 1986.&lt;sup&gt;[28]&lt;/sup&gt; The workshop was not acceptable by authority for "the retreat not only promoted individual expression and art for art's sake, it also went against what the state had instituted over the past three decades in that it allowed for artists to explore their individuality rather than represent that collective sentiments of their community."&lt;sup&gt;[29]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Contemporary Art==
Nowadays, besides working with traditional material like oil, acrylic, lacquer on wood, the younger generation of Vietnamese artists have become very active in involving different forms of arts, such as installation, performance and video art with many of them attaining international recognition for their artworks and exhibitions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://hyperallergic.com/181080/in-vietnam-contemplating-the-future-of-contemporary-art/&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Nha San Collective]] (formerly Nha San Studio) - established in 1998,  was the first artist-led, non-profit initiative to be run in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;http://theculturetrip.com/asia/vietnam/articles/the-most-influential-contemporary-art-spaces-in-vietnam/&lt;/ref&gt; Nha San studio nurtured the first generation of Vietnamese avant-garde artists emergent in the early 1990s

==Architecture==
It is believed that in prehistoric times, Vietnamese people lived in stilt-houses, as depicted on the bronze Dong Son drums.  Similar kinds of houses can still be found in Vietnam today.

When Chinese influence permeated Vietnam, [[Chinese architecture]] had a large influence on the basic structure of many types of Vietnamese buildings, mostly pagodas and temples, communal houses, houses of [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|scholar-bureaucrats]], aristocracy, and imperial palaces and quarters.  Nevertheless, these structures combined both Chinese influences and native style.
With French colonization of Vietnam in the 19th century, many French-styled buildings were constructed, including villas, government buildings, opera houses, etc.  Many of these buildings still stand in Vietnam and are one of the clearest remnants of the [[French Indochina|French colonial legacy]].

Some of Vietnam's most notable architectural structures include:

*The [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]] or (Văn Miếu): Located in [[Hanoi]], [[North Vietnam]].  It was constructed during the [[Lý Dynasty]] and dedicated to [[Confucius]] and his disciples.  It is a fine example of the elegance of Lý Dynasty architecture, although much if it is in need of repair.  The Temple of Literature is a series of courtyards, buildings and pavilions, the center of which houses the famed stone [[stele]]s.  These steles are placed on top of [[bixi (tortoise)|stone turtles]], and are inscribed with the names of doctorate candidates successful at the [[Imperial examination]].  Also within the temple lies the "Quốc Tử Giám" or National University, which functioned for approximately 700 years, from 1076 to 1779.
*[[Imperial City, Huế]]: During the reign of the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]], a new imperial citadel in [[Huế]] was built, largely based on the Chinese [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], and also called the [[Imperial City, Huế|Purple forbidden city]].  However, it still employed many obviously Vietnamese characteristics in its design.  Other imperial structures built much later, such as the outlying tomb of [[Khải Định]], used French architectural elements as well.  The tomb of [[Minh Mạng]] is often considered one of the most beautiful structures in the Huế area, situated near a vast lotus pond, its construction was not completed until after Minh Mạng's death.

The citadel formerly sprawled a vast estate, but during subsequent wars and conflicts, much of it has been destroyed and later turned into [[rice paddy|rice paddies]].  The remaining areas are currently being restored by [[UNESCO]].

*[[One Pillar Pagoda]]: The one pillar pagoda is one of the most ancient structures of [[Hanoi]], its design credited to Emperor Lý Thái Tổ.  The story goes that the emperor had longed for a son, and one day dreamed that the Goddess of Mercy was sitting on a lotus flower offering him a son. In grattitude and reverence of his dream he ordered construction of a small pagoda in the form of a lotus, overlooking a pond. The pagoda has been rebuilt countlessly due to it being destroyed and burnt in wars by opponents.
*[[Perfume Pagoda]] and the surrounding area:  The Perfume pagoda is an ancient structure in Ha Tay province, located specifically in Perfume mountain, and is the site for a yearly festival attended by hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese.  Most people reach the pagoda by taking an hour boat ride across the scenic river (passing the countryside scattered with smaller pagodas) before reaching the Perfume Pagoda itself.  Inside are a series of temples and structures, and a grotto with stairs leading to two paths: "Heaven's gate" and "Hell's gate".  Descending deep into the grotto one finds the Inner temple.

The beauty of the Perfume Pagoda and surrounding area have served as the subject in many Vietnamese poems.

==Calligraphy==
{{main|Vietnamese calligraphy}}
Calligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using [[Chinese characters]] along with [[chữ nôm]].  However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based [[quốc ngữ]], which has proven to be very popular.

In the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life.  On special occasions such as the [[Tết|Lunar New Year]], people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words).  People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at [[temple]] shrines.

==Visual arts==

===Silk painting===
[[File:Nguyen Trai.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The [[silk painting]] of [[Nguyễn Trãi]] (15th century)]]
Vietnamese [[silk painting]] is one of the most popular forms of art in Vietnam, favored for the mystical atmosphere that can be achieved with the medium.  During the 19th and 20th centuries, French influence was absorbed into Vietnamese art and the liberal and modern use of color especially began to differentiate Vietnamese silk paintings from their Chinese, Japanese and Korean counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asia-art.net/vietnam_silk.html Art of Vietnam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese silk paintings typically showcase the countryside, landscapes, pagodas, historical events or scenes of daily life.

===Woodblock prints===
[[File:Dong Ho painting - Ly Ngu vong nguyet.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Typical [[Vietnamese woodblock prints|Đông Hồ folk woodblock print]] of a carp]]
A folk art with a long history in Vietnam, [[Vietnamese woodblock prints]] have reached a level of popularity outside of Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David: ''Vietnam Past and Present: The North'' (History and culture of Hanoi and Tonkin). Chiang Mai. Cognoscenti Books, 2012. ASIN: B006DCCM9Q.&lt;/ref&gt;  Organic materials are used to make the paint, which is used on wood and pressed on paper.  The process is repeated with different colors.

===Photography===
{{See also|Photography in Vietnam}}
Photographic technology was introduced to Vietnam in the mid 19th century by French and Chinese commercial photographers.&lt;ref name="NDP"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nguyen |first1=Duc Hiep |last2=Takata |first2=Ellen |title=Photography in Vietnam from the End of the Nineteenth Century to the Start of the Twentieth |journal=Trans Asia Photography Review |date=2014 |volume=4 |issue=2 |page=1-35 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.7977573.0004.204 |accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its introduction a diverse range of photography practices have emerged such as [[fine art photography]], [[documentary photography]], and [[landscape photography]]. The development of such practices have been accelerated following [[Đổi Mới]], that has resulted in a diversification of funding for artists and increased international exposure.&lt;ref name="Zhuang"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zhuang |first1=Wubin |title="Vietnam" in Photography in Southeast Asia: A Survey |date=2016 |publisher=National University of Singapore Press |location=Singapore |isbn=978-981-4722-12-4 |page=271-313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performing arts==

===Traditional music===
{{main|Music of Vietnam}}
Traditional Vietnamese music is extremely diverse, consisting of many different styles varying from region to region.  Some of the most widely known genres include:

*[[Quan họ]]: A type of improvisational music, it is sung a cappella and has a longstanding tradition in Vietnam, used in courtship rituals.
*Imperial Court music:  Music performed in the Vietnamese court during feudalistic times.  When referring specifically to the "[[Nhã nhạc]]" form it includes court music from the [[Trần Dynasty]] on to the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]].  It features an array of instruments, featuring musicians and dancers adorned in elaborate garb.
*[[Ca trù]]: An ancient form of [[chamber music]] which originated in the imperial court.  It gradually came to be associated with a [[geisha]]-type of entertainment where talented female musicians entertained rich and powerful men, often scholars and [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|bureaucrats]] who most enjoyed the genre.  It was condemned in the 20th century by the government, being tied falsely with [[prostitution]], but recently it has seen a revival as appreciation for its cultural significance has grown.  Vietnam has completed documents to have Ca tru recognized by [[UNESCO]] as a potential [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]].

===Traditional theatre===
[[File:Gánh hát Nam Định trong lễ Tứ tuần Đại khánh của Hoàng đế Khải Định (1924).jpg|thumb|300px|Tuong theatre actors.]]
Genres include:
*[[Cải lương]]: A kind of modern folk opera originating in [[South Vietnam]], which utilizes extensive [[vibrato]] techniques.  It remains very popular in modern Vietnam when compared to other folk styles.
*[[Hát chèo]]: The most mainstream of theatre/music forms in the past, enjoyed widely by the public rather than the more obscure Ca trù which was favored more by scholars and elites.
*Hát tuồng (also known as Hát bội): A theatre form strongly influenced by [[Chinese opera]], it transitioned from being entertainment for the royal court to travelling troupes who performed for commoners and peasants, featuring many well-known [[stock characters]].

===Traditional dance===
{{main|Traditional Vietnamese dance}}
Vietnam has 54 different ethnics, each with their own traditional dance.  Among the ethnic Vietnamese majority, there are several traditional dances performed widely at festivals and other special occasions, such as the [[lion dance]].

In the imperial court there also developed throughout the centuries a series of complex court dances which require great skill. Some of the more widely known are the imperial lantern dance, fan dance, and platter dance, among others.

===Water puppetry===
[[File:Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre2.JPG|thumb|Water puppetry theatre in Hanoi]]
[[Water puppetry]] is a distinct Vietnamese art which had its origins in the 12th century. In water puppetry, a split-bamboo screen obscures puppets which stand in water and are manipulated using long poles hidden beneath the water.  Epic storylines are played out with many different characters, often depicting traditional scenes of Vietnamese life.  Despite nearly dying out in the 20th century, it has been saved by efforts of preservation and is now largely seen by tourists to Vietnam.

==Language arts==

===Literature===
{{main|Vietnamese literature}}
'''Vietnamese literature''' is [[literature]], both oral and written, created largely by [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-speaking]] people, although Francophone Vietnamese and English-speaking Vietnamese authors in Australia and the United States are counted by many critics as part of the national tradition.  For much of its history, Vietnam was dominated by China and as a result much of the written work during this period was in [[Classical Chinese]].  [[Chữ nôm]], created around the 10th century, allowed writers to compose in Vietnamese using modified Chinese characters. Although regarded as inferior to Chinese, it gradually grew in prestige.  It flourished in the 18th century when many notable Vietnamese writers and poets composed their works in ''chữ nôm'' and when it briefly became the official written script.  While the [[quốc ngữ]] script was created in the 17th century, it did not become popular outside of missionary groups until the early 20th century, when the French colonial administration mandated its use in [[French Indochina]].  By the mid-20th century, virtually all Vietnamese works of literature were composed in ''quốc ngữ''.

Some defining works of literature include ''[[The Tale of Kieu]]'' by [[Nguyễn Du]], and ''[[Lục Vân Tiên]]'' by [[Nguyễn Đình Chiểu]].

===Poetry===
Poet [[Hồ Xuân Hương]] (born during the end of the 18th century) composed much of her poetry in [[Chữ Nôm]], and most of it has been translated into [[quốc ngữ]] for modern Vietnamese.  Her poetry continues to be widely popular.  Other poets such as the famous [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin official]] [[Duong Khue]] had some of his poetry adapted into songs that are still famous today, such as the [[Ca trù]]-genre song "Hồng hồng, tuyết tuyết".

Many Vietnamese poems, along with folk "literature" in general, tends to be much more of an oral tradition - as literacy (as it is defined today) in the past was restricted mostly to scholars and the elite.

[[File:We Can Do It!.jpg|thumb|250px|J. Howard Miller's "We Can Do It!" poster from 1943]]
"'''We Can Do It!'''" is an American World War II wartime poster produced by J. Howard Miller in 1943 for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] as an inspirational image to boost worker morale.

The poster was very little seen during World War II. It was rediscovered in the early 1980s and widely reproduced in many forms, often called "We Can Do It!" but also called "[[Rosie the Riveter]]" after the iconic figure of a strong female war production worker. The "We Can Do It!" image was used to promote [[feminism]] and other political issues beginning in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006&gt;{{cite journal |first1=James J. |last1=Kimble |first2=Lester C. |last2=Olson |title=Visual Rhetoric Representing Rosie the Riveter: Myth and Misconception in J. Howard Miller's 'We Can Do It!' Poster |url= |journal=Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs |volume=9 |number=4 |date=Winter 2006 |pages=533–569|jstor=41940102}} Also available through [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1223963451.html Highbeam.]&lt;/ref&gt; The image made the cover of the [[Smithsonian (magazine)|''Smithsonian'']] magazine in 1994 and was fashioned into a US first-class mail stamp in 1999. It was incorporated in 2008 into campaign materials for several American politicians, and was reworked by an artist in 2010 to celebrate the [[Julia Gillard|first woman]] becoming [[prime minister of Australia]]. The poster is one of the ten most-requested images at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt;

After its rediscovery, observers often assumed that the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war the image was strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder.&lt;ref name=Design4Victory&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSNo6on0F8EC&amp;pg=PA78 |page=78 |title=Design for Victory: World War II posters on the American home front |first1=William L. |last1=Bird |first2=Harry R. |last2=Rubenstein |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-1-56898-140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; People have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message to remake the image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.

After she saw the ''Smithsonian'' cover image in 1994, [[Geraldine Hoff Doyle]] mistakenly said that she was the subject of the poster. Doyle thought that she had also been captured in a wartime photograph of a woman factory worker, and she innocently assumed that this photo inspired Miller's poster. Conflating her as "Rosie the Riveter", Doyle was honored by many organizations including the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame|Michigan Women's Historical Center and Hall of Fame]]. However, in 2015, the woman in the wartime photograph was identified as then 20-year-old [[Naomi Parker Fraley|Naomi Parker]], working in early 1942 before Doyle had graduated from high school. Doyle's notion that the photograph inspired the poster cannot be proved or disproved, so neither Doyle nor Parker can be confirmed as the model for "We Can Do It!"

==Background==
[[File:TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT - KEEP `EM FIRING - NARA - 515856.jpg|thumb|upright|A propaganda poster from 1942 encouraging unity between labor and management of [[General Motors|GM]]]]
After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the U.S. government called upon manufacturers to produce greater amounts of war goods. The workplace atmosphere at large factories was often tense because of resentment built up between management and labor unions throughout the 1930s. Directors of companies such as [[General Motors]] (GM) sought to minimize past friction and encourage teamwork. In response to a rumored public relations campaign by the [[United Auto Workers]] union, GM quickly produced a propaganda poster in 1942 showing both labor and management rolling up their sleeves, aligned toward maintaining a steady rate of war production. The poster read, "Together We Can Do It!" and "Keep 'Em Firing!"&lt;ref name=BirdRubenstein58&gt;Bird/Rubenstein 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gaRRtWEH2pgC&amp;pg=PA58 p. 58].&lt;/ref&gt; In creating such posters, corporations wished to increase production by tapping popular pro-war sentiment, with the ultimate goal of preventing the government from exerting greater control over production.&lt;ref name=BirdRubenstein58/&gt;

===J. Howard Miller===
J. Howard Miller was an American [[graphic artist]]. He painted posters during World War II in support of the war effort, among them the famous "We Can Do It!" poster  Aside from the iconic poster, Miller remains largely unknown.&lt;ref name="Weatherford2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Doris Weatherford|title=American Women during World War II: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9GLAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1181|date=16 October 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-20189-0|pages=1181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little has been written about Miller's life, and the year of his birth and death are uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Wong|first1=Hannah Wai Ling|type=M.A.|title=A Riveting "Rosie": J.

Miller studied at the [[Art Institute of Pittsburgh]], graduating in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sUP0B83GMMC&amp;pg=PA16 |page=16 |first1=Jacquelyn Felix |last1=Fisher |first2=E.

His work came to the attention of the Westinghouse Company (later, the Westinghouse War Production Co-Ordinating Committee), and he was hired to create a series of posters.  The posters were sponsored by the company's internal War Production Co-Ordinating Committee, one of the hundreds of labor-management committees organized under the supervision of the national War Production Board.

===Westinghouse Electric===
In 1942, Miller was hired by Westinghouse Electric's internal War Production Coordinating Committee, through an advertising agency, to create a series of posters to display to the company's workers.&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7h4T1DWEECUC&amp;pg=PA62 |page=62 |title=Smokey, Rosie, and You! |first1=David A. |last1=Ehrlich |first2=Alan R. |last2=Minton |first3=Diane |last3=Stoy |publisher=Hillcrest Publishing Group |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-934248-33-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the poster project was to raise worker morale, to reduce absenteeism, to direct workers' questions to management, and to lower the likelihood of labor unrest or a factory strike. Each of the more than 42 posters designed by Miller was displayed in the factory for two weeks, then replaced by the next one in the series. Most of the posters featured men; they emphasized traditional roles for men and women. One of the posters pictured a smiling male manager with the words "Any Questions About Your Work?&amp;nbsp;... Ask your Supervisor."&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Design4Victory/&gt;

==Rosie the Riveter==
{{Main article|Rosie the Riveter}}
During World War II, the "We Can Do It!" poster was not connected to the 1942 song "Rosie the Riveter", nor to the widely seen [[Norman Rockwell]] painting called ''Rosie the Riveter'' that appeared on the cover of the [[Memorial Day]] issue of the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', May 29, 1943. The Westinghouse poster was not associated with any of the women nicknamed "Rosie" who came forward to promote women working for war production on the home front. Rather, after being displayed for two weeks in February 1943 to some Westinghouse factory workers, it disappeared for nearly four decades.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=McLellan |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-geraldine-hoff-doyle-20101231,0,1376340.story |title=Geraldine Hoff Doyle dies at 86; inspiration behind a famous wartime poster |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YjbR9EXABPEC&amp;pg=PA606 |page=606 |title=World War II and the Postwar Years in America: A Historical and Cultural Encyclopedia |volume=1 |first1=William H. |last1=Young |first2=Nancy K. |last2=Young |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-313-35652-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other "Rosie" images prevailed, often photographs of actual workers. The [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] geared up for a massive nationwide advertising campaign to sell the war, but "We Can Do It!" was not part of it.&lt;ref name=Secrets2011/&gt;

Rockwell's emblematic ''Rosie the Riveter'' painting was loaned by the ''Post'' to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] for use in posters and campaigns promoting [[war bond]]s. Following the war, the Rockwell painting gradually sank from public memory because it was copyrighted; all of Rockwell's paintings were vigorously defended by his estate after his death. This protection resulted in the original painting gaining value—it sold for nearly $5&amp;nbsp;million in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5wukQLkavoC&amp;pg=PA399 |page=399 |title=American Women during World War II: an encyclopedia |last=Weatherford |first=Doris |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-99475-0 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the lack of protection for the "We Can Do It!" image is one of the reasons it experienced a rebirth.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

Ed Reis, a volunteer historian for Westinghouse, noted that the original image was not shown to female [[riveter]]s during the war, so the recent association with "Rosie the Riveter" was unjustified. Rather, it was targeted at women who were making helmet liners out of [[Micarta]]. Reis joked that the woman in the image was more likely to have been named "Molly the Micarta Molder or Helen the Helmet Liner Maker."&lt;ref name=CushingDrescher2009/&gt;

==Rediscovery==
[[File:We Can Do It water bottles.jpg|thumb|left|An example of commercial use on a pair of vending machines for bottled water]]
In 1982, the "We Can Do It!" poster was reproduced in a magazine article, "Poster Art for Patriotism's Sake", a [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post Magazine'']] article about posters in the collection of the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Patricia |last=Brennan |title=Poster Art for Patriotism's Sake |journal=[[The Washington Post|Washington Post Magazine]] |date=May 23, 1982 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years, the poster was re-appropriated to promote [[feminism]]. Feminists saw in the image an embodiment of female empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlxHgYqgDswC&amp;pg=PA601 |page=601 |chapter=Rosie the Riveter |last=Endres |first=Kathleen L. |title=American icons: an encyclopedia of the people, places, and things |editor=Dennis Hall, Susan G. Hall |publisher=Greenwood |year=2006 |volume=1 |isbn=978-0-275-98429-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "We" was understood to mean "We Women", uniting all women in a sisterhood fighting against gender inequality. This was very different from the poster's 1943 use to control employees and to discourage labor unrest.&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Secrets2011/&gt; History professor Jeremiah Axelrod commented on the image's combination of femininity with the "masculine (almost macho) composition and body language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Diederik Oostdijk, Markha G.

[[Smithsonian (magazine)|''Smithsonian'']] magazine put the image on its cover in March 1994, to invite the viewer to read a featured article about wartime posters. The [[US Postal Service]] created a 33¢ stamp in February 1999 based on the image, with the added words "Women Support War Effort".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosietheriveter.org/hilite.htm |title=1999–2000 Highlights |work=Rosie The Riveter Memorial Project |location=Richmond, California |date=April 2003 |publisher=Rosie the Riveter Trust |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usstampgallery.com/view.php?id=1352aaaa8d4396c687fbde59ce0e09035b7c418a |title=Women Support War Effort |publisher=United States Postal Service |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about.usps.com/publications/pub512.pdf |title=Women On Stamps (Publication 512) |date=April 2003 |publisher=United States Postal Service |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Westinghouse poster from 1943 was put on display at the [[National Museum of American History]], part of the exhibit showing items from the 1930s and '40s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/exhibitions/small_exhibition.cfm?exkey=143&amp;key=1267&amp;pagekey=246 |title=Treasures of American History: The Great Depression and World War II |publisher=National Museum of American History |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, former war worker [[Geraldine Doyle|Geraldine Hoff Doyle]] came across an article in ''[[AARP The Magazine|Modern Maturity]]'' magazine which showed a wartime photograph of a young woman working at a lathe, and she assumed that the photograph was taken of her in mid-to-late 1942 when she was working briefly in a factory. Ten years later, Doyle saw the "We Can Do It!" poster on the front of the [[Smithsonian (magazine)|''Smithsonian'']] magazine and assumed the poster was an image of herself. Without intending to profit from the connection, Doyle decided that the 1942 wartime photograph had inspired Miller to create the poster, making Doyle herself the model for the poster.&lt;ref name=Kimble2016&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rosie's Secret Identity, or, How to Debunk a Woozle by Walking Backward through the Forest of Visual Rhetoric |last=Kimble |first=James J. |date=Summer 2016 |journal=Rhetoric and Public Affairs |volume=19 |number=2 |pages=245–274 |issn=1094-8392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Doyle was widely credited as the inspiration for Miller's poster.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name="nbcnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chuck |first=Elizabeth |title=Geraldine Doyle, inspiration for 'Rosie the Riveter,' dies at 86 |url=http://fieldnotes.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/12/30/5738254-geraldine-doyle-inspiration-for-rosie-the-riveter-dies-at-86 |accessdate=July 1, 2015 |work=Field Notes from NBC News |date=December 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101123212/http://fieldnotes.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/12/30/5738254-geraldine-doyle-inspiration-for-rosie-the-riveter-dies-at-86 |archivedate=January 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2010&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/us/30doyle.html |title=Geraldine Doyle, Iconic Face of World War II, Dies at 86 |date=December 29, 2010 |last=Williams |first=Timothy |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|last=Memmot |first=Mark |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/12/30/132484640/michigan-woman-who-inspired-wwii-rosie-poster-has-died |title=Michigan Woman Who Inspired WWII 'Rosie' Poster Has Died |publisher=NPR |date=December 31, 2010 |accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Michigan History Magazine |volume=78 |pages=54–55 |year=1994 |title=Geraldine Hoff Doyle |last=Schimpf |first=Sheila }}&lt;/ref&gt; From an archive of [[ACME Newspictures|Acme news photographs]], Professor James J.

Although many publications have repeated Doyle's unsupported assertion that the wartime photograph inspired Miller's poster,&lt;ref name=Kimble2016/&gt; Westinghouse historian Charles A.

==Legacy==
[[File:Rosify Yourself Facebook app.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The "We Can Do It!" poster was used by the [[Ad Council]] for its 70th anniversary celebration, through a Facebook app called "Rosify Yourself".]]
Today, the image has become very widely known, far beyond its narrowly defined purpose during WWII. It has adorned T-shirts, tattoos, coffee cups and refrigerator magnets—so many different products that the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' called it the "most over-exposed" souvenir item available in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt; It was used in 2008 by some of the various regional campaigners working to elect [[Sarah Palin]], [[Ron Paul]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=CushingDrescher2009/&gt; [[Michelle Obama]] was worked into the image by some attendees of the 2010 [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]].&lt;ref name=Secrets2011&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://lisawadedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/sharp-wade-2011-secrets-of-a-feminist-icon.pdf |last1=Sharp |first1=Gwen |last2=Wade |first2=Lisa |date=January 4, 2011 |title=Sociological Images: Secrets of a feminist icon |journal=Contexts |volume=10 |number=2 |pages=82–83 |issn=1536-5042}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image has been employed by corporations such as [[Clorox]] who used it in advertisements for household cleaners, the pictured woman provided in this instance with a wedding ring on her left hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2007/10/22/trivializing-womens-power/ |last=Wade |first=Lisa |title=Sociological Images: Trivializing Women's Power |date=October 22, 2007 |work=The Society Page |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parodies of the image have included famous women, men, animals and fictional characters.

After [[Julia Gillard]] became the first female [[prime minister of Australia]] in June 2010, a [[Melbourne]] [[street art]]ist calling himself Phoenix pasted Gillard's face into a new monochrome version of the "We Can Do It!" poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/phoenixthestreetartist/4748630334/ |date=June 29, 2010 |title=We Can Do It! |author=Phoenix |publisher=[[Flickr]] |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[AnOther Magazine]]'' published a photograph of the poster taken on [[Hosier Lane, Melbourne]], in July 2010, showing that the original "War Production Co-ordinating Committee" mark in the lower right had been replaced with a [[Uniform resource locator|URL]] pointing to Phoenix's [[Flickr]] photostream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.anothermag.com/current/view/348/Australian_President_Julia_Gillard |title=Australian President, Julia Gillard |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:v3jSEN5VM78J:www.anothermag.com/current/view/348/Australian_President_Julia_Gillard+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us |archivedate=September 27, 2012 |date=July 27, 2010 |journal=[[AnOther Magazine]] |first=David |last=Hellqvist |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://damadesign.tumblr.com/post/866607274/julia-gillard-former-president-of-australia-as |date=July 8, 2010 |title=Julia Gillard |author=Dama Design |publisher=[[Tumblr]] |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/phoenixthestreetartist/5523564006/ |date=March 12, 2011 |title=We Can Do It! |author=Phoenix |publisher=[[Flickr]] |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Phoenix produced a color version which stated "She Did It!" in the lower right,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/phoenixthestreetartist/4759196620/in/photostream// |date=July 2, 2010 |title=We Can Do It! |author=Phoenix |publisher=[[Flickr]] |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; then in January 2012 he pasted "Too Sad" diagonally across the poster to represent his disappointment with developments in Australian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/phoenixthestreetartist/6808410971/ |date=January 23, 2012 |title=She Did It!

Geraldine Doyle died in December 2010. ''[[Utne Reader]]'' went ahead with their scheduled January–February 2011 cover image: a parody of "We Can Do It!" featuring [[Marge Simpson]] raising her right hand in a fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utne.com/table-of-contents-january-february-2011.aspx |title=Table of Contents |date=January–February 2011 |work=Utne Reader |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of the magazine expressed regret at the passing of Doyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://utnereader.tumblr.com/post/2585298665 |title=untitled |work=Utne Reader editorial blog |date=January 3, 2011 |publisher=Utne Reader |accessdate=January 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623045811/http://utnereader.tumblr.com/post/2585298665 |archivedate=June 23, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] (3D) image of "We Can Do It!" was created for the closing credits of the 2011 superhero film ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''. The image served as the background for the title card of English actress [[Hayley Atwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Captain America: The First Avenger |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/captain-america-the-first-avenger/ |work=Art of the Title |first=Lola |last=Landekic |date=August 30, 2011 |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ad Council]] claimed the poster was developed in 1942 by its precursor, the War Advertising Committee, as part of a "Women in War Jobs" campaign, helping to bring "over two million women" into war production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adcouncil.org/timeline.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216085055/http://www.adcouncil.org/timeline.html |title=The Story of the Ad Council |publisher=Ad Council |archivedate=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adcouncil.org/About-Us/Frequently-Asked-Questions |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Ad Council |accessdate=September 24, 2012 |quote=Working in tandem with the Office of War Information, the Ad Council created campaigns such as Buy War Bonds, Plant Victory Gardens, 'Loose Lips Sink Ships,' and Rosie the Riveter's 'We Can Do it.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Conlon&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peggy-conlon/happy-birthday-ad-council_b_1269338.html |last=Conlon |first=Peggy |title=Happy Birthday Ad Council!

The [[Facebook Platform|Facebook app]] was called "Rosify Yourself", referring to Rosie the Riveter; it allowed viewers to upload images of their faces to be incorporated into the "We Can Do It!" poster, then saved to be shared with friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.helpsgood.com/post/17615327499/helpsgood-develops-rosify-yourself-app-for-ad?ad313a00 |title=HelpsGood Develops 'Rosify Yourself' App for Ad Council's 70th Birthday |date=February 2012 |publisher=HelpsGood |accessdate=September 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126165316/http://www.helpsgood.com/post/17615327499/helpsgood-develops-rosify-yourself-app-for-ad?ad313a00 |archivedate=January 26, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ad Council President and CEO Peggy Conlon posted her own "Rosified" face on ''[[Huffington Post]]'' in an article she wrote about the group's 70-year history.&lt;ref name=Conlon/&gt; The staff of the television show [[Today (U.S. TV program)|''Today'']] posted two "Rosified" images on their website, using the faces of news anchors [[Matt Lauer]] and [[Ann Curry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://allday.today.com/_news/2012/02/13/10395999-plaza-sign-of-the-day-matt-as-rosie-the-riveter |title=Plaza sign of the day: Matt as Rosie the Riveter |last=Veres |first=Steve |date=February 13, 2012 |work=Today |publisher=MSN Allday Today |accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Seton Hall University]] professor James J.

'''Yaddo''' is an [[artists' community]] located on a {{convert|400|acre|ha|adj=on}} estate in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]].  Its mission is "to nurture the creative process by providing an opportunity for artists to work without interruption in a supportive environment."&lt;ref name = "History"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://yaddo.org/yaddo/history.shtml | title = Yaddo | contribution = History}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On March&amp;nbsp;11, 2013 it was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/americas-great-outdoors-secretary-salazar-director-jarvis-designate-13-new-national-historic-landmarks.cfm|title=New Sites Recognize More Complete Story of America, including Significant Latino, African American and Indian Sites|publisher=US Department of the interior|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It offers residencies to artists working in choreography, film, literature, musical composition, painting, performance art, photography, printmaking, sculpture, and video. Collectively, artists who have worked at Yaddo have won 66 [[Pulitzer Prizes]], 27 [[MacArthur Fellowships]], 61 [[National Book Awards]], 24 [[National Book Critics Circle Award]]s, 108 [[Rome Prize]]s, 49 [[Whiting Writers' Award]]s, a Nobel Prize ([[Saul Bellow]], who won the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction and [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1976), and countless other honors.&lt;ref name = "History" /&gt; Yaddo is included in the [[Union Avenue Historic District (Saratoga Springs, New York)|Union Avenue Historic District]].

==History==
The estate was purchased in 1881 by the financier [[Spencer Trask]] and his wife, the writer [[Katrina Trask]]. The first mansion on the property burned down in 1893, and the Trasks then built the current house.  Yaddo is a [[neologism]] invented by one of the Trask children and was meant to rhyme with "shadow".&lt;ref name="YaddoSubstance"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760139,00.html |title= Yaddo and Substance |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date= September 5, 1938 | quote= Creating at Yaddo last week, at mid-season of the colony's twelfth year &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;1938&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, was a typical group of writers and artists who have given substance to Katrina's vision. But whether or not they fit her romantic conception was an open question. By contrast with aristocratic Katrina and the elegant surroundings she provided, most of the season's 27 guests stood out in striking left-wing contrast: Poet [[Kenneth Fearing]] ''(Angel Arms, Poems),''  Critic [[Newton Arvin]] ''(Hawthorne),''  Novelists [[Joseph Vogel (writer)|Joseph Vogel]] ''(At Madame Bonnard's),''  [[Leonard Ehrlich]] ''(God's Angry Man),''  [[Henry Roth]] ''(Call It Sleep),''  [[Daniel Fuchs]] ''(Low Company).'' &lt;br /&gt; "One of the show places of the U.S., Yaddo is a {{convert|500|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate with pine groves, vast lawns, artificial lakes with ducks, famous rose gardens, and white marble fountains. The name Yaddo was a baby pronunciation given by the Trask children (all four of whom died in childhood) to The Shadows, a famous [[Public house#Inns|inn]] formerly on the site of the Trask estate, where the Trasks had spent their summers. It was one of the dozen places where [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]] was supposed to have written ''[[The Raven]]'', and Katrina said it inspired her own poetry. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artists' colony===
In 1900, after the premature deaths of the Trasks' four children,&lt;ref name= "YaddoSubstance"/&gt; Spencer Trask decided to turn the estate into an artists' retreat as a gift to his wife.  He did this with the financial assistance of philanthropist [[George Foster Peabody]].  The first artists arrived in 1926. The success of Yaddo encouraged Spencer and Katrina later to donate land for a working women's retreat center as well, known as [[Wiawaka Holiday House]], at the request of Mary Wiltsie Fuller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.wiawaka.org/history.html | title = History | publisher = Wiawaka | accessdate = June 9, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 during the [[McCarthy Era]], a news story accurately accused writer [[Agnes Smedley]] of spying for the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Price, ''The Lives of Agnes Smedley'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), 5-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Smedley had traveled with [[Mao Zedong]] to report on the Chinese Communist Revolution and, beginning in 1943, had spent five years at Yaddo. Poet [[Robert Lowell]] pushed the Board of Directors to oust Yaddo's director, Elizabeth Ames, who was being questioned by the [[FBI]].  Ames was eventually exonerated of all charges but learned from the investigation that her assistant Mary Townsend was an FBI informant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://exhibitions.nypl.org/exhibits/yaddo/contention/3 | title = The Lowell Affair: Yaddo's Red Scare | publisher = NYPL}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.poetryfoundation.org/journal/feature.html?id=178893 | title = Deeply and mysteriously implicated | first = Carla | last = Blumenkranz | publisher = Poetry Foundation}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ames remained director until her retirement in 1969, having overseen the Yaddo community from its creation in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;"Elizabeth Ames, Creator of Yaddo, Upstate Cultural Haven, Dies at 92," ''New York Times'', March 30, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Ames was succeeded by Newman E. Waite who served as president from 1969 until 1977 when Curtis Harnack assumed the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://archives.nypl.org/mss/4795 | title = Guide to the Yaddo records| publisher = NYPL}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary critic and eventual Yaddo board member [[Louis Kronenberger]] wrote in his memoir that to call Yaddo "a mixture of some of the most attractive, enjoyable, generous-minded people and of others who were weird, megalomaniac, intransigent, pugnacious is only to say that it has housed and nourished most of the finest talents in the arts of the past forty-odd years—the immensely fruitful years of Elizabeth Ames's directorship."&lt;ref&gt;Louis Kronenberger, ''No Whippings, No Gold Watches'' (Boston: Little Brown, 1970), 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In literature ===
The retreat was the partial setting of [[Jonathan Ames]]' book ''Wake Up Sir!'' (2004).

''Dagger of the Mind'' (1941), a novel by 1930s Yaddo resident Kenneth Fearing, takes place in Demarest Hall, an art colony modeled after Yaddo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fearing|first=Kenneth|title=The Collected Poems of Kenneth Fearing|year=2004|publisher=Indiana Press University|location=Indiana|isbn=0943373255|page=XVIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent years ===
In May 2005, vandals, using [[paintball]] guns, damaged two of the Four Seasons statues, the Poet's Bench, a fountain, and pathways with blue paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kinney|first = Jim|newspaper=The Saratogian|date=May 18, 2005|accessdate = January 1, 2011|title=Vandals Strike Yaddo Gardens|url=http://www.saratogian.com/articles/2005/05/18/todays_stories/14544796.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repairs cost $1,400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Kinney|first=Jim|title=Yaddo Vandals' Damage Undone|date = May 21, 2006|accessdate = January 1, 2011|url=http://www.saratogian.com/articles/2005/05/21/todays_stories/14567030.txt|newspaper=The Saratogian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entering its second century, Yaddo accepts contributions to its endowment and underwriting for specific projects to ensure that the artists' community will always be a place of inspiration. During the Centennial Gift Campaign, Yaddo received large contributions from [[Spencer Trask &amp; Company]] and [[Kevin Kimberlin]], the firm's current chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://albany.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/1998/12/14/daily21.html|date = December 17, 1998|accessdate = January 1, 2011|title=$1M gift received by Yaddo|newspaper=The Business Review|location=Albany, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[Patricia Highsmith]] bequeathed her estate, valued at $3 million, to the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barron|first1=James|last2=Martin|first2=Douglas|title=Public Lives; Here and There|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/18/nyregion/public-lives-here-and-there.html?src=pm|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 18, 1998|accessdate = December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Willcox|first1=Kathleen|title=Patricia Highsmith, Yaddo and America|url=http://www.saratogaliving.com/featured/patricia-highsmith-yaddo-and-america|work=Saratoga Living|date=June 1, 2016|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Yaddo President is Elaina Richardson.

== Facilities and gardens ==
[[File:YaddoPergola.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Pergola]] in Yaddo's gardens, photographed c. 1900–20]]
Yaddo's gardens are modeled after the classical Italian gardens the Trasks had visited in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yaddo.org/yaddo-gardens/about/ Yaddo Gardens website].&lt;/ref&gt; The Four Seasons statues were acquired and installed in the garden in 1909.&lt;ref name="dailygazette.com"&gt;[https://dailygazette.com/article/2017/01/01/at-yaddo-statues-truly-are-for-all-seasons "At Yaddo, statues truly are for all seasons,"] ''Daily Gazette'' [[Schenectady, New York]], January 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many statues and sculptures located within the estate, including a sundial that bears the inscription, "Hours fly, Flowers die, New days, New ways, Pass by, Love stays."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theotherpages.org/poems/vandyke1.html Poetry of [[Henry van Dyke]]].  The poem was written specifically for the Yaddo Garden.&lt;/ref&gt; While visitors are not admitted to the main mansion or artists' residences, they may visit the gardens.&lt;ref name="dailygazette.com"/&gt;
