      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7856">{{short description|mathematical logic concept}}
In [[mathematical logic]], a [[formula (mathematical logic)|formula]] is said to be '''absolute''' if it has the same [[truth value]] in each of some class of [[structure (mathematical logic)|structures]] (also called models).  Theorems about absoluteness typically establish relationships between the absoluteness of formulas and their syntactic form. 

There are two weaker forms of partial absoluteness. If the truth of a formula in each [[substructure (mathematics)|substructure]] ''N'' of a structure ''M'' follows from its truth in ''M'', the formula is '''downward absolute'''. If the truth of a formula in a structure ''N'' implies its truth in each structure ''M'' extending ''N'', the formula is '''upward absolute'''.

Issues of absoluteness are particularly important in [[set theory]] and [[model theory]], fields where multiple structures are considered simultaneously. In model theory, several basic results and definitions are motivated by absoluteness. In set theory, the issue of which properties of sets are absolute is well studied. The '''Shoenfield absoluteness theorem''', due to Joseph Shoenfield (1961), establishes the absoluteness of a large class of formulas between a model of set theory and its [[constructible universe]], with important methodological consequences. The absoluteness of [[large cardinal axiom]]s is also studied, with positive and negative results known.

== In model theory ==

In [[model theory]], there are several general results and definitions related to absoluteness. A fundamental example of downward absoluteness is that universal sentences (those with only universal quantifiers) that are true in a structure are also true in every substructure of the original structure. Conversely, existential sentences are upward absolute from a structure to any structure containing it. 

Two structures are defined to be [[elementarily equivalent]] if they agree about the truth value of all sentences in their shared language, that is, if all sentences in their language are absolute between the two structures. A theory is defined to be [[model complete]] if whenever ''M''  and ''N'' are models of the theory and ''M'' is a substructure of ''N'', then ''M'' is an [[elementary substructure]] of ''N''.

== In set theory ==

A major part of modern [[set theory]] involves the study of different models of ZF and ZFC. It is crucial for the study of such models to know which properties of a set are absolute to different models. It is common to begin with a fixed model of set theory and only consider other [[transitive set|transitive]] models containing the same ordinals as the fixed model. 

Certain properties are absolute to all transitive models of set theory, including the following (see Jech (2003 sec. I.12) and Kunen (1980 sec. IV.3)). 
* ''x'' is the empty set.
* ''x'' is an ordinal.
* ''X'' is a finite ordinal. 
* ''x'' = ω.
* ''x'' is (the graph of) a function.

Other properties, such as countability, are not absolute. 

=== Failure of absoluteness for countability ===

[[Skolem's paradox]] is the seeming contradiction that on the one hand, the set of real numbers is uncountable (and this is provable from ZFC, or even from a small finite subsystem ZFC' of ZFC), while on the other hand there are countable transitive models of ZFC' (this is provable in ZFC), and the set of real numbers in such a model will be a countable set. The paradox can be resolved by noting that countability is not absolute to submodels of a particular model of ZFC. It is possible that a set ''X'' is countable in a model of set theory but uncountable in a submodel containing ''X'', because the submodel may contain no bijection between ''X'' and ω, while the definition of countability is the existence of such a bijection. The [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], when applied to ZFC, shows that this situation does occur.

=== Shoenfield's absoluteness theorem ===

'''Shoenfield's absoluteness theorem''' shows that &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_2&lt;/math&gt; sentences in the [[analytical hierarchy]] are absolute between a model ''V'' of ZF and the [[constructible universe]] ''L'' of the model, when interpreted as statements about the natural numbers in each model. The theorem can be relativized to allow the sentence to use sets of natural numbers from ''V'' as parameters, in which case ''L'' must be replaced by the smallest submodel containing those parameters and all the ordinals.  The theorem has corollaries that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_3&lt;/math&gt; sentences are upward absolute (if such a sentence holds in ''L'' then it holds in ''V'') and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_3&lt;/math&gt; sentences are downward absolute (if they hold in ''V'' then they hold in ''L''). Because any two transitive models of set theory with the same ordinals have the same constructible universe, Shoenfield's theorem shows that two such models must agree about the truth of all &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_2&lt;/math&gt; sentences. 

One consequence of Shoenfield's theorem relates to the [[axiom of choice]]. Gödel proved that the constructible universe ''L'' always satisfies ZFC, including the axiom of choice, even when ''V'' is only assumed to satisfy ZF. Shoenfield's theorem shows that if there is a model of ZF in which a given &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_3&lt;/math&gt; statement φ is false, then φ is also false in the constructible universe of that model. In contrapositive, this means that if ZFC proves a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_3&lt;/math&gt; sentence then that sentence is also provable in ZF. The same argument can be applied to any other principle which always holds in the constructible universe, such as the combinatorial principle [[Diamond principle|◊]]. Even if these principles are independent of ZF, each of their &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_3&lt;/math&gt; consequences is already provable in ZF. In particular, this includes any of their consequences that can be expressed in the (first order) language of [[Peano arithmetic]].

Shoenfield's theorem also shows that there are limits to the independence results that can be obtained by [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]]. In particular, any sentence of Peano arithmetic is absolute to transitive models of set theory with the same ordinals. Thus it is not possible to use forcing to change the truth value of arithmetical sentences, as forcing does not change the ordinals of the model to which it is applied. Many famous open problems, such as the [[Riemann hypothesis]] and the [[P = NP problem]], can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_2&lt;/math&gt; sentences (or sentences of lower complexity), and thus cannot be proven independent of ZFC by forcing.

=== Large cardinals ===

There are certain [[large cardinal]]s that cannot exist in the [[constructible universe]] (''L'') of any model of set theory. Nevertheless, the constructible universe contains all the ordinal numbers that the original model of set theory contains. This "paradox" can be resolved by noting that the defining properties of some large cardinals are not absolute to submodels. 

One example of such a nonabsolute large cardinal axiom is for [[measurable cardinal]]s; for an ordinal to be a measurable cardinal there must exist another set (the measure) satisfying certain properties. It can be shown that no such measure is constructible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9608">The '''Anna Karenina principle''' states that a deficiency in any [[Limiting factor|one of a number of factors]] dooms an endeavor to failure. Consequently, a successful endeavor (subject to this principle) is one where every possible deficiency has been avoided.

The name of the principle derives from [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s book ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', which begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words: in order to be happy, a family must be successful on ''each and every one'' of ''a'' ''range'' of criteria e.g.: sexual attraction, money issues, parenting, religion, in-laws. Failure on only ''one'' of these counts leads to ''un''happiness. Thus there are more ways for a family to be unhappy than happy.

In [[statistics]], the term ''Anna Karenina principle'' is used to describe [[Statistical hypothesis testing|significance test]]s: there are any number of ways in which a dataset may violate the [[null hypothesis]] and only one in which all the assumptions are satisfied.

==Examples==

===Failed domestication===
The Anna Karenina principle was popularized by [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]''.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS"&gt;{{cite book |author=Diamond, J. |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |date=March 1997 |isbn=0-393-03891-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond uses this principle to illustrate why so few wild animals have been successfully domesticated throughout history, as a deficiency in any one of a great number of factors can render a species undomesticable. Therefore, all successfully domesticated species are not so because of a particular positive trait, but because of a lack of any number of possible negative traits. In chapter 9, six groups of reasons for failed domestication of animals are defined:

*'''Diet''' – To be a candidate for domestication, a species must be easy to feed. Finicky eaters make poor candidates. Non-finicky omnivores make the best candidates.
*'''Growth rate''' – The animal must grow fast enough to be economically feasible. Elephant farmers, for example, would wait perhaps 12 years for their herd to reach adult size.
*'''Captive breeding''' – The species must breed well in captivity. Species having [[mating]] rituals prohibiting breeding in a farm-like environment make poor candidates for domestication. These rituals could include the need for privacy or long, protracted mating chases.
*'''Disposition''' – Some species are too ill-tempered to be good candidates for domestication. Farmers must not be at risk of life or injury every time they enter the animal pen. The [[zebra]] is of special note in the book, as it was recognized by local cultures and Europeans alike as extremely valuable and useful to domesticate, but it proved impossible to tame. Horses in Africa proved to be susceptible to disease and attack by a wide variety of animals, while the very characteristics that made the zebra hardy and survivable in the harsh environment of Africa also made it fiercely independent.
*'''Tendency to panic''' – Species are genetically predisposed to react to danger in different ways. A species that immediately takes flight is a poor candidate for domestication. A species that freezes, or mingles with the herd for cover in the face of danger, is a good candidate. [[Deer]] in North America have proven almost impossible to domesticate and have difficulty breeding in captivity. Horses, however, immediately thrived from the time they were introduced to North America in the 16th century.
*'''Social structure''' – Species of lone, independent animals make poor candidates. A species that has a strong, well defined [[social hierarchy]] is more likely to be domesticated. A species that can [[imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] on a human as the head of the hierarchy is best. Different social groups must also be tolerant of one another.

==Ecological risk assessment==
{{See also|Liebig's law of the minimum}}

Moore describes applications of the ''Anna Karenina principle'' in [[ecology]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Successful ecological risk assessments are all alike; every unsuccessful ecological risk assessment fails in its own way. Tolstoy posited a similar analogy in his novel Anna Karenina : "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." By that, Tolstoy meant that for a marriage to be happy, it had to succeed in several key aspects. Failure on even one of these aspects, and the marriage is doomed . . . the Anna Karenina principle also applies to ecological risk assessments involving multiple stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Dwayne R.J.|title=The Principle Applied to Ecological Risk Assessments of Multiple Stressors|journal=Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal|date=March 2001|volume=7|issue=2|pages=231–237|doi=10.1080/20018091094349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aristotle's version==

Much earlier, ''[[Aristotle]]'' states the same principle in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Book 2):&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.2.ii.html Nicomachean Ethics], Translated by [[W. D. Ross]], Oxford University Press, Oxford; Revised edition (11 Jun 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, it is possible to fail in many ways (for evil belongs to the class of the unlimited, as the Pythagoreans conjectured, and good to that of the limited), while to succeed is possible only in one way (for which reason also one is easy and the other difficult – to miss the mark easy, to hit it difficult); for these reasons also, then, excess and defect are characteristic of vice, and the mean of virtue; For men are good in but one way, but bad in many.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Order in chaos of maladaptation==
Many experiments and observations of groups of humans, animals, trees, grassy plants, stockmarket prices, and changes in the banking sector proved the modified Anna Karenina principle.

&lt;blockquote&gt;By studying the dynamics of correlation and variance in many systems facing external, or environmental, factors, we can typically, even before obvious symptoms of crisis appear, predict when one might occur, as correlation between individuals increases, and, at the same time, variance (and volatility) goes up.... '''All well-adapted systems are alike, all non-adapted systems experience maladaptation in their own way,... But in the chaos of maladaptation, there is an order'''. It seems, paradoxically, that as systems become more different they actually become more correlated within limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/media-centre/non-public/anna-karenina-principle-explains-bodily-stress-and-stockmarket-crashes Anna Karenina principle explains bodily stress and stockmarket crashes], University of Leicester, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This effect is proved for many systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=Alexander N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=Elena V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=Tatiana A.|title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|date=August 2010|volume=389|issue=16|pages=3193–3217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003_Correlations_Risk_and_Crisis_From_Physiology_to_Finance|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|arxiv=0905.0129|bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the adaptation of healthy people to a change in climate conditions to the analysis of fatal outcomes in oncological and cardiological clinics. The same effect is found in the stock market. The applicability of these two statistical indicators of stress, simultaneous increase of variance and correlations, for diagnosis of [[social stress]] in large groups was examined in the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;Rybnikov, S.R.; Rybnikova, N.A.; Portnov, B.A. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065_Public_fears_in_Ukrainian_society_Are_crises_predictable Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?] Psychology &amp; Developing Societies 29(1):98-123· March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==General mathematical backgrounds==
[[Vladimir Arnold]] in his book ''Catastrophe Theory'' describes "The Principle of Fragility of Good Things" which in a sense supplements the Principle of Anna Karenina: good systems must meet simultaneously a number of requirements; therefore, they are more fragile:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... for systems belonging to the singular part of the stability boundary a small change of the parameters is more likely to send the system into the unstable region than into the stable region. This is a manifestation of a general principle stating that all good things (e.g. stability) are more fragile than bad things. It seems that in good situations a number of requirements must hold simultaneously, while to call a situation bad even one failure suffices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=V.

'''Augustinian values''' refer to [[Value (ethics)|values]] which are [[Christian]] and which [[Augustine of Hippo]] has colored with his saintly life and deepened by his teaching. A "value" is a "good that contributes to the perfection of being (not having or doing)." "Christian values" are values based on the [[Gospel]] proclaimed by [[Christ]] and handed on to believers by the [[apostles]]. "Augustinian values" are "Christian values" which Augustine lived and taught in the conviction that such values contribute to the fulfillment of the Lord’s twofold commandment of love in the spirit of the [[Beatitudes]].{{cn|date=March 2017}}

{{Buddhism}}
In [[Buddhism]], '''Bodhisattva''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|oʊ|d|iː|ˈ|s|ʌ|t|v|ə}} {{respell|BOH|dee|SUT|və}})&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/bodhisattva "Bodhisattva"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Sanskrit]] term for anyone who has generated [[Bodhicitta]], a spontaneous wish and compassionate mind to attain [[Buddhahood]] for the benefit of all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Bodhisattva Vow'': A Practical Guide to Helping Others, page 1, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-50-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bodhisattvas are a popular subject in [[Buddhist art]].

==Origins and outlines==
In early Buddhism, the term ''bodhisattva'' was primarily used to refer specifically to [[Gautama Buddha]] (a contemporary of [[Mahavira]]) in his former life.&lt;ref name="AC75"&gt;{{cite book |last=Coomaraswamy|first=Ananda |authorlink=Ananda Coomaraswamy |title=Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism |year=1975 |publisher=University Books |location=Boston|page=225 |lccn=64056434 |quote="[T]he term Bodhisattva, or Wisdom-being, first used of [[Gautama Buddha|Gautama]] between the Going-forth and the attainment of [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nibbāna]], came to mean a Buddha-designate...."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70982/bodhisattva|title=bodhisattva - Buddhist ideal|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jataka tales]], which are the stories of the Buddha's past lives, depict the various attempts of the bodhisattva to embrace qualities like self-sacrifice and morality.&lt;ref name="Brit" /&gt; The bodhisattva is also called a pusa. This is one who had achieved Buddhahood but chooses to remain in merciful attachment to the world. In Sanskrit this is called a Avalokitesvara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feuchtwang |first1=Stephan |title=Religions in the Modern World |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |pages=154 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Jataka tales]], the term "bodhisattva" originally referred to the pre-enlightened practitioner of austerities that surpassed [[Śrāvakayāna]] and [[Pratyekabuddhayāna]] by far and completed the "Bodhisattvayāna" ([[Mahayana|Mahayāna Buddhism]]). [[Mount Potalaka]], for example, is one of Bodhisattvayana. The term for practitioners who have not yet reached Bodhisattvayāna was not fixed, but the terms ''Śrāvaka-Bodhisattva'' (聲聞菩薩) and ''Pratyekabuddha-Bodhisattva'' (縁覚菩薩) had already appeared in the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgama]]s of early Indian Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://21dzk.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/SAT/ddb-sat2.php?key=%E5%A3%B0%E8%81%9E%E8%8F%A9%E8%96%A9&amp;mode=search&amp;uarsers%5B0%5D=%E9%98%BF%E5%90%AB%E9%83%A8 聲聞菩薩 (Śrāvaka-Bodhisattva)]. 阿含部 (Āgama); Text Database of [[Taishō Tripiṭaka]]. (accessed: January 15, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://21dzk.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/SAT/ddb-sat2.php?key=%E7%B8%81%E8%A6%9A%E8%8F%A9%E8%96%A9&amp;mode=search&amp;uarsers%5B0%5D=%E9%98%BF%E5%90%AB%E9%83%A8 縁覚菩薩 (Pratyekabuddha-Bodhisattva)]. 阿含部 (Āgama); Text Database of Taishō Tripiṭaka. (accessed: January 15, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahayana Buddhism did not place much emphasis in honoring the Śrāvakayāna or Pratyekabuddhayāna since they were classified as part of the "[[Hinayana]]", but praise of the general Bodhisattvayāna was commonplace. Because Hinayana was disliked and the terms Śrāvaka-Bodhisattva or Pratyekabuddha-Bodhisattva were not widely used, while usage of the general term "bodhisattva" had grown in popularity. Nevertheless, "bodhisattva" retained an implied reference to someone on the path to become an [[arhat]] or [[pratyekabuddha]]. In contrast, the goal of the bodhisattva path is to achieve ''[[Enlightenment in Buddhism|samyaksambodhi]].'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gethin|first1=Rupert|title=The foundations of Buddhism|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [England]|isbn=0-19-289223-1|pages=224–234|edition=1. publ. paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and Theravāda Buddhism==

&lt;!-- "Merit § Merit and Nirvana" links here --&gt;
[[File:Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara-BMA.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze statue of [[Avalokiteśvara]]. [[Sri Lanka]], ca. 750 CE.]]

In [[early Buddhism]], the equivalent [[Pali]] term ''bodhisatta'' is used in the [[Pāli Canon]] to refer to Gautama Buddha in his previous lives&lt;ref&gt;Basham, A.L. (1981). The evolution of the concept of the bodhisattva. In: Leslie S Kawamura, The Bodhisattva doctrine in Buddhism, Published for the Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion by Wilfred Laurier University Press, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; and as a young man in his current life in the period during which he was working towards his own [[moksha|liberation]]. During his discourses, to recount his experiences as a young aspirant he regularly uses the phrase "When I was an unenlightened bodhisatta..." The term therefore connotes a being who is "bound for enlightenment", in other words, a person whose aim is to become fully enlightened. In the Pāli canon, the bodhisatta is also described as someone who is still subject to birth, illness, death, sorrow, defilement, and delusion. Some of the previous lives of the Buddha as a bodhisattva are featured in the Jataka tales.

According to the Theravāda monk [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the bodhisattva path is not taught in the earliest strata of Buddhist texts such as the Pali [[Nikayas]] (and their counterparts such as the Chinese [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]]) which instead focus on the ideal of the [[Arahant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/arahantsbodhisattvas.html|title=Arahants, Bodhisattvas and Buddhas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later [[Theravada#Scriptures|Theravada literature]], the term "bodhisatta" is used fairly frequently in the sense of someone on the path to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nt.med.ncku.edu.tw/biochem/lsn/newrain/books/sou/sou1.htm 南傳菩薩道（上）] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410162534/http://nt.med.ncku.edu.tw/biochem/lsn/newrain/books/sou/sou1.htm |date=April 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The later tradition of commentary also recognizes two additional types of bodhisattas: the ''paccekabodhisatta'', who will attain [[Pratyekabuddha|Paccekabuddhahood]], and the ''savakabodhisatta'', who will attain enlightenment as a disciple of a Buddha. In the 1st-2nd century BCE Sri Lankan work, the [[Buddhavamsa]], the idea of the person who makes a Bodhisatta vow to become a fully enlightened Buddha out of compassion for all sentient  beings is presented. Another related concept outlined in the Buddhavamsa and in another text called the [[Cariyapitaka]] is the need to cultivate certain Bodhisatta perfections or [[paramitas]]

[[Image:DevoteeDetail.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Probable early image of a Bodhisattva ([[Bimaran casket]], 50 CE).&lt;ref name="Crossroads"&gt;"The crossroads of Asia", edited by Ellizabeth Errington and [[Joe Cribb]], The ancient India and Iran Trust, 1992, {{ISBN|0951839918}}, p.189-190&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Kings of [[Sri Lanka]] were often described as bodhisattvas, starting at least as early as Sirisanghabodhi (r. 247-249), who was renowned for his compassion, took vows for the welfare of the citizens, and was regarded as a [[Mahāsattva|mahāsatta]] (Sanskrit ''mahāsattva''), an epithet used almost exclusively in Mahayana Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, John. ''Buddha in the Crown : Avalokitesvara in the Buddhist Traditions of Sri Lanka.'' 1991. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Many other Sri Lankan kings from the 3rd until the 15th century were also described as bodhisattvas and their royal duties were sometimes clearly associated with the practice of the Ten Pāramitās.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, John. ''Buddha in the Crown : Avalokitesvara in the Buddhist Traditions of Sri Lanka.'' 1991. pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;

Theravadin [[bhikkhu]] and scholar [[Walpola Rahula]] stated that the bodhisattva ideal has traditionally been held to be higher than the state of a ''śrāvaka'' not only in Mahayana but also in Theravada Buddhism. He also quotes the 10th century king of Sri Lanka, [[List of Sri Lankan monarchs#House of Lambakanna II .28691.E2.80.931017.29|Mahinda IV]] (956-972 CE), who had the words inscribed "none but the bodhisattvas will become kings of a prosperous Lanka," among other examples.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, John. ''Buddha in the Crown : Avalokitesvara in the Buddhist Traditions of Sri Lanka.'' 1991. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|But the fact is that both the Theravada and the Mahayana unanimously accept the Bodhisattva ideal as the highest...Although the Theravada holds that anybody can be a Bodhisattva, it does not stipulate or insist that all must be Bodhisattva which is considered not practical.|Walpola Rahula, ''Bodhisattva Ideal in Buddhism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha126.htm|title=Bodhisattva Ideal in Buddhism (from ''Gems of Buddhist Wisdom'')|author=Rahula, Walpola|publisher=Buddhist Missionary Society, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Paul Williams writes that some modern Theravada meditation masters in [[Thailand]] are popularly regarded as bodhisattvas.
{{quote|Cholvijarn observes that prominent figures associated with the [[Dhammakaya Movement|Self perspective]] in Thailand have often been famous outside scholarly circles as well, among the wider populace, as Buddhist meditation masters and sources of miracles and sacred [[amulet]]s. Like perhaps some of the early Mahāyāna forest hermit monks, or the later Buddhist Tantrics, they have become people of power through their meditative achievements. They are widely revered, worshipped, and held to be [[arhat]]s or (note!) bodhisattvas.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' Taylor &amp; Francis, 1989, page 328.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Jeffrey Samuels, it "may more accurately portray the differences that exist between the two yanas by referring  to Mahayana Buddhism as a vehicle in which the bodhisattva ideal is more universally applied, and  to Theravada Buddhism as a vehicle in which the bodhisattva ideal is reserved for and appropriated by certain exceptional people."&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, J. THE BODHISATTVA IDEAL IN THERAVAADA, BUDDHIST THEORY AND PRACTICE: A REEVALUATION OF THE BODHISATTVA-`SRAAVAKA OPPOSITION; Philosophy East and West Volume 47, Number 3 July 1997 P.399-415 (C) by University of Hawai'i Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Mahāyāna Buddhism==

===Bodhisattva ideal===
[[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism is based principally upon the path of a bodhisattva.
According to Jan Nattier, the term ''Mahāyāna'' ("Great Vehicle") was originally even an honorary synonym for ''Bodhisattvayāna'', or the "Bodhisattva Vehicle."&lt;ref name="Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 174"&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; The ''{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}'' contains a simple and brief definition for the term ''bodhisattva'', which is also the earliest known Mahāyāna definition.&lt;ref&gt;Mall, Linnart. ''Studies in the Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita and Other Essays.'' Motilal Banarsidass. 2005. pp. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira. ''A history of Indian Buddhism: from Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna.'' Motilal Banarsidass. 2007. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is given as the following.&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward. ''The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines and its Verse Summary.'' Grey Fox Press. 2001. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Because he has enlightenment as his aim, a bodhisattva-[[mahāsattva]] is so called.}}

The earliest depiction of the Bodhisattva path in texts such as the [[Ugraparipṛcchā Sūtra]] describe it as an arduous, difficult monastic path suited only for the few which is nevertheless the most glorious path one can take. Three kinds of Bodhisattvas are mentioned in the early Mahayana texts: the forest, city, and monastery Bodhisattvas - with forest dwelling being promoted a superior, even necessary path in sutras such as the Ugraparipṛcchā and the [[Samadhiraja Sutra|Samadhiraja]] sutras.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The early Rastrapalapariprccha sutra also promotes a solitary life of meditation in the forests, far away from the distractions of the householder life. The Rastrapala is also highly critical of monks living in monasteries and in cities who are seen as not practicing meditation and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, page 265.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ratnagunasamcayagatha also says the Bodhisattva should undertake ascetic practices ([[dhutanga]]), "wander freely without a home", practice the [[paramitas]] and train under a guru in order to perfect his meditation practice and realization of [[prajnaparamita]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald. Buddhist saints in India, page 255.&lt;/ref&gt; These texts seem to indicate the initial Bodhisattva ideal was associated with a strict forest [[asceticism]].

Mahāyāna Buddhism encourages everyone to become bodhisattvas and to take the [[bodhisattva vows]]. With these vows, one makes the promise to work for the complete enlightenment of all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] by practicing the six perfections.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others'', pages 4-12, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-50-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indelibly entwined with the bodhisattva vow is [[parinamana|merit transference]] (''pariṇāmanā'').

In the ''[[Lotus Sūtra]]'', life in this world is compared to people living in a house that is on fire. People take this world as reality pursuing worldly projects and pleasures without realizing that the house is ablaze and will soon burn down (due to the inevitability of suffering). A bodhisattva is one who has a determination to free sentient beings from [[samsara]] and its cycle of death, rebirth and suffering. This type of mind is known as the [[bodhicitta|mind of awakening]] (''bodhicitta'').

A commonly repeated misconception in Western literature is that bodhisattvas delay their own liberation. This confusion is based on a misreading of several different scriptural concepts and narratives. One of these is the Tibetan teaching on three types of motivation for generating bodhicitta. According to [[Patrul Rinpoche]]'s 19th century ''Words of My Perfect Teacher'' (''Kun bzang bla ma'i gzhal lung''), a bodhisattva might be motivated in one of three ways. They are:
# King-like bodhicitta - To aspire to become a Buddha first in order to then help sentient beings.
# Boatman-like bodhicitta - To aspire to become a Buddha at the same time as other sentient beings.
# Shepherd-like bodhicitta - To aspire to become a Buddha only after all other sentient beings have done so.

These three are not types of people, but rather types of motivation. According to Patrul Rinpoche, the third quality of intention is most noble though the mode by which buddhahood actually occurs is the first; that is, it is only possible to teach others the path to enlightenment once one has attained enlightenment oneself.&lt;ref&gt; ''Words of My Perfect Teacher: A Complete Translation of A Classic Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism.'' Translated by The Padmakara Translation Group. (Walnut Creek: Altamira, 1994), 218. &lt;/ref&gt; The ritualized formulation of the bodhisattva vow also reflects this order (becoming a buddha so that one can then teach others to do the same). A bodhisattva vow ritual text attributed to [[Nāgārjuna]], of the second-third century CE, states the vow as follows: "Just as the past tathāgata arhat samyaksambuddhas, when engaging in the behavior of a bodhisattva, generated the aspiration to unsurpassed complete enlightenment so that all beings be liberated, all beings be freed, all beings be relieved, all beings attain complete nirvana, all beings be placed in omniscient wisdom, in the same way, I whose name is so-and-so, from this time forward, generate the aspiration to unsurpassed complete enlightenment so that all beings be liberated, all beings be freed, all beings be relieved, all beings attain complete nirvana, all beings be placed in omniscient wisdom." &lt;ref&gt; Nagārjuna. ''Byang chub mchog tu sems bskyed pa'i cho ga (Bodhicittotpadaviddhi, Ritual for Generating the Intention for Supreme Buddhahood).'' Toh. 3966 Tengyur, mdo, ''gi''. (sems can thams cad bsgral ba dang/ sems can thams cad dgrol ba dang/ sems can thams cad dbugs dbyung ba dang/ sems can thams cad yongs su mya ngan las 'da' ba dang/ sems can thams cad thams cad mkhyen pa'i ye shes la dgod pa'i slad du ci ltar bla na med pa yang dag par rdzogs pa'i byang chub tu thugs bskyed pa de bzhin du bdag ming 'di zhes bgyi ba yang dus 'di nas bzung)  &lt;/ref&gt; 

Another reason for the misconception that a bodhisattva "delays" liberation is that a bodhisattva rejects the liberation of the śravaka and pratyekabuddha, described in Mahāyāna literature as either inferior (as in [[Asaṅga]]'s fourth century ''[[Yogācārabhūmi]]'') or nonexistent (as in the ''Lotus Sūtra'').&lt;ref&gt; "bodhisattva" In ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013), 135. &lt;/ref&gt; That a bodhisattva has the option to pursue such a lesser path, but instead chooses the long path towards buddhahood is one of the five criteria for one to be considered a bodhisattva. The other four are: being human, being a man, making a vow to become a buddha in the presence of a previous buddha, and receiving a prophecy from that buddha. 

The six perfections that constitute bodhisattva practice should not be confused with the actual acts of benefiting beings that the bodhisattva vows to accomplish once he or she is a buddha. The six perfections are a mental transformation and need not actually benefit anyone. This is seen in the story of [[Vessantara]], an incarnation of Śākyamuni Buddha while he was still a bodhisattva, who commits the ultimate act of generosity by giving away his children to an evil man who mistreats them. Vessantara's actual acts do not benefit beings; in fact, he causes direct harm. However, the merit from his perfection of generosity fructifies in his lifetime as Śākyamuni Buddha when he attains complete enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt; "Vessantara" In ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013), 965. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Ten grounds===

According to many traditions within Mahāyāna Buddhism, on the way to becoming a Buddha, a bodhisattva proceeds through ten, or sometimes fourteen, grounds or ''[[Bhumi (Buddhism)|bhūmis]].'' Below is the list of the ten ''bhūmis'' and their descriptions according to the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'' and ''The Jewel Ornament of Liberation,'' a treatise by [[Gampopa]], an influential teacher of the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] [[Kagyu]] school. (Other schools give slightly variant descriptions.)

Before a bodhisattva arrives at the first ground, he or she first must travel the first two of five paths:
#the path of accumulation
#the path of preparation

The ten grounds of the bodhisattva then can be grouped into the next three paths
#''bhūmi'' 1 the path of insight
#''bhūmis'' 2-7 the path of meditation
#''bhūmis'' 8-10 the path of no more learning

The chapter of ten grounds in the ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra'' refers to 52 stages. The 10 grounds are:

#'''Great Joy:''' It is said that being close to enlightenment and seeing the benefit for all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]], one achieves great joy, hence the name. In this ''bhūmi'' the bodhisattvas practice all [[paramita|perfections]] (''pāramitās''), but especially emphasizing [[dana (Buddhism)|generosity]] (''dāna'').
#'''Stainless:''' In accomplishing the second ''bhūmi'', the bodhisattva is free from the stains of immorality, therefore, this ''bhūmi'' is named "stainless". The emphasized perfection is [[śila|moral discipline]] (''śīla'').
#'''Luminous:''' The light of Dharma is said to radiate for others from the bodhisattva who accomplishes the third ''bhūmi''. The emphasized perfection is [[kṣanti|patience]] (''{{IAST|kṣānti}}'').
#'''Radiant:''' This ''bhūmi'' it is said to be like a radiating light that fully burns that which opposes enlightenment. The emphasized perfection is [[vīrya|vigor]] (''vīrya'').
#'''Very difficult to train:''' Bodhisattvas who attain this ground strive to help sentient beings attain maturity, and do not become emotionally involved when such beings respond negatively, both of which are difficult to do. The emphasized perfection is [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|meditative concentration]] (''dhyāna'').
#'''Obviously Transcendent:''' By depending on the perfection of wisdom, [the bodhisattva] does not abide in either ''[[saṃsāra|{{IAST|saṃsāra}}]]'' or ''[[nirvāṇa|{{IAST|nirvāṇa}}]]'', so this state is "obviously transcendent".  The emphasized perfection is [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] (''prajñā'').
#'''Gone afar:''' Particular emphasis is on the perfection of [[upaya|skillful means]] (''upāya''), to help others.
#'''Immovable:''' The emphasized virtue is aspiration. This "immovable" ''bhūmi'' is where one becomes able to choose his place of rebirth.
#'''Good Discriminating Wisdom:''' The emphasized virtue is power.
#'''Cloud of Dharma:''' The emphasized virtue is the practice of primordial wisdom.

After the ten ''bhūmis'', according to Mahāyāna Buddhism, one attains complete enlightenment and becomes a Buddha.

With the 52 stages, the ''[[Shurangama Sutra|Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'' recognizes 57 stages. With the 10 grounds, various [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] schools recognize 3–10 additional grounds, mostly 6 more grounds with variant descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://read.goodweb.cn/news/news_more.asp?lm2=603|title=ԲϢ - Ŀ ļ|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908080747/http://read.goodweb.cn/news/news_more.asp?lm2=603|archive-date=8 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akanistha.blogspot.com/2009/08/blog-post_4818.html|title=吉祥鄔金密嚴寺|author=鄔金旺度|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bodhisattva above the 7th ground is called a ''[[mahāsattva]]''. Some bodhisattvas such as [[Samantabhadra]] are also said to have already attained buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111105090211/http://wisdom.buddhistdoor.com/alankwan/2009/09/13/459-%E5%9B%A0%E5%9C%B0%E8%8F%A9%E8%96%A9%E5%92%8C%E6%9E%9C%E5%9C%B0%E8%8F%A9%E8%96%A9/ 459 因地菩薩和果地菩薩]&lt;/ref&gt;

===School doctrines===

Some sutras said a beginner would take 3–22 countless eons (''[[asaṃkhyeya|mahāsaṃkhyeya]] [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]'') to become a buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinawts.com/list/budedu1/082718255.htm 三大阿僧祇劫] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121061430/http://www.chinawts.com/list/budedu1/082718255.htm |date=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aaa.org.tw/Chen_voice/a_2008_11_25.pdf 成佛的目的是到每一個世界去度眾生.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411014117/http://aaa.org.tw/Chen_voice/a_2008_11_25.pdf |date=April 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hwayue.org.tw/lama/question4_08.htm 即身成就與三大阿僧祇劫之修行] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526210637/http://www.hwayue.org.tw/lama/question4_08.htm |date=May 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pure Land Buddhism]] suggests buddhists go to the [[pure land]]s to practice as bodhisattvas. [[Tiantai]], [[Huayan school|Huayan]], [[Zen]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] schools say they teach ways to attain buddhahood within one karmic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bukon.idv.tw/mantra/b11.htm|title=顯教與密教|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yinshun.org/Enlightenment/1997/1997oct/1999oct1.htm 「無諍之辯」導讀]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various traditions within Buddhism believe in specific bodhisattvas. Some bodhisattvas appear across traditions, but due to language barriers may be seen as separate entities. For example, [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] believe in various forms of [[Chenrezig]], who is [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokiteśvara]] in Sanskrit, [[Guanyin]] in China, Gwan-eum in Korea, Quan Am in Vietnam, and [[Kannon]] in Japan. Followers of Tibetan Buddhism consider the [[Dalai Lama]]s and the [[Karmapa]]s to be an emanation of Chenrezig, the Bodhisattva of Compassion.

[[Ksitigarbha|Kṣitigarbha]] is another popular bodhisattva in Japan and China. He is known for aiding those who are lost. His greatest compassionate vow is:

{{quote|If I do not go to the hell to help the suffering beings there, who else will go? ... if the hells are not empty I will not become a Buddha. Only when all living beings have been saved, will I attain [[Bodhi]].}}

The place of a bodhisattva's earthly deeds, such as the achievement of [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] or the acts of [[Dharma]], is known as a ''[[bodhimaṇḍa]]'', and may be a site of [[pilgrimage]]. Many temples and monasteries are famous as bodhimaṇḍas. Perhaps the most famous bodhimaṇḍa of all is the [[Bodhi Tree]] under which [[Shakyamuni|Śākyamuṇi]] achieved buddhahood. In the tradition of [[Chinese Buddhism]], there are four mountains that are regarded as bodhimaṇḍas for bodhisattvas, with each site having major monasteries and being popular for pilgrimages by both monastics and laypeople. These four bodhimandas are:

* [[Putuoshan|Mount Putuo]]: Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva
* [[Mount Emei]]: Samantabhadra Bodhisattva
* [[Mount Wutai]]: Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva
* [[Mount Jiuhua]]: Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva

'''Coercion''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|ˈ|ɜr|ʒ|ən|,_|-|ʃ|ən}}) is the practice of forcing another party to act in an involuntary manner by use of [[threat]]s or force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coercion|title=Definition of coercion|work=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves a set of various types of forceful actions that violate the [[free will]] of an individual to induce a desired response, for example: a bully demanding lunch money from a student or the student gets beaten. These actions may include [[extortion]], [[blackmail]], [[torture]], threats to induce favors, or even [[sexual assault]]. In law, coercion is codified as a [[duress]] crime. Such actions are used as leverage, to force the victim to act in a way contrary to their own interests. Coercion may involve the actual infliction of physical pain/injury or psychological harm in order to enhance the [[credibility]] of a threat. The threat of further harm may lead to the [[co-operation|cooperation]] or [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] of the person being coerced.

==Overview==
The purpose of coercion is to substitute one's aims to those of the victim. For this reason, many social philosophers have considered coercion as the polar opposite to [[Political freedom|freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wg1dvc2lfcEC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=%22The+purpose+of+coercion+is+to+substitute+one's+aims+to+those+of+the+victim.+For+this+reason,+many+social+philosophers+have+considered+coercion+as+the+polar+opposite+to+freedom%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20purpose%20of%20coercion%20is%20to%20substitute%20one's%20aims%20to%20those%20of%20the%20victim.%20For%20this%20reason,%20many%20social%20philosophers%20have%20considered%20coercion%20as%20the%20polar%20opposite%20to%20freedom%22&amp;f=false|title=Textbook on Legal Language and Legal Writing|last=Bhatia|first=Prof Dr K. L.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Universal Law Publishing|isbn=9788175348943|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of coercion are distinguished: first on the basis of the ''kind of injury'' threatened, second according to its ''aims'' and ''scope'', and finally according to its ''effects'', from which its legal, social, and ethical implications mostly depend.

===Physical===
Physical coercion is the most commonly considered form of coercion, where the content of the conditional threat is the [[use of force]] against a victim, their relatives or property. An often used example is "putting a gun to someone's head" (''at gunpoint'') or putting a "knife under the throat" (''at knifepoint'' or cut-throat) to compel action or the victim gets killed or injured. These are so common that they are also used as metaphors for other forms of coercion.

Armed forces in many countries use [[firing squad]]s to maintain [[discipline]] and intimidate the masses, or opposition, into submission or silent [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]]. However, there also are nonphysical forms of coercion, where the threatened injury does not immediately imply the use of force. Byman and Waxman (2000) define coercion as "the use of threatened force, including the limited use of actual force to back up the threat, to induce an adversary to behave differently than it otherwise would."&lt;ref&gt;Byman, Daniel L.; Waxman, Matthew C.: ''Kosovo and the Great Air Power Debate'', ''[[International Security]]'', Vol. 24, No. 4 (Spring, 2000), pp. 5–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Coercion does not in many cases amount to destruction of property or life since compliance is the goal.

===Psychological===
In [[psychological coercion]], the threatened injury regards the victim's relationships with other people. The most obvious example is ''[[blackmail]]'', where the threat consists of the dissemination of damaging information. However, many other types are possible e.g. "[[emotional blackmail]]", which typically involves threats of rejection from or disapproval by a peer-group, or creating feelings of guilt/obligation via a display of anger or hurt by someone whom the victim loves or respects. Another example is [[coercive persuasion]].

Psychological coercion – along with the other varieties – was extensively and systematically used by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] during the "Thought Reform" campaign of 1951–1952. The process – carried out partly at "revolutionary universities" and partly within prisons – was investigated and reported upon by [[Robert Jay Lifton]], then Research Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University: see Lifton (1961). The techniques used by the Chinese authorities included a technique derived from standard [[group psychotherapy]], which was aimed at forcing the victims (who were generally intellectuals) to produce detailed and sincere ideological "confessions". For instance, a professor of [[formal logic]] called Chin Yueh-lin – who was then regarded as China's leading authority on his subject – was induced to write: "The new philosophy [of [[Marxism-Leninism]]], being scientific, is the supreme truth" [Lifton (1961) p.&amp;nbsp;545].

The '''[[Denmark|Danish]] bicycle [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]]-system''' is a system introduced in 1942 by the Danish government, providing all [[bicycle]]s in Denmark with a unique code. The code is a combination of [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] and [[Numerical digit|digits]] embedded into the [[bicycle frame]] and consists of a manufacturer code, a serial number, and construction year code.

Since 1948, it has been illegal&lt;ref name='law135of1948'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=122988 | title = Lov nr. 135 af 23. marts 1948: Bekendtgørelse af lov om mærkning af cykelstel m.v. | accessdate = 2011-06-18 | date = 1948-03-23 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; to sell bicycle frames in Denmark without an embedded VIN. Because of this, insurance companies in Denmark will not pay [[Insurance claim|indemnities]] for stolen bicycles without a VIN.&lt;ref name='dr1'&gt;{{cite news | first = Preben | last = Lund | title = Demand for marking of stolen goods | date = 2011-06-12 | url = http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2011/06/12/010459.htm | work = DR Nyheder | accessdate = 2011-06-18 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location of the VIN ==
By default, the VIN is to be [[Engraving|engraved]] into the [[Bicycle frame#Seat_tube|seat tube]] or the [[Bicycle frame#Down_tube|down tube]], but if these are made of such a material that hinders this, it may alternately be put on the [[Bottom bracket|bottom bracket shell]]. In very special instances, and only with the approval of the [[Rigspolitiet#Leadership|Danish National Police Commissioner’s Office]], it may be applied by other means and on other locations.&lt;ref name="law135of1948"/&gt;

== Components of the VIN ==
The bicycle VIN is constructed of three elements: a letter-block, a digit-block and a letter-block:

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
!Block
|1
|2
|3
|-
!Description
|[[Danish bicycle VIN-system#Common_manufacturer_codes|Manufacturers code]]
|Frame serial number
|[[Danish bicycle VIN-system#Production_year_identification_codes|Production year]]

|-
!Example 1
|WDA
|1234

|-
!Example 2

|}

The manufacturers-code, is a 1, 2, 3 or 4-letter block. If the code starts with a W, it is an imported bicycle frame. The second block is the frame serial number from that manufacturer. This shall have at least one digit, but can otherwise have any number of digits. The third block is a single letter code that identifies the production year. Certain limits regarding letters are instated for the VIN:&lt;ref name='askalex'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ask-alex.dk/artikler/Haandbogen/Bil-&amp;-Cykel/Find-cyklens-alder/e_140_3644.page |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311211953/http://www.ask-alex.dk/artikler/Haandbogen/Bil-%26-Cykel/Find-cyklens-alder/e_140_3644.page |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-11 |title=How to decode the bicycles age |accessdate=2011-07-07 |author=Dansk Cyklist Forbund |language=Danish |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* I is omitted as it can be confused with 1 (one)
* O is omitted as it can be confused with 0 (zero)
* Y is omitted as it can be confused with V

{{Solid principles}}
In [[object-oriented design]], the '''dependency inversion principle''' is a specific form of [[Coupling (computer programming)|decoupling]] software [[Modular programming|module]]s. When following this principle, the conventional [[dependency (computer science)|dependency]] relationships established from high-level, policy-setting modules to low-level, dependency modules are reversed, thus rendering high-level modules independent of the low-level module implementation details. The principle states:&lt;ref name="Martin2003"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea behind points A and B of this principle is that when designing the interaction between a high-level module and a low-level one, the interaction should be thought of as an abstract interaction between them. This not only has implications on the design of the high-level module, but also on the low-level one: the low-level one should be designed with the interaction in mind and it may be necessary to change its usage interface.

In many cases, thinking about the interaction in itself as an abstract concept allows the coupling of the components to be reduced without introducing additional coding patterns, allowing only a lighter and less implementation dependent interaction schema.

When the discovered abstract interaction schema(s) between two modules is/are generic and generalization makes sense, this design principle also leads to the following dependency inversion coding pattern.

==Traditional layers pattern==
In conventional application architecture, lower-level components (e.g. Utility Layer) are designed to be consumed by higher-level components (e.g. Policy Layer) which enable increasingly complex systems to be built. In this composition, higher-level components depend directly upon lower-level components to achieve some task. This dependency upon lower-level components limits the reuse opportunities of the higher-level components.&lt;ref name="Martin2003" /&gt;

[[File:Traditional Layers Pattern.png|center]]

The goal of the dependency inversion pattern is to avoid this highly coupled distribution with the mediation of an abstract layer, and to  increase the re-usability of higher/policy layers.

==Dependency inversion pattern==
With the addition of an abstract layer, both high- and lower-level layers reduce the traditional dependencies from top to bottom. Nevertheless, the "inversion" concept does not mean that lower-level layers depend on higher-level layers. Both layers should depend on abstractions that draw the behavior needed by higher-level layers.

[[File:DIPLayersPattern.png|center]]

In a direct application of dependency inversion, the abstracts are owned by the upper/policy layers. This architecture groups the higher/policy components and the abstractions that define lower services together in the same package. The lower-level layers are created by inheritance/implementation of these abstract classes or interfaces.&lt;ref name="Martin2003" /&gt;

The inversion of the dependencies and ownership encourages the re-usability of the higher/policy layers. Upper layers could use other implementations of the lower services. When the lower-level layer components are closed or when the application requires the reuse of existing services, it is common that an [[adapter pattern|Adapter]] mediates between the services and the abstractions.

== Dependency inversion pattern generalization ==
In many projects the dependency inversion principle and pattern are considered as a single concept that should be generalized. There are at least two reasons for that:
# It is simpler to see a good thinking principle as a coding pattern. Once an abstract class or an interface has been coded, the programmer may say: "I have done the job of abstraction". 
# Because many unit testing tools rely on inheritance to accomplish mocking, the usage of generic interfaces between classes (not only between modules when it makes sense to use generality) became the rule.
If the mocking tool used relies only on inheritance, generalizing the dependency inversion pattern may become a necessity. This has major drawbacks:
# Simply implementing an interface over a class isn't sufficient and generally does not reduce coupling, only thinking about the potential abstraction of interactions can lead to a less coupled design.
# Implementing generic interfaces everywhere in a project makes it by far harder to understand and maintain. At each step the reader will ask themself what are the other implementations of this interface and the response is generally: only mocks. 
# The interface generalization requires more plumbing code, in particular factories that generally rely on a dependency-injection framework.
# Interface generalization also restricts the usage of the programming language.

===Generalization restrictions===
The presence of interfaces to accomplish the Dependency Inversion Pattern (DIP) have other design implications in an [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented program]]:

* All member variables in a class must be interfaces or abstracts.
* All concrete class packages must connect only through interface or abstract class packages.
* No class should derive from a concrete class.
* No method should override an implemented method.&lt;ref name="Martin2003" /&gt;
* All variable instantiation requires the implementation of a [[creational pattern]] such as the [[Factory method pattern|factory method]] or the [[Factory (object-oriented programming)|factory]] pattern, or the use of a [[dependency injection|dependency-injection]] framework.

===Interface mocking restrictions===
Using inheritance-based mocking tools also introduce restrictions:
* Static externally visible members should systematically rely on dependency injection making them far harder to implement.
* All testable methods should become an interface implementation or an override of an abstract definition.

===Future directions===
Principles are ways of thinking, patterns are common ways to solve problems. Coding patterns may be seen as missing programming language features.
* Programming languages will continue to evolve to allow to enforce stronger and more precise usage contracts, in at least two directions: enforcing usage conditions (pre-, post- and invariant conditions), and state-based interfaces. This will probably encourage and potentially simplify a stronger application of the dependency inversion pattern in many situations.
* More and more mocking tools now use code injection to solve the problem of replacing static and non virtual members. Programming language will probably evolve to generate mocking-compatible bytecode. One direction will be to restrict the usage of non virtual members, the other one will be to generate, at least in test situations, a bytecode allowing non-inheritance based mocking.

==Implementations==
Two common implementations of DIP use similar logical architecture, with different implications.

A direct implementation packages the policy classes with service abstracts classes in one library. In this implementation high-level components and low-level components are distributed into separate packages/libraries, where the [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]] defining the behavior/services required by the high-level component are owned by, and exist within the high-level component's library. The implementation of the high-level component's interface by the low level component requires that the low-level component package depend upon the high-level component for compilation, thus inverting the conventional dependency relationship.

[[File:Dependency inversion.png|center]]

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate code with the same functionality, however in Figure 2, an interface has been used to invert the dependency. The direction of dependency can be chosen to maximize policy code reuse, and eliminate cyclic dependencies.

In this version of DIP, the lower layer component's dependency on the interfaces/abstracts in the higher-level layers makes re-utilization of the lower layer components difficult. This implementation instead ″inverts″ the traditional dependency from top-to-bottom to the opposite, from bottom-to-top.

A more flexible solution extracts the abstract components into an independent set of packages/libraries:

[[File:DIPLayersPattern v2.png|center]]

The separation of all layers into their own package encourages re-utilization of any layer, providing robustness and mobility.&lt;ref name="Martin2003" /&gt;

==Examples==

===Genealogical module===
A genealogical system may represent relationship between people as a graph of first level relationships between them (father/son, father/daughter, mother/son, mother/daughter, husband/wife, wife/husband...). This is very efficient (and extensible: ex-husband/ex-wife, legal guardian...)

But the high level modules may require a simpler way to browse the system: a person may have children, a father, a mother, brothers and sisters (including or not half brothers and sisters), grandfathers, grandmothers, uncles, aunts, cousins ...

Depending on the usage of the genealogical module, presenting common relationships as distinct direct properties (hiding the graph) will make the coupling between the high-level module and the genealogical module by far lighter and allow one to change the internal representation completely without any effect on the using modules. It also allows one to embed in the genealogical module the exact definition of brother and sisters (including or not half ones), uncles ... allowing one to enforce the [[single responsibility principle]].

Finally, if the first extensible generalized graph approach seems the most extensible, the usage of the genealogical module may show that a more specialized and simpler relationship implementation is sufficient for the application(s) and helps you to make a more efficient system.

In this example abstracting the interaction between the modules leads to a simplified interface of the low-level module and may lead to a simpler implementation of it.

===Remote file server client===
Imagine you have to implement a client to a remote file server (FTP, cloud storage ...). You may think of it as a set of abstract interfaces:
#Connection/Disconnection (a connection persistence layer may be needed)
#Folder/tags creation/rename/delete/list interface
#File creation/replacement/rename/delete/read interface
#File searching
#Concurrent replacement or delete resolution
#File history management ...

If both local files and remote files offers the same abstract interfaces, any high-level module using local files and fully implementing the dependency inversion pattern will be able to access local and remote files indiscriminately.

Local disk will generally use folder, remote storage may use folder and/or tags. You have to decide how to unify them if possible.

On remote file we may have to use only create or replace: remote files update do not necessarily make sense because random update is too slow comparing local file random update and may be very complicated to implement). On remote file we may need partial read and write (at least inside the remote file module to allow download or upload to resume after a communication interruption), but random read isn't adapted (except if a local cache is used).

File searching may be pluggable : file searching can rely on the OS or in particular for tag or full text search, be implemented with distinct systems (OS embedded, or available separately).

Concurrent replacement or delete resolution detection may impact the other abstract interfaces.

When designing the remote file server client for each conceptual interface you have to ask yourself the level of service your high level modules require (not necessary all of them) and not only how to implement the remote file server functionalities but maybe how to make the file services in your application compatible between already implemented file services (local files, existing cloud clients) and your new remote file server client.

Once you have designed the abstract interfaces required, your remote file server client should implement these interfaces. And because you probably restricted some local functionalities existing on local file (for example file update), you may have to write [[Adapter pattern|adapters]] for local or other existing used remote file access modules each offering the same abstract interfaces. You also have to write your own file access enumerator allowing to retrieve all file compatible systems available and configured on your computer.

Once you do that, your application will be able to save its documents locally or remotely transparently. Or simpler, the high level module using the new file access interfaces can be used indistinctly in local or remote file access scenarios making it reusable.

Remark : many OSes have started to implement these kind of functionalities and your work may be limited to adapt your new client to this already abstracted models.

In this example, thinking of the module as a set of abstract interfaces, and adapting other modules to this set of interfaces, allows you to provide a common interface for many file storage systems.

===Model View Controller===

[[File:DIP concrete example.png|center|Example of DIP]]

UI and ApplicationLayer packages contains mainly concrete classes. Controllers contains  abstracts/interface types. UI has an instance of ICustomerHandler. All packages are physically separated.  In the ApplicationLayer there is a concrete implementation that Page class will use. Instances of this interface are created dynamically by a Factory (possibly in the same Controllers package). The concrete types, Page and CustomerHandler, don't depend on each other; both depend on ICustomerHandler.

The direct effect is that the UI doesn't need to reference the ApplicationLayer or any concrete package that implements the ICustomerHandler. The concrete class will be loaded using reflection. At any moment the concrete implementation could be replaced by another concrete implementation without changing the UI class. Another interesting possibility is that the Page class implements an interface IPageViewer that could be passed as an argument to ICustomerHandler methods. Then the concrete implementation could communicate with UI without a concrete dependency. Again, both are linked by interfaces.

==Related patterns==
Applying the dependency inversion principle can also be seen as an example of the [[adapter pattern]], i.e. the high-level class defines its own adapter interface which is the abstraction that the other high-level classes depend on. The adaptee implementation also depends on the adapter interface abstraction (of course, since it implements its interface) while it can be implemented by using code from within its own low-level module. The high-level has no dependency on the low-level module since it only uses the low-level indirectly through the adapter interface by invoking polymorphic methods to the interface which are implemented by the adaptee and its low-level module.

Various patterns such as Plugin, [[Service locator pattern|Service Locator]], or [[Dependency Injection]] are employed to facilitate the run-time provisioning of the chosen low-level component implementation to the high-level component.

==History==
The dependency inversion principle was postulated by [[Robert C. Martin]] and described in several publications including the paper ''Object Oriented Design Quality Metrics: an analysis of dependencies'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://linux.ime.usp.br/~joaomm/mac499/arquivos/referencias/oodmetrics.pdf|title=Object Oriented Design Quality Metrics: An analysis of dependencies|last=Martin|first=Robert C.|date=|website=|publisher=|publication-date=October 1994|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; an article appearing in the C++ Report in May 1996 entitled ''The Dependency Inversion Principle'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf|title=The Dependency Inversion Principle|last=Martin|first=Robert C.|date=May 1996|website=|publisher=C++ Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714224327/http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-14|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the books ''Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices'',&lt;ref name="Martin2003" /&gt; and ''Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#''.

== History ==
The concept was first articulated in a 1972 article ''The dignity of risk and the mentally retarded'' by Robert Perske:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Overprotection may appear on the surface to be kind, but it can be really evil. An oversupply can smother people emotionally, squeeze the life out of their hopes and expectations, and strip them of their dignity. Overprotection can keep people from becoming all they could become. Many of our best achievements came the hard way: We took risks, fell flat, suffered, picked ourselves up, and tried again. Sometimes we made it and sometimes we did not. Even so, we were given the chance to try. Persons with special needs need these chances, too. Of course, we are talking about prudent risks. People should not be expected to blindly face challenges that, without a doubt, will explode in their faces. Knowing which chances are prudent and which are not – this is a new skill that needs to be acquired. On the other hand, a risk is really only when it is not known beforehand whether a person can succeed. The real world is not always safe, secure, and predictable, it does not always say “please,” “excuse me”, or “I’m sorry”. Every day we face the possibility of being thrown into situations where we will have to risk everything … In the past, we found clever ways to build avoidance of risk into the lives of persons living with disabilities. Now we must work equally hard to help find the proper amount of risk these people have the right to take. We have learned that there can be healthy development in risk taking and there can be crippling indignity in safety!&lt;ref name=Perske&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perske|first1=R|title=The dignity of risk and the mentally retarded.|journal=Mental retardation|date=February 1972|volume=10|issue=1|pages=24–7|pmid=5059995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conflict with duty of care==

{{English grammar}}
A '''double negative''' is a grammatical construction occurring when two forms of [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]] are used in the same sentence. '''Multiple negation''' is the more general term referring to the occurrence of more than one negative in a [[clause]]. In some languages, double negatives cancel one another and produce an affirmative; in other languages, doubled negatives intensify the negation. Languages where multiple negatives affirm each other are said to have '''negative concord''' or '''emphatic negation'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wouden|first1=Ton van der|title=Negative Contexts: Collocation, Polarity and Multiple Negation|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134773336|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d72GAgAAQBAJ&amp;&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and some  dialects of [[English language|English]], such as [[African-American Vernacular English]], are examples of negative-concord languages,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} while [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]] do not have negative concord. It is cross-linguistically observed that negative-concord languages are more common than those without.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Languages without negative concord typically have [[negative polarity]] items that are used in place of additional negatives when another negating word already occurs.  Examples are "ever", "anything" and "anyone" in the sentence "I haven't ever owed anything to anyone" (cf. "I have&lt;u&gt;''n't''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;''never''&lt;/u&gt; owed &lt;u&gt;''nothing''&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;''no one''&lt;/u&gt;" in negative-concord dialects of English, and "&lt;u&gt;''Nunca''&lt;/u&gt; devi &lt;u&gt;''nada''&lt;/u&gt; a &lt;u&gt;''ninguém''&lt;/u&gt;" in Portuguese, lit. "Never have I owed nothing to no one", or "&lt;u&gt;''Non''&lt;/u&gt; ho &lt;u&gt;''mai''&lt;/u&gt; dovuto &lt;u&gt;''nulla''&lt;/u&gt; a &lt;u&gt;''nessuno''&lt;/u&gt;" in Italian).  Note that negative polarity can be triggered not only by direct negatives such as "not" or "never", but also by words such as "doubt" or "hardly" ("I doubt he has ever owed anything to anyone" or "He has hardly ever owed anything to anyone").

Stylistically, in English, double negatives can sometimes be used for affirmation (e.g. "I'm not feeling not good"), an  [[understatement]] of the positive ("I'm feeling good").  The rhetorical term for this is [[litotes]].

==English==
===Two negatives resolving to a positive===
When two negatives are used in one independent clause, in standard English the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative:{{rp|see the Robert Lowth citation below}} this is known as [[litotes]]. However, depending on how such a sentence is constructed, in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence. For this reason, it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one's speech is lost. A double negative intensifier does not necessarily require the prescribed steps, and can easily be ascertained by the mood or intonation of the speaker.
* ''There isn't no other way.''

vs.
* ''There isn't no other way!''

These two sentences would be different in how they are communicated by speech. Any assumption would be correct, and the first sentence can be just as right or wrong in intensifying a negative as it is in cancelling it out; thereby rendering the sentence's meaning ambiguous. Since there is no adverb or verb to support the latter negative, the usage here is ambiguous and lies totally on the context behind the sentence. In light of punctuation, the second sentence can be viewed as the intensifier; and the former being a statement thus an admonishment.
&lt;!-- The following is a clever anecdote but not directly relevant --&gt;
&lt;!-- The context-dependent nature of this rhetorical device in English is illustrated in a well-known linguistic anecdote. Oxford philosopher of language [[J. L. Austin]] gave a lecture in which he noted that there are many languages wherein a double negative makes a positive, but none in which a double positive makes a negative.  From the audience, Columbia philosopher [[Sidney Morgenbesser]] replied, "Yeah, yeah."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001314.html|title=IF P, SO WHY NOT Q?|work=Language Log|author=[[Mark Liberman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

In [[standard written English|Standard English]], two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive. This rule was observed as early as 1762, when Bishop [[Robert Lowth]] wrote ''A Short Introduction to English Grammar with Critical Notes''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last = Fromkin|first = Victoria |author2=Rodman, Robert |author3=Hyams, Nina|title = An Introduction to Language, Seventh Edition|publisher = Heinle|year = 2002|page = 15|isbn = 0-15-508481-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, "I do not disagree" could mean "I certainly agree",  "I agree", "I sort of agree", "I don't understand your point of view", "I have no opinion", and so on; it is a form of "[[weasel word]]s". Further statements are necessary to resolve which particular meaning was intended.

This is opposed to the single negative "I do not agree", which typically means "I disagree". However,  the statement "I do not completely disagree" is a similar double negative to "I do not disagree" but needs little or no clarification.

With the meaning "I completely agree", Lowth would have been referring to [[litotes]] wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out. However, the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work, which could also imply he wanted either usage of double negatives abolished. Because of this ambiguity, double negatives are frequently employed when making [[back-handed compliments]]. The phrase "Mr. Jones was not incompetent." will seldom mean "Mr. Jones was very competent" since the speaker would have found a more flattering way to say so. Instead, some kind of problem is implied, though Mr. Jones possesses basic competence at his tasks.

===Two or more negatives resolving to a negative===
[[File:friar-canterbury-tales.jpg|thumb|right|The Friar from the [[Ellesmere Chaucer|Ellesmere Manuscript]] of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]’s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'']]
Discussing English grammar, the term "double negative" is often&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition. Op. cit. [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/double+negative Merriam-Webster Online]. Accessed 29 Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; though not universally&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/double+negative The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language], 4th ed. Houghton Mifflin Co, 2009. Accessed 29 Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/double-negative |title=double negative |work=Memidex/WordNet Dictionary |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied to the [[Standard English|non-standard]] use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation.

Double negatives are usually associated with regional and ethnical dialects such as [[Southern American English]], [[African American Vernacular English]], and various British regional dialects. Indeed, they were used in [[Middle English]]. Historically, [[Chaucer]] made extensive use of double, triple, and even quadruple negatives in his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. About the Friar, he writes "Ther nas no man no wher so vertuous" ("There never was no man nowhere so virtuous"). About the Knight, "He nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde / In all his lyf unto no maner wight" ("He never yet no vileness didn't say / In all his life to no manner of man").

Following the [[battle of Marston Moor]], [[Oliver Cromwell]] quoted his nephew's dying words in a letter to the boy's father [[Valentine Walton]]: "A little after, he said one thing lay upon his spirit. I asked him what it was. He told me it was that God had not suffered him to be no more the executioner of His enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Cromwell Lord Protector'', at 129, Primus, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-917657-90-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=088_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=God+had+not+suffered+him&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IL07T6XbOqG90AG75pmqCw&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=God%20had%20not%20suffered%20him&amp;f=false John Forster], ''Statesmen of the Commonwealth of England with a Treatise on the Popular Progress in English History'', pp. 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this particular letter has often been reprinted, it is frequently changed to read "not ... to be any more" instead.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Whereas some double negatives may resolve to a positive, in some dialects others resolve to intensify the negative clause within a sentence. For example:
* ''I didn't go nowhere today.
* ''I'm not hungry no more.
* ''You don't know nothing.
* ''There was never no more laziness at work than before.

In contrast, some double negatives become positives:
* ''I didn't '''not''' go to the park today.
* ''We can't '''not''' go to sleep!

The key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives. If a verb is present between the two, the latter negative becomes an intensifier which does not negate the former.  In the first example, the verb ''to go'' separates the two negatives; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb.  Indeed, the word 'nowhere' is thus being used as an [[adverb]] and does not negate the argument of the sentence. One interesting thing to note is that double negatives such as ''I don't want to know no more'' contrasts with Romance languages such as French in ''Je ne veux pas savoir.'' &lt;ref&gt;See the article regarding Romance languages explaining this form of double negation.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception is when the second negative is stressed, as in ''I'm not doing {{em|nothing}}; I'm thinking.''  A sentence can otherwise usually only become positive through consecutive uses of negatives, such as those prescribed in the later examples, where a clause is void of a verb and lacks an adverb to intensify it.  Two of them also use emphasis to make the meaning clearer. The last example is a popular example of a double negative that resolves to a positive. This is because the verb 'to doubt' has no intensifier which effectively resolves a sentence to a positive. Had we added an adverb thus:
* ''I have no doubt never this sentence is false.''

Then what happens is that the verb ''to doubt'' becomes intensified, which indeed deduces that the sentence is indeed false since nothing was resolved to a positive. The same applies to the third example, where the adverb 'more' merges with the prefix ''no-'' to become a negative word, which when combined with the sentence's former negative only acts as an intensifier to the verb ''hungry''. Where people think that the sentence ''I'm not hungry no more'' resolves to a positive is where the latter negative ''no'' becomes an adjective which only describes its suffix counterpart ''more'' which effectively becomes a noun, instead of an adverb. This is a valid argument since adjectives do indeed describe the nature of a noun; yet some fail to take into account that the phrase ''no more'' is only an adverb and simply serves as an intensifier. Another argument used to support the position double negatives aren't acceptable is a mathematical analogy: negating a negative number results in a positive one; e.g., {{nowrap|1=− −2 = +2}}; therefore, it is argued, ''I did not go nowhere'' resolves to ''I went somewhere''.

Other forms of double negatives, which are popular to this day and do strictly enhance the negative rather than destroying it, are described thus:

:''I'm not entirely familiar with [[Nihilism]] nor [[Existentialism]].''

Philosophies aside, this form of double negative is still in use whereby the use of 'nor' enhances the negative clause by emphasizing what isn't to be. Opponents of double negatives would have preferred ''I'm not entirely familiar with [[Nihilism]] or [[Existentialism]]''; however this renders the sentence somewhat empty of the negative clause being advanced in the sentence. This form of double negative along with others described are standard ways of intensifying as well as enhancing a negative. The use of 'nor' to emphasise the negative clause is still popular today, and has been popular in the past through works of Shakespeare and Milton:

:''Nor did they not perceive the evil plight''
:''In which they were'' ~ [[John Milton]] - [[Paradise Lost]]

:''I never was, nor never will be'' ~ [[William Shakespeare]] - [[Richard III]]

To the common reader the negatives herein do not cancel each other out but simply emphasizes the negative clause.

Up to the 18th century, double negatives were used to emphasize negation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.american.edu/cas/tesol/resources/upload/Kirby_Philippa.pdf Philippa Kirby], ''Double and Multiple Negatives, p. 2''&lt;/ref&gt; "Prescriptive grammarians" recorded and codified a shift away from the double negative in the 1700s. Double negatives continue to be spoken by those of Vernacular English, such as those of Appalachian English and African American Vernacular English.&lt;ref&gt;''p. 4''&lt;/ref&gt; To such speakers, they view double negatives as emphasizing the negative rather than cancelling out the negatives. Researchers have studied African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and trace its origins back to colonial English.&lt;ref&gt;''p. 5''&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that double negatives were present in colonial English, and thus presumably English as a whole, and were acceptable at that time. English after the 18th century was changed to become more logical and double negatives became seen as canceling each other as in mathematics. The use of double negatives became associated with being uneducated and illogical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/02/grammar-myths-3/], ''Oxford Dictionaries Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Essay towards a practical English Grammar'' of 1711, [[James Greenwood (grammarian)|James Greenwood]] first recorded the rule: "Two Negatives, or two Adverbs of Denying do in English affirm".{{sfn|Kallel|2011|p=131}}  [[Robert Lowth]] stated in his grammar textbook ''A Short Introduction to English Grammar'' (1762) that "two negatives in English destroy one another, or are equivalent to an affirmative".{{sfn|Kallel|2011|p=131}}  Grammarians have assumed that Latin was the model for Lowth and other early grammarians in prescribing against negative concord, as Latin does not feature it.  Data indicates, however, that negative concord had already fallen into disuse in Standard English by the time of Lowth's grammar, and no evidence exists that the loss was driven by prescriptivism, which was well established by the time it appeared.{{sfn|Kallel|2011|pp=130–131}}

===In film and television===
[[file:I wont not use no double negatives.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Bart Simpson]] attempting his exercise of double negatives in the [[Simpsons]] episode [[Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder]]]]
Double negatives have been employed in various films and television shows. In the film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the [[chimney sweep]] Bert employs a double negative when he says, "If you don't want to go nowhere..." Another is used by the bandits in the "[[stinking badges|Stinking Badges]]" scene of [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'': "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges!".

More recently, the British television show ''[[EastEnders]]'' has received some publicity over the [[Estuary English|Estuary]] accent of character [[Dot Branning]], who speaks with double and triple negatives ("I ain't never heard of no licence.").{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. In the [[Harry Enfield]] sketch "Mr Cholmondley-Warner's Guide to the Working-Class", a stereotypical Cockney employs a septuple-negative: "Inside toilet? I ain't never not heard of one of them nor I ain't nor nothing."

In music, double negatives can be employed to similar effect (as in [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Another Brick in the Wall]]", in which schoolchildren chant "We don't need no education / We don't need no thought control") or used to establish a frank and informal tone (as in [[The Rolling Stones]]' "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]").

==Germanic languages==
Double negation is uncommon in other [[West Germanic languages]]. A notable exception is [[Afrikaans]], where it is mandatory (for example, "He cannot speak Afrikaans" becomes ''Hy kan nie Afrikaans praat nie'', "He cannot Afrikaans speak not"). Dialectal Dutch, French and [[Khoisan languages|San]] have been suggested as possible origins for this trait. Its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as in these examples provided by Bruce Donaldson:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&amp;q=double+negative#v=onepage&amp;q=Ek%20het%20nie%20geweet%20dat%20hy%20sou%20kom%20nie&amp;f=false |title=''A Grammar of Afrikaans'', Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, p. 404 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ek het '''nie''' geweet dat hy sou kom '''nie'''''. ("I did not know that he would be coming.")
* ''Ek het geweet dat hy '''nie''' sou kom '''nie'''''. ("I knew that he would not be coming.")
* ''Hy sal '''nie''' kom '''nie''', want hy is siek''. ("He will not be coming because he is sick.")
* ''Dit is '''nie''' so moeilik om Afrikaans te leer '''nie'''''. ("It is not so difficult to learn Afrikaans.")

Another point of view is that this construction is not really an example of a "double negative" but simply a grammatical template for negation.  The second ''nie'' cannot be understood as a noun or adverb (as can, e.g., ''pas'' in French), and cannot be substituted by any part of speech other than itself with the sentence remaining grammatical.  It is a grammatical particle with no independent meaning that happens to be spelled and pronounced the same as the embedded ''nie'', meaning "not", through historical accident.

The second ''nie'' is used if and only if the sentence or phrase doesn't already end with ''nie'' or another negating adverb.
* ''Ek sien jou '''nie'''''. ("I don't see you")
* ''Ek sien jou '''nooit'''''. ("I never see you")

Afrikaans shares with English the property that two negatives make a positive.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} For example,
* ''Ek stem '''nie''' met jou saam '''nie'''''. ("I don't agree with you." )
* ''Ek stem '''nie''' '''nié''' met jou saam '''nie'''''. ("I don't ''not'' agree with you," i.e., I agree with you.)

While double negation is still found in the [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian dialects]] of west [[Flanders]] (e.g., ''Ik ne willen da nie doen'', "I do not want to do that") and in some villages in the central Netherlands such as [[Garderen]], it takes a different form than that found in Afrikaans. In [[Belgian Dutch]] dialects, however, there are still some widely used expressions like ''nooit niet'' ("never not") for "never".

Similar to some dialectal English, [[Austro-Bavarian language|Bavarian]] employs both single and double negation, with the latter denoting special emphasis. For example, compare the Bavarian ''Des hob i no nia ned g'hört'' ("This have I yet never not heard") with the standard German "Das habe ich noch nie gehört". The German emphatic "niemals!" (roughly "never ever") corresponds to Bavarian "(går) nia ned" or even "nie nicht" in Standard German pronunciation.

Another exception is [[Yiddish]]. Due to [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] influence, the double (and sometimes even triple) negative is quite common.

A few examples would be:
* איך האב '''קיינמאל''' '''נישט''' געזאגט ("I '''never''' '''didn't''' say")
* איך האב נישט '''קיין''' מורא פאר '''קיינעם''' '''ניט''' "I have '''no''' fear of '''no one not'''")
* It is common to add נישט ("not") after the Yiddish word גארנישט ("nothing"), i.e. איך האב גארנישט נישט געזאגט ("I have said nothing")

==Latin and Romance languages==
While in Latin a second negative word appearing along with ''non'' turns the meaning into a positive one: ''ullus'' means "any", ''nullus'' means "no", ''non...nullus'' (''nonnullus'') means "some". In the same way, ''umquam'' means "ever", ''numquam'' means "never", ''non...numquam'' (''nonnumquam'') means "sometimes", in many Romance languages a second term indicated a negative is required.

[[French grammar#Negation|In French]], the usual way to express negation is to employ two negatives, e.g. ''ne [verb] pas'', ''ne [verb] plus'', or ''ne [verb] jamais'', as in the sentences "Je ne sais pas" ("I do not know"), "Il n'y a plus de baguettes" ("There aren't any more baguettes"), and "On ne sait jamais" ("one never knows"). The second term was originally an emphatic; ''pas'', for example, derives from the Latin ''passus'', meaning "step", so that French ''Je ne marche pas'' and Catalan ''No camino pas'' originally meant "I will not walk a single step." This initial usage spread so thoroughly that it became a necessary element of any negation in the modern French language&lt;ref&gt;There are literary cases in which "ne" can be used without "pas"; many of these are traditional phrases stemming from a time before the emphatic became an essential part of negation.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, in fact, in contemporary French, the original actual negative ''ne'' is mostly left away in favour of ''pas'', as in ''Je sais pas'' "I don't know". In [[Northern Catalan]], ''no'' may be omitted in colloquial language, and [[Occitan language|Occitan]], which uses ''non'' only as a short answer to questions. In [[Venetian language|Venetian]], the double negation ''no ... mìa'' can likewise lose the first particle and rely only on the second: ''magno mìa'' ("I eat not") and ''vegno mìa'' ("I come not"). These exemplify [[Jespersen's cycle]].

[[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] languages usually employ doubled negative [[correlative]]s. Portuguese ''Não vejo nada'', Romanian ''Nu văd nimic'' and Italian ''Non vedo niente''&lt;ref&gt;In Italian a simple–negative phrase, ''Non vedo alcunché'' ("I don't see anything"), is also possible.&lt;/ref&gt; ("I do not see nothing") are used to express "No, I do not see anything". In Italian, a second following negative particle ''non'' turns the phrase into a positive one, but with a slightly different meaning. For instance, while both ''Voglio mangiare'' ("I want to eat") and ''Non voglio non mangiare'' ("I don't want not to eat") mean "I want to eat", the latter phrase more precisely means "I'd prefer to eat".

Other Romance languages employ double negatives less regularly. In [[Asturian language|Asturian]], an extra negative particle is used with negative adverbs: ''Yo nunca nun lu viera'' ("I had not never seen him") means "I have never seen him" and ''A mi tampoco nun me presta'' ("I neither do not like it") means "I do not like it either". Standard Catalan and Galician also used to possess a tendency to double ''no'' with other negatives, so ''Jo tampoc no l'he vista'' or ''Eu tampouco non a vira'', respectively ("I neither have not seen her") meant "I have not seen her either". That practice is dying out.

In 1974, Italy held [[Italian_divorce_referendum,_1974#Confusion_about_voting_methods|a referendum]] on whether to repeal a recent law that allowed divorce.  Voters were said to have been confused in that in order to support divorce, they needed to vote 'no' on the referendum which was worded so that 'yes' would support repeal.  And to reframe the fundamental underlying issue as being support/non-support of the continuation of marriage, then the vote was structured as a triple negative (with divorce as the negation of the continuation of marriage being the first negative).  This referendum was defeated, and without this confusion, it was said that it would have been defeated more decisively.

==Welsh==
In spoken [[Welsh language|Welsh]], the word '''ddim''' (not) often occurs with a prefixed or [[Consonant mutation|mutated]] verb form that is negative in meaning: ''Dydy hi ddim yma'' (word-for-word, "Not-is she not here") expresses "She is not here" and ''Chaiff Aled ddim mynd'' (word-for-word, "Not-will-get Aled not go") expresses "Aled is not allowed to go".

Negative correlatives can also occur with already negative verb forms. In literary Welsh, the mutated verb form is caused by an initial negative particle, '''ni''' or '''nid'''.  The particle is usually omitted in speech but the mutation remains: ''[Ni] wyddai neb'' (word-for-word, "[Not] not-knew nobody") means "Nobody knew" and ''[Ni] chaiff Aled fawr o bres'' (word-for-word, "[Not] not-will-get Aled lots of money") means "Aled will not get much money". This is not usually regarded as three negative markers, however, because the negative mutation is really just an effect of the initial particle on the following word.&lt;ref&gt;

==Greek==
===Ancient Greek===
Doubled negatives are perfectly correct in [[Ancient Greek]].  With few exceptions, a simple negative (οὐ or μή) following another negative (for example, οὐδείς, ''no one'') results in an affirmation: οὐδείς οὐκ ἔπασχε τι ("No one was not suffering") means more simply "Everyone was suffering". Meanwhile, a compound negative following a negative strengthens the negation: μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς ("Do not permit no one to raise an uproar") means "Let not a single one among them raise an uproar".

Those constructions apply only when the negatives all refer to the same word or expression. Otherwise, the negatives simply work independently of one another: οὐ διὰ τὸ μὴ ἀκοντίζειν οὐκ ἔβαλον αὐτόν means "It was not on account of their not throwing that they did not hit him", and one should not blame them for not trying.

===Modern Greek===
In [[Modern Greek]], negative concord is standard and more commonly used. For example, the sentence 'You (pl.) will not find anything' can be said in two ways: 'Δε θα βρείτε τίποτα' ('Not will find nothing') is more common than 'Δε θα βρείτε κάτι' ('Not will find something'). It depends simply on the mood of the speaker, and the latter being is considered slightly more polite. An exception to that rule is the (archaic) pronoun ουδείς, also meaning "no one", which does not allow negation of the verb that it governs.

==Slavic languages==
In [[Slavic languages]] other than [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]], multiple negatives are grammatically correct ways to express negation, and a single negative is often incorrect. In complex sentences, every part that could be grammatically negated should be negative. For example, in the [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], ''Ni(t)ko nikad(a) nigd(j)e ništa nije uradio'' ("Nobody never did not do nothing nowhere") means "Nobody has ever done anything, anywhere", and ''Nikad nisam tamo išao/išla'' ("Never I did not go there") means "I have never been there". In Czech it is also common to use  three or more negations. For example, ''Nikdy jsem nikde nikoho neviděl'' ("I have not never seen no one nowhere"). In Russian, "I know nothing" is я ничего не знаю (''ya nichevo nye znayu''), lit. "I nothing don't know."

A single negation, while syntactically correct, may result in a very unusual meaning or make no sense at all. Saying "I saw nobody" in [[Polish language|Polish]] (''Widziałem nikogo'') instead of the more usual "I did not see nobody" (''Nikogo nie widziałem'') might mean "I saw an instance of nobody" or "I saw Mr. Nobody" but it would not have its plain English meaning. Likewise, in [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], saying "I do not know anyone" (''{{lang|sl|Ne poznam kogarkoli}}'') in place of "I do not know no one" (''{{lang|sl|Ne poznam nikogar}}'') has the connotation "I do not know just ''anyone''": I know someone important or special.

==Baltic languages==
As with most [[synthetic language|synthetic]] ''[[centum-satem isogloss|satem]]'' languages double negative is mandatory{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} in [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. Furthermore, all verbs and [[indefinite pronoun]]s in a given statement must be negated, so it could be said that multiple negative is mandatory in Latvian.

For instance, a statement "I have '''not''' &lt;u&gt;ever&lt;/u&gt; owed &lt;u&gt;anything&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;anyone&lt;/u&gt;" would be rendered as ''es '''ne'''kad '''ne'''vienam '''ne'''ko '''ne'''esmu bijis parādā''. The only alternative would be using a negating [[subordinate clause]] and [[subjunctive]] in the [[main clause]], which could be approximated in English as "there has '''not''' &lt;u&gt;ever&lt;/u&gt; been an instance that I would have owed &lt;u&gt;anything&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;anyone&lt;/u&gt;" ('''''nav''' bijis tā, ka es &lt;u&gt;kādreiz&lt;/u&gt; būtu &lt;u&gt;kādam&lt;/u&gt; bijis &lt;u&gt;kaut ko&lt;/u&gt; parādā''), where negative pronouns (''nekad, neviens, nekas'') are replaced by [[indefinite pronoun]]s (''kādreiz, kāds, kaut kas'') more in line with the English "ever, any" indefinite pronoun structures.

==Uralic languages==
Double or multiple negatives are grammatically required in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] with negative pronouns: ''Nincs semmim'' (word for word: "[doesn't-exists] [nothing-of-mine]", and translates literally as "I do not have nothing") means "I do not have anything". Negative pronouns are constructed by means of adding the prefixes ''se-,'' ''sem-,'' and ''sen-'' to interrogative pronouns.

Something superficially resembling double negation is required also in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which uses the [[auxiliary verb]] ''ei'' to express negation. Negative pronouns are constructed by adding one of the suffixes ''-an,'' ''-än,'' ''-kaan,'' or ''-kään'' to interrogative pronouns: ''Kukaan ei soittanut minulle'' means "No one called me". These suffices are, however, never used alone, but always in connection with ''ei''. This phenomenon is commonplace in Finnish, where many words have alternatives that are required in negative expressions, for example ''edes'' for ''jopa'' ("even"), as in ''jopa niin paljon'' meaning "even so much", and ''ei edes niin paljoa'' meaning "not even so much".

==Turkish==

Negative verb forms are grammatically required in [[Turkish grammar|Turkish]] phrases with negative pronouns or adverbs that impart a negative meaning on the whole phrase. For example, ''Hiçbir şeyim yok'' (literally, word for word, "Not-one thing-of-mine exists-not") means "I don't have anything". Likewise, ''Asla memnun değilim'' (literally, "Never satisfied not-I-am") means "I'm never satisfied".

==Japanese==
Japanese employs [[litotes]] to phrase ideas in a more indirect and polite manner. Thus, one can indicate necessity by emphasizing that not doing something would not be proper. For instance, しなければならない (''shinakereba naranai'', "must") literally means "not doing [it] would not be proper". しなければいけません (''shinakereba ikemasen'', also "must") similarly means "not doing [it] cannot go forward".

Of course, indirectness can also be employed to put an edge on one's rudeness as well. "He has studied Japanese, so he should be able to write kanji" can be phrased 彼は日本語を勉強したから漢字で書けないわけがありません (''kare wa nihongo o benkyō shita kara kanji de kakenai wake ga arimasen''), there is a rather harsher idea: "As he has studied Japanese, the reasoning that he cannot write Kanji does not exist".

==Chinese==
[[Mandarin Chinese]] also employs [[litotes]] in a like manner. One common construction is '''不'''得'''不''' ([[Hanyu Pinyin|Pinyin]]: ''[[wikt:bùdébù|bùdébù]]'', "cannot not"), which is used to express (or feign) a necessity more regretful and polite than that expressed by 必须 (''[[wikt:bìxū|bìxū]]'', "must"). Compared with "我必须走" (''Wǒ bìxū zǒu'', "I must go"), "我'''不'''得'''不'''走" (''Wǒ bùdébù zǒu'', "I cannot not go") tries to emphasize that the situation is out of the speaker's hands and that the speaker has no choice in the matter: "Unfortunately, I have got to go". Similarly, "'''没有'''人'''不'''知道" (''Méiyǒu rén bù zhīdào'', "There is '''not''' a person who does '''not''' know") is a more emphatic way to express "Everyone knows".

Double negatives nearly always resolve to a positive meaning even in colloquial speech, while triple negatives resolve to a negative meaning. For example, "我'''不'''相信'''没'''人'''不'''来" (''Wǒ bù xiāngxìn méi rén bù lái'', "I do '''not''' believe '''no''' one will '''not''' come") means "I do not think everyone will come". However, triple or multiple negatives are considered obscure and are typically avoided.

==History of languages==
[[File:Jespersen's cycle.svg|thumb|250px|An illustration of Jespersen's cycle in French]]
{{main|Jespersen's Cycle}}
Many languages, including all living Germanic languages, French, Welsh and some Berber and Arabic dialects, have gone through a process known as [[Jespersen's cycle]], where an original negative particle is replaced by another, passing through an intermediate stage employing two particles (e.g. [[Old French]] ''jeo ne dis'' → Modern Standard French ''je ne dis pas'' → Modern Colloquial French ''je dis pas'' "I don't say").

In many cases, the original sense of the new negative particle is not negative ''per se'' (thus in French ''pas'' "step", originally "not a step" = "not a bit"), but in Germanic languages, such as English and German the intermediate stage was a case of double negation, as the current negatives ''not'' and ''nicht'' in these languages originally meant "nothing": e.g. [[Old English]] ''ic ne seah'' "I didn't see" &gt;&gt; [[Middle English]] ''I ne saugh nawiht'', lit. "I didn't see nothing" &gt;&gt; [[Early Modern English]] ''I saw not''.&lt;ref&gt;Kastovsky, Dieter. 1991. Historical English syntax. p. 452&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelderen, Elly. 2006. ''A history of the English language''. p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar development to a [[circumfix]] from double negation can be seen in non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] languages, too: for example, in [[Maltese language|Maltese]], ''kiel'' "he ate" is negated as ''ma kielx'' "he did not eat", where the verb is preceded by a negative particle ''ma''- "not" and followed by the particle -''x'', which was originally a shortened form of ''xejn'' "nothing" - thus, "he didn't eat nothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/language/maltesegrammar.htm#ver |title=Grazio Falzon.

'''Earth orbit rendezvous''' ('''EOR''') is a potential methodology for conducting round trip human flights to the Moon, involving the use of [[space rendezvous]] to assemble, and possibly fuel, components of a translunar vehicle in [[low Earth orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;"LOW EARTH ORBIT RENDEZVOUS STRATEGY FOR LUNAR MISSIONS" http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc06papers/158.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It was considered and ultimately rejected in favor of [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] (LOR) for [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo Program]] of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;"Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and the Apollo Program" http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Rendezvous.html&lt;/ref&gt; Three decades later, it was planned to be used for [[Project Constellation]], until that program’s [[Barack Obama space policy speech at Kennedy Space Center|cancellation in October 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, John F. (October 2006). "Constellation Program Overview" http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/163092main_constellation_program_overview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gemini and Agena target vehicle==
The [[Agena target vehicle]] (ATV) was used for testing Earth orbit rendezvous in the NASA [[Gemini Program]]. [[Gemini 6]] and [[Gemini 7]] rendezvoused in orbit in 1965, but without Agena. Next, [[Gemini 8]] successfully docked  with the Agena on March 16, 1966. The Agena-Gemini rendezvous also achieved other objectives in later Gemini launches, including docked orbital maneuvering ([[Gemini 10]] and [[Gemini 11]]), inspection of the abandoned Gemini 8 ATV (Gemini 10) and space walks ([[Gemini 12]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/124970031|title=Spaceflight : the complete story from Sputnik to shuttle -- and beyond|last=Sparrow|first=Giles|date=2007|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Ltd|year=2007|isbn=9781405318181|location=London|pages=110|oclc=124970031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apollo==
[[File:Apollo Earth Orbit Rendezvous - 10 launches required.jpg|thumb|200px|1961 sketch showing 10 C-1 launches required to assemble in Earth orbit an Apollo lunar landing mission.]]
The EOR proposal for Apollo consisted of using a series of small [[rocket]]s half the size of a [[Saturn V]] to put different components of a [[spacecraft]] to go to the Moon in [[orbit]] around the [[Earth]], then assemble them in orbit.  Experiments of [[Project Gemini]] involving docking with the [[Agena target vehicle]] were designed partly to test the [[Logical possibility|feasibility]] of this program.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

In the end, NASA employed the [[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous]] for the [[Project Apollo|Apollo Program]]: a  Saturn V would simultaneously lift both the [[Apollo Command Module|Apollo Command]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Modules]] into low Earth orbit, and then the Saturn V third stage would fire again ([[Trans-lunar injection]]) to send both spacecraft to the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Constellation==
This mode had been revived for [[Project Constellation]] as the [[Earth Departure Stage]] (EDS) and [[Altair (spacecraft)|Altair]] (LSAM), which would be launched into low Earth orbit on the [[Ares V]] rocket.  The EDS and Altair would  be met by the separately launched [[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion]] (CEV). Once joined in low Earth orbit, the three would then travel out to the Moon and the Orion/Altair combination would fly a [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] flight pattern.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5531">'''Mental energy''' or '''psychic energy''' is a concept in some [[psychology|psychological]] theories or models of a postulated unconscious mental functioning on a level between biology and consciousness.

==Philosophical accounts==
The idea harks back to Aristotle's conception of ''[[actus et potentia]]''. "Energy" here used in the literal meaning of "activity" or "operation". [[Henry More]], in his 1642 ''Psychodia platonica; or a platonicall song of the soul'', defined an "energy of the soul" as including "every phantasm of the soul". [[Julian Sorell Huxley]] defines "mental energy" as "the driving forces of the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], [[emotion]]al as well as [[intellect]]ual" (''On living in a revolution'' xv.192, 1944).

==Psychoanalytic accounts==
In 1874, the concept of "[[psychodynamics]]" was proposed with the publication of ''Lectures on Physiology'' by German physiologist [[Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke]] who, in coordination with physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], one of the formulators of the [[first law of thermodynamics]] ([[conservation of energy]]), supposed that all living organisms are energy-systems also governed by this principle. During this year, at the [[University of Vienna]], Brücke served as supervisor for first-year medical student Sigmund Freud who adopted this new "dynamic" physiology. In his ''Lectures on Physiology'', Brücke set forth the then-radical view that the living organism is a [[dynamic system]] to which the laws of [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] apply.&lt;ref name = "Hall" &gt;{{cite book | last = Hall | first = Calvin, S.| title = A Primer in Freudian Psychology | publisher = Meridian Book | year = 1954 | isbn = 0-452-01183-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'', Freud argued that the [[Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Id|id]] was the source of the personality's desires, and therefore of the psychic energy that powered the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hall, Calvin S. |author2=Nordby, Vernon J. | title=A Primer of Jungian Psychology | location=New York | publisher=Meridian | year=1999 | isbn=0-452-01186-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud defined [[libido]] as the instinct energy or force. Freud later added the [[death drive]] (also contained in the id) as a second source of mental energy.  The origins of Freud's basic model, based on the fundamentals of chemistry and physics, according to [[John Bowlby]], stems from [[Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke|Brücke]], [[Meynert]], [[Josef Breuer|Breuer]], [[Helmholtz]], and [[Herbart]].&lt;ref name="Bowlby" &gt;{{cite book | last = Bowlby | first = John | title = Attachment and Loss: Vol I, 2nd Ed. | publisher = Basic Books | pages = 13–23| year = 1999 | isbn = 0-465-00543-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, [[Carl Jung]] published a seminal essay entitled "On Psychic Energy". Later, the theory of psychodynamics and the concept of "psychic energy" was developed further by those such as [[Alfred Adler]] and [[Melanie Klein]].

Just as physical energy acts upon physical objects, psychological energy would act upon psychological entities, i.e. thoughts. Psychological energy and force are the basis of an attempt to formulate a scientific theory according to which psychological phenomena would be subject to precise laws akin to how physical objects are subject to Newton's laws. This concept of psychological energy is completely separate and distinct from (or even opposed to) the mystical eastern concept of [[energy (spiritual)|spiritual energy]].

The [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator#Attitudes: extraversion/introversion|Myers–Briggs Type Indicator
]]  divides people into 16 categories based on whether certain activities leave them feeling energized or drained of energy.

==Neuroscientific accounts==
Mental energy has been repeatedly compared to or connected with the physical quantity [[energy]].

Studies of the 1990s to 2000s (and earlier) have found that mental effort can be measured in terms of increased metabolism in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, D., Parker, P. Y., &amp; Donohoe, R. T. (1996). The supply of glucose to the brain and cognitive functioning. Journal of Biosocial Science, 28, 463–479. Fairclough, S. H., &amp; Houston, K. (2004). A metabolic measure of mental effort. Biological Psychology, 66, 177-190.  Gailliot, M.T., Baumeister, R.F., et al. (in press). Self-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source: Willpower is more than a metaphor. ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern neuroscientific view is that [[brain metabolism]], measured by [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] or [[positron emission tomography]], is a physical [[correlate]] of mental activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6773">In [[mathematics]], an '''exponential field''' is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] that has an extra operation on its elements which extends the usual idea of [[exponentiation]].

==Definition==

A field is an algebraic structure composed of a set of elements, ''F'', two [[binary operation]]s, addition (+) such that ''F'' forms an [[abelian group]] with identity 0&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; and multiplication (·), such that ''F'' excluding 0&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; forms an abelian group under multiplication with identity 1&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;, and such that multiplication is distributive over addition, that is for any elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''F'', one has {{nowrap|1=''a'' · (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'')}}.  If there is also a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] ''E'' that maps ''F'' into ''F'', and such that for every ''a'' and ''b'' in ''F'' one has
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;E(a+b)=E(a)\cdot E(b),\\&amp;E(0_F)=1_F \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
then ''F'' is called an exponential field, and the function ''E'' is called an exponential function on ''F''.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Wolter, ''Some results about exponential fields (survey)'', Mémoires de la S.M.F. 2&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; série, '''16''', (1984), pp.85&amp;ndash;94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus an exponential function on a field is a [[homomorphism]] between the additive group of ''F'' and its multiplicative group.

== Trivial exponential function ==
There is a trivial exponential function on any field, namely the map that sends every element to the identity element of the field under multiplication.  Thus every field is trivially also an exponential field, so the cases of interest to mathematicians occur when the exponential function is non-trivial.

Exponential fields are sometimes required to have [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero as the only exponential function on a field with nonzero characteristic is the trivial one.&lt;ref name="Dries"&gt;Lou van den Dries, ''Exponential rings, exponential polynomials and exponential functions'', Pacific Journal of Mathematics, '''113''', no.1 (1984), pp.51&amp;ndash;66.&lt;/ref&gt;  To see this first note that for any element ''x'' in a field with characteristic ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0,
:&lt;math&gt;1=E(0)=E(\underbrace{x+x+\ldots+x}_{p\text{ of these}})=E(x)E(x)\cdots E(x)=E(x)^p.&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, taking into account the [[Frobenius endomorphism]],
:&lt;math&gt;(E(x)-1)^p=E(x)^p-1^p=E(x)^p-1=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
And so ''E''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for every ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bays, Jonathan Kirby, A.J. Wilkie, ''A Schanuel property for exponentially transcendental powers'', (2008), {{arxiv|0810.4457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* The field of real numbers '''R''', or {{nowrap|('''R''', +, ·, 0, 1)}} as it may be written to highlight that we are considering it purely as a field with addition, multiplication, and special constants zero and one, has infinitely many exponential functions.  One such function is the usual [[exponential function]], that is {{nowrap|1=''E''(''x'') = [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']]&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, since we have {{nowrap|1=''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''+''y''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=''e''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}, as required.  Considering the [[ordered field]] '''R''' equipped with this function gives the ordered real exponential field, denoted {{nowrap|1='''R'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; = ('''R''', +, ·, &lt;, 0, 1, exp)}}.
* Any real number {{nowrap|''a'' &gt; 0}} gives an exponential function on '''R''', where the map {{nowrap|1=''E''(''x'') = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} satisfies the required properties.
* Analogously to the real exponential field, there is the [[Complex number|complex]] exponential field, {{nowrap|1='''C'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; = ('''C''', +, ·, 0, 1, exp)}}.
* Boris Zilber constructed an exponential field ''K''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; that, crucially, satisfies the equivalent formulation of [[Schanuel's conjecture]] with the field's exponential function.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Zilber, ''Pseudo-exponentiation on algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero'', Ann. Pure Appl. Logic, '''132''', no.1 (2005), pp.67–95.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is conjectured that this exponential field is actually '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;, and a proof of this fact would thus prove Schanuel's conjecture.

==Exponential rings==
The underlying set ''F'' may not be required to be a field but instead allowed to simply be a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], ''R'', and concurrently the exponential function is relaxed to be a homomorphism from the additive group in ''R'' to the multiplicative group of [[Unit (ring theory)|units]] in ''R''.  The resulting object is called an '''exponential ring'''.&lt;ref name="Dries"/&gt;

An example of an exponential ring with a nontrivial exponential function is the ring of integers '''Z''' equipped with the function ''E'' which takes the value +1 at even integers and &amp;minus;1 at odd integers, i.e., the function &lt;math&gt;n \mapsto (-1)^n.&lt;/math&gt;  This exponential function, and the trivial one, are the only two functions on '''Z''' that satisfy the conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppina Terzo, ''Some Consequences of Schanuel's Conjecture in Exponential Rings'', Communications in Algebra, Volume 36, Issue 3 (2008), pp.1171&amp;ndash;1189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open problems==

Exponential fields are much-studied objects in [[model theory]], occasionally providing a link between it and [[number theory]] as in the case of [[Boris Zilber|Zilber]]'s work on [[Schanuel's conjecture]].  It was proved in the 1990s that '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Model complete theory|model complete]], a result known as [[Wilkie's theorem]].  This result, when combined with Khovanskiĭ's theorem on [[pfaffian function]]s, proves that '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; is also [[o-minimal]].&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Wilkie, ''Model completeness results for expansions of the ordered field of real numbers by restricted Pfaffian functions and the exponential function'', J. Amer. Math. Soc., '''9''' (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;1051–1094.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is known that '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; is not model complete.&lt;ref&gt;David Marker, ''A remark on Zilber's pseudoexponentiation'', The Journal of Symbolic Logic, '''71''', no.3 (2006), pp.&amp;nbsp;791–798.&lt;/ref&gt;  The question of [[Decidability (logic)|decidability]] is still unresolved.  [[Alfred Tarski]] posed the question of the decidability of '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; and hence it is now known as [[Tarski's exponential function problem]].  It is known that if the real version of Schanuel's conjecture is true then '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; is decidable.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Macintyre, A.J. Wilkie, ''On the decidability of the real exponential field'', Kreisel 70th Birthday Volume, (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Flavour quantum numbers}}

In [[particle physics]], '''flavour''' or '''flavor''' refers to the ''species'' of an [[elementary particle]]. The [[Standard Model]] counts six flavours of [[quark]]s and six flavours of [[lepton]]s. They are conventionally parameterized with ''flavour [[quantum number]]s'' that are assigned to all [[subatomic particle]]s. They can also be described by some of the [[family symmetries]] proposed for the quark-lepton generations.

==Quantum numbers==

In classical mechanics, a [[force]] acting on a [[point particle|point-like particle]] can only alter the [[particle]]'s dynamical state, i.e., its [[momentum]], angular momentum, etc.   [[Quantum field theory]], however, allows interactions that can alter other facets of a particle's nature described by non dynamical, discrete quantum numbers.  In particular, the action of the [[weak interaction|weak force]] is such that it allows the conversion of quantum numbers describing [[invariant mass| mass]] and [[electric charge]] of both quarks and leptons from one discrete type to another. This is known as a flavour change, or flavour transmutation. Due to their quantum description, flavour [[quantum state|states]] may also undergo [[quantum superposition]].

In [[atomic physics]] the principal quantum number of an [[electron]] specifies the [[electron shell]] in which it resides, which determines the [[energy level]] of the whole atom.  Analogously, the five flavour quantum numbers (isospin, strangeness, charm, bottomness or topness) can characterize the quantum state of quarks, by the degree to which it exhibits six distinct flavours (u, d, s, c, b, t).

Composite particles can be created from multiple quarks, forming [[hadron]]s, such as [[meson]]s and [[baryon]]s, each possessing unique aggregate characteristics, such as different masses, electric charges, and decay modes. A [[hadron]]'s overall flavour quantum numbers depend on the numbers of [[constituent quark]]s of each particular flavour.

===Conservation laws===
All of the various charges discussed above are conserved by the fact that the corresponding [[charge (physics)|charge operators]] can be understood as ''generators of symmetries'' that commute with the Hamiltonian. Thus, the eigenvalues of the various charge operators are conserved.

Absolutely conserved flavour quantum numbers are:
*[[electric charge]] ({{mvar|Q}})
*[[weak isospin]] ({{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}})
*[[baryon number]] ({{mvar|B}})&lt;!--including the baryon number for completeness--&gt;
*[[lepton number]] ({{mvar|L}})

In some theories, the individual baryon and lepton number conservation can be violated, if the difference between them ([[B − L|{{math|''B'' − ''L''}}]]) is conserved (see [[chiral anomaly]]). All other flavour quantum numbers are violated by the [[electroweak interaction]]s. [[Strong interaction]]s conserve all flavours.

==Flavour symmetry==&lt;!--'Flavour symmetry' redirects here--&gt;
If there are two or more particles which have identical interactions, then they may be interchanged without affecting the physics. Any (complex) linear combination of these two particles give the same physics, as long as the combinations are [[orthogonal]], or perpendicular, to each other.

In other words, the theory possesses symmetry transformations such as &lt;math&gt;M\left({u\atop d}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|d}} are the two fields (representing the various ''[[generation (particle physics)|generations]]'' of leptons and quarks, see below), and {{mvar|M}} is any {{gaps|2|×|2}} [[unitary matrix]] with a unit [[determinant]]. Such matrices form a [[Lie group]] called [[SU(2)]] (see [[special unitary group]]). This is an example of flavour symmetry.

In [[quantum chromodynamics]], flavour is a conserved [[global symmetry]]. In the [[electroweak theory]], on the other hand, this symmetry is broken, and flavour changing processes exist, such as [[quark|quark decay]] or [[neutrino oscillation]]s.

==Flavour quantum numbers==

===Leptons===
All [[lepton]]s carry a [[lepton number]] {{math|1=''L'' = 1}}. In addition, leptons carry [[weak isospin]], {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which is −{{sfrac|1|2}} for the three charged leptons (i.e. [[electron]], [[muon]] and [[tau (particle)|tau]]) and +{{sfrac|1|2}} for the three associated [[neutrino]]s. Each doublet of a charged lepton and a neutrino consisting of opposite {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} are said to constitute one [[generation (particle physics)|generation]] of leptons. In addition, one defines a quantum number called [[weak hypercharge]], {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which is −1 for all [[Chirality (physics)|left-handed]] leptons.&lt;ref&gt;See table in

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weak isospin and weak hypercharge are [[Gauge Theory|gauged]] in the [[Standard Model]].

Leptons may be assigned the six flavour quantum numbers: electron number, muon number, tau number, and corresponding numbers for the neutrinos. These are conserved in strong and electromagnetic interactions, but violated by weak interactions. Therefore, such flavour quantum numbers are not of great use. A separate quantum number for each [[generation (particle physics)|generation]] is more useful: electronic lepton number (+1 for electrons and electron neutrinos), muonic lepton number (+1 for muons and muon neutrinos), and tauonic lepton number (+1 for tau leptons and tau neutrinos). However, even these numbers are not absolutely conserved, as neutrinos of different generations can [[quantum superposition|mix]]; that is, a neutrino of one flavour can [[neutrino oscillation|transform into another flavour]]. The strength of such mixings is specified by a matrix called the [[Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix]] (PMNS matrix).

===Quarks===
All [[quark]]s carry a [[baryon number]] {{math|1=''B'' = {{sfrac|1|3}}}}. They also all carry [[weak isospin]], {{math|1=''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ±{{sfrac|1|2}}}}. The positive-{{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} quarks (up, charm, and top quarks) are called ''up-type quarks'' and negative-{{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} quarks (down, strange, and bottom quarks) are called ''down-type quarks''. Each doublet of up and down type quarks constitutes one [[generation (particle physics)|generation]] of quarks.

For all the quark flavour quantum numbers listed below, the convention is that the flavour charge and the electric charge of a quark have the same [[sign (mathematics)|sign]]. Thus any flavour carried by a charged [[meson]] has the same sign as its charge. Quarks have the following flavour quantum numbers:{{clarify|the list below would be much more readable in a table|date=March 2017}}
*The third component of [[isospin]] (sometimes simply ''isospin'') ({{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}), which has value {{math|1=''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|1|2}}}} for the up quark and {{math|1=''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = −{{sfrac|1|2}}}} for the down quark.
*[[Strangeness]] ({{mvar|S}}): Defined as {{math|1=''S'' = −(''n''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; − ''n''&lt;sub&gt;s&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;}}), where {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of [[strange quark]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Strange quark}}) and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;s&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of strange antiquarks ({{SubatomicParticle|Strange antiquark}}). This quantum number was introduced by [[Murray Gell-Mann]]. This definition gives the strange quark a strangeness of −1 for the above-mentioned reason.
*[[Charm (quantum number)|Charm]] ({{mvar|C}}): Defined as {{math|1=''C'' = (''n''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; − ''n''&lt;sub&gt;c&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of [[charm quark]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|charm quark}}) and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;c&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of charm antiquarks. The charm quark's value is +1.
*[[Bottomness]] (or ''beauty'') ({{mvar|B&amp;prime;}}): Defined as {{math|1=''B&amp;prime;'' = −(''n''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; − ''n''&lt;sub&gt;b&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of [[bottom quark]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|bottom quark}}) and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;b&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of bottom antiquarks.
*[[Topness]] (or ''truth'') ({{mvar|T}}): Defined as {{math|1=''T'' = (''n''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; − ''n''&lt;sub&gt;t&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of [[top quark]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|top quark}}) and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;t&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the number of top antiquarks. However, because of the extremely short half-life of the top quark (predicted lifetime of only {{val |5|e=-25|u=s}}), by the time it can interact strongly it has already decayed to another flavour of quark (usually to a [[bottom quark]]). For that reason the top quark doesn't [[hadronization|hadronize]], that is it never forms any [[meson]] or [[baryon]].

These five quantum numbers, together with baryon number (which is not a flavour quantum number), completely specify numbers of all 6 quark flavours separately (as {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; − ''n''&lt;sub&gt;q&amp;#773;&lt;/sub&gt;}}, i.e. an antiquark is counted with the minus sign). They are conserved by both the electromagnetic and strong interactions (but not the weak interaction). From them can be built the derived quantum numbers:
*[[Hypercharge]] ({{mvar|Y}}): {{math|1=''Y'' = ''B'' + ''S'' + ''C'' + ''B&amp;prime;'' + ''T''}}
*[[Electric charge]]: {{math|1=''Q'' = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|1|2}}''Y''}} (see [[Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula]])

The terms "strange" and "strangeness" predate the discovery of the quark, but continued to be used after its discovery for the sake of continuity (i.e. the strangeness of each type of hadron remained the same); strangeness of anti-particles being referred to as +1, and particles as −1 as per the original definition. Strangeness was introduced to explain the rate of decay of newly discovered particles, such as the kaon, and was used in the [[Eightfold Way (physics)|Eightfold Way]] classification of hadrons and in subsequent [[quark model]]s. These quantum numbers are preserved under [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[electromagnetic interaction]]s, but not under [[weak interaction]]s.

For first-order weak decays, that is processes involving only one quark decay, these quantum numbers (e.g. charm) can only vary by 1, that is, for a decay involving a charmed quark or antiquark either as the incident particle or as a decay byproduct, {{math|Δ''C'' {{=}} ±1}}; likewise, for a decay involving a bottom quark or antiquark {{math|Δ''B&amp;prime;'' {{=}} ±1}}. Since first-order processes are more common than second-order processes (involving two quark decays), this can be used as an approximate "[[selection rule]]" for weak decays.

A special mixture of quark flavours is an [[eigenstate]] of the [[weak interaction]] part of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]],  so will interact in a particularly simple way with the [[W  and Z bosons|W bosons]]. (Charged  weak interactions violate flavor). On the other hand, a [[fermion]] of a fixed mass (an eigenstate of the kinetic and strong interaction parts of the Hamiltonian) is  an eigenstate of  flavour.   The transformation from the former basis to the flavor-eigenstate/mass-eigenstate basis for quarks underlies the [[Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix]] (CKM matrix). This matrix is analogous to the PMNS matrix for neutrinos, and quantifies flavour changes under charged weak interactions of quarks.

The CKM matrix allows for [[CP violation]] if there are at least three generations.

===Antiparticles and hadrons===
Flavour quantum numbers are additive. Hence [[antiparticle]]s have flavour equal in magnitude to the particle but opposite in sign. [[Hadron]]s inherit their flavour quantum number from their [[valence quark]]s: this is the basis of the classification in the [[quark model]]. The relations between the hypercharge, electric charge and other flavour quantum numbers hold for hadrons as well as quarks.

==Quantum chromodynamics==
:''Flavour symmetry is closely related to [[chirality (physics)|chiral symmetry]]. This part of the article is best read along with the one on [[chirality (physics)|chirality]].''

[[Quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) contains six flavours of [[quark]]s. However, their masses differ and as a result they are not strictly interchangeable with each other. The up and down flavours are close to having equal masses, and the theory of these two quarks possesses an approximate SU(2) symmetry ([[isospin]] symmetry).

===Chiral symmetry description===

Under some circumstances{{clarify|which? would modeling a quark-gluon plasma be a good example?|date=March 2017}}, the masses of quarks do not meaningfully contribute to the system's behavior, and can be ignored. The simplified behavior of flavour transformations can then be successfully modeled as acting independently on the left- and right-handed parts of each quark field. This approximate description of the flavour symmetry is described by a chiral group {{math|SU&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;(''N''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) × SU&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;(''N''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

===Vector symmetry description===

If all quarks had non-zero but equal masses, then this chiral symmetry is broken to the ''vector symmetry'' of the "diagonal flavour group" {{math|SU(''N''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, which applies the same transformation to both [[helicity (particle physics)|helicities]] of the quarks. This reduction of symmetry is a form of ''[[explicit symmetry breaking]]''. The amount{{clarify|previous sentence gives no indication of how an amount comes into play|date=March 2017}} of explicit symmetry breaking is controlled by the [[current quark mass]]es in QCD.

Even if quarks are massless, chiral flavour symmetry can be [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] if the vacuum of the theory contains a [[chiral condensate]] (as it does in low-energy QCD). This gives rise to an effective mass for the quarks, often identified with the [[valence quark mass]] in QCD.

===Symmetries of QCD===
Analysis of experiments indicate that the current quark masses of the lighter flavours of quarks are much smaller than the [[QCD scale]], Λ&lt;sub&gt;QCD&lt;/sub&gt;, hence [[chiral flavour symmetry]] is a good approximation to [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] for the up, down and strange quarks. The success of [[chiral perturbation theory]] and the even more naive [[chiral model]]s spring from this fact. The valence quark masses extracted from the [[quark model]] are much larger than the current quark mass. This indicates that QCD has spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking with the formation of a [[chiral condensate]]. [[Quark matter|Other phases of QCD]] may break the chiral flavour symmetries in other ways.

==History==
Some of the historical events that led to the development of flavour symmetry are discussed in the article on [[isospin]].

In [[programming language theory]], '''flow-sensitive typing''' (or '''flow typing''') is a [[type system]] where the type of an [[Expression (computer science)|expression]] depends on its position in the [[control flow]].

In [[Static typing|statically typed languages]], a type of an expression is determined by the types of the sub-expressions that compose it. However, in flow-sensitive typing, an expression's type may be updated to a more specific type if it follows a statement that validates its type. The type is determined by using [[type inference]] and type information is carried using [[algebraic data type]]s.

== Example ==

=== Ceylon ===

See the following example in [[Ceylon (programming language)|Ceylon]] which illustrates the concept:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ceylon" line=1&gt;
// Object? means the variable "name" is of type Object or else null
void hello(Object? name) {
    if (is String name) {
        // "name" now has type String in this block
        print("Hello, ``name``!");
        // and it is possible to call String methods on the variable
        print(" String.size is ``name.size``");
    }
    else if (exists name) {
        // "name" now has type Object in this block
        print("Hello, object ``name``!");
    }
    else {
        print("Hello, world!");
    }
}

          
hello(null);
hello(1);
hello("John Doe");
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Which outputs:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;Hello, world!
Hello, object 1!
Hello, John Doe!
 String.size is 8&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=== Kotlin ===

[[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]] uses very flexible flow typing:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="kotlin" line=1&gt;
fun hello(obj: Any) {
    // A type cast fails if `obj` is not a String
    obj as String

    // Since the type cast did not fail, `obj` must be a String!
    val l = obj.length

    println("'$obj' is a string of length $l")
}

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Benefits ==

This technique coupled with type inference reduces the need for writing [[Type signature|type annotations]] for all variables or to do [[Type conversion|type casting]], like is seen with [[Dynamic typing|dynamic languages]] that use [[duck typing]]. It reduces [[verbosity]] and makes up for terser code, easier to read and modify.

It can also help language implementers to provide faster implementations for dynamic languages by statically predicting the type of objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.jooq.org/2014/12/11/the-inconvenient-truth-about-dynamic-vs-static-typing | title=The Inconvenient Truth About Dynamic vs. Static Typing | publisher=blog.jooq.org | date=11 December 2014 | accessdate=11 March 2016 | author=Lukas Eder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, it increases [[type safety]] and can prevent problems due to [[null pointer]]s, labeled by [[C.A.R. Hoare]]—the null reference inventor—as "the billion dollar mistake"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language ([[ALGOL W]]). My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn't resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fields of [[dynamical system]]s and [[control theory]], a '''fractional-order system''' is a dynamical system that can be modeled by a [[fractional differential equation]] containing [[fractional derivative|derivatives of non-integer order]].&lt;ref name=Monje2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Monje|first=Concepción A.|title=Fractional-Order Systems and Controls: Fundamentals and Applications|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781849963350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such systems are said to have ''fractional dynamics''. [[Differintegral|Derivatives and integrals of fractional orders]] are used to describe objects that can be characterized by [[Power law|power-law]] nonlocality&lt;ref name="Cattani2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cattani|first1=Carlo|last2=Srivastava|first2=Hari M.|last3=Yang|first3=Xiao-Jun|title=Fractional Dynamics|date=2015|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=9783110472097|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iNhaCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=power+law+nonlocality#v=onepage&amp;q=power%20law%20nonlocality&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Power law|power-law]] [[long-range dependence]] or [[fractal]] properties. Fractional-order systems are useful in studying the anomalous behavior of dynamical systems in physics, [[electrochemistry]], biology, [[viscoelasticity]] and [[chaotic system]]s.&lt;ref name=Monje2010 /&gt;

== Definition ==

A general dynamical system of fractional order can be written in the form&lt;ref name=Vinagre2002&gt;{{cite web|author1=Blas M. Vinagre |author2=C. A. Monje |author3=Antonio J. Calderon |title=Fractional Order Systems and Fractional Order Control Actions|url=http://mechatronics.ece.usu.edu/foc/cdc02tw/cdrom/Lectures/Lecture3/l3.pdf|publisher=41st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; H(D^{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_m})(y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_l) = G(D^{\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_n})(u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_k)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are functions of the [[fractional derivative]] operator &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of orders &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt; are functions of time. A common special case of this is the [[linear time-invariant]] (LTI) system in one variable:

: &lt;math&gt; \left(\sum_{k=0}^m a_k D^{\alpha_k}\right) y(t) = \left(\sum_{k=0}^n b_k D^{\beta_k}\right) u(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The orders &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_k&lt;/math&gt; are in general complex quantities, but two interesting cases are when the orders are ''commensurate''

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha_k, \beta_k = k \delta, \quad \delta \in R^+&lt;/math&gt;

and when they are also ''rational'':

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha_k, \beta_k = k \delta, \quad \delta = \frac{1}{q}, q \in Z^+&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;q=1&lt;/math&gt;, the derivatives are of integer order and the system becomes an [[ordinary differential equation]]. Thus by increasing specialization, LTI systems can be of general order, commensurate order, rational order or integer order.

=== Transfer function ===

By applying a [[Laplace transform]] to the LTI system above, the [[transfer function]] becomes

: &lt;math&gt; G(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^n b_k s^{\beta_k}}{\sum_{k=0}^m a_k s^{\alpha_k}}&lt;/math&gt;

For general orders &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_k&lt;/math&gt; this is a non-rational transfer function. Non-rational transfer functions cannot be written as an expansion in a finite number of terms (e.g., a [[binomial expansion]] would have an infinite number of terms) and in this sense fractional orders systems can be said to have the potential for unlimited memory.&lt;ref name=Vinagre2002 /&gt;

==Motivation to study fractional-order systems==

Exponential laws are classical approach to study dynamics of population densities, but there are many systems where dynamics undergo faster or slower-than-exponential laws. In such case the anomalous changes in dynamics may be best described by [[Mittag-Leffler function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Fractional dynamics of populations

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anomalous diffusion]] is one more dynamic system where fractional-order systems play significant role to describe the anomalous flow in the diffusion process.

[[Viscoelasticity]]  is the property of material in which the material exhibits its nature between purely elastic and pure fluid. In case of real materials the relationship between stress and strain given by [[Hooke's law]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's law]] both have obvious disadvances. So [[G. W. Scott Blair]] introduced a new relationship between stress and strain given by

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma (t)=E{D_t^\alpha} \varepsilon(t), \quad 0&lt;\alpha&lt;1. &lt;/math&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In [[chaos theory]], it has been observed that chaos occurs in [[dynamical system]]s of order 3 or more. With the introduction of fractional-order systems, some researchers study chaos in the system of total order less than 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1109/ETFA.2009.5347112|chapter = Fractional - order chaotic systems|title = 2009 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies &amp; Factory Automation|pages = 1–8|year = 2009|last1 = Petras|first1 = Ivo|last2 = Bednarova|first2 = Dagmar|isbn = 978-1-4244-2727-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of fractional differential equations==
Consider a fractional-order [[initial value problem]]:

:&lt;math&gt; {_0^C D_t^\alpha} x(t)=f(t,x(t)) , \quad t\in [0,T], \quad  x(0)=x_0, \quad 0&lt;\alpha&lt;1. &lt;/math&gt;

===Existence and uniqueness===
Here, under the continuity condition on function f, one can convert the above equation into corresponding integral equation.

:&lt;math&gt; x(t)=x_0 + {_0^C D_t^{-\alpha}}f(t,x(t)) = x_0 + \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^t \frac{f(s,x(s))\,ds}{(t-s)^{1-\alpha}},&lt;/math&gt;

One can construct a solution space and define, by that equation, a continuous self-map on the solution space, then apply a [[fixed-point theorem]], to get a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed-point]], which is the solution of above equation.

===Numerical simulation===
For numerical simulation of solution of the above equations, Kai Diethelm has suggested fractional linear multistep [[Linear_multistep_method#Families_of_multistep_methods|Adams–Bashforth method]] or [[Numerical integration#Quadrature rules based on interpolating functions|quadrature methods]].&lt;ref name="Diethelm2006"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diethelm|first1=Kai|title=A Survey of Numerical Methods in Fractional Calculus|url=http://www.lmssc.cnam.fr/sites/default/files/pdf/Colloque_Derivation_Fractionnaire_Cnam_2006_Diethelm.pdf|publisher=CNAM|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Führermuseum''''' ([[English language|English]], '''[[Führer|Leader's]] Museum'''), also referred to as the '''Linz art gallery''', was an unrealized [[art museum]] within a cultural complex planned by [[Adolf Hitler]] for his hometown, the [[Austria]]n city of [[Linz]], near his birthplace of [[Braunau am Inn|Braunau]]. Its purpose was to display a selection of the art bought, [[Nazi plunder|confiscated or stolen by the Nazis]] from throughout [[Europe]] during [[World War II]].  The cultural district was to be part of an overall plan to recreate Linz, turning it into a cultural capital of [[Nazi Germany]] and one of the greatest art centers of Europe, overshadowing [[Vienna]], for which Hitler had a personal distaste.  He wanted to make the city more beautiful than [[Budapest]], so it would be the most beautiful on the [[Danube River]], as well as an industrial powerhouse and a hub of trade; the museum was planned to be one of the greatest in Europe.&lt;ref name=spotts37778&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 377-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=table&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Hitler's Table Talk|Hitler's Table Talk 1941-1944]] |last1=Hitler | first1=Adolf |authorlink1=Adolf Hitler |others= trans.

The expected completion date for the project was 1950, but neither the ''Führermuseum'' nor the cultural center it was to anchor were ever built.  The only part of the elaborate plan which was constructed was the Nibelungen Bridge, which is still extant.&lt;ref name=prerogative /&gt;

==History and design==
[[File:19091216 berlin kaiser friedrich museum.jpg|thumb|left|325px|The [[Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum]] &amp;ndash; now the Bode Museum &amp;ndash; seen here in 1909, may have influenced Hitler's original design for a "German National Gallery".]]

As early as 1925, Hitler had conceived of a "German National Gallery" to be built in Berlin&lt;ref name=spotts187 /&gt; with himself as director.  His plan, drawn out in a sketchbook, may have been influenced by the [[Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum]], and consisted of a building with two sections, one with 28 rooms and the other with 32.&lt;ref name=spotts187 /&gt; Hitler denoted which of his favorite 19th-century German artists were to be collected, and in what rooms their work would hang. Among his favorite painters were [[Hans Makart]], [[Franz Defregger]], Eduard Grützner, [[Franz von Stuck]], [[Franz von Lenbach]], [[Anselm Feuerbach]], Heinrich Zügel and [[Carl Spitzweg]],&lt;ref name=festface&gt;[[Joachim C. Fest|Fest, Joachim]] and Bullock, Michael (trans.) ''The Face of the Third Reich''. New York: Penguin Books, 1979. p. 97 &amp; p. 543 n.19 {{ISBN|978-0201407143}}.  Originally published 1970;&lt;/ref&gt; and he had extolled "Aryan art" by [[Moritz von Schwind]] and [[Arnold Böcklin]] in ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; At one time in his planning he dedicated five of the rooms in the museum to the work of [[Adolph von Menzel]] and three rooms to both Schwind and Böcklin. [[Carl Rottmann]], Edouard von Engerth, and [[Anton von Werner]] were to share a single room, as were Makart and [[Karl von Piloty]]; [[Wilhelm Trübner]] and [[Fritz von Uhde]]; Grützner and Defregger; and the artists of the [[Nazarene movement]]. Other painters who would enjoy their own room in Hitler's original plans were [[Peter von Cornelius]], [[Hans von Marées]], [[Bonaventura Genelli]], [[Anselm Feuerbach]] and [[Wilhelm Leibl]]. These choices reflected Hitler's taste at the time, which was a preference for sentimental 19th-century Germanic romantic painters,&lt;ref name=spotts194&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]]. (1963) ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'' London: Penguin. p. 386. {{ISBN|0-14-013564-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; including "both '[[schmaltz]]y' genre pictures ... [and] heroic, idyllic, allegorical. historical-patriotic themes, the visual equivalent of Wagner, without the genius."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]]. (1991) ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]'' New York: Knopf. pp. 383-84 {{ISBN|0-394-58601-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was after the ''[[Anschluss]]'' with [[Austria]], with the [[House of German Art]] in Munich already completed, that Hitler conceived of having his dream museum not in any of the premiere cities in Germany, where it could be overshadowed, but in his "hometown" of Linz in Austria, and discussed his plans with the director of the local Provincial Museum, Theodor Kerschner, while visiting there.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 188-89&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, after a state trip to [[Rome]], [[Florence]] and [[Naples]] in 1938 &amp;ndash; between the ''Anschluss'' with Austria and the taking of the [[Sudetenland]] from [[Czechoslovakia]] &amp;ndash;  Hitler, "overwhelmed and challenged by the riches of the Italian museums"&lt;ref name=fest&gt;Fest (1975), pp. 530–531&lt;/ref&gt; expanded the conception of his planned gallery. It would now be the unsurpassed art gallery in all of Europe,&lt;ref name=stern /&gt; indeed "the greatest museum in the world",&lt;ref name=fest /&gt; featuring the finest of all European art.  He conceived that the best of Germanic art would have pride of place in the National Gallery in Berlin, while the new museum in Linz would feature the best of the art of the Mediterranean world, especially from the nineteenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Percy Ernst Schramm|Schramm, Percy Ernst]] (1978) "The Anatomy of a Dictator" in ''Hitler: The Man and the Military Leader''. Detwiler, Donald S., ed. Malabar, Florida: Robert E. Kreiger Publishing Company. p. 64 {{isbn|0-89874-962-X}}; originally published as the introduction to [[Henry Picker|Picker, Henry]] (1963) ''Hitlers Tischgespräche im Führerhauptquarter'' ("[[Hitler's Table Talk]]"}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea and overall design concept for a new cultural district in Linz anchored by the ''Führermuseum'' was Hitler's own. He intended Linz to be one of the future cultural capitals of the Reich,&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; to have its own university,&lt;ref name=festface /&gt; and to overshadow [[Vienna]], a city in which he had spent some years as a struggling artist,&lt;ref name=plaut&gt;Plaut (1946)&lt;/ref&gt; and about which he felt considerable distaste,&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 33–36&lt;/ref&gt; not only because of the Jewish influence on the city, but because of his own failure to gain admission to the [[Vienna Academy of Fine Arts]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Hitler] envisaged Linz as the future seat of the new German ''Kultur'', and lavished all his limited pictorial talent and architectural training on a vast project which would realize this ambition.... [He] devoted a disproportionate amount of time and energy, for a chief of state, to the plans for Linz, personally creating the architectural scheme for an imposing array of public buildings, and setting the formula for an art collection which was to specialize heavily in his beloved, mawkish German school of the nineteenth century. His private library, discovered by the American Army deep in Austria, contained scores of completed architectural renderings for the Linz project...&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to one of Hitler's secretaries, he never tired of talking about his planned museum, and it was often the subject at his regular afternoon teas.  He would expound on how the paintings were to be hung: with plenty of space between them, in rooms decorated with furniture and furnishings appropriate to the period, and how they were to be lit.  No detail of the presentation of the artworks was too small for his consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; He said of the museum in 1942 "Anyone who wants to study nineteenth-century painting will sooner or later find it necessary to go to the Linz gallery, because only there will it be possible to find complete collections."&lt;ref name=spotts218&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and model===

In Autumn 1940, Hitler commissioned architect [[Hermann Giesler]], a devout Nazi,&lt;ref&gt;Sereny (1995), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; to be in overall charge of the rebuilding of Linz,&lt;ref name=kershaw777&gt;Kershaw (2000), pp. 777-778&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sereny (1995), pp. 138, 235&lt;/ref&gt; one of the five designated ''[[Führerstadt|Führerstädte]]'' ("Führer cities"), along with [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Nuremberg]] and [[Munich]], which were to be redeveloped drastically.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; Linz was to become a major cultural center, an art capital of Europe, a hub of trade and commerce, and the most beautiful city on the [[Danube River|Danube]], surpassing [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name=spotts37778 /&gt;&lt;ref name=table /&gt;  It would have a new City Hall, new Nazi Party headquarters and a new railway station, a stadium, a community hall, a technical university, an institute of metallurgy, a planetarium, a suspension bridge, and two new towers, one of them with a [[carillon]] and a [[mausoleum]] for Hitler's parents. The city would also have Hitler's own retirement residence, designed by Giesler. In addition to all this, the Vienna facilities of the Hermann-Göring-Werks steel plant were to be moved to Linz as well, over the objections of officials of the city, the architects, and [[Fritz Todt]], who thought the industrial facilities were incompatible with a city of art, architecture and culture. Hitler, though, wanted to provide the city with an ongoing means of income after he was dead and could no longer subsidize it.&lt;ref name=spotts37476&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 374–76&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural center at the heart of the redevelopment, the buildings for which were based on Hitler's ideas and rough designs, came to be referred to as the "European Culture Center". It included a monumental theatre, a concert hall, a library with over 250,000 volumes, an opera house as well as an operetta house, a cinema, a collection of armor and an Adolf Hitler Hotel, all surrounded by huge boulevards and a parade ground.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Citation|last=Bell|first=Bethany|title=Hitler’s Austrian ‘culture capital’|date=3 November 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7705552.stm|accessdate=13 December 2008 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spotts213&gt;Spotts (20020&lt; p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Located south of the historic section of Linz, the main buildings, including the ''Führermuseum'', were to be aligned along one main avenue, In den Lauben,&lt;ref name=spotts37476 /&gt; which after the war was called "a typical National Socialist axis street."&lt;ref name=prerogative /&gt;  It would be anchored at the other end by the new railway station.&lt;ref name=spotts37476 /&gt;

[[File:Bahnhof der Kaiserin-Elisabeth-Bahn - Linz.jpg|thumb|right|287px|Linz's original central [[station building]] where the ''Führermuseum'' was intended to be located; the station would be moved four miles south]]

The design of the many buildings of the cultural center were assigned to various architects Hitler favored.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 213-14; 343&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum itself was designed by [[Roderich Fick]]&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002) p. 214. Spotts refutes other sources, including [[Gitta Sereny]] (1995, p. 718), who report that [[Albert Speer]] was the designer, saying that "Speer had no role in Linz, despite desperate attempts to insert himself."&lt;/ref&gt; based closely on Hitler's sketches and specifications, modeled somewhat after [[Paul Ludwig Troost]]'s ''[[House of German Art|Haus der Deutschen Kunst]]'' ("House of German Art") in [[Munich]] &amp;ndash; itself strongly influenced by Hitler's participation in the design process&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; and would feature a colonnaded facade about 500 feet (150 meters) long. It would stand on the site of the [[Linz Hauptbahnhof|Linz railroad station]], which was to be moved four kilometers to the south.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref name="intelligent-TV"&gt;{{Citation|title= Hitler’s Museum|url= http://www.intelligenttelevision.com/index.php/site/production/hitlers-museum/| accessdate=13 December 2008|website=Intelligent Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Should the volume of German art bought, confiscated and plundered for the museum be such that expansion was needed, an additional building could easily be integrated into the planned district.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

By January 1945, Hitler became obsessed with seeing a model of the planned cultural complex; he had his adjutants and [[Martin Bormann]], his personal secretary and head of the [[Nazi Party Chancellery]], call Giesler's office repeatedly, to ask when the Führer could view the model.  Giesler's office worked around the clock to finish it. The model was finally set up in the cellar of the new [[Reich Chancellery]], and was ready for viewing on 9 February,&lt;ref name=kershaw777 /&gt; when it was examined by Hitler, [[Robert Ley]], the Leader of the German Labor Front, and SS-''Oberguppenfūhrer'' [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], Chief of the Security Police, along with Hitler's personal photographer [[Walter Frentz]] and his valet, [[Heinz Lange]].&lt;ref name=lastdays84&gt;[[Anton Joachimsthaler|Joachimsthaler, Anton]] (1996) ''The Last Days of Hitler: The Legends, the Evidence, the Truth''. Bögler, Helmut (trans.). London: Arms &amp; Armour Press. pp. 84-5&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was apparently entranced by what he saw:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bent over the model, he viewed it from all angles, and in different kinds of lighting.  He asked for a seat.  He checked the proportions of the different buildings.  He asked about the details of the bridges.  He studied the model for a long time, apparently lost in thought.  While Geisler stayed in Berlin, Hitler accompanied him twice daily to view the model, in the afternoon and again during the night.  Others in his entourage were taken down to have his building plans explained to them as they pored over the model. Looking down on the model of a city which, he knew, would never be built, Hitler could fall in reverie, revisiting the fantasies of his youth, when he would dream with his friend Kubizek about rebuilding Linz.&lt;ref name=kershaw777 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hitler visited the model frequently during his time living in the bunker under the Reich Chancellery, spending many hours sitting silently in front of it.&lt;ref name=lastdays84 /&gt; The closer Germany came to military defeat, the more viewing the model became Hitler's only relief; being invited to view it with him was an indication of the Führer's esteem.&lt;ref name="spotts37778"/&gt;

Near the end of the war, when American forces overran Hitler's private library, which was hidden deep in Austria, it contained "scores" of plans and renderings for the museum and the complex. They also found ''The Future Economic Status of the City of Linz'' a 78-page bound volume prepared for Hitler by the  Economic and Research Section of the Oberdonau Department of the Interior, which outlined in detail how the revitalization of Linz would take place. The entire Linz project was treated as a state secret on Hitler's order.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

==Collection==
The collection for the planned museum in Linz was accumulated through several methods.  Hitler himself sent [[Heinrich Heim]], one of Martin Bormann's adjutants who had expertise in paintings and graphics, on trips to Italy and France to buy artworks, which Hitler paid for with his own money, which came from sales of ''Mein Kampf'', real estate speculation on land in the area of [[Berghof (residence)|the ''Berghof'']], Hitler's mountain retreat on the [[Obersalzberg]], and royalties from Hitler's image used on postage stamps.&lt;ref&gt;Sereny (1995), p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, which was divided with his official photographer [[Heinrich Hoffmann (photographer)|Heinrich Hoffmann]], amounted to at least $75 million marks{{clarify|date=September 2018}} over the course of Hitler's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

This, however, was not the primary method used to build up the collection.

===Hitler's birthday===
In Nazi Germany, Hitler's birthday was celebrated nationally on April 20 beginning in 1933, the year Hitler became Chancellor, through 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw|Kershaw, Ian]]. ''The "Hitler Myth": Image and Reality in the Third Reich'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987. pp. 57-59, 64, 72, 79, 141, 151, 159, 197-98, 213-14. {{ISBN|0-19-282234-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his [[Adolf Hitler's 50th Birthday|50th birthday in 1939]], the day was declared a National Holiday. As part of these celebrations Hitler would receive numerous presents, among which were paintings and other art objects.  These were set aside for use in the planned ''Führermuseum'' in Linz.&lt;ref name=stern&gt;[[J. P. Stern|Stern, J. P.]] ''Hitler: The Führer and the People'' Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1992. p. 71.  {{ISBN|0-520-02952-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler's 56th birthday in 1945 was a private celebration held in the bunker under the Reich Chancellery in Berlin as the Soviet [[Red Army]] battled to take the city; even under those circumstances, Hitler would frequently spend hours in the basement of the Chancellery looking at the scale model of the proposed rebuilding of Linz, which centered on the cultural district around the ''Fŭhrermuseum''.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw (2000), pp. 777-78&lt;/ref&gt; Nine days after his birthday, Hitler married [[Eva Braun]], and they committed suicide together the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw (2000), pp. 820-1; 828&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Führer-Reserve''===

In the first weeks after the Anschluss in March 1938, which brought Austria into the German Reich, both the [[Gestapo]] and the [[Nazi Party]] confiscated numerous artworks for themselves.  In response, on 18 June 1938, Hitler issued a decree placing all artwork that had been seized in Austria under the personal prerogative of the Führer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As part of the seizure of assets hostile to the state– especially Jewish assets – in Austria, paintings and other artwork of great value, among other things, have been confiscated. The Führer requests that this artwork, for the most part from Jewish hands, be neither used as furnishings of administration offices or senior bureaucrats’ official residences nor purchased by leading state and party leaders. The Führer plans to personally decide on the use of the property after its seizure. He is considering putting artwork first and foremost at the disposal of small Austrian towns for their collections.&lt;ref&gt;Decree issued by Reich Minister and Head of the Chancellery of the Reich, June 18, 1938. Vienna, Federal Office for the Protection of Monuments, archive, restitution files, box 8/1, fascicle 1. As facsimile in: Theodor Brückler (publ.), Kunstraub, Kunstbergung und Restitution in Österreich 1938 bis heute, Vienna-Cologne-Weimar, 1999, at 157. quoted in [https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114537/http://www.artrestitution.at/F.prerogative.html "The Führer’s prerogative and the planned Führer Museum in Linz"] Art Database of the National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The intent of the order was to guarantee that Hitler would have first choice of the plundered art for his planned ''Führermuseum'' and for other museums in the Reich.&lt;ref name=prerogative&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114537/http://www.artrestitution.at/F.prerogative.html "The Führer’s prerogative and the planned Führer Museum in Linz"] Art Database of the National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (2004), pp. 83-110.&lt;/ref&gt;  This later became a standard procedure for all purloined or confiscated art, and was known as the "''Führer-Reserve.''"&lt;ref name=spotts198&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sonderauftrag Linz''===

On 21 June 1939, Hitler set up the ''Sonderauftrag Linz'' ("Special Commission: Linz") in [[Dresden]] and appointed [[Hans Posse]], director of the ''[[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]]'' ("Dresden Painting Gallery"), as a special envoy. A few days later, on 26 June, Hitler signed a letter intended to give Posse the authority he would need to do this job.  He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I commission Dr. Hans Posse, Director of Dresden Gallery, to build up the new art museum for Linz Donau.  All Party and State services are ordered to assist Dr. Posse in fulfillment of his mission.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1994-006-28A, Dr. Hans Posse crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|[[Hans Posse]] in 1938]]

Posse had a checkered relationship with the National Socialists. His wife had joined the Nazi Party in 1932, but when Posse himself tried to join in 1933, his application was rejected a year later. He was later accused of having promoted so-called "[[Degenerate art]]", and of having Jewish ancestry. In 1938 he was asked to resign as director &amp;ndash; a position he had held since 1910 from the age of 31 &amp;ndash; but refused, taking a leave of absence instead. He was nevertheless fired, only to be restored to the position on Hitler's orders, possibly through the influence of art dealer [[Karl Haberstock]].&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 189-191&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hitler had favored German and Austrian paintings from the 19th century, Posse's focus was on early German, Dutch, French, and Italian paintings.&lt;ref name=history&gt;Enderlein, Angelika; Flacke, Monika and Löhr, Hanns Christian. [http://www.dhm.de/datenbank/linzdb/einleitunge.html "Database on the Sonderauftrag Linz (Special Commission: Linz): History of the Linz collection] [[German Historical Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Posse wrote in his diary that Hitler intended the museum to hold "only the best of all periods from the prehistoric beginnings of art...to the nineteenth century and recent times." Hitler told Posse that he was only to answer to him.&lt;ref name=spotts187&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sonderauftrag'' not only collected art for the ''Führermuseum'', but also for other museums in the German Reich, especially in the eastern territories. The artworks would have been distributed to these museums after the war. The ''Sonderauftrag'' was located in Dresden had approximately 20 specialists attached to it: "curators of paintings, prints, coins, and armor, a librarian, an architect, an administrator, photographers, and restorers."&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; The staff included Robert Oertel and Gottfried Reimer of the Dresden Gallery, Friedrich Wolffhardt, an SS officer, as curator of books and autographs; Leopold Rupprecht of the ''[[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]'' as curator for armour, and Fritz Dworschak, also of that museum, as curator for coins.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 192-93; 212&lt;/ref&gt;

====Under Hans Posse====
On 24 July 1939, [[Martin Bormann]], Deputy Führer [[Rudolf Hess]]'s assistant, informed [[Josef Bürckel]], who Hitler had appointed to head the administration of Austria after the [[Anschluss]], that all artwork which was confiscated was to be made available for examination by Posse or by Hitler personally. Although the order did not originally include the artworks taken earlier from the Vienna [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]], by October Posse had managed to get those included in his remit as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans|Evans, Richard J.]] (2005) ''[[The Third Reich in Power]]''. New York: [[Penguin Books]]. p.662. {{isbn|0-14-303790-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late summer and autumn of that year, Posse traveled a number of times to Vienna to the Central Depot for confiscated art in the Neue Burg to pick out art pieces for the Linz museum,&lt;ref name=prerogative /&gt; and in October he gave to Bormann, for Hitler's approval, the list of artworks confiscated from the Rothschilds which Posse had selected for the museum.   These included works by [[Hans Holbein the Elder]], [[van Dyck]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Gerard ter Borch]] and [[Francesco Guardi]], among others.&lt;ref name=spotts198/&gt; These 182 pieces were also included in Posse's July 1940 list of 324 paintings he had chosen for the museum's collection.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;  

On 13 June 1940, Hitler authorized Posee to travel to Holland, where he had to compete with [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s ERR organization ([[#Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR)|see below]]), [[Kajetan Mǔhllman]], [[Herman Gõring]]'s art curator [[Walter Hofer|Walter Andres Hofer]] and Goring himself in claiming works by Dutch masters, many of which had been purloined, expropriated or confiscated by various Nazi agencies on a number of grounds.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;

Posse went to Poland around November 1940 to examine expropriated artworks there, some of which had been looted by the German Army from museums, palaces and country homes. All of the country's artworks in the German-occupied areas were then cataloged by SS officer and art historian [[Kajetan Mühlmann]], who had done the same previously in Vienna.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;  Posse selected works by [[Leonardo]], [[Raphael]], and [[Rembrandt]] for the museum in Linz, although these pieces never actually left the control of the [[General Government]], the Nazi-occupied rump of Poland left after Germany and the Soviet Union took the territory they wanted.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

On 10 June 1940, Posse wrote to Bormann:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The special delegate for the safeguarding of art and cultural properties has just returned from Holland. He notified me today that there exists at the moment a particularly favorable opportunity to purchase valuable works of art from Dutch dealers and private owners in German currency. Even though a large number of important works have doubtless been removed recently from Holland, I believe that the trade still contains many objects which are desirable for the Führer's collection, and which may be acquired without foreign exchange.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a result of this, accounts of about 500,000 ''Reichsmarks'' were opened in Paris and Rome for Posse's personal use, and, around July 1940, he expanded the scope of the ''Sonderauftrag Linz'' into [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] when he established an office in [[The Hague]] as ''Referent für Sonderfragen'' (Adviser on "Special Questions"). Posse was able to report to Bormann that as of March 1941 he had spent 8,522,348 ''Reichsmarks'' on artworks for the ''Führermuseum''.  He later bought most of the Mannheimer Collection in 1944, including [[Rembrandt]]'s ''Jewish Doctor'' &amp;ndash; assisted by the threat of confiscation from the Nazi government of [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] &amp;ndash; with the remainder of the collection being purchased in the same manner in France later on.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; The collecting of the ''Sonderauftrag Linz'' includes many such cases of forced sale, using funds from sales of Hitler's book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and stamps showing his portrait.  Members of the ''Sonderauftrag Linz'' made a considerable number of purchasing trips throughout Europe, acquiring a significant number of artworks, and also arranged purchases through art dealers.&lt;ref name=prerogative /&gt;&lt;ref name="museum-security"&gt;{{Citation|last=Lohr|first=Hanns|title=No Looted Art in Hitler's Museum in Linz|date=20 November 2000|url=http://www.museum-security.org/00/201.html|accessdate=13 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521155013/http://www.museum-security.org/00/201.html|archivedate=21 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{Cite news|last=DW Staff|title=The Mystery of Hitler's Lost Art Collection |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=24 August 2008 |url= http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1689856,00.html |accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler was pleased with Posse's work, and in 1940 awarded him the honorific of "Professor",&lt;ref name=spotts193&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; something the Führer did for many of his favorites in the arts, such as [[Leni Riefenstahl]], the actress and film director; architects [[Albert Speer]] and [[Hermann Giesler]]; sculptors [[Arno Breker]] and [[Josef Thorak]]; [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]], conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]]; actor [[Emil Jannings]]; and photographer [[Heinrich Hoffmann (photographer)|Heinrich Hoffmann]]; among others.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton Joachimsthaler|Joachimsthaler, Anton]] 'ü'The Last Days of Hitler: The Legends, the Evidence, the Truth''. (Helmut Bögler, trans) London: Brockhampton Press, 1999. p. 304 {{ISBN|978-1-86019-902-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1939, Hitler and [[Benito Mussolini]] had made an agreement that any Germanic artworks in public museums in the [[South Tyrol]] &amp;ndash; a traditionally German-speaking area which had been given to Italy after the First World War in return for entering the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]] &amp;ndash; could be removed and returned to Germany, but when Posse attempted to do so, with the assistance of [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s ''[[Ahnenerbe]]'', the Italians managed to keep putting things off, and no repatriations ever took place.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

Posse died in December 1942 of cancer. His funeral was a high state event to which Hitler invited the directors of all art museums in the Reich; Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] delivered the eulogy, although there was no mention made of the Linz Museum project, since it was a state secret Posse had gathered more than 2500 artworks for the Linz museum in the three years he was head of the ''Sonderauftrag Linz''.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 191; 193&lt;/ref&gt;

====Under Hermann Voss====
In March 1943, [[:de:Hermann Voss (Kunsthistoriker)|Hermann Voss]], an art historian, director of the [[Wiesbaden]] Gallery and former deputy director of the [[Kaiser Friedrich Museum]] in Berlin&lt;ref name=prerogative /&gt; took over the Special Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Birgit. "Sonderauftrag Linz km und „Führermuseum“", in ''Ausst.-Kat. Raub und Restitution'', Berlin: [[Jüdisches Museum Berlin]], 2008. pp. 127–133. {{ISBN|978-3-8353-0361-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His appointment was considered odd by some, since he was known to be an anti-Nazi with a considerable number of Jewish friends and colleagues, but Hitler was known to overlook political factors when dealing with matters of art, and Voss's knowledge of southern German artwork, as well as French and Italian painting, may have decided the matter for him.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref name=spotts192&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Voss was not nearly as active or energetic as Posse had been, and was prone to send out agents rather than to travel himself to make purchases, or to make dealers bring works to him.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref name=spotts193 /&gt;

Hitler's relationship with Voss was not as warm as with Posse.  The two men met only on several occasions, and Voss was not given authority over books, armour and coins, as Posse had been.  Voss is said to have remarked after one meeting with the Führer, "He's even worse than I thought."  Voss attempted to mend his fences with Hitler with an elaborate gift for his birthday in 1944, accompanied by a list of his acquisitions in which he claimed to have bought 881 items, compared to 122 paintings that Posse had collected the year before.  Voss did indeed spend money more profligately than Posse had, and his budget was later reduced near the end of the war.&lt;ref name=spotts193/&gt; Under interrogation after the war he claimed to have acquired 3000 painting for the ''Führermuseum'' between 1943 and 1944, although the records do not support this figure, and many of the artworks were of distinctly secondary importance.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

In April 1943, the German public first heard about the Linz project in a special edition of Heinrich Hoffmann's art magazine ''Kunst dem Volk'' ("Art to the People"). It revealed both the intention to build a great art gallery in Linz and the existence of the collection which had been amassed for it, although, of course, nothing was said about the methods used to acquire many of the pieces. The magazine featured colored plates of works in the collection by [[Rembrandt]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Pieter Breughel the Elder|Breughel]] and [[Vermeer]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002) pp. 193-94&lt;/ref&gt;  Up to that time, only two works which had been collected for the Linz museum had been seen by the public &amp;ndash; but without disclosure of where they were eventually designated to go &amp;ndash; the first was [[Myron]]'s sculpture ''Discobolus'' ("The Discus Thrower"), which Hitler obtained surreptitiously in 1938 through the Berlin State Museum, but ordered to be displayed at the ''Glyptothek'' in Munich, where he proudly told his invited guests at the unveiling "May you all then realize how glorious man already was back then in his physical beauty".  The other work was Makart's triptych ''The Plague in Florence'', which Hitler acquired as a gift from Mussolini, who, when the owners refused to sell it, seized their villa and confiscated the painting, which he presented to the Führer at the train station in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 21; 209&lt;/ref&gt;

====Results====
By December 1944, Posse and Voss had collectively spent 70 million Reichsmarks on accumulating the collection intended for the ''Fuhrermuseum''; although it should be noted that artworks bought in [[Vichy France]] were paid for with francs which were set by the Nazis at an artificially low exchange rate with the Reichmark. In 1945, the count of art items in the collection was over 8,000.&lt;ref name=evans&gt;[[Richard J. Evans|Evans, Richard J.]] (2008) ''[[The Third Reich at War]]''. New York: [[Penguin Books]]. p.588-92. {{isbn|978-0-14-311671-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal authority====
The legal authority for the collection of artworks for the ''Führermuseum'' began with Hitler himself, who, after the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], had the power to enact laws without involving the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]].  In effect, whatever Hitler directed to be done had the force of law.  It was his personal desire for the creation of a museum and the revitalization of Linz which began the collection program. Martin Bormann, who became chief of the Nazi Party Chancellery and also Hitler's private secretary, was also closely connected to the program from the beginning, in particular as a conduit through which to access Hitler.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; He acted as the Chief of Staff for the ''Sonderauftrag Linz''.&lt;ref name=spotts192 /&gt;

On the next level of hierarchy, Reichsminister [[Hans Lammers]], who was President of the [[Reich Chancellery]], and Helmut von Hummel, Bormann's Special Assistant and "a particularly viscious Nazi", actually drew up the directives which set out the policies and procedures which governed the collecting process, both for confiscations and purchases.  The financing and administration of the Linz program was their responsibility.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; von Hummel had replaced Kurt Hanssen.&lt;ref name=spotts192 /&gt;

Other Nazi officials involved in the confiscation of art, but not specifically with collection for the Linz museum, included the Reich Minister for Science, Education, and Culture, [[Bernhard Rust]]; the Governor General for Poland, [[Hans Frank]]; and Heinrich Himmler, chief of the SS.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

====Photograph albums====

Birgit Schwarz published in 2004 19 photograph albums as documents of the intended gallery holdings. These "Führer albums", which were created between autumn 1940 and autumn 1944, were presented to Hitler every Christmas and on his birthday, 20 April. Originally thirty-one volumes existed, but only nineteen have been preserved in Germany, and 11 are considered to be lost.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; The albums are documents of the intended gallery holdings and are the most important historical and visual sources relating to the gallery of the ''Führermuseum''.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Birgit. "Hitler's Museum", in ''Vitalizing Memory''. Washington: International Perspectives on Provenance Research, 2005, S. pp. 51-54&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the collection included three Rembrandts, ''La Danse'' by [[Watteau]], the Memling portrait by Corsini, the [[Rubens]] ''Ganymede'', and [[Vermeer]]'s ''The Artist in His Studio'', a forced sale at a knock-down price.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

===''Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg'' (ERR)===
In the "authoritarian anarchy"&lt;ref&gt;Fest (1975), p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; and "administrative chaos"&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw (2000), p. 569&lt;/ref&gt; that was typical of the way the Third Reich operated, the ''Sonderauftrag Linz'' was not the only Nazi agency collecting artworks. In France, as in [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|many other countries in Europe]], the office of ''[[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]]'' (Special Purposes Reich Leader Rosenberg) was the primary agency.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; On 5 November 1940, a directive from ''Reichsmarchall'' [[Hermann Göring]] to [[Alfred Rosenberg]], the head of the ERR, and to the Chief of Military Administration in Paris outlines the several categories of "ownerless" art confiscated from Jews for "safeguarding".  One of the categories were "Those art objects for the further disposition of which the Führer has reserved for himself the right of decision," while other categories were those works desired by Göring himself, those destined for German museums other than the ''Führermuseum''.  Although the directive was intended to be effective immediately, Göring indicates that he had yet to clear it with Hitler, but intended to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler then issued on 18 November his own directive, a ''Führerbefehl'' similar to the ones he had issued for Poland and Austria, announcing his prerogative over all confiscated art in the occupied Western territories. Rosenberg thus became a formal procurement agent for the ''Führermuseum'', except when Göring intervened.  This apparently brought about some internecine squabbling, as Dr. Posse had been given the authority to act on Hitler's behalf, and the German commanders of occupied countries were required to keep him regularly informed about their confiscations of artwork. Probably because of Göring's interference, Posse formally requested that the Reich Chancellery reiterate his power to act for the ''Führer''.  The result was a "general high-level directive" confirming Hitler's primacy through Posse, and a direction to Posse to review the ERR's inventory in regard to the needs of the planned museum in Linz.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

On 20 March 1941, Rosenberg reported that his unit had proceeded to follow the directive, having "collected" over 4000 items; those personally selected by Göring had already been shipped by train to the air-raid shelters of the Führer Building in Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;  Several years later, on 16 April 1943, Rosenberg sent Hitler photographs of some of the more valuable paintings confiscated from the Western Occupied Territories, to add to the 53 photographs he had sent earlier.  Rosenberg asked for permission to see Hitler personally, to present a catalog of works seized, as well as 20 additional folders of photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

By one conservative estimate, about 21,903 objects were confiscated from France.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Burleigh|Burleigh. Michael]] ''Moral Combay: Good and Evil in World War II'' New York: Harper, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-06-058097-1}}. p.211&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, about 700 went to Göring. 53 were earmarked for the Führermuseum in Linz.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; Rosenberg kept the rest under his own control until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.zikg.eu/forschung/redaktion-kunstchronik/inhaltsverzeichnisse/pdf/heft-1-januar-2016-1|title = Neufund, Ein neues Dokument zum "Sonderauftrag Linz|last = Loehr|first = Hanns Christian|date = 4 January 2016|journal = Kunstchronik|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[German Historic Museum]] of Berlin published a database&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhm.de/datenbank/linzdb/indexe.html "Database on the Sonderauftrag Linz (Special Commission: Linz)"] [[German Historic Museum|Deutsches Historisches Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; with paintings collected for the ''Führermuseum'' and for other museums in the German Reich.

====Wolff-Metternich, Jaujard and Valland====
The German occupation of [[Paris]] began on 14 June 1940, and on 30 June Hitler ordered that artworks in the French national collection be "safeguarded", and in particular "ownerless" art and historical documents &amp;ndash; meaning works which were the property of Jews and could therefore be confiscated from them &amp;ndash; be "protected" as well. Three days later, the German ambassador in France, [[Otto Abetz]], ordered the confiscation of the collections of the 15 most important art dealers in the city, most of whom were Jewish.  These pieces were then brought to the German Embassy.  Through the actions of Count Franz von Wolff-Metternich, the head of the ''[[Kunstschutz]]'' (Art Protection) &amp;ndash; an agency which dated from [[World War I]] and which had a mission which was superficially similar to that of the Allied [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] (MFAA) &amp;ndash; Nazi military authorities intervened and stopped Abetz from making any more confiscations.  Most of the artwork in the Embassy was then transferred for storage to the [[Louvre]], at the suggestion of [[Jacques Jaujard]], the Director of French National Museums.&lt;ref name=wolff&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 126-130&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolff-Metternich continued in his efforts to protect the artworks, which what he saw as the proper role of his agency.  In particular, he was able to fend off [[Joseph Goebbels]]' demand that almost a thousand pieces of "Germanic" art held in the collection of confiscated pieces be shipped immediately to Germany.  Wolff-Metternich did not disagree that the artworks properly belonged in the Reich, but did not think that sending them at the time was the correct course of action, and held off Goebbels with bureaucratic maneuvers and a strict interpretation of Hitler's directive, which specified that artwork in France should not be moved until a peace treaty between France and German had been signed, which had not as yet occurred.&lt;ref name=wolff /&gt;

The collection of artwork in the Louvre was destined to survive the war, and was not subjected to predation from the various Nazi entities confiscating and collecting artwork for shipment back to Germany, including those doing so for Hitler's planned museum in Linz.  Wolff-Metternich was eventually removed from his office, as he was not pliable enough to provide the veneer of legality that was wanted by the Nazi authorities.  Jaujard was fired as well after his vehement protest over the German theft of the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] in 1942, but when the staffs of every French museum resigned in protest over his dismissal, the Nazis were forced to restore him to his office, where he was able to continue to safeguard the French national collection, and provide assistance to the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].&lt;ref name=wolff /&gt;

Jaujard, however, could do very little to protect the private art collections of Paris and France from the predations of the ERR.  These collections &amp;ndash; those of the French [[Rothschilds]]; [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], the art dealer; [[Georges Wildenstein|Georges]] and [[Daniel Wildenstein]]; the investment banker [[Pierre David-Weill]]; [[Germain Seligman]], the art historian and dealer; [[Alphonse Kann]]; and the other great collectors of the time&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 158, 196&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; were systematically subjected to confiscations under various bureaucratically outlined pretenses of "protection", and were then brought to the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|''Jeu de Paume'']] museum, where they were [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume#Nazi sroting house|cataloged and divided up]] for Hitler's collection &amp;ndash; Posse took 53 paintings,&lt;ref name=evans /&gt; for Göring's, for the use of Alfred Rosenberg's "scholarly" institutions which were attempting to prove the inferiority of Jews, as well as for other purposes.  Fortunately, [[Rose Valland]] &amp;ndash; at the time an unpaid museum employee, later the museum's ''attaché'' and ''Assistante'',&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 194, 201-202&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; was a member of the [[French resistance]], and had remained working at the museum on Jaujard's orders. Valland kept lists of all the works which came in, the secret storehouses where they were stockpiled when they left the museum, and the numbers of the train cars when the last of the paintings were shipped to Germany just before the Allied recapturing of Paris.  Using Valland's information, the Resistance was able to delay the train sufficiently so that it never reached Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 160-63, 177-189&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1979-089-22, Hermann Göring crop.jpg|thumb|left|167px|Hermann Göring in 1942]]

====Hermann Göring====
Although the ERR, in theory, was part of Alfred Rosenberg's Nazi empire, Rosenberg was an ideologue who had no interest in art, and did not appreciate the value to Germany of looting the patrimony of the occupied countries.  ''Reichsmarschall'' Hermann Göring, on the other hand, Hitler's anointed successor and the head of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', was an avid collector of confiscated artworks, with an unquenchable appetite for jewels and finery as well.  As a result, the ERR in France became in large part "Göring's personal looting organization."&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 197-201&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the war, Göring paid 20 visits to the ''Jeu de Paume'' in Paris to views the results of the ERR's confiscations.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), caption to 10th photograph between pp. 208-10&lt;/ref&gt;  At times Göring also utilized  [[Kajetan Mühlmann]], an Austrian art historian and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer, as his personal agent.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;

On occasion, Göring's desires conflicted with those of Hitler and Hitler's agents.  When this occurred, Göring gave way, not wanting to provoke trouble with the ''Führer''.  Several times, he also made "gifts" to the collection of the ''Führermuseum''.  He sent 53 pieces from the French Rothschild Collection, which had been confiscated in Paris for him by the ERR, to Munich to be held for the Linz museum,&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; including [[Vermeer]]'s [[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|''The Astronomer'']], sent in November 1940,&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; and which became Hitler's most cherished painting in his collection.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, in 1945, Göring gave Hitler 17 paintings and 4 bronzes from the [[Naples Museum]].  These had been confiscated by the Hermann Göring Panzer Division while they were being shipped to safety from [[Monte Cassino]] to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], and were later presented to the ''Reichsmarschall'' at [[Carinhall]],&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; his "hunting lodge/art gallery/imperial palace."&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak, Göring's art collection included 1,375 paintings, 250 sculptures and 168 tapestries.  Its value has been estimated at several hundred million marks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Burleigh|Burleigh, Michael]]. ''Moral Combat: Good and Evil in World War II'' New York: Harper, 2011.  {{ISBN|978-0-06-058097-1}}. p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Soviet Army was about to cross the [[Oder River]] into Germany in February 1945, threatening Carinhall, Göring began to evacuate his art collection by train, sending it to his other residences in the south of Germany.  A second trainload went out in March. and a third in April.  The contents of the shipments were personally chosen by Göring, who, at first, was inclined not to take the artwork he had acquired through the confiscations of the ERR, in case there might be questions of provenance in the future, but he was dissuaded from this course by Walter Andreas Hoffer, who was in charge of Göring's collection.  Even after the contents of three long trains had left, Carinhall still had a considerable amount of art left in it, statues buried around the grounds, and looted furniture still in the rooms. Göring had ''Luftwaffe'' demolition experts wire the estate for destruction, so the treasures he had left behind would not fall into the hands of the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 239-41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dealers and agents===

A number of art dealers and private individuals profited greatly from Hitler's campaign to stock his planned museum.  Primary among them was [[Karl Haberstock]], who operated a wide network of German agents in Paris, the south of France, the Netherlands and Switzerland, but also at least 75 French collaborators.  Haberstock declined to take a commission on the major purchases for the museum, but took his regular fee otherwise, amassing a fortune.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; Thanks to his relationships with Hans Posse and with Hitler, he sold over 100 paintings designated for the Linz collection.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;  When Posse went to France under Hitler's orders, he took the unscrupulous Haberstock with him, and the dealer, working through 82 local agents, purchased 62 pieces for the Linz collection, including works by [[Rembrandt]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Brueghel]], [[Watteau]] and [[Rubens]].&lt;ref name=spotts206&gt;Spotts (2002) p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wilhelm Trübner Karl Haberstock black and white.jpg|thumb|right|212px|[[Karl Haberstock]] in 1914]]

Maria Almas Dietrich was another art dealer who did well by the Nazi obsession with obtaining art.  An acquaintance of Hitler through his official photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann, Dietrich sold 80 paintings to the Linz museum collection, and a further 270 for Hitler's personal collection, as well as over 300 for other German museums and Nazi Party functionaries.  Prolific rather than knowledgeable, Dietrich still managed to make a considerable amount of money from the Linz program.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;  She also managed to avoid being sent to a concentration camp, despite having a Jewish father, bearing a child with her Jewish lover, and marrying a Jew from Turkey, although she renounced Judaism after divorcing him. Hitler, despite his rabid anti-Semitism, was frequently, but not consistently, an unconventional Nazi when it came to Jews involved in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 84; 202&lt;/ref&gt;  It may also have helped that Hitler's mistress Eva Braun was a friend of Dietrich's daughter.&lt;ref name=spotts203&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Dietrich, [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]-''[[Gruppenführer]]'' [[Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse|Prince Philipp of Hessen]] was a connoisseur of the arts and architecture and acted as Posse's principal agent in Italy, where he lived with his wife, a daughter of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel]]. A grandson of the German Emperor [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]], and a great-grandson of [[Queen Victoria]], Philipp provided "a veneer of aristocratic elegance which facilitated important purchases from the Italian nobility."&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;  Philipp assisted Posse in purchasing 90 paintings from Italy, and bought several more for the Linz collection on his own account.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

Another dealer used by Hans Posse was [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], through whom he made expensive purchases of tapestries, paintings and drawings.&lt;ref name=spotts206 /&gt;

Other Nazi agents in the Linz program included [[Kajetan Mühlmann]], a high [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] official whose territories were Poland and the Netherlands; Baron Kurt von Behr, the head of the ERR in France; and Hitler's photographer Heinrich Hoffmann, an early art adviser who fell from Hitler's favor after 1941, due to Martin Bormann's dislike of him, but who had acted as an intermediary between some German art dealers and the Linz program, and possibly did the same in the Netherlands as well.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

===Confiscated or bought?===
There is some debate about whether art for the ''Führermuseum'' was primarily stolen or purchased. Hanns Christian Löhr argues in ''Das Braune Haus der Kunst: Hitler und der "Sonderauftrag Linz"'' ("The Brown House of Art and the 'Sonderauftrag Linz'") that only a small portion of the collection – possibly 12 percent – came from seizures or expropriation. Moreover, another 2.5% was derived from forced sales.&lt;ref&gt;Löhr, Hanns Christian. ''Das Braune Haus der Kunst: Hitler und der "Sonderauftrag Linz"''. Berlin Akademie Verlag, 2005. {{ISBN|978-3-05-004156-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Jonathan Petropoulos]], a historian at [[Loyola University Maryland|Loyola College]] in [[Baltimore]] and an expert in wartime looting, argues that most of the purchases were not "[[Arm's length principle|arm's length]]" in nature.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Robinson|first=Walter|date=25 November 1997|title=Sotheby's takes work tied to Nazis off| url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/paintings/112597.htm |accessdate=13 December 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030418024422/http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/paintings/112597.htm |archivedate = 18 April 2003 |work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:nl:Gerard Aalders|Gerard Aalders]], a Dutch historian, said those sales amounted to "technical looting," since the Netherlands and other occupied countries were forced to accept German ''Reichsmarks'' that ultimately proved worthless. Aalders argues that "If Hitler's or Goering's art agent stood on your doorstep and offered $10,000 for the painting instead of the $100,000 it was really worth, it was pretty hard to refuse." He adds that Nazis who encountered reluctant sellers threatened to confiscate the art or arrest the owner.&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"/&gt; Birgit Schwarz, an expert on the ''Führermuseum'', in her review of Löhr's book, pointed out that the author focused on the purchases which were held in the ''Führerbau'' in Munich and ignored the deposits of looted art in [[Upper Austria]] in Thürntal, [[Kremsmünster]] and Hohenfurt/[[Vyssi Brod]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Birgit. "Kampf der Zentauren daheim"  [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], (17 October 2005), p. 40; actually, Lohr treats these deposits on pages 135 and 136 of his book&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of purchases versus confiscations, Dr. Cris Whetton, the author of ''Hitler's Fortune''&lt;ref&gt;Whetton, Cris. ''Hitler's Fortune''. Barnsley: Pen and Sword (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had expected to find that [Hitler] was directly responsible for looting and stealing of paintings that he wanted for himself, and I couldn't find any evidence of it, I found evidence that he ''paid'' for them; sometimes at knock-down prices, but not direct theft in any way.  I was quite surprised by this, and I have to say in all honesty that's what I found.&lt;ref&gt;Interviewed on ''Hitler's Riches''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Dutch Advisory Committee on the Assessment of Restitution Applications for Items of Cultural Value and the Second World War assesses sales by Dutch Jews to the ''Sonderauftrag Linz''. At least two restitution claims were rejected because the Committee argued that there were not enough indications showing coercion as the cause of the sale. For example, in 2009 the Restitution Committee rejected the application for the restitution of 12 works sold by the Jewish art dealer [[Kurt Walter Bachstitz]] to the ''Sonderauftrag Linz'' between 1940 and 1941. The Committee argued that Bachstitz had been "undisturbed" in the first years of the occupation and said it had not found signs of coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title= Dutch Restitution Commission RC 1.78, Consideration 5 and 16|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/en/adviezen/advies_178.html/|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the Commission rejected a claim of the heirs of Benjamin and Nathan Katz, former Jewish art dealers in the Netherlands. The claim related ''inter alia'' to 64 works that the art dealership Katz sold to the ''Sonderauftrag Linz''. The Commission came to the conclusion that there were not enough indications demonstrating that the sales were made under duress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Dutch Restitution Commission RC 1.90 B, Consideration 21|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/en/files/advies_rc_190b_pdf.html/|accessdate=7 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408212855/http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/en/files/advies_rc_190b_pdf.html/|archivedate=8 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works which Hans Posse purchased in Vienna for the Linz collection included [[Vermeer]]'s ''[[The Artist in his Studio]]'', [[Titian]]'s ''[[The Toilet of Venus]]'', [[Antonio Canova]]'s ''Polyhymnia'', and several works by [[Rembrandt]].  Among the many paintings Karl Haberstock sold to the collection were two Rembrandts, one of which, ''Portrait of Hendrickje Stoffels'' is now thought to be from the Rembrandt workshop and not a work of the master.  Oddly, Hitler purchased these for an inflated price, despite the fact that seller was a partly Jewish woman and the paintings could have been confiscated.  Posse also purchased over 200 pieces which Jewish owners had managed to get into Switzerland, where they were safe from expropriation.  On the other hand, Posse did not shy away from confiscation either, particular in the former Czechoslovakia and Poland, where all property was subject to it, but also in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=spotts198plus&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 198-202&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hitler 20 April 1945.jpg|thumb|Hitler on 20 April 1945 in his last public appearance, in the garden of the [[Reich Chancellery]], ten days before he and [[Eva Braun]] committed suicide]]

===Size of the collection and Hitler's will===
It is not possible to determine with any accuracy the size of the collection which had been amassed for Hitler's planned museum in Linz, but Frederick Spotts suggests that something around 7,000 pieces had been confiscated, bought or purloined specifically for the ''Führermuseum'', and that others from the many other art repositories scattered around Germany would most probably have been added had Hitler won the war and he and his art experts had the opportunity to sort through the artworks and assign them to various museums.  According to Spotts the figure of 7,000 accords well with the data released by the Art Looting Investigation Unit.&lt;ref name=spotts2167&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 216–17&lt;/ref&gt;  Other experts quote higher figures of up to 8,500 for the ultimate size of the collection.&lt;ref name=barker&gt;Art historian [[Godfrey Barker]], interviewed on ''Hitler's Riches''&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its size, and the unprecedented access Hitler' agents had to artworks throughout Occupied Europe, the Linz collection had noticeable flaws.  According to Spotts, its "gaps" included [[English art]], [[Spanish art]] and art of the [[Northern Renaissance]]; major artists were missing from the [[Italian art|Italian]] part of the collection as well.&lt;ref name=spotts218 /&gt;

Whatever its size and quality, near the end of the war Hitler wanted it understood that he meant the collection to be for the public &amp;ndash; even though there were hundreds of artworks that were specifically marked for use in the ''[[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]]'', his mountain retreat, and for a castle in [[Poznań|Posen]] which Hitler intended as another residence.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Still, in the "Private Testament" he drew up the day before his death, he specified that the collection should go to the museum when it was built, writing that they were "never collected for private purposes, but always only for the expansion of a gallery in my hometown of Linz on the Danube."&lt;ref&gt;Fest (1975), p. 747&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=riches&gt;''Hitler's Riches''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw (2000), p. 821&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage and recovery==

===Repositories===
{{see also|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program#Art repositories}}

The artworks collected for the ''Führermuseum'' were originally stored in a number of places. The purchases were mostly kept in the air raid shelters of the ''Führerbau'' in [[Munich]] &amp;ndash; one of a number of large buildings Hitler had built in the birthplace of the Nazi Party &amp;ndash; where they were under the control of the Nazi Party Chancellery; Hitler would often come to visit them and indulge in long discussions on art as one of the first tasks when coming to Munich, even during the war.&lt;ref name=fest /&gt; Confiscated artworks were stored in deposits in the area of Upper Austria, located in the middle of forests or in the mountains.  The ERR alone requisitioned six estates for storage, including [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] in the [[Bavarian Alps]], in which items from France were stored; the [[Benedictine monastery]] on the island of [[Frauenchiemsee]] in the [[Chiemsee]] lake, halfway between Munich and [[Salzburg]]; an estate in the [[Salzkammergut]] hills, which had been a summer residence for the Austrian royal family; and the [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]'s hunting lodge.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

Rose Valland eventually shared the trove of information she had gathered at the ''Jeu de Paume'' museum, while the Nazis were using it as a way-station for confiscated art, with 1st Lt. James Rorimer, one of the "Monuments Men" of the [[MFAA]], who would be attached to the U.S. Seventh Army. It would overrun the places in southern Germany &amp;ndash; [[Heilbronn]], Baxheim, [[Hohenschwangau]] and [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] &amp;ndash; which Valland was certain were the locations of the repositories of much of the ERR-looted art which had been shipped back to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 245-49&lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Walker Hancock, the Monuments officer for the U.S. First Army, learned the locations of 109 art repositories in Germany east of [[the Rhine]] from the former assistant of Count Wolff-Metternich of the ''Kunstschutz'', thereby doubling the number of repositories known at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 255-58&lt;/ref&gt; Additional information came to Monuments Men Captain Robert Posey and Private [[Lincoln Kirstein]], who were attached to the U.S. Third Army, from Hermann Bunjes, a corrupted art scholar and former SS Captain who had been deeply involved in the ERR's ''Jeu de Paume'' operation on behalf of Hermann Göring.  From Bunjes came the information that Göring had moved his collection out of Carinhall, and, most importantly, the revelation of the existence of a massive repository in the [[Altaussee|Altaussee salt mines]], which included much of Hitler's collection intended for the ''Fuhrermuseum'' in Linz.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 178, 263-69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StollenSalzbergwerkAltaussee.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A tunnel in the [[Altaussee]] salt mine]]

===Altaussee salt mines===
Despite the fact that the original storage locations, which had no military purpose and were culturally important in any case, would have been extremely unlikely to have been the subject of an Allied air attack, in 1943 Hitler ordered that these collections be moved. Beginning in February 1944, the artworks were relocated to the 14th-century Steinberg salt mines above the village of [[Altaussee]], code-named "Dora",&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref name="intelligent-TV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="museum-security"/&gt; in which the holdings of various Viennese museums had earlier been transferred.&lt;ref name=edsel303&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 303-306&lt;/ref&gt;  The transfer of Hitler's Linz collection from the repositories to the salt mine took 13 months to complete, and utilized both tanks and oxen when the trucks could not navigate the steep, narrow and winding roads because of the winter weather. The final convoy of purloined art arrived at the mine in April 1945, just weeks before [[V-E Day]].&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;

The labyrinthine salt mine has a single entrance, and a small gasoline-powered narrow-gauge engine pulling a flat car was utilized to navigate to the various caverns created by centuries of salt mining.  Into these spaces, workmen built storage rooms which boasted wooden floors, racks specifically designed to hold the paintings and other artworks, up-to-date lighting, and dehumidification equipment.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;  Despite the fact that the salt was mined using pipes and sluices through which flowed gravity-fed water from the mountain, which carried dissolved salt 17 miles away to [[Bad Ischl]], where the water was evaporated, leaving behind the salt,&lt;ref name=edsel303 /&gt; the mine was not naturally humid, as the salt in the mine's walls absorbed excess moisture, keeping the chambers at a constant 65% humidity, while the temperature only varied from a low of 4 degrees Celsius (40 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 8 degrees Celsius (47 degrees in the summer).  Mining operations continued as the artwork was loaded into the mines, with the miners occasionally dragooned into helping to unload.&lt;ref name=edsel303 /&gt;

According to James S. Plaut, who from November 1944 to April 1946 was Director of the Art Looting Investigation Unit of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), the salt mines held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;6755 old master paintings, of which 5350 were destined for Linz, 230 drawings, 1039 prints, 95 tapestries, 68 sculptures, 43 cases of objects d'art, and innumerable pieces of furniture; in addition, 119 cases of books from Hitler's library in Berlin, and 237 cases of books for the Linz library.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''Monuments Men'' Edsel gives a slightly different list, which had been prepared by Karl Sieber, the art restorer, and Max Eder, an engineer at the mine, and subsequently given to MFAA officer George Stout:
*6577 paintings
*230 drawings or watercolors
*954 prints
*137 pieces sculpture
*129 pieces arms and armor
*79 baskets of objects
*484 cases objects thought to be archives
*78 pieces furniture
*122 tapestries
*181 cases books
*1200-1700 cases apparently books or similar
*283 cases contents completely unknown

[[File:Bruegger Madonna Altaussee.jpg|thumb|right|325px|[[Michaelangelo]]'s ''[[Madonna of Bruges]]'' being removed from the mine]]

The noted [[Ghent Altarpiece]] &amp;ndash; the stealing of which had caused Jacques Jaujard to protest vehemently and temporarily lose his job &amp;ndash; arrived in the salt mine from [[Neuschwanstein]] in the autumn of 1944, and [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Bruges Madonna]]'' in October of that year.&lt;ref name=edsel303 /&gt; Detailed records were kept at [[Dresden]] and moved to [[Schloss Weißenstein]] at the end of the war, where they were confiscated by the Russians, but these were primarily of the paintings stored in Munich in the ''Fuhrerbau''.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

Also in the Altausee repository was ''The Plague in Florence'' by [[Hans Makart]], a favorite of Hitler's  It had been given to him by Mussolini after Hitler had asked for it numerous times.&lt;ref name=fest /&gt;

In April 1945, Supreme Allied Commander [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] gave up [[Berlin]] as a "prestige objective" that would not be worth the troops killed in order to take it &amp;ndash; the death toll was estimated at 100,000 &amp;ndash; and ordered the Third and Seventh Armies to turn south, towards what the Allies feared might be an "[[Alpine Redoubt]]" from which Hitler or fanatical Nazis could operate a harassing [[Werwolf|guerilla campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Shirer|Shirer, William L.]] ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1960.  pp. 1105-06&lt;/ref&gt; The area was known to have hidden caches of arms and supplies, and intelligence reports had told of SS units moving from Berlin into that area. This new strategy meant that Neuschwanstein and Altausee would be overrun, and the "Monuments Men" would be able to verify and recover the important art repositories that their information said were located in those places.&lt;ref name=edsel303 /&gt;

===Attempted destruction of the Altaussee repository===

As the Allied troops approached the salt mines, [[August Eigruber]], the ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of Upper Austria, gave orders to blow it up and destroy the artwork using the eight crates of 500-kilogram bombs he had stored in the mine on 10 and 13 April 1945.&lt;ref name=edsel303 /&gt; Hitler, through Martin Bormann, countermanded this order, and [[Albert Speer]], the Minister of Armaments and War Production, had "clarified" Hitler's [[scorched earth]] "[[Nero Decree]]", but Eigruber felt he knew what Hitler's actual intent was. He ignored the pleas from the managers of the mine that it be saved as a vital resource &amp;ndash; in Heilbronn another salt mine which was used to store art had been ordered to be blown up, but the miners refused to do so, as the mine was vital to their lives and livelihoods.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009) pp. 318-21&lt;/ref&gt; After the ''Führer'''s suicide, Eigruber ignored the conflicting and confusing orders coming from Berlin and again ordered the destruction of the mine and all the artwork in it.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 324-15&lt;/ref&gt; The managers of the mine attempted to remove the crates of bombs, but were headed off by Eigruber's adjutant, who placed armed guards loyal to the Gauleiter at the entrance.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; The bombs were then wired for detonation by a demolition team.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009). p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

Eigruber fled with an elite SS bodyguard, fully expecting his order of destruction to be carried out. Nevertheless, this did not happen.  Instead, between 1 and 7 May 1945, before the arrival of U.S. Army troops on 8 May, the eight 500-kilogram bombs were removed from the mine, and the tunnels near the mine entrance were blown up, blocking the mine and protecting it from intrusion without doing damage to the irreplaceable and priceless art collection inside.&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p.374-75&lt;/ref&gt;

Who, exactly, was responsible for saving the artwork took many years to determine, and was finally unravelled in the 1980s by Austrian historian Ernst Kubin. The plan was devised by Dr. Emmerich Pöchmüller, the general director of the mine, Eberhard Mayerhoffer, the technical director, and Otto Högler, the mine's foreman. It was sanctioned by Ernst Kaltenbrunner, an SS officer of high rank in the [[Gestapo]] who had grown up in the area, and was later convicted of mass-murder and hanged.  The plan was carried out by the miners,&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; with the tacit approval of Eigruber's guards, several of whom had been persuaded by Karl Sieber, an art restorer who had worked on paintings stored in the mine, that destroying the artwork and the mine was not a good idea. The entire operation took three weeks to implement.  On 5 May the signal was given, and six tons of explosives with 386 detonators and 502 timing switches were activated, causing 66 blasts which closed off 137 tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 374-81&lt;/ref&gt;  The blockages took about a month to clear away totally, although a hole big enough for a man to sidle through was completed by the miners overnight after the Americans arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 382-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to geo-political considerations, U.S. forces were ordered to pull back from the territory which included Altaussee, as it had been determined that it would be part of the Russian zone of occupation.  Because of this, the paintings and artworks in the mine were removed and transferred elsewhere in about two weeks, rather than the year which had originally been planned.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 385-87&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the approximately 12,000 pieces of art in the mine were recovered.&lt;ref name=riches /&gt; The Altaussee trove included both works meant specifically for the ''Führermuseum'' and other looted artwork as well.  Other caches of art not intended for Linz were recovered in places throughout the Reich; there were over 1000 repositories in southern Germany alone,.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; although some of the artworks in them came from the collections of German museums &amp;ndash; these were eventually returned. Much of Göring's collection from his estate at [[Carinhall]] was discovered in a cave at [[Berchtesgaden]], where he had a summer home near Hitler's Berghof retreat,&lt;ref name=plaut /&gt; part of it was also left in his private train, which was found in Unterstein, and had been looted by the local residents.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

===Looting of the Munich repository===

Part of the collection designated for the Linz museum was stored in the air raid shelters of the Führer Building in Munich, part of the Nazi complex there.  The building was broken into by a mob before American troops arrived in the city, and most of the 723 paintings still there were looted, with others were taken by American soldiers.  Only 148 paintings were eventually recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (2002), pp. 215-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war==
[[File:München Museum für Abgüsse klassischer Bildwerke (Gebäudefassade) crop.jpg|thumb|left|255px|The first building of the "Central Collecting Point" in Munich, which later became the [[Museum für Abgüsse Klassischer Bildwerke|Museum of Casts of Classical Statues]]; it had been an administrative building for the Nazi Party. Later, other buildings in the complex were used when this building was full.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 391-92&lt;/ref&gt;]]

After the war, the American [[Nazi plunder#Art Looting Investigation Unit|Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU)]] of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) made thirteen detailed reports on the Linz museum and the Nazi plundering of art.&lt;ref name="petropoulos"&gt;{{Citation|first=Prof. Jonathan |last=Petropolous|title = Linz: Hitler's Museum and Library: Consolidated Interrogation Report No. 4, 15 December 1945, The Reports of the Office of Strategic Services Art Looting Investigation Unit |url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/pcha/linztable.html | accessdate=13 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These reports were synthesised into four consolidated reports; the fourth of these was written by S. Lane Faison covering the ''Führermuseum''.&lt;ref name="petropoulos"/&gt; These reports focused on returning art to rightful owners.  The authority for this was the 1943 Declaration of London, which invalidated all German art purchases in the occupied territories.

Most of the paintings and other artworks were brought to the "Central Collecting Point" in Munich, a former Nazi Party administrative building, where they were registered and rephotographed if necessary. Restitutions occurred as early as autumn 1945.  The work was turned over to German authorities in September 1949. In 1962, the responsible agency was disbanded, and the remaining unreturnable artworks were assessed for their value as museum items. These were loaned to various museums, while other pieces are on loan to government agencies.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

Jacques Jaujard, the French Director of National Museums, was hailed as a national hero following the war for his part in saving the French national art collection.  He was made a Commander of the [[Legion of Honor]] and given the [[Medal of Resistance]].  [[Rose Valland]], who surreptitiously collected information on the looted artwork that passed through the ''Jeu de Paume'' museum, became a fine arts officer with the French First Army and assisted the MFAA in the collection of looted artwork. She was inducted into the French Legion of Honor and also received the Medal of Resistance, was awarded the [[Medal of Freedom (1945)|Medal of Freedom]] from the U.S. and the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit]] from [[West Germany]].  In 1953, she finally received the coveted title of "curator". Count Franz von Wolff-Metternich, the "good German" arts officer who helped to protect the French national art collection from Nazi predation worked with the Allies after the war, return artworks to their rightful owners, then joined the West German Foreign Office, where he tracked looted art.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 410-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the men of the Altaussee salt mine who were responsible for saving the artwork stored there by preventing the mine from being blown up did not fare well in the postwar period.  All members of the Nazi Party, as were most professionals at that time in order to be allowed to work, they were all affected to one degree or another by the post-war [[denazification]] efforts.  None of them received during their lifetimes the credit that was due to them for their acts in saving a significant portion of the art which had been looted by the Nazis from the Occupied Territories.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 406-10&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eastern Europe]], Soviet premier [[Joseph Stalin]] tasked Mikhail Khrapchenko with taking many of the ''Führermuseum'' artworks to stock Soviet art galleries.&lt;ref name="intelligent-TV"/&gt; Khrapchenko said "it would now be possible to turn [[Moscow]]’s [[Pushkin Museum]] into one of the world’s great museums, like the [[British Museum]], the [[Louvre]], or the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]]."{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Stockpiled artwork was recovered by the Soviet "Trophy Brigades" from the two enormous flaktowers which had been built in Berlin to shelter people and supplies; many of the paintings in the Friedrichshain Flaktower were destroyed by fires.&lt;ref&gt;Edsel with Witter (2009), pp. 353-55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
In 1998, the Federal Republic of Germany and 43 other countries agreed to the "Washington Principles", which required them to closely inspect their art inventories to establish the provenance of works which had changed ownership between 1933 and 1945.  In particular, German, France, Austria and the Netherlands and other countries publicly disclosed what artworks from the ''Sonderauftrag Linz'' collection remained in their inventories. The work began in Germany in 2000, and artworks which are "shown by renewed research to involve a persecution-related deprivation of property during the National Socialist period are to be returned."&lt;ref name=history /&gt;  In his book ''Das Braune Haus der Kunst: Hitler und der "Sonderauftrag Linz"'' ("The Brown House of Art and the 'Sonderauftrag Linz'"), published in Germany in 2005, Hans Christian Löhr argued that 191 artworks were missing at that time, and that they may be hanging in museums or private collections.&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt;  This is discussed in the film documentary ''[[The Rape of Europa (book)|The Rape of Europa]]'' and in [[Noah Charney]]'s book ''The Ghent Altarpiece, Stealing the Mystic Lamb''.

As of 2010, a photo album that an American soldier took from the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]], Hitler's vacation home, which catalogued artwork Hitler desired for the museum, was to be returned to Germany. Of the photo albums created for Hitler, 39 of them were discovered by American armed forces at [[Neuschwanstein]], where they had been deposited for safekeeping in April 1945.  These were used as evidence in the [[Nuremberg trials]], and are now at the [[United States National Archives]], with two others donated by Robert Edsel in 2007 and c.2013.  Edsel is the author of the book ''The Monuments Men'' about the activities of the Allied [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] (MFAA), on which [[The Monuments Men|the film of the same name]] was loosely based, and also the founder of the Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art. He got the two albums from the heirs of an American soldier.  Nineteen other albums recovered from Berchtesgaden were in Germany on permanent loan from the [[German Federal Archives]] (''Bundesarchiv'') to the German Historical Museum as of 2010, and 11 albums are considered to be lost.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2009/dec/09/wwii-veteran-had-hitlers-art-book-on-bookshelf/ "WWII veteran had Hitler's art book on bookshelf"] ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' (December 9, 2009) Accessed: March 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2008/nr08-22.html "National Archives Announces Discovery of "Hitler Albums" Documenting Looted Art" (press release)] [[United States National Archives]] (November 1, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global cascades models''' are a class of models aiming to model large and rare cascades that are triggered by exogenous perturbations which are relatively small compared with the size of the system. The phenomenon occurs ubiquitously in various systems, like [[information cascade]]s in social systems, [[stock market crash]]es in economic systems, and [[cascading failure]] in physics infrastructure networks. The models capture some essential properties of such phenomenon.

==Model description==
To describe and understand global cascades, a network-based [[threshold model]] has been proposed by [[Duncan J. Watts]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="PNAS2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Watts | first1 = D. J. | title = A simple model of global cascades on random networks | doi = 10.1073/pnas.082090499 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 99 | issue = 9 | pages = 5766–5771| year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = 122850| bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.5766W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is motivated by considering a population of individuals who must make a decision between two alternatives, and their choices depend explicitly on other people's states or choices. The model assumes that an individual will adopt a new particular opinion (product or state) if a threshold fraction of his/her neighbors have adopted the new one, else he would keep his original state. To initiate the model, a new opinion will be randomly distributed among a small fraction of individuals in the network. If the fraction satisfies a particular condition, a large cascades can be triggered.(see Global Cascades Condition) A [[phase transition]] phenomenon has been observed: when the network of interpersonal influences is sparse, the size of the cascades exhibits a [[power law]] distribution, the most highly connected nodes are critical in triggering cascades, and if the network is relatively dense, the distribution shows a bimodal form, in which nodes with average degree show more importance by serving as triggers.

Several generalizations of the Watt's threshold model have been proposed and analyzed in the following years. For example, the original model has been combined with independent interaction models to provide a generalized model of social contagion,  which classifies the behavior of the system into three universal classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dodds | first1 = P. | last2 = Watts | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.218701 | title = Universal Behavior in a Generalized Model of Contagion | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 92 | issue = 21 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = cond-mat/0403699 |bibcode = 2004PhRvL..92u8701D }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been generalized on modular networks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gleeson|first1=James.P|title=Cascades on correlated and modular random networks|journal=Physical Review E | year= 2008 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.77.046117|volume=77|bibcode=2008PhRvE..77d6117G}}&lt;/ref&gt; degree-correlated networks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dodds|first1=Peter Sheridan|last2=Payne|first2=Joshua L.|title=Analysis of a threshold model of social contagion on degree-correlated networks|journal=Physical Review E | year= 2009 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.79.066115|volume=79|arxiv=0903.0597|bibcode=2009PhRvE..79f6115D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to networks with tunable clustering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackett|first1=Adam|last2=Melnik|first2=Sergey|last3=Gleeson|first3=James.P| title=Cascades on a class of clustered random networks|journal=Physical Review E | year= 2011 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.83.056107|volume=83|arxiv=1012.3651|bibcode=2011PhRvE..83e6107H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the initiators has also been studied recently, shows that different initiator would influence the size of the cascades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=P.|last2=Sreenivasan|first2=S.|last3=Szymanski|first3=B.K|last4=Korniss|first4=G.|title=Threshold-limited spreading in social networks with multiple initiators|journal=Scientific Reports |year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2008.01.015|volume=387|pages=2637–2652|bibcode=2008PhyA..387.2637K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global cascades condition== 
To derive the precise cascade condition in the original model, a [[generating function]] method could be applied.&lt;ref name="PNAS2002" /&gt; The generating function for vulnerable nodes in the network is:

:&lt;math&gt; G_0(x)= \sum_k \rho_k p_k x^k,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the probability a node has degree ''k'', and 
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_k =
\begin{cases}
1  &amp; k=0 \\
\int_0^{1/k}f(\chi) \, d\chi &amp; k&gt;0 \\
\end{cases} 
 &lt;/math&gt;
and ''f'' is the distribution of the threshold fraction of individuals. The average vulnerable cluster size can be derived as:

:&lt;math&gt; \langle n\rangle=G_0(1)+\frac{G_0'(1)^2}{z-G_0''(1)} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''z'' is the average degree of the network. The Global cascades occur when the average vulnerable cluster size &lt;''n''&gt; diverges&lt;ref name="PNAS2002" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
 G_0''(1)=\sum_k k(k-1) \rho_k p_k = z
&lt;/math&gt;

The equation could be interpreted as: When &lt;math&gt;G_0''(1)&lt;z&lt;/math&gt;, the clusters in the network is small and global cascades will not happen since the early adopters are isolated in the system, thus no enough momentum could be generated. When &lt;math&gt;G_0''(1)&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, the typical size of the vulnerable cluster is infinite, which implies presence of global cascades.

==Relations with other contagion models==
The Model considers a change of state of individuals in different systems which belongs to a larger class of contagion problems. However it differs with other models in several aspects: Compared with 1) [[epidemic model]]: where contagion events between individual pairs are independent, the effect a single infected node having on an individual depends on the individual's other neighbors in the proposed model.  Unlike 2) [[percolation]] or [[self-organized criticality]] models, the threshold is not expressed as the absolute number of "infected" neighbors around an individual, instead, a corresponding fraction of neighbors is selected. It is also different from 3) random-field [[ising model]] and majority [[voter model]], which are frequently analyzed on regular lattices, here, however the heterogeneity of the network plays a significant role.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20446">'''That's Greek to me''' or '''It's (all) Greek to me''' is an [[idiom]] in English, expressing that something is incomprehensible.

The idiom is typically used with respect to the foreign nature, however it may be considered an insult to some. Complexity or imprecision of [[Speech|verbal]] or [[Writing|written]] expression or [[diagram]], often containing excessive use of [[jargon]], [[dialect]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[symbols]], or diagrams. The metaphor makes reference to [[Greek language|Greek]] (either [[Ancient Greek|ancient]] or [[Modern Greek|modern]]), as an [[Archetype|archetypal]] foreign form of communication both written and spoken. Technically, the phrase is classified as a [[dead metaphor]], meaning that its components cannot be used separately, unlike for example the dormant metaphor "foot of the hill", which permits saying "that hill has a tree at its foot". 

==Origins==
It may have been a direct translation of a similar phrase in {{lang-la|"Graecum est; non legitur"}} ("it is Greek, [therefore] it cannot be read").  This phrase was increasingly used by monk scribes in the Middle Ages, as knowledge of the Greek alphabet and language was dwindling among those who were copying manuscripts in monastic libraries.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Recorded usage of the metaphor in English traces back to the [[early modern period]]. It appears in 1599 in Shakespeare's play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', as spoken by [[Servilius Casca]] to Cassius after a festival in which Caesar was offered a crown:
{{quote|text=
CASSIUS: Did Cicero say any thing?&lt;br/&gt;
CASCA: Ay, he spoke Greek.&lt;br/&gt;
CASSIUS: To what effect?&lt;br/&gt;
CASCA: Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face again: but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own part, '''it was Greek to me'''. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.
|source=[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[The Tragedy of Julius Caesar]]'' (1599)}}

Here, Casca's literal ignorance of Greek is the source of the phrase, using its common meaning to play on the uncertainty among the conspirators about [[Cicero]]'s attitude to Caesar's increasingly regal behaviour. Shakespeare was not the only author to use the expression.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

It was also used in 1603 by [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]] in his play ''[[Patient Grissel]]'':
{{quote|text=
FAR: Asking for a Greek poet, to him he fails. I’ll be sworn he knows not so much as one character of the tongue.&lt;br/&gt;
RIC: Why, then it’s Greek to him.|source={{cnq|date=February 2018}}}}

The expression is almost exclusively used with reference to the speaker (generally "Greek to me"); Dekker's "Greek to him" is rare.

==Variations==
Different languages have similar formulations. Many have picked the point of reference to be a foreign language with another [[alphabet]] or [[writing system]].

This is an example of the usage of [[demonym]]s in relation to the ability of a people to be understood, comparable to the development of the words ''[[barbarian]]'' (one who babbles), ''Nemec'' ([[Slavic language|Slavic]] for "the mute one" indicating [[Germans]]).

===In other languages===
In an article published by Arnold L. Rosenberg in the language journal ''[[Lingvisticae Investigationes|Lingvisticæ Investigationes]]'', he claimed that there was a popular "consensus" that [[Chinese language|Chinese]] was the "hardest" language, since various non-English languages most frequently used the Chinese language in their equivalent expression to the English idiom "it's all Greek to me".&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, A. (1979). Lingvisticæ Investigationes:III 3(2). 323-339&lt;/ref&gt; Also, David Moser of the University of Michigan Center for Chinese Studies made the same claim as Arnold L. Rosenberg.&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;Moser, D. Pīnyīn.Info. Why Chinese Is So Damn Hard. Retrieved Jun 4, 2011, http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/moser.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Helix of sustainability.png|left|thumb|The helix of sustainability - the [[Carbon cycle]] ideal for manufacture and use]][[File:Recycle001.svg|thumb|left|The international [[recycling symbol]] - not nature identical.]]

The '''helix of sustainability''' is a concept coined to help manufacturing industry move to more sustainable practices by mapping its models of raw material use and reuse onto those of nature.The environmental benefits of the use crop origin sustainable materials have been assumed to be self-evident, but as the debate on [[food vs fuel]] shows, the whole product life cycle must be examined in the light of social and environmental effects in addition to technical suitability and profitability. 

The helix of sustainability&lt;ref&gt;"Nature’s way – sustainable polymers and composites" K Kirwan, N Tucker, MR Johnson, Materials World, Vol. 11, No. 10, October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirwan, K., "Life’s Work", Engineering, Vol. 246, No.3, pp. 30-31, May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, N., Kirwan, K., Jacobs, D., Johnson, M., "Addressing the Polymer Waste Mountain – the helix of sustainability and the flowering cell phone", Third International Workshop on Green Composites, March 16–17, 2005, Shin-Daigaku Kaikan of the Imadegawa Campus, Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept created as a representation of the [[Systems thinking|total systems approach]] to gain full advantage from manufacturing with [[Sustainable|sustainable materials]], particularly [[biopolymers]] and [[biocomposite]]s. In 2004 the concept was presented by Professor John Wood, then Chair of the Materials Foresight Panel at a [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]] event hosted by the then Secretary of State for Industry ([[Jacqui Smith]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Opportunities in Horticulture: A Proposal for Academic Posts in WMG", WMG Report, David Mullins, 26 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year it was also used in the [[European Science Foundation]] exploratory workshop on environmentally friendly composites.&lt;ref&gt;"Environmentally Friendly European Composites Workshop", K Kirwan, N Tucker, M Johnson, C Halstead, D Jacobs, Report, European Science Foundation, April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

The advantages of working with crop origin raw materials are readily observed if the social and environmental impacts are considered as well as monetary cost (the [[Triple bottom line]]), and the helix of sustainability helps to demonstrate this. For the full potential of biopolymers to be realised it is essential that attention is paid to every aspect of the manufacturing process from design (how to cope with the incertainties in properties associated with crop origin materials?), manufacture (can existing technologies be used?), through to end-of-life (can the redundant article be fed back into the materials cycle?).    
The entire supply chain must be considered because decisions taken at the design stage have significant effects right through the life of an article. Low cost assembly techniques (e.g. snap-fits) may make dismantling or repair uneconomical. However, if say, an easy-to-dismantle car is built, will there be any effect on the ability of the vehicle to absorb energy in a crash? At an even more fundamental level, what will be the social and environmental of the change in crop growing patterns. This low environmental impact approach to manufacturing is seen as an extension of [[waste reduction]] techniques such as [[lean manufacturing]]. 

Conventional [[Recycling|cycles of use and reuse]] are circular. Consider the mechanical recovery of conventional [[polymers]]. A complex [[infrastructure]] is needed to recover the material at the end of an article's useful life. At the end of an article's life - say a [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] carbonated drink bottle, the article must be separated from the waste stream, either by the consumer who throws it away, or by manual labour at the rubbish dump. It must then be transported to some facility to be reprocessed (using more labour and energy) back into a raw material. The [[Plastics extrusion|heat and shear forces]] associated with the process of remanufacture tends to produce material with slightly degraded properties compared to the original material.

For sustainable material articles there is not such a great requirement for a dedicated recovery infrastructure. If a [[Litter|litter lout]] throws a crop origin [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] article on the ground, it will ultimately biodegrade into [[humus]], water, and non-fossil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If the article is placed into a [[compostable]] waste stream, the humus can then be used as fertiliser for the next generation of crops, there is also no requirement to sort  biopolymer articles as there is with fossil polymer recycling. Note difference between [[landfill]] and [[compost]] - the limited biological activity in landfill is slow, and mostly [[Wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] resulting in the production of [[methane]], whereas [[composting]] is a rapid [[Decomposition|aerobic]] process resulting in humus, water and non-fossil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The energy bill for breaking down biodegradables into the fundamental building block molecules, and then reassembling them into usable raw materials is large, but is  uses direct solar energy rather than metered electricity. There is also no loss of properties with successive journeys through the cycle.

In [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]], '''homotopy type theory''' ('''HoTT''' {{IPAc-en|h|ɒ|t}}) is the [[Reification (knowledge representation)|reification]] turning the judgement that two terms of a given type are equal in [[intensional type theory]] into an actual identity type. More broadly, homotopy type theory refers to various lines of development of [[intensional type theory]], based on the interpretation of types as objects to which the intuition of (abstract) [[homotopy theory]] applies.
		 	
This includes, among other lines of work, the construction of homotopical and [[Higher category theory|higher-categorical]] [[Model (mathematical logic)|models]] for such type theories; the use of type theory as a logic (or [[internal language]]) for abstract homotopy theory and [[higher category theory]]; the development of mathematics within a type-theoretic [[foundation of mathematics|foundation]] (including both previously existing mathematics and new mathematics that homotopical types make possible); and the [[Formal proof|formalization]] of each of these in computer [[proof assistant]]s.

There is a large overlap between the work referred to as homotopy type theory, and as the [[univalent foundations]] project.  Although neither is precisely delineated, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, the choice of usage also sometimes corresponds to differences in viewpoint and emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Shulman|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Shulman (mathematician) |eprint=1601.05035v3|title=Homotopy Type Theory: A synthetic approach to higher equalities |date=2016-01-27}}, footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, this article may not represent the views of all researchers in the fields equally. This kind of variability is unavoidable when a field is in rapid flux.

== History ==

===Prehistory: the groupoid model===
At one time the idea that types in [[Intuitionistic type theory#Extensional versus intensional|intensional type theory]] with their identity types could be regarded as groupoids was [[mathematical folklore]]. It was first made precise semantically in the 1998 paper of Martin Hofmann and [[Thomas Streicher]] called "The groupoid interpretation of type theory", in which they showed that intensional type theory had a model in the category of [[groupoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Martin |last1=Hofmann |last2=Streicher |first2=Thomas |author2-link=Thomas Streicher| chapter=The groupoid interpretation of type theory |mr=1686862 |editor1-first=Giovanni |editor1-last=Sambin |editor2-first=Jan M. |editor2-last=Smith |title=Twenty Five Years of Constructive Type Theory |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLnKggT_In4C&amp;pg=PA83 |date=1998 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-158903-4 |pages=83–111 |series=Oxford Logic Guides |volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first truly "[[Homotopical algebra|homotopical]]" model of type theory, albeit only "1-[[dimension]]al" (the traditional models in the [[category of sets]] being homotopically 0-dimensional).

Their paper also foreshadowed several later developments in homotopy type theory. For instance, they noted that the groupoid model satisfies a rule they called "universe extensionality", which is none other than the restriction to 1-types of the ''univalence axiom'' that [[Vladimir Voevodsky]] proposed ten years later. (The axiom for 1-types is notably simpler to formulate, however, since a [[Coherence condition|coherence]] notion of "equivalence" is not required.)  They also defined "categories with isomorphism as equality" and conjectured that in a model using higher-dimensional groupoids, for such categories one would have "equivalence is equality"; this was later proven by Benedikt Ahrens, Krzysztof Kapulkin, and [[Michael Shulman (mathematician)|Michael Shulman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Benedikt |last=Ahrens |first2=Krzysztof |last2=Kapulkin |first3=Michael |last3=Shulman |author3-link=Michael Shulman (mathematician)|title=Univalent categories and the Rezk completion |journal=Mathematical Structures in Computer Science |volume=25 |year=2015|issue= 5|pages= 1010–1039|arxiv=1303.0584 |doi=10.1017/S0960129514000486|mr=3340533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history: model categories and higher groupoids===
The first higher-dimensional models of intensional type theory were constructed by Steve Awodey and his student Michael Warren in 2005 using [[Model category|Quillen model categories]]. These results were first presented in public at the conference FMCS 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~robin/FMCS/FMCS_06/FMCS06.html Foundational Methods in Computer Science, University of Calgary, June 7th - 9th, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; at which Warren gave a talk titled "Homotopy models of intensional type theory", which also served as his thesis prospectus (the dissertation committee present were Awodey, Nicola Gambino and Alex Simpson). A summary is contained in Warren's thesis prospectus abstract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mawarren.net/papers/prospectus.pdf Michael Warren, "Homotopy Models of Intensional Type Theory"]&lt;/ref&gt;

At a subsequent workshop about identity types at [[Uppsala University]] in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.math.uu.se/~palmgren/itt/ Identity Types - Topological and Categorical Structure, Workshop, Uppsala, November 13-14, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  there were two talks about the relation between intensional type theory and factorization systems: one by Richard Garner, "Factorisation systems for type theory",&lt;ref&gt;[http://comp.mq.edu.au/~rgarner/Papers/Uppsala.pdf Richard Garner, Factorisation axioms for type theory]&lt;/ref&gt; and one by Michael Warren, "Model categories and intensional identity types". Related ideas were discussed in the talks by [[Steve Awodey]], "Type theory of higher-dimensional categories", and [[Thomas Streicher]], "Identity types vs. weak omega-groupoids: some ideas, some problems". At the same conference Benno van den Berg gave a talk titled "Types as weak omega-categories" where he outlined the ideas that later became the subject of a joint paper with Richard Garner.

All early constructions of higher dimensional models had to deal with the problem of coherence typical of models of dependent type theory, and various solutions were developed. One such was given in 2009 by Voevodsky, another in 2010 by van den Berg and Garner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |first=Benno van den |last=Berg |first2=Richard |last2=Garner |title=Topological and simplicial models of identity types |date=27 July 2010 |arxiv=1007.4638}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general solution, building on Voevodsky's construction, was eventually given by Lumsdaine and Warren in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter LeFanu |last=Lumsdaine |first2=Michael A. |last2=Warren |title=The local universes model: an overlooked coherence construction for dependent type theories |date=6 November 2014 |arxiv=1411.1736 |doi=10.1145/2754931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the PSSL86 in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/psslHomeEN.html 86th edition of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic, Henri Poincaré University, September 8-9 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  Awodey gave a talk titled "Homotopy type theory" (this was the first public usage of that term, which was coined by Awodey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/listPart.html Preliminary list of PSSL86 participants]&lt;/ref&gt;). Awodey and Warren summarized their results in the paper "Homotopy theoretic models of identity types", which was posted on the [[ArXiv]] preprint server in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Steve |last=Awodey |first2=Michael A. |last2=Warren |title=Homotopy theoretic models of identity types |date=3 September 2007 |publisher=Cornell University Library |arxiv=0709.0248 |doi=10.1017/S0305004108001783 |volume=146 |journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |page=45|bibcode=2008MPCPS.146...45A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and published in 2009; a more detailed version appeared in Warren's thesis "Homotopy theoretic aspects of constructive type theory" in 2008.

At about the same time, Vladimir Voevodsky was independently investigating type theory in the context of the search of a language for practical formalization of mathematics. In September 2006 he posted to the Types mailing list  "A very short note on homotopy [[lambda calculus]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/Voevodsky_note.ps ''A very short note on homotopy λ-calculus'', by Vladimir Voevodsky, September 27, 2006] PDF&lt;/ref&gt; which sketched the outlines of a type theory with dependent products, sums and universes and of a model of this type theory in Kan [[simplicial set]]s. It began by saying "The homotopy λ-calculus is a hypothetical (at the moment) type system" and ended with "At the moment much of what I said above is at the level of conjectures. Even the definition of the model of TS in the homotopy category is non-trivial" referring to the complex coherence issues that were not resolved until 2009. This note included a syntactic definition of "equality types" that were claimed to be interpreted in the model by path-spaces, but did not consider [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s rules for identity types. It also stratified the universes by homotopy dimension in addition to size, an idea that later was mostly discarded.

On the syntactic side, Benno van den Berg conjectured in 2006 that the tower of identity types of a type in intensional type theory should have the structure of an ω-category, and indeed a ω-groupoid, in the "globular, algebraic" sense of Michael Batanin. This was later proven independently by van den Berg and Garner in the paper "Types are weak omega-groupoids" (published 2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Benno |last=van den Berg |first2=Richard |last2=Garner |title=Types are weak omega-groupoids |date=1 December 2007 |publisher=Cornell University Library |arxiv=0812.0298 |doi=10.1112/plms/pdq026}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Peter Lumsdaine in the paper "Weak ω-Categories from Intensional Type Theory" (published 2009) and as part of his 2010 Ph.D. thesis "Higher Categories from Type Theories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Lumsdaine |title=Higher Categories from Type Theories |date=2010 |type=Ph.D. |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University |url=http://lib.rett.org.uk/~peterlefanulumsdaine/research/Lumsdaine-2010-Thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The univalence axiom, synthetic homotopy theory, and higher inductive types===
The concept of a univalent fibration was introduced by Voevodsky in early 2006&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/vladimirias/2006_Mar_Homotopy_lambda_calculus Notes on homotopy lambda calculus, March 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, because of the insistence of all presentations of the Martin-Löf type theory on the property that the identity types, in the empty context, may contain only reflexivity, Voevodsky did not recognize until 2009 that these identity types can be used in combination with the univalent universes. In particular, the idea that univalence can be introduced simply by adding an axiom to the existing Martin-Löf type theory appeared only in 2009.

Also in 2009, Voevodsky worked out more of the details of a model of type theory in [[Kan complex]]es, and observed that the existence of a universal [[Kan fibration]] could be used to resolve the coherence problems for categorical models of type theory. He also proved, using an idea of A. K. Bousfield,  that this universal fibration was univalent: the associated fibration of pairwise homotopy equivalences between the fibers is equivalent to the paths-space fibration of the base.

To formulate univalence as an axiom Voevodsky found a way  to define "equivalences" syntactically that had the important property that the type representing the statement "f is an equivalence" was (under the assumption of function extensionality) (-1)-truncated (i.e. contractible if inhabited). This enabled him to give a ''syntactic'' statement of univalence, generalizing Hofmann and Streicher's "universe extensionality" to higher dimensions. He was also able to use these definitions of equivalences and contractibility to start developing significant amounts of "synthetic homotopy theory" in the proof assistant [[Coq]]; this formed the basis of the library later called "Foundations" and eventually "UniMath".&lt;ref name=UniMath&gt;[https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath GitHub repository, Univalent Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unification of the various threads began in February 2010 with an informal meeting at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], where Voevodsky presented his model in Kan complexes and his Coq code to a group including Awodey, Warren, Lumsdaine, and [[Robert Harper (computer scientist)|Robert Harper]], Dan Licata, [[Michael Shulman (mathematician)|Michael Shulman]], and others. This meeting produced the outlines of a proof (by Warren, Lumsdaine, Licata, and Shulman) that every homotopy equivalence is an equivalence (in Voevodsky's good coherent sense), based on the idea from category theory of improving equivalences to adjoint equivalences. Soon afterwards, Voevodsky proved that the univalence axiom implies function extensionality.

The next pivotal event was a mini-workshop at the [[Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach]] in March 2011 organized by Steve Awodey, Richard Garner, Per Martin-Löf, and Vladimir Voevodsky, titled "The homotopy interpretation of constructive type theory".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hottheory.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/report-11_2011.pdf Mini-Workshop: ''The Homotopy Interpretation of Constructive Type Theory'', Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach, February 27th – March 5th, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a Coq tutorial for this workshop, Andrej Bauer wrote a small Coq library.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/andrejbauer/Homotopy GitHub repository, Andrej Bauer, Homotopy theory in Coq]&lt;/ref&gt; based on Voevodsky's ideas (but not actually using any of his code); this eventually became the kernel of the first version of the "HoTT" Coq library&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/commit/1fb4ed9e5cdc5494f26ae6d13c4ebc851b81e1ba GitHub Basic homotopy type theory, Andrej Bauer &amp; Vladimir Voevodsky, Apr 29, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; (the first commit of the latter&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT GitHub repository, Homotopy type theory]&lt;/ref&gt; by Michael Shulman notes "Development based on Andrej Bauer's files, with many ideas taken from Vladimir Voevodsky's files"). One of the most important things to come out of the Oberwolfach meeting was the basic idea of higher inductive types, due to Lumsdaine, Shulman, Bauer, and Warren. The participants also formulated a list of important open questions, such as whether the univalence axiom satisfies canonicity (still open, although some special cases have been resolved positively&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Shulman |title=Univalence for inverse diagrams and homotopy canonicity |date=15 March 2012 |publisher=Cornell University Library |arxiv=1203.3253 |doi=10.1017/S0960129514000565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~drl/pubs/lh112tt/lh112tt.pdf ''Canonicity for 2-Dimensional Type Theory'', by Daniel R. Licata and Robert Harper, Carnegie Mellon University, July 21, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;), whether the univalence axiom has nonstandard models (since answered positively by Shulman), and how to define (semi)simplicial types (still open in MLTT, although it can be done in Voevodsky's Homotopy Type System (HTS), a type theory with two equality types).

Soon after the Oberwolfach workshop, the ''Homotopy Type Theory website and blog''&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; was established, and the subject began to be popularized under that name. An idea of some of the important progress during this period can be obtained from the blog history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/blog Homotopy Type Theory blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Univalent foundations==
The phrase "univalent foundations" is agreed by all to be closely related to homotopy type theory, but not everyone uses it in the same way.  It was originally used by Vladimir Voevodsky to refer to his vision of a foundational system for mathematics in which the basic objects are homotopy types, based on a type theory satisfying the univalence axiom, and formalized in a computer proof assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/ Type Theory and Univalent Foundations]&lt;/ref&gt;

As Voevodsky's work became integrated with the community of other researchers working on homotopy type theory, "univalent foundations" was sometimes used interchangeably with "homotopy type theory",&lt;ref name=hott/&gt;  and other times to refer only to its use as a foundational system (excluding, for example, the study of model-categorical semantics or computational metatheory).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncatlab.org/homotopytypetheory/show/References Homotopy Type Theory: References]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the subject of the IAS special year was officially given as "univalent foundations", although a lot of the work done there focused on semantics and metatheory in addition to foundations.  The book produced by participants in the IAS program was titled "Homotopy type theory: Univalent foundations of mathematics"; although this could refer to either usage, since the book only discusses HoTT as a mathematical foundation.&lt;ref name=hott/&gt;

== Special Year on Univalent Foundations of Mathematics&lt;!--'HoTT Book' and 'HoTT book' redirect here--&gt; ==
[[File:The making of HoTT book.webm|thumb|An animation showing development of the HoTT Book on the GitHub repository by the participants in the Univalent Foundations Special Year project.]]
In 2012–13 researchers at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] held "A Special Year on Univalent Foundations of Mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.math.ias.edu/sp/univalent IAS school of mathematics:  Special Year on The Univalent Foundations of Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt;  The special year brought together researchers in [[topology]], [[computer science]], [[category theory]], and [[mathematical logic]]. The program was organized by [[Steve Awodey]],  [[Thierry Coquand]] and [[Vladimir Voevodsky]].

During the program  [[Peter Aczel]], who was one of the participants, initiated a working group which investigated how to do type theory informally but rigorously, in a style that is analogous to ordinary mathematicians doing set theory. After initial experiments it became clear that this was not only possible but highly beneficial, and that a book (the so-called '''HoTT Book''')&lt;ref name=hott&gt;{{cite book|author=Univalent Foundations Program|title=Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics|year=2013|publisher=Institute for Advanced Study|url=http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/2013/06/20/the-hott-book/ Official announcement of The HoTT Book, by Steve Awodey, 20 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; could and should be written. Many other participants of the project then joined the effort with technical support, writing, proof reading, and offering ideas. Unusually for a mathematics text, it was developed collaboratively and in the open on [[GitHub]], is released under a [[Creative Commons license]] that allows people to [[fork (software development)|fork]] their own version of the book, and is both purchasable in print and downloadable free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D |last=Monroe |title=A New Type of Mathematics? |journal=Comm ACM |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=13–15 |year=2014 |doi=10.1145/2557446 |url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2014/2/171675-a-new-type-of-mathematics/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/06/the_hott_book.html Announcement of The HoTT Book, by Mike Shulman at The n-Category Café, June 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.andrej.com/2013/06/20/the-hott-book/ Announcement of The HoTT Book, by Andrej Bauer, June 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the special year was a catalyst for the development of the entire subject; the HoTT Book was only one, albeit the most visible, result.

=== "Propositions as types" ===
HoTT uses a modified version of the "[[Propositions as types principle|propositions as types]]" interpretation of type theory, according to which types can also represent propositions and terms can then represent proofs.  In HoTT, however, unlike in standard "propositions as types", a special role is played by 'mere propositions' which, roughly speaking, are those types having at most one term, up to [[propositional equality]].  These are more like conventional logical propositions than are general types, in that they are proof-irrelevant.

=== Equality ===
The fundamental concept of homotopy type theory is the [[path (topology)|path]]. In HoTT, the type &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; is the type of all paths from the point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to the point &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. (Therefore, a proof that a point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; equals a point &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the same thing as a path from the point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to the point &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.) For any point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a path of type &lt;math&gt;a = a&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the reflexive property of equality. A path of type &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; can be inverted, forming a path of type &lt;math&gt;b = a&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the symmetric property of equality. Two paths of type &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; resp. &lt;math&gt;b = c&lt;/math&gt; can be concatenated, forming a path of type &lt;math&gt;a = c&lt;/math&gt;; this corresponds to the transitive property of equality.

Most importantly, given a path &lt;math&gt;p:a=b&lt;/math&gt;, and a proof of some property &lt;math&gt;P(a)&lt;/math&gt;, the proof can be "transported" along the path &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to yield a proof of the property &lt;math&gt;P(b)&lt;/math&gt;. (Equivalently stated, an object of type &lt;math&gt;P(a)&lt;/math&gt; can be turned into an object of type &lt;math&gt;P(b)&lt;/math&gt;.) This corresponds to the substitution property of equality. Here, an important difference between HoTT and classical mathematics comes in. In classical mathematics, once the equality of two values &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; has been established, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; may be used interchangeably thereafter, with no regard to any distinction between them. In homotopy type theory, however, there may be multiple different paths &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;, and transporting an object along two different paths will yield two different results. Therefore, in homotopy type theory, when applying the substitution property, it is necessary to state which path is being used.

In general, a "proposition" can have multiple different proofs. (For example, the type of all natural numbers, when considered as a proposition, has every natural number as a proof.) Even if a proposition has only one proof &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, the space of paths &lt;math&gt;a = a&lt;/math&gt; may be non-trivial in some way. A "mere proposition" is any type which either is empty, or contains only one point with a trivial [[Path space (algebraic topology)|path space]].

Note that people write &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;Id_A(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, 
thereby leaving the type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; implicit. 
Do not confuse it with &lt;math&gt;id_A : A\to A&lt;/math&gt;, denoting the identity function on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Type equivalence ===
Two types &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; belonging to some universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; are defined as being ''equivalent'' if there exists an ''equivalence'' between them. An equivalence is a function 
:&lt;math&gt;f:A \to B&lt;/math&gt;
which has both a left inverse and a right inverse, in the sense that for suitably chosen &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, the following types are both inhabited:
:&lt;math&gt;Id_{B\rightarrow B}(f \circ g, id_B),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Id_{A \rarr A}(h \circ f, id_A).&lt;/math&gt; 
i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;f \circ g =_{B\rightarrow B} id_B,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h \circ f =_{A\rightarrow A} id_A.&lt;/math&gt; 
This expresses a general notion of "f has both a left inverse and right inverse", using equality types. Note that the invertibility conditions above are equality types in the function types &lt;math&gt;A\rarr A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\rarr B&lt;/math&gt;.  One generally assumes the function extensionality axiom, which ensures that these are equivalent to the following types that express invertibility using the equality on the domain and codomain &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_{y:B}.\ Id_B((f \circ g)(y), id_B(y)),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_{x:A}.\ Id_A((h \circ f)(x), id_A(x)).&lt;/math&gt; 
i.e. for all &lt;math&gt;x:A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y:B&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;f(g(y)) =_B y,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h(f(x)) =_A x.&lt;/math&gt;

The functions of type
:&lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt;
together with a proof that they are equivalences are denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;A \simeq B&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The univalence axiom ===
Having defined functions that are equivalences as above, one can show that there is a canonical way to turn paths to equivalences.
In other words, there is a function of the type
:&lt;math&gt;(A = B) \to (A \simeq B),&lt;/math&gt;
which expresses that types &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; that are equal are, in particular, also equivalent.

The '''univalence axiom''' states that this function is itself an equivalence.&lt;ref name=hott /&gt;{{rp|115}}  Therefore, we have

: &lt;math&gt;(A = B) \simeq (A \simeq B)&lt;/math&gt;

"In other words, identity is equivalent to equivalence. In particular, one may say that 'equivalent
types are identical'."&lt;ref name=hott /&gt;{{rp|4}}

== Applications ==

=== Theorem proving ===
HoTT allows mathematical proofs to be translated into a [[computer programming language]] for computer [[proof assistant]]s much more easily than before. This approach offers the potential for computers to check difficult proofs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/09/new-foundation-mathematics?et_cid=4133336&amp;et_rid=677699018&amp;location=top|title = A new foundation for mathematics|date = 3 September 2014|accessdate = 6 September 2014|website = |publisher = R&amp;D Magazine|last = Meyer|first = Florian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One goal of mathematics is to formulate axioms from which virtually all mathematical theorems can be derived and proven unambiguously. Correct proofs in mathematics must follow the rules of logic. They must be derivable without error from [[axiom]]s and already-proven statements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

HoTT adds the univalence axiom, which relates the equality of logical-mathematical propositions to homotopy theory. An equation such as “a=b” is a mathematical proposition in which two different symbols have the same value. In homotopy type theory, this is taken to mean that the two shapes which represent the values of the symbols are topologically equivalent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These topological equivalence relationships, [[ETH Zürich]] Institute for Theoretical Studies director [[Giovanni Felder]] argues, can be better formulated in homotopy theory because it is more comprehensive: Homotopy theory explains not only why “a equals b” but also how to derive this. In set theory, this information would have to be defined additionally, which makes the translation of mathematical propositions into programming languages more difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Computer programming ===
{{section expand|date=December 2014}}
As of 2015, intense research work was underway to model and formally analyse the computational behavior of the univalence axiom in homotopy type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2676983|title = Higher Inductive Types as Homotopy-Initial Algebras|last = Sojakova|first = Kristina|date = 2015|conference = POPL 2015|doi = 10.1145/2676726.2676983|access-date = |arxiv = 1402.0761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cubical type theory'' is one attempt to give computational content to homotopy type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Cubical Type Theory: a constructive interpretation of the univalence axiom|url=https://hal-iogs.archives-ouvertes.fr/INRIA/hal-01378906v2|last1=Cohen|first1=Cyril|last2=Coquand|first2=Thierry|last3=Huber|first3=Simon|last4=Mörtberg |first4=Anders|conference=TYPES 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is believed that certain objects, such as semi-simplicial types, cannot be constructed without reference to some notion of exact equality. Therefore, various ''two-level type theories'' have been developed which partition their types into fibrant types, which respect paths, and non-fibrant types, which do not. Cartesian Cubical Computational Type Theory is the first two-level type theory which gives a full computational interpretation to homotopy type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Cartesian Cubical Computational Type Theory: Constructive Reasoning with Paths and Equalities| last1=Anguili|first1=Carlo|last2=Favonia|last3=Harper|first3=Robert|conference=Computer Science Logic 2018|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/papers/cartesian/paper.pdf|year=2018|accessdate=26 Aug 2018}} (to appear)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2408">'''Induced movement''' or '''induced motion''' is an [[illusion]] of [[visual perception]] in which a stationary or a moving object appears to move or to move differently because of other moving objects nearby in the [[visual field]].  It is interpreted in terms of the change in the location of an object due to the movement in the space around it. The object affected by the illusion is called the ''target'', and the other moving objects are called the ''background'' or the ''context'' (Duncker, 1929).

==Induced movement with stationary target==

A stationary object appears to move in the opposite direction to the background. For example, the moon on a cloudy, windy night appears to be racing through the sky opposite to the direction of the clouds, though the moon is essentially stationary in the sky and only appears to be moving due to the movement of the clouds. For an illustration, see http://psychlab1.hanover.edu/Classes/Sensation/induced/

==Induced movement with a moving target==

A moving object appears to be moving faster when it is moving in the opposite direction to the background; it appears to be moving slower when it is moving in the same direction as the background.&lt;ref&gt;For an illustration, see http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/psychologie/ae/Ae01/forschung/indumo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of induced movement==

Induced motion has more continuous history than does apparent motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wade|first=Nicholas J.|title=A Natural History of Vision|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=210–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Induced movement was reported by [[Ptolemy]] (ca. 90 – ca. 168 AD) (see Smith, 1996). It was researched extensively by Duncker (1929).

'''Jacek Tylicki''' (born 1951 in [[Sopot]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) is a Polish artist who settled in [[New York City]] in 1982. Tylicki works in the field of [[land art]], [[installation art]], and [[site-specific art]]. His [[Conceptual art|conceptual]] projects often raise social and environmental issues.

==Works==
Starting in 1973, Tylicki began sending sheets of canvas or paper into the [[wind]], [[river]]s, or [[forest]]s and leaving them for a long while in a natural environment, thus forcing upon nature an attitude previously reserved to the artist: the creation of forms. The project is often called ''natural art''.
 
In the years 1974–1990, he initiated the idea of an anonymous artist by issuing a periodical called ''Anonymous Artists'' where artists could present their art without revealing their own names.

In 1985 he created an [[Installation art|installation]] called ''Chicken Art''. Tylicki transformed the [[Now Gallery]] in [[Manhattan]] to a hen house in which live chickens watched realistic paintings of chickens, chicks and roosters hanging on the gallery walls. Tylicki declared:

Another installation was the ''Free Art'', where Tylicki invited well-known artists, including [[Mark Kostabi]] and [[Rodney Greenblat]], to give away their art to the public for free. [[Video art|Video]] and [[photography]] play an important role in his work as a record of its elusiveness and transience.

'''John chapter 18, verse 38''' of the [[Gospel of John]], is often referred to as "jesting [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]]" or "''What is truth?''", of [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Quid est veritas?'' In it, [[Pontius Pilate]] questions [[Jesus]]' claim that he is "witness to the truth" ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#18:37|John 18:37]]).&lt;ref name=W303 &gt;''The Wiersbe Bible Commentary: The Complete New Testament'' by Warren W. Wiersbe 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7814-4539-9}} page 303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Augustine &gt;''Ask Augustine'' by Paul A. Tambrino 2006 {{ISBN|1-59781-894-1}} pages 192-194&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this statement, Pilate proclaims to the masses (lit., "the Jews" referring to the Jewish authorities&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.org/netbible/joh18_notes.htm#18109 NET Bible notes on John 18:38] '''Textual note:''' Or “the Jewish authorities”; Grk “the Jews.” Here the phrase refers to the Jewish leaders, especially members of the Sanhedrin. See the note on the phrase “Jewish leaders” in v. 12. The term also occurs in v. 31, where it is clear the Jewish leaders are in view, because they state that they cannot legally carry out an execution. Although it is likely (in view of the synoptic parallels) that the crowd here in 18:38 was made up not just of the Jewish leaders, but of ordinary residents of Jerusalem and pilgrims who were in Jerusalem for the Passover, nevertheless in John’s Gospel Pilate is primarily in dialogue with the leadership of the nation, who are expressly mentioned in 18:35 and 19:6.&lt;/ref&gt;) that he does not consider Jesus guilty of any crime.

==Analysis==
[[File:P52 verso.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Rylands Library Papyrus P52|P52]], an ancient papyrus inscribed with John 18:37-38]]
[[File:What-is-truth02.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Nikolai Ge]] "[[Jesus|Christ]] and [[Pontius Pilate|Pilatus]]" (What is truth?), 1890.]]

The exact intention of Pilate has been subject to debate among scholars, with no firm conclusion.&lt;ref name=W303 /&gt; His statement may have been made in jest that the trial was a mockery, or he may have actually intended to reflect on the philosophical position that [[truth]] is hard to ascertain.&lt;ref name=W303 /&gt; The Greek word rendered as "truth" in English translations is "[[aletheia]]", which literally means "unconcealed" and connotes sincerity in addition to factuality and reality. 

This verse reflects the Christian tradition of the "guiltlessness of Jesus" in [[Pilate's Court]].&lt;ref name=Harrington488 &gt;''The Gospel of John'' by Francis J. Moloney, Daniel J. Harrington 1998 {{ISBN|0-8146-5806-7}} pages 488-489 &lt;/ref&gt; The innocence of Jesus is important in the Gospel of John, given that it emphasizes Jesus as the [[Lamb of God]].

Note that Jesus, although he does not respond to Pilate's question (perhaps because Pilate "went out again" before giving him a chance to) knows the answer. During his prayer in [[Gethsemane]], Jesus tells [[God the Father|God]], "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth." (John 17:17)

In addition to the guiltlessness of Jesus this verse also reflects the rejection of the truth of God: Jesus, the witness to truth was [[Rejection of Jesus|rejected]], ignored and condemned.&lt;ref name=Harrington488 /&gt;

==Literary references==
This verse has been widely quoted and alluded to in culture and literature, particularly in that of [[philosophy|philosophical]] nature. While Pilate's question -- whether intended philosophically, jestfully, rhetorically, or born of frustration at the lack of a plain answer -- is by no means the only incident of someone questioning the nature of truth, it has been drawn upon many times as a significant occurrence thereof. 

[[Francis Bacon]] uses this musing to open his essay ''Of Truth'', saying that Pilate "would not stay for an answer". He uses this to introduce his theme of truth as an affirmation of [[faith]].{{cn|date=November 2013}}

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote of the line and extended praise to Pilate:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Do I still have to add that in the entire New Testament there is only ''one'' solitary figure one is obliged to respect? Pilate, the Roman governor.  To take a Jewish affair ''seriously'' - he cannot persuade himself to do that.  One Jew more or less - what does it matter ?... The noble scorn of a Roman before whom an impudent misuse of the word 'truth' was carried on has  enriched the New Testament with the only expression ''which'' ''possesses'' ''value'' - which is its criticism, its ''annihilation'' even: 'What is truth?..." (Nietzsche, writing in ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', §46)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Mikhail Bulgakov]] fictionally expands on the relationship between Pilate and Jesus in his novel ''[[Master and Margarita]]''. Specific reference to John 18:38 comes in Chapter 2 of the novel entitled "Pontius Pilate", in which he asks the very question "What is truth?" to Jesus ("Jeshua Ha-Notsri" - "Jesus of Nazareth" in Hebrew).

[[J. L. Austin]], the ordinary-language philosopher, in a symposium on truth, comments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'What is truth?' said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer. Pilate was in advance of his time. For 'truth' itself is an abstract noun, a camel, that is, of a logical construction, which cannot get past the eye even of a grammarian. We approach it cap and categories in hand : we ask ourselves whether Truth is a substance (the Truth, the Body of Knowledge), or a quality (something like the colour red, inhering in truths), or a relation ('correspondence'). But philosophers should take something more nearly their own size to strain at. What needs discussing rather is the use, or certain uses, of the word 'true.' In vino, possibly, 'veritas,' but in a sober symposium
'verum.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Austin|first1=John Langshaw|title=Truth|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|date=1950|volume=Supplementary Volume XXIV|url=http://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/pdf/austin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his novella (and play) ''Home Truths'', David Lodge lets the writer Adrian Ludlow quote "What is truth? said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer" when he is interviewed by the journalist Fanny Tarrant, known for her vicious and perhaps not entirely truthful interviews.

{{Nihongo|'''Keiko Holmes'''|恵子・ホームズ}} is a Japanese coordinator for a charity named [[Agape]], which helps to promote reconciliation between Japan and her former [[World War II]] [[prisoners of war]] (POWs). She lectures at universities and schools, and was awarded the [[O.B.E]].

==Early life==
Keiko was born in Kiwa-cho, [[Kumano, Mie|Kumano]], [[Mie Prefecture]], Japan in 1948. She travelled to Tokyo to study, and there met Paul Holmes, a visiting business man from England. They married and then moved to London with their sons Daniel and Christopher in 1979.

Paul was killed in an air accident in 1984 while on a business trip. They had been together for 15 years. Through Paul, Keiko had converted to [[Christianity]]. During their time in Japan, while living in Mie the couple had come across a memorial stone laid for 16 British army soldiers. The soldiers had died in the local area called Iruka, now called Kiwa-cho, while working as prisoners in a copper mine. The local people had created the memorial and had written the names of the soldiers on the memorial.
The Ikura mine was different from many others because the British soldiers worked side by side with Japanese miners.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Little Britain: Katasumi Ni Saku Chiisana Eikoku ; Zen Eikei Kyokutō Horyo, Keiki Hōmusu Kyōcho|author=Holmes, K.|date=1991|publisher=K. Holmes (35 Leyburn Gardens, Croydon CR0 5NL)|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pirnMgEACAAJ|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Keiko returned to Mie for a trip after Paul's death, she went back to the memorial site and was surprised to see that it had been improved into a memorial garden with a marble headstone and kept beautifully decorated with flowers. The soldiers' names had been engraved on a large copper cross.

Holmes had the inspiration to organise reconciliation trips for ex-POWs of Ikura during her long period of mourning for her husband.

In 1991, Holmes attended the annual conference of the British Far East Prisoners of War Association in [[London]].

In October 1992, Holmes took 26 FEPOWs and two widows back to attend a memorial service at the Iruka (now called Itaya) memorial. These men and woman had for 50 years held hatred and bitterness for Japan and its people. Upon arrive at the memorial and witnessing the beauty of the memorial donated by the local people and receiving their sincere apologies the 50 years of hate gave way to new positive feelings and healing.

==Career==
Since the first pilgrimage, Holmes has gone on to organise more trips and eventually founded “Agape”, in 1996. The name is taken from an ancient Greek word meaning, unconditional love. Supported by many people in Britain and Japan, as well as by donations from Japanese firms, including Sumitomo Corp. The Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi and many others. Agape now brings small veteran groups from Britain, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to Japan twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0972653562&lt;/ref&gt; On the trips, the [[FEPOW]]s come face to face with their old guards. Former soldiers, camp and prison guards often attend the Agape memorial service and meetings. Hiroshi Abe was a young officer in a railway regiment during the war assigned to the infamous Thai-[[Burma]] railway known to FEPOWs as the “Death Railway”. He attends the memorial every year to meet the soldiers. Abe's apology is printed in the Agape pamphlet:

"I cannot deny that l am partly responsible for the deaths of many POW’s, and l apologise sincerely for what we did during the war."

After many uphill struggles since the first pilgrimage to Japan in 1992. Agape has taken hundreds of FEPOWs to Japan's former war camp sites. Many FEPOWs express how their hated towards Japan has changed into love for the Japanese people. Holmes was awarded the O.B.E by Queen Elizabeth II at [[Windsor Castle]] on 28 April 1998. She attended the ceremony with her sons Daniel and Christopher.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0803977565&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2003, Holmes met the Emperor and Empress of Japan in [[Buckingham Palace]], England.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 2004 Holmes, Kosuge and some other members of Agape including Holmes' son Daniel Holmes went to Nanjing, China to apologise for the crimes committed and pain inflicted by her country men during the war. Holmes also has visited Malaysia, the Netherlands, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, United States, Canada and India holding meetings and lecturing at universities.

== History ==
ICJ Kenya was founded in 1959 and registered as a society in Kenya in 1974.  It has been involved in the move for constitutional change since the early 1990s. In 1994, together with the [[Law Society of Kenya]] (LSK) and the [[Kenya Human Rights Commission]] (KHRC), it drafted a model constitution for Kenya, which added to the pressure on the government of [[Daniel arap Moi]] to enact a new Constitution.&lt;ref name=successstories&gt;[http://www.icj-kenya.org/index.php/about-us/success-stories/242-achievements#sthash.fo4RRTdv.dpuf "Success stories"], ICJ Kenya&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, ICJ Kenya published a report on ‘The State of Freedom of Information in Kenya’, followed by a campaign for a Freedom of Information Bill.&lt;ref name=successstories /&gt; Long-term campaigning for reform of the Kenyan [[judiciary]] resulted in 2003 in the resignation of many judges and magistrates suspected of corruption and incompetence.&lt;ref name=successstories /&gt; Commentators state that the organisation has "influenced judicial reform"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tatic|first1=Sanja|last2=Walker|first2=Christopher|title=Countries at the Crossroads: A Survey of Democratic Governance|date=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780742558014|page=263|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ebjEVjJ-DcAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describe it as a "key knowledge repository" on the subject of judicial integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Transparency International|title=Global Corruption Report 2007: Corruption in Judicial Systems|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139465441|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A8S6Yd047LcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the organisation sought an arrest warrant for the president of [[Sudan]], [[Omar al-Bashir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ICJ seeks orders to arrest Bashir|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/news/ICJ-seeks-orders-to-arrest-Bashir/-/1056/1034248/-/cfe1b6z/-/index.html|work=The [[Daily Nation]] (Nairobi)|date=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrest warrant was issued by the Kenyan High Court in November 2011 and led to a breakdown of diplomatic relations between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-273588652.html "Kenya-Sudan relations veering towards a breakdown after court decision on Bashir's arrest"], [[Sudan Tribune]].

In partnership with other civil society groups in the region, ICJ Kenya published a report on "Counterterrorism and Human Rights Abuses in Kenya and Uganda: The World Cup Bombing and Beyond" (2012) on the response to the [[July 2010 Kampala attacks|2010 bombings in Kampala]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-309998679.html "New Report Documents Counterterrorism and Human Rights Abuses in Kenya and Uganda"], States News Service. 27 November 2012. Retrieved August 04, 2015 from HighBeam Research.&lt;/ref&gt; and instigated a court action against the Kenyan government in 2013 on behalf of victims of sexual violence following the [[Kenyan general election, 2007|2007 general elections]], alleging failure to protect them or investigate the crimes committed against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-320052808.html "Post-Election Rape Survivors Sue Kenyan Government"], IRIN Africa English Service.

'''Lean manufacturing''' or '''lean production''', often simply "'''lean'''", is a systematic method for waste minimization ("[[Muda (Japanese term)|Muda]]") within a manufacturing system without sacrificing productivity, which can cause problems.  Lean also takes into account waste created through overburden ("[[Muri (Japanese term)|Muri]]") and waste created through unevenness in work loads ("[[Mura (Japanese term)|Mura]]"). Working from the perspective of the client who consumes a product or service, "value" is any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for.

Lean manufacturing makes obvious what adds value, by reducing everything else (which is not adding value). This management philosophy is derived mostly from the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS) and identified as "lean" only in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="womack"&gt;{{cite book |last=Womack |first=James P. |authorlink=James P. Womack |author2=Daniel T. Jones |author3=Daniel Roos |title=[[The Machine That Changed the World (book)|The Machine That Changed the World]] |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Holweg 2007 420–437"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holweg |first=Matthias |title=The genealogy of lean production |journal=Journal of Operations Management |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=420–437 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.jom.2006.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; TPS is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original Toyota ''seven wastes'' to improve overall customer value, but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved. The steady growth of [[Toyota]], from a small company to the world's largest automaker,&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news| title=Automotive News calls Toyota world No 1 car maker| last=Bailey| first=David| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSN2424076820080124| agency=[[Reuters]]| work=Reuters.com| accessdate=19 April 2008| date=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; has focused attention on how it has achieved this success.

==Overview==
Lean principles are derived from the Japanese manufacturing industry. The term was first coined by John Krafcik in his 1988 article, "Triumph of the Lean Production System", based on his master's thesis at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Krafcik |first=John F. |title= Triumph of the lean production system |journal=Sloan Management Review |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=41–52 |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krafcik had been a quality engineer in the Toyota-GM [[NUMMI]] joint venture in California before joining MIT for MBA studies. Krafcik's research was continued by the [[International Motor Vehicle Program]] (IMVP) at MIT, which produced the international best-selling book co-authored by [[James P. Womack]], Daniel Jones, and [[Daniel Roos]] called ''[[The Machine That Changed the World (book)|The Machine That Changed the World]].''&lt;ref name="womack" /&gt; A complete historical account of the IMVP and how the term "lean" was coined is given by Holweg (2007).&lt;ref name="Holweg 2007 420–437"/&gt;

For many, lean is '''the set of "tools" that assist in the identification and steady elimination of waste'''. As waste is eliminated quality improves while production time and cost are reduced.
A non exhaustive list of such tools would include: [[Single-Minute Exchange of Die|SMED]], [[value stream mapping]], [[5S (methodology)|Five S]], ''[[Kanban]]'' (pull systems), ''[[poka-yoke]]'' (error-proofing), [[total productive maintenance]], elimination of time batching, mixed model processing, [[Production flow analysis|rank order clustering]], single point [[scheduling (production processes)|scheduling]], redesigning working cells, multi-process handling and [[control charts]] (for checking mura).

There is a second approach to lean manufacturing, which is promoted by Toyota, called [[The Toyota Way]], in which the focus is upon improving the "flow" or smoothness of work, thereby steadily eliminating ''mura'' ("unevenness") through the system and not upon 'waste reduction' per se. Techniques to improve flow include [[production leveling]], "pull" production (by means of ''kanban'') and the ''[[Heijunka box]]''. This is a fundamentally different approach from most improvement methodologies, and requires considerably more persistence than basic application of the tools, which may partially account for its lack of popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Liker, Jeffrey K. and Michael Hoseus (2008) Toyota Culture: The Heart and Soul of The Toyota Way, McGraw-Hill, New York p. 3-5 {{ISBN|978-0-07-149217-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between these two approaches is not the goal itself, but rather the prime approach to achieving it. The implementation of smooth flow exposes quality problems that already existed, and thus waste reduction naturally happens as a consequence. The advantage claimed for this approach is that it naturally takes a system-wide perspective, whereas a waste focus sometimes wrongly assumes this perspective.

Both lean and TPS can be seen as a loosely connected set of potentially competing principles whose goal is cost reduction by the elimination of waste.{{sfn|Ohno|1988|p=8}}{{fv|reason=The source doesn't even talk about 'lean' or any 'competition between the principles'|date=June 2018}} These principles include: pull processing, perfect first-time quality, waste minimization, continuous improvement, flexibility, building and maintaining a long term relationship with suppliers, [[autonomation]], load leveling and production flow and visual control. The disconnected nature of some of these principles perhaps springs from the fact that the TPS has grown pragmatically since 1948 as it responded to the problems it saw within its own production facilities. Thus what one sees today is the result of a 'need' driven learning to improve where each step has built on previous ideas and not something based upon a theoretical framework.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Toyota's view is that the main method of lean is not the tools, but the reduction of three types of waste: ''muda'' (non-value-adding work), ''muri'' (overburden), and ''mura'' (unevenness), to expose problems systematically and to use the tools where the ideal cannot be achieved. From this perspective, the tools are [[workaround]]s adapted to different situations, which explains any apparent incoherence of the principles above.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Lean implementation emphasizes the importance of optimizing work flow through strategic operational procedures while minimizing waste and being adaptable. Flexibility is required to allow production leveling ([[Heijunka]]) using tools such as SMED, but have their analogues in other processes such as [[research and development]] (R&amp;D). However, adaptability is often constrained, and therefore may not require significant investment. More importantly, all of these concepts have to be acknowledged by employees who develop the products and initiate processes that deliver value. The cultural and managerial aspects of lean are arguably more important than the actual tools or methodologies of production itself. There are many examples of lean tool implementation without sustained benefit, and these are often blamed on weak understanding of lean throughout the whole organization.

Lean aims to enhance productivity by simplifying the operational structure enough to understand, perform and manage the work environment. To achieve these three goals simultaneously, one of Toyota's mentoring methodologies (loosely called ''[[Senpai]]'' and ''[[Kohai]]'' which is Japanese for senior and junior), can be used to foster lean thinking throughout the organizational structure from the ground up. The closest equivalent to Toyota's mentoring process is the concept of "''[[Lean Sensei]]''," which encourages companies, organizations, and teams to seek third-party experts that can provide advice and coaching.&lt;ref name="Womack &amp; Jones 2003" /&gt;

In 1999, Spear and Bowen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first2 = H. Kent | last2 = Bowen | first1 = Steven | last1 = Spear |date=September 1999 | title = Decoding the DNA of the Toyota Production System | journal = Harvard Business Review | url = http://hbr.org/1999/09/decoding-the-dna-of-the-toyota-production-system/ar/1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified four rules which characterize the "Toyota DNA":

# All work shall be highly specified as to content, sequence, timing, and outcome.
# Every customer-supplier connection must be direct, and there must be an unambiguous yes or no way to send requests and receive responses.
# The pathway for every product and service must be simple and direct.
# Any improvement must be made in accordance with the [[scientific method]], under the guidance of a teacher, at the lowest possible level in the organization.

===Pre-20th century===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
[[Image:Benjamin Franklin.PNG|thumb|right|100x126px|Benjamin Franklin]]

Most of the basic goals of lean manufacturing and waste reduction were derived from [[Benjamin Franklin]] through documented examples. ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' says of wasted time, "He that idly loses 5[[shilling|s.]] worth of time, loses 5s., and might as prudently throw 5s. into the river." He added that avoiding unnecessary costs could be more profitable than increasing sales: "A penny saved is two pence clear. A pin a-day is a [[groat (coin)|groat]] a-year. Save and have."

Again Franklin's ''[[The Way to Wealth]]'' says the following about carrying unnecessary inventory. "You call them goods; but, if you do not take care, they will prove evils to some of you. You expect they will be sold cheap, and, perhaps, they may [be bought] for less than they cost; but, if you have no occasion for them, they must be dear to you. Remember what Poor Richard says, 'Buy what thou hast no need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries.' In another place, he says, 'Many have been ruined by buying good penny worths'." [[Henry Ford]] cited Franklin as a major influence on his own business practices, which included [[Just In Time (business)|Just-in-time]] manufacturing.

The accumulation of waste and energy within the work environment was noticed by motion efficiency expert [[Frank Gilbreth]], who witnessed the inefficient practices of masons who often bend over to gather bricks from the ground. The introduction of a non-stooping scaffold, which delivered the bricks at waist level, allowed masons to work about three times as quickly, and with the least amount of effort.

===20th century===
[[File:Frederick Winslow Taylor.JPG|thumb|right|113x228px|Frederick Winslow Taylor]]

[[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], the father of [[scientific management]], introduced what are now called standardization and best practice deployment. In ''[[Principles of Scientific Management]]'', (1911), Taylor said: "And whenever a workman proposes an improvement, it should be the policy of the management to make a careful analysis of the new method, and if necessary conduct a series of experiments to determine accurately the relative merit of the new suggestion and of the old standard. And whenever the new method is found to be markedly superior to the old, it should be adopted as the standard for the whole establishment."

Taylor also warned explicitly against cutting piece rates (or, by implication, cutting wages or discharging workers) when efficiency improvements reduce the need for raw labor: "...after a workman has had the price per piece of the work he is doing lowered two or three times as a result of his having worked harder and increased his output, he is likely entirely to lose sight of his employer's side of the case and become imbued with a grim determination to have no more cuts if soldiering [marking time, just doing what he is told] can prevent it."

[[Shigeo Shingo]], the best-known exponent of single minute exchange of die and error-proofing or poka-yoke, cites ''Principles of Scientific Management'' as his inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shingo|first1=Shigeo|title=The Sayings of Shigeo Shingo: Key Strategies for Plant Improvement|date=1987|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781563273841}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=June 2017}}

American industrialists recognized the threat of cheap offshore labor to American workers during the 1910s, and explicitly stated the goal of what is now called lean manufacturing as a countermeasure. Henry Towne, past President of the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]], wrote in the Foreword to Frederick Winslow Taylor's ''Shop Management'' (1911), "We are justly proud of the high wage rates which prevail throughout our country, and jealous of any interference with them by the products of the cheaper labor of other countries. To maintain this condition, to strengthen our control of home markets, and, above all, to broaden our opportunities in foreign markets where we must compete with the products of other industrial nations, we should welcome and encourage every influence tending to increase the efficiency of our productive processes."{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Henry Ford===
[[File:Timehenryford-crop.jpg|thumb|right|181x240px|Henry Ford]]

Henry Ford initially ignored the impact of waste accumulation while developing his mass assembly manufacturing system. Charles Buxton Going wrote in 1915:
:Ford's success has startled the country, almost the world, financially, industrially, mechanically. It exhibits in higher degree than most persons would have thought possible the seemingly contradictory requirements of true efficiency, which are: constant increase of quality, great increase of pay to the workers, repeated reduction in cost to the consumer. And with these appears, as at once cause and effect, an absolutely incredible enlargement of output reaching something like one hundredfold in less than ten years, and an enormous profit to the manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;([[Charles Buxton Going]], preface to [[Horace Lucian Arnold|Arnold]] and Faurote, ''Ford Methods and the Ford Shops'' (1915))&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford, in ''My Life and Work'' (1922),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ford | first = Henry; with Crowther, Samuel | authorlink = Henry Ford | year = 1922 | title = My Life and Work | publisher = Garden City Publishing Company, Inc | location = Garden City, New York City | url = http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/7213 }} Various republications, including {{ISBN|978-1-4065-0018-9}}. Original is public domain in U.S.&lt;/ref&gt; provided a single-paragraph description that encompasses the entire concept of waste:

:I believe that the average farmer puts to a really useful purpose only about 5% of the energy he expends.... Not only is everything done by hand, but seldom is a thought given to a logical arrangement. A farmer doing his chores will walk up and down a rickety ladder a dozen times. He will carry water for years instead of putting in a few lengths of pipe. His whole idea, when there is extra work to do, is to hire extra men. He thinks of putting money into improvements as an expense.... It is waste motion— waste effort— that makes farm prices high and profits low.

Poor arrangement of the workplace—a major focus of the modern kaizen—and doing a job inefficiently out of habit—are major forms of waste even in modern workplaces.

Ford also pointed out how easy it was to overlook material waste. A former employee, Harry Bennett, wrote:

:One day when Mr. Ford and I were together he spotted some rust in the slag that ballasted the right of way of the D. T. &amp; I [railroad]. This slag had been dumped there from our own furnaces. 'You know,' Mr. Ford said to me, 'there's iron in that slag. You make the crane crews who put it out there sort it over, and take it back to the plant.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bennett | first = Harry; with Marcus, Paul | authorlink = Harry Bennett | year = 1951 | title = We Never Called Him Henry | publisher =  Fawcett Publications | location = New York | lccn = 51036122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, Ford saw the rust and realized that the steel plant was not recovering all of the iron.

[[File:Ford assembly line - 1913.jpg|thumb|left|"Workers on the first moving assembly line put together magnetos and flywheels for 1913 Ford autos" Highland Park, Michigan]]
Ford's early success, however, was not sustainable. As James P. Womack and Daniel Jones pointed out in "Lean Thinking", what Ford accomplished represented the "special case" rather than a robust lean solution.&lt;ref name="Womack &amp; Jones 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Womack|first1=James, P.|last2=Jones,|first2=Daniel, T.|title=Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth in Your Corporation|date=2003|publisher=First Free Press|isbn=0-7432-4927-5|url=https://books.google.fi/books?id=QZrZAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Womack%20Jones%20Lean%20Thinking%3A%20Banish%20Waste%20and%20Create%20Wealth%20in%20Your%20Corporation&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}} The major challenge that Ford faced was that his methods were built for a steady-state environment, rather than for the dynamic conditions firms increasingly face today.&lt;ref name="ruffa"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruffa |first=Stephen A. |title=Going Lean: How the Best Companies Apply Lean Manufacturing Principles to Shatter Uncertainty, Drive Innovation, and Maximize Profits |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Q7OGDd61hkC |publisher=AMACOM |isbn=0-8144-1057-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his rigid, top-down controls made it possible to hold variation in work activities down to very low levels, his approach did not respond well to uncertain, dynamic business conditions; they responded particularly badly to the need for new product innovation. This was made clear by Ford's precipitous decline when the company was forced to finally introduce a follow-on to the Model T.

[[Design for Manufacture]] (DFM) is a concept derived from Ford which emphasizes the importance of standardizing individual parts as well as eliminating redundant components in ''My Life and Work''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} This [[standardization]] was central to Ford's concept of mass production, and the manufacturing "[[tolerances]]", or upper and lower dimensional limits that ensured [[interchangeable parts|interchangeability of parts]] became widely applied across manufacturing.  Decades later, the renowned Japanese quality guru, [[Genichi Taguchi]], demonstrated that this "goal post" method of measuring was inadequate.  He showed that "loss" in capabilities did not begin only after exceeding these tolerances, but increased as described by the [[Taguchi Loss Function]] at any condition exceeding the nominal condition.  This became an important part of [[W. Edwards Deming]]'s quality movement of the 1980s, later helping to develop improved understanding of key areas of focus such as [[cycle time variation]] in improving manufacturing quality and efficiencies in aerospace and other industries.

While Ford is renowned for his production line, it is often not recognized how much effort he put into removing the fitters' work to make the production line possible. Previous to the use, Ford's car's components were fitted and reshaped by a skilled engineer at the point of use, so that they would connect properly. By enforcing very strict specification and quality criteria on component manufacture, he eliminated this work almost entirely, reducing manufacturing effort by between 60-90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hounshell1984}} pp 248 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Ford's mass production system failed to incorporate the notion of "pull production" and thus often suffered from overproduction.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Toyota develops TPS===


Toyota's development of ideas that later became lean may have started at the turn of the 20th century with [[Sakichi Toyoda]], in a textile factory with [[loom]]s that stopped themselves when a thread broke. This became the seed of autonomation and ''[[Jidoka]]''. Toyota's journey with just-in-time (JIT) may have started back in 1934 when it moved from textiles to produce its first car. [[Kiichiro Toyoda]], founder of Toyota Motor Corporation, directed the engine casting work and discovered many problems in their manufacturing. He decided he must stop the repairing of poor quality by intense study of each stage of the process. In 1936, when Toyota won its first truck contract with the Japanese government, his processes hit new problems and he developed the "[[Kaizen]]" improvement teams.

Levels of demand in the Post War economy of Japan were low and the focus of mass production on lowest cost per item via economies of scale therefore had little application. Having visited and seen supermarkets in the USA, Taiichi Ohno recognised the scheduling of work should not be driven by sales or production targets but by actual sales. Given the financial situation during this period, over-production had to be avoided and thus the notion of Pull (build to order rather than target driven Push) came to underpin production scheduling.

It was with [[Taiichi Ohno]] at Toyota that these themes came together. He built on the already existing internal schools of thought and spread their breadth and use into what has now become the Toyota Production System (TPS). It is principally from the TPS (which was widely referred to in the 1980s as ''just-in-time manufacturing''), but now including many other sources, that lean production is developing. [[Norman Bodek]] wrote the following in his foreword to a reprint of Ford's ''Today and Tomorrow:''{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

{{quote|I was first introduced to the concepts of just-in-time (JIT) and the Toyota production system in 1980. Subsequently I had the opportunity to witness its actual application at Toyota on one of our numerous Japanese study missions. There I met Mr. Taiichi Ohno, the system's creator. When bombarded with questions from our group on what inspired his thinking, he just laughed and said he learned it all from Henry Ford's book." The scale, rigor and continuous learning aspects of TPS have made it a core concept of lean.}}

==Types of waste==
Although the elimination of waste may seem like a simple and clear subject, it is noticeable that waste is often very conservatively identified. This then hugely reduces the potential of such an aim. The elimination of waste is the goal of lean, and Toyota defined three broad types of waste: ''muda'', ''muri'' and ''mura''; for many lean implementations this list shrinks to the first waste type only with reduced corresponding benefits.

To illustrate the state of this thinking Shigeo Shingo observed that only the last turn of a bolt tightens it—the rest is just movement. This ever finer clarification of waste is key to establishing distinctions between value-adding activity, waste and non-value-adding work.{{sfn|Ohno|1988|p=58}}{{fv|reason=The source speaks nothing about Shigeo Shingo, or a bolt tightening comparison|date=June 2018}} Non-value adding work is waste that must be done under the present work conditions. One key is to measure, or estimate, the size of these wastes, to demonstrate the effect of the changes achieved and therefore the movement toward the goal.

The "flow" (or smoothness) based approach aims to achieve JIT, by removing the variation caused by work scheduling and thereby provide a driver, rationale or target and priorities for implementation, using a variety of techniques. The effort to achieve JIT exposes many quality problems that are hidden by buffer stocks; by forcing smooth flow of only value-adding steps, these problems become visible and must be dealt with explicitly.

''Muri'' is all the unreasonable work that management imposes on workers and machines because of poor organization, such as carrying heavy weights, moving things around, dangerous tasks, even working significantly faster than usual. It is pushing a person or a machine beyond its natural limits. This may simply be asking a greater level of performance from a process than it can handle without taking shortcuts and informally modifying decision criteria. Unreasonable work is almost always a cause of multiple variations.

To link these three concepts is simple in TPS and thus lean. Firstly, ''muri'' focuses on the preparation and planning of the process, or what work can be avoided proactively by design.  Next, ''mura'' then focuses on how the work design is implemented and the elimination of fluctuation at the scheduling or operations level, such as quality and volume. ''Muda'' is then discovered after the process is in place and is dealt with reactively.  It is seen through variation in output.  It is the role of management to examine the ''muda'', in the processes and eliminate the deeper causes by considering the connections to the ''muri'' and ''mura'' of the system.  The ''muda'' and ''mura'' inconsistencies must be fed back to the ''muri'', or planning, stage for the next project.

A typical example of the interplay of these wastes is the corporate behaviour of "making the numbers" as the end of a reporting period approaches. Demand is raised to 'make plan,' increasing (''mura''), when the "numbers" are low, which causes production to try to squeeze extra capacity from the process, which causes routines and standards to be modified or stretched. This stretch and improvisation leads to ''muri''-style waste, which leads to downtime, mistakes and back flows, and waiting, thus the muda of waiting, correction and movement.

The original seven ''mudas'' are:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* Transport (moving products that are not actually required to perform the processing)
* Inventory (all components, [[work in process]], and finished product not being processed)
* Motion (people or equipment moving or walking more than is required to perform the processing)
* Waiting (waiting for the next production step, interruptions of production during shift change)
* Overproduction (production ahead of demand)
* Over Processing (resulting from poor tool or product design creating activity)
* Defects (the effort involved in inspecting for and fixing defects)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |&lt;!-- Under utilization of employees --&gt;|title=Lean Thinking |last=Womack |first=James P. |authorlink=James P. Womack|author2=Daniel T. Jones  |publisher=Free Press |year=2003 |page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2017}}

Eventually, an eighth "muda" was defined by Womack et al. (2003); it was described as manufacturing goods or services that do not meet customer demand or specifications. Many others have added the "waste of unused human talent" to the original seven wastes. For example, [[Six Sigma]] includes the waste of Skills, referred to as "under-utilizing capabilities and delegating tasks with inadequate training". Other additional wastes added were for example "space". These wastes were not originally a part of the seven deadly wastes defined by Taiichi Ohno in TPS, but were found to be useful additions in practice. In 1999 Geoffrey Mika in his book, "Kaizen Event Implementation Manual" added three more forms of waste that are now universally accepted; The waste associated with working to the wrong metrics or no metrics, the waste associated with not utilizing a complete worker by not allowing them to contribute ideas and suggestions and be part of Participative Management, and lastly the waste attributable to improper use of computers; not having the proper software, training on use and time spent surfing, playing games or just wasting time. For a complete listing of the "old" and "new" wastes see Bicheno and Holweg (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Lean Toolbox | last1 = Bicheno |first1= John  |last2 = Holweg | first2 = Matthias | publisher= PICSIE |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-9541244-5-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification of non-value-adding work, as distinct from wasted work, is critical to identifying the assumptions behind the current work process and to challenging them in due course.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Breakthroughs in SMED and other process changing techniques rely upon clear identification of where untapped opportunities may lie if the processing assumptions are challenged.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Lean implementation develops from TPS==

===Lean leadership===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}

The role of the leaders within the organization is the fundamental element of sustaining the progress of lean thinking. Experienced kaizen members at Toyota, for example, often bring up the concepts of ''Senpai'', ''Kohai'', and ''Sensei'', because they strongly feel that transferring of Toyota culture down and across Toyota can only happen when more experienced Toyota Sensei continuously coach and guide the less experienced lean champions.

One of the dislocative effects of lean is in the area of key performance indicators (KPI). The KPIs by which a plant/facility are judged will often be driving behaviour, because the KPIs themselves assume a particular approach to the work being done. This can be an issue where, for example a truly lean, [[Fixed Repeating Schedule]] (FRS) and JIT approach is adopted, because these KPIs will no longer reflect performance, as the assumptions on which they are based become invalid. It is a key leadership challenge to manage the impact of this KPI chaos within the organization.

Similarly, commonly used accounting systems developed to support mass production are no longer appropriate for companies pursuing lean. [[Lean accounting]] provides truly lean approaches to business management and financial reporting.

After formulating the guiding principles of its lean manufacturing approach in the Toyota Production System (TPS), Toyota formalized in 2001 the basis of its lean management: the key managerial values and attitudes needed to sustain continuous improvement in the long run. These core management principles are articulated around the twin pillars of Continuous Improvement (relentless elimination of waste) and Respect for People (engagement in long term relationships based on continuous improvement and mutual trust).

This formalization stems from problem solving. As Toyota expanded beyond its home base for the past 20 years, it hit the same problems in getting TPS properly applied that other western companies have had in copying TPS. Like any other problem, it has been working on trying a series of countermeasures to solve this particular concern. These countermeasures have focused on culture: how people behave, which is the most difficult challenge of all. Without the proper behavioral principles and values, TPS can be totally misapplied and fail to deliver results. As with TPS, the values had originally been passed down in a master-disciple manner, from boss to subordinate, without any written statement on the way. Just as with TPS, it was internally argued that formalizing the values would stifle them and lead to further misunderstanding. However, as Toyota veterans eventually wrote down the basic principles of TPS, Toyota set to put the Toyota Way into writing to educate new joiners.

Continuous Improvement breaks down into three basic principles:

# '''Challenge''': Having a long term vision of the challenges one needs to face to realize one's ambition (what we need to learn rather than what we want to do and then having the spirit to face that challenge). To do so, we have to challenge ourselves every day to see if we are achieving our goals.
# '''Kaizen''': Good enough never is, no process can ever be thought perfect, so operations must be improved continuously, striving for innovation and evolution.
# '''Genchi Genbutsu''': Going to the source to see the facts for oneself and make the right decisions, create consensus, and make sure goals are attained at the best possible speed.

Respect For People is less known outside of Toyota, and essentially involves two defining principles:

# '''Respect''': Taking every stakeholders' problems seriously, and making every effort to build mutual trust. Taking responsibility for other people reaching their objectives.
# '''Teamwork''': This is about developing individuals through team problem-solving. The idea is to develop and engage people through their contribution to team performance. Shop floor teams, the whole site as team, and team Toyota at the outset.

===Differences from TPS===
While lean is seen by many as a generalization of the Toyota Production System into other industries and contexts, there are some acknowledged differences that seem to have developed in implementation:{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

# '''Seeking profit''' is a relentless focus for Toyota exemplified by the profit maximization principle (Price – Cost = Profit) and the need, therefore, to practice systematic cost reduction (through TPS or otherwise) to realize benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smalley|first1=Art|title=TPS versus Lean and the Law of Unintended Consequences|url=https://www.lean.org/common/display/?o=196|website=Lean Enterprise Institute|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lean implementations can tend to de-emphasise this key measure and thus become fixated with the implementation of improvement concepts of "flow" or "pull". However, the emergence of the "value curve analysis" promises to directly tie lean improvements to bottom-line performance measurements.
# '''Tool orientation''' is a tendency in many programs to elevate mere tools (standardized work, value stream mapping, visual control, etc.) to an unhealthy status beyond their pragmatic intent. The tools are just different ways to work around certain types of problems but they do not solve them for you or always highlight the underlying cause of many types of problems. The tools employed at Toyota are often used to expose particular problems that are then dealt with, as each tool's limitations or blindspots are perhaps better understood. So, for example, [[Value Stream Mapping]] focuses upon material and information flow problems (a title built into the Toyota title for this activity) but is not strong on Metrics, Man or Method. Internally they well know the limits of the tool and understood that it was never intended as the best way to see and analyze every waste or every problem related to quality, downtime, personnel development, cross training related issues, capacity bottlenecks, or anything to do with profits, safety, metrics or morale, etc. No one tool can do all of that. For surfacing these issues other tools are much more widely and effectively used.
# '''Management technique rather than change agents''' has been a principle in Toyota from the early 1950s when they started emphasizing the development of the production manager's and supervisors' skills set in guiding natural work teams and did not rely upon staff-level change agents to drive improvements. This can manifest itself as a "Push" implementation of lean rather than "Pull" by the team itself. This area of skills development is not that of the change agent specialist, but that of the natural operations work team leader.  Although less prestigious than the TPS specialists, development of work team supervisors in Toyota is considered an equally, if not more important, topic merely because there are tens of thousands of these individuals. Specifically, it is these manufacturing leaders that are the main focus of training efforts in Toyota since they lead the daily work areas, and they directly and dramatically affect quality, cost, productivity, safety, and morale of the team environment.  In many companies implementing lean the reverse set of priorities is true. Emphasis is put on developing the specialist, while the supervisor skill level is expected to somehow develop over time on its own.
# '''Lack of understanding''' is one of the key reasons that a large share of lean manufacturing projects in the West fail to bring any benefit. In [[Factory Physics]], Hopp and Spearman describe this as ''romantic JIT'', where the belief in the methods is more important than the actual understanding and results. In this aspect, lean manufacturing is more of a religion than a science. Others have compared it to [[cargo cult science]].

==Lean services==
{{Main|Lean services}}

Lean principles have been successfully applied to various sectors and services, such as call centers and healthcare. In the former, lean's waste reduction practices have been used to reduce handle time,  within and between agent variation, accent barriers, as well as attain near perfect process adherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adsit |first1=Dennis |title=Cutting-Edge Methods Help Target Real Call Center Waste |url=http://www.isixsigma.com/library/content/c070611a.asp |publisher=iSixSigma.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414194658/http://www.isixsigma.com/library/content/c070611a.asp |archivedate=14 April 2008 |date=11 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2017}} In the latter, several hospitals have adopted the idea of ''lean hospital'', a concept that priorizes the patient, thus increasing the employee commitment and motivation, as well as boosting medical quality and cost effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alkalay|first1=M.|last2=Angerer|first2=A.|last3=Drews|first3=T.|last4=Jäggi|first4=C.|last5=Kämpfer|first5=M.|last6=Lenherr|first6=I.|last7=Valentin|first7=J.|last8=Vetterli|first8=C.|last9=Walker|first9=D.|editor1-last=Walker|editor1-first=Daniel|title=The Better Hospital: Excellence Through Leadership And Innovation|date=2015|publisher=Medizinisch Wissenschaftliche verlagsgesellschaft|isbn=9783954662241}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2017}}

Lean principles also have applications to software development and maintenance as well as other sectors of information technology (IT).&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Julia. “[http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5741.html Bringing ‘Lean’ Principles to Service Industries]”. ''HBS Working Knowledge''. October 22, 2007.

Upton. “Lean Principles, Learning, and Software Production: Evidence from Indian Software Services.”. Harvard Business School Working Paper. No. 08-001. July 2007. (Revised July 2008, March 2009.)&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the use of lean in information technology has become known as [[Lean IT]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Lean methods are also applicable to the public sector, but most results have been achieved using a much more restricted range of techniques than lean provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radnor|first1=Zoe|last2=Walley|first2=Paul|last3=Stephens|first3=Andrew|last4=Bucci|first4=Giovanni|title=Evaluation of the Lean Approach to Business Management and ITs Use in the Public Sector|date=2006|publisher=Scottish Executive Social Research|isbn=0755960564|page=|url=http://www.gov.scot/Resource/Doc/129627/0030899.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2017}}

The challenge in moving lean to services is the lack of widely available reference implementations to allow people to see how directly applying lean manufacturing tools and practices can work and the impact it does have. This makes it more difficult to build the level of belief seen as necessary for strong implementation. However, some research does relate widely recognized examples of success in retail and even airlines to the underlying principles of lean.&lt;ref name="ruffa" /&gt; Despite this, it remains the case that the direct manufacturing examples of 'techniques' or 'tools' need to be better 'translated' into a service context to support the more prominent approaches of implementation, which has not yet received the level of work or publicity that would give starting points for implementors. The upshot of this is that each implementation often 'feels its way' along as must the early [[industrial engineering]] practices of Toyota. This places huge importance upon sponsorship to encourage and protect these experimental developments.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Lean management is nowadays implemented also in non-manufacturing processes and administrative processes. In non-manufacturing processes is still huge potential for optimization and efficiency increase.&lt;ref&gt;JANUŠKA, M., ŠŤASTNÁ, L. Industrial Engineering in the Non-Manufacturing Processes.

==Goals and strategy==
The espoused goals of lean manufacturing systems differ between various authors. While some maintain an internal focus, e.g. to increase profit for the organization,&lt;ref name="Internal ex"&gt;e.g. Liker, J.K., 2004. The Toyota Way: 14 Management Principles from the World’s Greatest Manufacturer, New York: McGraw-Hill., Feld, W.M., 2001.

Japanese Manufacturing Techniques: Nine Hidden Lessons in Simplicity, New York: Free Press., Shingo, S., 1984. A Study of the Toyota Production System from an Industrial Engineering Viewpoint, Tokyo: Japan Management Association.&lt;/ref&gt; others claim that improvements should be done for the sake of the customer.&lt;ref name="external ex"&gt;e.g. Womack, J.P., Jones, D.T. &amp; Roos, D., 1990.

Some commonly mentioned goals are:{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
* Improve quality: To stay competitive in today's marketplace, a company must understand its customers' wants and needs and design processes to meet their expectations and requirements.
* Eliminate waste: Waste is any activity that consumes time, resources, or space but does not add any value to the product or service.
* Reduce time: Reducing the time it takes to finish an activity from start to finish is one of the most effective ways to eliminate waste and lower costs.
* Reduce total costs: To minimize cost, a company must produce only to customer demand. Overproduction increases a company’s inventory costs because of storage needs.

The strategic elements of lean can be quite complex, and comprise multiple elements. Four different notions of lean have been identified:&lt;ref name="Pettersen"&gt;Pettersen, J., 2009. Defining lean production: some conceptual and practical issues. The TQM Journal, 21(2), 127 - 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Lean as a fixed state or goal (being lean)
# Lean as a continuous change process (becoming lean)
# Lean as a set of tools or methods (doing lean/toolbox lean)
# Lean as a philosophy (lean thinking)

===Examples: Lean strategy in the global supply chain, and its crisis===

===Strategy===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}

Lean production has been adopted into other industries to promote productivity and efficiency in an ever changing market. In global supply chain and outsource scale, Information Technology is necessary and can deal with most of hard lean practices to synchronise pull system in supply chains and value system. The manufacturing industry can renew and change strategy of production just in time.

The supply chains take changes in deploying second factory or warehouse near their major markets in order to react consumers’ need promptly instead of investing manufacturing factories on the lost-cost countries. For instance, Dell sells computers directly from their website, cutting franchised dealers out of their supply chains. Then, the firm use outsourced partners to produce its components, deliver components to their assembly plants on these main markets around the world, like America and China.

Zara made decision of speeding their fashion to the consumers market by fast-producing cloths within five weeks with their local partners in Spain and never involved in mass production to pursue new styles and keep products fresh.

The other way to avoid market risk and control the supply efficiently is to cut down in stock. P&amp;G has done the goal to co-operate with Walmart and other wholesales companies by building the response system of stocks directly to the suppliers companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shining examples|url=http://www.economist.com/node/7032179|publisher=The Economist|location=Special report: Logistics|date=June 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=June 2017}}

With the improvement of global scale supply chains, firms apply lean practices (JIT, supplier partnership, and customer involvement) built between global firms and suppliers intensively to connect with consumers markets efficiently.

===Crisis===

After years of success of Toyota’s Lean Production, the consolidation of supply chain networks has brought Toyota to the position of being the world's biggest carmaker in the rapid expansion. In 2010, the crisis of safety-related problems in Toyota made other carmakers that duplicated Toyota’s supply chain system wary that the same recall issue might happen to them.

James Womack had warned Toyota that cooperating with single outsourced suppliers might bring unexpected problems.&lt;ref name="The Economist, 2010"&gt;The Economist, 2010, Toyota’s overstretched supply chain -The machine that ran too hot :The woes of the world’s biggest carmaker are a warning for rivals&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the crisis cost a great fortune and left Toyota thinking whether the JIT practice has problems about outsourced suppliers without enough experience and senior engineers could not achieve the monitoring job close to their suppliers out of Japan. That is proven as the economy of scale becomes global, the soft-learn practices become more important in their outsourced suppliers, if they could keep good Sensei relationship with their partners and constantly modify production process to perfection. Otherwise, Toyota begins to consider whether to have more choices of suppliers of producing the same component, it might bring more safety on risk-control and reduce the huge cost that might happen in the future.

The appliance of JIT in supply chain system is the key issue of Lean implementation in global scale. How do the supply partners avoid causing production flow? Global firms should make more suppliers who can compete with each other in order to get the best quality and lower the risk of production flow at the same time.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Steps to achieve lean systems==
The following steps should be implemented to create the ideal lean manufacturing system:&lt;ref name="Akinlawon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akinlawon|first1=Akin O.|title=Thinking of Lean Manufacturing Systems|url=http://www.sae.org/manufacturing/lean/column/leandec01.htm|publisher=SAE International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Design a simple manufacturing system
* Recognize that there is always room for improvement
* Continuously improve the lean manufacturing system design

===Design a simple manufacturing system===
A fundamental principle of lean manufacturing is demand-based flow manufacturing. In this type of production setting, inventory is only pulled through each production center when it is needed to meet a customer's order. The benefits of this goal include:&lt;ref name="Akinlawon"/&gt;

* Decreased cycle time
* Less inventory
* Increased productivity
* Increased capital equipment utilization

===Continuous improvement===
A continuous improvement mindset is essential to reach the company's goals. The term "continuous improvement" means incremental improvement of products, processes, or services over time, with the goal of reducing waste to improve workplace functionality, customer service, or product performance. Lean is founded on the concept of continuous and incremental improvements on product and process while eliminating redundant activities. "The value of adding activities are simply only those things the customer is willing to pay for, everything else is waste, and should be eliminated, simplified, reduced, or integrated" (Rizzardo, 2003).{{Full citation needed|date=June 2017}} Improving the flow of material through new ideal system layouts at the customer's required rate would reduce waste in material movement and inventory.&lt;ref name="Akinlawon"/&gt;{{Request quotation|date=June 2017}}

===Measure===
[[Overall equipment effectiveness]] (OEE) is a set of performance metrics that fit well in a lean environment. Also, PMTS, methods-time measurement, cost analysis and perhaps time study can be used to evaluate the wastes and IT effectiveness in the operational processes. For example, Jun-Ing Ker and Yichuan Wang analyze two prescribing technologies, namely no carbon required (NCR) and digital scanning technologies to quantify the advantages of the medication ordering, transcribing, and dispensing process in a multi-hospital health system. With comparison between these two technologies, the statistical analysis results show a significant reduction on process times by adopting digital scanning technology. The results indicated a reduction of 54.5% in queue time, 32.4% in order entry time, 76.9% in outgoing delay time, and 67.7% in outgoing transit time with the use of digital scanning technology.&lt;ref&gt;Ker, J. I., Wang, Y., Hajli, M. N., Song, J., &amp; Ker, C. W. (2014). Deploying lean in healthcare: Evaluating information technology effectiveness in US hospital pharmacies. International Journal of Information Management, 34(4), 556-560.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
One criticism of lean is that its practitioners may focus on tools and methodologies rather than on the philosophy and culture of lean. Consequently, adequate management is needed in order to avoid failed implementation of lean methodologies.&lt;ref name="Hopp_Spearman"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hopp |first=Wallace |last2=Spearman |first2=Mark |year=2008 |title=Factory Physics: Foundations of Manufacturing Management |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-07-282403-2 |url=http://www.factoryphysics.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another pitfall is that management decides what solution to use without understanding the true problem and without consulting shop floor personnel. As a result, lean implementations often look good to the manager but fail to improve the situation.&lt;ref name="Hopp_Spearman"/&gt;

In addition, many of the popular lean initiatives, coming from the TPS, are solutions to specific problems that Toyota was facing. Toyota, having an undesired current condition, determined what the end state would look like. Through much study, the gap was closed, which resulted in many of the tools in place today. Often, when a tool is implemented outside of TPS, a company believes that the solution lay specifically within one of the popular lean initiatives. The tools which were the solution to a specific problem for a specific company may not be able to be applied in exactly the same manner as designed. Thus, the solution does not fit the problem and a temporary solution is created vs. the actual root cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pederson|first=Joseph|title=Author|url=http://thebusinessdudeblog.com/2014/04/23/fancy-lean-terms-are-not-always-your-solution/|work=the business dude|publisher=WordPress.com|accessdate=27 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140427062032/http://thebusinessdudeblog.com/2014/04/23/fancy-lean-terms-are-not-always-your-solution/|archivedate=27 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lean philosophy aims to reduce costs while optimizing and improving performance. Value stream mapping (VSM) and 5S are the most common approaches companies take on their first steps towards making their organisation leaner. Lean actions can be focused on the specific logistics processes, or cover the entire supply chain. For example, you might start from analysis of SKUs (stock keeping units), using several days to identify and draw each SKUs path, evaluating all the participants from material suppliers to the consumer. Conducting a gap analysis determines the company's 'must take' steps to improve the value stream and achieve the objective. Based on that evaluation, the improvement group conducts the failure mode effects analysis (FMEA), in order to identify and prevent risk factors. It is crucial for front-line workers to be involved in VSM activities since they understood the process and can directly increase the efficiency. Although the impact may be small and limited for each lean activity, implementing a series small improvements incrementally along the supply chain can bring forth enhanced productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.inboundlogistics.com/cms/article/the-lean-supply-chain-watch-your-waste-line/|title=The Lean Supply Chain: Watch Your Waste Line|publisher=inboundlogistics|author=Merrill Douglas|date=June 2013|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After adopting the lean approach, both managers and employees experience change. Therefore, decisive leaders are needed when starting on a lean journey. There are several requirements to control the lean journey. First and most importantly, experts recommend that the organization have its own lean plan, developed by the lean Leadership. In other words, the lean team provides suggestions for the leader who then makes the actual decisions about what to implement. Second, coaching is recommended when the organization starts off on its lean journey. They will impart their knowledge and skills to shopfloor staff and the lean implementation will be much more efficient. Third, the metrics or measurements used for measuring lean and improvements are extremely important. It will enable collection of the data required for informed decision-making by a leader. One cannot successfully implement lean without sufficient aptitude at measuring the process and outputs. To control and improve results going forward, one must see and measure, i.e. map, what is happening now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dombrowski|first1=U.|last2=Mielke|first2=T|title=Lean Leadership – 15 Rules for a Sustainable Lean Implementation.|journal=Procedia CIRP|volume=17|pages=565–570|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lean manufacturing is different from lean enterprise. Recent research reports the existence of several lean manufacturing processes but of few lean enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nash-Hoff|first1=Michele|title=Why Lean Manufacturers Are Not Lean Enterprises |url=http://www.industryweek.com/blog/lean-sustainability-requires-change-culture|website=Industryweek.com.|publisher=Industryweek.com.|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One distinguishing feature opposes lean accounting and standard cost accounting. For standard cost accounting, SKUs are difficult to grasp. SKUs include too much hypothesis and variance, i.e., SKUs hold too much indeterminacy. Manufacturing may want to consider moving away from traditional accounting and adopting lean accounting. In using lean accounting, one expected gain is activity-based cost visibility, i.e., measuring the direct and indirect costs at each step of an activity rather than traditional cost accounting that limits itself to labor and supplies.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

'''Lee Gye-deok''' ([[Korea]]n: 이계덕, born 20 November 1986) is a South Korean [[singer]] and [[activist]] for [[civil rights|civil]] and [[human rights]] activist who promotes [[LGBT]] rights, typically for [[gay]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?SCD=JG31&amp;newsid=02381286593167032&amp;DCD=A00703&amp;OutLnkChk=Y "동성애자도 군대 가고 싶습니다"..."당신의 생각은?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924010213/http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?SCD=JG31&amp;newsid=02381286593167032&amp;DCD=A00703&amp;OutLnkChk=Y |date=2015-09-24 }} ''[[E-Daliy]]'' 1 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
Lee was elected as a non-adult representative of the [[Democratic Labor Party (South Korea)|Democratic Labor Party of Korea]] and attracted a great deal of attention from the public, because that was the first case a youth was elected as a representative for a party. He resigned from his post due to his frustrations on the reality of the political field in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2005062429478&amp;path_dir=20050624 "Lee Gye-deok: “Only Quarrels Exist in Political Field"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714134630/http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2005062429478&amp;path_dir=20050624 |date=2014-07-14 }} ''[[Donga Ilbo]]'' 1 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gay riot police officer and singer for promoting LGBT rights ==
Lee was a riot police officer at Yongsan Police Station and the first Korean riot policeman who [[coming out|came out as gay]].

As he continually called for dismantling of the Korean riot police, the [[National Police Agency (South Korea)|Korean National Police Agency]] filed for a warrant for his arrest after reports he tried to touch the body parts of 13 colleagues without their permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/07/113_26865.html "Gay Riot Police Officer Accused of Sexual Assault"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714212800/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/07/113_26865.html |date=2014-07-14 }} ''[[Korea Times]]'' 1 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, he and many people believed this was done in revenge, because Lee drew public attention when he came out of the closet earlier this year. He recently filed for a transfer saying the environment did not fit his work and political ethics. The Ministry of Defense of Korea has reportedly turned down the transfer request.

Even though Lee was a policeman, he criticized the National Police in his song, the Seoul Central District Court has ruled that he is fee to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2014/06/117_46130.html "Court Allows Song Critical of Police"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808055820/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2014/06/117_46130.html |date=2014-08-08 }} ''[[Korea Times]]'' 2 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He was dismissed as a riot policeman after three years of legal disputes with the agency.

== Promoting gay awareness advertisements ==

Lee petitioned for an ad to be posted on Gyodae Station’s electronic banners that said “Anyone amongst Seoul’s citizens may be a sexual minority. All citizens have the right to not be discriminated against their sexual orientation.” He paid for it with 3 million won out of his own pocket.

Eunpyoung, Yongsan, Gwangjin, Geumcheon, Joonggu, Jongro Districts allowed the advertisement campaigns, but [[Seocho District]] rejected his advertisements and he said it was “discrimination without reason” and advised them to “find a way to prevent ads are not refused just because the subject matter is about homosexuality or other sexual orientations.” They revealed that “Even if a few members of society who hold hatred and prejudices against homosexuality send in complaints about an ad about gay awareness, the national and regional government has an obligation to protect and form a social consensus so that social minorities do not become the target of unfair discrimination and oppression.”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://peaceshannon.tumblr.com/post/41275008650/human-rights-committee-criticizes-seocho-gu-office-for "Human Rights Committee Criticizes Seocho District for Banning Ad Promoting Gay Awareness "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812101228/http://peaceshannon.tumblr.com/post/41275008650/human-rights-committee-criticizes-seocho-gu-office-for |date=2014-08-12 }} ''Korean Feminism, Sexuality, and Popular Culture'' 23 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Literal and figurative language''' is a distinction within some fields of [[language]] analysis, in particular [[Stylistics (field of study)|stylistics]], [[rhetoric]], and [[semantics]]. 
*'''Literal language''' uses words exactly according to their conventionally accepted [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]s or [[denotation]].
*'''Figurative''' (or '''non-literal''') '''language''' uses words in a way that deviates from their conventionally accepted definitions in order to convey a more complicated meaning or heightened effect.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/figure%20of%20speech Figure of speech]." ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''. Merriam-Webster, Inc. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Figurative language is often created by presenting words in such a way that they are equated, compared, or associated with normally unrelated meanings.

Literal usage confers meaning to words, in the sense of the meaning they have by themselves, outside any figure of speech.&lt;ref name="JaszczoltTurner2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaszczolt|first1=Katarzyna M..|last2=Turner|first2=Ken|title=Meaning Through Language Contrast.

[[Aristotle]] and later the Roman [[Quintilian]] were among the early analysts of [[rhetoric]] who expounded on the differences between literal and figurative language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|DUPLICATE_title=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUEtEa9nUWQC&amp;pg=PA129|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|isbn=9780495898023|edition=10|author1=M.H. Abrams|author2=Geoffrey Harpham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1769, [[Frances Brooke]]'s novel ''The History of Emily Montague'' was used in the earliest ''Oxford English Dictionary'' citation for the figurative sense of ''literally''; the sentence from the novel used was, "He is a fortunate man to be introduced to such a party of fine women at his arrival; it is literally ''to feed among the lilies''."&lt;ref name="languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu"&gt;[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=5914]&lt;/ref&gt; This citation was also used in the OED's 2011 revision.&lt;ref name="languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu"/&gt;

Within literary analysis, such terms are still used; but within the fields of cognition and linguistics, the basis for identifying such a distinction is no longer used.&lt;ref name="BarberStainton2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barber|first1=Alex|last2=Stainton|first2=Robert J|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Philosophy of Language and Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2boGE2NKtpsC&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=23 December 2012|date=2009-11-20|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080965000|pages=230–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figurative language in literary analysis==
{{original research|section|date=August 2010}}
Figurative language can take multiple forms, such as [[simile]] or [[metaphor]].&lt;ref name="MontgomeryDurant2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montgomery|first1=Martin|last2=Durant|first2=Alan|last3=Fabb|first3=Nigel |author4=Tom Furniss |author5=Sara Mills|title=Ways of Reading: Advanced Reading Skills for Students of English Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhrYfYdHuN8C&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=3 April 2013|date=2007-01-09|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203597118|pages=117–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia Of Literature'' says that figurative language can be classified in five categories: resemblance or relationship, emphasis or [[understatement]], figures of sound, verbal games, and errors.&lt;ref name="inc1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Merriam-Webster, inc.|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia Of Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C|accessdate=23 April 2013|year=1995|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=9780877790426|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA415 415]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J., and [[Dana Gioia]]. [[An Introduction To Poetry]]. 13th ed. Longman Pub Group, 2007. Pg 594.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[metaphor]]&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1525–35; &lt; Latin ''metaphora''  &lt; Greek ''metaphorá''  a transfer, akin to ''metaphérein'' to transfer. See meta-, -phore{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com.nuncio.cofc.edu/Entry/117328|work=metaphor, n.|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|title=Metaphor}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a figure of speech in which two "essentially unlike things" are shown to have a type of resemblance or create a new image.&lt;ref name="Miller2001"/&gt; The similarities between the objects being compared may be implied rather than directly stated.&lt;ref name="Miller2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Carol Rawlings|title=Irresistible Shakespeare: 6 Sensational Scenes from Favorite Plays and Dozens of Fun Ideas That Introduce Students to the Wonderful Works of Shakespeare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qT3BC2CH1LoC&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=23 December 2012|date=2001-03-01|publisher=Scholastic Inc.|isbn=9780439098441|pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[extended metaphor]] is a metaphor that is continued over multiple sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/extended-metaphor|work=extended metaphor|publisher=Dictionary.com|title=Extended Metaphor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=Mary|title=Poetry Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fuBHMccJx6UC&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=6 March 2013|year=1994|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780156724005|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Example: "The sky steps out of her daywear/Slips into her shot-silk evening dress./An entourage of bats whirr and swing at her hem, ...She's tried on every item in her wardrobe." [[Dilys Rose]]&lt;ref name="LiddellGifford2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liddell|first1=Gordon F.|last2=Gifford|first2=Anne|title=New Scottish poetry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQRs8Uz6480C&amp;pg=PA131|accessdate=3 April 2013|date=2001-07-26|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=9780435150983|pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Onomatopoeia]] is a word designed to be an imitation of a sound.&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1570–80; &lt; Late Latin &lt; Greek ''onomatopoiía'' making of words = onomato-  (combining form of ónoma name) + poi-  (stem of poieîn to make; see poet) + -ia -ia{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com.nuncio.cofc.edu/Entry/131486|work=onomatopoeia, n.|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|title=Onomatopoeia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Example: “Bark! Bark!” went the dog as he chased the car that vroomed past.

[[Personification]]&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1745–55; personi(fy) + -fication{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com.nuncio.cofc.edu/Entry/141506|work=personification, n.|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|title=Personification}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the attribution of a personal nature or character to inanimate objects or abstract notions,&lt;ref name="Moustaki2001"/&gt; especially as a rhetorical figure.
: Example: "Because I could not stop for Death,/He kindly stopped for me;/The carriage held but just ourselves/And Immortality."—[[Emily Dickinson]]. Dickinson portrays death as a carriage driver.&lt;ref name="Moustaki2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moustaki|first=Nikki|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing Poetry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RdH3hvXEIB8C&amp;pg=PT146|accessdate=23 December 2012|date=2001-04-01|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781440695636|pages=146–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[oxymoron]] is a figure of speech in which a pair of opposite or contradictory terms is used together for emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;Origin: &lt; post-classical Latin oxymoron, figure of speech in which a pair of opposed or markedly contradictory terms are placed in conjunction for emphasis (5th cent.; also ''oxymorum'') &lt; ancient Greek ὀξυ-oxy- comb. form1+ μωρόςdull, stupid, foolish (see moron n.2).{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com.nuncio.cofc.edu/Entry/135679|work=oxymoron|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|title=Oxymoron}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Examples: Organized chaos, Same difference, Bittersweet.

A [[paradox]] is a statement or proposition which is self-contradictory, unreasonable, or illogical.&lt;ref&gt;Origin:  &lt; Middle French, French ''paradoxe'' (1495 as noun; 1372–4 in plural ''paradoxesas'' the title of a work by Cicero; paradoxon (noun) philosophical paradox in post-classical Latin also a figure of speech &lt; ancient Greek παράδοξον, especially in plural παράδοξαStoical paradoxes, use as noun of neuter singular of παράδοξος (adjective) contrary to received opinion or expectation &lt; παρα-para- prefix1+ δόξαopinion (see doxology n.), after ancient Greek παρὰ δόξανcontrary to expectation{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com.nuncio.cofc.edu/Entry/137353|work=paradox, n.|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|title=Paradox}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Example: This statement is a lie.

[[Hyperbole]] is a figure of speech which uses an extravagant or exaggerated statement to express strong feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Origin:  &lt; Greek ὑπερβολήexcess (compare hyperbola n.), exaggeration; the latter sense is first found in Isocrates and Aristotle. Compare French hyperbole(earlier yperbole).{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com.nuncio.cofc.edu/Entry/90286|work=hyperbol e, n.|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|title=Hyperbole}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Example: They had been walking so long that John thought he might drink the entire lake when they came upon it.

[[Allusion]] is a reference to a famous character or event.
: Example: A single step can take you through the looking glass if you're not careful.

An [[idiom]] is an expression that has a figurative meaning unrelated to the literal meaning of the phrase.
:Example: You should keep your eye out for him.
:To keep an eye out for someone means to watch out for them.

A [[pun]] is an expression intended for a humorous or rhetorical effect by exploiting different meanings of words.
: Example: I wondered why the ball was getting bigger. Then it hit me.
: "Then it hit me." has two different meanings

==Standard pragmatic model of comprehension==
Prior to the 1980s, the "standard pragmatic" model of comprehension was widely believed. In that model, it was thought the recipient would first attempt to comprehend the meaning as if literal, but when an appropriate literal inference could not be made, the recipient would shift to look for a figurative interpretation that would allow comprehension.&lt;ref name="Katz1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Albert N.|title=Figurative Language and Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSxhb_fZLx0C&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=20 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195109634|pages=166–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, research has cast doubt on the model. In tests, figurative language was found to be comprehended at the same speed as literal language; and so the premise that the recipient was first attempting to process a literal meaning and discarding it before attempting to process a figurative meaning appears to be false.&lt;ref name="EysenckKeane2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eysenck|first1=Michael William|last2=Keane|first2=Mark T.|title=Cognitive Psychology: A Student's Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22ZWi-LVLDcC&amp;pg=PA369|accessdate=20 December 2012|year=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781841693590|pages=369–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reddy and contemporary views==
Beginning with the work of [[Michael Reddy (linguist)|Michael Reddy]] in his 1979 work "[[Conduit metaphor|The Conduit Metaphor]]", many linguists now reject that there is a valid way to distinguish between a "literal" and "figurative" mode of language.&lt;ref name="Ortony1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ortony|first=Andrew|title=Metaphor and Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QiJRvuXA_VcC&amp;pg=PA204|accessdate=20 December 2012|date=1993-11-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521405614|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3125">'''Modesty in medical settings''' refers to the practices and equipment used to preserve patient [[modesty]] in medical examination and clinics.

==Tools for modesty==

Prior to the invention of the [[stethoscope]], a physician who wanted to perform [[auscultation]] to listen to [[heart sounds]] or noise inside a body would have to physically place their ear against the body of the person being examined.&lt;ref name="Roguin"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Ariel Roguin | title = Rene Theophile Hyacinthe Laennec (1781-1826): the man behind the stethoscope | journal = Clinical Medicine &amp; Research | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 230–235 | date=September 2006 | pmid = 17048358 | doi=10.3121/cmr.4.3.230 | pmc=1570491}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, male physician [[René Laennec]] invented the stethoscope as a way to respect the modesty of a female patient, as it would have been awkward for him to put his ear on her chest.&lt;ref name="Roguin"/&gt;

[[Hospital gowns]] increase modesty as compared to the patient presenting nude, but in the past have been odd clothing which exposes the body.&lt;ref name="Shefali"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/04/hospital-gowns-get-a-makeover/389258/ |title=Hospital Gowns Get a Makeover — The Atlantic |first=Shefali |last=Luthra |work=theatlantic.com |date=4 April 2015 |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary changes to the design of hospital gowns are proposed.&lt;ref name="Shefali"/&gt;

==Society and culture==
In places with more [[cultural diversity]] it becomes more likely that people will make new and different requests for modesty in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seibert|first1=PS|last2=Stridh-Igo|first2=P|last3=Zimmerman|first3=CG|title=A checklist to facilitate cultural awareness and sensitivity.|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=June 2002|volume=28|issue=3|pages=143–6|pmid=12042396|doi=10.1136/jme.28.3.143|pmc=1733575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special populations==
Sometimes women do not access healthcare because of modesty concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoueri-Mychasiw|first1=N|last2=Campbell|first2=S|last3=Mai|first3=V|title=Increasing screening mammography among immigrant and minority women in Canada: a review of past interventions.|journal=[[Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health]]|date=February 2013|volume=15|issue=1|pages=149–58|doi=10.1007/s10903-012-9612-8|pmid=22466249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims in non-Muslim societies sometimes make requests for modesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rassool|first1=GH|title=Cultural competence in nursing Muslim patients.|journal=Nursing times|date=April 2015|volume=111|issue=14|pages=12–5|pmid=26182584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boucher|first1=NA|last2=Siddiqui|first2=EA|last3=Koenig|first3=HG|title=Supporting Muslim Patients During Advanced Illness.|journal=The Permanente journal|date=2017|volume=21|doi=10.7812/TPP/16-190|pmid=28609264|pmc=5469433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The One Million Masterpiece''' (abbreviated OMM) is the largest artistic collaboration ever attempted. It is an ongoing project to produce a true piece of global artwork.  As of October 16, 2007, 26,582 artists from 174 countries have participated, with $19,348.57 raised for charities worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The original project website was launched on July 14, 2006 by London-based artist Paul Fisher.  The site uses an Adobe Flash drawing tool to enable members to contribute images drawn on screen using a mouse or digipad, and an AJAX viewer which displays the whole artwork mosaic.

The website has developed and further [[social networking]] elements have been added.  Artists can rate one another's contributions, communicate via messages and maintain a profile page.

==Participation==
Participation is free to anyone with access to the internet.  Participants are each given a square where they can use a built-in drawing tool to create an image.  (These individual images combined are what will make up the final project as a giant mosaic.)  The project is open to, and intended for, all willing participants.  One need not be artistically trained, in order to participate.

'''Celebrity Involvement'''

Celebrity contributors include [[Peaches Geldof]], electric violinist [[Linzi Stoppard]], playwright [[Tom Stoppard]], doctor and health commentator [[Miriam Stoppard]], [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] frontman and artist [[Holly Johnson]], cult comedy icon [[Karl Pilkington]], businessman and socialite Sebastien Sainsbury and [[Supremes]] band member [[Susaye Greene]].

==Aims==
'''Artistic and Charitable'''

The One Million Masterpiece aims to produce a piece of public artwork that will provide a snapshot of global society.  It is intended that the final artwork be completed for unveiling on [[World Population Day]] 2008 and hopes to raise over $1 million for the projects charity partners [[Save the Children]], [[Oxfam]], [[ActionAid]] and [[World Cancer Research Fund]].  {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

'''World Record'''

The artwork also officially qualifies as a new world record.  The previous official record for the most artists completing a single picture was held by the painting A Little Dab of Texas, designed by Jim Campbell of [[Brenham]], [[Texas]], United States.  The picture was painted by 25,297 people and was completed in 3 years, 7 months on June 14, 1998.

==Recurring Elements Within Image (Space Monkeys)==

As the project is still underway, it is largely wondered whether the final image will have a thematic unity or if it will be a chaotic series of unrelated images.  Many recurring elements can be found throughout the work.  The most notable of these recurring elements are what have been dubbed "space monkeys."  Space monkeys are small circular faces, typically cartoonish in nature and rudimentary in style.  They are believed to have originated within Laura Dixon's picture—but they soon began to appear in pictures  throughout the project.

Other common recurring elements include:  views of the earth from space, eyes, hearts, and flowers.

==Video Replay of Drawing Process==
The OMM site's adobe drawing tool includes a feature that enables a video replay of the drawing process for each picture.  This feature has led several participants to not only create digital paintings, but also digital videos.  Angeli Arndt uses this feature in her artwork entitled "I'm Always Changing For You," to show a human face changing over time.  This video functionality adds a dimension to the project that is not noticeable when simply viewing still images of the project.

==Exhibition==
When completed The One Million Masterpiece will measure 80 metres in width and 31 meters in height and each individual contribution will be a 5&amp;nbsp;cm by 5&amp;nbsp;cm square. It is proposed that the final piece will be printed and unveiled in Central [[London]] on [[World Population Day]] 2008.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

==Controversy==
There has been controversy within the OMM community regarding content of individual artworks.  Some participants have complained that certain artworks are [[pornographic]] and/or [[obscene]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}  Occasionally, a participant will demand that the artwork of another participant be deleted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1004">'''Phonemic imagery''' refers to the processing of thoughts as words rather than as symbols or other images.  It is sometimes referred to as the equivalent of [[Intrapersonal communication|inner speech]]&lt;ref name=Velmans/&gt; or [[Imagined speech|covert speech]],{{cn|date=December 2013}} and sometimes considered as a third phenomenon, separate from but similar to these other forms of internal speech.{{cn|date=December 2013}}

Phonemic imagery is a part of the philosophy of [[consciousness]] rather than [[linguistics]] as it is considered an internal phenomenon of consciousness observed through [[Introspection|reflection]] rather than amenable to [[empirical]] observation.

{{Jainism}}
In [[Jainism]], '''''Pratima''''' ({{lang-sa|प्रतिमा}}) is a step or a stage marking the spiritual rise of a [[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|lay person]] (''shravak''). There are eleven such steps called ''pratima''.&lt;ref&gt;Shravakachar Sangrah, Five Volumes, Hiralal Jain Shastri, Jain Sanskruti Samrakshak Sangh Solapur, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; After having passed the eleven steps, one is no longer a ''sravaka'', but a ''muni'' ([[Jain monasticism|monk]]).

Rules prescribed for laymen are divided into twelve ''vrata'' (vows) and eleven ''pratimas'' (steps){{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=77}} and are described in several codes of conduct ([[Ratnakaranda|''shravakacharas'']]).&lt;ref&gt;Jaina yoga: a survey of the mediaeval śrāvakācāras By R. Williams&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''pratimas'' are mentioned in several ancient texts like [[Ratnakaranda Shravakachara]] (2nd century A.D.).&lt;ref&gt;Upasakdashang aur uska Shravakachar, Subhash Kothari, Agam Ahimsa Samta Evam Prakrit Sansthan, Udaipur  1988&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eleven ''Pratima'' ==
The eleven stages (''pratima'') are:{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=83}}
#Darshan Pratima (Right perspective): The worship of the true God (i.e., tirthanhara,) guru (preceptor) and shastra (Scripture), and the avoidance of gambling, meat-eating, drinking (wine), adultery, hunting, thieving and debauchery.
#Vrat Pratima: The keeping of the twelve vows and the vow to observe [[sallekhana]] (at the end of one's life)
#Samayak Pratima (Periodic meditation): Engaging in meditation or worship on a regular basis. 
#Proshadhopvas Pratima (periodic fasting): fasting four times in a month.
#Sachitta Tyaga Pratima: not eating vegetables having the capacity to grow again.
#Ratribhukti Tyaga Pratima (or Diva Maithun Tyaga Pratima): Giving up eating during the night or coitus during the day.
#Brahmacharya Pratima (celibacy): abstaining from sex or related activity.
#Arambha Tyaga Pratima (giving up occupations): refraining from any activity to earn a living.
#Parigraha Tyaga Pratima (giving up possessions): detachment from most possessions.
#Anurnati Tyaga Pratima (giving up right to give permissions): refraining from giving orders or expressing consents in the family.
#Uddishta Tyaga Pratima: The complete renunciation of the householder’s life, retiring into a forest and adopting the rules laid down for the guidance of monks.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=84}}

Ashadhara in his Sagara-Dharmammrata (13th century) has groups the 11 steps into three ranks.

*Grahin (jaghanya: first to sixth pratima)
*Varnin (madhyama: seventh to ninth pratima): At this point the householder is termed a [[Varni]]. The pratimas are:
*Bhikshuka (uttama: tenth and eleventh pratima): At this point a person depends on others for daily survival.

Those who have ascended to the eleventh pratima are termed [[Kshullaka]] (with two articles of clothing) and [[Jain Muni|Ailaka]] (with only one piece of cloth) in the [[Digambara]] tradition. The eleventh pratima is termed Shramanabhuta Pratima (being almost like a Shramana) in the [[Svetambara]] tradition. The next step is that of a full [[Jain muni|Jain Muni]].

A '''pressure–volume diagram''' (or '''PV diagram''', or '''volume–pressure loop''')&lt;ref&gt;{{GeorgiaPhysiology|3/3ch5/s3ch5_16}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to describe corresponding changes in [[volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] and [[pressure]] in a system.  They are commonly used in [[thermodynamics]], [[cardiovascular physiology]], and [[respiratory physiology]].

PV diagrams, originally called '''indicator diagrams''', were developed in the 18th century as tools for understanding the efficiency of [[steam engine]]s.

==Description==
A PV diagram plots the change in pressure ''P'' with respect to volume ''V'' for some [[thermodynamic process|process]] or processes.  Typically in thermodynamics, the set of processes forms a [[thermodynamic cycle|cycle]], so that upon completion of the cycle there has been no net change in [[thermodynamic state|state]] of the system; i.e. the device returns to the starting pressure and volume.

The figure shows the features of a typical PV diagram.  A series of numbered states (1 through 4) are noted.  The path between each state consists of some process (A through D) which alters the pressure or volume of the system (or both).
[[File:P-v diagram of a simple cycle.svg|none|230px|Generalized PV diagram]]
A key feature of the diagram is that the amount of energy expended or received by the system as [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] can be estimated as the area under the curve on the chart.  For a cyclic diagram, the net work is that ''enclosed'' by the curve.  In the example given in the figure, the processes 1-2-3 produce a work output, but processes from 3-4-1 require a smaller energy input to return to the starting position / state;  thus the net work is the difference between the two.

Note that this figure is highly idealized, and a diagram showing the processes in a real device would tend to depict a more complex shape of the PV curve.  (See section Applications, below).

==History==
[[Image:Indicator diagram.png|thumb|right|Watt's indicator diagram]]
[[Image:Steam indicator (Steam and the Steam Engine - Land and Marine, 1875).jpg|thumb|right|Richard's indicator instrument of 1875]]
The PV diagram, then called an indicator diagram, was developed by [[James Watt]] and his employee [[John Southern (engineer)|John Southern]] (1758–1815) to improve the [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiency]] of engines.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Hunt (2010) ''Pursuing Power and Light'', page 13, [[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] {{ISBN|0-8018-9359-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1796, Southern developed the simple, but critical, technique to generate the diagram by fixing a board so as to move with the piston, thereby tracing the "volume" axis, while a [[pencil]], attached to a [[pressure gauge]], moved at right angles to the piston, tracing "pressure".

The gauge enabled Watt to calculate the work done by the steam while ensuring that its pressure had dropped to zero by the end of the stroke, thereby ensuring that all useful [[energy]] had been extracted. The total work could be calculated from the area between the "volume" axis and the traced line. The latter fact had been realised by [[Davies Gilbert]] as early as 1792 and used by [[Jonathan Hornblower]] in [[litigation]] against Watt over [[patent]]s on various designs. [[Daniel Bernoulli]] had also had the insight about how to calculate work.

Watt used the diagram to make radical improvements to steam engine performance and long kept it a trade secret. Though it was made public in a letter to the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'' in 1822,&lt;ref&gt;(Anonymous), "Account of a steam-engine indicator," ''Quarterly Journal of Science'', vol. 13, page 95 (1822).&lt;/ref&gt; it remained somewhat obscure. [[John Farey, Jr.]] only learned of it on seeing it used, probably by Watt's men, when he visited Russia in 1826.

In 1834, [[Émile Clapeyron]] used a diagram of pressure against volume to illustrate and elucidate the [[Carnot cycle]], elevating it to a central position in the study of [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;Clapeyron, E. (1834) "Mémoire sur la puissance motrice de la chaleur" (Memoir on the motive power of heat), ''Journal de l'École Royale Polytechnique'', vol. 14, no. 23, pages 153–190, 160–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later instruments (''illus.'') used paper wrapped around a cylindrical barrel with a pressure piston inside it, the rotation of the barrel coupled to the piston crosshead by a weight- or spring-tensioned wire.

In 1869 the British marine engineer [[Nicholas Procter Burgh]] wrote a full book on the indicator diagram explaining the device step by step. He had noticed that "a very large proportion of the young members of the engineering profession look at an indicator diagram as a mysterious production."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Procter Burgh]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qSdWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 The Indicator Diagram Practically Considered].'' E. &amp; F. N. Spon, 1869. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Thermodynamics===
PV diagrams can be used to estimate the net work performed by a [[thermodynamic cycle]].  The net work is the area enclosed by the PV curve in the diagram.  This usage derived from the development of indicator diagrams which were used to estimate the performance of a [[steam engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the diagram records the [[pressure]] of steam versus the volume of steam in a [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], throughout a [[piston]]'s cycle of motion in a steam engine.  The diagram enables calculation of the [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] performed and thus can provide a measure of the power produced by the engine.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Hills and A. J. Pacey (January 1972) "The measurement of power in early steam-driven textile mills," ''Technology and Culture'', vol. 13, no. 1, pages 25–43.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Indicator diagram steam admission.svg|none|450px||Indicator diagram for steam locomotive]]

To exactly calculate the work done by the system it is necessary to calculate the integral of the pressure with respect to volume.  One can often quickly calculate this using the PV diagram as it is simply the area enclosed by the cycle.

Note that in some cases [[specific volume]] will be plotted on the x-axis instead of volume, in which case the area under the curve represents work per unit mass of the working fluid (i.e. J/kg).

{{main|Pressure-volume loop analysis in cardiology}}
In [[cardiovascular physiology]], the diagram is often applied to the [[left ventricle]], and it can be mapped to specific events of the [[cardiac cycle]]. [[Pressure-volume loop analysis in cardiology|PV loop studies]] are widely used in basic research and [[Biomedical research|preclinical testing]], to [[Pressure-Volume Loop Analysis in Cardiology|characterize the intact heart's performance under various situations]] (effect of drugs, disease, characterization of mouse [[Strain (biology)|strains]]),

The sequence of events occurring in every heart cycle is as follows. The left figure shows a PV loop from a real experiment; letters refer to points.

* '''A''' is the end-[[Diastole|diastolic]] point; this is the point where contraction begins. Pressure starts to increase, becomes rapidly higher than the atrial pressure, and the mitral valve closes. Since pressure is also lower than the aortic pressure, the aortic valve is closed as well.
* Segment '''AB''' is the contraction phase. Since both the mitral and aortic valves are closed, volume is constant. For this reason, this phase is called isovolumic contraction.
* At point '''B''', pressure becomes higher than the aortic pressure and the aortic valve opens, initiating ejection.
* '''BC''' is the ejection phase, volume decreases. At the end of this phase, pressure lowers again and falls below aortic pressure. The aortic valve closes.
* Point '''C''' is the end-[[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] point.
* Segment '''CD''' is the isovolumic relaxation. During this phase, pressure continues to fall. The mitral valve and aortic valve are both closed again so volume is constant.
* At point '''D''' pressure falls below the atrial pressure and the mitral valve opens, initiating ventricular filling.
* '''DA''' is the [[Diastole|diastolic]] filling period. Blood flows from the left atrium to the left ventricle. Atrial contraction completes ventricular filling.

As it can be seen, the PV loop forms a roughly rectangular shape and each loop is formed in an anti-clockwise direction.

Very useful information can be derived by examination and analysis of individual loops or series of loops, for example: 
* the horizontal distance between the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner of each loop is the [[stroke volume]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.uc.edu/kranias/cardiac_function.htm Diagram at uc.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;
* the line joining the top-left corner of several loops is the contractile or [[inotropic state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvphysiology.com/Heart%20Failure/HF005.htm Systolic dysfunction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20122">'''Primary consciousness''' is a term the American biologist [[Gerald Edelman]] coined to describe the ability, found in humans and some animals, to integrate observed events with memory to create an [[awareness]] of the present and immediate past of the world around them. This form of [[consciousness]] is also sometimes called "sensory consciousness". Put another way, primary consciousness is the presence of various [[subjectivity|subjective]] sensory contents of consciousness such as [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s, [[perception]]s, and mental images. For example, primary consciousness includes a person's experience of the blueness of the ocean, a bird's song, and the feeling of pain. Thus, primary consciousness refers to  being mentally aware of things in the world in the present without any sense of past and future; it is composed of mental images bound to a time around the measurable present.&lt;ref name = Edelmansky&gt;Edelman, G. (2004). ''Wider than the sky: The phenomenal gift of consciousness'': Yale Univ Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[secondary consciousness|higher order consciousness]] can be described as being "conscious of being conscious"; it includes reflective thought, a concept of the past, and speculation about the future.

Primary consciousness can be subdivided into two forms, focal [[awareness]] and peripheral awareness. Focal awareness encompasses the center of [[attention]], whereas peripheral awareness consists of things outside the center of attention, which a person or animal is only dimly aware of.&lt;ref name = Johanson&gt;Johanson, M., Revonsuo, A., Chaplin, J., &amp; Wedlund, J.-E. (2003). Level and contents of consciousness in connection with partial epileptic seizures. ''Epilepsy &amp; Behavior'', 4(3), 279–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
One prominent [[theory]] for the [[neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] basis of primary consciousness was proposed by Gerald Edelman. This theory of consciousness is premised upon three major assumptions:
# The laws of [[physics]] apply to [[consciousness]], which rules out concepts such as spirits and a soul and allows for a purely [[physiology|physiological]] model of consciousness.
# Consciousness is an evolved characteristic, which means it is a helpful characteristic from a [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] perspective.
# There is no such thing as a "[[qualia]]-free" observer. Qualia are collections of personal or subjective experiences, feelings, and sensations that inevitably come with human awareness.&lt;ref name = Edelmantheory/&gt;

Edelman's theory focuses on two [[nervous system]] organizations: the [[brainstem]] and [[limbic system]]s on one side and the [[thalamus]] and [[cerebral cortex]] on the other side. The brain stem and limbic system take care of essential body functioning and survival, while the thalamocortical system receives signals from sensory receptors and sends out signals to voluntary muscles such as those of the arms and legs. The theory asserts that the connection of these two systems during [[evolution]] helped animals learn [[adaptive behavior]]s.&lt;ref name = Edelmansky/&gt; This connection allows past signals related to values set by the limbic-brain stem system and categorized signals from the outside world to be correlated, resulting in memory in conceptual areas. This memory is then linked to the organism's ''current'' perception, which results in an awareness of the present, or primary consciousness. In other words, Edelman posits that primary consciousness arises from the correlation of ''conceptual'' memory to a set of ''ongoing'' perceptual categorizations—a "remembered present".&lt;ref name = Edelmansky/&gt;

Other scientists have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged with the basic vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from [[sensory neuron|sensors]] and [[sensory receptors|receptors]], both internal and surface, signaling that the well-being of the creature was immediately threatened—for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the [[thalamus|thalamic]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal]], [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]], [[insular cortex|insula]], and [[midbrain]] sites are the key to consciousness of thirst.&lt;ref name = Merker&gt;Merker, B. (2007). Consciousness without a cerebral cortex: A challenge for neuroscience and medicine. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 30(01), 63–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

These scientists also point out that the cortex might not be as important to primary consciousness as some neuroscientists have believed.&lt;ref name = Merker/&gt; Evidence of this lies in the fact that studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness.&lt;ref name = Merker/&gt; Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.

==Neurophysiological basis==
Physiologically, three fundamental facts stand out about primary consciousness:&lt;ref name = SethND&gt;Seth, A. K., &amp; Baars, B. J. (2005). Neural Darwinism and consciousness. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 14(1), 140–168.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Waking consciousness is associated with low [[amplitude]], irregular [[EEG]] activity in the 20–70&amp;nbsp;Hz range.
#* Conversely, unconscious states like deep sleep, [[coma]], [[general anesthesia]], and [[epilepsy|epileptic states]] of absence show a predominance of low [[frequency]], high-[[amplitude]] and more regular [[voltage]]s at less than 4Hz.
#Consciousness seems to be intrinsically associated with the thalamus and cortex, even if the extent to which this true is argued among scientists.
#* Damage to the [[brainstem]] or thalamus can abolish consciousness, while damage to the sensory cortex appears to delete specific conscious features such as [[color vision]], visual motion, conscious experiences of objects and faces, and the like.
#Consciousness is distinctively associated with widespread brain activation related to the conscious content.
#*Perhaps two dozen experiments show that sensory input supporting consciousness spreads from the [[sensory cortex]] to [[parietal lobe|parietal]], [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]], and [[temporal lobe|medial-temporal]] cortex, while closely matched input that does not reach consciousness activates mainly local sensory regions. Further, the widespread activity appears to involve more globally coordinated activity.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;

==Measurement==
To be fully comprehensive, measures of consciousness must not only define and distinguish between [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] states, but must also provide a guide by which the conscious level, or extent of consciousness, can be determined.&lt;ref name = Morin&gt;Morin, A. (2006). Levels of consciousness and self-awareness: A comparison and integration of various neurocognitive views. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 15(2), 358–371.&lt;/ref&gt; Measures of consciousness are each associated with particular theories.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures&gt;Seth, A. K. (2008). Theories and measures of consciousness develop together. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 17(3), 986–988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain defining theories are included below:

'''Worldly discrimination theory''' asserts that any mental state that is manifested in [[behavior]] is conscious; thus, an organism is consciously aware of something in the world if it can discriminate it with choice behavior.
'''Signal detection theory''' quantifies discriminability of a stimulus among a set of different stimuli.
'''Integration theories''' focus on finding a divide between conscious and unconscious processes. According to integration theories, conscious contents are widely available to many [[cognitive]] and/or neural processes.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures2&gt;Seth, A. K., Dienes, Z., Cleeremans, A., Overgaard, M., &amp; Pessoa, L. (2008). Measuring consciousness: relating behavioural and neurophysiological approaches. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', 12(8), 314–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories are then accompanied with measures of the level of consciousness, which are subdivided into [[behavioral]] measures and [[physiological]] measures.&lt;ref name = Morin/&gt;

===Behavioral measures===

Behavioral measures of primary consciousness can be either objective or subjective. Regarding objective measures, knowledge is unconscious if it expresses itself in an indirect test. For example, the ability to pick which item might come next in a series can indicate unconscious knowledge of regularities in sequences.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt;&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures2 /&gt; "Strategic control measures" use a person's ability to deliberately use or not use knowledge according to instructions. If they use information despite intentions not to use it, it indicates unconscious knowledge.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt; Post-decision wagering can also be used. In this method, subjects make a first-order discrimination (i.e. a choice) and then place a wager regarding the outcome of the discrimination. Some scientists view this as a direct and objective measure of consciousness, and it can be used with children and animals. However, this method has been argued to be subjective and indirect.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt;

===Physiological measures===

[[event-related potential|Event-related cortical potentials (ERPs)]] have been used to assess whether a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] is consciously perceived or not. These [[EEG]] measures either float free of theory, gaining credibility through reliable correlation, or assume a version of integration theory in which the appearance of a particular ERP indicates global availability or locally recurrent processing.&lt;ref name = Sethcomputation&gt;Seth, A. (2009). Explanatory Correlates of Consciousness: Theoretical and Computational Challenges. ''Cognitive Computation'', 1(1), 50–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abundant evidence indicates that consciously perceived inputs elicit widespread brain activation, as compared with inputs that do not reach consciousness.

The '''dynamic core hypothesis (DCH)''' proposes that consciousness arises from neural dynamics in the thalamocortical system, as measured by the quantity '''neural complexity (CN).''' ''CN'' is an information-theoretic measure; the ''CN'' value is high if each subset of a neural system can take on many different states, and if these states make a difference to the rest of the system.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;
The '''information integration theory of consciousness (IITC)''' shares with the DCH the idea that conscious experiences provide informative discriminations among a vast repertoire of possible experiences. In the IITC, the quantity ''phi'' is defined as the information that is integrated across the informational "weakest link" of a system. Importantly, ''phi'' is a measure of the capacity of a neural system to integrate information, whereas ''CN'' is a measure of the actual dynamics of the system. A third measure, '''causal density ''(CD)''''', measures the fraction of causal interactions among elements of a system that are statistically significant.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;

===Challenges in measuring===

It is important to note that subjective measures are always indirect and can be vulnerable to many biases (e.g., reluctance to report uncertain experiences). An|metacognitive]] conscious content assumes primary consciousness but not vice versa, subjective measures risk missing or rejecting the presence of sensory consciousness simply because metacognition isn't observed.&lt;ref name= Morin/&gt;

Furthermore, there is the problem of post-decision wagering, which has been criticized because there is a possibility that advantageous wagering could be learned unconsciously; as a result, post-decision wagering would not in fact be considered a conscious behavior. For example, individual differences in [[risk aversion]] may lead to variations in wagering performance even with the same underlying conscious phenomenology.&lt;ref name= Sethmeasures2/&gt;

Thus, although behavioral measures are mostly used for assessing which contents are conscious, some brain-based measures seem better suited for measuring conscious level. Objective measures also have their challenges, however. First, objective measures still require a response criterion, for example the decision of whether or not to push a button. Second, they may not even measure consciousness at all because many behavioral proxies, such as forced-choice decision accuracy, are capable of being learned unconsciously.&lt;ref name= Edelmansky/&gt;&lt;ref name = Edelman&gt;Edelman, G. (2001). Consciousness: the remembered present. ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', 929, 111–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous studies==

===In lucid dreams===

Hobson asserts that the existence of [[lucid dreaming]] means that the human brain can simultaneously occupy two states: waking and dreaming. The dreaming portion has experiences and therefore has primary consciousness, while the waking self recognizes the dreaming and can be seen as having a sort of [[secondary consciousness]] in the sense that there is an awareness of mental state. Studies have been able to show that lucid dreaming is associated with EEG power and coherence profiles that are significantly different from both non-lucid dreaming and waking.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt; Lucid dreaming situates itself between those two states. Lucid dreaming is characterized by more 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power than non-lucid dreaming, especially in frontal regions. Since it is 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power that has been correlated with waking consciousness in previous studies, it can be suggested that enough 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power has been added to the non-lucid dreaming brain to support the increase in subjective [[awareness]] that permits lucidity but not enough to cause full awakening.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt;

Dreaming is thus a [[virtual reality]] experience with a remarkably predictive simulation of external reality. Lucid dreamers may experience primary consciousness (the dream) and secondary consciousness (the waking) separately but simultaneously. Moreover, primary consciousness has recently been proposed by us to be characteristic of dreaming. It remains to be seen whether the enactment of dream behaviors uses the same brain processes as those that mediate those very behaviors in waking, and whether conscious within a dream is governed by the same processes.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt;

===In epileptic seizures===

Studies show that it is possible to retain primary consciousness and even [[secondary consciousness]] during [[complex partial seizure|complex partial epileptic seizures]]. One study analyzed 40 patients with complex partial seizures to determine their level of consciousness during seizures. The data acquired was based on patients' subjective descriptions of their experience and descriptions from family members who witnessed the seizures.&lt;ref name = Johanson/&gt; This study found there was a complete absence of consciousness in only 65% of people during the core period of the seizures. Meanwhile, 35% of seizures included some form of primary consciousness. Five seizure descriptions even reported some form of secondary consciousness, albeit short and intermittent. The level and contents of consciousness during epileptic seizures show considerable variability.&lt;ref name= Johanson/&gt;

===In thirst===

In one study, 10 adult males underwent [[positron emission tomography]] scans in three different scenarios:&lt;ref name=Denton&gt;Denton, D., Shade, R., Zamarippa, F., Egan, G., Blair-West, J., McKinley, M., et al. (1999). Neuroimaging of genesis and satiation of thirst and an interoceptor-driven theory of origins of primary consciousness. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', 96(9), 5304.&lt;/ref&gt;
# During generation of moderate thirst by infusion of [[intravenous]] [[hypertonic]] saline 0.51 M
# After wetting of the mouth with water to remove the sensation of dryness
# 3, 14, 45, and 60 minutes after drinking water to fully quench thirst

The data suggest that the anterior and posterior [[cingulate cortex]] as well as the anterior wall of the third [[ventricular system|ventricle]], are major elements of a circuit including [[thalamus|thalamic]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal]], [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]], [[insular cortex|insula]], and [[midbrain]] sites that are needed for the generation of consciousness of thirst.&lt;ref name = Denton/&gt;
This study shows that consciousness of some key sensations like thirst is governed by the oldest regions of the brain, which raises the question of whether it is really then possible to say when primary consciousness developed.&lt;ref name= Denton/&gt;

=== In meditation ===

In some types of meditation/yoga it is possible to have the experience known as Samadhi, where there is inner alertness but no object of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Patanjali's Yoga Sutras.&lt;/ref&gt; This mental state corresponds with specific physiological parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Travis, F. &amp; Pearsoon. C. (2000) Pure Consciousness: Distinct phenomenological and physiological correlates of "consciousness itself", ''International Journal of Neuroscience'', 100 pp. 77–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, the '''reach''' of a [[subset]] of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[real number]] that roughly describes how curved the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the set is.

== Definition ==
Let ''X'' be a subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then reach of ''X'' is defined as 

: &lt;math&gt;\text{reach}(X) := 
    \sup \{r \in \mathbb{R}: 
             \forall  x \in \mathbb{R}^n\setminus X\text{ with }{\rm dist}(x,X) &lt; r \text{ exists a unique closest point }y \in X\text{ such that }{\rm dist}(x,y)= {\rm dist}(x,X)\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
Shapes that have reach infinity include
* a single point,
* a straight line,
* a full square, and

The '''red-billed gull''' (''Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae scopulinus''), once also known as the '''mackerel gull''', is a native of [[New Zealand]], being found throughout the country and on outlying islands including the [[Chatham Islands]] and [[subantarctic]] islands. It was formerly considered as a separate species but is now usually treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[silver gull]] (''Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae'').&lt;ref name=ioc&gt;{{cite web| editor1-last=Gill | editor1-first=Frank | editor1-link=Frank Gill (ornithologist) | editor2-last=Donsker | editor2-first=David | year=2017 | title=Coursers, noddies, gulls, terns, auks &amp; sandgrouse | work=World Bird List Version 7.2 | url=http://www.worldbirdnames.org/bow/coursers/| publisher=International Ornithologists' Union | accessdate=21 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hbw&gt;{{cite book | last1=Burger | first1=J. | last2=Gochfeld | first2=M. | last3=Kirwan | first3=G.M. | last4=Garcia | first4=E.F.J. | chapter=Silver Gull (''Larus novaehollandiae'') | editor1-last=del Hoyo | editor1-first=J. | editor2-last=Elliott | editor2-first=A. | editor3-last=Sargatal | editor3-first=J. | editor4-last=Christie | editor4-first=D.A. | editor5-last=de Juana | editor5-first=E. | title=Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive | publisher=Lynx Edicions | chapterurl=http://www.hbw.com/node/53991 | accessdate=21 April 2017 | subscription=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Māori language|Māori]] name of this species is '''tarapunga''' or '''akiaki'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barrie Heather|author2=Hugh Robertson|last-author-amp=yes|title=The Field Guide to the Birds of New Zealand|edition=revised|publisher=Viking|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its vernacular name is sometimes also used for the [[dolphin gull]], a somewhat similar-looking but unrelated species. As is the case with many gulls, the red-billed gull has traditionally been placed in the [[genus]] ''[[Larus]]''.

==Description==
[[File:Chroicocephalus scopulinus -Picton, Marlborough, New Zealand -upper body-8.jpg|left|thumb|Upper body]]
The red-billed gull is a fairly small [[gull]] with an all-red bill, red eye ring, red legs and feet, pale grey wings with black wingtips. The rest of the body and tail are white. There is virtually no [[sexual dimorphism|visual difference between the male and female birds]]. Juvenile gulls have a dark brown bill with only hints of red, making them difficult to distinguish from the [[black-billed gull]]. The legs are also brown and there are brown spots on the grey wings.

==Distribution==
It is the smallest gull commonly seen in New Zealand; a recent estimate of the population puts it at half a million birds in the country. Until recently it was regarded as a [[subspecies]] of the [[silver gull]] found in [[Australia]], and the two species are very similar in appearance. However the most recent research suggests that they are not particularly closely related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shirihai, H.|year=2002|title=A complete guide to Antarctic wildlife|publisher= Alula Press, Oy, Finland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviour==
[[File:Red billed gull eating berries 02.jpg|thumb|left|Eating [[Coprosma repens|taupata]] berries]]
Behaviourally, the red-billed gull is a typical gull. It is an aggressive [[scavenger]] and [[kleptoparasitism|kleptoparasite]]. Since European settlement its numbers have increased, especially around coastal towns and cities where it can scavenge from urban waste. It normally feeds on small fish, shell fish and worms (from pastures), and sometimes berries, lizards and insects.

==Life cycle==
They nest from October to December in colonies on the coast, either on islands or rocky headlands, cliffs and beaches. The birds form [[pair bond]]s which endure across seasons, but there is a certain amount of [[extra-pair copulation]]. [[Courtship feeding]] is an important part of the preparation for mating. Nests are well formed and may be constructed of seaweed, grasses, leaves and ice plants. Generally two to three eggs are laid, their colour ranges from brown to grey with light and dark brown spots all over. The bird generally lives up to 12 years, although individuals have also been found living up to 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Ex-pat Kiwi returns from US to study red-billed seagulls|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/marlborough-express/news/kaikoura/3187352/Ex-pat-Kiwi-returns-from-US-to-study-red-billed-seagulls|newspaper = [[Stuff.co.nz]]|date = Dec 23, 2009|access-date = 2015-06-21|first = Emma|last = Dangerfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Resistance''', in the context of the field of [[psychoanalysis]], refers to oppositional behavior when an individual's unconscious defenses of the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] are threatened by an external source. [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of psychoanalytic theory, developed his concept of resistance as he worked with patients who suddenly developed uncooperative behaviors during sessions of [[talk therapy]]. He reasoned that an individual that is suffering from a psychological affliction, which Sigmund Freud believed to be derived from the presence of suppressed illicit or unwanted thoughts, may inadvertently attempt to impede any attempt to confront a subconsciously perceived threat. This would be for the purpose of inhibiting the revelation of any repressed information from within the [[unconscious mind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality Psychology: Domains of Knowledge About Human Nature|last=Larsen|first=Randy; Buss, David|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-110168-4|location=|pages=696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Having developed the theory of resistance through his direct experiences with patients undergoing therapy, Sigmund Freud noticed that patients would avoid subjects and topics that struck too closely to uncomfortable memories or unacceptable emotions and desires. Freud then integrated these findings with his previous theories concerning the functions of the [[id, ego and super-ego]]. As a result, he eventually advanced his concept of resistance by developing it into a multitude of individual forms that included repression, transference, ego-resistance, "working-through", and self-sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freudfile.org/psychoanalysis/resistance.html|title=Psychoanalysis - Resistances|website=www.freudfile.org|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common theory behind many of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic techniques, alluding to the fundamentals of psychoanalysis as a science, was that it is possible that memories that have been lost from consciousness provide hints of their existence by the means of prompting certain thoughts and behaviors.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ikonen|first=Pentti|last2=Absetz|first2=Kimmo|date=2002|title=The basic tools of psychoanalysis|url=|journal=The Scandinavian Psychoanalytic Review|volume=25|issue=1|pages=12–19|doi=10.1080/01062301.2002.10592721|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the aim of psychoanalysis is to bring what is unconscious or [[preconscious]] into consciousness through verbalization. Afterwards, the act of bringing such thoughts into consciousness prevents them from motivating behavior and thus allowing the individual to exert more personal control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernstein|first1=June|title=Consciousness and interpretation in modern psychoanalysis|journal=Modern Psychoanalysis|date=2009|volume=34|issue=1|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its history, resistance has caused significant division between psychologists. It remains a debated issue as there are some who considered it to be merely a description of a patient’s temperament rather than a universal construct of the human mind. Nonetheless, the concept of resistance retains a firm place in the history of psychology and the development of modern [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motivational Interviewing: Preparing People for Change, 2nd Edition|last=Miller, William R.|first=Stephen, Rollnick|publisher=Guilford Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1572305632|location=New York City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms of resistance ==

=== Repression ===
{{main article|Psychological repression}}

[[Psychological repression|Repression]] is the form of resistance where the ego pushes offensive memories, ideas, and impulses down into the unconscious. Essentially, the patient is unconsciously hiding memories from the conscious mind.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolman|first1=Benjamin|title=The Unconscious Mind: The Meaning of Freudian Psychology|date=1968|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-935767-1|page=182|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transference ===
{{main article|Transference}}

Typically unconscious, [[transference]] is when the patient allows past experiences to affect present relationships. In therapy, this may come about if the therapist reminds the patient, either consciously or unconsciously, of someone in their past who may have had an early impact on their life. Subsequently, the patient may suddenly tend to regard the therapist in either a positive or negative manner, depending upon the nature of the past influence.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=edited by Glen O. Gabbard, Bonnie E. Litowitz, Paul|title=Textbook of psychoanalysis|date=2012|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub.|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781585629794|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ego-resistance ===
This form of resistance is a neurotic regression to a proposed state of childlike safety. Usually, it involves the patient's attempts to gain attention and sympathy by emphasizing minor medical symptoms (i.e. headaches, nausea, and depression).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=1926|isbn=978-0393008746|location=New York City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working-through ===
{{main article|Working through}}
Derived from the id,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; this form of resistance reflects the unconscious desire for consistency in a manner that is based upon the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]. Since the id is an innate portion of human instinct, interpretation of the conscious is an insufficient method, thus the psychoanalyst must first be able to surmount resistances by the means of deduction of patients' unconscious defenses that are presented through exploitation of the mechanism of transference.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Self-sabotage ===
The weakest form of resistance that reflects the moralistic sentiments of the superego.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Essentially, it is a manifestation of internal guilt that prompts personal punishment by the means of self-imposed impediment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Applications ==
[[Psychoanalysis]] is, altogether, considered to be a type of insight-oriented therapeutic program. Despite general initial reservations, these types of programs have since transitioned from being quite marginal to becoming more well-known and mainstream.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrington|first=Anne|last2=Dunne|first2=John|date=2015|title=When mindfulness is therapy: ethical qualms, historical perspectives|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/25757884/97605608.pdf?sequence=1|journal=American Psychologist|volume=70|issue=7|pages=621–631|doi=10.1037/a0039460|pmid=26436312|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consideration to the theory of resistance itself, within a clinical setting, the expression of resistance is considered to be a significant stage to recovery because it reveals the presence of [[Psychological repression|repression]]. Additionally, it is indicative of progress in the effort of resolving any underlying issues that may be the cause of personal dysfunction. As resistance is theorized to be a manifestation of  the unconscious mind's attempts to protect the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]], it is the task of the psychoanalyst to combat this opposition by directing the patient to confront the unacceptable desires or uncomfortable memories. By this course of action, the patient may reach a [[Catharsis|cathartic]] conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality Psychology: Domains of Knowledge About Human Nature|last=Larsen|first=Randy; Buss, David|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-110168-4|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
{{See also|Psychoanalysis#Criticism|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
Psychologists remain divided with regard to the concept of resistance. Since Freud first developed his theory of resistance, he has been significantly criticized for using personally favorable and [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable methodology]]. For example, if a patient were to agree with a psychoanalyst's inference about themselves, it is a confirmation that there is something they are repressing. However, if the patient disagrees, it is also a sign they are engaged in repression, which means the psychoanalyst is correct in either scenario.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holowchak|first=Andrew|date=2012|title=The problem of unassailability: analogy and adequacy of constructions in freudian psychoanalysis|url=|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology|volume=29|issue=2|pages=255–266|doi=10.1037/a0020863|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many psychologists believe that the success of psychoanalysis is not due its various explanatory systems or its reasoning for repression, but rather simply due to the process of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud (Psychopathology of Everyday Life, the Interpretation of Dreams, and Three Contributions To the Theory of Sex)|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=Modern Library|year=1938|isbn=978-0679601661|location=New York City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Keith Dibble''' (born January 24, 1964) is an American former [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[pitcher]] and television analyst. Between 1988 and 1995, Dibble played for the [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. He was a two-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] who recorded 89 [[Save (baseball)|saves]] during his career. Since retiring as a player, Dibble has held several roles in sports television broadcasting.

==Personal life==
Dibble was born in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. He attended St. Thomas School, a [[parochial school]], and is a graduate of [[Southington High School]] in [[Southington, Connecticut]].  Dibble's father, Walt Dibble, was a longtime radio news director at [[WDRC-FM|WDRC]] and later [[WTIC (AM)|WTIC]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].

==Playing career==

===Cincinnati Reds===
Dibble was drafted by the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in the first round of the 1983 amateur draft, and he made his debut with the Reds on June 29, 1988.

On June 4, 1989, Dibble struck out three batters on nine pitches in the eighth inning of a 5–3 win over the [[San Diego Padres]]. Dibble is one of 41 pitchers in Major League history to accomplish the [[Pitchers who struck out three batters on nine pitches|nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning]], a feat known as an immaculate inning.

He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]] in [[1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1990]] and [[1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1991]], and was the [[1990 National League Championship Series|1990 NLCS]] [[Most Valuable Player]] (along with fellow "[[Nasty Boys (Cincinnati Reds)|Nasty Boy]]" [[Randy Myers]]). In 1990, Dibble and the [[1990 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won the [[1990 World Series|World Series]] by beating the [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in four consecutive games.

Dibble recorded his 500th career strikeout in fewer innings—368—than any other pitcher in modern baseball history up to that point (a record that is currently held by [[Craig Kimbrel]]).

====Temper====
During his career Dibble was known for his temper. During a game in July 1989, he hit [[1989 New York Mets season|Mets]] second basemen [[Tim Teufel]] in the back with a pitch; Teufel then [[charging the mound|charged]] Dibble, causing a benches clearing brawl. After saving a game in April 1991 despite giving up two runs in relief, Dibble threw a baseball 400 feet into the center-field seats at Cincinnati, inadvertently striking a woman.&lt;ref name=4May1991port&gt;{{cite news|title=National League suspends Dibble for 4 games for firing ball into stands|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hkRGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=P9EMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2876,369254|accessdate=19 April 2011|newspaper=[[Portsmouth Daily Times]]|date=4 May 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt4May1991&gt;{{cite news|title=A New Suspension for Reds' Dibble|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/04/sports/baseball-a-new-suspension-for-reds-dibble.html|accessdate=19 April 2011|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=4 May 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truebaseballstories"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shannon|first=Mike|title=Tales from the Dugout: The Greatest True Baseball Stories Ever Told|year=1998|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-8092-2950-1|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y17fnEHFIcsC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=rob+dibble+temper&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jtWuseI7dN&amp;sig=FKTLECwOrf_nNGQC6vsZHQHIUv4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=p0T4S7-TLoKdlgedntnECg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rob%20dibble%20temper&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved in a brawl in 1991 with [[1991 Houston Astros season|Astros]] shortstop [[Eric Yelding]].&lt;ref name=nyt4May1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name="spartanburg"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dibble, Yielding suspended|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19910418&amp;id=OuoeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NM4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5474,749743|accessdate=22 May 2010|newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal|date=April 18, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 1991 season, he threw a baseball into the back of [[1991 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] outfielder [[Doug Dascenzo]] as he ran down the first base line and was subsequently ejected from the game.&lt;ref name="nytimes_july261991"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vescey|first=Peter|title=Sports of The Times; Rob Dibble: The Pitcher Most Likely|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-rob-dibble-the-pitcher-most-likely.html|accessdate=22 May 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 26, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dibble also was involved in a brawl with manager [[Lou Piniella]] in the Reds clubhouse after a game in 1992.&lt;ref name="la_times1992"&gt;{{cite news|title=Piniella, Dibble Brawl in Clubhouse|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-18/sports/sp-723_1_major-league|accessdate=22 May 2010|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 18, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Dibble required surgery to his pitching arm in 1994, and missed the entire season as a result.

==Broadcasting career==
[[File:Rob Dibble 2009.jpg|thumb|Dibble with the Nationals in 2009.]]
In 1998, Dibble joined [[ESPN]] as a [[baseball]] analyst, working mostly on [[Dan Patrick]]'s radio show. He worked on ''[[The Best Damn Sports Show Period]]'' as a co-host until 2008, when he left to join FOX on their Saturday baseball program as an analyst. Dibble also spends time as a co-host/analyst of First Pitch on [[XM]] Channel 175/Sirius channel 210. He formerly hosted ''The Show'' (on the same channel) with [[Jody McDonald]]. Dibble served as co-analyst (with [[Kevin Kennedy (baseball)|Kevin Kennedy]]) for [[FOXSports.com]] on a weekly video segment entitled "Around the Bases." Dibble also is a co-host with former Major League player [[Denny Hocking]] on Fox Sports Radio Sunday night programming. In 2009, Dibble signed a three-year contract to replace [[Don Sutton]] as the color voice of the [[Washington Nationals]] on [[MASN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/06/on-masn-dibble-wont-be-so-nasty/ Dibble not so 'nasty'].

While broadcasting a game in August 2010, Dibble drew negative attention for focusing on a group of female spectators in the Nationals crowd, and questioning their focus on the game.&lt;ref name="washpostWomen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Dan|title=Rob Dibble amazed by women at baseball game |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/dcsportsbog/2010/08/rob_dibble_amazed_by_women_at.html|work=D.C.

'''Sandra Cabrera''' (27 October 1970 – 27 January 2004) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] street-based sex worker, trade unionist, and campaigner for sex worker rights. She was killed in 2004 when her anti-corruption efforts started being successful and threatened police corruption networks and her defense of street workers' rights threatened brothel owners.

Her first contact with [[Association of Women Sex Workers in Argentina in Action for Our Rights|AMMAR]] (Association of Women Prostitutes of Argentina) occurred in 2000, but she didn't begin working with the union until 2001.

{{ quote | text= I was working in a corner of the Terminal area and a group of pimps and bouncers from a bar in the area beat me up pretty badly.

During Argentina's economic crisis in 2001, Cabrera discovered the power of  union association. She complained publicly that the lack of cash had left the women on the street desperately poor, to the point of not knowing if they would have food for their families on Christmas. The Ministry of Social Advancement gave the union sacks of food that Cabrera distributed,&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; working from 8 in the morning to 10 at night.

{{ quote | text= "There were many women who had nothing to eat, so we started to manage food boxes and work plans... At 10:30 pm my daughter and I fell asleep and when I woke up the other day I worried because we had not celebrated Christmas, but she (her daughter Macarena, 7 years old) told me not to worry about it, because thanks to what we had done the day before, many of our companions had something to celebrate.
| author= Sandra Cabrera&lt;ref name="luchadora"/&gt; 
}}

Cabrera seems to have been a devoted mother to the daughter she called "Maca". She encouraged her education and ensured that she learned computer skills. She took her to the theater. At the time of the murder, Macarena was away at a scouting camp in Mendoza.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

Cabrera's work to stop the spread of [[AIDS]] and other STDs began in October, 2001.

{{ quote | text= The word of someone unknown is not the same as one of us talking to our colleagues, with our language, explaining how to take care of ourselves through our experience.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

Lacking resources for its own place, AMMAR's Rosario chapter maintained an office with the Government Workers Association, where the AMMAR women were known affectionately as "the Sanjua gang", after Cabrera's place of origin.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Cabrera reportedly had a love/hate relationship with AMMAR's national leadership. Her interactions with Elena Reynaga, Secretary General of the union at the time, have been described as "explosive".&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Reynaga acknowledged that no one she worked with fought her as Cabrera did,

but she also acknowledged Cabrera's effectiveness:

{{ quote 
| text= She cared about the others, the injustices spurred her on, she got what she wanted.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

}}

Organizing gave her a position in a social network that she couldn't get any other way.

{{ quote 
| text= She was very lacking in [i.e. hadn't received] affection, like so many of us. In the organization she began to find something we all seek, to be recognized for something and to be important.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

}}

And in Rosario, she found that recognition.

| text= We admire her strength, how she achieves things for us. It makes us think that if we unite we can aspire to a retirement, to a more dignified life.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

She was the consummate union organizer. For two years before her murder, she used her motorcycle to take her every place in [[Rosario]] where her colleagues were working the street, listening to their complaints and planning how to use the union to protect them.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; After she died this was how many people remembered her; on her bike, distributing condoms, asking about people's problems.&lt;ref name="frente"/&gt; She learned how to make statements to the news media that the media would pick up and publish, spreading her message.

}}

Perhaps Cabrera's hardest task was just persuading her colleagues that a union was possible. Claudia Lucero, her close friend, sometime dancing partner, godmother of her daughter, and eventual successor as secretary general of the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] chapter of AMMAR, had to be won over.

{{ quote 
| text= When she proposed it, I did not want to know anything. I told her it was crazy, that it could not be that we had a union, because we had never had anything. Society always had us as the lowest, for me it was like we did not exist. When the crisis came in late 2001, Sandra got social plans. There I started to go to the headquarters of the Central of Argentine Workers (CTA), but still thought that we could not get to where we arrived today. When I started to go, I met all the union guys who treated us differently, they said 'how are you, girls.' There I began to realize that we were not what they had made us believe. Because we suffered so much repression, the police made us believe that we were nobody. There I realized that it was not so.&lt;ref name="frente"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero
}}

Other street workers had other reasons for not joining. Stella Maris Longoni found it easier just to pay her police extortionist fifty pesos a week and be left in peace, until the day she paid and the police arrested her anyway. Released from jail, with police warnings not to join the union still ringing in her ears, she went straight to Cabrera and AMMAR.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

| author= testimony of Rosa Maria Teresa Signorelli }}
During Sandra Cabrera's murder investigation, a source inside the investigation told a news reporter that Cabrera had been defending herself on three fronts: the violence and risk of working on the street, the assaults arranged by the brothel businesses she and her independent street colleagues were competing with, and the harassment and threats from the police whose graft networks she was disrupting.&lt;ref name="olor"/&gt; The corrupt connection between the brothel owners and the police meant that Cabrera's struggle to protect street workers was necessarily a struggle against corruption.

By way of background, the journalist Carlos del Frade has described a meeting in 1991 between Rodolfo Enrique Riegé, Secretary of Public Security for the province of Santa Fe, and Atilio Bléfari, head of police in Rosario. Riegé informed Bléfari that if he didn't increase the graft revenues that he was paying to Riegé, Riegé would relieve him of command and force him to retire. The resulting struggle for control of the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] was not a struggle between justice and corruption, but a struggle between a corrupt police officer and his even more corrupt superior. The document that del Frade cites as a source goes on to list the sources of extralegal income the police were collecting, which included theft of goods during transport, bank robbery, car theft, gambling, exploitation of juveniles in nightclubs and discos, and medical quackery, among other things. Category number two was income from the Public Morality units of the police, and included
{{ quote
| text= drug traffickers, drug addicts, prostitutes, exploiters, pimps, nightclubs, discos, motels }}
Since the nightclubs and discos were fronts for brothels, this can be summarized as drugs and prostitution.

As part of her campaign for sex worker rights, Cabrera fought for the elimination of the articles of the provincial Misdemeanor Code that criminalized prostitution.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Different officers in Rosario's Public Morality unit were able to use the Code to play different sides. Some officers were paid by the brothel owners to enforce the Code against the street workers who were competing with the brothels. Other officers collected bribes from street workers for not enforcing the Code.

Another complication was her romantic involvement with an officer of the Federal police, Diego Parvlucyk. She acted as an informant and he gave her drugs that had been seized during police operations, which she sold. Initially her connection with the Federal police seemed to give her some protection from the provincial police, or at least a feeling of protection, but the relationship with Parvlucyk became more difficult and he was later arrested for her murder, although released and never tried.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; For many of Argentina's sex workers, this relationship didn't seem unusual.

From 1999 to 2002, there is record of ten formal complaints made by Cabrera against the police. Most of them involve harassment or threats against her or a colleague.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

On March 4, 2003, Marcela Patricia Morelli, a street sex worker and member of AMMAR, filed a complaint against officers of the Ludueña neighborhood police station. She and two trans sex workers had been detained by the officers in what she felt was an excessive manner and with "a humiliating treatment". One of the trans sex workers was released after two hours, but Morelli and the other remained for more than six hours. The police removed money and clothing from the other trans sex worker, humiliated the person, and left the person lying on the floor, naked. In the morning the station chief arrived and told them that he didn't want "male or female prostitutes" in his jurisdiction, and threatened more violent measures. He threatened to drag Morelli by her hair if he saw her again.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

As leader of AMMAR's Rosario chapter, Cabrera made the following statements.

{{ quote
| text= We are asking for security. We are fed up with being presented to the merchants of the neighborhoods as sources of insecurity, when many times the presence of prostitutes has avoided robberies.

We know that we are at fault and do not refuse to be delayed by the police in routine checks, but most of us have school-age children and we have already talked to government ministry personnel so we will not be detained in days during the school year, in order to send our children to school.

These things are repeated every time there are changes of leadership in the sections. When we are stopped we do not refuse to show the latest test results for HIV, despite the fact that the National AIDS Act, 23,798, guarantees the confidentiality of those results.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt; 
| author= Sandra Cabrera}}

On September 10, 2003, Cabrera organized a formal complaint against the chief and deputy chief of the Public Morality unit of the police, accusing them of harassing sex workers at the stops near the Rosario Bus Terminal in order to protect brothels in the area from competition from independent street workers. An investigation turned up evidence that they were providing protection for a brothel whose women included underage girls and women trafficked from the Dominican Republic. The complaint also accused police officers of forcing street-based sex workers to pay bribes in order to work. The chief and deputy chief were removed, and the new head of the Public Morality section was a woman, nominally chosen to ensure that the corrupt practices ended,&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; but perhaps in reality chosen to take the pressure off without actually changing anything.&lt;ref name="olor"/&gt; Not quite five months later, when Cabrera was murdered, the disgraced ex-chief of Public Morality had been reassigned as head of the Zavalla police station.

Following the complaint, some of the bars the two police chiefs had been protecting closed, and a few others stopped making payments to the police. One of the sex workers who joined Cabrera in the complaint testified during the murder investigation that Cabrera had expressed fear that the police would retaliate.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt; 

On October 9, someone called the headquarters of the Government Workers Association, where AMMAR kept an office, and said "Tell Sandra that the girl will die before tomorrow." The girl was Cabrera's eight year old daughter, Macarena. From then until shortly before Cabrera's murder, the police Personal Security unit kept a nightly guard on her home.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

A few days later, an anonymous complaint filed in the juvenile courts claimed that "Sandra sent the girl to beg and did not go to school." A social worker investigated and confirmed that Macarena had, in fact, been going to school.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

On October 17 a sex worker was assaulted by a cyclist who struck her strongly in the head with a chain. The women went to the police and together they searched the area, but her assailant was never found.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

At some point, while the police guard was temporarily away from Cabrera's home, someone got in and beat her.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; At another point, two men got into her home, put a gun to the head of her dog, and told her to stop fucking with them.&lt;ref name="aUnAno"/&gt;

The last complaint Cabrera helped file, four days before her murder, involved an officer who charged a woman fifty pesos a week for the privilege of working without trouble from the police. In spite of punctual payments, the woman was arrested by the Public Morality police, who informed her that the officer she was paying was no longer working in that division. When she announced that she was going to join AMMAR, the Morality police threatened her with daily arrests. Cabrera went with her to file an extortion complaint and was with her when she spoke to the news media. Cabrera told a reporter that she was afraid that someone from the Public Morality unit would come back for her.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

During her murder investigation, the investigating judge found evidence of fifteen death threats against her.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;

=== Evidence ===
Testimony indicates that Sandra Cabrera was standing at her usual corner with a colleague at around 4:30 on the morning of 27 January 2004. She was approached by a client and walked toward him, away from her colleague. The colleague never saw the man's face and didn't recognize him. From behind, he appeared to be tall and thin, in light shorts. Cabrera and the client left together to go to her home.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

She was found dead from a shot in the back of the neck.&lt;ref name=nswp/&gt; The investigation determined that the muzzle of the gun had been pushed against her neck and the gun was partially supported by her skull when it was fired.

Her body was two blocks from the Omnibus Terminal,&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; one block from the stop where she worked.

There were no scuff marks on her sandals or clothes, indicating that she had not been dragged, but had been killed where she was found.&lt;ref name="zorro"/&gt; The bullet that killed her has been sometimes reported to be a 9 mm,&lt;ref name=nswp/&gt; but news reports at the time of the investigation said the investigators found a .32 caliber slug.&lt;ref name="zorro"/&gt; (Various police departments in Argentina have issued 9 mm handguns to their officers ([[Bersa Thunder 9]]), but the .32 caliber bullet is considered too small for police work.)

Her pants were pulled down below her hips but her underpants were in their normal position. A condom wrapper was found next to her body.&lt;ref name="olor"/&gt;
The police lab found semen in her vaginal and anal cavities.&lt;ref name="marcha"/&gt; Testimony indicated that she had had sex with her lover a couple of hours before she was last seen alive.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

Analysis by forensic experts suggests a planned assassination, not a spur-of-the-moment crime of passion. Her killer was probably either familiar with the area, or had cased it ahead of time, and led her to the entry of a private house where they were less likely to be observed. The murder weapon was a small caliber handgun that was easier to hide than the larger handguns issued by police departments. The killer apparently knew how to use a smaller weapon to ensure that Cabrera was killed by one shot, without the need for a second. The forensic analysts believe that he stood behind her, held her head with his left hand, forced the muzzle of the gun against her neck, and fired while standing with his knees slightly flexed. She died instantly.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

The forensic report concluded:

{{ quote
| text= The possibility is raised of a killer who has chosen circumstances of time and place, has killed at the right moment of least resistance of the victim, has held the corpse so that it does not strike with suddenness when falling and has left without leaving evidence of his presence. The hypothesis speaks of a professional profile of the victimizer with knowledge in the area, the habits of the victim and the task to be performed. Likewise the neatness of their movements must be considered. This consideration offers the probable alternative that the assailant knew the victim during a previous encounter provoked precisely to obtain data of habits and circumstances in which the victim moved.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt; }}

=== Reaction ===
Her murder was a shock to the national political system. Almost immediately the national Minister of Justice got in touch with the [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] governor, and the Secretary for National Human Rights came to [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] to get involved in the case. Within two days the investigating judge had convened a multi-disciplinary meeting at the Institute of Forensic Medicine with ten forensic experts; an extraordinary step in any murder case, much less a case involving a street-based sex worker.

The investigating judge laid out three lines of investigation: she was killed by a client, she was killed by the brothel owners, or she was killed by the police.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; At the time, there were no reports of clients committing crimes against prostitutes. Sources in the police department reported that the police were seriously looking into the possibility that she had been killed by someone hired by the brothel owners. Her first encounter with AMMAR occurred when she complained to the media about being assaulted by pimps and bouncers,&lt;ref name="luchadora"/&gt; i.e. by men associated with a bar that was a front for a brothel. The two chiefs of the Public Morality unit who were removed after her complaint were being paid by brothel owners to drive off street sex workers.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Her struggle against the brothel owners went back many years.

Everyone else assumed it was the police. The police in [[Argentina]] have a history of killing reformers and killing sex workers. A few years earlier, investigators in [[Mar del Plata]] had uncovered a police conspiracy to use a fictional serial killer to cover up the murder of thirty two sex workers,

The [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] police killed the social activist [[Pocho Lepratti | Claudio Lepratti]] during the disturbances of 2001 when he tried to warn them off from firing at a school where children were eating lunch. At Cabrera's funeral procession, the AMMAR members shouted "We know, we know, that our colleague was killed by the police."&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

Among political insiders and unionists there were two theories about the police. The first was that they killed Cabrera to silence her. The second was that they killed her to warn the new provincial government in [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] to stop interfering with the graft. Changes of administrations in [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]] had typically been accompanied by some sort of organized criminal action by the police, just to remind everybody of the rules of the game.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt; Carlos del Frade relates that during [[Jorge Obeid | Obeid]]'s first administration as governor of [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]], he removed a half dozen police officers who had been involved in state sponsored torture and terrorism. The police responded with a message that if he removed any more police officers, it would break the institutional peace in the province.&lt;ref name="matar"/&gt;

The previous administration had responded to Cabrera's complaints by removing high ranking officers for corruption, and the new administration was arresting street level officers for extortion. This second theory implies that Cabrera's killers just wanted to warn off the government from the dangerous experiment of punishing police officers for corruption.&lt;ref name="niUnaMas"/&gt;

To show its resolve in moving the case forward, the provincial government quickly appointed a committee of five police officers to investigate. The committee was under the direct orders of José Manuel Maldonado, head of Regional Unit II of the provincial police; in effect, chief of police for the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]]. Previously, as head of the Judicial Police, he had been accused of shielding officers involved with the killing of [[Pocho Lepratti | Claudio Lepratti]] and protecting 1st Precinct policemen accused of raping a sixteen year old girl. According to the assistant secretary of the [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]] (the union federation AMMAR belongs to), Maldonado ensured that proceeds from the payments extorted from sex workers and the money that pimps paid for protection were distributed to officers and politicians appropriately. The unit he currently headed had been linked three years previously to extra-judicial executions and deaths in custody. So he was head of a police unit accused of exactly the type of assassination people were accusing the police of in the Cabrera case, he was believed to be responsible for administering the graft that she had been campaigning against, and he appeared to be experienced in covering up police crimes. The [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]] and the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] association of prosecutors demanded his removal.&lt;ref name="zorro"/&gt;

After several months of investigation, the investigating judge ordered the detention of Parvlucyk, the Federal police officer Cabrera had been involved with, and charged him with murder.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; In addition to their troubled relationship, Parvlucyk had stated in his testimony that his immediate superior had asked him to silence Cabrera, and his superior has stated that Parvlucyk always complied with orders.
&lt;ref name="estructural"&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On appeal, the judge's decision was overturned, and neither Parvlucyk nor anyone else has been tried for Cabrera's murder.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; The panel of judges that overturned the decision of the investigating judge referred to some of the witnesses as ""people with street activities who pass their mornings with a wandering itinerary".&lt;ref name="miedo"/&gt; One of the appeals judges discredited the testimony of over twenty street-based sex workers because they were women who "have an activity that can not be described as good morals," according to the journalist Carlos Del Frade.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt; He claims that the possibility that Parvlucyk killed Cabrera because he was ordered to silence her was never properly investigated. Del Frade also claims that the link between Cabrera's murder and the structural corruption in the provincial and Federal police organizations was never investigated.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;

Among the members of AMMAR's [[Rosario, Argentina | Rosario]] chapter, the reaction to Cabrera's murder was a mixture of fear and bravado. "If AMMAR dies, we fatten the pigs," they told each other, and "She paid for everything, and that's why the fight continues."&lt;ref name="explotadores"/&gt; But when Cabrera's friend Claudia Lucero took over as general secretary of the chapter, she found it sometimes difficult to reach out to her colleagues. They warned her, "Don't get involved, you'll end up like Sandra."&lt;ref name="miedo"/&gt; A lawyer who worked for [[Argentine Workers' Central Union | CTA]], the trade union federation that AMMAR is part of, and who represented AMMAR during the murder investigation, said that some of the women who might have testified refused to get involved in the case, and others left [[Santa Fe province]] out of fear.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt; Four years later, Lucero reported similar fear among the street workers.

{{ quote
| text= Fear is present. When I tell you, let's get together, come, they're afraid. I can not tell them we are going to a march or when we are going to do some research work as well. To myself they say "How do you keep going"?&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero}}

As for Macarena Cabrera, Sandra's daughter, one can only imagine her reaction to it all. Growing up she had access to the Internet and knew about the failure of the murder investigation and the various theories people proposed. Nine years after the murder she went to the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] branch of the Government Workers Association, the union that had provided AMMAR Rosario with office space and where her mother had been well known, and told them she really wanted to know what happened to her mother. They were probably able to give her a lot of information, but the source for this says that actual explanations were in short supply.&lt;ref name="impunidad"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
=== Influence ===
==== Public Morality police unit ====
If the police were, in fact, trying to send a message to the new provincial administration, it backfired. Cabrera's murder gave the government the political cover it needed to eliminate the Public Morality section of the provincial police. High on the list of her legacies is the fact that two days after her murder, the Santa Fe Minister of Government announced that the Public Morality section would be dissolved and the officers that served in it would be distributed among different units. He said that the move had been under consideration since the beginning of the new administration:

{{ quote
| text= ... because it is an obsolete unit that allows a certain degree of corruption, without passing judgment on the officers that served in it.
| author= Alberto Gianneschi, Minister of Government in Santa Fe province at the time of Sandra Cabrera's murder

But he acknowledged that he was making the announcement in the context of Cabrera's murder.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Misdemeanor Code ====
On the other hand, the government wanted to amend, rather than repeal, the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized sex work and transgenderism. The political opposition favored straight repeal, but the government was concerned about voter reaction and opposition from the Church.&lt;ref name="explotadores"/&gt; As the Minister of Government put it with Victorian sensibility:

{{ quote
| text= We are looking for a balance between the claims of the defense of modesty and scandalous prostitution through a new bill.
| author= Alberto Gianneschi&lt;ref name="noticia"/&gt;
}}

As the new secretary general of AMMAR's [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] chapter, Claudia Lucero continued the campaign to repeal the articles.

{{ quote
| text= "The contravention codes are not repealed. The situation is the same, the only thing that changed is that there is no more Public Morality, but there are the precincts, there is the command [police unit], the police are still chasing us. After Sandra's death, a month later, we had a partner in Baigorria who was threatened and beaten. The harassment continues, the mobile units stop us, some police come and say 'you have to go because the neighbor says' and that is a lie. They make it up so that the sex worker gives them money and they let her work. The commands are in the red zone and that's because the codes are not repealed and the police still have power.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero }}

For AMMAR [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], the campaign was an important rallying point. The constant police harassment intimidated the women in the street, but it also gave them strong motivation to take steps, however risky, to join the campaign against laws that legitimized the harassment. And since the campaign had been Cabrera's initiative, it gave the union frequent opportunity to invoke the name of Sandra Cabrera, who had become an important symbol for sex workers' rights.

{{ quote
| text= I said when Sandra passed, let's try to continue because otherwise everything is dying. And that is the commitment and at the same time persuades me that the death of Sandra was not in vain, beyond that we do not have justice. But it was not in vain, because we followed the path she left us. The day that the codes are repealed will not be our achievement, that's the way Sandra prepared us, so the achievement will be hers.&lt;ref name="estructural"/&gt;
| author= Claudia Lucero }}

Finally, in 2010, after years of lobbying and activism by AMMAR [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], a different administration repealed the articles of the law that Cabrera had campaigned against.
&lt;ref name="despenalizo"&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While she didn't live to see the victory, she was part of the fight, and it was a more fundamental restructuring of society's relationship with sex work than eliminating a police unit.

==== Rosario ====
Walter Miranda, who had been removed as chief of the Public Morality unit following Cabrera's complaint because he had been providing protection to brothels that trafficked underage girls and foreign women, as well as extorting bribes from street-based sex workers, continued to advance through the ranks. By 2012 he had become head of Regional Unit II, which gave him control of all provincial police forces in the city of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]]. The brothels in the area around the bus terminal that he had been protecting were still there. During an investigation of trafficking in humans, a phone tap of one of the brothel owners recorded the owner asking how to go about selling cocaine. The answer was that he should bribe Hugo Tognoli, the highest ranking police officer in the province of [[Santa Fe province | Santa Fe]]. Laura Cosido, a judge in the Federal Chamber of Rosario, stated that "There was never such an open relationship between narcos and police." AMMAR, Cabrera's union, complained that the drug and human trafficking networks were the same.

Around the same time, Claudia Lucero was complaining that in spite of the revocation of the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized street prostitution, the police were still finding ways to extort money from street workers.

Shortly thereafter, sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] went through the same change in law and enforcement that the rest of Argentina experienced. The anti-trafficking law, passed a few years earlier, began to be enforced consistently, ending the legal regulation of brothels by municipalities. One of the last cabarets in Rosario was closed when city inspectors found an entertainer performing oral sex on a customer. Announcing that they were closing the place, the inspectors were attacked by the madame and the female employees, who threw glasses and punched and kicked the inspectors. Driven into the street, they took refuge in a local bar where the women found them and again attacked, throwing and breaking tables and stealing the tape used to officially seal a closed business. Not everyone in Argentina embraced the new anti-trafficking regime.

Some of the women who had worked in the cabarets and ''whiskerías'' that fronted for brothels moved to private apartments operated by the same type of people who had operated the brothels.

The motels that once rented to independent sex workers now turn them away in order to avoid problems with the city. In response, some of the women have organized ''casitas'', where a group of women rent a house and set aside a part of the earnings from each client session to cover the rent. Basically, women who were previously working in brothels are still working in brothels, and women who were previously independent are still independent. Georgina Orellano, secretary general of AMMAR as of 2017, says of the new legal regime that "It took all the activity to a much darker and hidden place."&lt;ref name="sombra"/&gt;

For the street based workers, Orellano says that since Mauricio Macri became Argentina's president, institutional violence has increased in public spaces.

| author= Georgina Orellano
}}

Orellano says that the new prohibitionist regime recognizes only victims and pimps, and criminalizes women who enter sex work voluntarily. The current municipal law on sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], passed in 2013, mentions assistance and support; Orellano says that the city department responsible for implementing the assistance has helped so few women that they can be counted on the fingers of the two hands. AMMAR's last survey found one hundred women working the streets in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], and it is estimated that another six hundred are working indoors.&lt;ref name="sombra"/&gt;

The legal and police system that Sandra Cabrera struggled with has changed. Where it once tolerated brothels it has become prohibitionist. The laws that once referred to street based sex work as "scandalous" and an "offense to modesty"&lt;ref name="proyecto"/&gt; now speak of assisting sex workers. The owners of regulated brothels who once assaulted independent sex workers in the streets, or paid the police to do the same, now operate illegally in private apartments, driven underground by the prohibitionist movement that currently opposes AMMAR in the media and the legislatures. The political projects of Cabrera and AMMAR's founders have been challenged by new social forces with different concepts of sex worker rights and agency. And yet street based sex workers face the same problems, including police violence and extortion. Perhaps Cabrera's most important legacy is illustrated by a little story told by Claudia Lucero a year after Cabrera's death:

{{ quote
| text= A short while ago the Command [Radio Command, a police unit] wanted to take bribes from a member [of AMMAR], and it turns out that she is unionized. She told them to take her prisoner, but she would call her lawyer as soon as she got to the police station because she had that right. The cops wanted to arrange something, give them money, or go to jail. But when she told them that, they dropped her at a corner and left.&lt;ref name="frente"/&gt;

=== Recognition ===
Nine days after Cabrera's murder, marches were held in [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]], [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Salta province]], demanding justice and sex workers rights. The counts of participants weren't given for the marches, but the [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] march was described as "multitudinous" and included a cross section of [[Rosario, Santa Fe | Rosario]] civic society, including leaders of political parties, unions, and human rights groups.

'''Tarski's axioms''', due to [[Alfred Tarski]], are an [[axiom]] set for the substantial fragment of [[Euclidean geometry]] that is formulable in [[first-order logic]] with [[identity (mathematics)|identity]], and requiring no [[set theory]] {{harv|Tarski|1959}} (i.e., that part of Euclidean geometry that is formulable as an [[elementary theory]]). Other modern axiomizations of Euclidean geometry are [[Hilbert's axioms]] and [[Birkhoff's axioms]].

==Overview==
Early in his career Tarski taught geometry and researched set theory. His coworker Steven Givant (1999) explained Tarski's take-off point:
:From Enriques, Tarski learned of the work of [[Mario Pieri]], an Italian geometer who was strongly influenced by Peano. Tarski preferred Pieri's system [of his ''Point and Sphere'' memoir], where the logical structure and the complexity of the axioms were more transparent.
Givant then says that "with typical thoroughness" Tarski devised his system:
:What was different about Tarski's approach to geometry? First of all, the axiom system was much simpler than any of the axiom systems that existed up to that time. In fact the length of all of Tarski's axioms together is not much more than just one of Pieri's 24 axioms. It was the first system of Euclidean geometry that was simple enough for all axioms to be expressed in terms of the [[primitive notion]]s only, without the help of defined notions. Of even greater importance, for the first time a clear distinction was made between full geometry and its elementary — that is, its first order — part.

Like other modern axiomatizations of Euclidean geometry, Tarski's employs a [[formal system]] consisting of symbol strings, called [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]s, whose construction respects formal [[syntax (logic)|syntactical rules]], and rules of proof that determine the allowed manipulations of the sentences. Unlike some other modern axiomatizations, such as [[Birkhoff's axioms|Birkhoff's]] and [[Hilbert's axioms|Hilbert's]], Tarski's axiomatization has no [[primitive object]]s other than ''points'', so a variable or constant cannot refer to a line or an angle. Because points are the only primitive objects, and because Tarski's system is a [[first-order theory]], it is not even possible to define lines as sets of points. The only primitive relations ([[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s) are "betweenness" and "congruence" among points.

Tarski's axiomatization is shorter than its rivals, in a sense Tarski and Givant (1999) make explicit. It is more concise than Pieri's because Pieri had only two primitive notions while Tarski introduced three: point, betweenness, and congruence. Such economy of primitive and defined notions means that Tarski's system is not very convenient for ''doing'' Euclidean geometry. Rather, Tarski designed his system to facilitate its analysis via the tools of [[mathematical logic]], i.e., to facilitate deriving its metamathematical properties. Tarski's system has the unusual property that all sentences can be written in universal-existential form, a special case of the [[prenex normal form]]. This form has all [[Universal quantification|universal quantifiers]] preceding any [[Existential quantification|existential quantifiers]], so that all sentences can be recast in the form &lt;math&gt;\forall u \forall v \ldots\exists a \exists b\dots.&lt;/math&gt; This fact allowed Tarski to prove that Euclidean geometry is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]: there exists an [[algorithm]] which can determine the truth or falsity of any sentence. Tarski's axiomatization is also [[Completeness (logic)|complete]]. This does not contradict [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]], because Tarski's theory lacks the expressive power needed to interpret [[Robinson arithmetic]] {{harv|Franzén|2005|pp=25–26}}.

== The axioms ==

[[Alfred Tarski]] worked on the axiomatization and metamathematics of [[Euclidean geometry]] intermittently from 1926 until his death in 1983, with Tarski (1959) heralding his mature interest in the subject. The work of Tarski and his students on Euclidean geometry culminated in the monograph Schwabhäuser, Szmielew, and Tarski (1983), which set out the 10 [[axiom]]s and one [[axiom schema]] shown below, the associated [[metamathematics]], and a fair bit of the subject. Gupta (1965) made important contributions, and Tarski and Givant (1999) discuss the history.

=== Fundamental relations ===

These axioms are a more elegant version of a set Tarski devised in the 1920s as part of his investigation of the metamathematical properties of [[Euclidean plane geometry]]. This objective required reformulating that geometry as a [[first-order logic|first-order theory]]. Tarski did so by positing a [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] of [[point (geometry)|point]]s, with lower case letters denoting variables ranging over that universe.  [[Equality (mathematics)|Equality]] is provided by the underlying logic (see [[First-order logic#Equality and its axioms]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tarski and Givant, 1999, page 177&lt;/ref&gt;  Tarski then posited two primitive relations:
* ''Betweenness'', a [[triadic relation]]. The [[atomic sentence]] ''Bxyz'' denotes that ''y'' is "between" ''x'' and ''z'', in other words, that ''y'' is a point on the [[line segment]] ''xz''.  (This relation is interpreted inclusively, so that ''Bxyz'' is trivially true whenever ''x=y'' or ''y=z'').
* ''[[congruence (geometry)|Congruence]]'' (or "equidistance"), a [[polyadic relation|tetradic relation]].  The [[atomic sentence]] ''wx'' ≡ ''yz'' can be interpreted as ''wx'' is [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to ''yz'', in other words, that the [[distance|length]] of the line segment ''wx'' is equal to the length of the line segment ''yz''.

Betweenness captures the [[affine geometry|affine]] aspect of Euclidean geometry; congruence, its [[metric space|metric]] aspect. The background logic includes [[identity (mathematics)|identity]], a [[binary relation]]. The axioms invoke identity (or its negation) on five occasions.

The axioms below are grouped by the types of relation they invoke, then sorted, first by the number of existential quantifiers, then by the number of atomic sentences. The axioms should be read as [[universal closure]]s; hence any [[free variable]]s should be taken as tacitly [[universal quantifier|universally quantified]].

=== Congruence axioms ===

; Reflexivity of Congruence:
: &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv yx\,.&lt;/math&gt;

; Identity of Congruence:
: &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv zz \rightarrow x=y.&lt;/math&gt;

; [[Transitive relation|Transitivity]] of Congruence:
: &lt;math&gt;(xy \equiv zu \land xy \equiv vw) \rightarrow zu \equiv vw.&lt;/math&gt;

====Commentary====
While the congruence relation &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv zw&lt;/math&gt; is, formally, a 4-way relation among points, it may also be thought of, informally, as a binary relation between two line segments &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;zw&lt;/math&gt;.  The "Reflexivity" and "Transitivity" axioms above, combined, prove both:
* that this binary relation is in fact an [[equivalence relation]]
** it is reflexive: &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv xy&lt;/math&gt;.
** it is symmetric &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv zw \rightarrow zw \equiv xy&lt;/math&gt;.
** it is transitive &lt;math&gt;(xy \equiv zu \land zu \equiv vw) \rightarrow xy \equiv vw&lt;/math&gt;.
* and that the order in which the points of a line segment are specified is irrelevant.
** &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv zw \rightarrow xy \equiv wz&lt;/math&gt;.
** &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv zw \rightarrow yx \equiv zw&lt;/math&gt;.
** &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv zw \rightarrow yx \equiv wz&lt;/math&gt;.

The "transitivity" axiom asserts that congruence is [[Euclidean relation|Euclidean]], in that it respects the first of [[Euclid's elements|Euclid's]] "[[Euclid's axioms#Axiomatic approach|common notions]]".

The "Identity of Congruence" axiom states, intuitively, that if ''xy'' is congruent with a segment that begins and ends at the same point,''x'' and ''y'' are the same point. This is closely related to the notion of [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]] for [[binary relation]]s.

=== Betweenness axioms ===
[[File:Tarski's formulation of Pasch's axiom.svg|right|thumb|Pasch's axiom]]
; Identity of Betweenness
: &lt;math&gt;Bxyx \rightarrow x=y.&lt;/math&gt;
The only point on the line segment &lt;math&gt;xx&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; itself.

&lt;!--
; Transitivity of betweenness
: &lt;math&gt;(wxy \land xyz) \rArr wxz&lt;/math&gt;
If ''x'' is between ''w'' and ''y'', and if ''y'' is between ''x'' and ''z'', then ''x'' must be between ''w'' and ''z''.

; Connectivity of betweenness
: &lt;math&gt;(xyz \land xyw \land x \ne y) \rArr (xzw \lor xwz).&lt;/math&gt;
If ''y'' is between ''x'' and ''z'' and between ''x'' and ''w'', ''w'' and ''z'' must both be on the same side of ''x''. Connectivity and Transitivity order the points.--&gt;

; [[Axiom of Pasch]]
: &lt;math&gt;(Bxuz \land Byvz) \rightarrow \exists a\, (Buay \land Bvax).&lt;/math&gt;
The two diagonals of the [[quadrilateral]] &lt;math&gt;xuvy&lt;/math&gt; must intersect at some point.

[[File:Tarski's continuity axiom.svg|right|thumb|Continuity: φ and ψ divide the ray into two halves and the axiom asserts the existence of a point b dividing those two halves]]
; [[Axiom schema]] of Continuity
Let φ(''x'') and ψ(''y'') be [[first order logic|first-order formulae]] containing no [[free variable|free instances]] of either ''a'' or ''b''. Let there also be no free instances of ''x'' in ψ(''y'') or of ''y'' in φ(''x''). Then all instances of the following schema are axioms:
: &lt;math&gt;\exists a \,\forall x\, \forall y\,[(\phi(x) \land \psi(y)) \rightarrow Baxy] \rightarrow \exists b\, \forall x\, \forall y\,[(\phi(x) \land \psi(y)) \rightarrow Bxby].&lt;/math&gt;
Let ''r'' be a ray with endpoint ''a''. Let the first order formulae φ and ψ define subsets ''X'' and ''Y'' of ''r'', such that every point in ''Y'' is to the right of every point of ''X'' (with respect to ''a''). Then there exists a point ''b'' in ''r'' lying between ''X'' and ''Y''. This is essentially the [[Dedekind cut]] construction, carried out in a way that avoids quantification over sets.

; Lower [[Dimension]]
: &lt;math&gt;\exists a \, \exists b\, \exists c\, [\neg Babc \land \neg Bbca \land \neg Bcab].&lt;/math&gt;
There exist three noncollinear points.  Without this axiom, the theory could be [[model theory|modeled]] by the one-dimensional [[real line]], a single point, or even the empty set.

=== Congruence and betweenness ===

[[File:Points in a plane equidistant to two given points lie on a line.svg|right|thumb|Upper dimension]]
; Upper [[Dimension]]
: &lt;math&gt;(xu \equiv xv \land yu \equiv yv \land zu \equiv zv \land u \ne v) \rightarrow (Bxyz \lor Byzx \lor Bzxy).&lt;/math&gt;
Three points equidistant from two distinct points form a line. Without this axiom, the theory could be modeled by [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] or higher-dimensional space.

; Axiom of Euclid
Each of the three variants of this axiom, all equivalent over the remaining Tarski's axioms to Euclid's [[parallel postulate]], has an advantage over the others:
* '''A''' dispenses with [[existential quantifier]]s;
* '''B''' has the fewest variables and [[atomic sentence]]s;
* '''C''' requires but one primitive notion, betweenness. This variant is the usual one given in the literature.

: '''A''': &lt;math&gt;((Bxyw \land xy \equiv yw ) \land (Bxuv \land xu \equiv uv) \land (Byuz \land yu \equiv zu)) \rightarrow yz \equiv vw.&lt;/math&gt;
Let a line segment join the midpoint of two sides of a given [[triangle]]. That line segment will be half as long as the third side. This is equivalent to the [[interior angle]]s of any triangle summing to two [[right angles]].

: '''B''': &lt;math&gt;Bxyz \lor Byzx \lor Bzxy \lor \exists a\, (xa \equiv ya \land xa \equiv za).&lt;/math&gt;
Given any [[triangle]], there exists a [[circle]] that includes all of its vertices.

[[File:Tarski's axiom of Euclid C.svg|thumb|right|Axiom of Euclid: C]]
: '''C''': &lt;math&gt;(Bxuv \land Byuz \land x \ne u) \rightarrow \exists a\, \exists b\,(Bxya \land Bxzb \land Bavb).&lt;/math&gt;
Given any [[angle]] and any point ''v'' in its interior, there exists a line segment including ''v'', with an endpoint on each side of the angle.

; Five Segment
[[File:Five segment.svg|thumb|right|Five segment]]
:&lt;math&gt;{(x \ne y  \land  Bxyz  \land  Bx'y'z'  \land xy \equiv x'y' \land yz \equiv y'z' \land xu \equiv x'u' \land yu \equiv y'u')} \rightarrow zu \equiv z'u'.&lt;/math&gt;
Begin with two [[triangle]]s, ''xuz'' and ''x'u'z'.'' Draw the line segments ''yu'' and ''y'u','' connecting a vertex of each triangle to a point on the side opposite to the vertex. The result is two divided triangles, each made up of five segments. If four segments of one triangle are each [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to a segment in the other triangle, then the fifth segments in both triangles must be congruent.

; Segment Construction
: &lt;math&gt; \exists z\, [Bxyz \land yz \equiv ab].&lt;/math&gt;
For any point ''y'', it is possible to draw in any direction (determined by ''x'') a line congruent to any segment ''ab''.

==Discussion==
Starting from two primitive [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] whose fields are a [[Dense-in-itself|dense]] [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] of [[point (geometry)|point]]s, Tarski built a geometry of [[line segment]]s. According to Tarski and Givant (1999: 192-93), none of the above [[axiom]]s are fundamentally new. The first four axioms establish some elementary properties of the two primitive relations. For instance, Reflexivity and Transitivity of Congruence establish that congruence is an [[equivalence relation]] over line segments. The Identity of Congruence and of Betweenness govern the trivial case when those relations are applied to nondistinct points. The theorem ''xy''≡''zz'' ↔ ''x''=''y'' ↔ ''Bxyx'' extends these Identity axioms.

A number of other properties of Betweenness are derivable as theorems including:
*[[Reflexive relation|Reflexivity]]: ''Bxxy'' ;
*[[Symmetry]]: ''Bxyz'' → ''Bzyx'' ;
*[[Transitive relation|Transitivity]]: (''Bxyw'' ∧ ''Byzw'') → ''Bxyz'' ;
*[[Connection (mathematics)|Connectivity]]: (''Bxyw'' ∧ ''Bxzw'') → (''Bxyz'' ∨ ''Bxzy'').
The last two properties [[total order|totally order]] the points making up a line segment.

Upper and Lower Dimension together require that any model of these axioms have a specific finite [[dimension]]ality. Suitable changes in these axioms yield axiom sets for [[Euclidean geometry]] for [[dimension]]s 0, 1, and greater than 2 (Tarski and Givant 1999: Axioms 8&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, 8&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;, 9&lt;sup&gt;(0)&lt;/sup&gt;, 9&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, 9&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt; ). Note that [[solid geometry]] requires no new axioms, unlike the case with [[Hilbert's axioms]]. Moreover, Lower Dimension for ''n'' dimensions is simply the negation of Upper Dimension for ''n'' - 1 dimensions.

When dimension &gt; 1, Betweenness can be defined in terms of [[congruence relation|congruence]] (Tarski and Givant, 1999). First define the relation "≤" (where &lt;math&gt;ab \leq cd&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted "the length of line segment &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; is less than or equal to the length of line segment &lt;math&gt;cd&lt;/math&gt;"):
:&lt;math&gt;xy \le zu \leftrightarrow \forall v ( zv \equiv uv \rightarrow \exists w ( xw \equiv yw \land yw \equiv uv ) ).&lt;/math&gt;
In the case of two dimensions, the intuition is as follows:  For any line segment ''xy'', consider the possible range of lengths of ''xv'', where ''v'' is any point on the perpendicular bisector of ''xy''.  It is apparent that while there is no upper bound to the length of ''xv'', there is a lower bound, which occurs when ''v'' is the midpoint of ''xy''.  So if ''xy'' is shorter than or equal to ''zu'', then the range of possible lengths of ''xv'' will be a superset of the range of possible lengths of ''zw'', where ''w'' is any point on the perpendicular bisector of ''zu''.

Betweenness can then be defined by using the intuition that the shortest distance between any two points is a straight line:
:&lt;math&gt;Bxyz \leftrightarrow \forall u ( ( ux \le xy \land uz \le zy ) \rightarrow u = y ).&lt;/math&gt;

The Axiom Schema of Continuity assures that the ordering of points on a line is [[Dedekind complete|complete]] (with respect to first-order definable properties). The Axioms of [[Pasch's axiom|Pasch]] and Euclid are well known. Remarkably, Euclidean geometry requires just the following further axioms:
* ''Segment Construction''. This axiom makes [[measurement]] and the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] possible—simply assign the value of 1 to some arbitrary non-empty line segment;{{clarify|date=December 2011}}&lt;!-- what would this axiom look like? --&gt;
&lt;!-- Already included above * ''Five Segments''. This bears on the [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]] of [[triangle]]s.{{Contradict|date=May 2012}}--&gt;

Let ''wff'' stand for a [[well-formed formula]] (or syntactically correct formula) of elementary geometry. Tarski and Givant (1999: 175) proved that elementary geometry is:
*[[consistency|Consistent]]: There is no wff such that it and its negation are both theorems;
*[[complete theory|Complete]]: Every sentence or its negation is a theorem provable from the axioms;
*[[Decidability (logic)|Decidable]]: There exists an [[algorithm]] that assigns a [[truth value]] to every sentence. This follows from Tarski's:
** [[Decision procedure]] for the [[real closed field]], which he found by [[quantifier elimination]] (the [[Tarski–Seidenberg theorem]]);
**Axioms admitting of a (multi-dimensional) faithful [[interpretability|interpretation]] as a [[real closed field]].
Gupta (1965) proved the above axioms independent, ''Pasch'' and ''Reflexivity of Congruence'' excepted.

Negating the Axiom of Euclid yields [[hyperbolic geometry]], while eliminating it outright yields [[absolute geometry]]. Full (as opposed to elementary) Euclidean geometry requires giving up a first order axiomatization: replace φ(''x'') and ψ(''y'') in the axiom schema of Continuity with ''x'' ∈ ''A'' and ''y'' ∈ ''B'', where ''A'' and ''B'' are universally quantified variables ranging over sets of points.

==Comparison with Hilbert==
[[Hilbert's axioms]] for plane geometry number 16, and include Transitivity of Congruence and a variant of the Axiom of Pasch. The only notion from intuitive geometry invoked in the remarks to Tarski's axioms is [[triangle]]. (Versions '''B''' and '''C''' of the Axiom of Euclid refer to '"circle" and "angle," respectively.) Hilbert's axioms also require "ray," "angle," and the notion of a triangle "including" an angle. In addition to betweenness and congruence, Hilbert's axioms require a primitive [[binary relation]] "on," linking a point and a line. The [[Axiom schema]] of Continuity plays a role similar to Hilbert's two axioms of Continuity. This schema is indispensable; Euclidean geometry in Tarski's (or equivalent) language cannot be finitely axiomatized as a [[first-order logic|first-order theory]]. Hilbert's axioms do not constitute a first-order theory because his continuity axioms require [[second-order logic]].

The first four groups of axioms of [[Hilbert's axioms]] for plane geometry are bi-interpretable with Tarski's axioms minus continuity.

{{Thomism}}

This article contains a selection of '''thoughts of [[Thomas Aquinas]]''' on various topics. It is not intended as a complete account of Aquinas's thought. Within Aquinas' thought is included the philosophical school of [[Thomism]].

==Social justice==
Aquinas defines distributive justice as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[I]n distributive justice something is given to a private individual, in so far as what belongs to the whole is due to the part, and in a quantity that is proportionate to the importance of the position of that part in respect of the whole. Consequently in distributive justice a person receives all the more of the common goods, according as he holds a more prominent position in the community. This prominence in an aristocratic community is gauged according to virtue, in an oligarchy according to wealth, in a democracy according to liberty, and in various ways according to various forms of community. Hence in distributive justice the mean is observed, not according to equality between thing and thing, but according to proportion between things and persons: in such a way that even as one person surpasses another, so that which is given to one person surpasses that which is allotted to another.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Aquinas asserts that Christians have a duty to distribute with provision to the poorest of society.  (See: Gilson, Etienne, "The Christian Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas", University of Notre Dame Press, 1994)

==Death penalty==
The following is a summary of [[Summa Contra Gentiles]], [http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/scg3111.html#27017 Book 3, Chapter 146], which was written by Aquinas prior to writing the [[Summa Theologica]].  St. Thomas was a vocal supporter of the death penalty.  This was based on the theory (found in [[Natural Moral Law|natural moral law]]), that the state has not only the right, but the duty to protect its citizens from enemies, both from within, and without.

For those who have been appropriately appointed, there is no sin in administering punishment. For those who refuse to obey God's laws, it is correct for society to rebuke them with civil and criminal sanctions. No one sins working for justice and within the law. Actions that are necessary to preserve the good of society are not inherently evil. The common good of the whole society is greater and better than the good of any particular person. ''"The life of certain pestiferous men is an impediment to the common good which is the concord of human society. Therefore, certain men must be removed by death from the society of men."''  This is likened to the physician who must amputate a diseased limb, or a cancer, for the good of the whole person. He based this on [[I Corinthians]] 5, 6:  "You know that a little leaven corrupts the whole lump of dough?"  and [[I Corinthians]] 5, 13:  "Put away the evil one from among yourselves";  [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 13,4: "[it is said of earthly power that] he bears not the sword in vain: for he is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil";  [[I Peter]] 2, 13-14: "Be subjected therefore to every human creature for God's sake: whether to be on the king as excelling, or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of good."  He believed these passages superseded the text of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20,13: "Thou shall not kill."  This is mentioned again in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5,21. Also, it is argued that [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 13, 30: "Suffer both the weeds and the wheat to grow until the harvest." The harvest was interpreted as meaning the end of the world. This is explained by Matthew 13,38-40.

Aquinas acknowledged these passages could also be interpreted as meaning there should be no use of the death penalty if there was a chance of injuring the innocent. The prohibition "Thou shall not kill", was superseded by [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22,18: "Wrongdoers you shall not suffer to live."  The argument that evildoers should be allowed to live in the hope that they might be redeemed was rejected by Aquinas as frivolous. If they would not repent in the face of death, it was unreasonable to assume they would ever repent.  ''"How many people are we to allow to be murdered while waiting for the repentance of the wrongdoer?"'', he asked, rhetorically. Using the death penalty for revenge, or retribution is a violation of natural moral law.

Many believe the correct interpretation of the commandment to be "Thou shalt not murder." This interpretation allows for Aquinas' belief that the death penalty is an acceptable practice as delivered by those in authority over such things, such as government, which is divinely appointed as to God's will.

Under [[Pope John Paul II]], the Catholic Church came, according to one of two interpretations of ''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thomist.org/journal/1999/994aLong.htm|accessdate=2011-03-20|year=1999|title=''Evangelium Vitae'', St. Thomas Aquinas, and the Death Penalty|author=Steven A. Long|journal=[http://www.thomist.org/journal/explore.htm The Thomist]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031102034854/http://www.thomist.org/journal/1999/994along.htm|archivedate=2003-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to advocate incarceration in lieu of the death penalty.

==Heretics==

Aquinas advocated the death penalty for obstinate heretics, writing
&lt;blockquote&gt;With regard to heretics two points must be observed: one, on their own side; the other, on the side of the Church. On their own side there is the sin, whereby they deserve not only to be separated from the Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from the world by death. For it is a much graver matter to corrupt the faith which quickens the soul, than to forge money, which supports temporal life. Wherefore if forgers of money and other evil-doers are forthwith condemned to death by the secular authority, much more reason is there for heretics, as soon as they are convicted of heresy, to be not only excommunicated but even put to death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;On the part of the Church, however, there is mercy which looks to the conversion of the wanderer, wherefore she condemns not at once, but "after the first and second admonition," as the Apostle directs: after that, if he is yet stubborn, the Church no longer hoping for his conversion, looks to the salvation of others, by excommunicating him and separating him from the Church, and furthermore delivers him to the secular tribunal to be exterminated thereby from the world by death. For Jerome commenting on Galatians 5:9, "A little leaven," says: "Cut off the decayed flesh, expel the mangy sheep from the fold, lest the whole house, the whole paste, the whole body, the whole flock, burn, perish, rot, die. Arius was but one spark in Alexandria, but as that spark was not at once put out, the whole earth was laid waste by its flame." ([http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article3 ST II:II 11:3 ''corpus''])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This position of Aquinas was congruous with the political and religious teaching of the day. The penalty of death for obdurate heretics had been the standard for generations prior to the time of Aquinas. It had been formalized in [[Canon Law]] during the Lateran Councils of 1179 and 1215. It was also the standard part of most criminal and civil laws prior to the time of Aquinas. Cathars were executed in Oxford in 1166. Another was burned at the stake in London in 1210. Of course, these, and many others pre-dated Aquinas. Since it was the Church's responsibility to attend to the eternal salvation of souls, heresy could not be tolerated. Heretics were given two chances to recant their views. This is a position which, by modern standards would be considered exceptionally harsh, and has changed and softened since the 13th century. The Church was inexorably intermixed with the secular political structure. This was before the modern concept of separation of church and state had developed. It was also a product of [[Scholasticism]] which did not seek to find an [[equivocal]] position, but rather to reach a decisive [[univocal]] conclusion on matters of religion and philosophy.

As can be seen by reading the article of Michael Novak{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, Aquinas' view in this matter is one of the more difficult parts of dealing with [[Thomism]] Needless to say, the attitudes of Aquinas were prevalent in his time. This view must be taken in context with the attitude shown by Aquinas in eschewing the forced baptism of the children of heretics, which was recommended by, among others, [[John Duns Scotus]]. The heretics Aquinas was referring to were those baptized Catholics who held positions of authority within the Church, and nonetheless persisted in teaching heretical views. It remains one of those passages which must be taken in context of the total message of Thomism. The growth of various heretical positions, leading to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], made execution of heretics impractical and counterproductive. Excommunication remained the penalty for such Church leaders who taught heresy. Aquinas' view is steeped in the traditions of [[Roman Law]]. A review of the legal history prior to the time of Aquinas reveals the nature of recommending execution of heretics. The issue came to a head with the Manichean (Cathari) heresy.  [[Justinian]]'s code confirmed that Manicheanism was a capital crime. It was concluded that other heretics were to be deemed no better. The opinion prevailed in legal circles that human law and divine command demanded the death of the obdurate heretic. It was routinely enforced by both Church and State. In severe cases of religious pestilence, there was a need for a holy war. These prevailing feelings were legislated by the Church in the [[Lateran Council]]s of 1179 and 1215.

The impenitent heretic when convicted by the ecclesiastical court for execution.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Often, there was a plea for the life of the heretic, so as to avoid the appearance of "irregularity" and blood guilt.  [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], (1194–1250) incorporated the execution of heretics into his civil and criminal code of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

==Usury==
Firstly, economics in the Middle Ages worked very differently from how they operate in the modern age. The [[Fifth Lateran Council]] defined [[usury]] as "from its use, a thing which produces nothing is applied to the acquiring of gain and profit without any work, any expense or any risk",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scripturecatholic.com/usury.html&lt;/ref&gt; and that the modern idea of what the usury is cannot be applied to Thomasian thought.

St. Thomas asserted that usury was a violation of [[Natural Moral Law|natural moral law]]. All things are created for their natural end ([[Aristotle]]).   Money is not an end but a means of buying goods and services. Putting money out for the generation of more money is an evil unto itself.   The formal value of money is the face value. Yet usury allows this face value to fluctuate, and hence the value of money can be diminished, thereby robbing the person who has purchased the money for use. Money stands alone as a non-vendible substance which is degraded from its natural end by selling.

Another argument used by Aquinas was that of the Roman distinction between consumable goods and non-consumable goods. Food and clothes are consumable in that once they are used, they are gone. A piece of land is non-consumable since it can produce crops for years, yet never lose its value. Money as defined by Aquinas is a consumable. To put it out for profit betrays its purpose in natural law. This is the view that prevailed for the next three centuries following St. Thomas' death.

Yet it was the one Realistic Scholastic interpretation of natural law that was completely disconnected from the economic reality of the day. The time of Aquinas was one where land feudalism was ceding prominence to money capitalism. Over the next several centuries it became clear that capitalism would provide a greater amount of goods and services than any other system.

Even in the time of Aquinas (and before), kings and popes engaged in usury. Some of the effects of [[Protestantism]] were a clarification of the views and acceptance of the practice of usury. Profit from lending became an acceptable goal. The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) adopted Aquinas' view of usury, calling it a sin of equal gravity to that of [[homicide]]. This included putting money out for any return, no matter how minimal. It can be argued that this rigid stance may have encouraged the [[Protestant]] movement in larger money and trading centers.

Our views concerning [[capitalism]], [[unfair labor practice]], [[living wage]], [[price gouging]], [[monopolies]], fair trade practices, and [[predatory pricing]], inter alia, are remnants of the inculcation of Aquinas' interpretation of natural moral law.  (See Colish p.&amp;nbsp;333–334).

The issue was never as clear as the stance Aquinas took would indicate. From [[Pope Gregory IX]]  (written about 1241, when Aquinas was 16 years old):  "He who loans a sum of money to one sailing or going to market, since he has assumed upon himself a risk, is not to be considered a usurer who will receive something beyond his lot. He also who gives ten solidi (a monetary unit), so that at another time just as many measures of grain, wine and oil may be paid back to him, and although these are worth more at the present time, it is probably doubtful whether at the time of payment, they will be worth more or less, for this reason, should not be considered a usurer. By reason of this doubt he is also excused, who sells clothing, grain, wine, oil, or other wares so that as a set time he receives for them more than they are worth at that time, if however, he had not intended so to sell them at the time of the contract."  (See Denzinger, p.&amp;nbsp;178). In other words, if the lender of the money  "assumed the risk" ("[[assumpsit]]" in Latin), along with the borrower, it was not usury.

A century earlier, in the Second Lateran Council, ([[Second Council of the Lateran]]), under the aegis of [[Pope Innocent II]] (1139) called the practice of loaning money "detestable and shameful... insatiable rapacity of money lenders, forbidden both by divine and human laws throughout the Old and New Testament, we condemn, and separate from the ecclesiastical consolation..."  (Denzinger p.&amp;nbsp;148–149).

The [[Council of Vienne]] (1311–1312) under [[Pope Clement V]] declared:  "If anyone shall fall into that error, so that he obstinately presumes to declare that it is not a sin to exercise usury, we decree that he must be punished as a heretic."  (Denzinger p.&amp;nbsp;189). The distinction between usury and putting money out while "assuming the risk" was not mentioned. However, it could be argued that any time one assumed the risk, it was not considered usury.

There was always some confusion, and variance, in this teaching during the Middle Ages. The [[Fifth Lateran Council]], (1515) decreed that a "reasonable degree of return" was allowable.  (Denzinger p.&amp;nbsp;238). The social evil that was associated with usury was the fact that poor tenant farmers and city dwellers were often thrown into prison, or even killed if they could not repay the money they borrowed, and the interest charged. In these cases, the lenders of the money had assumed no risk. The [[Franciscan]] [[St. Anthony of Padua]] (1195–1231 AD) preached against this evil.

These events were occurring at a time when the [[Ecclesiastical Courts]] had great judicial power. There were several philosophical cross currents at play. On the one hand, the Canon Lawyers looked favorably on the products of labor, wages and profit, while holding suspect speculation, banking and finance. The Church discountenanced the fluctuations of wages and prices caused by the law of [[supply and demand]]. There was an attempt to maintain fixed standards of value. At the same time, there was a liberal and equitable view toward the old Roman idea of "[[contract]]". The Church Courts invented and refined the idea of "consideration" ; the [[quid pro quo]] in modern contract. This was something that was lacking in Roman contract.  [[Insurance]], [[assignability]] and [[negotiability]] were developments in the Church Courts. These areas were largely ignored by the [[Common Law]], or secular law of the day, especially in England (Plucknett p.&amp;nbsp;302,304).

The Catholic Church's teaching on social doctrine has grown significantly more complicated since that time. It is beyond the scope of this article to delve into modern teaching. A summary can be found in the new Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 2419–2463.

==Forced baptism of children of Jews and heretics==
The question frequently arose whether the children of Jews and other heretics and non-believers should be baptized against the will of their parents. Two schools of thought were generally followed:
# The First School: That since all persons who were not baptized would be damned to hell, all children should be baptized. This was the position of [[John Duns Scotus]]. It could be argued that this approach reduced the sacrament of baptism to nothing but a "magical" rite. 
# The Second School: That it violated [[natural law]] to disrupt the order of the family by interfering.

Therefore, even if children were being reared in error, the Church had no authority to intervene. This was the position taken by Aquinas. From [[Summa Theologica]] II-II Q. 10 Art. 12:
:Injustice should be done to no man. Now it would be an injustice to Jews if their children were to be baptized against their will, since they would lose the rights of parental authority over their children as soon as these were Christians. Therefore these should not be baptized against their parent's will. The custom of the Church has been given very great authority and ought to be jealously observed in all things, since the very doctrine of Catholic Doctors derives its authority from the Church. Hence we ought to abide by the authority of the Church rather than that of an [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] or a [[Jerome]] or any doctor whatever. Now it was never the custom of the Church to baptize the children of Jews against the will of their parents. There are two reasons for this custom. One is on account of the danger to faith. For children baptized before coming into the use of reason, might easily be persuaded by their parents to renounce what they had unknowingly embraced; and this would be detrimental to the faith. The other reason is that it is against natural justice. For a child is by nature part of its father: at first, it is not distinct from its parents as to its body, so long as it is enfolded within the mother's womb and later on after birth, and before it has the use of [[free will]], it is enfolded in the care of its parents, like a spiritual womb. So long as a man does not have the use of reason, he is no different from an irrational animal. Hence, it would be contrary to natural justice, if a child, before coming to the use of reason, were to be taken away from its parent's custody, or anything done against its parent's wish.

The question was again addressed by Aquinas in [[Summa Theologica]] III Q. 68 Art. 10:
:It is written in the Decretals (Dist. xiv), quoting the [[Council of Toledo]]: In regard to the Jews the holy synod commands that henceforth none of them be forced to believe; for such are not to be saved against their will, but willingly, that their righteousness may be without flaw. Children of non-believers either have the use of reason or they have not. If they have, then they already begin to control their own actions, in things that are of Divine or natural law. And therefore, of their own accord, and against the will of their parents, they can receive Baptism, just as they can contract in marriage. Consequently such can be lawfully advised and persuaded to be baptized. If, however, they have not yet the use of free-will, according to the natural law they are under the care of their parents as long as they cannot look after themselves. For which reason we say that even the children of the ancients were saved through the faith of their parents.

The issue was discussed in a papal bull by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] (1747) where both schools were addressed. The pope noted that the position of Aquinas had been more widely held among theologians and canon lawyers, than that of John Duns Scotus (See Denzinger).

==Existentialism==
A primary goal of all philosophy is the proof of existence: the existence of God, the universe, and the self (see Colish, Macdonald-Cornford, Russell, Nahm, Pieper, Gilson). Although St. Thomas "five proofs" are the most referenced, they are targeted toward a Catholic audience.  In Summa Contra Gentiles, Thomas provides a much lengthier and detailed proof that does not rely on divine revelation.  God's existence is established based on the proposition that man's reason is capable of apprehending a cause from its effects.  After analyzing motion, it becomes apparent that the first mover must be unmoved, without cause, and uncreated.  From this, it then follows that the unmoved mover must be without change, and, therefore, must be eternal.  The understanding that goodness and being are interchangeable leads to the realization that God is goodness.  God is also found to be intelligent because he is not composed of matter nor is the form of any body.  Since God is the first cause, His effects can be observed by the diversity found in creation, and the study of this is the study of Divine Providence.  After building a foundation of proofs based upon natural reasoning, Aquinas then demonstrates that the Catholic Faith cannot be disproved and goes on to defend various positions against the Incarnation, the sacraments, and the Resurrection.  This line of thought is also followed in the Summa Theologica and the Compendium of Theology.

A basic question of Greek Philosophy: Can an organized hierarchy (as is seen in nature) exist in the absence of an intelligence?  In the atheistic view, the answer is "yes". If one answers "no", then there is a necessity of an intelligent God. The Greeks called this ultimate intelligence the "gnos" or "nous" (Nahm pp.&amp;nbsp;1–28). However, the intimate nature of this intelligence cannot be delineated by human contemplation. Many philosophers concluded that the [[Universe]] itself, was the God (Gilson). It was basically indifferent the needs of the human. This is very different from the Judeo-Christian concept of an intimate and loving God, aware of all.

Some Greek philosophers such as [[Zeno of Citium]], [[Chrysippus]], [[Plotinus]], [[Thales of Miletus]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Parmenides]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] came to the conclusion that there had to be a God. Their conclusions were based on various physical observations: there could be no infinity of actions, therefore, there must be an unmoving mover, which moves without moving. This is the prime mover. There has to be a beginning and an end, otherwise, everything would have happened long ago and not now. This is also seen in Jewish philosophy (which may be based on Greek philosophy). There must be an ultimate smallness, of which there can be nothing smaller: the atomus ([[Leucippus]], [[Democritus]]). This was in response to the [[Paradoxes of Zeno]]: there could be no motion, since every moving body would have to pass through half the distance, then one-quarter the distance, etc. A body could not pass through an infinite number of points. This led to the conclusion that all nature was united: the doctrine of the "One". Therefore, the human mind could reasonably conclude that there was a single God, and that this God existed (For an overview see Gilson p.&amp;nbsp;29-83; Russell pp.&amp;nbsp;453–463). This God had to be intelligent.

When Moses wished to know the name of God in order to reveal it to the Jewish people, he asked God directly.  [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 3, 13-14:  "'Lo!  I go to the children of Israel, and I shall say to them: the God of your fathers sent me to you. If they ask me His name what shall I say to them?'  God replied: 'I Am Who Am.'  Then He added, 'Thus will you reply to the children of Israel: He Who Is sends me to you.'"  Therefore, the proper name of God is "I Am" or "Who Is". This was a remarkable exposition on several levels. First, the idea that the great, unapproachable God of the Hebrews would provide His name was exceptional. Recall that in these ancient cultures, to know the name of a person was to possess them, or a part of them, in some way. Also, the name is unusual. What did this mean? (Gilson) The only means available to the early Christians for evaluating philosophy was provided by the Greeks. Largely, this was within the Stoic school, which had been re-invigorated by the Persians whom Alexander the Great had brought back to Greece. These in turn, influenced the Roman Stoic Schools which affected both pagan and Christian thought (Colish pp.&amp;nbsp;9, 12,21, 179-180, 300-301; Russell pp.&amp;nbsp;252–270). Christianity has been described as a religion without a need for a philosophic basis. The Stoics gave it one (Gilson, p.&amp;nbsp;84).

[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] was convinced that the God of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] was Plato's being. He speculated that [[Plato]] must have known of Exodus.  "But what makes me almost subscribe to the idea that Plato was not completely ignorant of the [[Old Testament]] is that when the Angel conveys the words of God to the holy man [[Moses]], who asks the name of the one who is sending him to proceed to the deliverance of the Hebrew people, the reply is:  'I Am Who Am', and you are to say to the children of Israel: 'it is He Who is Who has sent me to you.'  It was as if, in comparison with him who truly is because he is immovable, he who has been made movable did not exist. Now Plato was intensely convinced of this and he took great care to say so."  (Augustine De Civ. Dei 8:11, PL 41,236). The Being in Exodus was the same immovable entity of Plato, according to [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. he called the immovable being of Plato, "The first and highest being is that which is entirely immovable, and which can say by full right: 'I Am Who Am'; and you will tell them, 'He Who Is has sent me to you.'" (St. Augustine, De doctrina christiana, I, 32,5; PL 34, 32).

St. Augustine had a very deep sense of the difficulty of the problem presented by this tract. He asked the question "I Am" what?  From [[Gospel of John|John]] 8, 24: "If you do not believe that I Am, you will die in your sins."  But Augustine asked, "si non credideritis quia ego sum?"  (I Am What?)  There was nothing added. Augustine found this embarrassing.  "We were waiting for Him to say what He was, and He says nothing."  Augustine: "If you do not believe that I Am the Christ; if you do not believe that I Am the Son of God; if you do not believe that I Am the Word of the Father; if you do not believe that I Am the author of the world; if you do not believe that I Am the former and the reformer of man, his creator and recreator, He Who made him and remade him; if you do not believe that I Am that, you will die in your sins. This I Am, He says He Is, is embarrassing. Even if [[Moses]] could understand this, how could the people to whom he was being sent understand it?  In point of fact, he did add: 'I Am the God of [[Abraham]], and the God of [[Isaac]], and the God of [[Jacob]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 3, 13-15)([[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] on the Gospel of St. John)  (Gilson, p.&amp;nbsp;85)

This is the source of the doctrine of divine essentialitas, or [[essential theology]] of Augustine which would influence [[Richard of St. Victor]], [[Alexander of Hales]] and [[St. Bonaventure]]. By this method, the essence of God is defined by what God is, and also by describing what God is not ([[negative theology]]). St. Thomas took the text of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] beyond the explanation of essential theology. He bridged the gap of understanding between the [[being of essence]] and the [[being of existence]]. In [[Summa Theologica]], the way is prepared with the proofs for the existence of God. All that remained was to recognize the God of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] as having the nature of "Him Who is the supreme act of being". God is simple, there is no composition in God. In this regard, Aquinas relied on [[Boethius]] who in turn followed the path of [[Platonism]], something Aquinas usually avoided. The conclusion was that the meaning of "I Am Who Am" is not an enigma to be answered, but the statement of the essence of God. This is the discovery of Aquinas: the essence of God is not described by negative analogy, but the "essence of God is to exist". This is the basis of "[[existential theology]]" and leads to what Gilson calls the first and only existential philosophy. In Latin, this is called "Haec Sublimis Veritas", "the sublime truth". The revealed essence of God is to exist, or in the words of Aquinas, I am the pure Act of Being. This has been described as the key to understanding [[Thomism]]. Thomism has been described (in terms of a philosophic movement), as either the emptiest, or the fullest of philosophies. (For a full discussion, see Gilson, pp.&amp;nbsp;84–95)

The '''Trager approach''' is a form of [[somatics|somatic education]]. Proponents claim the Trager approach helps release deep-seated physical and mental patterns and facilitates deep [[relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], increased physical mobility, and [[mental clarity]].&lt;ref&gt;Trivieri, Larry, and John W.

He was an athlete, dancer, and bodybuilder. He began doing bodywork with no training and later worked under a variety of practitioner licenses, including an MD earned in Mexico followed by 2 years residency in psychiatry.&lt;ref name= "Stillerman" /&gt; Trager wanted western medicine to accept his proposed mind-body connection in treating challenging conditions such as postpolio, Parkinson's, and other neuromuscular conditions. Doctors reportedly referred patients to him and were surprised by the results, but "none seemed to consider his drugless treatments as effective as surgery or medication" and the medical approach to these conditions did not fundamentally shift away from them as he had envisioned.&lt;ref name="Stillerman"/&gt;

[[File:Blank Fork.png|thumb|Situations often arise wherein a decision must be made when the results of each possible choice are uncertain.]]
'''Uncertainty''' is a situation which involves imperfect or unknown [[information]]. It applies to predictions of future events, to physical measurements that are already made, or to the unknown. Uncertainty arises in [[partially observable]] and/or [[stochastic]] environments, as well as due to [[ignorance]], [[Laziness|indolence]], or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Peter Norvig]] |author2=[[Sebastian Thrun]] |work=[[Udacity]] |url=https://www.udacity.com/wiki/cs271/unit1_notes |title=Introduction to Artificial Intelligence}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arises in any number of fields, including [[insurance]], [[philosophy]], [[physics]], [[statistics]], [[economics]], [[finance]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[engineering]], [[metrology]], [[meteorology]], [[ecology]] and [[information science]].

Although the terms are used in various ways among the general public, many specialists in [[decision theory]], [[statistics]] and other quantitative fields have defined uncertainty, risk, and their measurement as:
;Uncertainty: The lack of [[certainty]], a state of limited knowledge where it is impossible to exactly describe the existing state, a future outcome, or more than one possible outcome.{{cn|date=November 2017}}
;Measurement of uncertainty: A set of possible states or outcomes where [[probabilities]] are assigned to each possible state or outcome – this also includes the application of a [[probability density function]] to continuous variables.&lt;ref&gt; Kabir, H.

;Knightian uncertainty: In economics, in 1921 [[Frank Knight]] distinguished uncertainty from risk with uncertainty being lack of knowledge which is immeasurable and impossible to calculate; this is now referred to as [[Knightian uncertainty]]:
{{quote|Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of risk, from which it has never been properly separated.... The essential fact is that 'risk' means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character; and there are far-reaching and crucial differences in the bearings of the phenomena depending on which of the two is really present and operating.... It will appear that a measurable uncertainty, or 'risk' proper, as we shall use the term, is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all.|author=[[Frank Knight]] (1885–1972)|source=''Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit'' (1921), [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=F. H. |year=1921 |title=Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit |location=Boston |publisher=Hart, Schaffner &amp; Marx }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Cquote|You cannot be certain about uncertainty.|author=Frank Knight}}

Other taxonomies of uncertainties and decisions include a broader sense of uncertainty and how it should be approached from an ethics perspective:&lt;ref name="embo1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tannert C, Elvers HD, Jandrig B |title=The ethics of uncertainty.

For example, if it is unknown whether or not it will rain tomorrow, then there is a state of uncertainty. If probabilities are applied to the possible outcomes using weather forecasts or even just a [[calibrated probability assessment]], the uncertainty has been quantified. Suppose it is quantified as a 90% chance of sunshine. If there is a major, costly, outdoor event planned for tomorrow then there is a risk since there is a 10% chance of rain, and rain would be undesirable. Furthermore, if this is a business event and $100,000 would be lost if it rains, then the risk has been quantified (a 10% chance of losing $100,000). These situations can be made even more realistic by quantifying light rain vs. heavy rain, the cost of delays vs. outright cancellation, etc.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Some may represent the risk in this example as the "expected opportunity loss" (EOL) or the chance of the loss multiplied by the amount of the loss (10% × $100,000 = $10,000). That is useful if the organizer of the event is "risk neutral", which most people are not. Most would be willing to pay a premium to avoid the loss. An insurance company, for example, would compute an EOL as a minimum for any insurance coverage, then add onto that other operating costs and profit. Since many people are willing to buy insurance for many reasons, then clearly the EOL alone is not the perceived value of avoiding the risk.

Quantitative uses of the terms uncertainty and risk are fairly consistent from fields such as [[probability theory]], [[actuarial science]], and [[information theory]]. Some also create new terms without substantially changing the definitions of uncertainty or risk. For example, [[surprisal]] is a variation on uncertainty sometimes used in [[information theory]]. But outside of the more mathematical uses of the term, usage may vary widely. In [[cognitive psychology]], uncertainty can be real, or just a matter of perception, such as [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectations]], threats, etc.

[[Vagueness]] is a form of uncertainty where the analyst is unable to clearly differentiate between two different classes, such as 'person of average height.' and 'tall person'. This form of vagueness can be modelled by some variation on [[Lotfi A. Zadeh|Zadeh]]'s [[fuzzy logic]] or [[subjective logic]]. 

[[Ambiguity]] is a form of uncertainty where even the possible outcomes have unclear meanings and interpretations. The statement &lt;i&gt;"He returns from the bank"&lt;/i&gt; is ambiguous because its interpretation depends on whether the word 'bank' is meant as &lt;i&gt;"the side of a river"&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;"a financial institution"&lt;/i&gt;. Ambiguity typically arises in situations where multiple analysts or observers have different interpretations of the same statements.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Uncertainty may be a consequence of a lack of knowledge of obtainable facts. That is, there may be uncertainty about whether a new rocket design will work, but this uncertainty can be removed with further analysis and experimentation. 

At the subatomic level, uncertainty may be a fundamental and unavoidable property of the universe. In [[quantum mechanics]], the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] puts limits on how much an observer can ever know about the position and velocity of a particle. This may not just be ignorance of potentially obtainable facts but that there is no fact to be found. There is some controversy in physics as to whether such uncertainty is an irreducible property of nature or if there are "hidden variables" that would describe the state of a particle even more exactly than Heisenberg's uncertainty principle allows.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==Measurements== &lt;!-- Heavily linked section: Standard uncertainty, Concise notation --&gt;
{{Main article|Measurement uncertainty}}
{{See also|Uncertainty quantification|Uncertainty propagation}}

The most commonly used procedure for calculating measurement uncertainty is described in the "Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement" (GUM) published by [[ISO]]. A derived work is for example the [[National Institute for Standards and Technology]] (NIST) Technical Note 1297, "Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing the Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results", and the Eurachem/Citac publication "Quantifying Uncertainty in Analytical Measurement". The uncertainty of the result of a measurement generally consists of several components. The components are regarded as [[random variables]], and may be grouped into two categories according to the method used to estimate their numerical values:
* Type A, those evaluated by [[statistical]] methods
* Type B, those evaluated by other means, e.g., by assigning a [[probability distribution]]
By propagating the [[variance]]s of the components through a function relating the components to the measurement result, the combined measurement uncertainty is given as the square root of the resulting variance. The simplest form is the [[standard deviation]] of a repeated observation.

In [[metereology]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]], the uncertainty or [[margin of error]] of a measurement, when explicitly stated, is given by a range of values likely to enclose the true value. This may be denoted by [[error bar]]s on a graph, or by the following notations:{{cn|date=November 2017}}
* ''measured value'' ± ''uncertainty''
* ''measured value'' {{su|p=+uncertainty|b=−uncertainty}}
* ''measured value'' (''uncertainty'')

{{Anchor|Shortest help for uncertainty notation}} 
In the last notation, parentheses are the concise notation for the ± notation. For example, applying 10 {{frac|1|2}} meters in a scientific or engineering application, it could be written {{val|10.5|u=m}} or {{val|10.50|u=m}}, by convention meaning accurate to ''within'' one tenth of a meter, or one hundredth. The precision is symmetric around the last digit. In this case it's half a tenth up and half a tenth down, so 10.5 means between 10.45 and 10.55. Thus it is ''understood'' that 10.5 means {{val|10.5|.05}}, and 10.50 means {{val|10.50|.005}}, also written {{val|10.50|(5)}} and {{val|10.500|(5)}} respectively.  But if the accuracy is within two tenths, the uncertainty is ± one tenth, and it is ''required'' to be explicit: {{val|10.5|.1}} and {{val|10.50|.01}} or {{val|10.5|(1)}} and {{val|10.50|(1)}}.   The numbers in parentheses ''apply'' to the numeral left of themselves, and are not part of that number, but part of a notation of uncertainty. They apply to the [[significant figure|least significant digits]]. For instance, {{val|1.00794|(7)}} stands for {{val|1.00794|0.00007}}, while {{val|1.00794|(72)}} stands for {{val|1.00794|0.00072}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Info/Constants/definitions.html|title=Standard Uncertainty and Relative Standard Uncertainty|work=[[CODATA]] reference|publisher=[[NIST]]|accessdate=26 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016021440/http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Info/Constants/definitions.html|archivedate=16 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concise notation is used for example by [[IUPAC]] in stating the [[list of elements by atomic mass|atomic mass]] of [[chemical element|elements]].

The middle notation is used when the error is not symmetrical about the value – for example {{val|3.4|+0.3|-0.2}}. This can occur when using a logarithmic scale, for example.

Uncertainty of a measurement can be determined by repeating a measurement to arrive at an estimate of the standard deviation of the values. Then, any single value has an uncertainty equal to the standard deviation. However, if the values are averaged, then the mean measurement value has a much smaller uncertainty, equal to the [[standard error (statistics)|standard error]] of the mean, which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of measurements. This procedure neglects [[systematic error]]s, however.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

When the uncertainty represents the standard error of the measurement, then about 68.3% of the time, the true value of the measured quantity falls within the stated uncertainty range. For example, it is likely that for 31.7% of the atomic mass values given on the [[list of elements by atomic mass]], the true value lies outside of the stated range. If the width of the interval is doubled, then probably only 4.6% of the true values lie outside the doubled interval, and if the width is tripled, probably only 0.3% lie outside. These values follow from the properties of the [[normal distribution]], and they apply only if the measurement process produces normally distributed errors. In that case, the quoted [[standard error (statistics)|standard errors]] are easily converted to 68.3% ("one [[sigma]]"), 95.4% ("two sigma"), or 99.7% ("three sigma") [[confidence interval]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In this context, uncertainty depends on both the [[accuracy and precision]] of the measurement instrument. The lower the accuracy and precision of an instrument, the larger the measurement uncertainty is. Notice that precision is often determined as the standard deviation of the repeated measures of a given value, namely using the same method described above to assess measurement uncertainty. However, this method is correct only when the instrument is accurate. When it is inaccurate, the uncertainty is larger than the standard deviation of the repeated measures, and it appears evident that the uncertainty does not depend only on instrumental precision.

==Uncertainty and the media==
Uncertainty in science, and science in general, may be interpreted differently in the public sphere than in the scientific community.&lt;ref name=zehr&gt;Zehr, S. C. (1999). Scientists' representation of uncertainty. In Friedman, S.M., Dunwoody, S., &amp; Rogers, C. L. (Eds.), Communicating uncertainty: Media coverage of new and controversial science (3–21). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is due in part to the diversity of the public audience, and the tendency for scientists to misunderstand lay audiences and therefore not communicate ideas clearly and effectively.&lt;ref name=zehr /&gt; One example is explained by the [[information deficit model]]. Also, in the public realm, there are often many scientific voices giving input on a single topic.&lt;ref name=zehr /&gt; For example, depending on how an issue is reported in the public sphere, discrepancies between outcomes of multiple scientific studies due to methodological differences could be interpreted by the public as a lack of consensus in a situation where a consensus does in fact exist.&lt;ref name=zehr /&gt; This interpretation may have even been intentionally promoted, as scientific uncertainty may be managed to reach certain goals.  For example, global warming contrarian activists took the advice of [[Frank Luntz]] to frame [[global warming]] as an issue of scientific uncertainty, which was a precursor to the conflict frame used by journalists when reporting the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nisbet |first=M. |last2=Scheufele |first2=D. A. |year=2009 |title=What's next for science communication? Promising directions and lingering distractions |journal=[[American Journal of Botany]] |volume=96 |issue=10 |pages=1767–1778 |doi=10.3732/ajb.0900041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Indeterminacy can be loosely said to apply to situations in which not all the parameters of the system and their interactions are fully known, whereas ignorance refers to situations in which it is not known what is not known."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shackley |first=S. |last2=Wynne |first2=B. |year=1996 |title=Representing uncertainty in global climate change science and policy: Boundary-ordering devices and authority |journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=275–302 |doi=10.1177/016224399602100302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These unknowns, indeterminacy and ignorance, that exist in science are often "transformed" into uncertainty when reported to the public in order to make issues more manageable, since scientific indeterminacy and ignorance are difficult concepts for scientists to convey without losing credibility.&lt;ref name=zehr /&gt; Conversely, uncertainty is often interpreted by the public as ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Somerville |first=R. C. |last2=Hassol |first2=S. J. |year=2011 |title=Communicating the science of climate change |journal=[[Physics Today]] |volume= 64|issue= |pages=48–53 | doi = 10.1063/pt.3.1296 |bibcode=2011PhT....64j..48S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation of indeterminacy and ignorance into uncertainty may be related to the public's misinterpretation of uncertainty as ignorance.

Journalists may inflate uncertainty (making the science seem more uncertain than it really is) or downplay uncertainty (making the science seem more certain than it really is).&lt;ref name=stocking&gt;{{cite book |last=Stocking |first=H. |year=1999 |chapter=How journalists deal with scientific uncertainty |editor1-last=Friedman |editor1-first=S. M. |editor2-last=Dunwoody |editor2-first=S. |editor3-last=Rogers |editor3-first=C. L. |title=Communicating Uncertainty: Media Coverage of New and Controversial Science |pages=23–41 |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |isbn=0-8058-2727-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way that journalists inflate uncertainty is by describing new research that contradicts past research without providing context for the change.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; Journalists may give scientists with minority views equal weight as scientists with majority views, without adequately describing or explaining the state of [[scientific consensus]] on the issue.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; In the same vein, journalists may give non-scientists the same amount of attention and importance as scientists.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt;

Journalists may downplay uncertainty by eliminating "scientists' carefully chosen tentative wording, and by losing these caveats the information is skewed and presented as more certain and conclusive than it really is".&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; Also, stories with a single source or without any context of previous research mean that the subject at hand is presented as more definitive and certain than it is in reality.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; There is often a "product over process" approach to [[science journalism]] that aids, too, in the downplaying of uncertainty.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; Finally, and most notably for this investigation, when science is framed by journalists as a triumphant quest, uncertainty is erroneously framed as "reducible and resolvable".&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt;

Some media routines and organizational factors affect the overstatement of uncertainty; other media routines and organizational factors help inflate the certainty of an issue. Because the general public (in the United States) generally trusts scientists, when science stories are covered without alarm-raising cues from special interest organizations (religious groups, environmental organizations, political factions, etc.) they are often covered in a business related sense, in an economic-development frame or a social progress frame.&lt;ref name=nisbet&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nisbet |first=M. |last2=Scheufele |first2=D. A. |year=2007 |title=The Future of Public Engagement |journal=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]] |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=38–44 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of these frames is to downplay or eliminate uncertainty, so when economic and scientific promise are focused on early in the issue cycle, as has happened with coverage of plant biotechnology and nanotechnology in the United States, the matter in question seems more definitive and certain.&lt;ref name=nisbet /&gt;

Sometimes, stockholders, owners, or advertising will pressure a media organization to promote the business aspects of a scientific issue, and therefore any uncertainty claims which may compromise the business interests are downplayed or eliminated.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt;

==Applications==
* Uncertainty is designed into [[game]]s, most notably in [[gambling]], where [[probability|chance]] is central to play.
* In [[scientific modelling]], in which the prediction of future events should be understood to have a range of expected values
* In [[optimization]], uncertainty permits one to describe situations where the user does not have full control on the final outcome of the optimization procedure, see [[scenario optimization]] and [[stochastic optimization]]. 
** In [[meteorology|weather forecasting]], it is now commonplace to include data on the degree of uncertainty in a [[weather forecast]].
* Uncertainty or [[error]] is used in science and engineering notation. Numerical values should only be expressed to those digits that are physically meaningful, which are referred to as [[significant figures]]. Uncertainty is involved in every measurement, such as measuring a distance, a temperature, etc., the degree depending upon the instrument or technique used to make the measurement. Similarly, uncertainty is propagated through calculations so that the calculated value has some degree of uncertainty depending upon the uncertainties of the measured values and the equation used in the calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gregory |first=Kent J. |last2=Bibbo |first2=Giovanni |last3=Pattison |first3=John E. |year=2005 |title=A Standard Approach to Measurement Uncertainties for Scientists and Engineers in Medicine |journal=Australasian Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=131–139 |doi=10.1007/BF03178705 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[physics]], the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]] forms the basis of modern [[quantum mechanics]].
* In [[metrology]], [[measurement uncertainty]] is a central concept quantifying the dispersion one may reasonably attribute to a measurement result. Such an uncertainty can also be referred to as a measurement [[error]]. In daily life, measurement uncertainty is often implicit ("He is 6 feet tall" give or take a few inches), while for any serious use an explicit statement of the measurement uncertainty is necessary. The expected measurement uncertainty of many [[measuring instruments]] (scales, oscilloscopes, force gages, rulers, thermometers, etc.) is often stated in the manufacturers' specifications.
* In [[engineering]], uncertainty can be used in the context of validation and verification of material modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Category:Uncertainty |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926183351/https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Category:Uncertainty |archivedate=2015-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Uncertainty has been a common theme in art, both as a thematic device (see, for example, the indecision of [[Hamlet]]), and as a quandary for the artist (such as [[Martin Creed]]'s difficulty with deciding what artworks to make).
* Uncertainty is an important factor in [[economics]]. According to economist [[Frank Knight]], it is different from [[risk]], where there is a specific [[probability]] assigned to each outcome (as when flipping a fair coin). Knightian uncertainty involves a situation that has unknown probabilities.
** Investing in [[financial market]]s such as the stock market involves Knightian uncertainty when the probabiliy of a rare but catastrophic event is unknown.
** In [[entrepreneurship]]: New products, services, firms and even markets may be created in the absence of probability estimates. According to entrepreneurship research, expert entrepreneurs use{{since when|date=November 2017}} experience based [[heuristics]] called [[effectuation]] (as opposed to [[causality]]) to overcome uncertainty.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

{{War}}

'''War''' is a state of armed conflict between [[State (polity)|states]], [[government]]s, [[Society|societies]] and informal [[paramilitary]] groups, such as [[mercenaries]], [[insurgent]]s and [[militia]]s. It is generally characterized by extreme [[violence]], [[aggression]], destruction, and mortality, using [[Regular army|regular]] or [[Irregular military|irregular]] [[military forces]]. '''Warfare''' refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warfare|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/warfare|website=Cambridge Dictionary|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Total war]] is warfare that is not restricted to purely [[legitimate military target]]s, and can result in massive [[civilian casualties|civilian]] or other [[non-combatant]] suffering and [[Casualty (person)|casualties]].

The [[war studies|scholarly study of war]] is sometimes called polemology ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɒ|l|ə|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}} {{Respell|POL|ə|MOL|ə|jee}}), from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''polemos'', meaning "war", and ''[[-logy]]'', meaning "the study of".

While some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of [[human nature]],&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'',  p. 67, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural or ecological circumstances.&lt;ref name="Sage Publications"&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2006 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Friedman | first2= Jonathan | title= Globalization and Violence, Vol. 3: Globalizing War and Intervention | url= https://www.academia.edu/3587732 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Gari-Melchers-War-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Mural of War (1896), by [[Gari Melchers]]]]
The English word ''war'' derives from the late [[Old English]] (circa.1050) words ''wyrre'' and ''werre'', from [[Old French]] ''werre'' (also ''guerre'' as in modern French), in turn from the [[Franks|Frankish]] *''werra'', ultimately deriving from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''werzō'' 'mixture, confusion'. The word is related to the [[Old Saxon]] ''werran'', [[Old High German]] ''werran'', and the German ''verwirren'', meaning “to confuse”, “to perplex”, and “to bring into confusion”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=war |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=war |year=2010 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{Main|Outline of war#Types of war|l1=Types of war}}

War must entail some degree of confrontation using weapons and other [[military technology and equipment]] by armed forces employing [[military tactics]] and [[operational art]] within a broad [[military strategy]] subject to [[military logistics]]. Studies of war by military theorists throughout [[military history]] have sought to identify the [[philosophy of war]], and to reduce it to a [[military science]]. Modern military science considers several factors before a [[Defence policy|national defence policy]] is created to allow a war to commence: the environment in the area(s) of combat operations, the posture national forces will adopt on the commencement of a war, and the type of warfare troops will be engaged in.
* [[Asymmetric warfare]] is a conflict between [[belligerent]]s of drastically different levels of military capability and/or size.
* [[Biological warfare]], or germ warfare, is the use of weaponized biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
* [[Chemical warfare]] involves the use of weaponized chemicals in combat. Poison gas as a [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] was principally used during [[World War I]], and resulted in over a million estimated casualties, including more than 100,000 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents, Second Edition |author=D. Hank Ellison |date=August 24, 2007 |pages=567–70 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-0-8493-1434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Guernica]] (1937). The [[Spanish Civil War]] was one of Europe's bloodiest and most brutal civil wars.]]
* [[Civil war]] is a war between forces belonging to the same nation or political entity.
* [[Conventional warfare]] is declared war between states in which [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[biological weapon|biological]], or [[chemical weapons]] are not used or see limited deployment.
* [[Cyberwarfare]] involves the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's information systems.
* [[Insurgency]] is a rebellion against authority, when those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents (lawful combatants). An insurgency can be fought via counter-insurgency warfare, and may also be opposed by measures to protect the population, and by political and economic actions of various kinds aimed at undermining the insurgents' claims against the incumbent regime.
* [[Information warfare]] is the application of destructive force on a large scale against information assets and systems, against the [[computer]]s and [[Computer network|networks]] that support the four critical infrastructures (the power grid, communications, financial, and transportation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/eprint/snyder/infowarfare.htm |title=Information Warfare |last=Lewis |first=Brian C. |date= |website=Federation of American Scientist |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970617035106/http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/snyder/infowarfare.htm |archive-date=17 June 1997 |dead-url=yes |access-date=27 Feb 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nuclear warfare]] is warfare in which [[nuclear weapon]]s are the primary, or a major, method of achieving capitulation.
* [[Total war]] is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the [[laws of war]], placing no limits on [[legitimate military target]]s, using [[weapon]]s and [[Military tactics|tactics]] resulting in significant [[civilian casualties]], or demanding a [[war effort]] requiring significant sacrifices by the friendly civilian population.
* [[Unconventional warfare]], the opposite of conventional warfare, is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence, capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict.
* [[War of aggression]] is a war for conquest or gain rather than self-defense; this can be the basis of [[war crime]]s under [[customary international law]].
* [[War of liberation]], Wars of national liberation or national liberation revolutions are conflicts fought by nations to gain independence. The term is used in conjunction with wars against foreign powers (or at least those perceived as foreign) to establish separate sovereign states for the rebelling nationality. From a different point of view, these wars are called insurgencies, rebellions, or wars of independence.

[[File:War deaths caused by warfare.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|The percentages of men killed in war in eight tribal societies, and Europe and the U.S. in the 20th century. (Lawrence H. Keeley, archeologist)]]
The earliest recorded evidence of war belongs to the Mesolithic cemetery [[Site 117]], which has been determined to be approximately 14,000 years old. About forty-five percent of the skeletons there displayed signs of violent death.&lt;ref name="Keeley page 37"&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H: ''War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage''. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the rise of the [[State (polity)|state]] some 5,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared, ''Guns, Germs and Steel''&lt;/ref&gt; military activity has occurred over much of the globe. The advent of [[gunpowder]] and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. According to Conway W. Henderson, ''"One source claims that 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (Beer 1981: 20)."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Conway W.

Jongman &amp; J.M.G. van der Dennen, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150415132823/http://rint.rechten.rug.nl/rth/dennen/hoax.htm 'The Great "War Figures" Hoax: an investigation in polemomythology']&lt;/ref&gt; mentions the following regarding one of the proponents of this estimate: "In addition, perhaps feeling that the war casualties figure was improbably high, he changed "approximately 3,640,000,000 human beings have been killed by war or the diseases produced by war" to "approximately 1,240,000,000 human beings...&amp;c."" The lower figure is more plausible,&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Muehlenkamp, [http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/germs-vs-guns-or-death-from-mass.html 'Germs vs. guns, or death from mass violence in perspective']&lt;/ref&gt; but could also be on the high side, considering that the 100 deadliest acts of mass violence between 480 BCE and 2002 CE (wars and other man-made disasters with at least 300,000 and up to 66 million victims) claimed about 455 million human lives in total.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew White, ''Atrocitology: Humanity's 100 Deadliest Achievements'', Canongate Books Ltd. (20 October 2011), {{ISBN|0857861220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitive warfare is estimated to have accounted for 15.1 % of deaths and claimed 400 million victims.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew White, [http://necrometrics.com/pre1700b.htm#Primitive 'Primitive War']&lt;/ref&gt; Added to the aforementioned (and perhaps too high) figure of 1,240 million between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, this would mean a total of 1,640,000,000 people killed by war (including deaths from famine and disease caused by war) throughout the history and pre-history of mankind. For comparison, an estimated 1,680,000,000 people died from infectious diseases in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;David McCandless, [http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/20th-century-death '20th Century Death']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nuclear warfare]] breaking out in August 1988, when nuclear arsenals were at peak level, and the aftermath thereof, could have reduced human population from 5,150,000,000 by 1,850,000,000 to 3,300,000,000 within a period of about one year, according to a projection that did not consider "the most severe predictions concerning [[nuclear winter]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wm. Robert Johnston, [http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/nuclearwar1.html 'The Effects of a Global Thermonuclear War']&lt;/ref&gt; This would have been a proportional reduction of the world’s population exceeding the reduction caused in the 14th century by the [[Black Death]], and comparable in proportional terms with the plague’s impact on Europe's population in 1346–53.

In ''[[War Before Civilization]]'', Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], says approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brneurosci.org/reviews/war.html |title=Review: War Before Civilization |publisher=Brneurosci.org |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=2011-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121021158/http://brneurosci.org/reviews/war.html |archivedate=21 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many fought constantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/HG04Aa02.html|title=The fraud of primitive authenticity|last=Spengler|date=4 July 2006|work=Asia Times Online|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Debra L., Ryan P. Harrod, and Ventura R. Pérez, eds. 2012. ''The Bioarchaeology of Violence''. Gainesville: University Press of Florida. http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=MARTI002&lt;/ref&gt; Keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants did not have any formal training. Scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost-effective way to protect the society against enemy raids.&lt;ref name="Keeley page 55"&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H: ''War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage''. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Rubinstein]] wrote "Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty...'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [i.e., after the coming of the Europeans].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W.

[[File:MokoShuraiE-Kotoba IV.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Japanese [[samurai]] attacking a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ship, 13th century]]
In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place.&lt;ref name="War"&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/CG/world-war-one2.html World War One – A New Kind of War | Part II], From ''14 – 18 Understanding the Great War'', by Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, war resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and was a crucial catalyst for the emergence of the Left as a force to be reckoned with.&lt;ref name = "Kolko 1994 xviitoxviii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolko|1994|p=xvii–xviii}}: "War in this century became an essential precondition for the emergence of a numerically powerful Left, moving it from the margins to the very center of European politics during 1917–18 and of all world affairs after 1941".&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent rapid increases in the technologies of war, and therefore in its destructiveness (see [[mutual assured destruction]]), have caused widespread public concern, and have in all probability forestalled, and may altogether prevent the outbreak of a nuclear [[World War III]]. At the end of each of the last two World Wars, concerted and popular efforts were made to come to a greater understanding of the underlying dynamics of war and to thereby hopefully reduce or even eliminate it altogether. These efforts materialized in the forms of the [[League of Nations]], and its successor, the United Nations.

In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed [[atom bomb]], [[Albert Einstein]] famously stated, "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."&lt;ref name="EinsteinWWIV"&gt;{{cite web|year=1947 |url=http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/action/urgent-actions/einstein/ |title=Albert Einstein: Man of Imagination |accessdate=2010-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604080636/http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/action/urgent-actions/einstein/ |archivedate=4 June 2010 }} Nuclear Age Peace Foundation paper

[[Mao Zedong]] urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the United States since, even if "half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Instant Wisdom: Beyond the Little Red Book |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946612-2,00.html |date= 20 September 1976 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate= 14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Security Report 2005]] documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the [[Cold War]] in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management's "Peace and Conflict" study indicated the overall decline in conflicts had stalled.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Joseph, J.

Human history had numerous wars coming and going, but the average number of people dying from war has fluctuated relatively little, being about 1 to 10 people dying per 100,000. However, major wars over shorter periods have resulted in much higher casualty rates, with 100-200 casualties per 100,000 over a few years. While conventional wisdom holds that casualties have increased in recent times due to technological improvements in warfare, this is not generally true. For instance, the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648) had about the same number of casualties per capita as [[World War I]], although it was higher during [[World War II]] (WWII). That said, overall the number of casualties from war has not significantly increased in recent times. Quite to the contrary, on a global scale the time since WWII has been unusually peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace/|title=War and Peace|work=Our World in Data|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Largest by death toll===
{{Main|List of wars by death toll|Outline of war#Wars}}
The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is [[World War II]], from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the [[Mongol conquests]]&lt;ref&gt;*The Cambridge History of China: Alien regimes and border states, 907–1368, 1994, p. 622, cited by White
&lt;br /&gt;*Matthew White (2011-11-07). The Great Big Book of Horrible Things: The Definitive Chronicle of History's 100 Worst Atrocities.&lt;/ref&gt; at up to 60 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in [[modern history]] may have been the [[Paraguayan War]] (see [[Paraguayan War casualties]]). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmc=4340604|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Richard Smalley]] identified war as the sixth biggest problem (out of ten) facing humanity for the next fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;"Top Ten Problems of Humanity for Next 50 Years", Professor R. E. Smalley, Energy &amp; NanoTechnology Conference, Rice University, May 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, [[famine]], large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] or civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tanton|first1=John|title=The Social Contract|date=2002|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=John|title=The pursuit of happiness|date=1992|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baxter|first1=Richard|title=Humanizing the Laws of War|date=2013|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]] in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians).&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Snyder, ''Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin'', Basic Books, 2010, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of [[propaganda]] by some or all parties in the conflict,&lt;ref&gt;''Dying and Death: Inter-disciplinary Perspectives''.  p. 153, Asa Kasher (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and increased revenues by [[weapons manufacturers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chew|first1=Emry|title=Arming the Periphery|date=2012|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (which is sometimes considered part of [[World War II]], or as overlapping). Most of the others involved China or neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being over 60 million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls.&lt;ref name="users.erols"&gt;McFarlane, Alan: ''The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap'', Blackwell 2003, {{ISBN|0-631-18117-2}},

===On military personnel===
[[Military personnel]] subject to combat in war often suffer mental and physical injuries, including depression, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], disease, injury, and death.

{{Quote|In every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life – were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire.|''No More Heroes'', Richard Gabriel&lt;ref name="War"/&gt;}}

During World War II, research conducted by [[US Army]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[S.L.A. Marshall]] found, on average, 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the enemy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lt. Col. Dave Grossman|title=On Killing – The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War &amp; Society|publisher= Little, Brown &amp; Co., |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Civil War Collector’s Encyclopedia, F.A. Lord notes that of the 27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times. These studies suggest most military personnel resist firing their weapons in combat, that – as some theorists argue – human beings have an inherent resistance to killing their fellow human beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt; Swank and Marchand’s WWII study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt;

[[United States military casualties of war]] since 1775 have totaled over two million.

Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as [[genocide]], while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war.

Most estimates of [[World War II casualties]] indicate around 60 million people died, 40 million of which were civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II Fatalities|url=http://www.secondworldwar.co.uk/casualty.html|accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deaths in the [[Soviet Union]] were around [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|27 million]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4530565.stm|title=Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead | date=9 May 2005 | accessdate=6 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a high proportion of those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children, population growth in the postwar Soviet Union was much lower than it otherwise would have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Geoffrey A. |last=Hosking|title=Rulers And Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDMVMqDvp4QC&amp;pg=PA242|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02178-5|pages=242–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the economy===
{{see also|Military Keynesianism}}

Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay [[war reparations]] to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons. Some economists{{who|date=July 2016}} believe war can stimulate a country's economy (high government spending for World War II is often credited with bringing the U.S. out of the [[Great Depression]] by most [[Keynesian]] economists) but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and [[World War I]], warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gatrell|first1=Peter|title=Russia's First World War : A Social and Economic History|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781317881391|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the arts===
War leads to [[forced migration]] causing potentially large displacements of population. Among forced migrants there are usually relatively large shares of artists and other types of creative people, causing so the war effects to be particularly harmful for the country’s creative potential in the long-run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jan Borowiecki | first1 = Karol | year = 2012 | title = Are composers different?

In war, cultural institutions, such as libraries, can become "targets in themselves; their elimination was a way to denigrate and demoralize the enemy population." The impact such destruction can have on a society is important because "in an era in which competing ideologies fuel internal and international conflict, the destruction of libraries and other items of cultural significance is neither random nor irrelevant. Preserving the world’s repositories of knowledge is crucial to ensuring that the darkest moments of history do not endlessly repeat themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, K. (2007).

==Aims==

Entities deliberately contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to end a war may formulate ''war aims'' as an evaluation/propaganda tool. War aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Classification ===

Tangible/intangible aims:
* Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of territory (as in the German goal of [[Lebensraum]] in the first half of the 20th century) or the recognition of economic concessions (as in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]).
* Intangible war aims – like the accumulation of credibility or reputation&lt;ref&gt;
Welch distinguishes: "tangible goods such as arms, wealth, and – provided they are strategically or economically valuable – territory and resources" from "intangible goods such as credibility and reputation" – {{cite book

==Limiting and stopping==
[[File:Washington March15 2003-02.jpg|thumb|Anti-war rally in Washington, D.C., March 15, 2003]]
{{main|Anti-war movement}}
{{See also|Aestheticization of violence}}

Religious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as in the [[Second Vatican Council]] document ''Gaudiem et Spes'': "Any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas along with their population is a crime against God and man himself. It merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html PASTORAL CONSTITUTION ON THE CHURCH IN THE MODERN WORLD GAUDIUM ET SPES PROMULGATED BY HIS HOLINESS, POPE PAUL VI ON DECEMBER 7, 1965]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in response to the United States [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Protests [[Opposition to the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|opposing the War in Afghanistan]] occurred in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Organizations like [[Stop the War Coalition]], based in the United Kingdom, worked on campaigning against the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop the War Coalition: Timeline of Events 2001–2011 |url=http://stopwar.org.uk/index.php/about/timeline-of-stop-the-war-events-2001-2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530053507/http://www.stopwar.org.uk/index.php/about/timeline-of-stop-the-war-events-2001-2011 |archivedate=30 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It won the recognition of President Calderon, who began war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Calderon apologizes to drug war victims |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2011/06/20116244495608277.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of motivation==
[[File:Szigetvar 1566.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[List of campaigns of Suleiman the Magnificent|Ottoman campaign]] for territorial [[Ottoman wars in Europe|expansion in Europe]] in 1566]]
There are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus about which are most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy |first=Jack S. |year=1989 |title=The Causes of War: A Review of Theories and Evidence |journal=Behavior, Society and Nuclear War |volume=I |page=295 |editor1-first=Philip E. |editor1-last=Tetlock |editor2-first=Jo L. |editor2-last=Husbands |editor3-first=Robert |editor3-last=Jervis |editor4-first=Paul C. |editor4-last=Stern |editor5-first=Charles |editor5-last=Tilly |accessdate=4 May 2012 |url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1989%20Causes%20of%20War.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922150721/http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1989%20Causes%20of%20War.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl von Clausewitz]] said, 'Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.'&lt;ref&gt;Clausewitz, Carl Von (1976), ''On War'' (Princeton University Press) p. 593&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoanalytic===
Dutch psychoanalyst [[Joost Meerloo]] held that, "War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction."&lt;ref name = "meerloo"&gt;
| A. M. Meerloo, M.D. ''The Rape of the Mind'' (2009) p. 134, Progressive Press, {{ISBN|978-1-61577-376-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus war can sometimes be a means by which man's own frustration at his inability to master his own self is expressed and temporarily relieved via his unleashing of destructive behavior upon ''others.'' In this destructive scenario, these ''others'' are made to serve as the scapegoat of unspoken and subconscious frustrations and fears.

Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and [[John Bowlby]] have argued human beings are [[Inheritance|inherently]] violent.&lt;ref&gt;Durbin, E.F.L. and John Bowlby. ''Personal Aggressiveness and War'' 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; This aggressiveness is fueled by [[displacement (psychology)|displacement]] and [[Psychological projection|projection]] where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other [[race (human classification)|races]], religions, nations or [[Ideology|ideologies]]. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.

The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of [[Melanie Klein]], thought war was the paranoid or projective “elaboration” of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;(Fornari 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our “love need”: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.

Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. "The Origin of Great Wars." ''The Origins of the French Revolutionary Wars.'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Maurice N. ''War and the Human Race.'' 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek war such as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.

{{Quotation|Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.|

Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and [[competition]] over resources; the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meyer. Social Evolution in Franz M. Wuketits and Christoph Antweiler (eds.) Handbook of Evolution The Evolution of Human Societies and Cultures Wiley-VCH Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as [[chimpanzee]]s,&lt;ref name = "ApesWar"&gt;{{cite news

Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states.&lt;ref&gt;Johan M.G. van der Dennen. 1995. ''The Origin of War: Evolution of a Male-Coalitional Reproductive Strategy''. Origin Press, Groningen, 1995 chapters 1 &amp; 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist and linguist [[Steven Pinker]] argued that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Pinker |url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |title=Steven Pinker – Books – The Blank Slate |publisher=Pinker.wjh.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510091413/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |archivedate=2011-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}  He also argued that in order to have credible [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation ("[[honor]]").{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Crofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which "coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups", is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking "tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors".&lt;ref name="HumanPrimateAggression"&gt;''Mind the Gap: Tracing the Origins of Human Universals'' By Peter M. Kappeler, Joan B. Silk, 2009, Chapter 8, "Intergroup Aggression in Primates and Humans; The Case for a Unified Theory", Margaret C. Crofoot and Richard W. Wrangham&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashley Montagu]] strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies.&lt;ref&gt;Montagu, Ashley (1976), ''The Nature of Human Aggression'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Montagu's argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g. the [[Chewong]] and [[Semai people|Semai]] of the Malay peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Signe and Roy Willis, eds. (1989) ''Societies at Peace: Anthropological Perspectives''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Bobbi S. Low has observed correlation between warfare and education, noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/eugene.burnstein/files/35._low_93_evolutionaryperspective_war.pdf "An Evolutionary Perspective on War"], Bobbi S.

===Economic===
[[File:Disabled Iraqi T-54A, T-55, Type 59 or Type 69 tank and burning Kuwaiti oil field.jpg|thumb|Kuwaiti [[oil well]]s on fire, during the [[Gulf War]], 1 March 1991]]
War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for [[natural resource]]s and for wealth. War has also been linked to [[economic development]] by economic historians and development economists studying [[state-building]] and [[fiscal capacity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Noel D.|last2=Koyama|first2=Mark|date=2015|title=States and Economic Growth: Capacity and Constraints|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/md0bpim4r69d5eq/State%20Capacity%20Survey%2010-5-15%20Draft.pdf?dl=0|journal=George Mason University WORKING PAPER|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme [[right (politics)|right]] of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Griffin]] and Matthew Feldman, eds., ''Fascism: Fascism and Culture'', New York: [[Routledge]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Mike. ''[[Social Darwinism]] in European and American Thought, 1860–1945: Nature as Model and Nature as Threat'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including [[Presidents of the United States]] and U.S. [[General officer|Generals]], expressed support for an economic view of war.

===Marxist===
The [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great ([[Imperialism|imperialist]]) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the [[free market]] and [[Social class|class system]]. Part of the theory is that war will disappear once a [[world revolution]], over-throwing free markets and class systems, has occurred. Marxist philosopher [[Rosa Luxemburg]] theorized that [[imperialism]] was the result of capitalist countries needing new [[Market (economics)|markets]]. Expansion of the [[means of production]] is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in [[consumer demand]]. Since the workers in a [[capitalist economy]] would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1955/08/imp-crit.html |title=The Marxist Theory of Imperialism and its Critics |first=Einde |last=O'Callaghan |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Clash of Civilizations|Clash of Civilizations]] --&gt;

Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian and youth bulge theories:

====Malthusian====
[[File:Aerial view of a US helicopter as it flies over a Mogadishu residential area.JPEG|thumb|right|U.S. Marine helicopter on patrol in Somalia as part of the [[Unified Task Force]], 1992]]
[[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian theories]] see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.

[[Pope Urban II]] in 1095, on the eve of the [[First Crusade]], spoke:
{{quote|For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lend me your ears: great speeches in history |first=William |last=Safire |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-393-05931-1 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or [[famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geography: an integrated approach |first=David |last=Waugh |publisher=[[Nelson Thornes]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-17-444706-1 |page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Youth bulge====
[[File:2017 world map, median age by country.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Population pyramid|Median age]] by country. War reduces life expectancy. A youth bulge is evident for [[Demographics of Africa|Africa]], and to a lesser extent in some countries in West Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Central America.]]

According to Heinsohn, who proposed [[youth bulge]] theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the "fighting age" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with [[total fertility rate]]s as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay.&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson, John L. (2002): "The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Trends"[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cia/helgerson2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinsohn, G. (2006): "Demography and War" [https://de.scribd.com/doc/310263543/Gunnar-Heinsohn-Demography-and-War (online)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinsohn saw both past "Christianist" European colonialism and imperialism, as well as today's Islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.&lt;ref&gt;Heinsohn, G. (2005): "Population, Conquest and Terror in the 21st Century" [https://de.scribd.com/doc/310265022/Gunnar-Heinsohn-Population-Conquest-and-Terror-in-the-21st-Century (online)]&lt;/ref&gt; Among prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including the [[French Revolution]] of 1789,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack A. Goldstone|title=Revolution and Rebellion in the Early Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-T9dR7nWDUC|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=4 March 1993|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08267-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effect of economic depression upon the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Moller, Herbert (1968): ‘Youth as a Force in the Modern World’, ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 10: 238–60; 240–44&lt;/ref&gt; The 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]] has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge.&lt;ref&gt;Diessenbacher, Hartmut (1994): ''Kriege der Zukunft: Die Bevölkerungsexplosion gefährdet den Frieden''.

===Rationalist===
[[File:LRPs directing artillery.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. soldiers directing artillery on enemy trucks in A Shau Valley, April 1968]]
[[Rationalism (international relations)|Rationalism]] is an [[international relations theory]] or framework. Rationalism (and [[Neorealism (international relations)]]) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Rationalist Explanations for War|last = Fearon|first = James D.|date = Summer 1995|journal = International Organization |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=379–414|doi = 10.1017/s0020818300033324|pmid = |jstor=2706903}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under a [[game theory]] approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. In "Rationalist Explanations for War", [[James Fearon]] examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war:
* Issue indivisibilities
* Incentives to misrepresent or [[information asymmetry]]
* Commitment problems&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"Issue indivisibility" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other.

[[File:U.S. Marines in Operation Allen Brook (Vietnam War) 001.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Marines direct a concentration of fire at the enemy, Vietnam, 8 May 1968]]
"[[Information asymmetry]] with incentives to misrepresent" occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state's victory or loss. For instance, [[Geoffrey Blainey]] argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, "war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Blainey|title=Causes of War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mcknp3tt0LMC&amp;pg=PA114|year=1988|edition=3rd|page=114|accessdate=2016-03-19|isbn=9780029035917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Powell | first1 = Robert | year = 2002 | title = Bargaining Theory and International Conflict | url = | journal = Annual Review of Political Science | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of [[cognitive bias]],&lt;ref&gt;Chris Cramer, 'Civil War is Not a Stupid Thing', {{ISBN|978-1850658214}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are still "as rational as you and me".&lt;ref&gt;From point 10 of [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think (article)], accessed 16 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to philosopher [[Iain King]], "Most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury...."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from [[Iain King]], in [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think]&lt;/ref&gt;  King asserts that "Most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in [[GroupThink]]" which is faulty, but still rational.&lt;ref&gt;Point 6 in [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under debate. The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lake|first1=David A.|title=Two Cheers for Bargaining Theory: Assessing Rationalist Explanations of the Iraq War|journal=International Security|date=November 2010|pages=7–52|doi=10.1162/isec_a_00029|volume=35|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political science===
The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] following [[World War I]]. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the [[Correlates of War]] Project, Peter Brecke and the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal, and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first proposed by [[Kenneth Waltz]] in ''[[Man, the State, and War]]'' and has been often used by political scientists since then.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|143}}

====System-level====

There are several different [[international relations theory]] schools. Supporters of [[realism in international relations]] argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the [[security dilemma]].&lt;ref name=Levy1998&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Jack S.|title=The Causes of War and the Conditions of Peace|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=Jun 1998|volume=1|pages=139–65|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.1.1.139|url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1998%20causes%20of%20war%20%26%20conditions%20of%20peace.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TXiBeznJ?url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1998%20causes%20of%20war%20%26%20conditions%20of%20peace.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145}}

Within the realist school as represented by scholars such as [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]], and the [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealist]] school represented by scholars such as [[Kenneth Waltz]] and [[John Mearsheimer]], two main sub-theories are:
# [[Balance of power (international relations)|Balance of power]] theory: States have the goal of preventing a single state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the would-be hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition. In this view, an international system with more equal distribution of power is more stable, and "movements toward unipolarity are destabilizing."&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|147}} However, evidence has shown power [[Polarity (international relations)|polarity]] is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of wars.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|147–48}}
# [[Power transition theory]]: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on the world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to preemptively suppress them.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|148}} On this view, unlike for balance-of-power theory, wars become ''more'' probable when power is more equally distributed. This "power preponderance" hypothesis has empirical support.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|148}}
The two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|148}}

[[Liberalism (international relations)|Liberalism]] as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations.  Realists{{who|date=July 2016}} respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|149}} Furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency may escalate tensions and lead to conflict.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|150}} Empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests countries at war don't necessarily trade less with each other.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|150}}

====Societal-level====
* [[Diversionary foreign policy|Diversionary theory]], also known as the "scapegoat hypothesis", suggests the politically powerful may use war to as a diversion or to rally domestic popular support.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|152}} This is supported by literature showing out-group hostility [[Realistic conflict theory|enhances]] in-group [[Group cohesiveness|bonding]], and a significant domestic "rally effect" has been demonstrated when conflicts begin.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|152–13}} However, studies examining the increased use of force as a function of need for internal political support are more mixed.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|152–53}} U.S. war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent U.S. leaders have supported diversionary theory.&lt;ref name="MilitaryAdventurism"&gt;{{cite web| year = 2001| url = http://www.bepress.com/peps/vol7/iss3/3/| title = Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy (p. 19)| accessdate = 2010-02-07| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110707224412/http://www.bepress.com/peps/vol7/iss3/3/| archivedate = 7 July 2011| df = dmy-all}} More recently studies (Lebow 2008, Lindemann 2010) demonstrated that striving for self-esteem (i.e. virile self images), and recognition as a Great Power or non-recognition (exclusion and punishment of great powers, denying traumatic historical events) is a principal cause of international conflict and war.
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individual-level====

These theories suggest differences in people's personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|157}} For instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by [[bounded rationality]] and various [[cognitive biases]],&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|157}} such as [[prospect theory]].&lt;ref name=Levy1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Jack S.|title=Prospect Theory, Rational Choice, and International Relations|journal=International Studies Quarterly|date=Mar 1997|volume=41|issue=1|pages=87–112|url=http://www.ou.edu/uschina/texts/Levy.97.ISQ.ProspectTheory.pdf|doi=10.1111/0020-8833.00034|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075824/http://www.ou.edu/uschina/texts/Levy.97.ISQ.ProspectTheory.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
[[File:Morgen nach der Schlacht967b.jpg|thumb|''Morning after the [[Battle of Waterloo]]'', by [[John Heaviside Clark]], 1816]]

The [[morality]] of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="DeForrest"&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest |first=Mark Edward |title=Conclusion |url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26/ |website=JUST WAR THEORY AND THE RECENT U.S. AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ |publisher=Gonzaga Journal of International Law |accessdate=August 1, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402204812/http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26 |archivedate=2 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the [[just war theory]], are ''[[jus ad bellum]]'' and ''[[Jus in bello]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest |first=Mark Edward |title=GENERALLY RECOGNIZED PRINCIPLES OF JUST WAR THEORY |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jus ad bellum'' (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Part II, Question 40|url=http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Texts/Aquinas/JustWar.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020212080058/http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Texts/Aquinas/JustWar.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 12, 2002|website=The Summa Theologica|publisher=Benziger Bros. edition, 1947|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosley|first=Alexander|title=The Jus Ad Bellum Convention|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|website=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jus in bello]]'' (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting war. The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered.&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|title=The Principles Of Jus In Bello|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|website=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.&lt;ref name="Moseley"/&gt; Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent.&lt;ref name="Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304"&gt;{{cite book|last=Codevilla, Seabury|first=Angelo, Paul|title=War: Ends and Means|year=1989|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-465-09067-9|page=304|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157488610X/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0465090672&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0144DHEVCX1XCVMJXAZQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both. Social Darwinism asserts that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so civilization can flourish. These are broad [[archetypes]] for the general position that [[the ends justify the means]]. Lewis Coser, U.S. conflict theorist and sociologist, argued conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created. Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society.&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "Sociological and Criminological Theory: Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms," ''CFM Research'', Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ātman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|t|m|ən}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means inner [[self]] or [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;'''[a]''' [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/atman Atman], Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press (2012), '''Quote''': "1. real self of the individual; 2. a person's soul";&lt;br&gt;'''[b]''' John Bowker (2000), The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0192800947}}, See entry for Atman;&lt;br&gt;'''[c]''' WJ Johnson (2009), A Dictionary of Hinduism, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198610250}}, See entry for Atman (self).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=davidlorenzenatman&gt;David Lorenzen (2004), The Hindu World (Editors: Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415215277}}, pages 208-209, '''Quote''': "Advaita and nirguni movements, on the other hand, stress an interior mysticism in which the devotee seeks to discover the identity of individual soul (atman) with the universal ground of being (brahman) or to find god within himself".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chad Meister (2010), The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, page 63; '''Quote''': "Even though Buddhism explicitly rejected the Hindu ideas of Atman (“soul”) and Brahman, Hinduism treats Sakyamuni Buddha as one of the ten avatars of Vishnu."&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hindu philosophy]], especially in the [[Vedanta]] school of [[Hinduism]], Ātman is the [[first principle]],&lt;ref&gt;Deussen, Paul and Geden, A.

P. 86. {{ISBN|1616402407}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''true'' self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena, the essence of an individual. In order to attain [[Moksha|liberation (moksha)]], a human being must acquire self-knowledge (atma [[jnana]]), which is to realize that one's true self (Ātman) is identical with the transcendent self [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=davidlorenzenatman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard King (1995), Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791425138}}, page 64, '''Quote:''' "Atman as the innermost essence or soul of man, and Brahman as the innermost essence and support of the universe. (...) Thus we can see in the Upanishads, a tendency towards a convergence of microcosm and macrocosm, culminating in the equating of atman with Brahman".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hindu philosophy|six orthodox schools of Hinduism]] believe that there is Ātman (soul, self) in every being.  This is a major point of difference with the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] doctrine of [[Anatta]] which holds that there is no unchanging soul or self.&lt;ref name=johnplott3/&gt;&lt;ref name=4sources&gt;KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, {{ISBN|978-8120806191}}, pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards; Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791422175}}, page 64; "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence."; Edward Roer (Translator), {{Google books|3uwDAAAAMAAJ|Shankara's Introduction|page=2}} to ''Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad'', pages 2-4; Katie Javanaud (2013), [https://philosophynow.org/issues/97/Is_The_Buddhist_No-Self_Doctrine_Compatible_With_Pursuing_Nirvana Is The Buddhist ‘No-Self’ Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?], Philosophy Now&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne (2011), ''The ātman and its negation'', Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 33, Number 1–2, pp. 103–105, '''Quote''': "The denial that a human being possesses a "self" or "soul" is probably the most famous Buddhist teaching. It is certainly its most distinct, as has been pointed out by G. P. Malalasekera: "In its denial of any real permanent Soul or Self, Buddhism stands alone." A similar modern Sinhalese perspective has been expressed by Walpola Rahula: "Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denying the existence of such a Soul, Self or Ātman." The "no Self" or "no soul" doctrine (Sanskrit: anātman; Pāli: anattan) is particularly notable for its widespread acceptance and historical endurance. It was a standard belief of virtually all the ancient schools of Indian Buddhism (the notable exception being the Pudgalavādins), and has persisted without change into the modern era. [...] both views are mirrored by the modern Theravādin perspective of Mahasi Sayadaw that "there is no person or soul" and the modern Mahāyāna view of the fourteenth Dalai Lama that "[t]he Buddha taught that … our belief in an independent self is the root cause of all suffering"."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the concept==

===Vedas===
The earliest use of word "Ātman" in [[Indian literature|Indian texts]] is found in the [[Rig Veda]] (RV X.97.11).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.९७ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं १०.९७], Wikisource; Quote: "यदिमा वाजयन्नहमोषधीर्हस्त आदधे । '''आत्मा''' यक्ष्मस्य नश्यति पुरा जीवगृभो यथा ॥११॥&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yāska]], the ancient Indian grammarian, commenting on this Rigvedic verse, accepts the following meanings of Ātman: the pervading principle, the organism in which other elements are united and the ultimate sentient principle.&lt;ref&gt;Baumer, Bettina and Vatsyayan, Kapila.

Ātman is a central idea in all of the [[Upanishads]], and "know your Ātman" is their thematic focus.&lt;ref name=ptraju&gt;PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887061394}}, pages 35-36&lt;/ref&gt; These texts state that the core of every person's self is not the body, nor the mind, nor the ego, but "Ātman", which means "soul" or "self".&lt;ref&gt;"Soul" is synonymous with "self" in translations of ancient texts of Hindu philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; Atman is the spiritual essence in all creatures, their real innermost essential being.&lt;ref name=alicebailey&gt;Alice Bailey (1973), The Soul and Its Mechanism, {{ISBN|978-0853301158}}, pages 82-83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eknath Easwaran (2007), The Upanishads, Nilgiri Press, {{ISBN|978-1586380212}}, pages 38-39, 318-320&lt;/ref&gt; It is eternal, it is the essence, it is ageless. Atman is that which one is at the deepest level of one's existence.

====''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad''====
The ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' describes Atman as that in which everything exists, which is of the highest value, which permeates everything, which is the essence of all, bliss and beyond description.&lt;ref&gt;Raju, Poolla Tirupati. Structural Depths of Indian Thought. SUNY Series in Philosophy. P. 26. {{ISBN|0-88706-139-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In hymn 4.4.5, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes Atman as Brahman (universal absolute; supreme soul), and associates it with everything one is, everything one can be, one's free will, one's desire, what one does, what one doesn't do, the good in oneself, the bad in oneself.
{{quote|That ''Atman'' (self, soul) is indeed Brahman. It [Ātman] is also identified with the intellect, the Manas (mind), and the vital breath, with the eyes and ears, with earth, water, air, and ākāśa (sky), with fire and with what is other than fire, with desire and the absence of desire, with anger and the absence of anger, with righteousness and unrighteousness, with everything — it is identified, as is well known, with this (what is perceived) and with that (what is inferred).

As it [Ātman, self, soul] does and acts, so it becomes: by doing good it becomes good, and by doing evil it becomes evil. It becomes virtuous through good acts, and vicious through evil acts. Others, however, say, "The self is identified with desire alone.

This theme of Ātman, that is soul and self of oneself, every person, every being is the same as Brahman, is extensively repeated in Brihadāranyaka Upanishad. The Upanishad asserts that this knowledge of "I am Brahman", and that there is no difference between "I" and "you", or "I" and "him" is a source of liberation, and not even gods can prevail over such a liberated man. For example, in hymn 1.4.10,&lt;ref name=bu1410/&gt;

{{quote|
Brahman was this before; therefore it knew even the Ātma (soul, himself). I am Brahman, therefore it became all. And whoever among the gods had this enlightenment, also became That. It is the same with the sages, the same with men. Whoever knows the self as “I am Brahman,” becomes all this universe. Even the gods cannot prevail against him, for he becomes their Ātma. Now, if a man worships another god, thinking: “He is one and I am another,” he does not know. He is like an animal to the gods. As many animals serve a man, so does each man serve the gods. Even if one animal is taken away, it causes anguish; how much more so when many are taken away? Therefore it is not pleasing to the gods that men should know this.

====''Katha Upanishad''====
Along with the ''Brihadāranyaka'', all the earliest and middle Upanishads discuss Ātman as they build their theories to answer how man can achieve liberation, freedom and bliss. The ''[[Katha Upanishad]]'', for example, explains Atman as immanent and transcendent innermost essence of each human being and living creature, that this is one, even though the external forms of living creatures manifest in different forms, for example, in hymns 2.2.9 and others, its states

{{quote|As the one fire, after it has entered the world, though one, takes different forms according to whatever it burns,&lt;br /&gt;
so does the internal Ātman of all living beings, though one, takes a form according to whatever He enters and is outside all forms.

Katha Upanishad, in Book 1, hymns 3.3 to 3.4, describes the widely cited analogy of chariot for the relation of "Soul, Self" to body, mind and senses.&lt;ref name=kathaup2&gt;Sanskrit Original: आत्मानँ रथितं विद्धि शरीरँ रथमेव तु । बुद्धिं तु सारथिं विद्धि मनः प्रग्रहमेव च ॥ ३ ॥ इन्द्रियाणि हयानाहुर्विषयाँ स्तेषु गोचरान् । आत्मेन्द्रियमनोयुक्तं भोक्तेत्याहुर्मनीषिणः ॥ ४ ॥, [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/कठोपनिषद् Katha Upanishad] Wikisource;&lt;br /&gt;English Translation: Max Müller, [https://archive.org/stream/SacredBooksEastVariousOrientalScholarsWithIndex.50VolsMaxMuller/15.SacredBooksEast.VarOrSch.v15.Muller.Hindu.Mull.Upanishads.p2.KathMundTait..Mait.Oxf.1884.#page/n71/mode/2up Katha Upanishad] Third Valli, Verse 3 &amp; 4 and through 15, pages 12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Kaplan&lt;ref name=stevekaplan&gt;Stephen Kaplan (2011), The Routledge Companion to Religion and Science, (Editors: James W.

Know the intellect as the charioteer, and the mind as the reins. The senses, they say are the horses, and sense objects are the paths around them". The Katha Upanishad then declares that "when the Self [Ātman] understands this and is unified, integrated with body, senses and mind, is virtuous, mindful and pure, he reaches bliss, freedom and liberation".&lt;ref name=kathaup2/&gt;

====''Chandogya Upanishad''====
The ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' explains Ātman as that which appears to be separate between two living beings but isn't, that essence and innermost, true, radiant self of all individuals which connects and unifies all. In hymn 4.10.1 through 4.10.3, for example, it explains it with example of rivers, some of which flow to the east and some to the west, but ultimately all merge into the ocean and become one. In the same way, the individual souls are pure being, states the ''Chandogya Upanishad''; an individual soul is pure truth, and an individual soul is a manifestation of the ocean of one universal soul.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], Upanishads, Wordsworth, {{ISBN|978-1840221022}}, pages XXIII-XXIV&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Upanishads====
Ātman is a key topic of the Upanishads, but they express two distinct, somewhat divergent themes. Some teach that Brahman (highest reality; universal principle; being-consciousness-bliss) is identical with Ātman, while others teach that Ātman is part of Brahman but not identical to it.&lt;ref name=johnkoller/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], {{Google books|B0QzAQAAMAAJ|The Philosophy of the Upanishads}}, Dover Publications, pages 86-111, 182-212&lt;/ref&gt; This ancient debate flowered into various dual and non-dual theories in Hinduism. The [[Brahmasutra]] by Badarayana (~100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects, particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and in the state of self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different (advaita).&lt;ref name=johnkoller/&gt; This synthesis overcame the dualistic tradition of Samkhya-Yoga schools and realism-driven traditions of Nyaya-Vaiseshika schools, enabling it to become the foundation of Vedanta as Hinduism's enduring spiritual tradition.&lt;ref name=johnkoller&gt;John Koller (2012), Shankara, in Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion, (Editors: Chad Meister, Paul Copan), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415782944}}, pages 99-102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==
{{Hindu philosophy}}
All major orthodox schools of Hinduism –Nyaya, Vaisesika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mimamsa, and Vedanta– accept the foundational premise of the Vedas and Upanishads that "Ātman exists". [[Ātman (Jainism)|Jainism]] too accepts this premise, though it has its own idea of what that means. In contrast, both Buddhism and the [[Charvaka]]s deny that there is anything called "Ātman/soul/self".&lt;ref name=johnplott/&gt;

Knowing Ātman, also referred to as self-knowledge, is one of the defining themes of all major orthodox schools of Hinduism, but they diverge on how. In Hinduism, self-knowledge is the knowledge and understanding of Atman, what it is, and what it is not. Hinduism considers Atman as distinct from the ever-evolving individual personality characterized with ''Ahamkara'' (ego, non-spiritual psychological I-ness Me-ness), habits, prejudices, desires, impulses, delusions, fads, behaviors, pleasures, sufferings and fears. Human personality and ''Ahamkara'' shift, evolve or change with time, state the schools of Hinduism; while, Atman doesn't.&lt;ref name=johnplott/&gt; Atman, state these schools, is the unchanging, eternal, innermost radiant self that is unaffected by personality, unaffected by ego of oneself, unaffected by ego of others; Atman is that which is ever-free, never-bound, one that seeks, realizes and is the realized purpose, meaning, liberation in life.&lt;ref&gt;James Hart (2009), Who One Is: Book 2: Existenz and Transcendental Phenomenology, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1402091773}}, pages 2-3, 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard White (2012), The Heart of Wisdom: A Philosophy of Spiritual Life, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1442221161}}, pages 125-131&lt;/ref&gt; Puchalski states, "the ultimate goal of Hindu religious life is to transcend individually, to realize one's own true nature", the inner essence of oneself, which is divine and pure.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Puchalski (2006), A Time for Listening and Caring, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195146820}}, page 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vedanta school===
Philosophical schools such as [[Advaita]] (non-dualism) see the "spirit/soul/self" within each living entity as being fully identical with [[Brahman]]– the universal soul.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmaintro/&gt; The Advaita school believes that there is one soul that connects and exists in all living beings, regardless of their shapes or forms, and there is no distinction, no superior, no inferior, no separate devotee soul (Atman), no separate god soul (Brahman).&lt;ref name=arvindsharmaintro&gt;Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Vedānta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820272}}, pages 19-40, 53-58, 79-86&lt;/ref&gt; The oneness unifies all beings, there is divine in every being, and that all existence is a single reality, state the Advaita Vedanta Hindus. In contrast, devotional sub-schools of Vedanta such as [[Dvaita]] (dualism) differentiate between the individual Atma in living beings, and the supreme Atma ([[Paramatma]]) as being separate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhagavata Purana]] [http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en 3.28.41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217121958/http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en |date=2012-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/7/19-20/en1 Bhagavata Purana 7.7.19–20] ""Atma" also refers to the Supreme Lord or the living entities. Both of them are spiritual."&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita Vedanta philosophy considers Atman as self-existent awareness, limitless and non-dual.&lt;ref name=aramb&gt;A Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791468524}}, pages 47, 99-103&lt;/ref&gt; To Advaitins, the Atman is the Brahman, the Brahman is the Atman, each self is non-different from the infinite.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmaintro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2008), Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Vedānta, Volume 3, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803107}}, pages 510-512&lt;/ref&gt; Atman is the universal principle, one eternal undifferentiated self-luminous consciousness, the truth asserts Advaita Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;S Timalsina (2014), Consciousness in Indian Philosophy: The Advaita Doctrine of ‘Awareness Only’, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415762236}}, pages 3-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliot Deutsch (1980), Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824802714}}, pages 48-53&lt;/ref&gt; Human beings, in a state of unawareness of this universal self, see their "I-ness" as different than the being in others, then act out of impulse, fears, cravings, malice, division, confusion, anxiety, passions, and a sense of distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;A Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791468524}}, pages 114-122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adi Sankara, A Bouquet of Nondual Texts: Advaita Prakarana Manjari, Translators: Ramamoorthy &amp; Nome, {{ISBN|978-0970366726}}, pages 173-214&lt;/ref&gt; To Advaitins, Atman-knowledge is the state of full awareness, liberation, and freedom that overcomes dualities at all levels, realizing the divine within oneself, the divine in others, and in all living beings; the non-dual oneness, that God is in everything, and everything is God.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmaintro/&gt;&lt;ref name=aramb/&gt; This identification of individual living beings/souls, or jiva-atmas, with the 'one Atman' is the non-dualistic [[Advaita Vedanta]] position.

The [[monism|monist]], non-dual conception of existence in Advaita Vedanta is not accepted by the dualistic/theistic [[Dvaita Vedanta]]. Dvaita Vedanta calls the Atman of a supreme being as ''"[[Paramatman]]"'', and holds it to be different from individual Atman. Dvaita scholars assert that God is the ultimate, complete, perfect, but distinct soul, one that is separate from incomplete, imperfect ''jivas'' (individual souls).&lt;ref&gt;R Prasad (2009), A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept Publishing, {{ISBN|978-8180695957}}, pages 345-347&lt;/ref&gt; The Advaita sub-school believes that self-knowledge leads to liberation in this life, while the Dvaita sub-school believes that liberation is only possible in after-life as communion with God, and only through the grace of God (if not, then one's Atman is reborn).&lt;ref&gt;James Lewis and William Travis (1999), Religious Traditions of the World, {{ISBN|978-1579102302}}, pages 279-280&lt;/ref&gt; God created individual souls, state Dvaita Vedantins, but the individual soul never was and never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God.&lt;ref name=tompad&gt;Thomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|978-3110342550}}, pages 155-157&lt;/ref&gt; The Dvaita school, therefore, in contrast to monistic position of Advaita, advocates a version of monotheism wherein [[Brahman]] is made synonymous with [[Vishnu]] (or Narayana), distinct from numerous individual Atmans. Dvaita school, states Graham Oppy, is not strict monotheism, as it does not deny existence of other gods and their respective Atman.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Oppy (2014), Describing Gods, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1107087040}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vedanta sub-schools of [[Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] and [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]] combine ideas about Ātman from dual and non-dual schools.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Mimamsa school===
Ātman, in the ritualism-based [[Mīmāṃsā]] school of Hinduism, is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active essence that is identified as I-consciousness.&lt;ref name=ptraju2&gt;PT Raju (2008), The Philosophical Traditions of India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415461214}}, pages 79-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chrisbartley&gt;Chris Bartley (2013), Purva Mimamsa, in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, 978-0415862530, page 443-445&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike all other schools of Hinduism, Mimamsaka scholars considered ego and Atman as the same. Within Mimamsa school, there was divergence of beliefs. Kumārila, for example, believed that Atman is the object of I-consciousness, whereas Prabhakara believed that Atman is the subject of I-consciousness.&lt;ref name=ptraju2/&gt; Mimamsaka Hindus believed that what matters is virtuous actions and rituals completed with perfection, and it is this that creates merit and imprints knowledge on Atman, whether one is aware or not aware of Atman. Their foremost emphasis was formulation and understanding of laws/duties/virtuous life ([[dharma]]) and consequent perfect execution of ''kriyas'' (actions). The Upanishadic discussion of Atman, to them, was of secondary importance.&lt;ref name=chrisbartley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman (2006), Shruti, in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, page 503&lt;/ref&gt; While other schools disagreed and discarded the Atma theory of Mimamsa, they incorporated Mimamsa theories on ethics, self-discipline, action, and dharma as necessary in one's journey toward knowing one's Atman.&lt;ref&gt;PT Raju (2008), The Philosophical Traditions of India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415461214}}, pages 82-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887061394}}, pages 54-63; Michael C.

===Vaiśeṣika school===
The [[Vaisheshika]] school of Hinduism, using its non-theistic theories of atomistic [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], posits that Ātman is one of the four eternal non-physical&lt;ref&gt;The school posits that there are five physical substances: earth, water, air, water and ''akasa'' (ether/sky/space beyond air)&lt;/ref&gt; substances without attributes, the other three being ''kala'' (time), ''dik'' (space) and ''manas'' (mind).&lt;ref name=sarachmo&gt;Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore (Eds., 1973), A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1973, {{ISBN|978-0691019581}}, pages 386-423&lt;/ref&gt; Time and space, stated Vaiśeṣika scholars, are ''eka'' (one), ''nitya'' (eternal) and ''vibhu'' (all pervading). Time and space are indivisible reality, but human mind prefers to divide them to comprehend past, present, future, relative place of other substances and beings, direction and its own coordinates in the universe. In contrast to these characteristics of time and space, Vaiśeṣika scholars considered Ātman to be many, eternal, independent and spiritual substances that cannot be reduced or inferred from other three non-physical and five physical ''dravya'' (substances).&lt;ref name=sarachmo/&gt; Mind and sensory organs are instruments, while consciousness is the domain of "atman, soul, self".&lt;ref name=sarachmo/&gt;

The knowledge of Ātman, to Vaiśeṣika Hindus, is another knowledge without any "bliss" or "consciousness" moksha state that Vedanta and Yoga school describe.&lt;ref name=johnplott/&gt;

===Nyaya school===
Early atheistic [[Nyaya]] scholars, and later theistic Nyaya scholars, both made substantial contributions to the systematic study of Ātman.&lt;ref name=johnplott2/&gt; They posited that even though "self/soul" is intimately related to the knower, it can still be the subject of knowledge. John Plott&lt;ref name=johnplott2&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, page 62&lt;/ref&gt; states that the Nyaya scholars developed a theory of negation that far exceeds [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s theory of [[negation]], while their epistemological theories refined to "know the knower" at least equals Aristotle's sophistication. Nyaya methodology influenced all major schools of Hinduism.

The Nyaya scholars defined Ātman as an imperceptible substance that is the substrate of human consciousness, manifesting itself with or without qualities such as desires, feelings, perception, knowledge, understanding, errors, insights, sufferings, bliss, and others.&lt;ref name=elisa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KK Chakrabarti (1999), Classical Indian Philosophy of Mind: The Nyaya Dualist Tradition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791441718}}, pages 2, 187-188, 220&lt;/ref&gt; Nyaya school not only developed its theory of Atman, it contributed to Hindu philosophy in a number of ways. To the Hindu theory of Ātman, the contributions of Nyaya scholars were twofold. One, they went beyond holding it as "self evident" and offered rational proofs, consistent with their epistemology, in their debates with Buddhists, that "Atman exists".&lt;ref name=nyayaexamples/&gt; Second, they developed theories on what "Atman is and is not".&lt;ref name=royperrett&gt;Roy W. Perrett (Editor, 2000), Indian Philosophy: Metaphysics, Volume 3, Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|978-0815336082}}, page xvii; also see Chakrabarti pages 279-292&lt;/ref&gt; As proofs for the proposition "self/soul exists", for example, Nyaya scholars argued that personal recollections and memories of the form "I did this so many years ago" implicitly presume that there is a self that is substantial, continuing, unchanged, and existent.&lt;ref name=nyayaexamples&gt;See example discussed in this section; For additional examples of Nyaya reasoning to prove that "soul exists", using propositions and its theories of negation, see: [https://archive.org/stream/TheNyayaSutrasOfGotama/Vidyabhusana_Nyaya-Sutras_1913#page/n39/mode/2up Nyayasutra] verses 1.2.1 on pages 14-15, 1.2.59 on page 20, 3.1.1-3.1.27 on pages 63-69, and later chapters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=royperrett/&gt;

[[Nyāya Sūtras|Nyayasutra]], a 2nd-century CE foundational text of Nyaya school of Hinduism, states that the soul is a proper object of human knowledge. It also states that soul is a real substance that can be inferred from certain signs, objectively perceivable attributes. For example, in book 1, chapter 1, verses 9 and 10, Nyayasutra states&lt;ref name=elisa/&gt;

{{Quote|
''Ātman'', body, senses, objects of senses, intellect, mind, activity, error, ''pretyabhava'' (after life), fruit, suffering and bliss are the objects of right knowledge.&lt;br&gt;
Desire, aversion, effort, happiness, suffering and cognition are the ''Linga'' (लिङ्ग, mark, sign) of the ''Ātman''.

In book 2, chapter 1, verses 1 to 23, Nyayasutras text posits that the sensory act of looking is different than perception and cognition, that perception and knowledge arise from the seekings and actions of Ātman (soul).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/TheNyayaSutrasOfGotama/Vidyabhusana_Nyaya-Sutras_1913#page/n47/mode/2up Nyayasutra] see pages 22-29&lt;/ref&gt; Naiyayikas emphasize that Ātman has qualities, but is different than its qualities. For example, desire is one of many quality of Ātman in Nyaya school, but they state that Ātman need not always have desire, and in the state of liberation, for instance, Atman is without desire.&lt;ref name=elisa/&gt; Atman is the object, and the conventional "I, me" is one of its subjects, to Nyaya school.&lt;ref name=elisa/&gt;

===Samkhya school===
The concept of Ātman in [[Samkhya]], the oldest school of Hinduism, is quite similar to one in Advaita Vedanta school. Both Samkhya and Advaita consider the ego (asmita, [[ahamkara]]) rather than the Ātman to be the cause of pleasure and pain.&lt;ref&gt;Paranjpe, A. C. Self and Identity in Modern Psychology and Indian Thought. Springer; 1 edition (September 30, 1998). P. 263-264. {{ISBN|978-0-306-45844-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They both consider Ātman as self, soul that is innermost essence of any individual being. Further, they both consider self-knowledge as the means of liberation, freedom and bliss. The difference between Samkhya and Advaita is that Samkhya holds there are as many ''Atmans'' as there are beings, each distinct reality unto itself, and self-knowledge a state of Ipseity. In contrast, the monism theme of Advaita holds that there is one soul, and that the self of all beings are connected and unified with Brahman.&lt;ref name=johnplott/&gt; The essence and spirit of everything is related to each self, asserts Advaita Vedanta, and each Atman is related to the essence and spirit of everything; all is one; self is Brahman and Brahman is self. Samkhya asserts that each being's Atman is unique and different.&lt;ref name=johnplott&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, pages 60-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga school===
The Yogasutra of Patanjali, the foundational text of [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] school of Hinduism, mentions ''Atma'' in multiple verses, and particularly in its last book, where Samadhi is described as the path to self-knowledge and [[moksha|kaivalya]]. Some earlier mentions of Atman in Yogasutra include verse 2.5, where evidence of ignorance includes "confusing what is not Atman as Atman".

Avidya (अविद्या, ignorance) is regarding the transient as eternal, the impure as pure, the pain-giving as joy-giving, and the non-Atman as Atman.
|Yogasutra 2.5&lt;ref name=pyogas3t&gt;

In verses 2.19-2.20, Yogasutra declares that pure ideas are the domain of the soul, the perceivable universe exists to enlighten the soul, but while the soul is pure, it may be deceived by complexities of perception or its intellect. These verses also set the purpose of all experience as a means to self-knowledge.

{{quote|
द्रष्टा दृशिमात्रः शुद्धोऽपि प्रत्ययानुपश्यः&lt;br&gt;
तदर्थ एव दृश्यस्यात्मा

The seer (soul) is the absolute knower. Though pure, modifications are witnessed by him by coloring of intellect.&lt;br&gt;
The spectacle exists only to serve the purpose of the Atman.
|Yogasutra 2.19 - 2.20&lt;ref name=pyogas3t/&gt;}}

In Book 4, Yogasutra states spiritual liberation as the stage where the yogin achieves distinguishing self-knowledge, he no longer confuses his mind as his soul, the mind is no longer affected by afflictions or worries of any kind, ignorance vanishes, and "pure consciousness settles in its own pure nature".&lt;ref name=pyogas3t/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verses 4.24-4.34, Patanjali's Yogasutras; Quote: "विशेषदर्शिन '''आत्म'''भावभावनाविनिवृत्तिः"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yoga school is similar to the Samkhya school in its conceptual foundations of Ātman. It is the self that is discovered and realized in the Kaivalya state, in both schools. Like Samkhya, this is not a single universal Ātman. It is one of the many individual selves where each "pure consciousness settles in its own pure nature", as a unique distinct soul/self.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H. Phillips, ''Classical Indian Metaphysics: Refutations of Realism and the Emergence of "new Logic".'' Open Court Publishing, 1995, pages 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Yoga school's methodology was widely influential on other schools of Hindu philosophy. Vedanta monism, for example, adopted Yoga as a means to reach ''Jivanmukti'' – self-realization in this life – as conceptualized in Advaita Vedanta.

==Influence of Atman theory on Hindu Ethics==
[[File:Non violence sculpture by carl fredrik reutersward malmo sweden.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Ahimsa]], non-violence, is considered the highest ethical value and virtue in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=evpc&gt;Stephen H. Phillips &amp; other authors (2008), in Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, &amp; Conflict (Second Edition), {{ISBN|978-0123739858}}, Elsevier Science, Pages 1347–1356, 701-849, 1867&lt;/ref&gt; The virtue of Ahimsa follows from the Atman theories of Hindu traditions.&lt;ref name=ludwig/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NF Gier (1995), Ahimsa, the Self, and Postmodernism, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 35, Issue 1, pages 71-86, {{doi|10.5840/ipq199535160}};&lt;br&gt;Jean Varenne (1977), Yoga and the Hindu Tradition, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226851167}}, page 200-202&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Atman theory in Upanishads had a profound impact on ancient ethical theories and dharma traditions now known as Hinduism.&lt;ref name=ludwig&gt;Ludwig Alsdorf (2010), The History of Vegetarianism and Cow-Veneration in India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415548243}}, pages 111-114&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[Dharmaśāstra#The meaning and sources of Dharma|Dharmasutras]] of Hindus recite Atman theory from the Vedic texts and Upanishads,&lt;ref&gt;These ancient texts of India refer to Upanishads and Vedic era texts some of which have been traced to preserved documents, but some are lost or yet to be found.&lt;/ref&gt; and on its foundation build precepts of dharma, laws and ethics. Atman theory, particularly the Advaita Vedanta and Yoga versions, influenced the emergence of the theory of [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence against all creatures), culture of vegetarianism, and other theories of ethical, dharmic life.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H. Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231144858}}, pages 122-125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knut Jacobsen (1994), The institutionalization of the ethics of “non-injury” toward all “beings” in Ancient India, Environmental Ethics, Volume 16, Issue 3, pages 287-301, {{doi|10.5840/enviroethics199416318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma-sutras===
The Dharmasutras and Dharmasastras integrate the teachings of Atman theory. Apastamba Dharmasutra, the oldest known Indian text on dharma, for example, titles Chapters 1.8.22 and 1.8.23 as "Knowledge of the Atman" and then recites,&lt;ref name=apastamba1&gt;Sanskrit Original: [http://www.hinduonline.co/vedicreserve/kalpa/dharma/apastamba_dharma_sutra.pdf Apastamba Dharma Sutra] page 14;&lt;br&gt;'''English Translation 1''': [https://archive.org/stream/sacredlawsofarya00buhliala#page/n139/mode/2up Knowledge of the Atman] Apastamba Dharmasutra, The Sacred Laws of the Aryas, [[Georg Bühler]] (Translator), pages 75-79;&lt;br&gt;'''English Translation 2''': Ludwig Alsdorf (2010), The History of Vegetarianism and Cow-Veneration in India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415548243}}, pages 111-112;&lt;br&gt;'''English Translation 3''': [[Patrick Olivelle]] (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0192838827}}, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahimsa===
The ethical prohibition against harming any human beings or other living creatures (Ahimsa, अहिंसा), in Hindu traditions, can be traced to the Atman theory.&lt;ref name=ludwig/&gt; This precept against injuring any living being appears together with Atman theory in hymn 8.15.1 of Chandogya Upanishad (ca. 8th century BCE),&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit original: तधैतद्ब्रह्मा प्रजापतये उवाच प्रजापतिर्मनवे मनुः प्रजाभ्यः आचार्यकुलाद्वेदमधीत्य यथाविधानं गुरोः कर्मातिशेषेणाभिसमावृत्य कुटुम्बे शुचौ देशे स्वाध्यायमधीयानो धर्मिकान्विदधदात्मनि सर्वैन्द्रियाणि संप्रतिष्ठा'''प्याहिँस'''न्सर्व भूतान्यन्यत्र तीर्थेभ्यः स खल्वेवं वर्तयन्यावदायुषं ब्रह्मलोकमभिसंपद्यते न च पुनरावर्तते न च पुनरावर्तते ॥१॥; [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/छान्दोग्योपनिषद्_४ छान्दोग्योपनिषद् ४] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English Translation: Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 205&lt;/ref&gt; then becomes central in the texts of Hindu philosophy, entering the dharma codes of ancient ''Dharmasutras'' and later era ''Manu-Smriti''. Ahimsa theory is a natural corollary and consequence of "Atman is universal oneness, present in all living beings. Atman connects and prevades in everyone. Hurting or injuring another being is hurting the Atman, and thus one's self that exists in another body". This conceptual connection between one's Atman, the universal, and Ahimsa starts in [[Isha Upanishad]],&lt;ref name=ludwig/&gt; develops in the theories of the ancient scholar Yajnavalkya, and one which inspired [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] as he led non-violent movement against colonialism in early 20th century.&lt;ref name=maxmullerisha/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deen K.

==Atman – the difference between Hinduism and Buddhism==
{{See also|Anatta|Buddha-nature| Shentong |Sunyata|Precanonical Buddhism}}

All orthodox schools of Hinduism hold the premise, "Atman exists, as self evident truth". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, "Atman does not exist (or, An-atman) as self evident".&lt;ref&gt;Dae-Sook Suh (1994), Korean Studies: New Pacific Currents, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824815981}}, page 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnplott3&gt;John C.

As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism".&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhists do not believe that at the core of all human beings and living creatures, there is any "eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman".&lt;ref name=4sources/&gt; Buddhists reject the concept and all doctrines associated with atman, call atman as illusion (''maya''), asserting instead the theory of "no-self" and "no-soul".&lt;ref name=johnplott3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen J Baroni (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0823922406}}, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism, from its earliest days, has denied the existence of the "self, soul" in its core philosophical and ontological texts. In its soteriological themes, Buddhism has defined [[nirvana]] as that blissful state when a person realizes that he or she has "no self, no soul".&lt;ref name=4sources/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 23, Issue 1, pages 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins |title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC |year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-39726-1 |page=82}}; '''Quote:''' "It is at this point that the differences [between Upanishads and Abhidharma] start to become marked. There is no central self which animates the impersonal elements. The concept of nirvana (Pali ''nibbana''), although similarly the criterion according to which ethical judgements are made and religious life assessed, is not the liberated state of a self. Like all other things and concepts (''dhamma'') it is ''anatta'', not-self [in Buddhism].";&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman C.

Literally meaning no (an-) self or soul (-atman), this Buddhist term applies to the denial of a metaphysically changeless, eternal and autonomous soul or self. (...) The early canonical Buddhist view of nirvana sometimes suggests a kind of extinction-like (kataleptic) state that automatically encourages a metaphysical no-soul (self)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus believe in Atman. They hold that at the core of all human beings and living creatures, there is "eternal, innermost essential and absolute something called a soul, self that is atman."&lt;ref name=4sources/&gt; Within the diverse [[Hindu philosophy|schools of Hinduism]], there are differences of opinion on whether souls are distinct, whether a supreme soul or god exists, whether the nature of Atman is dual or non-dual, how to reach [[moksha]]– the knowledge of self that liberates one to blissful content state of existence, and whether moksha is achievable in this life (Advaita Vedanta, Yoga) or is achievable only in after-life (Dvaita Vedanta, Nyaya). However, despite these diversity of ideas and paths in different schools of Hinduism, unlike Buddhism, the foundation premise of Hinduism is that "soul/self exists", and there is bliss in seeking self, knowing self, and self-realization.&lt;ref name=4sources/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sengaku Mayeda (2000), Sankara and Buddhism, in New Perspectives on Advaita Vedānta (Editors: Richard V.

{{Quote|
While the ''[[Upanishad]]s'' recognized many things as being not-Self, they felt that a real, true Self could be found. They held that when it was found, and known to be identical to Brahman, the basis of everything, this would bring liberation. In the Buddhist ''[[Buddhist texts|Suttas]]'', though, literally everything is seen is non-Self, even [[Nirvana]]. When this is known, then liberation – ''Nirvana'' – is attained by total non-attachment. Thus both the ''Upanishads'' and the Buddhist ''Suttas'' see many things as not-Self, but the Suttas apply it, indeed non-Self, to ''everything''.

In Theravada tradition, the [[Dhammakaya Movement]] in Thailand teaches that it is erroneous to subsume nirvana under the rubric of ''anatta'' (non-self); instead, nirvana is taught to be the "true self" or ''[[Dharmakaya|dhammakaya]]''.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=100–5, 110}} Similar interpretations have been put forth by the then [[Sangharaja of Thailand|Thai Sangharaja]] in 1939. According to Williams, the Sangharaja's interpretation echoes the ''[[tathagatagarbha|tathāgatagarbha]]'' sutras.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=126}} The Dhammakaya Movement teaching that nirvana is [[Atman (Buddhism)|atta (atman)]] in 1999, has been criticized as heretical in Buddhism by [[Prayudh Payutto|Ven.

According to Johannes Bronkhorst, a professor of Indology specializing in early Buddhism and Hinduism, while there may be ambivalence on the existence or non-existence of self in early Buddhist literature, it is clear from these texts that seeking self-knowledge is not the Buddhist path for liberation, and turning away from self-knowledge is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AZbZDP8MRJoC|year=1993|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1114-0 |pages=99 with footnote 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= Buddhist Teaching in India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn= 978-0-86171-811-5|pages= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
There is not what could be called a philosophical system in these Upanishads. They are, in the true sense of the word, guesses at truth, frequently contradicting each other, yet all tending in one direction. The key-note of the old Upanishads is "know thyself," but with a much deeper meaning than that of the ''γνῶθι σεαυτόν'' of the [[Know thyself|Delphic Oracle]]. The "know thyself" of the Upanishads means, know thy true self, that which underlines thine Ego, and find it and know it in the highest, the eternal Self, the One without a second, which underlies the whole world.
