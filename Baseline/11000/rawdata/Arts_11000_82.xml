'''Louise Marie ''Adélaïde'' Eugénie d'Orléans''' ([[Paris]], 23 August 1777 – Paris, 31 December 1847) was a French princess, one of the [[twin]] daughters of [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d'Orléans]], known as ''Philippe Égalité'' during the [[French Revolution]], and [[Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon]]. She was titled ''Mademoiselle de Chartres'' at birth, ''Mademoiselle d'Orléans'' at the death of her twin sister in 1782, ''Mademoiselle'' (1783–1812), ''Madame Adélaïde'' (1830). As a member of the reigning [[House of Bourbon]], she was a ''[[Prince du Sang|princesse du sang]]''.

== Biography ==
Adélaïde was raised according to the liberal principles of her governess, [[Stéphanie Félicité du Crest de Saint-Aubin|Madame de Genlis]], principles which also became her own political conviction. She received an excellent but also very hard and strenuous education; to harden herself, she learned to sleep on a hard bed and arise at six every day. She was deeply attached to her governess, and her mother's demand that de Genlis be replaced, though without success, was reportedly a cause of great worry for her. She was considered for marriage to the [[Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême|Duke of Angoulême]], but the plans were prevented by queen [[Marie Antoinette]]. Later on, she was also considered for marriage to the [[Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry|Duke of Berry]], which did not materialise either.

During the [[French Revolution]], de Genlis on at least one occasion took her to the radical [[Cordelieres Club]]. In 1791, her father asked de Genlis to take her to [[England]] for her safety. The year after, he summoned them back to prevent Adelaide's name from being placed on the list of emigrees. When they arrived, however, de Genlis discovered that Adélaïde was already on the list and that her father, whose political situation had deteriorated, asked her to take Adélaïde out of the country again.

Adelaide received painting lessons from [[Pierre-Joseph Redouté]] and produced some highly-regarded botanical studies as a result. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmitchell.net/Princesse-Louise-Marie-Eugenie-Adelaide-dOrleans-1777-1847-Pansies-Morning-Glories-and-Single-Chrysanthemums-DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=6&amp;tabindex=5&amp;objectid=668553&amp;categoryid=10236|title=Pansies, Morning Glories and Single Chrysanthemums|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life in exile===
In 1792, she left France with de Genlis to the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and then to [[Switzerland]], where she was placed in a convent in Bremgarten. During the Terror her father was guillotined, and her mother was banished to [[Spain]]. Sometime in the spring of 1794, Adélaïde moved to the home of her aunt, the [[Maria Fortunata d'Este|Princess of Conti]]. They moved to Bavaria in 1798 and thereafter to [[Bratislava]], and in 1801, she joined her mother in [[Barcelona]] in Spain. Her relationship with her mother was not good, as she disapproved of her mother's relationship with chancellor de Folmont.

On 25 November 1809, she and her mother attended the wedding of her brother [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] to [[Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily]] in [[Palermo, Sicily|Palermo]] on [[Sicily]]. After the wedding, she did not return with her mother to Spain, but preferred to live with her brother and sister-in-law at Palazzo Orléans in Palermo. She was described as completely devoted to her brother and his family: united with her sister-in-law in their mutual love and concern for him, and a second mother to his children.

===Return to France===
After the fall of Napoleon in 1814, she returned with her brother and his family to Paris and settled with them in [[Palais-Royal]]. During the [[Bourbon Restoration]], Palais-Royal was described as a center of high society social life in the capital, and reportedly, despite the fact that custom dictated that she as an unmarried "spinster" was expected to live in the background, it was she rather than her more reserved sister-in-law who took the role of hostess. 

She was described as firm, intellectual, and frank, and she was a leading force in the family councils of the [[House of Orléans]]. Her loyalty to her brother has been described as due to the fact that, early separated from her family, she was treated with reserve during her exile because of the political actions of her father during the revolution, and her brother was the first person she could lavish her affection upon. Louis Philippe, in turn, relied upon her intelligence and loyalty, made her his confidant and listened to her advice, and consequently, she came to exert great political influence upon him. Being brought up a liberal, she supported the idea of a constitutional monarchy and a representative government. 

She was not on good terms with the reigning Bourbon family; because of their reactionary ideas, and also because the hostility shown by the toward the Orléans line, and to her particularly by [[Marie Thérèse of France]]. Adélaïde rather than her brother are described as the active head of the Orléans fraction, and she had the active desire and ambition to make him monarch. In her apartment at Palais-Royal, she hosted a salon which became the center of liberal opposition toward the regime, and by use of her great personal fortune, she supported the liberal press and various political actors, artists, intellectuals and influential figures to gather support for her brother, among them Talleyrand.

===July Monarchy===
When Louis-Philippe became King of the French in the reign known as the [[July Monarchy]] (1830–1848), she was known as ''Madame Adélaïde''. All her life, she was his loyal advisor or, in 19th century parlance, his "[[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]]". It was she who, reportedly, encouraged him to accept the crown during the [[July revolution]], and her influence continued undisturbed during his reign. When tumult followed the publication of the Ordinances in 1830 and erupted in the July revolution in Paris, the Orléans family was at the country estate Neuilly.  

Adélaïde convinced Louis-Philippe that the moment was right for him to place himself as the leader of the opposition against the [[Absolute monarchy in France|absolute monarchy]] of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], and present himself as the candidate of a [[constitutional monarchy]], in between the unpopular absolute monarchy and the republicanism.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Dyson, C. C: The life of Marie Amélie last queen of the French, 1782–1866. With some account of the principal personages at the courts of Naples and France in her time, and of the careers of her sons and daughters (1910).&lt;/ref&gt; In this, she defeated the view of her sister-in-law Maria Amalia, who was loyal to the reigning older branch. When rumors arrived that the royalists were going to arrest Louis-Philippe, he evacuated to [[Raincy]] and the children were sent to Villiers-Coterets, but Adélaïde and Maria Amalia remained at Neuilly. When a delegation reached Neuilly and offered Louis-Philippe the crown, Maria Amalia refused the offer on behalf of herself and her spouse as an insult, reproaching Scheffer and [[Adolphe Thiers|Thiers]] for insulting them by having made it.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Adélaïde, however, accepted it with the argument that her brother would do anything to prevent the country he loved from anarchy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Thiers accepted the answer of Adélaïde rather than the one from Maria Amalia with the words: "Madame, you have given the crown to your family".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  After this, several other visits followed from people asking Louis-Philippe to accept the crown: to all, Maria Amalia answered that Louis-Philippe was an honest man and thus could not do it, while Adélaïde contradicted her by stating, that the offer should be made to Louis-Philippe by the chamber of deputies; and if he should hesitate, she would herself go to Paris and accept the crown for him.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Soon after, the Chamber of Deputies called Louis-Philippe to Paris to formally present him their offer. It has been estimated that he accepted the crown largely because of Adélaïde.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

At 6 August 1830, she and her sister-in-law were present at the tribune on the ceremony at the chambers in Paris when Louis Philippe was declared King of the French. She and her sister-in-law visited those who had been wounded during the revolution, and supported them financially.   
In October 1830, a mob broke into the Palais-Royal, and repeated attempts were made to execute the ministers of the former regime, which was refused by Louis-Philippe. When marshal [[Étienne Maurice Gérard|Gerard]] remarked that it would be difficult to save them, she replied: "Well Monsieur, then we will all perish in the attempt".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; During his reign, Louis-Philippe visited her daily, discussed the matters of state and family with her, and followed her advice.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Her death was therefore regarded as a great loss not only on an emotional but also a political scale.

Adélaïde d'Orléans died on 31 December 1847, two months before Louis Philippe's abdication on 24 February 1848. She is buried in the Orléans family necropolis in the [[Chapelle royale de Dreux|Royal Chapel of Dreux]].

Stone Center Recognition of Merit, a Georgia Children's Book Award, and is a [[Reading Rainbow]] book. Viorst followed this book up with two sequels, ''Alexander, Who Used to be Rich Last Sunday'' {{ISBN|978-0-689-30602-0}}, and ''Alexander, Who's Not (Do You Hear Me? I Mean It!) Going to Move'' {{ISBN|0-689-31958-4}}.

==Plot==
From the moment Alexander wakes up, things just go wrong in his way. As he gets up, the chewing gum that was in his mouth last night somehow ends up in his hair. He trips on the skateboard and drops his sweater in the sink while the water is running. He finds out that it is going to be a terrible, horrible, no good very bad day. 

At the table, his brothers Nick and Anthony find prizes in their breakfast cereal boxes at breakfast time. Nick finds a decoder ring and Anthony finds a toy car. But as for Alexander, he only has breakfast cereal. 

In the carpool on the way to school, he does not get a window seat. At school, his teacher, Mrs. Dickens, says she likes Paul’s picture of a sailboat  rather than Alexander's picture of the invisible castle (which is actually just a blank sheet of paper). At singing time, she says that Alexander sang too loud. At counting time, she says that Alexander skipped the number [[16 (number)|16]]. Then Alexander (after he forgot "16") says that no one needs the number 16 ("Who needs sixteen?"). Then at recess, Alexander's best friend, Paul says that Alexander is no longer his best friend. He says that Phillip is his first best friend and Albert is his second best friend. But Alexander is only his third. Then Alexander says that he hopes Paul sits on a tack. He also says that he hopes the next time Paul gets a double decker strawberry ice cream cone, the ice cream falls off the cone part and it lands somewhere in Australia. At [[lunch]], Phillip has two [[cupcakes]] for dessert and Albert has a [[Hershey bar]] with [[almonds]]. And for Paul, his mother let him have a [[swiss roll|jelly roll]] with [[coconut]] [[sprinkles]]. But since Alexander's mother forgot to put in dessert, there is no dessert in his lunch bag.

After school, Alexander's mother takes both Alexander and his brothers Nick and Anthony to the dentist. The dentist Dr. Fields finds a cavity only in Alexander. He tells him he has a cavity and says he will see him next week and fix it. On the way down, the elevator door closes on Alexander's foot. Anthony pushes him into a mud puddle, and when Alexander cries because of the mud Nick says he is a crybaby. Then he punches Nick in response for calling him a “cry baby”. And at last, their mother comes back with the car. She then scolds Alexander for being muddy and fighting Nick.      
        
At the shoe store, Alexander wanted blue sneakers with red stripes, but they are out of Alexander's choice, so his mother has to buy him plain white ones, which he refuses to wear. At his father's office, he makes a mess of things when he fools around with everything there (the copying machine, the books, and the telephone). He tells Alexander to not play with his phone. But Alexander calls Australia. Then, the father gets to the point where he tells the family to stop picking him up from work by saying "Please don't pick me up anymore" to Alexander.

At home, they have lima beans for dinner (which he hates), Alexander watches kissing on TV (which he also hates), his bath-time is worst (the water being too hot, getting soap in his eyes, and his marble going down the drain), but the worst of all, he is forced to wear his railroad train pajamas (which he also hates). At bedtime, his [[Mickey Mouse]] [[nightlight]] burns out, he bites his tongue, Nick takes back a [[Pillow#Types|bed pillow]] he said Alexander could keep, and the cat says he wants to sleep with Anthony (but not Alexander).

In the end, Alexander says it has been a terrible, horrible, no good very bad day for him. His mother says to him that some days are like that, even in Australia. 

A [[running gag]] throughout the book is Alexander repeating several times that he wants to move to [[Australia]] because he thinks it is better there.&lt;ref name="kc"/&gt; It ends with his mother's assurance that everybody has bad days, even those who live there.&lt;ref name="kc"/&gt; In the Australian and New Zealand versions, he wants to move to [[Timbuktu]] instead. Alexander says tomorrow things must not get any worse.

==TV adaptation==

On Saturday, January 13, 1990, the book was adapted into a 30-minute animated musical [[television special]] that was produced by [[Klasky Csupo]] and aired on [[HBO]] in the United States. 

While the special is mostly true to the book, the following differences are:
* Aside from the running gag of Alexander making references to Australia, the producers added another running gag in the special: he searches everywhere for his favorite yo-yo, a purple glow-in-the-dark one.
* Alexander has red hair instead of orange.
* Dad has no mustache and has brown hair instead of blonde.
* Mom does not have a bandana.
* Nick has blonde hair instead of brown and wears glasses.
* Anthony has brown hair instead of blonde.
* The cat, unnamed in the book, is named Timothy.
* Phillip Parker is white instead of black and does not wear glasses.
* Albert Moyo is black instead of white.
* The [[Mickey Mouse]] night light is replaced with a lamp light, due to copyright from [[Disney]].
This special features 12 more bad things for Alexander:
* He opens a drawer too far, making it land on his right foot.
* He spills cereal on the floor while searching for a free prize.
* The kids laugh when Alexander says that he is being scrunched and smushed in the car
* He falls off of the seat when the carpool stops by his school.
* His friends will not let him play [[Monkey in the Middle]].
* He sings "roll" and "Mary Lee" while his class sings "[[Row, Row, Row Your Boat]]".
* His friends tease him multiple times when he draws a picture of an invisible castle, sings his song loudly and incorrectly, skips the number 16, gets no dessert, and explains why he refuses to play ball with them after school.
* His friends close the doors on him after school.
* He was forced by the dentist, Dr. Fields, to sit still for 30 seconds for messing around with the toothpaste, dental chair, and tray.
* His brothers pretend to be in pain when Alexander hops due to the elevator door closing on his foot.
* The shoe salesman turns down his alternate choice of sneakers (green ones).
* He is forced by his father to sit out on the couch for a [[Time-out (parenting)|time-out]] for playing with the copying machine and knocking the books off his father's desk.
The special also includes 4 good things to show the audience that even a bad day can have something good in it:
* Alexander's friends ask him if he wants to play ball with them before Alexander refuses.
* Anthony and Nick make up for what they did to Alexander while waiting for their mom to pick up the car.
* Mom finds Alexander's favorite yo-yo in the closet while turning off the bedroom light.
* Before the end credits, Timothy (the cat) changes his mind and sleeps with Alexander while talking about how Mom says everybody has bad days, even in Australia.
Although mentioned, the three following bad things are not shown in the special:
* The family has lima beans for dinner.
* Alexander watching kissing on TV.
* Alexander's bath making the evening worse.
The special also included three original songs:
* "So much to do, so little time in the morning"
* "If I could be the only child"
* "I've had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day"

In 2004, a stage adaptation was run at the [http://bstreettheatre.org/ B Street Theatre].

A [[Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (film)|Disney live-action film adaptation]] was released in 2014.

==Characters==
Alexander and his two older brothers, Anthony and Nick, are based on Viorst's own three sons of the same names. But the film changed Nick to Emily, replacing the brother with a sister, and adds Trevor as well.&lt;ref name="mjs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=688766|title=Grandmother learns lesson in flexibility|accessdate=December 22, 2007|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|year=2007|author=Mary-Liz Shaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531161248/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=688766|archivedate=May 31, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
The phrase "terrible, horrible, no good, very bad . . ." has become an [[Internet meme]], often used by bloggers, and sometimes by mainstream media, to criticize, or characterize setbacks for, an individual or political movement.
The phrase is also used in the Stephen King miniseries Kingdom Hospital by the orderlies Abel and Christa.

'''Alexandria''' is an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] in the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] of [[Virginia]] in the United States. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 139,966,&lt;ref name="QF"&gt;{{cite web|title=State &amp; County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51510.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016, the population was estimated to be 155,810.&lt;ref name="USCensusEst2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045216/51510,00|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2016|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located along the western bank of the [[Potomac River]], Alexandria is approximately {{convert|7|mi|0}} south of [[Downtown, Washington, D.C.|downtown Washington, D.C.]]

Like the rest of [[Northern Virginia]], as well as [[Central Maryland]], modern Alexandria has been influenced by its proximity to the U.S. capital. It is largely populated by professionals working in the federal civil service, in the U.S. military, or for one of the many private companies which contract to provide services to the federal government. One of Alexandria's largest employers is the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]. Another is the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]]. In 2005, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] moved to Alexandria, and in 2017, so did the headquarters of the [[National Science Foundation]].

The historic center of Alexandria is known as "Old Town". With its concentration of boutiques, restaurants, [[antique shop]]s and theaters, it is a major draw for all who live in Alexandria as well for visitors. Like Old Town, many Alexandria neighborhoods are compact and walkable. It is the 7th largest and highest-income independent city in Virginia.

A large portion of adjacent [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], mostly south but also west of the city, is named "Alexandria," but it is under the jurisdiction of Fairfax County and separate from the city; the city is sometimes referred to as the City of Alexandria to avoid confusion (see the "Neighborhoods" paragraph below). In 1920, Virginia's General Assembly voted to incorporate what had been Alexandria County as [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] to minimize confusion.

{{Main|History of Alexandria, Virginia|Timeline of Alexandria, Virginia}}

=== Colonial era ===
[[File:1878 Alexandria County Virginia.jpg|thumb|alt=Map labeled "Alexandria County" on old yellowed paper, with Potomac River along upper right|Map of Alexandria County (1878), including what is now [[Arlington County]] and the City of Alexandria.

On October 21, 1669 a patent granted {{convert|6,000|acre|km2}} to Robert Howsing for transporting 120 people to the [[Colony of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Brockett and Rock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brockett|first1=Franklin Longdon|last2=Rock|first2=George W.|title=A Concise History of the City of Alexandria, Va: From 1669 to 1883, with a Directory of Reliable Business Houses in the City|date=1883|publisher=Gazette Book and Job office|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} That tract would later become the City of Alexandria.&lt;ref name="Brockett and Rock" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Virginia's comprehensive [[Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730|Tobacco Inspection Law of 1730]] mandated that all tobacco grown in the colony must be brought to locally designated public warehouses for inspection before sale. One of the sites designated for a warehouse on the upper [[Potomac River]] was at the mouth of [[Hunting Creek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tobacco.org/History/colonialtobacco.html |title=Economic Aspects of Tobacco during the Colonial Period 1612–1776 |website=Tobacco.org |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ground proved to be unsuitable, and the warehouse was built half a mile up-river, where the water was deep near the shore.

Following the 1745 settlement of the Virginia's 10 year dispute with Lord Fairfax over the western boundary of the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]], when the Privy Council in London found in favor of Lord Fairfax's expanded claim, some of the Fairfax County gentry formed the [[Ohio Company]] of Virginia. They intended to conduct trade into the interior of America, and they required a trading center near the head of navigation on the Potomac. The best location was Hunting Creek tobacco warehouse, since the deep water could easily accommodate sailing ships. Many local tobacco planters, however, wanted a new town further up Hunting Creek, away from nonproductive fields along the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=28266 |title=Discovering the Decades: 1740s &amp;#124; Historic Alexandria &amp;#124; City of Alexandria, VA |website=Alexandriava.gov |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1746, Captain [[Philip Alexander II]] (1704–1753) moved to what is south of present Duke Street in Alexandria. His estate, which consisted of {{convert|500|acre|km2}}, was bounded by Hunting Creek, Hooff's Run, the Potomac River, and approximately the line which would become Cameron Street. At the opening of Virginia's 1748–49 legislative session, there was a petition submitted in the [[House of Burgesses]] on November 1, 1748, that the "inhabitants of Fairfax (Co.) praying that a town may be established at Hunting Creek Warehouse on Potowmack River," as [[Hugh West]] was the owner of the warehouse. The petition was introduced by [[Lawrence Washington (1718–1752)]], the representative for Fairfax County and, more importantly, the son-in-law of [[William Fairfax]] and a founding member of the Ohio Company. To support the company's push for a town on the river, Lawrence's younger brother [[George Washington]], an aspiring surveyor, made a sketch of the shoreline touting the advantages of the tobacco warehouse site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/gwmaps.html|title=George Washington: Surveyor and Mapmaker|website=Loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the river site was amidst his estate, Philip opposed the idea and strongly favored a site at the head of Hunting Creek (also known as Great Hunting Creek). It has been said that in order to avoid a predicament the petitioners offered to name the new town ''Alexandria'', in honor of Philip's family. As a result, Philip and his cousin Captain [[John Alexander (captain)|John Alexander]] (1711–1763) gave land to assist in the development of Alexandria, and are thus listed as the founders. This John was the son of [[Robert Alexander II]] (1688–1735). On May 2, 1749, the House of Burgesses approved the river location and ordered "Mr. Washington do go up with a Message to the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Council]] and acquaint them that this House have agreed to the Amendments titled An Act for erecting a Town at Hunting Creek Warehouse, in the County of Fairfax."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Virginia. General Assembly. House of Burgesses|title=Journals of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, 1742–1747, 1748–1749|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_ktAAAAYAAJ|year=1909|publisher=Colonial Press, E. Waddey Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A "Public Vendue" (auction) was advertised for July, and the county surveyor laid out street lanes and town lots. The auction was conducted on July 13–14, 1749.

Almost immediately upon establishment, the town founders called the new town "Belhaven", believed to be in honor of a Scottish patriot, [[John Hamilton, 2nd Lord Belhaven and Stenton]], the Northern Neck tobacco trade being then dominated by Scots. The name Belhaven was used in official lotteries to raise money for a Church and Market House, but it was never approved by the legislature and fell out of favor in the mid-1750s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/va/richmondcity/newspapers/gazette5.txt|title=The Scheme of a Lottery, at Belhaven, in Fairfax County: January 24, 1750/51; Virginia Gazette extracts; The William and Mary Quarterly, Vol.12 No.2 (October 1903)|website=Files.usgwarchives.net|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Alexandria did not become incorporated until 1779.

In 1755, [[Edward Braddock|General Edward Braddock]] organized his fatal expedition against [[Fort Duquesne]] at [[Carlyle House]] in Alexandria. In April 1755, the governors of Virginia, and the provinces of [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], and [[Province of New York|New York]] met to determine upon concerted action against the [[Early Modern France|French]] in America.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=573}}

In March 1785, commissioners from Virginia and Maryland met in Alexandria to discuss the commercial relations of the two states, finishing their business at [[Mount Vernon]]. The [[Mount Vernon Conference]] concluded on March 28 with an agreement for freedom of trade and freedom of navigation of the Potomac River. The Maryland legislature, in ratifying this agreement on November 22, proposed a conference among representatives from all the states to consider the adoption of definite commercial regulations. This led to the calling of the [[Annapolis Convention of 1786]], which in turn led to the calling of the [[Federal Convention of 1787]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=573}}

In 1791, Alexandria was included in the area chosen by [[George Washington]] to become the District of Columbia.

In 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], a British fleet launched a successful [[Raid on Alexandria]], which surrendered without a fight. As agreed in the terms of surrender the British looted stores and warehouses of mainly flour, [[tobacco]], [[cotton]], [[wine]], and [[sugar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=28306 | title=Discovering the Decades: 1810s | publisher=Alexandria Archaeology Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823 [[William Holland Wilmer]], [[Francis Scott Key]], and others founded the [[Virginia Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cromey|first1=Robert Warren|title=Essays Irreverent|date=Sep 27, 2012|publisher=iUniverse|pages=184|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116}} From 1828 to 1836,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=31254#African_American | title=Self-Guided Walking Tour Black Historic Sites | publisher=Alexandria Black History Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandria was home to the [[Franklin &amp; Armfield]] Slave Market, one of the largest slave trading companies in the country. By the 1830s, they were sending more than 1,000 slaves annually from Alexandria to their [[Natchez, Mississippi]], and [[New Orleans]] markets to help meet the demand for slaves in Mississippi and surrounding states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jim Barnett and H.

A portion of the City of Alexandria—most of the area now known as "Old Town" as well as [[Boundary Markers of the Original District of Columbia|the areas of the city northeast of what is now King Street]]—and all of today's [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] share the distinction of having been the portion of Virginia ceded to the U.S. Government in 1791 to help form the new [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].  Over time, a movement grew to separate Alexandria from the District of Columbia. As competition grew with the port of [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] and the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] fostered development on the north side of the Potomac River, the city's economy stagnated; at the same time, residents had lost any representation in Congress and the right to vote, and were disappointed with the negligible economic benefit (on the Alexandria side) of being part of the national capital. Alexandria still had an important port and market in the [[slave trade]], and as talk increased of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolishing]] slavery in the national capital, there was concern that Alexandria's economy would suffer greatly if this step were taken. After a referendum, voters petitioned Congress and Virginia to return the portion of the District of Columbia south of the Potomac River (Alexandria County) to Virginia. On July 9, 1846, Congress [[District of Columbia retrocession|retroceded Alexandria County to Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymuseumdc.org/gettoknow/faq.asp |title=Get to know D.C. – Frequently Asked Questions About Washington, D.C. |publisher=History Society of Washington, D.C. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206013429/http://www.citymuseumdc.org/gettoknow/faq.asp |archivedate=February 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Alexandria was re-chartered in 1852 and became independent of [[Alexandria County, D.C.|Alexandria County]] in 1870. The remaining portion of Alexandria County changed its name to [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] in 1920.

The first fatalities of the North and South in the [[American Civil War]] occurred in Alexandria. Within a month of the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], Union troops occupied Alexandria, landing troops at the base of King Street on the Potomac River on May 24, 1861. A few blocks up King Street from their landing site, the commander of the [[11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|New York Fire Zouaves]], Colonel [[Elmer E. Ellsworth]], sortied with a small detachment to retrieve a large [[Confederate flag]] displayed on the roof of the [[Marshall House (Alexandria, Virginia)|Marshall House Inn]] that had been visible from the White House. While descending from the roof, Ellsworth was shot dead by Captain James W. Jackson, the hotel's proprietor. One of Ellsworth's soldiers immediately killed Jackson.&lt;ref name="sonofthesouth.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonofthesouth.net/leefoundation/civil-war/colonel-ellsworth-marshall-house.htm |title=Death of Colonel Ellsworth, Harper's Weekly (June 15, 1861) |website=Sonofthesouth.net |date=January 26, 2007 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellsworth was publicized as a Union martyr, and the incident generated great excitement in the North, with many children being named for him.&lt;ref name="sonofthesouth.net" /&gt; Jackson's death defending his home caused a similar, though less lasting sensation, in the South.

Alexandria remained under military occupation until the end of the war. [[Fort Ward (Virginia)|Fort Ward]], one of a ring of forts built by the Union army for the defense of [[Washington, D.C.]], is located inside the boundaries of present-day Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alexandriava.gov/FortWard|title= Fort Ward Museum|website=Alexandriava.gov|accessdate=September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the creation by Washington of the state of [[West Virginia]] in 1863 and until the close of the war, Alexandria was the seat of the so-called [[Restored Government of Virginia]], also known as the "Alexandria Government".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=573}} During the Union occupation, a recurring contention between the Alexandria citizenry and the military occupiers was the Union army's periodic insistence that church services include prayers for the President of the United States. Failure to do so resulted in incidents including the arrest of ministers in their church.

In 1861 and 1862, escaped [[African-American]] slaves poured into Alexandria. Safely behind Union lines, the cities of Alexandria and Washington offered comparative freedom and employment. Alexandria became a major supply depot and transport and hospital center for the Union army.&lt;ref name="Office of Historic Alexandria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alexandriava.gov/uploadedFiles/historic/info/archaeology/ARFreedmensHistoricalOverview.pdf |title=Office of Historic Alexandria, Alexandria Freedmen's Cemetery: Historical Overview, April 2007, p. 2. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324140231/http://alexandriava.gov/uploadedFiles/historic/info/archaeology/ARFreedmensHistoricalOverview.pdf |archivedate=March 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of January 1, 1863, escaped slaves legally remained the property of their owners. Therefore, they were labeled [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] to avoid returning them to their masters. Contrabands worked for the Union army in various support roles.

After all slaves in the seceding states were liberated, even more African Americans came to Alexandria. By the fall of 1863, the population of Alexandria had exploded to 18,000{{mdash}}an increase of 10,000 people in 16 months.&lt;ref name="Office of Historic Alexandria" /&gt;

As of ratification of [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|the Fifteenth Amendment]], Alexandria County's black population was more than 8,700, or about half the total number of residents in the county. This newly enfranchised constituency provided the support necessary to elect the first black Alexandrians to the City Council and the Virginia Legislature.&lt;ref name="alexandriaweba.com"&gt;[http://www.alexandriaweba.com/go/alexandriaafricanamericanhistory/freedmancemetery]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century the most common production in the city was glass, fertilizer, beer and leather. The glass often went into beer bottles. Much of the Virginia Glass Company effort went to supply the demands of the Robert Portner Brewing Company, until fire destroyed the St. Asaph Street plant on February 18, 1905.

=== History of libraries ===
John Wise, a local Alexandria businessman and hotel keeper, hosted a meeting in his home in 1789 to discuss the creation of a Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge. Members include Rev. James Muir, physician [[Elisha Cullen Dick]], and George Washington's personal attorney [[Charles Lee (Attorney General)|Charles Lee]]. The Society did not last for long. However, on July 24, 1794, the founders of the Society once again met at Wise's home to establish a subscription library. During the first year, one hundred nineteen men joined the circulating library which was to be called the Library Company of Alexandria. Members agreed to pay an initiation fee and annual dues. The company was chartered as a corporation in 1798 in an act passed by the [[General Assembly of Virginia]].

[[File:Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Shop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First city library location within an apothecary shop]]
Druggist Edward Stabler was elected the first librarian and the library's first location is believed to have been housed in his [[Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Shop|apothecary shop]]. James Kennedy was elected the second librarian, and the library moved to his residence and place of business. Kennedy sold books from his personal collection to the Library Company. Those books and other bought from two local merchants formed the foundation of the subscription library. The first catalog of the library's collection was published in 1797. The collection grew over time, bolstered in part by the fact that some members paid their dues in books. Most members were initially men, although records exist showing some women were members as early as 1798. One noted female member in 1817 was [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Mary L.F. Custis]], wife of [[George Washington Parke Custis]].

The catalog published in 1801 indicated a collection of 452 books, mostly on history and travel. By 1815, there were 1,022 entries in the catalog, and the collection had added more biographies, fiction, and magazines. The library was housed in several locations over the ensuing years, including the New Market House next to the City Hall, the [[Lyceum]] Company building, and Peabody Hall, which was owned by the Alexandria School Board. Raising funds for the library was a continuing challenge. In 1853, a lecture series was created to raise money. Speakers included Professor [[Joseph Henry]] of the Smithsonian, Colonel [[Francis H. Smith]] of the Virginia Military Institute, and humorist [[George W. Bagby]].

The arrival of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1861 took its toll on the library collection. Members were able to remove some of the collection prior to the library's occupation by Union troops. The library was used as a hospital and much of the library's collection was lost during this time. After the war, the building was sold to a private owner who planned to turn the building into a private residence and asked the library to remove what was left of the collection. Funds continued to be hard to come by and in 1879, the Library Company closed. The remainder of its collection was stored in Peabody Hall.

In 1897, a group of women in Alexandria formed the Alexandria Library Association. The leaders of the group were Virginia Corse, Mrs. William B. Smoot, and Virginia Burke. They petitioned the school board to open a subscription library in Peabody Hall, using the old books stored there. Permission was given and doors to the new subscription library opened on December 1, 1897. In 1902, the library moved to the first floor of a house in the 1300 block of Prince Street while negotiations were underway for a permanent move to the Confederate Hall, located at 806 Prince Street. In May 1903, the library moved to the Confederate Hall, now known as the Robert E. Lee Camp Hall Museum, where it stayed for 34 years.

In 1936, Dr. and Mrs. Robert South Barrett presented a proposal to the Library Association. They agreed to donate a building in memory of Dr. Barrett's mother, [[Kate Waller Barrett]], if the city would commit to running it as a public library. The city agreed and the Society of Friends offered a 99-year lease on an old Quaker graveyard located on Queen Street. The old library was closed on March 1 for the books to be packed and moved to the new library, which opened to the public in August 1937. The Alexandria Library Association became the Alexandria Library Society.

In 1939, the Barrett library was the scene of possibly [[Samuel Wilbert Tucker#Alexandria library sit-in|the nation's first sit-in demonstrations]], as [[Samuel Wilbert Tucker|Samuel Tucker]], a young law school graduate from the neighborhood, and several other African-American residents insisted on access to the racially segregated library where they had been banned.  Tucker later became a prominent attorney in Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jimcrowlivedhere.org/exhibits/show/1939-alexandria-library-sit-in |title=1939 Alexandria Library Sit-in |publisher=Jim Crow Lived Here |date= |accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alexandriahistoricalsociety.wildapricot.org/history |title=Alexandria Historical Society – Alexandria's History |website=Alexandriahistoricalsociety.wildapricot.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the Library Society was reconstituted and took the earlier historic name Alexandria Library Company. A lecture series was also revived. Speakers included [[Thomas Jefferson]] biographer [[Dumas Malone]]. Some of the books belonging in the original collection of the Alexandria Library Company can now be found in the Local History/Special Collections Room at the Queen Street library that still carries Mrs. Barrett's name.&lt;ref&gt;Seale, William. ''The Alexandria Library Company''. Alexandria, Virginia: Alexandria Library, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, [[Ellen Coolidge Burke]] became director. Burke brought [[bookmobile]] services to Alexandria, one of the first services in Virginia.  She oversaw the growth of the library system by the addition of two new branch libraries.  In April 1968 the Ellen Coolidge Burke Branch at 4701 Seminary Road was opened, and in December 1969 the [[James M. Duncan]] branch at 2501 Commonwealth Avenue.  Burke retired in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexandria.lib.va.us/client/en_US/home/;jsessionid=55F1FE7BBEDA3613D2634F145C817736.enterprise-23800?rm=ELLEN+COOLIDGE1%7C%7C%7C1%7C%7C%7C0%7C%7C%7Ctrue&amp;ic=true&amp;dt=list|title=Ellen Coolidge Burke|publisher=Alexandria Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The western portions of the city were annexed from those two entities beginning in the 1930s.

The [[address (geography)|addressing system]] in Alexandria is not uniform and reflects the consolidation of several originally separate communities into a single city. In Old Town Alexandria, building numbers are assigned north and south from [[King Street (Alexandria, Virginia)|King Street]] and west (only) from the Potomac River. In the areas formerly in the town of [[Potomac, Virginia|Potomac]], such as Del Ray and St. Elmo, building numbers are assigned east and west from Commonwealth Avenue and north (only) from King Street. In the western parts of the city, building numbers are assigned north and south from [[Virginia State Route 236|Duke Street]].

The [[ZIP code]] prefix 223 uniquely identifies the Alexandria postal area.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} However, the Alexandria postal area extends into [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and includes addresses outside of the city. Delivery areas have ZIP codes 22301, 22302, 22203, 22304, 22305, 22306, 22307, 22308, 22309, 22310, 22311, 22312, 22314, and 22315,  with other ZIP codes in use for [[post office box]]es and large mailers (22313, 22331, 22332, 22333).

In 1830, John Hollensbury's home in Alexandria was one of two homes directly bordering an [[alleyway]] that received a large amount of [[Horse-drawn vehicle|horse-drawn wagon]] traffic and loiterers.&lt;ref name="beloved"&gt;Bailey, Steve. (February 29, 2008) [[The New York Times]] ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/29/travel/escapes/29away.html A Tiny, Beloved Home That Was Built for Spite.]'' Section: F; Page F6. Location: 523 Queen St, Alexandria, VA 22314.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent people from using the alleyway, Hollensbury constructed a {{convert|7|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|25|ft|m}} deep, {{convert|325|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, two story home using the existing brick walls of the adjacent homes for the sides of the new home.&lt;ref name="beloved" /&gt; The brick walls of the [[spite house|Hollensbury Spite House]] living room have gouges from wagon-wheel hubs; the house is still standing, and is occupied.&lt;ref name="beloved" /&gt;

== Sports ==
Due to its proximity to Washington, Alexandria has only been the home of one professional sports team, the [[Alexandria Dukes]], a minor league baseball team which has moved to [[Woodbridge, Virginia|Woodbridge]] and is now named the [[Potomac Nationals]]. However, the [[Cal Ripken Collegiate Baseball League]] brought baseball back to Alexandria in 2008 in the form of the [[Alexandria (VA) Aces|Alexandria Aces]]. In addition, TC Williams, Bishop Ireton, St. Stephen's and Episcopal have storied histories in athletics, such as football, basketball, baseball and lacrosse. The largest youth sport in Alexandria is soccer with almost 2,500 players ages 2–18 who participate in the Alexandria Soccer Association.

== Parks and recreation ==
Alexandria has a distributed park system with approximately {{convert|950|acre|km2}} spread across 70 major parks and 30 [[recreation]] centers, of which [[Castanea pumila|Chinquapin]] is one of the largest. Chinquapin offers facilities for swimming, tennis, racquetball, and other sports. The city also organizes several sports leagues throughout the year including volleyball, softball and basketball.

The city is home to [[Cameron Run Regional Park]] which includes a water park with a [[wave pool]] and [[water slide]]s, as well as a [[miniature golf]] course and batting cages. A portion of the [[Mount Vernon Trail]], a popular bike and jogging path, runs through Old Town near the Potomac River on its way from the Mount Vernon Estate to Roosevelt Island in Washington, DC. There is also a largely unbroken line of parks stretching along the Alexandria waterfront from end to end.

As an independent city of Virginia (as opposed to an incorporated town within a county), Alexandria derives its governing authority from the [[Virginia General Assembly]]. In order to revise the power and structure of the city government, the city must request the General Assembly to amend the charter. The present charter was granted in 1950 and it has been amended in 1968, 1971, 1976, and 1982.

Alexandria adopted a [[council-manager]] form of government by way of referendum in 1921. This type of government empowers the elected City Council to pass legislation and appoint the City Manager. The City Manager is responsible for overseeing the city's administration.

The Mayor, who is chosen on a separate ballot, presides over meetings of the Council and serves as the ceremonial head of government. The Mayor does not have the power to veto Council action. Council members traditionally choose the person receiving the most votes in the election to serve as Vice Mayor. In the absence or disability of the Mayor, the Vice Mayor performs the mayoral duties.

In 2008, the City of Alexandria had 78 standing local boards, commissions, and committees to advise the City Council on major issues affecting the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.alexandriava.gov/bcroster/bc_list.pxe |title=Roster of Alexandria Boards, Commissions and Committees |website=Alexandriava.gov |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; All members are appointed by the City Council.
&lt;!--say, Alexandrians, isn't 78 boards &amp;c. a bit much? --&gt;

Alexandria is part of [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]], represented by Democrat and Alexandria resident [[Don Beyer]], elected in 2014.

The state's senior member of the United States Senate is Democrat [[Mark Warner]], elected in 2008. The state's junior member of the United States Senate is Democrat [[Tim Kaine]], elected in 2012.

The city operates a jail for pre-trial and short-term inmates. This jail is used to house pre-trial inmates in federal espionage cases.&lt;ref&gt;Wise, David.

=== Schools ===
[[File:NVCC - Alexandria campus.jpg|thumb|alt=Big street with cars waiting at intersection|Entrance to [[Northern Virginia Community College]]'s Alexandria campus]]
The city is served by the [[Alexandria City Public Schools]] system and by the Alexandria campus of [[Northern Virginia Community College]]. The largest seminary in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], [[Virginia Theological Seminary]], is located on Seminary Road. [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech's]] Washington-Alexandria Architecture Center, also known as WAAC, is located on Prince Street in Old Town, offering graduate programs in Urban Affairs and Planning, Public and International Affairs, Architecture, and Landscape Architecture. [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] operates a Northern Virginia branch of its School of Social Work and [[The George Washington University]] (Washington DC) also has a campus near the King Street metro. This campus mainly offers professional and vocational programs, such as an executive MBA program, urban planning and security studies.

Alexandria has several of the Washington, D.C., area's top private schools, such as [[St. Stephen's and St. Agnes School]], [[Bishop Ireton High School]], and [[Episcopal High School (Alexandria, Virginia)|Episcopal High School]]. Also in the city are Alexandria Country Day School, Commonwealth Academy, St. Mary's Catholic School, St. Rita's Catholic School, Blessed Sacrament School and [[Global Health College]].

Alexandria's public school system consists of thirteen elementary schools for grades 5-year-old Kindergarten through Grade 5. Middle Schools, George Washington and Francis C. Hammond, serve 6th through 8th graders. Minnie Howard Ninth Grade Center and [[T.C. Williams High School]] serve grades 9th and 10 through 12, respectively, for the entire city.

The demographics of Alexandria City Public Schools contrast with those of the city. In 2008, only 14% of the students at Francis C. Hammond Middle School were non-Hispanic whites, compared to about 60% when looking at the city as a whole. 27% were of Hispanic descent, and 48% were black. About 9% of the school was of Asian descent. In 2004, 62% of the schoolgoing children received free lunches; by 2008, that number had decreased to 56%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestplaces.net/school/SchoolStats.aspx?uid=5100069&amp;udid=15100030|title=Best Places to Live in the United States|website=Bestplaces.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; At George Washington Middle School, 41% of students are non-Hispanic whites, 34% were Hispanic, and 21% was black; 2% of the students were Asian, and 52% of students received free lunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestplaces.net/school/SchoolStats.aspx?uid=5100071&amp;udid=15100030|title=Best Places to Live in the United States|website=Bestplaces.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; T.C. Williams High School follows this trend as well; 23% of the students were classified as non-Hispanic whites, 25% as Hispanic, and 44% as black. 7% of the school was Asian, and 47% of all students received free lunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestplaces.net/school/SchoolStats.aspx?uid=5100080&amp;udid=15100030|title=Best Places to Live in the United States|website=Bestplaces.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transportation ===
[[File:Amtrak 82 at Alexandria Union Station in 2007.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Big shiny train facing us, at station with passengers on platform|Southbound [[Amtrak]] train at Alexandria's Union Station]]
Alexandria is bisected east and west by [[State Route 7 (Virginia)|State Route 7]], known as [[King Street, Alexandria, Virginia|King Street]]. The most western section of King St here once was the terminus of the Leesburg Turnpike. Interstate 95/495 (the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]]), including the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the Potomac River, approximately parallels the city's southern boundary with Fairfax County. [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] crosses north and south through the western part of the city. Other major routes include north–south [[U.S. Route 1 in Virginia|U.S. 1]] (Patrick and Henry Streets after [[Patrick Henry]], [[Jefferson Davis Highway#Virginia|Jefferson Davis Highway]] and Richmond Highway), Washington St/[[George Washington Memorial Parkway]], Russell Rd, Quaker Lane, Van Dorn St and Beauregard St, and east–west Duke Street ([[State Route 236 (Virginia)|State Route 236]]), Braddock Rd and Janneys Lane/Seminary Rd.

Alexandria is south of, adjacent to [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] in Arlington County. Alexandria is also near to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Dulles, Virginia]].

[[Union Station (Alexandria)|Alexandria Union Station]], the city's historic train station, has [[Amtrak]] intercity services and the [[Virginia Railway Express]] regional rail service. The station is directly adjacent to the [[King Street – Old Town (WMATA station)|King Street – Old Town]] [[Washington Metro]] station, at the convergence of the [[Blue Line (Washington Metro)|Blue]] and [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow Lines]]. Three other Metro stations in Alexandria are [[Braddock Road (Washington Metro)|Braddock Road]], [[Van Dorn Street (Washington Metro)|Van Dorn Street]], and [[Eisenhower Avenue (Washington Metro)|Eisenhower Avenue]].

The traditional boundary between Old Town and the latterly annexed sections of the city followed the railway now owned by [[CSX Transportation]].

The city government operates its own mass transit system, the [[DASH (bus)|DASH]] bus, connecting points of interest with local transit hubs. [[Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)|Metrobus]], [[Washington Metro]], and the [[Virginia Railway Express]], better known as the VRE, also serve Alexandria. The city also offers a free "trolley" diesel bus service on King Street from the King Street Metro Station to the Waterfront&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dashbus.com/Trolley|title=DASH : King Street Trolley – FREE|website=Dashbus.com|accessdate=February 12, 2015|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150209153908/http://www.dashbus.com/Trolley|archive-date=February 9, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a water taxi to and from the [[National Harbor]] development in Prince George's County, Maryland.

Until 2014, local legislation mandated that all new north/south streets in the city be named for Confederate military leaders.&lt;ref name=WBJ&gt;[https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/breaking_ground/2015/09/how-many-confederacy-tied-alexandria-streets-can.html Will Alexandria take action on its Confederacy-tied street names?

The avant-garde pushes the boundaries of what is accepted as the [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] or the [[status quo]], primarily in the cultural realm. The avant-garde is considered by some to be a hallmark of [[modernism]], as distinct from [[postmodernism]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. Many [[artists]] have aligned themselves with the avant-garde movement and still continue to do so, tracing a history from [[Dada]] through [[Situationist International|the Situationists]] to postmodern artists such as the [[Language poets]] around 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubu.com/ UBU Web] List of artists from Dada to the present day aligning themselves with the avant-garde&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2016}}

The avant-garde also promotes radical social reforms. It was this meaning that was evoked by the [[Saint Simonian]] [[Olinde Rodrigues]] in his essay "L'artiste, le savant et l'industriel" ("The artist, the scientist and the industrialist", 1825), which contains the first recorded use of "avant-garde" in its now customary sense: there, Rodrigues calls on artists to "serve as [the people's] avant-garde", insisting that "the power of the arts is indeed the most immediate and fastest way" to social, political and economic reform.&lt;ref&gt;Matei Calinescu, ''[https://www.dukeupress.edu/five-faces-of-modernity/ The Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-Garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism]'' (Durham: [[Duke University Press]], 1987), {{Page needed|date=May 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]],'', 1917, photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]

Several writers have attempted to map the parameters of avant-garde activity. The Italian essayist [[Renato Poggioli]] provides one of the earliest analyses of vanguardism as a cultural phenomenon in his 1962 book ''Teoria dell'arte d'avanguardia'' (''The Theory of the Avant-Garde'').&lt;ref&gt;Sascha Bru and Gunther Martens, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=suPzDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 The Invention of Politics in the European Avant-Garde (1906–1940)]'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2006), p. 21. {{ISBN|9042019093}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying the historical, social, psychological and philosophical aspects of [[vanguardism]], Poggioli reaches beyond individual instances of art, poetry, and music to show that vanguardists may share certain ideals or values which manifest themselves in the non-conformist lifestyles they adopt: He sees  vanguard culture as a variety or subcategory of [[Bohemianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Renato Poggioli|title=The Theory of the Avant-Garde |publisher=Belknap Press of [[Harvard University Press]]| year = 1968 | isbn = 0-674-88216-4 |page=11}}, translated from the Italian by Gerald Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have attempted both to clarify and to extend Poggioli's study. The [[Germans|German]] literary critic Peter Bürger's ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'' (1974) looks at [[the Establishment]]'s embrace of socially critical works of art and suggests that in complicity with capitalism, "art as an institution neutralizes the political content of the individual work".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Peter Bürger|title=Theorie der Avantgarde|publisher=Suhrkamp Verlag|year=1974}} English translation (University of Minnesota Press) 1984: 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bürger's essay also greatly influenced the work of contemporary American art-historians such as the German [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]] (born 1941). Buchloh, in the collection of essays ''Neo-avantgarde and Culture Industry'' (2000) critically argues for a dialectical approach to these positions.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Buchloh, ''Neo-avantgarde and Culture Industry: Essays on European and American Art from 1955 to 1975'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2001) {{ISBN|0-262-02454-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent criticism theorized the limitations of these approaches, noting their circumscribed areas of analysis, including Eurocentric, chauvinist, and genre-specific definitions.&lt;ref&gt;

==Relation to mainstream society==
{{See|Mainstream}}
{{see also|Media culture|Spectacle (critical theory)}}
The concept of avant-garde refers primarily to artists, writers, composers and thinkers whose work is opposed to mainstream cultural values and often has a trenchant social or political edge. Many writers, critics and theorists made assertions about vanguard culture during the formative years of modernism, although the initial definitive statement on the avant-garde was the essay ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]'' by New York art critic [[Clement Greenberg]], published in ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Greenberg |first= Clement|date=Fall 1939 |title=Avant-Garde and Kitsch |url=http://hgar-srv3.bu.edu/collections/partisan-review/search/detail?id=283920 |magazine=The Partisan Review |pages=34-49 |volume=6 |issue=5 |access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg argued that vanguard culture has historically been opposed to "high" or "mainstream" culture, and that it has also rejected the artificially synthesized [[mass culture]] that has been produced by industrialization. Each of these media is a direct product of [[Capitalism]]—they are all now substantial industries—and as such they are driven by the same profit-fixated motives of other sectors of manufacturing, not the ideals of true art. For Greenberg, these forms were therefore ''[[kitsch]]'': phony, faked or mechanical culture, which often pretended to be more than they were by using formal devices stolen from vanguard culture. For instance, during the 1930s the advertising industry was quick to take visual mannerisms from [[surrealism]], but this does not mean that 1930s advertising photographs are truly surreal.

[[File:AdornoHorkheimerHabermasbyJeremyJShapiro2.png|thumb|right|[[Max Horkheimer]] (front left), [[Theodor Adorno]] (front right), and [[Jürgen Habermas]] in the background, right, in 1965 at [[Heidelberg]], [[West Germany]].]]

Various members of the [[Frankfurt School]] argued similar views: thus [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer]] in their essay ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment|The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass-Deception]]'' (1944), and also [[Walter Benjamin]] in his highly influential "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1935, rev. 1939).&lt;ref&gt;Walter Benjamin, "[http://bid.berkeley.edu/bidclass/readings/benjamin.html The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205013822/http://bid.berkeley.edu/bidclass/readings/benjamin.html |date=5 December 2006 }}{{Full citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;!--Place, publisher, translator, etc. needed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Where Greenberg used the German word ''[[kitsch]]'' to describe the antithesis of avant-garde culture, members of the Frankfurt School coined the term "[[mass culture]]" to indicate that this bogus culture is constantly being manufactured by a newly emerged [[culture industry]] (comprising commercial publishing houses, the movie industry, the record industry, and the electronic media).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/adorno_culture_reconsidered.pdf Theodor W. Adorno (1963)], "[[Culture Industry Reconsidered]]: Selected Essays on Mass Culture", London: Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; They also pointed out that the rise of this industry meant that artistic excellence was displaced by sales figures as a measure of worth: a novel, for example, was judged meritorious solely on whether it became a best-seller, music succumbed to ratings charts and to the blunt commercial logic of the Gold disc. In this way the autonomous artistic merit so dear to the vanguardist was abandoned and sales increasingly became the measure, and justification, of everything. Consumer culture now ruled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The avant-garde's [[Recuperation (politics)|co-option]] by the global capitalist market, by [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economies, and by what [[Guy Debord]] called ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', have made contemporary critics speculate on the possibility of a meaningful avant-garde today. Paul Mann's ''Theory-Death of the Avant-Garde'' demonstrates how completely the avant-garde is embedded within institutional structures today, a thought also pursued by [[Richard Schechner]] in his analyses of avant-garde performance.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Schechner, "The Conservative Avant-Garde." ''New Literary History'' 41.4 (Autumn 2010): 895–913.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the central arguments of Greenberg, Adorno and others, various sectors of the mainstream culture industry have co-opted and misapplied the term "avant-garde" since the 1960s, chiefly as a marketing tool to publicise popular music and commercial cinema. It has become common to describe successful rock musicians and celebrated film-makers as "avant-garde", the very word having been stripped of its proper meaning. Noting this important conceptual shift, major contemporary theorists such as [[Matei Calinescu]] in ''Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism'' (1987),{{page needed|date=September 2012}} and Hans Bertens in ''The Idea of the Postmodern: A History'' (1995),{{page needed|date=September 2012}} have suggested that this is a sign our culture has entered a new [[post-modern]] age, when the former [[modernist]] ways of thinking and behaving have been rendered redundant.&lt;ref&gt;Calinescu 1987,{{page needed|date=September 2012}}; Bertens 1995.{{page needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, an incisive critique of vanguardism as against the views of mainstream society was offered by the New York critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The De-Definition of Art: Action Art to Pop to Earthworks'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983), p. 219 {{ISBN|0-226-72673-8}}. Originally published: New York: Horizon Press, 1972; reprinted New York: Collier Books, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to strike a balance between the insights of Renato Poggioli and the claims of Clement Greenberg, Rosenberg suggested that from the mid-1960s onward progressive culture ceased to fulfill its former adversarial role. Since then it has been flanked by what he called "avant-garde ghosts to the one side, and a changing mass culture on the other", both of which it interacts with to varying degrees. This has seen culture become, in his words, "a profession one of whose aspects is the pretense of overthrowing it".&lt;ref&gt;George Dickie, "[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Arts/Arts-idx?type=turn&amp;id=Arts.ArtsSocv12i2&amp;entity=Arts.ArtsSocv12i2.p0074&amp;isize=text "Symposium on Marxist Aesthetic Thought: Commentary on the Papers by Rudich, San Juan, and Morawski]", ''Arts in Society: Art and Social Experience: Our Changing Outlook on Culture'' 12, no. 2 (Summer–Fall 1975): p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Music===
{{Main article|Avant-garde music}}
Avant-garde in music can refer to any form of music working within traditional structures while seeking to breach boundaries in some manner.&lt;ref name=iha&gt;David Nicholls (ed.), ''The Cambridge History of American Music'' (Cambridge and New York: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1998), 122–24. {{ISBN|0-521-45429-8}} {{ISBN|978-0-521-54554-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used loosely to describe the work of any musicians who radically depart from tradition altogether.&lt;ref name="Samson"&gt;Jim Samson, "Avant garde", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; By this definition, some avant-garde composers of the 20th century include [[Arnold Schoenberg]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiv"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xiv. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Ives]],&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), 222. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiv" /&gt; [[Anton Webern]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_50"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), 50. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Antheil]] (in his earliest works only), [[Alban Berg]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_50" /&gt; [[Henry Cowell]] (in his earliest works), [[Philip Glass]], [[Harry Partch]], [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Richard Strauss]] (in his earliest work),&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiii"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xiii–xiv. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]],&lt;ref&gt;Elliot Schwartz, Barney Childs, and James Fox (eds.), ''Contemporary Composers on Contemporary Music'' (New York: Da Capo Press, 1998), 379. {{ISBN|0-306-80819-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edgard Varèse]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]].&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiv" /&gt; Although most avant-garde composers have been men, this is not exclusively the case. Women avant-gardists include [[Pauline Oliveros]], [[Diamanda Galás]], [[Meredith Monk]], and [[Laurie Anderson]].&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xvii"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xvii. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another definition of "Avant-gardism" that distinguishes it from "modernism": Peter Bürger, for example, says avant-gardism rejects the "institution of art" and challenges social and artistic values, and so necessarily involves political, social, and cultural factors.&lt;ref name="Samson" /&gt; According to the composer and musicologist [[Larry Sitsky]], modernist composers from the early 20th century who do not qualify as avant-gardists include Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, and Igor Stravinsky; later modernist composers who do not fall into the category of avant-gardists include [[Elliott Carter]], [[Milton Babbitt]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Witold Lutosławski]], and [[Luciano Berio]], since "their modernism was not conceived for the purpose of goading an audience."&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xv"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xv. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Experimental theatre}}

Whereas the avant-garde has a significant history in 20th-century music, it is more pronounced in theatre and performance art, and often in conjunction with music and sound design innovations, as well as developments in visual media design. There are movements in theatre history that are characterized by their contributions to the avant-garde traditions in both the United States and Europe. Among these are [[Fluxus]], [[Happenings]], and [[Neo-Dada]].

The '''Bronze baptismal font''' ([[German language|German]]: Bronzetaufe) in the [[Hildesheim Cathedral]] is a late [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[baptismal font]] which was probably made in Hildesheim in the first third of the thirteenth century. It is noted for its pictorial decoration which is of the highest quality and for its perfect proportions and is considered among the most outstanding works of its type. For centuries the baptismal font stood in the western part of the nave, until it was moved to the last of the northern side-chapels (George's chapel) in 1653. During the ongoing renovations of the cathedral (2010–2014) it is being displayed in the [[Bode Museum]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.domsanierung.de/de/taufbecken the website of the diocese].&lt;/ref&gt; After the completion of the renovation work, it will be placed in the centre of the nave under the [[Hezilo chandelier]].
 
== Description ==
The font is made up of a round pot, which widens towards the top, a tapering lid with four allegorical figures and a bauble on top. It has a total height of 1.7 m and a diameter of 96&amp;nbsp;cm.

The lively decorative style foreshadows [[Gothic art]], but also shows a [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] influence, especially in the architectural elements. The postures and faces of the figures are especially emotionally expressive.

== Image program ==
The image program, divided into three horizontal bands and four vertical columns, is of great symbolic significance. The imagery can be interpreted on a number of levels and offers an ascetic and biblical understanding of the font overall. The imagers are further explained by [[Latin]] titles and inscriptions.

The lowest band shows four human figures, which support the whole font. These are personifications of the four rivers of the [[Garden of Eden]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Genesis|chapter=2|verse=10|range=–14}}). Each of them pours out the water of life: at baptism what was dried up by sin, begins to flow once more. The four figures are clearly distinct in clothing, posture, and hairstyle and symbolise different classes and phases of life. In a small area above their heads, they are identified with the [[cardinal virtues]]: moderation, valor, justice, and wisdom. In this respect, the armour worn by the figure labelled as valour is particularly notable. The natural virtues were meant to be brought to fulfillment by the act of baptism.

The second level, on the body of the font, shows the most significant aspects of baptism with four scenes from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Hildesheim Dom Taufe 03.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Mary with child (donor portrait)&lt;/center&gt;
File:Hildesheim Dom Taufe 04.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Parting the Red Sea&lt;/center&gt;
File:Hildesheim Dom Taufe 05.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Crossing the Jordan&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* The [[baptism of Jesus]] indicates that the experience of the baptised is shared with Christ, as is death and resurrection ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=6|verse=3|range=–8}}). 
* The image of Mary with the baby Jesus on the opposite side places Jesus' mother before the eyes of the baptised; by their baptism she becomes their mother and advocate. She is depicted with the other patrons of the cathedral, [[Epiphanius of Pavia]] and [[Godehard of Hildesheim]], symbolising the [[Communion of saints]] to which the baptised now belonged. This scene is probably also the [[donor portrait]], since a small figure, whose name is given as "Wilbern" kneels at Mary's feet. This is probably [[Wilbrand van Oldenburg]] who was canon of Hildesheim Cathedral at the time the font was made.
* The depiction of the Israelites, indicated by their [[Jewish hat]]s, [[crossing the Red Sea]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Exodus|chapter=14}}) with [[Moses]], connects the immersion and emergence from the baptismal font with the peril, salvation, and freeing of Israel and through that connection declares all the baptised to be members of God's [[chosen people]], on their way to the [[Promised Land]].
* The fourth image shows the return to the Promised Land by fording the [[River Jordan]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Joshua|chapter=3}}). Everyone helps to carry the [[Ark of the Covenant]] which contains the [[Ten commandments]] they received at Sinai. This symbolises the duty of the baptised to the one God and his will, which is contained in the covenant of baptism.

The next layer up is the four scenes on the lid. They present the significance of baptism for the Christian life.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Hildesheim Dom Taufe 06.jpg|&lt;center&gt;The Anointing of Jesus&lt;/center&gt;
File:Hildesheim Dom Taufe 07.jpg|&lt;center&gt;The blossoming of Aaron's rod&lt;/center&gt;
File:Hildesheim Dom Taufe 08.jpg|&lt;center&gt;The Massacre of the Innocents&lt;/center&gt;
File:Hildesheim Dom Taufe 09.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Personification of Mercy&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* The image of the [[Anointing of Jesus]] by the prostitute (traditionally equated with [[Mary Magdalene]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=7|verse=36|range=–59}}) demonstrates remorse and repentance, as well as the inexhaustibility of [[Divine Grace|Grace]] and the love originating from it.
* The blossoming of [[Aaron's rod]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Numbers|chapter=17}}) opposite, symbolised Mary's fruitful [[virginity]] and the [[chastity]] of the baptised.
* The [[Massacre of the Innocents]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew|chapter=2|verse=16|range=–18}}) recalls the fellowship shared by all the baptised with Christ in witnessing their faith ([[Greek language|Greek]] μαρτύριον) and the possibility of the [[Christian martyrs|baptism of blood]].
* The personification of ''Misericordia'' finally, a woman enthroned as a queen, performing [[Works of Mercy]], shows how the grace of baptism concretely effects life.

Vertically, the baptism of Christ correlates with his anointment by the prostitute, the Mother of God with the staff of Aaron, the Exodus with the Massacre of the Innocents and the Ark of the Covenant with the personification of Mercy.

Narrow columns rise up from the personifications of the rivers in between the scenes, which support triple arches above each scene. Their bases name the cardinal virtues and they show further biblical figures in the spaces between scenes above their capitals (sometimes the same figures are repeated), with the animals symbolising each of the evangelists above these spaces on the main body of the font:  
* Moderation - [[Jeremiah]] - [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] - Jeremiah
* Valour - [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] - [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] - King [[David]]
* Justice - [[Ezekiel]] - [[John the Evangelist|John]] - [[Isaiah]]
* Wisdom - Isaiah- [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] - King [[Solomon]].
These arrangements are also significant.

The '''Emancipation Statue''' is a public [[sculpture]] symbolising the "breaking of the chains" of slavery at Emancipation. It is located in [[Barbados]], east of [[Bridgetown]] at centre of the J.T.C. Ramsay roundabout formed at the junction of the [[ABC Highway]] and Highway 5.  Many Barbadians refer to the statue as [[Bussa]], the name of a slave who helped inspire a revolt against slavery in Barbados in 1816, though the statue is not actually sculpted to be Bussa.

The statue, made of bronze, was created in 1985 by [[Barbadian people|Bajan]] sculptor [[Karl Broodhagen]] 169 years after the rebellion.

This was the chant of thousands of Barbadians when apprenticeship was abolished in 1838, signifying their freedom and happiness.

'''''Catch Me If You Can''''' is the semi-[[autobiography]] of [[Frank Abagnale Jr.]], a former con artist who, as a young man, cashed [[United States dollar|$]]2.5 million worth of bad checks while impersonating a [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] pilot, a doctor, a teacher, and an attorney. The book is co-written by Stan Redding, and was adapted into a [[Catch Me If You Can|2002 film of the same name]] by director [[Steven Spielberg]], starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Abagnale and [[Tom Hanks]] as the FBI agent who pursued him.

== Plot summary ==
{{hatnote|For the movie plot, see [[Catch Me If You Can#Plot]].}}
The book details the life of Frank Abagnale, who was one of the most famous con-artists in the 20th century. It is written in the [[First-person narrative|first person]] and describes how he cashed $2.5 million worth of bad checks. He assumed various jobs, such as pretending to be a Pan Am pilot, a doctor, a teacher, and an attorney. Abagnale was eventually caught by the FBI Agents, who had been chasing him the whole way, while living in France and then served approximately five years in prison&amp;nbsp;— six months in France, six months in [[Sweden]], and four years in the United States. The book ends with an epilogue telling the story of Frank Abagnale's final capture and the story of his rehabilitation, which resulted in the creation of his security firm.

== Plot ==
Frank W. Abagnale is devastated when his parents decide to divorce. He runs away from home and starts cashing fake checks. He's only 16 years old but he looks 26. He uses this in his advantage by pretending to be a 26 year old. Soon he decides he can't stay in New York, because the banks in New York start to ask questions about him cashing in checks from an empty bank account. He goes to the airport and does some research. After some time he is able to fake a pilot license. Frank abuses the right pilots have to fly for free. He travels throughout the United States and cashes fraudulent checks everywhere, in every city he passes. During his adventures he makes many friends and girlfriends. In some cities he stays for a few days, in others he stays longer.

Eventually, Abagnale settles in the city of River Bend. Here he has a very curious neighbor, and to avoid questions, he says he's a doctor. This is a mistake: His neighbor is also a doctor. Immediately, he makes a fake doctor's license, which later comes in handy. After some time they become friends and Frank goes to the hospital. There he is welcomed warmly; soon, he begins spending a lot of time in the hospital. In the hospital he meets Brenda Strong, whom he starts dating. His relationship with Brenda is different from other relationships he has had. Frank soon realizes he can't stay in River Bend because the FBI is getting closer every day. He continues his journey in the United States. At a particular moment he also fakes a Harvard diploma to pose as an attorney. A few months later he starts feeling the urge to cross the Atlantic and go to Europe.

Frank forges a passport and flies to France. In Europe, he continues traveling and forging and cashing checks. Later, when he goes back to the United States, he goes to a flight attendant school and makes his own fake crew: He tells the students he needs a new crew to take pictures for advertising. With his crew, he feels confident enough to cash even bigger checks. When his crew leaves and he restarts his con, the police gets closer to finding Frank. When he gets caught by the French police he goes to [[Perpignan|Perpignan's]] prison, where he is held in a very small, dark and inhumane cell. After getting released he is extradited to Sweden, where he gets a very comfortable cell at the [[Malmö]] prison. After staying there for six months he returns to the United States. Once back in the United States he escapes from prison twice, but is caught both times. He serves four years of his 12-year sentence in prison.

After being released, Frank has a hard time finding a job. He figures he should use his talents for a new job and starts his own firm. He now visits banks to teach the personnel how to recognize fraudulent checks.

=== Veracity ===
In 2002, Abagnale addressed the issue of the book's truthfulness with a statement posted on his company's website which said (in part): "I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also over-dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography." Specifically he addressed details such as the amount of money he wrote in bad checks, and the years in which his crimes took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Abagnale &amp; Associates, Comments| url=http://www.abagnale.com/comments.htm | access-date=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movie adaptation ==
The 2002 film ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', directed by award-winning director [[Steven Spielberg]], stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Abagnale and [[Tom Hanks]] as Hanratty. The film is based upon his life and the autobiography and is mainly true to the source as Abagnale was a consultant to the writers, but some of the details were changed to create a more dramatic narrative for film.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-06-052971-7}} by [[Frank Abagnale]], Jr. and Stan Redding&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical adaptation==
Abagnale's life has been adapted into a musical [[Catch Me If You Can (musical)|of the same name]], which previewed on March 11, 2011, and opened on April 10 at the [[Neil Simon Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].  The show stars [[Aaron Tveit]], [[Norbert Leo Butz]], [[Tom Wopat]] and [[Kerry Butler]]. Butz won the [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical]] at the [[65th Tony Awards]] in 2011.

'''''Chinoiserie''''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ʃ|ɪ|n|ˈ|w|ɑː|z|ər|i|}}, {{IPA-fr|ʃinwazʁi|lang}}; [[loanword]] from French ''[[wikt:chinoiserie#French|chinoiserie]]'', from ''[[wikt:chinois#French|chinois]]'', "Chinese") is the [[Europe]]an interpretation and imitation of [[China|Chinese]] and [[East Asia]]n artistic traditions, especially in the [[decorative arts]], [[garden design]], [[architecture]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/31805?redirectedFrom=Chinoiserie#eid9510224|title = Chinois|publisher = [[The Oxford English Dictionary]]|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic of Chinoiserie has been expressed in different ways depending on the region. Its acknowledgement derives from the current of [[Orientalism]], which studied Far East cultures from a historical, philological, anthropological, philosophical and religious point of view. First appearing in the 17th century, this trend was popularized in the 18th century due to the rise in trade with China and East Asia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chinese Whispers: Chinoiserie in Britain, 1650–1930|last = Beevers|first = David|publisher = Royal Pavilion &amp; Museums|year = 2009|isbn = 0-948723-71-8|location = Brighton|pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a style, chinoiserie is related to the [[Rococo]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/style-guide-chinoiserie/|title=Style Guide: Chinoiserie|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Digital Media|last=webmaster@vam.ac.uk|date=|website=www.vam.ac.uk|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both styles are characterized by exuberant decoration, asymmetry, a focus on materials, and stylized nature and subject matter that focuses on leisure and pleasure. Chinoiserie focuses on subjects that were thought by [[colonialism|colonial-era]] Europeans to be typical of [[Chinese culture]].

== History ==
[[File:Kew Gardens Pagoda.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[William Chambers (architect)|Sir William Chambers]]' Pagoda at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanic Gardens]] at [[Kew]], [[London]]]]
[[File:Le Jardin chinois (detail) by François Boucher.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The Chinese Garden'', a chinoiserie painting by [[François Boucher]]]]
{{further|Orientalism in early modern France}}
Chinoiserie entered European art and decoration in the mid-to-late 17th century; the work of [[Athanasius Kircher#Sinology|Athanasius Kircher]] influenced the study of [[orientalism]]. The popularity of chinoiserie peaked around the middle of the 18th century when it was associated with the [[rococo]] style and with works by [[François Boucher]], [[Thomas Chippendale]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Pillement|Jean-Baptist Pillement.]] It was also popularized by the influx of Chinese and Indian goods brought annually to Europe aboard [[East India Company|English]], [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]], [[French East India Company|French]], and [[Swedish East India Company|Swedish East India Companies]].Though chinoiserie never fully went out of fashion, it declined in Europe by the 1760s when the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style gained popularity, though remained popular in the newly formed United States through the early 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} There was a revival of popularity for chinoiserie in Europe and the United States from the mid-19th century through the 1920s, and today in elite interior design and fashion.

Though usually understood as a European style, chinoiserie was a global phenomenon. Local versions of chinoiserie were developed in India, Japan, Persia, and particularly Latin America. Through the [[Manila Galeon Trade|Manila Galleon Trade]], Spanish traders brought large amounts of Chinese porcelain, lacquer, textiles, and spices from Chinese merchants based in [[Manila]] to New Spanish markets in Acapulco, Panama, and [[Lima]]. Those products then inspired local artists and artisans such as ceramicists making [[Talavera pottery]] at Puebla de Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/made-in-the-americas-the-new-world-discovers-asia/oclc/916494129|title=Made in the Americas: the new world discovers Asia|last=Carr|first=Dennis|last2=Bailey|first2=Gauvin A|last3=Brook|first3=Timothy|last4=Codding|first4=Mitchell|last5=Corrigan|first5=Karina|last6=Pierce|first6=Donna|last7=Museum of Fine Arts|first7=Boston|date=2015-01-01|isbn=978-0-87846-812-6|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popularization ==
There were many reasons why chinoiserie gained such popularity in Europe in the 18th century.  Europeans had a fascination with the exotic East due to their increased, but still restricted, access to new cultures through expanded trade with East Asia, especially China. The limited number of European first-hand experiences of East Asia and their restricted circulation created a level of mystification and misinformation that contributed to the mystification of East Asian cultures.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} The 'China' indicated in the term 'Chinoiserie' represented in European people's mind a wider region of the globe that could embrace China itself, but also Japan, Korea, South-East Asia, India or even Persia. In art, the style of the Orient was considered a source of inspiration; the atmosphere rich in images and the harmonic designs of the oriental style reflected the picture of an ideal world, from which to draw ideas in order to reshape one own's culture. For this reason the style of Chinoiserie is to be regarded as an important result of the exchange between the West and the East. During the 19th century, and especially in its latter period, the style of Chinoiserie was assimilated under the generic definition of [[exoticism]].&lt;ref name="Deguo Wolizi 2015, pp. 37-44"&gt;張省卿 ([[Sheng-Ching Chang]])，《東方啓蒙西方 – 十八世紀德國沃里兹（Wörlitz）自然風景園林之中國元素(Dongfang qimeng Xifang- shiba shiji Deguo Wolizi (Wörlitz) ziran fengjing yuanlin zhi Zhongguo yuansu) 》 (The East enlightening the West – Chinese elements in the 18th century landscape gardens of Wörlitz in Germany), 台北 (Taipei)：輔仁大學出版社(Furendaxue chubanshe; Fu Jen University Bookstore), 2015, pp. 37–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the root of the word 'Chinoiserie' is 'Chine' (China), the Europeans of the 17th and 18th centuries didn't have a clear conceptualization of how China was in reality. Often terms like 'Orient', 'Far East' or 'China' were all equally used to signify the region of Eastern Asia that had proper Chinese culture as a major representative, but the meaning of the term could change according to different contexts. Sir William Chambers for example, in his oeuvre A Dissertation on Oriental Gardening of 1772, generically addresses China as the 'Orient'.&lt;ref name="Deguo Wolizi 2015, pp. 37-44"/&gt;  In the financial records of Louis XIV during the 17th and 18th centuries were already registered expressions like 'façon de la Chine', Chinese manner, or 'à la chinoise', made in the Chinese way. In the 19th century the term 'Chinoiserie' appeared for the first time in French literature. In the novel ''[https://fr.wikipedia.ord/wiki/L'Interdiction L'Interdiction]'' published in 1836, Honoré de Balzac used Chinoiserie to refer to the craftworks made in the Chinese style. From this moment on the term gained momentum and started being used more frequently to mean objects produced in the Chinese style but sometimes also to indicate graceful objects of small dimension or of scarce account. In 1878 'Chinoiserie' entered formally in the [[:fr:Dictionnaire de l'Académie française|Dictionnaire de l'Académie]].&lt;ref name="Deguo Wolizi 2015, pp. 37-44"/&gt;

After the spread of [[Marco Polo|Marco Polo's narrations]], the knowledge of China held by the Europeans continued to derive essentially from reports made by merchants and diplomatic envoys. Dating from the latter half of the 17th century a relevant role in this exchange of information was then taken up by the Jesuits, whose continual gathering of missionary intelligence and language transcription gave the European public a new deeper insight of the Chinese empire and its culture.&lt;ref&gt;張省卿 ([[Sheng-Ching Chang]])，《東方啓蒙西方 – 十八世紀德國沃里兹（Wörlitz）自然風景園林之中國元素(Dongfang qimeng Xifang- shiba shiji Deguo Wolizi (Wörlitz) ziran fengjing yuanlin zhi Zhongguo yuansu) 》 (The East enlightening the West – Chinese elements in the 18th century landscape gardens of Wörlitz in Germany), 台北 (Taipei)：輔仁大學出版社(Furendaxue chubanshe; Fu Jen University Bookstore), 2015, pp. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Europeans frequently held inaccurate ideas about East Asia, this did not necessarily preclude their fascination and respect.  In particular, the Chinese who had "exquisitely finished art... [and] whose court ceremonial was even more elaborate than that of Versailles" were viewed as highly civilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Chinoiserie|last = Mayor|first = A. Hyatt|date = 1941|journal = The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Voltaire]] in his ''Art de la Chine'', "The fact remains that four thousand years ago, when we did not know how to read, they [the Chinese] knew everything essentially useful of which we boast today."&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire ''as qtd. in'' Lovejoy, Arthur. (1948) ''Essays in the History of Ideas'' (1948). Johns Hopkins U. Press. 1978 edition: {{ISBN|0-313-20504-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, somewhere, on the other side of the world, there existed a culture so rich that it rivaled the civilizations of Rome and Greece. Chinoiserie created a juxtaposition between something new and exotic for Europeans while at the same time reflecting the values of the 4,000 year old culture from which these objects came.

Chinoiserie was not universally popular. Some critics saw the style as "…a retreat from reason and taste and a descent into a morally ambiguous world based on hedonism, sensation and values perceived to be feminine."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was viewed as lacking the logic and reason upon which Antique art had been founded. Architect and author [[Robert Morris (writer)|Robert Morris]] claimed that it "…consisted of mere whims and chimera, without rules or order, it requires no fertility of genius to put into execution."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Those with a more archaeological view of the East, considered the chinoiserie style, with its distortions and whimsical approach, to be a mockery of the actual Chinese art and architecture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Finally, still others believed that an interest in chinoiserie indicated a pervading "cultural confusion" in European society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Interracial Encounters: Reciprocal Representations in African and Asian American Literatures, 1896–1937|last = Lee|first = Julia H.|publisher = NYU Press|year = 2011|isbn = 0-8147-5257-8|location = New York|pages = 114–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persistence after the 18th century ==
[[File:Rex Whistler - Wallpaper in the Chinoiserie Style, with a Picture Frame as its Central Motif 1932.jpg|thumb|Wallpaper in the chinoiserie style, with a picture frame as its central motif, [[Rex Whistler]]]]

Chinoiserie persisted into the 19th and 20th centuries but declined in popularity. There was a notable loss of interest in Chinese-inspired décor after the death in 1830 of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV,]] a great proponent of the style. The [[First Opium War]] of 1839–1842 between Britain and China disrupted trade and caused a further decline of interest in the Oriental.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Opium, Soldiers and Evangelicals: England's 1840–42 War with China and its Aftermath|last = Gelber|first = Harry G|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2004|isbn = 978-1-4039-0700-4|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; China closed its doors to exports and imports and for many people chinoiserie became a fashion of the past.

As British-Chinese relations stabilized towards the end of the 19th century, there was a revival of interest in chinoiserie. [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], for example, reallocated many chinoiserie works from George IV's Royal Pavilion at Brighton to the more accessible Buckingham Palace. Chinoiserie served to remind Britain of its former colonial glory that was rapidly fading with the modern era.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Chinese porcelain ==
[[File:MediciPorcelainBottle1.png|thumb|200px|right|A Medici porcelain bottle held in the [[Louvre Museum]], Paris. The Casino of San Marco's porcelain manufactory was one of the oldest successful attempts to imitate Chinese porcelain in European history.&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/372403/Medici-porcelain |title=Medici porcelain |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2013-07-22 |accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

From the [[Renaissance]] to the 18th century Western designers attempted to imitate the technical sophistication of [[Chinese export porcelain]] (and for that matter [[Japanese export porcelain]] - Europeans were generally vague as the origin of "oriental" imports), with only partial success. One of the earliest successful attempts, for instance, was the [[Medici porcelain]] manufactured in Florence during the late-16th century, as the Casino of San Marco remained open from 1575–1587.&lt;ref name="britannica1" /&gt; Despite never being commercial in nature, the next major attempt to replicate Chinese porcelain was the [[soft-paste porcelain|soft-paste]] manufactory at [[Rouen manufactory|Rouen]] in 1673, with Edme Poterat, widely reputed as creator of the French soft-paste pottery tradition, opening his own factory in 1647.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Editors |first=The |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/510765/Rouen-ware |title=Rouen ware &amp;#124; pottery |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were eventually made to imitate [[hard-paste porcelain]], which were held in high regard. As such, the direct imitation of Chinese designs in [[faience]] began in the late 17th century, was carried into European porcelain production, most naturally in tea wares, and peaked in the wave of rococo chinoiserie (c. 1740–1770).{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Earliest hints of chinoiserie appear in the early 17th century, in the arts of the nations with active East India Companies, [[Dutch East India Company|Holland]] and [[British East India Company|England]], then by the mid-17th century, in Portugal as well. [[Tin-glazed pottery]] (see ''[[delftware]]'') made at [[Delft]] and other Dutch towns adopted genuine blue-and-white [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] decoration from the early 17th century. After a book by [[Johan Nieuhof]] was published the 150 pictures encouraged chinoiserie, and became especially popular in the 18th century. Early ceramic wares in [[Meissen porcelain]] and other factories naturally imitated Chinese designs, though the shapes for "useful wares", table and tea wares, typically remained Western, often based on shapes in silver.  Decorative wares such as vases followed  Chinese shapes.

== Painting ==
The ideas of the decorative and pictorial arts of the East permeated the European and American arts and craft scene. For example, in the United States, "by the mid-18th century, Charleston had imported an impressive array of Asian export luxury goods [such as]...paintings."&lt;ref&gt;Leath, R. A.. (1999). "After the Chinese Taste": Chinese Export Porcelain and Chinoiserie Design in Eighteen-Century Charleston. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25616724 Historical Archaeology]'', ''33''(3), 48–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The aspects of Chinese painting that were integrated into European and American visual arts include asymmetrical compositions, lighthearted subject matter and a general sense of capriciousness.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[William Alexander (painter)|William Alexander]] (1767–1816), a British painter, illustrator and engraver who traveled to the East Asia and China in the 18th century, was directly influenced by the culture and landscape he saw in the East.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chinoiserie: Commerce and Critical Ornament in Eighteenth-Century Britain|last = Sloboda|first = Stacey|publisher = Manchester UP|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-7190-8945-9|location = New York|pages = 29, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented an idealized, romanticized depiction of Chinese culture, but he was influenced by "pre-established visual signs."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While the Chinoiserie landscapes that Alexander depicted accurately reflected the landscape of China, "paradoxically, it is this imitation and repetition of the iconic signs of China that negate the very possibility of authenticity, and render them into stereotypes."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The depiction of China and East Asia in European and American painting was dependent on the understanding of the East by Western preconceptions, rather than representations of Eastern culture as it actually was.

== Interior design ==

Various European monarchs, such as [[Louis XV of France]], gave special favor to chinoiserie, as it blended well with the [[rococo]] style.  Entire rooms, such as those at [[Château de Chantilly]], were painted with chinoiserie compositions, and artists such as [[Antoine Watteau]] and others brought expert craftsmanship to the style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gotheborg.com/glossary/glossaryindex.htm?http://www.gotheborg.com/glossary/data/chinoiserie.shtml|title=chinoiserie|author=Jan-Erik Nilsson|publisher=Gothenborg.com|accessdate=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central European palaces like the Castle of Wörlitz or the Castle of Pillnitz all include rooms decorated with Chinese features, while in the palace of Sanssouci at Potsdam features a Dragon House (Das Drachenhaus) and the Chinese House (Das Chinesische Haus).&lt;ref&gt;張省卿 (Sheng-Ching Chang)，《東方啓蒙西方 – 十八世紀德國沃里兹（Wörlitz）自然風景園林之中國元素(Dongfang qimeng Xifang- shiba shiji Deguo Wolizi (Wörlitz) ziran fengjing yuanlin zhi Zhongguo yuansu) 》 (The East enlightening the West – Chinese elements in the 18th century landscape gardens of Wörlitz in Germany), 台北 (Taipei)：輔仁大學出版社(Furendaxue chubanshe; Fu Jen University Bookstore), 2015, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Pleasure pavilions in "Chinese taste" appeared in the formal parterres of late Baroque and Rococo German and Russian palaces, and in tile panels at [[Aranjuez]] near [[Madrid]]. [[Chinese Village]]s were built in the mountainous park of Wilhelmshöhe near Kassel, Germany; in [[Drottningholm Palace|Drottningholm]], [[Sweden]] and [[Tsarskoe Selo]], [[Russia]]. [[Thomas Chippendale]]'s mahogany tea tables and china cabinets, especially, were embellished with fretwork glazing and railings, ''c.'' 1753–70, but sober ''homages'' to early [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] scholars' furnishings were also naturalized, as the ''tang'' evolved into a mid-Georgian side table and squared slat-back armchairs suited English gentlemen as well as Chinese scholars. Not every adaptation of Chinese design principles falls within mainstream chinoiserie. Chinoiserie media included "japanned" ware imitations of lacquer and painted tin (tôle) ware that imitated [[japanning]], early painted wallpapers in sheets, after [[engraving]]s by [[Jean-Baptiste Pillement]], and ceramic figurines and table ornaments.

In the 17th and 18th centuries Europeans began to manufacture furniture that imitated Chinese lacquer furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/east-asian-lacquer-influence|title=V&amp;A · The influence of East Asian lacquer on European furniture|website=Victoria and Albert Museum|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was frequently decorated with ebony and ivory or Chinese motifs such as pagodas. [[Thomas Chippendale]] helped to popularize the production of Chinoiserie furniture with the publication of his design book ''The Gentleman and Cabinet-maker's Director: Being a large Collection of the Most Elegant and Useful Designs of Household Furniture, In the Most Fashionable Taste.'' His designs provided a guide for intricate chinoiserie furniture and its decoration. His chairs and cabinets were often decorated with scenes of colorful birds, flowers, or images of exotic imaginary places. The compositions of this decoration were often asymmetrical.

The increased use of wallpaper in European homes in the 18th century also reflects the general fascination with Chinoiserie motifs. With the rise of the villa and a growing taste for sunlit interiors, the popularity of wallpaper grew. [[John Cornforth (historian)|John Cornforth]] notes{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} that previously the "light-absorbing textures of tapestry, velvet, and damask" were preferred, but now the general interest was in light-reflecting decoration. The demand for wallpaper created by Chinese artists began first with European aristocrats between 1740 and 1790.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Wallpaper and its History|last = Entwistle|first = E. A.|date = 1961|journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Arts|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 450–456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The luxurious wallpaper available to them would have been unique, handmade, and expensive.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Later wallpaper with chinoiserie motifs became accessible to the middle class when it could be printed and thus produced in a range of grades and prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Behind Closed Doors|last = Vickery|first = Amanda|publisher = Yale UP|year = 2009|isbn = 0-300-16896-9|location = New Haven, CT|pages = 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patterns on Chinoiserie wallpaper are similar to the pagodas, floral designs, and exotic imaginary scenes found on chinoiserie furniture and porcelain. Like chinoiserie furniture and other decorative art forms, chinoiserie wallpaper was typically placed in bedrooms, closets, and other private rooms of a house. The patterns on wallpaper were expected to complement the decorative objects and furniture in a room, creating a complementary backdrop.

== Architecture and gardens ==
European understanding of Chinese and East Asian garden design is exemplified by the use of the word ''[[Sharawadgi]]'', understood as beauty, without order that takes the form of an aesthetically pleasing irregularity in landscape design. The word traveled together with imported lacquer ware from Japan where ''shara'aji'' was an idiom in appraisal of design in decorative arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Japanese Art, Aesthetics, and a European Discourse: Unraveling Sharawadgi|last = Kuitert|first = Wybe|date = 2014|journal = Japan Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 78|volume = 27}}[http://ngjs.nl/files/artikelen/2014_Unraveling_Sharawadgi_Kuitert.pdf Online as PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir William Temple]] (1628–1699), referring to such artwork, introduces the term sharawadgi in his essay ''Upon the Gardens of Epicurus'' written in 1685 and published in 1690.&lt;ref&gt;William Temple. "Upon the Gardens of Epicurus; or Of Gardening in the Year 1685." In Miscellanea, the Second Part, in Four Essays. Simpson, 1690&lt;/ref&gt; Under Temple's influence European gardeners and landscape designers used the concept of sharawadgi to create gardens that were believed to reflect the asymmetry and naturalism present in the gardens of the East.

These gardens often contain various fragrant plants, flowers and trees, decorative rocks, ponds or lake with fish, and twisting pathways. They are frequently enclosed by a wall. Architectural features placed in these gardens often include pagodas, ceremonial halls used for celebrations or holidays, pavilions with flowers and seasonal elements.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou, Ruru (2015). "Chinese Gardens". ''China Highlights''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscapes such as London's [[Kew Gardens]] show distinct Chinese influence in architecture. A monumental 163-foot pagoda in the center of the garden designed and built by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] exhibits strong English architectural elements, resulting in a product of combined cultures (Bald, 290). A replica of it was built in [[Munich]]'s [[Englischer Garten]], while the Chinese Garden of Oranienbaum include another pagoda and also a Chinese teahouse.  Though the rise of a more serious approach in [[Neoclassicism]] from the 1770s onward tended to replace Oriental inspired designs, at the height of Regency "Grecian" furnishings, the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] came down with a case of [[Brighton Pavilion]], and Chamberlain's [[Royal Worcester|Worcester china]] manufactory imitated "[[Imari porcelain|Imari]]" wares.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} While classical styles reigned in the parade rooms, upscale houses, from [[Badminton House]] (where the "Chinese Bedroom" was furnished by [[John Linnell|William and John Linnell]], ca 1754) and [[Nostell Priory]] to [[Casa Loma]] in Toronto, sometimes featured an entire guest room decorated in the chinoiserie style, complete with Chinese-styled bed, [[fenghuang|phoenix]]-themed wallpaper, and [[porcelain|china]]. Later exoticisms added imaginary Turkish themes, where a [[Divan (furniture)|"diwan"]] became a [[couch|sofa]].

== Tea ==
One of the things that contributed to the popularity of chinoiserie was the 18th-century vogue for tea drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/04/07/396664685/tea-tuesdays-how-tea-sugar-reshaped-the-british-empire|title=Tea Tuesdays: How Tea + Sugar Reshaped The British Empire|author=|date=|website=npr.org|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminine and domestic culture of drinking tea required an appropriate ''chinoiserie mise en scène''. According to Beevers, "Tea drinking was a fundamental part of polite society; much of the interest in both Chinese export wares and chinoiserie rose from the desire to create appropriate settings for the ritual of tea drinking."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After 1750, England was importing 10,000,000 pounds of tea annually, demonstrating how widespread this practice was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = English Tea Caddy|last = Fisher|first = Reka N.|date = 1979|journal = Bulletin (St. Louis Art Museum)|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 174|volume = 15.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taste for chinoiserie porcelain, both export wares and European imitations, and tea drinking was more associated with women than men. A number of aristocratic and socially important women were famous collectors of chinoiserie porcelain, among them Queen Mary, Queen Anne, Henrietta Howard, and the Duchess of Queensbury, all socially important women. This is significant because their homes served as examples of good taste and sociability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eighteenth-century_studies/v035/35.3porter.html|title = Monstrous Beauty: Eighteenth-Century Fashion and the Aesthetics of the Chinese Taste.|last = Porter|first = David L.|date = 2002|journal = American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = September 20, 2015|pages = 395–411|volume = 53.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single historical incident in which there was a "keen competition between Margaret, 2nd Duchess of Portland, and Elizabeth, Countess of Ilchester, for a Japanese blue and white plate,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Eastern Trade and the Furnishing of the British Country House|last = Impey|first = Oliver|date = 1989|journal = Studies in the History of Art|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 181|series = Symposium Papers X: The Fashioning and Functioning of the British Country House|volume = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows how wealthy female consumers asserted their purchasing power and their need to play a role in creating the prevailing vogue.

== Literary criticism ==
The term is also used in literary criticism to describe a mannered "Chinese-esque" style of writing, such as that employed by [[Ernest Bramah]] in his [[Kai Lung]] stories, [[Barry Hughart]] in his ''Master Li &amp; Number Ten Ox'' novels and [[Stephen Marley (writer)|Stephen Marley]] in his [[Chia Black Dragon]] series.&lt;ref&gt;Marley rejects the chinoiserie label in favour of his own term, "Chinese Gothic".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fashion ==
The term is also used in the [[fashion]] industry to describe "designs in textiles, fashion, and the decorative arts that derive from Chinese styles".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Fairchild Dictionary of Fashion |last=Calasibetta |first=Charlotte Mankey |author2=Tortora, Phyllis |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=[[Fairchild Publications|Fairchild Books]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-56367-973-5 |page= |url=http://fairchildpub.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/fashion-dictionary-sample1.pdf |accessdate=2011-02-17 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''coat of arms of Alabama''' depicts a shield upon which is carried the symbols of the five nations which have at various times held sovereignty over a part or the whole of what is now [[Alabama]]. These are the coat of arms of [[France]], the ancient coat of arms of [[Crown of Castile]] for [[Spain]] ([[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] quartering [[Kingdom of León|León]]), the [[Union Flag]] of the [[United Kingdom]] (which was not adopted until after Alabama's independence) and the battle flag of the [[Confederate States of America]]. On an escutcheon of pretence is borne the shield of the [[United States]]. The crest of the coat represents a ship (the "Badine") which brought the French colonists who established the first permanent European settlements in the state. Below is the [[List of U.S. state mottos|state motto]]: ''[[Audemus jura nostra defendere]]'', meaning "We dare defend our rights."

The bill to adopt a state coat of arms was introduced in the Alabama Legislature of 1939 by James Simpson, Jefferson County, and was passed without a dissenting vote by both houses.&lt;ref name="ADAH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.state.al.us |title=Alabama Department of Archives and History}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original design of the Alabamian coat of arms was made in 1923 by B.J. Tieman, New York, an authority on heraldry, at the request of Marie Bankhead Owen, Director of the Department of Archives and History.  A few years later Naomi Rabb Winston, Washington, DC, painted the completed design in oil.  Mrs. Owen selected the motto which was put into Latin by Professor W.B. Saffold, of the University of Alabama.  It was through the influence of Juliet Perry Dixon, wife of Governor Dixon, that official action was taken by the Legislature.&lt;ref name="ADAH"/&gt;

[[File:Union flag 1606 (Kings Colors).svg|thumb|left|British flag that would have flown in Alabama prior to American independence]]
The Union Flag depicted on the coat of arms, which represents the period of British rule in Alabama prior to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]], is not actually the flag used at that time. It dates to the 1801 formation of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], whereas the preceding [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] held sovereignty over Alabama prior to 1783.

==Use==
Besides being used by itself, the coat of arms is used on many governmental seals of the state, as well as the flag of the governor of Alabama.

The '''creative industry in Brazil''' refers to various economic sectors of [[Brazil]] that depend on the talents and creativity to develop.&lt;ref name="UOL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economia.uol.com.br/noticias/redacao/2013/02/07/conheca-a-economia-criativa-e-veja-5-dicas-para-empreender-na-area.htm|title=Conheça a economia criativa e veja 5 dicas para empreender na área|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Coldibeli, Larissa - UOL Economia (07/02/2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is about generating [[wealth]] for the region through [[knowledge]], [[culture]] and [[creativity]], in order to contribute to [[sustainable development]] (environmental, economic and social).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redeglobo.globo.com/globocidadania/videos/t/globo-ecologia/v/economia-criativa-cultura-e-sustentabilidade-integra/2473289/|title=Brasil possui imenso potencial no mercado da economia criativa (in ''Globo Ecologia'')|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Rede Globo de Televisão (14/07/2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '[[creative industries]]' was coined by the [[United Kingdom]] in 1990 and in 2001 won two updates: one by researcher [[John Howkins]], which gave it an entrepreneurial vision when focusing on the transformation of creativity in product;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;To do so, he based on "the [[marketing]] concepts of [[intellectual property]]" applied to [[trademarks]], [[patents]] and [[copyrights]].&lt;/ref&gt; and another one by professor [[Richard Florida]], which focused on professionals involved in the creative processes of production, addressing the social aspects and the "potential contribution to the development" of the "[[creative class]]". The first study of international coverage only emerged in 2008 - conducted by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) - the same year it was published another study on the subject, only fully about Brazil.&lt;ref name="MIC"/&gt;

== Creative professions ==

Based on the ''Classificação Brasileira de Ocupações - CBO'' (read "Brazilian Classification of Occupations"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtecbo.gov.br/cbosite/pages/pesquisas/BuscaPorTitulo.jsf|title=Classificação Brasileira de Ocupações|accessdate=16 December 2013|website=Ministério do Trabalho e Emprego}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ministry of Labour and Employment's list of all professions in the country,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;It was last updated on 2002 due to the new classification methodology, as explained on page [http://www.mtecbo.gov.br/cbosite/pages/saibaMais.jsf "CBO - Classificação Brasileira de Ocupações"].&lt;/ref&gt; the creative work market was mapped. The result of the study listed fourteen creative professions,&lt;ref name="MIC"/&gt; in which [[knowledge]] is a transforming input of production:
# [[Architecture]] and [[Engineering]]; 
# [[Art]]; 
# [[Performing arts|Performing Arts]]; 
# [[Biotechnology]]; 
# [[Design]]; 
# Cultural expressions; 
# [[Professional audiovisual industry|Film &amp; Video]]; 
# [[Publishing|Editorial Market]]; 
# [[Fashion]]; 
# [[Music]]; 
# [[Research and development]]; 
# [[Advertising]]; 
# [[Software]], [[Computer]] &amp; [[Telecommunications|Telecom]]; 
# [[Television]] &amp; [[Radio]].

== History ==

The first initiative to map the [[creative industries]] from any country was from the United Kingdom&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The document´s name is “Creative Industries Mapping Documents”, released in 1998 by the [[Department of Culture, Media and Sport]] in the UK.&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of 1990. The goal was to prove that these sectors have an important role to the [[culture]] and the potential to generate jobs and wealth to the country. Then, these creative industries were mapped, and all others who maintained relations with them as well. Thus, it was built a view of the weight of the creative chains in the production process.

Three years after this pioneering work, specifically in 2001, two others arose:

* One from researcher [[John Howkins]], who built his study according to a corporate vision (based on marketing concepts of [[intellectual property]]); 
* And another one from teacher [[Richard Florida]], which showed off the so-called "creative class" (professionals who work with creative processes).

It did not take long for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 2008) to launch another study on the subject, only this time with an international scope. According to the survey, the [[exports]] of the creative industries in the world exceeded 500 billion dollars.&lt;ref name="Unctad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/Docs/ditc20082cer_en.pdf|title=Creative Economy Report 2008: the challenge of assessing the creative economy (PDF - 2,54 MB)|accessdate=26 March 2014|date=2008|website=Unctad}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Given the importance of the issue to the world and specifically to Brazil, the study ''A Cadeia da Indústria Criativa no Brasil'' (read "The Chain of Creative Industry in Brazil"), was undertaken. It was updated in 2011 and published in 2012.&lt;ref name="MIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firjan.org.br/economiacriativa/download/Analise_completa.pdf|title=Indústria Criativa - Mapeamento da Indústria Criativa no Brasil (PDF - 1,85 MB)|accessdate=16 December 2013|website=FIRJAN, Sistema (2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tool to map the creative industry in the country is able to list information about each of these professions, such as the amount of [[job]]s, [[wages]] and the education level required. Thus, it unites information from both the ''Classificação Nacional de Atividades Econômicas'' (i.e. "National Classification of Economic Activities") and the "Brazilian Classification of Occupations".

In general, the creative industries encompass "[[economic activity]] directly related to the art world - especially the visual arts, performing arts, literature and publishing, photography, crafts, libraries, museums, galleries, archives, spots designated by the [[National Historic Landmark]] and festivals of arts (...) electronic media and other recent media (...) design-related activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economiacriativa.com/ec/pt/ec/evolucao.asp|title=A evolução do conceito de "Indústrias Criativas" no tempo|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme is sometimes confused with the term "[[culture industry]]". However, "the scope of the creative economy is determined by the extent of the creative industries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cultura.gov.br/economiacriativa/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/relatorioUNCTAD2010Port.pdf|title=Relatório de Economia Criativa 2010 (PDF)|accessdate=14 April 2014|website=Nações Unidas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, cultural products and services would be part of a larger category of creative products and services.

== Chain ==

For the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the chain of creative industry comprises the "cycles of creation, production and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] of [[goods and services]] that use creativity and [[intellectual capital]] as primary inputs."&lt;ref name="Unctad"/&gt; Thus, it can be divided into three major areas: creative core (the creative economic activities) related activities (provide goods and services directly to the core) and support (provide goods and services indirectly to the core).

The United Kingdom's [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] considers as creative industries activities "that have their origin in creativity, skill and individual talent and which have a potential for creating wealth and jobs through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property." Based on this concept, it can be said that Brazil is very important when it comes to creative industry. After all, he is one of the largest producers in the world of creativity. Analyzing the remuneration of the Brazilian people, it was found that the wages of those working in the creative industry in Brazil are almost three times higher than the national average wage (comparison value: R$4,693 and R$1,733, respectively). And among creative professionals, those from Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and the Federal District receive the best salaries. These are data from the "Creative Industries Mapping",&lt;ref name="MIC"/&gt; which was based on information from 2011. The study addresses issues such as jobs, wages, average wage per state, number of employees by segment and even from the [[GDP]] creative country.

== Acknowledgement ==

The sector has gained so much importance that, in May 2012, the Brazilian president [[Dilma Rousseff]] decreed the creation of the ''Secretaria da Economia Criativa'' ("Creative Economy Secretariat").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2011-2014/2012/Decreto/D7743.htm|title=Decreto Nº 7.743, de 31 de maio de 2012|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Presidência da República do Brasil (31/05/2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of SEC is to create, implement and monitor [[public policy]] that have the culture as a strategic axis, "prioritizing support and encouragement to professionals and to the micro and small Brazilian creative endeavors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cultura.gov.br/site/categoria/politicas/economia-criativa-2/|title=Economia Criativa|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Ministério da Cultura do Brasil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report from the [[United Nations]], Brazil is not among the top twenty producers in the industry yet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brasileconomico.epaper.grupodia.com.br/contents/BE_2011-12-05.pdf|title=Brasil avança em criatividade|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Brasil Econômico (05/12/2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the initiative of creating the SEC indicated the government's desire to reposition the "culture as development axis of the Brazilian state."&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brasileconomico.epaper.grupodia.com.br/contents/BE_2011-12-05.pdf|title=Planejando um Brasil criativo|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Brasil Econômico (05/12/2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the President of the [[National Bank for Economic and Social Development]] (BNDES), [[Luciano Coutinho]], this is a recognition that creative activities are important for the country "in a long-term perspective, having as a goal a more inclusive and sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cultura.gov.br/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Plano-da-Secretaria-da-Economia-Criativa.pdf|title=Economia criativa para o desenvolvimento (in ''Plano da Secretaria da Economia Criativa'')|website=Ministério da Cultura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, the countries that have excelled in the industry are [[China]], in the first place, followed by the [[United States]] and [[Germany]]. But Brazil has contributed greatly in the fields of architecture, fashion and design, revealing its creative potential worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globotv.globo.com/rede-globo/globo-ecologia/v/brasil-possui-imenso-potencial-no-mercado-da-economia-criativa/2473267/|title=Economia criativa:cultura e sustentabilidade (in ''Globo Ecologia'')|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Rede Globo de Televisão (14/07/2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brazilian x-ray ==

The creative industry in Brazil gathers, generally, "young, educated and well-paid professionals" that earn 42% above the average wage in the country.&lt;ref name="UOL"/&gt; It is difficult to know how much an idea or innovation costs, once they are [[intangible assets]]. One way of finding that out would be to create metrics and to use qualitative and quantitative researches. What is possible to identify are general economic data related to the Creative Industry in Brazil, such as:&lt;ref name="MIC"/&gt;

* '''''Share of GDP''''': R$110 billion
* '''''Enterprises''''': 243 thousand
* '''''Professionals''''': 810 thousand, of which the most numerous are:
# [[Architects]] and [[engineer]]s: 229 877 [[employee]]s formal; 
# [[Programmer]]s information systems: 50,440; 
# [[Business analyst]]s: 45,324; 
# Research and market analyst: 25,141; 
# [[Marketing manager]]: 20,382; 
# [[Advertising agents]]: 14,032; 
# [[Graphic Designer]]: 17,806; 
# [[Biologist]]: 15,182; 
# Manager of research and development: 13,414; 
# Designer of bespoke shoes: 13,068. 
*'''''Wages''''': the best paid creative activities are: 
# [[Geologists]] and [[geophysical]]s: R$11,385; 
# Directors of [[TV shows]]: R$10,753; 
# [[Actor]]s: R$10,348; 
# [[Biotechnologist]]s: R$8,701; 
# News room directors: R$7,774; 
# [[Magazine]] editors: R$7,594; 
# [[Architect]]s and [[engineer]]s: R$7,524; 
# [[Electrical Engineer]]s, [[electronics engineer]]s and [[Computer engineer]]s: R$7,431; 
# [[Screenwriter]]s: R$7,347; 
# [[Researcher]]s in general: R$7,102.
According to the Creative Economy Secretary of the [[Ministry of Culture (Brazil)|Ministry of Culture]], Cláudia Leitão, the country is learning to grow in this area, transforming the "Brazilian creativity into innovation and innovation into wealth."&lt;ref name="SEC"/&gt;

{{confused|Dan Parks}}
'''Dan Park''' (born May 4, 1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Birth data from Ratsit.se | url = http://www.ratsit.se/19680504-Dan_Fredrik_Park_Limhamn/ph-02o_-HdApJMgEYq_agD6UsZabOtLv6Y4ZEYM2q8M}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Swedish [[street artist]] who has been arrested, fined, and sentenced to jail for [[Hate speech#Sweden|hate speech]] in Swedish Courts several times for his art.

In 2011, Park was arrested for a collage poster depicting an Afro-Swede &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Swedish artist jailed for 'race hate'  | url = http://www.thelocal.se/20140821/swedish-artist-jailed-for-race-hate-pictures | work=[[The Local]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; student activist naked and in chains along with text saying "Our negro slave has run away", and the activist's personal contact information. Park singled out the student activist for reporting a student party with people in blackface. Park was convicted of defamation and racial agitation, and given a suspended sentence, fined, and ordered to pay damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Artist avoids jail for 'negro slave taunt' | url = http://www.thelocal.se/20120127/38756 | work=[[The Local]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Park was arrested at the opening of an exhibition of his collage posters, and was sentenced to 6 months in jail for incitement to racial agitation and defamation, and ordered to pay a total of 60,000 kronor ($8,700) in damages to four people depicted in his pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20140821/swedish-artist-jailed-for-race-hate-pictures |title=Swedish artist jailed for 'race hate' pictures |work=[[The Local]] |date=2014-08-21 |accessdate=2014-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the court ordered 9 of his works destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sentenced: Swedish Artist Dan Park "Incited Against an Ethnic Group" | url = http://hyperallergic.com/154676/sentenced-swedish-artist-dan-park-incited-against-an-ethnic-group/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park himself insists that his works are not racist, but a satiric commentary on current events and against [[political correctness]] in Sweden. Park is mainly notable for the intense public debate about [[freedom of speech]] that his case and works have generated, especially in Denmark, where his works have been exhibited in the Parliament building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dan Parks forbudte billeder vises på Christiansborg i dag | publisher=Politiken | url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/kunst/ECE2432649/dan-parks-forbudte-billeder-vises-paa-christiansborg-i-dag/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7028">[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic and most popular graphic design tools.]]

'''Design tools''' are objects, media, or computer programs, which can be used to [[design]]. They may influence the process of production, expression and perception of design ideas&lt;ref&gt;Jane Anderson: ''Architectural Design'', Basics Architecture 03, Lausanne, AVA academia, 2011, {{ISBN|978-2-940411-26-9}}, p. 40 &lt;/ref&gt; and therefore need to be applied skillfully.&lt;ref&gt;Christof Ehrlich: The Construction of the Idea and its Tools, in: Design - Creativity and Materialization. Cottbus, 1999, ISSN 1434-0984.&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Objects==
New ideas can come by way of experimenting with tools and methods. Some designers explore ideas using pencil and paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws &amp; Lectures]. retrieved 31-01-2011&lt;/ref&gt; Others use many different mark-making tools and resources from computers to sculpture as a means of inspiring creativity. Traditionally, objects like pencil, compass, ruler, drawing triangle have been considered design tools and have been used to characterize design and designers.&lt;ref&gt;Elke Krasny: The Making of Architecture, Graz, 2011, at: http://www.elkekrasny.at/en/archives/tag/architektur-beginnt-im-kopf-the-making-of-architecture &lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the success of traditional design tools such as pencil and paper is that these tools can be used without any special knowledge and their usage facilitates a continuous flow of thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;PETRUSCHAT, Jörg (2001): Bemerkungen zum Zeichnen, in: form+zweck, Heft 18, pp. 70 – 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
The appropriate development and presentation tools can substantially change how an audience perceives a project. The [[medium (communication)|media]] used for design can be divided in two categories, visual and verbal. Conventionally, in areas like [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], or [[graphic design]], visual media are considered more important than verbal media. In other areas like [[engineering]], the use of verbal design media may be prevalent. 

===Visual===
Visual design tools are, for example, gesture, sketch, drawing, scale model, perspective drawing, photograph, film, video. [[Eugene S. Ferguson]]'s 1977 paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', entitled "The mind's eye: Nonverbal thought in technology", is credited for clarifying the role of [[visual reasoning]] in the thinking process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard S. Becker]] ''Telling About Society.'' 2007. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In this article he reasoned that "Thinking with pictures is an essential strand in the intellectual history of technological development."&lt;ref name="ESF 1977"&gt;Ferguson, Eugene S. "[http://cgt101.tech.purdue.edu/info/art01_Ferguson_1977.pdf The mind's eye: Nonverbal thought in technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318155344/http://cgt101.tech.purdue.edu/info/art01_Ferguson_1977.pdf |date=2014-03-18 }}." ''Science'' 197.4306 (1977): 827&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes his article with the following statement:
:''Much of the creative thought of the designers of our technological world is nonverbal, not easily reducible to words; its language is an object or a picture or a visual image in the mind. It is out of this kind of thinking that the clock, printing press, and snowmobile have arisen. Technologists, converting their nonverbal knowledge into objects directly (as when an artisan fashioned an American ax) or into drawings that have enabled others to build what was in their minds, have chosen the shape and many of the qualities of our man-made surroundings. This intellectual component of technology, which is non-literary and non-scientific, has been generally unnoticed because its origins lie in art and not in science.&lt;br&gt;As the scientific component of knowledge in technology has increased markedly in the 19th and 20th centuries, the tendency has been to lose sight of the crucial part played by nonverbal knowledge in making the "big" decisions of form, arrangement, and texture, that determine the parameters within which a system will operate.''&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Eugene S.

In his work claims Ferguson that visual reasoning is a widely used tool used in creating technological artefacts. There is ample evidence that visual methods, particularly drawing, play a central role in creating artefacts.

===Verbal===
Verbal design tools are, for example, metaphor, description, discussion, critique, theory, algorithm, calculation, program. 

==Computer programs==
[[Computer]] programs have many functions which can be discussed in terms of design tools. One of the most widely used design tools is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software like [[Autodesk Inventor]], DSS [[SolidWorks]], or [[Pro Engineer]] which enables designers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[Digital Mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows designers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.

There is some debate whether computers enhance the creative process of design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com], topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid production from the computer allows many designers to explore multiple ideas quickly with more detail than what could be achieved by traditional hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]] on paper, moving the designer through the creative process more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; However, being faced with limitless choices does not help isolate the best design solution and can lead to endless iterations with no clear design outcome. A designer may use [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]] to explore multiple or complex ideas quickly&lt;ref&gt;Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] Retrieved 3-19-2008&lt;/ref&gt; without the distractions and complications of software.

'''''Earth from the Air''''' is a popular collection of environmental [[photograph]]s taken from the air by [[Yann Arthus-Bertrand]]. They have been published in a number of books together with text describing environmental concerns related to the photographs.

Large format versions of many of the photographs have also been exhibited in various cities. In [[London]] they were on display outside the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]; and were subsequently exhibited outside [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]] for most of 2005, together with a giant [[world]] [[map]] on the ground showing where each photograph was taken.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12189">'''Fooding''' is a brand of a restaurant guide and gastronomic events that was founded in 2000. A [[portmanteau|contraction]] of the words "food" and "feeling", the Fooding aims (in the words of [[Frédéric Mitterrand]]) to “defend a less-intimidating gastronomy for those who want to cook and nourish themselves in an unstuffy fashion”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/styles/saveurs/restaurant/le-fooding-fete-ses-10-ans-et-ses-chefs_937012.html|title=Le Fooding fête ses 10 ans et ses chefs|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[neologism]] appeared for the first time in 1999 in a Nova Mag article by French journalist and food critic, Alexandre Cammas. It has since become the brand of an annual restaurant guide (in print, online, and smartphone application) and of often charitable international culinary events.

==The concept==

According to [[Adam Gopnik]] in his ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' piece, the Fooding is to cuisine what the French New Wave was to French Cinema. The hidden goal was to Americanize French food without becoming American, just as the New Wave, back in the fifties and sixties, was about taking in Hollywood virtues without being Hollywoodized—taking in some of the energy and optimism and informality that the French still associate with American movies while reimagining them as something distinctly French".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/04/05/100405fa_fact_gopnik?currentPage=4|title=No Rules!|date=5 April 2010|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fooding's mission across its editorial activities and events is to liberate cuisine from the traditional codes and conventions that confine it, to give chefs the possibility of expressing themselves more fully, and to give contemporary eaters a true taste of the times. Through opening this “freer channel in the gastronomic universe”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lhotellerie-restauration.fr/journal/restauration/2010-11/Le-Fooding-celebre-ses-10-ans.htm|title=Abonnement à L'Hôtellerie Restauration|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fooding emphasizes “the appetite for novelty and quality, rejection of boredom, love of fun, the ordinary, the sincere, and a yearning to eat with the times”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RX37xIhpNBUC&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Mangeur hypermoderne (Le)|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially established by Cammas along with fellow journalist and food critic Emmanuel Rubin, the Fooding was supported by [[Jean-François Bizot]] (founder of [[Actuel]] and [[Radio Nova (France)|Radio Nova]]), as well as by Bruno Delport, the director of Novapress. Since 2004, it has been under the support of Marine Bidaud, associate director of the Fooding.

==The guide==

As an independent food guide, Fooding pays the bills for its reviewers, proving this by posting meal receipts on its website. It also refuses to give ad space to the restaurants it reviews in an attempt to remain financially separate. These are the essential conditions, says Cammas, for preserving freedom of expression and taste. In 2012, Cammas published an opinion piece in ''[[Le Monde]]'', discussing the above conditions and defending the [[Michelin Guide]]’s ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2012/03/05/le-guide-michelin-doit-se-liberer-de-l-influence-des-grands-chefs_1651980_3232.html Le Monde, 05/03/2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though written entirely in French, the ''Tips in English'' allow Anglophones to follow the guide as well. The 2013 Fooding Guide, launched this November, now includes a section on favorite restaurants around the world.

==The paper guide==

The first editions of the Fooding guide (2000–2004) were released as special editions of [[Nova Magazine]]: ''Guide Fooding : 1000 adresses pour saliver Paris'' (''The Fooding Guide: 1000 restaurants to drool over in Paris''). In 2003 and 2004, two ''Fooding &amp; Style'' special issues were published as a supplement to Nova Magazine. In 2004, Nova Magazine stopped publication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/culture/20041207.OBS3123/nova-mag-c-est-fini.html|title=Nova Mag , c'est fini|date=7 December 2004|work=nouvelobs.com|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a result, its special editions. In November 2005, the Paris Fooding Guide relaunched as a supplement to ''[[Libération]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/hors-serie/0101548670-fooding-le-guide-2006|title=Fooding Le guide 2006|work=liberation.fr|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of Louis Dreyfus. In December 2005, the website launched with the online edition of the Paris Guide. The France Fooding Guide was published for the first time in 2006, again in partnership with ''[[Libération]]''. As such, lefooding.com became a national guide.
In 2006 and 2007, the Fooding Guide followed Louis Dreyfus to the [[Nouvel Observateur]],&lt;ref name="e-marketing"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.e-marketing.fr/Breves/Le-guide-Fooding-rejoint-MediaObs-20727.htm |title=Le guide Fooding rejoint MediaObs (Fooding guide meets MediaObs)|journal=Vision Marketing|date=27 March 2007|publisher=e-marketing.fr|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he took up the post of general director. The 2008 France Guide then became a special edition of the Novel Observateur during summer 2007 with the subtitle ''370 restaurants bien de chez nous – Guide vacances été 2007'' (''370 of our restaurants – Summer vacation guide 2007''). The 2008 Paris Guide came out in September 2007 with the subtitle ''400 restaurants pour embrasser le goût de l’époque'' (''400 restaurants that embrace the taste of the times''). In 2008, a few months after the death of Jean-François Bizot, the Fooding office moved in with the Inrockuptibles at the invitation of Frédéric Allary. In November 2008, for the first time in its history, the France Fooding Guide was published autonomously, under the exclusive direction of Alexandre Cammas and Marine Bidaud.

==Le Fooding App==

Launched at the end of October 2010, Le Fooding’s iPhone app was originally available for free until December 31, 2010. The application was downloaded 80,000 times in two months. Since January 1, 2011, the France Guide iPhone app has been available as a paid application (€3.59). It was described in GQ as “the application reserved for gentlemen”. In January 2013, the app was ranked 19th overall in top paid apps and 1st in the Food and Drink category.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.applicationiphone.com/top100/payant/)&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Le Fooding Guide app for Android was released on Google Play (€3.59). In 2014, the app is available in English and in a Premium version, which also includes the hotel guide.&lt;ref&gt;(http://fwx.foodandwine.com/secrets/5-cool-hotels-france-le-fooding-s-essential-new-app)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Le Fooding Guide Writers==

Along with Alexandre Cammas (founder) and Yves Nespoulous (editor-in-chief),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefooding.com/la-tribu/ The Tribe [a list of contributors to the Le Fooding Guide&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a large group of authors, journalists, food writers, writers, “bons vivants”, bloggers and multi-talented people regularly contribute to the different editions of The Guide. These contributors include several emblematic figures of gastronomy and lifestyle, including [[:fr:Julie Andrieu|Julie Andrieu]], [[:fr:Sébastien Demorand|Sébastien Demorand]], Trish Deseine, [[:fr:Frédérick Ernestine Grasser Hermé|Frédérick Ernestine Grasser-Hermé]], Dominique Hutin, Emmanuel Rubin (cofounder of Fooding Week in 2000 and former partner in Le Fooding Bureau)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.fr/Elle-a-Table/Les-dossiers-de-la-redaction/Dossier-Elle/Fooding-people-22191/EMMANUEL-RUBIN-22208|title=EMMANUEL RUBIN|work=elle.fr|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://www.slate.fr/source/27089/andrea-petrini Andrea Petrini]. François-Régis Gaudry (journalist at L’Express, France Inter and Paris Première) said on his blog that he bylined his first gastronomy article for Le Fooding Guide in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lexpress.fr/styles/restaurant/about/ L'Express [About François-Régis Gaudry&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Many other collaborators made their debut as professional food lovers with Le Fooding Guide: Marie Aline, [http://www.lexpress.fr/styles/saveurs/restaurant/keda-black-globe-croqueuse_473928.html Kéda Black], Danièle Gerkens, Jérome Lefort, [http://www.dailyneuvieme.com/Francois-Lemarie-la-fine-bouche-du-9e_a2258.html Francois Lemarie], Elvira Masson, Julia Sammut (former associate at Le Fooding Bureau), [[Victoire Loup]] and Hugo de St Phalle.

==Controversies==
Even though most foreign observers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/04/05/100405fa_fact_gopnik|title=No Rules!|date=5 April 2010|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that Le Fooding contributes to the reinvention of the French culinary and event scene on an international scale, this is not always the case in France. Jean-Luc Petitrenaud in VSD wrote that Le Fooding is “a ridiculous trend for a few Parisian journalists looking for fame” (VSD, Winter 2004). Supporters of more traditional cuisine count several French journalistic institutions among Le Fooding’s main detractors. A now-famous debate between the journalist Paul Wermus (anti-Fooding) and Alexandre Cammas during Paul Amar’s TV program, Revu et Corrigé, is regularly featured in TV blooper shows.&lt;ref name="france5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videos.france5.fr/video/iLyROoafYlj6.html|title=Les Vidéos &amp;#124; Revoir les emissions en videos et streaming &amp;#124; France 5|publisher=videos.france5.fr|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2010, during the 10-year anniversary celebration of Le Fooding, then-current French Culture Minister Frédéric Mitterrand surprised the world of gastronomy by presenting Le Fooding Award to a Brittany chef. A couple of days later, journalists Colette Monsat and François Simon questioned him in the November 19, 2010 issue of le Figaro, saying “You preach the values of traditional (French) cuisine but at the same time are an avid supporter of Le Fooding, which you praised this week for its playful, less formal approach to gastronomy.” The Minister responded, “You can love Rembrandt and Basquiat. By appreciating Basquiat, one comes to have a taste for Rembrandt, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madame.lefigaro.fr/art-de-vivre/jaime-pot-feu-bouchees-reine-191110-23251|title= J’aime le pot-au-feu et les bouchées à la reine |author=Colette Monsat et François Simon|date=19 November 2010|work=Madame Figaro|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

'''''Fragments of a Cope with the Seven Sacraments''''' refers to a 15th-century [[cope]] in the collection of the [[Historical Museum of Bern]]. It is part of the [[church treasure]] from the [[Lausanne Cathedral | Cathedral of Lausanne]] sent to [[Bern]] after the Protestant conquest of [[Canton Vaud]] in 1536. The cope can be attributed to a master from the Netherlands in the circle of [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and was probably executed in [[Tournai]] where van der Weyden had a workshop from 1432 onwards.

== Description ==
[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (239)pano-new.jpg|thumb|left| Mantle of the Vestments of the Order of the Golden Fleece, [http://www.kaiserliche-schatzkammer.at/en/visit/collections/secular-treasury/selected-masterpieces/ Imperial Treasury, Vienna]]]
[[File:Mantle of the the Vestments of the Order of the Golden Fleece, detail - Imperial Treasury, Vienna KK 21.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the Mantle of the Vestments of the Order of the Golden Fleece.]]

The piece pictured is the hood. It depicts the [[Eucharist]] in the new tradition of the ''[[Devotio Moderna]]'' that arose in the [[Netherlands]] in the fifteenth century. The embroidery uses one of the most expensive of the Tournai embroiders' techniques, the ''[[Goldwork (embroidery) | or nué]] (shaded gold)'' technique in which the juxtaposed gold threads are more or less closely covered by silk threads. A famous example of this kind of work is the ''[[Mantle of the Vestments of the Order of the Golden Fleece]]'' dating from around 1425–1450 and now at the [[Imperial Treasury (Vienna) | Imperial Treasury]], [[Vienna]].

The cope was commissioned by [[Jacques of Savoy, Count of Romont]] and presented by him to the [[Bishop of Lausanne]]. The Coat of Arms of the Counts of Savoy is embroidered at the bottom and show that the work was made before 1478, the year Jacques of Savoy was admitted to the Order of the Golden Fleece, as it lacks the [[Order of the Golden Fleece | Collar of the Golden Fleece]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell &amp; Van der Stock, pp.536-40&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3063">'''Konger''' is a Polish [[performance art]] group from [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], established in 1983 by a group of professional artists &lt;ref&gt;''Polifonia głosów - KONGER (The polyphony of voices - KONGER)'', Fort Sztuki 1:2004, p. 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt; in protest against the imposition of [[Martial law in Poland]]. The artists boycotted all state galleries and took up [[performance art]] instead, an obsolete medium in the eyes of the official art critics. 

The Group was founded by [[Wladyslaw Kazmierczak]], Artur Tajber, Marian Figiel and Marcin Krzyżanowski. Others included Kazimierz Madej and [[Peter Grzybowski]]. The activity was documented by Barbara Maroń. 

The artists performed individual art actions at a time when Polish [[performance art]] was experiencing political repressions. The performance in Zakład nad Fosą was transmitted live through video equipment and monitors outside the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;''Polifonia głosów - KONGER (The polyphony of voices - KONGER)'', Fort Sztuki 1:2004, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;      

The performances of Konger Group triggered strong criticism from the Polish authorities and resulted in a ban on performing in public for Artur Tajber,{{citation needed|date=June 2007}} issued by the local committee of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]].

'''''L'Arlésienne''''', '''''L'Arlésienne: Madame Ginoux''''', or '''''Portrait of Madame Ginoux''''' is the title given to a group of six similar [[painting]]s by [[Vincent van Gogh]], painted in [[Arles]], November 1888 (or later), and in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]], February 1890.  '''L'Arlésienne''' is pronounced 'lar lay zyen'; it means literally "the woman from Arles".

The subject, ''Marie Jullian'' (or ''Julien''), was born in [[Arles]] June 8, 1848 and died there August 2, 1911.  She married ''Joseph-Michel Ginoux'' in 1866 and together they ran the ''Café de la Gare'', 30 Place Lamartine, where van Gogh lodged from May to mid-September 1888.  He had the [[Yellow House (painting)|Yellow House]] in Arles furnished to settle there.

Evidently until this time, van Gogh's relations to M. and Mme. Ginoux had remained more or less commercial (the café is the subject of ''[[The Night Café]]''), but [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]]'s arrival in Arles altered the situation.  His courtship charmed the lady, then about 40 years of age, and in the first few days of November 1888 Madame Ginoux agreed to have a portrait session for Gauguin, and his friend van Gogh.  Within an hour, Gauguin produced a charcoal drawing while Vincent produced a full-scale painting, "knocked off in ''one'' hour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Theo van Gogh. Arles, on or about Saturday, 3 November 1888|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let717/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=''[[Van Gogh Museum|Vincent van Gogh Museum]]''|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==November 1888 version and its ''repetition''==

Van Gogh's first version, now in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris, is painted on [[Hessian (cloth)|burlap]].  A complete ''piece'' of this fabric was acquired by Gauguin just after his arrival in Arles, and used by both artists in November and December 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Letter; see Druick &amp; Seghers&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:LArlesienneWithBooks.jpg|''L'Arlésienne'': Madame Ginoux with books. Oil on canvas, 91.5 x 73.7&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York
&lt;/gallery&gt;

For the second version, now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]], van Gogh again painted on the commercially pre-primed canvas he had previously used, and he replaced the gloves and umbrella with some books.

==February 1890 versions==

While in the asylum at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]], van Gogh painted another five portraits of Madame Ginoux, based on Gauguin's charcoal drawing of November 1888. Of these, one was intended for Gauguin, one for his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], one for himself and one for Madame Ginoux. The provenance of the version in the [[Kröller-Müller Museum]] is not known in detail, but the painting is known to have been previously owned by [[Albert Aurier]], an early champion of Vincent's paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Aurier, G. Albert. "[http://www.vggallery.com/misc/archives/aurier.htm The Isolated Ones: Vincent van Gogh]", January, 1890. Reproduced on vggallery.com. Retrieved 25 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The version intended for Madame Ginoux was lost and has not been recovered. This is the version Vincent was delivering to Madame Ginoux in Arles when he suffered his relapse on February 22, 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hulsker|first=Jan|title=The Complete Van Gogh|year=1985|publisher=Crescent|isbn=0-517-44867-X|page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an unfinished letter to Gauguin that was never sent, Vincent remarked that working on her portrait cost him another month of illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Paul Gauguin, Auvers-sur-Oise, on or about Tuesday, 17 June 1890|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/RM23/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=''[[Van Gogh Museum]]''|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauguin's version was the one with a pink background, currently in the São Paulo Museum of Art. Gauguin was enthusiastic about the portrait, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I've seen the canvas of Madame Ginoux. Very fine and very curious, I like it better than my drawing. Despite your ailing state you have never worked with so much ''balance'' while conserving the sensation and the interior warmth needed for a ''work of art'', precisely in an era when art is a business regulated in advance by cold calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Gauguin to Vincent van Gogh. Paris, on or about Friday, 13 June 1890|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let884/letter.html#n-2|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=''[[Van Gogh Museum]]''|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
In a letter to his sister [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]], dated 5 June 1890, Vincent set out his philosophy for doing portraits: "I should like to do portraits which will appear as revelations to people in a hundred years' time.  In other words I am not trying to achieve this by photographic likeness but by rendering our impassioned expressions, by using our modern knowledge and appreciation of colour as a means of rendering and exalting character ... The portrait of the Arlésienne has a colourless and matt flesh tone, the eyes are calm and very simple, the clothing is black, the background pink, and she is leaning on a green table with green books. But in the copy that Theo has, the clothing is pink, the background yellowy-white, and the front of the open bodice is muslin in a white that merges into green. Among all these light colours, only the hair, the eyelashes and the eyes form black patches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pomerans|first=Arnold|title=The Letters of Vincent Van Gogh|year=1996|publisher=[[Penguin Group|The Penguin Press]]|isbn=0-14-044674-5|url=http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780140446746,00.html|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Willemien van Gogh.

==Gauguin's versions==

Gauguin produced a charcoal sketch at the original sitting of Madame Ginoux in November 1888, and later produced a canvas.

This is a list of animals that markedly feature external [[asymmetry#In organisms|asymmetry]] in some form. They are exceptions to the general pattern of [[symmetry in biology]]. In particular, these animals do not exhibit [[bilateral symmetry]] which permits streamlining and is common in animals.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;[http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/sci/A0847482.html Symmetry, biological], cited at FactMonster.com from ''[[The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia]]'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Expand list|date=April 2013}}

==Birds==
The [[crossbill]] has an unusual [[beak]] in which the upper and lower tips cross each other.&lt;ref name=nzbirds/&gt;

The [[wrybill]] is the only species of bird in the world with a beak that is bent sideways (always to the right).&lt;ref name=nzbirds&gt;[http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/wrybill.html Ngutuparore, the wrybill]. Narena Olliver, New Zealand Birds Limited. Retrieved 8 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[owl]] species, such as the [[barn owl]], have asymmetrically positioned ears that enhance sound positioning.

==Fish==

Many flatfish, such as [[flounder]]s, have eyes placed asymmetrically in the adult fish. The fish has the usual symmetrical body structure when it is young, but as it matures and moves to living close to the sea bed, the fish lies on its side, and the head twists so that both eyes are on the top.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/publications/uww-msm/articles/plaice-plie-eng.htm American Plaice], Canadian Fisheries. Retrieved 8 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fish jaw|jaws]] of the scale-eating [[cichlid]] ''[[Perissodus microlepis]]'' occur in two distinct [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] forms. One morph has its jaw twisted to the left, allowing it to eat scales more readily on its victim’s right flank. The other morph has its jaw twisted to the right, which makes it easier to eat scales on its victim’s left flank. The relative abundance of the two morphs in populations is regulated by [[frequency-dependent selection]].&lt;ref name=Lee2012&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = H.

==Mammals==
The [[narwhal]] has a [[helix|helical]] tusk on its upper left jaw.  ''[[Odobenocetops]]'', an extinct toothed whale, may have possessed similar asymmetrical dentition, though it differed from the narwhal in possessing two erupted, rear-facing tusks with the right significantly longer than the left.

The [[sperm whale]](''Physeter macrocephalus'') has a single [[nostril]] on its upper left head. The right nostril forms a phonic lip. The source of the air forced through the phonic lips is the right nasal passage. While the left nasal passage opens to the blow hole, the right nasal passage has evolved to supply air to the phonic lips. It is thought that the nostrils of the land-based ancestor of the sperm whale migrated through evolution to their current functions, the left nostril becoming the blowhole and the right nostril becoming the phonic lips.

The [[fin whale]] (''Balaenoptera physalus'') has complex and asymmetrical coloration on its head. 

[[Honey badger]]s of the subspecies ''signata'' have a second lower molar on the left side of their jaws, but not the right.&lt;ref name="r114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosevear|1974|pp=114–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reptiles==
[[File:Skull of Pareas iwasakii.jpg|thumb|right|Skull of ''Pareas iwasakii'']]
[[Iwasaki's snail-eater]] snake (''Pareas iwasakii'') is a snail-eating specialist; even newly hatched individuals feed on snails. It has asymmetric jaws, which facilitates feeding on snails with dextral (clockwise coiled) shells. A consequence of this asymmetry is that this snake is much less adept at preying on sinistral (counterclockwise coiled) snails.

==Non-avian dinosaurs==
[[Stegosaurus| ''Stegosaurus stenops'' ]] had two ''staggered'' rows of plates on its back, thus defying mirror symmetry.&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=Cameron|first=Robert P.|last2=Cameron|first2=John A.|last3=Barnett|first3=Stephen M.|date=2015-08-15|title=Were there two forms of Stegosaurus? |eprint=1508.03729|class=q-bio.PE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=Cameron|first=R. P.|last2=Cameron|first2=J. A.|last3=Barnett|first3=S. M.|date=2016-11-26|title=Stegosaurus chirality |eprint=1611.08760|class=q-bio.PE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invertebrates==
[[Fiddler crab]]s and [[hermit crab]]s have one claw much larger than the other. If a male fiddler loses its large claw, it will grow another on the opposite side after [[moulting]]. A soft abdomen is also present in a hermit crab as an asymmetrical modification.

All [[gastropod]]s are asymmetrical.  This is easily seen in [[snail]]s and [[sea snail]]s, which have helical shells. At first glance [[slug]]s appear externally symmetrical, but their [[pneumostome]] (breathing hole) is always on the right side. The origin of asymmetry in gastropods is a subject of scientific debate.&lt;ref name="gastropod development"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Louise R. Page |title=Modern insights on gastropod development: Reevaluation of the evolution of a novel body plan |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |year=2006 |volume=46 |issue=2 |url=http://intl-icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/46/2/134 |pages=134–143 |doi=10.1093/icb/icj018 |pmid=21672730 |accessdate=8 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412204751/http://intl-icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/46/2/134 |archivedate=12 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other gastropods develop external asymmetry, such as ''[[Glaucus atlanticus]]'' that develops asymmetrical [[cerata]] as they mature.

''[[Histioteuthis]]'' is a genus of [[squid]], commonly known as the cock-eyed squid, because in all species the right eye is normal-sized, round, blue and sunken; whereas the left eye is at least twice the diameter of the right eye, tubular, yellow-green, faces upward, and bulges out of the head.

[[Sessility (zoology)|Sessile]] animals such as [[sponge]]s are asymmetrical.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt;

[[Coral]]s build [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] that are not symmetrical, but the individual [[polyp]]s exhibit [[radial symmetry]].

[[Alpheidae]] feature asymmetrical claws that lack pincers, the larger of which can grow on either side of the body, and if lost can develop on the opposite arm instead.

Certain [[polyopisthocotylea]]n [[monogenea]]ns are asymmetrical, as an adaptation to their attachment to the [[gill]] of their [[fish]] [[host (biology)|hosts]]. 

Certain [[parasitic]] [[copepod]]s which live inside the [[gill]] chamber of their [[fish]] [[host (biology)|hosts]] are asymmetrical.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12859">'''Max de Esteban''' is a Spanish [[art photographer]]. De Esteban holds an engineering degree from [[Universidad Politécnica de Cataluña]], a MSc from [[Stanford University]] and a PhD in economics from [[Ramon Llull University]]. He is a [[Fulbright]] Alumni. De Esteban's work is organized in two distinct bodies: ''Elegies of Manumission'' and ''Propositions.''

==''Elegies of Manumission'' and ''Propositions''==
De Esteban's work is organized in two distinct bodies: ''Elegies of [[Manumission]]'' and ''[[Propositions]].'' The four elegies produced between 2010 and 2011 raise social and political questions through symbolic [[portrait]]ure. ''Propositions,'' initiated in 2011, deal with [[contemporary art]] and political issues through [[photography]] and video. ''Propositions'' pose uncomfortable questions. In ''Proposition One,'' translucent X-ray images magnify [[mechanical device]]s that have become outdated, although they continue to function perfectly according to their purpose. In ''Proposition Three,'' de Esteban examines the cold, gray inner life of cell phones or tablets and the increasing enmeshment of the body and digital technology.

In ''Heads Will Roll,'' part four of the series, he uses seductive [[photo collage]]s made of film stills, flower photos, and fragments of text to convey the essence of the parameters that are penetrated by the postmodern patchwork of our lives. The media define everyday life: we are permanently made to feel insecure by the wars and disasters that are always happening in the world; the individual is in danger of drowning in the masses; genuine and fake have become almost indistinguishable; and a vague fear of the East pervades political policy. Reality is largely conveyed as a media experience. ''Heads will Roll'' was listed as a [[photobook]] of the year by [[LensCulture]] magazine;&lt;ref name="lensculture1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lensculture.com/articles/lensculture-editors-2014-photobooks-of-the-year |title=2014 Photobooks of the Year - Photobooks selected by the editors |publisher=LensCulture |date= |accessdate=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; its New York exhibition was shown on the cover of ''Photograph Magazine'' in its September–October, 2015 issue (Volume 13, Number 1);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rexer |first=Lyle |url=http://photographmag.com/issues/september-october-2015/about-the-cover/ |title=» September – October 2015 |website=Photographmag.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Artslant said it was a "must see exhibitions in North America"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Artslant |first=The |url=https://www.artslant.com/la/articles/show/43886 |title=North America's Must-See Exhibitions This Fall |publisher=ArtSlant |date= |accessdate=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Microsymphony''''' is a single-movement composition for [[orchestra]] by the American composer [[Charles Wuorinen]].  The work was commissioned by the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] and was completed in 1992.&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;[[Charles Wuorinen|Wuorinen, Charles]] (1992). [http://www.charleswuorinen.com/compositions/microsymphony/ Microsymphony]. Retrieved March 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  The piece was a finalist for the 1994 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Others Recommended for Pulitzers |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 13, 1994 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-13/news/mn-45543_1_los-angeles-times |accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Suzuki |first=Dean |title=View from the West: New Hope for the Pulitzer |work=[[NewMusicBox]] |date=August 1, 2003 |url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/view-from-the-west-new-hope-for-the-pulitzer/ |accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The ''Microsymphony'' has a duration of roughly 11 minutes and is composed in one continuous [[Movement (music)|movement]].  The seemingly contradictory title refers to the composition's relatively brief length, which is uncommon for a traditional [[symphony]].

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra comprising four [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (4th doubling [[piccolo]]), three [[oboe]]s, three [[clarinet]]s (3rd doubling [[bass clarinet]]), two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s in C, two [[trombone]]s, [[bass trombone]], [[tuba]], [[timpani]], three percussionists, [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[piano]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

The '''Molinere Underwater Sculpture Park''' is a collection of [[ecological]] underwater [[contemporary]] [[art]] located in the [[Caribbean]] sea off the west coast of [[Grenada]], West Indies and was created by British [[sculptor]] [[Jason deCaires Taylor]]. In May 2006 the world's first underwater sculpture park was open for public viewing.&lt;ref name="′′Grenada′′"&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/sculptureparks/by-location/north-america/caribbean/grenada ′′Grenada′′]''Birkbeck University of London'', 19 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor′s aim was to engage local people with the underwater environment that surrounds them using his works which are derived from life casts of the local community. He installed concrete figures onto the ocean floor, mostly consisting of a range of human forms, from solitary individuals to a ring of children holding hands, facing into the oceanic currents.&lt;ref&gt;Nunes, Neil [http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2007/07/070713_gallery.shtml ′′Underwater Sculpture Park Interview′′] ''BBC Caribbean'', 13 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The Sculpture park, which began construction in 2006&lt;ref name="′′Grenada′′"/&gt; is situated on the sandy ocean floor in the barren Molinere Bay and it now acts as an aid to relieve pressure on natural reefs which have become popular among water sports enthusiasts, particularly in nearby Flamingo Bay which is the most visited snorkelling destination on the island.&lt;ref name="′′Circle Of Life′′"&gt;[http://www.divermag.com/v2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=70 ′′Circle Of Life′′]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''Diver Magazine'', January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There are over sixty-five concrete individual sculptures covering an area of over 800 square meters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/sculptureparks/by-location/north-america/caribbean/grenada ′′Grenada′′] ''Birkbeck University of London'', 19 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and in total weigh around 15 tonnes in dry cement.&lt;ref name=Underwater&gt;Krestovnikoff, Miranda,[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/3538787/Underwater-sculpture-park-off-Grenada-is-stunning-and-unique.html Article in The Telegraph] ''The Telegraph'', 1 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some debate as to the intention of the park and whether it was a dedication to the slaves that were thrown overboard during the journey through the Middle Passage from West Africa to the Americas. In response the artist says “It was never my intention to have any connection to the Middle passage. Although it was not my intention from the outset I am very encouraged how it has resonated differently within various communities and feel it is working as an art piece by questioning our identity, history and stimulating debate.”- Jason de Caires Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iamthenublack.com/2012/07/20/news-artist-jason-de-caires-taylor-clarifies-intention-of-underwater-sculptures-in-grenada-originally-thought-to-be-a-tribute-to-slavery/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture park is accessible via boat from the main port of St Georges (2 miles/3&amp;nbsp;km North of the capital) or Grand Anse Bay on the West coastline. The sculptures are situated in a variety of depths of water with a maximum of 12 meters,  and the park is visited daily by [[scuba diving|scuba]] divers, [[snorkelers]] and glass bottom boats.&lt;ref name="′′Circle Of Life′′"/&gt; Recently a local artist on the island has added new works to the sculpture park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcamgrenada.com/news-specials/32-grenada-news-a-specials/190-new-sculpture-unveiled-for-the-underwater-sculpture-park online article in ′′The Grenada Webcam′′]''Grenada Webcam'', 1 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Symposium Magazine'' p. 36, February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable sculptures ==
''Grace Reef'' was installed in 2006 at a depth of 12 feet. The first installation in the hurricane damaged bay of Molinere and consists of 16 concrete statues cast from the body of a local Grenadian woman and positioned lying down on the sea floor.&lt;ref name=Underwater/&gt; After 14 months the figures had begun to distort with the inhabitation of life.&lt;ref name="weburbanist.com"/&gt;

''The Lost Correspondent'' was installed in 2006 at a depth of 22 feet.&lt;ref&gt;Greaves-Gabbadon, Sarah, [http://www.caribbeantravelmag.com/article/Bottom-Dwellers ′′Underwater Sculptures in Grenada′′] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022072621/http://www.caribbeantravelmag.com/article/Bottom-Dwellers# |date=22 October 2013 }} ''Caribbean Travel + Life'', November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Referenced to be a modern day Vesuvius disaster,  he is a lone concrete figure at a desk poised over a typewriter.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers,Dave ′′Wet behind the Ears′′, ''Modern Design, Architecture and Art'', p. 95, London,June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The surface of the desk is covered with a selection of newspaper articles dating back to the 1970s with many holding [[political]] significance from the [[Cuba]]n alignment before the [[revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://freeartlondon.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/underwater-sculpture/ ′′Underwater Sculpture′′] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816175633/https://freeartlondon.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/underwater-sculpture/ |date=16 August 2011 }} ''Free Art London List'', 10 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Unstill Life'', installed in 2006 at a depth of 25 feet, is a classical study of an artist's still life using simple modern day objects like a table, vase and fruit bowl.&lt;ref name="weburbanist.com"/&gt;  The static sculpture overtime has its appearance constantly changed by the course of nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eco-artware.com/newsletter/newsletter_08_09.php ′′Jason de Caires Taylor: The Underwater Sculptor′′] ''The Recycling Rag'', Summer 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vicissitudes'', installed in 2007 at a depth of 14 feet,&lt;ref name="Weburbanist 2009"&gt;[http://weburbanist.com/2009/09/09/79-unique-and-awesome-underwater-sculptures/ ′′79 Unique and Awesome Underwater Sculpture′′] ''Weburbanist'', 9 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is Taylor's most recognised work in the park: a ring of 26 standing children, holding hands and facing outwards into the current. The design took six months to make, weighed 15 tonnes in dry cement&lt;ref name=Underwater/&gt; and was constructed to withstand strong currents and tidal motion.&lt;ref name="Weburbanist 2009"/&gt; The ring symbolises the concept of life's ongoing cycle&lt;ref&gt;De Russo, David. ′′Nature Cultivates Creativity in an Underwater World′′, ''Symposium Magazine'', p. 40, February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and highlights the importance of creating a sustainable and well managed environment for future generations, holding reference to the ability of children adapt to their surroundings.&lt;ref name=Underwater/&gt; 

''The Fall From Grace,'' installed in 2007 at a depth of 21 feet, is a life size male figure riding a bicycle. After 8 months in the ocean, aquatic life was already making it a home.&lt;ref name="weburbanist.com"/&gt;

''Tam CC Project'' was installed in 2007 at a depth of 6 feet. It is a construction of 18 concrete heads fixed to a rock face in shallow water. Casts were made of students faces from T. A. Marryshow Community College, Grenada.&lt;ref name="weburbanist.com"/&gt;

==Design concepts==
[[File:MultifaithAblutionFacility.jpg|thumb|[[Ritual purification|Ablution]] facility in the [[University of Toronto]]'s multifaith building]]
The Manchester University research highlighted two key factors for a multifaith space to work:

* There needs to be a balance achieved for the range of different users most likely to make regular use of the space, thus preventing conflict. All norms and values need to be considered and respected, which often leads to an "unstable equilibrium where divergent worldviews can be brought together." Social cooperation and openness must be possible within the space.
* Most multifaith spaces maintain a very basic design, in order to minimize the visibility of a single faith group, whilst remaining easily adaptable to the many different practices for which the space may be utilized. Each space raises question of ethics and "national style", in which different faith members are able to participate in a mutually respectful, yet cooperative, manner.&lt;ref name=Manchester /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11991">'''Olivier Auber''' (born 1960) is a French independent artist and researcher. He is best known for his project "[[Poietic Generator]]" and for having introduced the concept of "Digital Perspective" in the fields of network theory, art and [[digital humanities]].

==Biography==
Olivier Auber was born in 1960 in [[Sainte-Adresse]] in [[Normandy]], [[France]]. He lives and works in Paris and Brussels.

He holds an engineering degree and a Master of Design from the [[Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts et Métiers]]. His engineering thesis focused on nonlinear optical elements (holograms) for avionics ([[head-up display]]). This initial specialization in optics has earned him early in his career as a research engineer, first in the avionics division of Thomson Csf (now [[Thales Group]]) and at [[CERN]] in Geneva.

In 1984, he takes the status of independent consulting engineer for the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] (Paris), then under construction, to work first on the development of exhibits, then quickly as project manager responsible for the design and development of several permanent and temporary exhibitions. As such, between 1984 and 1996, he designed the scenario and led the implementation of several highly technological exhibitions and media on science issues as diverse as: the sun, mathematics, electricity, symmetry in the arts and science, non-verbal human behavior, etc. In this period, he also developed some exhibition projects for other cultural institutions, such as the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], the [[Institut du Monde Arabe]], the [[Palais de la Découverte]]. The creation for the "Expressions et behaviours" exhibition inaugurated in early 1987, marked a milestone in his career, leading him from a predominantly scientific and technical culture to another more artistic and open to all components of the humanities.

End of 1987, while working with [[Tod Machover]] (MIT Medialab) and Catherine Ikam (artist) for the staging of VALIS, a contemporary music opera based on the work of [[Philip K. Dick]], he designed what would become his best known work, the "[[Poietic Generator]]", a free social artwork for all that can be played in real time over a network. In 1988, this work became the central concept of a monumental, architectural and technological project, one of the seven laureates of the international competition for the creation of the "France-Japan Monument" on [[Awaji Island]] in the Bay of [[Kobe]], launched under the aegis of [[François Mitterrand]]. This Monument never saw the daylight, but its various implementations were exhibited at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] (exhibition "Communication et Monumentalité", 1989), the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] (exhibition "Machines à communiquer", 1994) and in various galleries and art events including [http://www.arslab.it ARSLAB] in 1995, where Olivier Auber was awarded the prize "art and science" by the city of Turin, Italy. The exhibition "ARSLAB - The senses of virtuality", sponsored by the City of [[Turin]] - Promoter of Fine Arts, was organized by Ars Technica and Extramuseum and was curated by Claude Faure, Maria Grazia Mattei and Franco Torriani &lt;ref name= catalogue1&gt;1995, ''Arslab. The senses of virtual'', published by RCS Libri &amp; Grandi Opere Spa, Milan, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= catalogue2&gt;1998, ''Arslab. I labirinti del corpo in gioco.'' published by hopefulmonster, Turin, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= catalogue3&gt;1995, ''Arslab. The senses of virtuality'', published by RCS Libri &amp; Grandi Opere Spa, Milan, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 still, he was invited to the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications (now [[Télécom ParisTech]]) to develop his project, not just on the web, but on an experimental network foreshadowing the future shape of the Internet ([[Mbone]]) which allowed him to perform what is considered as the first experience of real-time collective interaction over the Internet without the intermediary of any center.

In 1996, he developed a version of [[Poietic Generator]] for the web in order to let every one access to it. Several experiments followed through electronic art festivals and academic research: Ljubljana (1998), X-00 (2000), Human-Computer Interaction Conference IHM-UTC(2002, L3D Lab, University of Colorado at Boulder in (2002), and so on.

In 1997 he co-founded the [http://km2.net/ A+H Culture Laboratory], with Bernd Hoge (architect and urban planner), Emmanuel Mâa Berriet (developer of virtual reality) and Philippe Braunstein (film producer), in order to develop interdisciplinary projects. One of the first is the creation of the [[:de:Nibelungenmuseum Worms|Nibelungen Museum]] in Worms Germany. One of the pieces in the museum, the virtual reality installation "The treasure of the Nibelungs", inspired by the [[Poietic Generator]], was also exhibited in numerous festivals, including ISEA 2000 (Paris) and Boston CyberArts 2001.

In 2002, he co-founded with Nils Aziosmanoff and Etienne Krieger the company Navidis&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navidis.com/ Navidis, innovative solutions to the Smart Cities]&lt;/ref&gt; which brings innovative solutions to the Smart City users.

In 2004, he co-founded with visual artist Yann Le Guennec the research group Anoptique that developed dataviz experiences on the Internet. In this regard were conducted several projects in partnership with the Fondation Internet Nouvelle Génération (FING), Orange Lab/France Telecom R&amp;D and INRIA, which led from 2005 on the development of many visualization tools. Anoptique commonly advised organizations such as UNESCO, the Ministry of Culture, the French Development Agency on their strategy of free software, groupware, interactive mapping and open data.

In 2010 and 2011, he contributed to the creation of a transdisciplinary Research Chair&lt;ref&gt;[http://imaginaires.telecom-paristech.fr/ Research Chair "modeling imaginary"]&lt;/ref&gt; at Telecom ParisTech devoted to "modeling imaginary" with the help of [[Dassault Systèmes]], [[Ubisoft]], Orange Lab, [[Peugeot-Citroen]], [[Alcatel Lucent]], [[BNP Paribas]], [[Datar]] and [[Minatec]].

Since 2012, Olivier Auber divides his time between consultancy, design of cultural and art projects, and research and development on the [[Poietic Generator]]. He also contributes to many working groups, as a research associate of the transdisciplinary research group "Evolution, Complexity and Cognition"&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecco.vub.ac.be/ Research group on "Evolution, Complexity and Cognition (ECCO)"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Global Brain Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalbraininstitute.org Global Brain Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Francis Heylighen]], and as an active member of the [[P2P Foundation]].

==Theoretical arguments==

From 1986, Olivier Auber theorized the [[Poietic Generator]] as an experience of two new kinds of perspectives, analogous to the spatial perspective of the Renaissance: the "temporal perspective" and the "digital perspective", on which he wrote several papers&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber : ''Du Générateur poïétique à la perspective numérique'', Revue d'esthétique 43 - 07/2003 - p. 127, oline on [http://archee.qc.ca/ar.php?page=imp&amp;no=207 Archée, Québec], "The Aestetic of the Digital Perspective", Artmedia VIII,
Paris, 2002 ([http://vv.arts.ucla.edu/publications/publications/02-03/Artmedia/PARTICIPANTSe.htm arts.ucla.edu])&lt;/ref&gt; whose terms were continued in the works of many philosophers and historians of art and science, including Anne Cauquelin,&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Anne Cauquelin|Anne Cauquelin]]: ''Fréquenter les incorporels'', PUF, collection « Lignes d'art », 2006.

'''''Pollice Verso''''' (from {{lang-la|with a turned thumb}}) is a painting by French artist [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], featuring the [[Pollice verso|eponymous Roman gesture]] directed to the winning [[gladiator]]s.

The gesture on the painting is given by the [[Vestals]] to the victorious [[murmillo]], awaiting the decision on the beaten [[retiarius]] at the [[Colosseum]]. The painting inspired the 2000 film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', where [[Commodus]] holds out a raised thumb to spare [[Maximus Decimus Meridius|Maximus]].{{Citation needed|reason=The reference below is now dead and was not from reliable source;|date=November 2018}}

==The painting==
Apart from the gladiators and Vestals, the picture shows the [[Roman emperor|emperor]] in his box. Gérôme deliberately used the light and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] to depict some features.  The blend of [[voyeurism]] and a sense of moral superiority is a specific 19th-century feature.&lt;ref name="KEJ"&gt;Eckart Köhne, Cornelia Ewigleben, Ralph Jackson. ''Gladiators and Caesars: the power of spectacle in ancient Rome'', University of California Press, 2000, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[Alexander Turney Stewart]] purchased the painting from Gérôme and exhibited it in [[New York City]]. He published a [[pamphlet]] about the work, proving to the satisfaction of his contemporaries that ''pollice verso'' was a matter of turning the thumb up or down.&lt;ref name="WCG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allartclassic.com/pictures_zoom.php?p_number=52&amp;p=&amp;number=GEJ001|title= Gerome Art Reproductions- Pollice Verso |publisher = World Classic Gallery|author= |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical accuracy===
Gérôme's depiction of Colosseum's architecture is based on accurate drawings and the armour of gladiators follows the design of those found in [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref name="KEJ"/&gt; Gérôme also checked the written sources for archaeological reference. Some Latin textbooks used ''Pollice Verso'' to illustrate Roman customs.&lt;ref name="WCG"/&gt; 

===Influence===
The producers of ''Gladiator'' showed [[Ridley Scott]] a reproduction of ''Pollice Verso'' before he read the film script. "That image spoke to me of the Roman Empire in all its glory and wickedness. I knew right then and there I was hooked", said Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingsgalleries.com/pollice-verso-thumbs-down/|title= Pollice Verso – Thumbs Down|publisher = Kings Galleries|author= |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it was found that the secutor's armour is not properly assembled.&lt;ref name="KEJ"/&gt;

'''Post-surrealism''' is a movement that arose in [[Southern California]] in 1934 when [[Helen Lundeberg]] and [[Lorser Feitelson]] wrote a manifesto explaining their desire to use art to convey the relationship between the perceptual and the conceptual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Sometimes this term is used to refer to [[art movements|art movement]] related to or influenced by [[surrealism]], which occurred after a so-called period of "historical surrealism".  Some have claimed that the term is unnecessary, because surrealism continues to the present day {{Who|date=January 2010}}.

Modern-day surrealist activity is sometimes called "post surrealism" by advocates of the idea that surrealism is "dead".

==History==
Both Lundeberg and Feitelman participated in a showing of art for the [[Los Angeles Art Association]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] in 1954. Along with Stephen Longstreet and [[Elise Cavanna]], the artists whose paintings were presented were known collectively as ''Functionists West''. Feitelson and Cavanna showed only non-objective works. Both artists employed flat-colored and near geometrical shapes.

Post-Surrealism was an American spin on the European-born art movement of the 20th Century. Beginning in the 1930s, artists searched for a style that would differentiate themselves from the dreamlike surrealism of Europe and more sub-conscious, earlier movements of Romanticism and Modernism. This new form of "Americana Dream" art began in Los Angeles, California. The cities' fanciful, other-worldly architecture and extravagant city-scape provided ample inspiration for burgeoning artists. Other cities such as San Francisco, New York, and Dallas became hotbeds for these creators.

While exhibiting in California in 1934, Lorser Feitelson and Helen Lundberg displayed their work under the name post-surrealism. For the first time, artists were able to separate themselves through their own name, and even formed a Surrealism group which boasted such great artists as Philip Guston, Reuben Kadish, Knud Merrild, and [[Grace Clements (artist)|Grace Clements]].

As a social movement as well as art, the works being created at this time reflected the prevalent issues throughout the country. Undoubtedly, the war was a major factor in the surrealism movement. Although the works which focused on these events were surrealist, they are now classified as Social-surrealism. Dalí influenced many social surrealists, including O. Louis Guglielmi, James Guy, Walter Quirt and David Smith, whose techniques can be seen in all of the aforementioned artists' works.

In art, '''resilience''' is the capacity of the work of art to preserve through [[aesthetics]] its particularity distinguishing it from any other object, despite the increasing subjectivization in the production of works. '''Resilience in art''' appears as a response to the gradual setting aside of [[beauty]] during the twentieth century resulting today in an inability to define the work of art.

==History==
The late nineteenth and twentieth century saw the birth of art movements such as [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Cubism]] and [[Surrealism]] which sought to adjust to the great  social, industrial, economic and political changes that were taking place at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain Besançon]], ''L'image interdite'', Fayard, 1994, p. 407, {{ISBN|2-213-59254-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel to these movements is a series of strangest movements such as [[Hirsutes]], [[Hydropathes]], [[Incohérents]]  and highly politicized and subversive movements such as [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Suprematism]], [[Futurism]] and [[Dada]]. These movements, combined with Anglo-Saxon [[Analytic Aesthetics]] from the 1950s which is characterized by the rejection of the notion of  beautiy as the foundation of art, call into question the very existence of the work of art as a specific human achievement.

The Analytic Aesthetics will base art on the consensus of the "world of art",&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Danto]],''The Artworld'' (1964) Journal of Philosophy LXI, 571-584, {{ISBN|978-0691163895}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus accepting that any object whatsoever may be considered as art as long as it is shown in a place provided for this purpose. Thus art no longer offers homogeneity linked to a cultural substratum but a plurality of individualities. It does not unfold in time, its duration often becomes ephemeral. Beauty is considered superfluous, asserting that a work of art does not have to be based on beauty, for it is self-sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nelson Goodman]] ''Languages of Art'' : ''An Approach to a Theory of Symbols''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960-61 John Locke lectures, ASIN: B000MYI510&lt;/ref&gt;

Analytic Aesthetics is rooted in the philosophy of the eighteenth century when philosophers, like [[Edmund Burke]] or [[Herbart]] claim that there is no existing beauty by itself. Beauty is not in the object itself but in the subject who experiences some emotion. Little by little, the idea of beauty gives way to the feeling of beauty. The objective definition of the beautiful becomes impossible, it is relegated to the subjective evaluation of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain Besançon]], ''L'image interdite'', Fayard, 1994, p. 267 ( Kant), {{ISBN|2-213-59254-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the theory of beauty that has been a knowledge based on mathematics since the Greeks becomes a subjective aesthetic feeling. Added to this, theories on autonomy of ugliness &lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Polin]], Du laid, du mal, du faux,   Presses universitaires de France, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; will encourage the proliferation of the most random, unsightly and provocative productions in the context of contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Clair, ''L'hiver de la culture'', Flammation, 2011, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; What one can argue with the analytic aesthetic is that in his analyzes he does not start from art as a conceptual unit but relies on the artist's achievements at a certain historical moment. Analytical philosophers choose [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s urinal and [[Andy Warhol]]'s &lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Danto]], " After the end of art", Princeton University Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; work as a foundation for their position and as a new starting point. The same can be said about postmodern thinking and the "unrepresentable" in [[Jean-François Lyotard]], which is also linked to European histories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Ranciere]], ''The Future of the Image'', Reprint Edition, pp. 150, {{ISBN|1844672972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors have had a significant impact on the confusing situation in art today. Throughout the twentieth century different fields of knowledge have focused on art: Philosophy, Sociology, Psychoanalysis, History of Art, Economy, which led to a dismemberment of the very notion of art. Each branch has emphasized some of the peculiarities of this very complex "world" that is art. Everyone has made contributions on this or that facet by losing sight of the totality. The domains have separated, each with its own criteria. As a result, follows an erroneous conclusion about the impossibility of the definition of art and the complete absence of the capacity of judgment of the quality of the works, therefore of the recognition of a production as being  art. What Lyotard will call the bursting of the "grand narratives" of modernity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Lyotard]], The "Postmodern Condition", Translated by Geoff Bennington and Brian Massumi, 1984, p. 53, {{ISBN|978-0816611737}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which envisioned humanity engaged on the path of emancipation, has contributed to the advent of the autonomous subject which becomes the finality in itself. [[Postmodern]] thinking will value differences and particularisms based solely on individual will. From there, at the level of the arts, it is only the intention of the artist that counts. With increasing subjectivization, the figure of the artist and his sensitivity will prevail over any rational approach.

==Resilience in art==
Resilience in art tends to restore the foundations of art on the beauty and restore art to unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resilienceduvivant.com|title=Résilience du vivant}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In the division of the perception between objective and subjective resilience opposes a joint operation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Lacoste]], "La philosophie de l’art", Presses Universitaires, Paris, 1981, p.125, {{ISBN|2130582575}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The beauty in the work is perceived objectively, it is the first fraction of the second where the spectator is in front of the work, then intervenes the subjective judgment in relation to the experience of this one. We now benefit from new knowledge in [[neurobiology]] which studies by [[medical imaging]] the behavior of the brain in relation to the beauty  and where actually we can record these two times in which intervenes in turn the [[neocortex]] and the archaic brain. Moreover, every individual instantly recognizes the beautiful as such,&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Changeux and [[Paul Ricoeur]], ''What Makes Us Think ?'': A Neuroscientist and a Philosopher Argue about Ethics, Human Nature, and the BrainFeb ", Princeton university press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;   which encourages the idea of the beauty  based on the structures of the world (see [[Pythagoras]], Influence on art and architecture). Follows the judgment "I like, I do not like" .&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Lemarquis, ''Portrait du cerveau en artiste'', Odile Jacob, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The indistinction of these two times certainly favored the idea of beauty as a subjective taste. This double factor is in action also during the creation by the artist. On the one hand, it takes into account his experience,&lt;ref&gt;Michel Haar, ''L'oeuvre d'art'', Hatier, 1994, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  his way of seeing the world, his knowledge and intuitions,  but also his capacity to capture and restore the world around him. To this is added the quality of elaboration and structuring of the work with the same harmony found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edgar Morin]], ''La méthode, I. La Nature de la Nature'', Seuil, 1977, p. 372&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Where contemporary art relies solely on the intention of the artist, resilience sets the artist's responsibility to the community, because art is a receiver of the "image" of the community and acts in parallel on the cohesion of it. Man is a social being, by nature he must live in society to exist, excessive individualism is impossible, these two facets must be harmoniously combined.
*Theoretically, instead of an split approach, resilience is a systemic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Changeaux, ''La Beauté dans le cerveau'', Edition Odile Jacob, 2016, p. 126, {{ISBN|978-2-7381-3468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the level of practice, resilience removes the discourse that clutters art productions and focuses on the development of the work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], ''L’Oeil et l’Esprit'', pp. 26, 27, {{ISBN|978-2070322909}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Considering that the quality of a work of art is objectively identifiable, resilience in art rules out random, purely gestural, unsightly, conceptual or only decorative productions. A work of art consists of aesthetic regime and ethical regime.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Rancière]], ''Le partage du sensible'', esthétique et politique, La Fabrique-éditions, Paris, p. 6, {{ISBN|978-2913372054}}&lt;/ref&gt;   We can rationally judge the aesthetic quality of the work and we can apprehend it by our sensitivity in its "legible" part, in what it "speaks" or what it evokes.
*Resilience relegates the ephemeral art to the game or the show and opts for the work that projects itself in the long term. One of the reasons is its formative nature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Rancière]], ''Le destin des images'', edition La fabrique, 2003, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;4° Word Congress on Resilience, https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/29e7f2_97effeb0000d4f36a4426309a4fd41f5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*At the formal level, resilience requires the diversity of expressions in place of [[contemporary art]] production, which for decades has finally generated instantly recognizable images as "contemporary art" and finished  in a new academicism &lt;ref&gt;Jean Claire, ''L’hiver de la culture'', Flammarion, Paris, 2011, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;   rejecting any other form of art as obsolete.
All cultures  generate images of themselves through art images, but not all art images are works of art. Contemporary art imposing itself as current art is perhaps the image of ours, but resilience is essential when it comes to its quality as art.&lt;ref&gt;4° Word Congress on Resilience, https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/29e7f2_37558e64d55f400eb20135099787496b.pdf p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National seminar on arts resilience, UK, http://artsdevelopmentuk.org/presentations-from-the-aduk-national-seminar-on-arts-resilience-2016/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rock Profile''''' is a British television comedy show written by and starring [[double act|comedy partnership]] [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] and [[David Walliams]], both later widely known for the [[sketch comedy|sketch show]] ''[[Little Britain]]''. ''Rock Profile'' first appeared on the channel [[UK Play]] in 1999, directed by [[Michael Cumming]], before moving to [[BBC Two]] in 2000.

The show comprises a series of spoof interviews, involving [[Jamie Theakston]] questioning Lucas and Walliams who play famous musicians. The interviews are often bizarre and involve broad, unflattering caricatures or just downright fictional characteristics. They are often interspersed with videos by the featured artist, including humorous captions and congratulations from other impersonated celebrities.

== Broadcast history ==

The first series was broadcast in 1999, comprising 13 episodes, on digital channel UK Play. The series was then picked up by BBC Two, with a second series of 13 episodes following in 2000. Series one was later shown on BBC Two. In Christmas 2000, a special 45-minute episode of the series was broadcast, entitled ''[[Rock the Blind]]''. The episode followed [[Gary Barlow]] (Lucas) and [[Ronan Keating]] (Walliams) as they recorded a charity single. [[Ted Robbins]] appeared as [[Pete Waterman]], and [[Sara Cox]] as herself. Following the episode, the series saw a break of two years.

In October 2001, several sketches were comprised for the re-launch of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', entitled ''The All-New Top of the Pops''. All of the sketches were filmed backstage, featuring characters which had appeared in the previous two series. Fans of the series were happy to see its brief return, however, people who were unaware of the show at the time did not understand the segments. Complaints were also sparked regarding the sketch featuring Lucas as [[Elton John]], who was being interviewed about his appearance on ''TOTP'', in which he performed ''[[The Lion King]]'''s main theme, "[[Circle of Life]]". A member of the audience also verbally harassed Lucas during the sketch, which resulted in the entire feature being cut from all future repeat screenings of the episode, meaning only the DVD release is the only existent source to the public to view these.

In 2009, a third series was recorded by Walliams and Lucas and was made available on the website [[Funny or Die]] for free viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2009/05/lucas_and_walliams_revive_rock_profiles.html|title=Lucas and Walliams revive Rock Profiles|work=broadcastnow.co.uk|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third series replaced host Jamie Theakston with new host [[Dermot O'Leary]]. The first episode aired virally on 11 May 2009, and featured a mock interview with [[Katie Price|Jordan]] and [[Peter Andre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funnyordie.co.uk/videos/f6bb86d6d0/rock-profile-episode-one-peter-andre-and-jordan-pt-1|title=Rock Profile:Peter Andre &amp; Jordan Pt.1|work=Funny or Die|accessdate=10 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729033635/http://www.funnyordie.co.uk/videos/f6bb86d6d0/rock-profile-episode-one-peter-andre-and-jordan-pt-1|archivedate=29 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

''Rock Profile'' has been well received by critics. ''[[Radio Times]]'' described the show as "truly silly and truly inspired". ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' described it as "excellent comedy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=Rock Profile |publisher=BBC DVD |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' called it "hilarious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/221770/Rock-Profile-on-DVD.html |title=''Rock Profile'' on DVD |last=Wood |first=Beci |date=July 26, 2005 |website=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DVD release ==

A DVD release of ''Rock Profile'' appeared in 2005, featuring both series, ''Rock the Blind'', the ''TOTP'' sketches, as well as a never-before seen commercial and sketches composed for ''The Ralf Little Show''.

'''''Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (London)''''', c. 1607/1610, is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] master [[Caravaggio]] in the [[National Gallery, London]].

The painting was discovered in a private collection in 1959. The early Caravaggio biographer [[Giovanni Bellori]], writing in 1672, mentions a ''Salome with the Head of John the Baptist'' sent by the artist to the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta in the hope of regaining favour after having been expelled from the Order in 1608. It seems likely, however, that Bellori was referring to a different painting of the same subject (see ''[[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid) (Caravaggio)|Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid)]]''). The handling and the raking light link this painting to works done in Naples during the artist's brief stay in the city during 1606–1607, an impression confirmed by the blances between Salome and the Virgin in the ''[[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|Madonna of the Rosary]]'', and between the executioner holding the head of the Baptist and one of the two torturers in ''[[Christ at the Column (Caravaggio)|Christ at the Column]]'' and ''[[The Flagellation of Christ(Caravaggio)|The Flagellation of Christ]]''.

The '''St. Louis Symphony Orchestra''' is an American [[symphony orchestra]] based in [[St. Louis]], Missouri. Founded in 1880 by Joseph Otten as the St. Louis Choral Society, the St. Louis Symphony is the second-oldest professional symphony orchestra in the United States, preceded only by the [[New York Philharmonic]]. Its principal concert venue is [[Powell Hall]].

==History==
The St. Louis Choral Society performed in the auditorium of the [[St. Louis Mercantile Library]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.gslis.utexas.edu/~landc/bookplates/20_4_StLouisMercantile.htm| last=Hoover| first=John Neal| title=St. Louis Mercantile Library| journal=Journal of Library History| volume=20| issue=4| pages=440–443| date=Fall 1985| accessdate=2008-02-21| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704154632/http://www.gslis.utexas.edu/~landc/bookplates/20_4_StLouisMercantile.htm| archivedate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Locust and Broadway in [[Downtown St. Louis]]. During the 1881/82 season the 80-member chorus was joined by an orchestra of 31 members. A disbanded Musical Union joined the group. In 1893, the St. Louis Choral-Symphony was formally incorporated. It remained largely a choral organization through its performances at the [[1904 World's Fair]] under [[Alfred Ernst]] when it expanded to a 200-member chorus and an orchestra of 55. Under [[Max Zach]]'s tenure (1907 to 1921), it changed its name to the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra.

Before moving to its current home in [[Powell Symphony Hall|Powell Hall]], the SLSO performed for many years at the [[Peabody Opera House|Kiel Opera House]]. The orchestra has given concerts regularly at [[Carnegie Hall]] and has made overseas tours to Europe and to Japan. The St. Louis Symphony has recorded for the Columbia, RCA Victor, Red Seal, Telarc, Vox/Turnabout, Angel EMI, and Nonesuch labels. It has also issued CD recordings on its own label, Arch Media, and has received seven [[Grammy Award]]s and 58 nominations. For [[Opera Theatre of Saint Louis]], the St. Louis Symphony has been the resident orchestra since 1978, divided into two ensembles, each performing two of the operas in the season.  Also associated with the orchestra is the St. Louis Symphony Chorus, which was founded in 1977. Its first director was Thomas Peck.  Since 1995, Amy Kaiser has served as the chorus director. 

The national prestige of the St. Louis Symphony grew most prominently during the music directorship of [[Leonard Slatkin]], from 1979 to 1996. During his tenure, the orchestra made many recordings for the EMI and RCA Victor labels, and toured to Europe and the Far East, as well as concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]]. However, this growth in prestige was not matched by stabilization of long-term finances. In 2000, the SLSO's endowment stood at [[United States dollar|US$]]28&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rftstl.com/Issues/2000-11-01/culture/muse.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201073602/http://www.rftstl.com/Issues/2000-11-01/culture/muse.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=1 February 2013| title=Facing the Music| work=[[Riverfront Times]]| first=Eddie| last=Silva| date=1 November 2000| accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the executive director and President of the SLSO at the time, Don Roth, had secured a US$40&amp;nbsp;million challenge grant from the Taylor family (owners of privately held [[Enterprise Rent-A-Car]]) to help the organization's money situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rftstl.com/Issues/2001-09-12/culture/muse.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130201133630/http://www.rftstl.com/Issues/2001-09-12/culture/muse.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=1 February 2013| title=Stop the Music| work=Riverfront Times| first=Eddie| last=Silva| date=12 September 2001| accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in that same year, he revealed the situation of severe financial problems with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra finances, which nearly led to the orchestra's bankruptcy in 2001. Roth resigned his position in July 2001, and was succeeded by Randy Adams, a former St. Louis bank executive. Adams embarked on extensive fund-raising efforts in the following years, seeking to enlarge the SLSO's endowment in the process. As part of the budget cuts and cost-saving measures, the musicians agreed to salary cuts over that time, and also a reduction of their 52-week contract to 42 weeks.

Following the departure of Hans Vonk as music director after the 2001-2002 season, [[Itzhak Perlman]] served as music adviser to the orchestra from 2002 to 2004. In December 2003, the symphony's board announced David Robertson as the next music director of the orchestra, effective with the 2005/06 season.  

In January 2005, a labor dispute led to a cancellation of concerts for two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0120/p11s02-almp.html |title=Symphony strike echoes across US |work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |first=Sarah Bryan |last=Miller |date=2005-01-20 |accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/04/national/04orch.html| title=Labor Dispute Halts Music in St. Louis| newspaper=The New York Times| first=Daniel J.| last=Wakin| date=4 January 2005| accessdate=2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/17/arts/music/17loui.html| title=The Silence in St. Louis Is Starting to Hurt| newspaper=The New York Times| first=Daniel J.| last=Wakin| date=17 February 2005| accessdate=2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the musicians could vote on the terms of the new contract, management changed the locks to Powell Hall without notifying them. Auditions were cancelled, and the health insurance for musicians was cancelled without notice as well.  Whilst the musicians considered themselves to be 'locked out', management considered this action to be an illegal strike, since the players' attorney, Leonard Leibowitz, had advised them against filing certain documents as required by law.  The National Labor Relations Board agreed with management. After a two-month period of negotiations, the musicians agreed to a ten-week reduction from a 52-week season, and 30% wage reductions. Upon returning to the stage, the musicians enacted a "Vote of No Confidence" on Executive Director Randy Adams. Both parties then reached a mutual agreement under which they agreed to refer to the eight-week period as a "Work Stoppage" and the "Vote of No Confidence" was rescinded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/1465.html

Since September 2005, the American conductor [[David Robertson (conductor)|David Robertson]] has been the music director of the orchestra.  During Robertson's tenure, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra has partnered with [[KWMU|St. Louis Public Radio]] to broadcast its subscription concerts live every Saturday night during its regular season, since the fall of 2010, after the sale of the St. Louis classical radio station [[KFUO-FM|KFUO]].  Robertson conducted the orchestra's first-ever appearance at [[The Proms]] in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Tim| last=Ashley| title=Prom 71: St Louis Symphony/Robertson| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/05/prom-71-st-louis-symphony-review| work=[[The Guardian]]| location=Manchester| date=2012-09-05| accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 2013, Robertson's contract was extended through the 2015/16 season, and a further contract extension, announced in March 2014, was through the 2017/18 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=https://www.stlsymphony.org/en/about-us/press-room/current-press-releases-and-archives/2014/2014-3-04-david-robertson-contract-extension/| title=St. Louis Symphony Announces Contract Extension with Music Director David Robertson through 2017–2018| publisher=St. Louis Symphony| date=4 March 2014| accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2016, the SLSO and Robertson jointly announced an additional one-year extension of his contract through the 2018-2019 season, at which time he is scheduled to conclude his SLSO tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Sarah Bryan| last=Miller| title=David Robertson will leave the SLSO at end of 2018-19 season| url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/culture-club/david-robertson-will-leave-the-slso-at-end-of-/article_b1d51d29-2408-588d-9612-f902d7927f76.html| work=[[St Louis Post-Dispatch]]| date=2016-12-20| accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2017, the orchestra noted an update to Robertson's contract, where he is scheduled to conclude his tenure in 2017-2018, in a reversion of the December 2016 situation.&lt;ref name="Deneve2017"&gt;{{cite press release| url=https://www.stlsymphony.org/en/about-us/press-room/current-press-releases-and-archives/2017/06-07-17---Stephane-Deneve-Named-Music-Director-of-the-St-Louis-Symphony/| title=Stéphane Denève Named Music Director of the St. Louis Symphony| publisher=St. Louis Symphony| date=7 June 2017| accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams stood-down as the orchestra's president and executive director in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra, "SLSO President and Executive Director Randy Adams Announces Resignation".

''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', 15 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Faced with declining ticket sales and deficits, Bronstein immediately launched an aggressive new revenue plan with audience development at the core of its actions. Bronstein has also taken steps to broaden and diversify the symphony's programming through popularly oriented programming series such as "Live at Powell Hall". Since 2008, because of new programming and marketing strategies, ticket revenues have grown 39% in the 2012 fiscal year, the highest revenues in over a decade, while seats sold grew by 16% and more than 31,000 new people were added to the customer base, reversing five years of decline. Because of successful audience development initiatives at the core of the plan as well as other revenue progress and strong management of expenses, the structural deficit (whose gaps are funded by additional contributions) has declined 18% from $3.4M in 2007 to $2.8M in 2011, dipping as low as $2.62m in 2010.

Symphony management undertook a rebranding in 2010, by adopting of a new logo and a new look and changing its name from the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra (SLSO) to the St. Louis Symphony. The move was not received with universal approval, and many, including members of the local news media, proved resistant to the marketing-based change. The name was changed back, without fanfare, in the summer of 2017.

Bronstein left the SLSO to head the Peabody Conservatory in Spring 2014. In February 2015, the SLSO named Marie-Hélène Bernard, then-president of the [[Handel and Haydn Society]] as its new president and CEO. She began her new job on July 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/culture-club/st-louis-symphony-orchestra-names-new-president-and-ceo/article_96036f5f-6c33-542a-a7e1-ec93734433b0.html| title=St. Louis Symphony Orchestra names new president and CEO| work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch| first=Sarah Bryan| last=Miller| date=2015-02-11| accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Saint Louis Symphony Youth Orchestra|STL Symphony Youth Orchestra]] was established in 1970 by Leonard Slatkin.  The post of Resident Conductor (formerly Assistant Conductor), who also acts as music director of the Saint Louis Symphony Youth Orchestra, is currently held by Gemma New.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/culture-club/slso-appoints-gemma-new-as-resident-conductor/article_1357a9af-3906-58e3-9a18-00f0b8d64532.html| title=SLSO appoints Gemma New as resident conductor| work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch| first=Sarah Bryan| last=Miller| date=2016-06-02| accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past St. Louis Symphony Orchestra Assistant Conductors have included Slatkin, Gerhardt Zimmermann, David Loebel, David Amado, Scott Parkman, [[Ward Stare]], and Steven Jarvi.

In 2003, [[Stéphane Denève]] first guest-conducted the orchestra.  In June 2017, the orchestra named Denève as its next music director, effective with the 2019-2020 season, with an initial contract of 3 seasons.  He is to hold the title of Music Director Designate for the 2018-2019 season.&lt;ref name="Deneve2017"/&gt;

[[File:Whriling dervishes, Rumi Fest 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Whirling Dervishes]], at Rumi Fest 2007]]

'''Sufi whirling''' (or Sufi turning) ({{lang-tr|Semazen}}) is a form of physically active [[meditation]] which originated among [[Sufism|Sufi]]s, and which is still practiced by the Sufi [[Dervish]]es of the [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi]] order and other orders such as the Rifa'i-Marufi.  It is a customary meditation practice performed within the [[Sema]], or worship ceremony, through which dervishes (also called ''semazens'', from [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa|سماعزن}}) aim to reach the source of all perfection, or kemal. This is sought through abandoning one's [[nafs]], [[egos]] or personal desires, by listening to the music, focusing on [[God]], and spinning one's body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the [[Solar System]] orbiting the sun.&lt;ref name="MOA sema"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm|title=The Sema of the Mevlevi|publisher=Mevlevi Order of America|accessdate=2009-03-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121221021339/http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm|archivedate=21 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mevlevi practice gave rise to an Egyptian form, ''tanoura'', distinguished by the use of a multicolored skirt. This has also developed into a [[performance dance]] by non-Sufis, including dancers outside the [[Islamic world]].

== Origin ==
[[Image:Dansende derwisjen Rijksmuseum SK-A-4081.jpeg|thumb|''Mevlevi dervishes whirling in [[Beyoğlu|Pera]]'' by [[Jean-Baptiste van Mour]]]]

"In the 12th century, Sufi fraternities ({{lang|ar|طرائق}} ''[[tariqa|ṭarāʾiq]]'') were first organized as an established leadership in which a member followed a prescribed discipline in service to a sheikh or master in order to establish rapport with him."&lt;ref name="Dervish EBO"&gt;"Dervish." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 21 Sept. 2009 [http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-9030024 Dervish]&lt;/ref&gt; A member of such a fraternity is referred to as a Persian ''darwish.''&lt;ref name="Dervish EBO"/&gt; These turuk (plural of tariqa) were responsible for organizing an Islamic expression of religious life, often founded by independent saints or resulted from the division of existing orders.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"&gt;MacDonald, D.B. "Darwish (Darwesh)." Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P.B. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2009. Brill Online. Augustana. 21 September 2009. [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-1731 Darwish (Darwesh)]&lt;/ref&gt; Each Sufi tariqa stems from a unique ''silsila'', or "chain of order" in which a member must learn, as the ''silsila'' binds each member to Allah through one's chain of order.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; One's ''silsila'' extends through the member's individual teacher, to their teacher and so on, through time until one is connected to the Prophet and thus Allah.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; The Prophet himself is revered as the originator of Sufism, which has in turn been traced down through a series of saints.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt;

== Practice ==
{{Sufism}}
A dervish practices multiple rituals, the primary of which is the ''[[dhikr]]'', a remembering of Allah.&lt;ref name="Dervish EBO"/&gt; The ''dhikr'' involves recitation of devotional Islamic prayer. This ''dhikr'' is coupled with physical exertions of movement, specifically dancing and whirling, in order to reach a state assumed by outsiders to be one of "ecstatic trances".&lt;ref name="Dervish EBO"/&gt; As explained by Sufis:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160306104925/http://whirlingdervishes.org/whirlingdervishes.htm The Whirling Dervishes of Rumi]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the symbolism of the Sema ritual, the semazen's camel's hair hat (sikke) represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt (''tennure'') represents the ego's shroud. By removing his black cloak (''hırka''), he is spiritually reborn to the truth. At the beginning of the Sema, by holding his arms crosswise, the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus testifying to God's unity. While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive God's beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth. The semazen conveys God's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema. Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love. The human being has been created with love in order to love. Mevlâna Jalâluddîn [[Rumi]] says, "All loves are a bridge to Divine love. Yet, those who have not had a taste of it do not know!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the Mevlevi order, the practice of ''dhikr'' is performed in a traditional dress: a ''tennure'', a sleeveless white frock, the ''destegul'', a long sleeved jacket, a belt, and a black overcoat or ''khirqa'' to be removed before the whirling begins.&lt;ref name="Schimmel1975"/&gt; As the ritual dance begins, the dervish dons a felt cap, a ''sikke'', in addition to a turban wrapped around the head, a trademark of the Mevlevi order.&lt;ref name="Schimmel1975"/&gt; The sheikh leads the ritual with strict regulations. To begin,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The sheikh stands in the most honored corner of the dancing place, and the dervishes pass by him three times, each time exchanging greetings, until the circling movement starts. The rotation itself is on the left foot, the center of the rotation being the ball of the left foot and the whole surface of the foot staying in contact with the floor. The impetus for the rotation is provided by the right foot, in a full 360-degree step. If a dervish should become too enraptured, another Sufi, who is in charge of the orderly performance, will gently touch his frock in order to curb his movement, The dance of the dervishes is one of the most impressive features of the mystical life in Islam, and the music accompanying it is of exquisite beauty, beginning with the great hymn in honor of the Prophet (na't-i sharif, written by Jalaluddin himself) and ending with short, enthusiastic songs, some things sung in Turkish.&lt;ref name="Schimmel1975"&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie.

The Western world, having witnessed Sufi whirling through tourism, have described the various forms of ''dhikr'' as "barking, howling, dancing, etc."&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; The practice of each ''tariqa'' is unique to its individual order, specific traditions and customs may differ across countries. The same ''tariqa'' in one country will not mirror that of another country as each order's ritual stresses "emotional religious life" in various forms.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; The Mevleviyah order, like many others, practice the ''dhikr'' by performing a whirling meditation. Accompanying the ''dhikr'' practices of whirling and prayer, the custom of ''sama'' serves to further one's "nourishment of the soul" through devotional "hearing" of the "'subtle' sounds of the hidden world or of the cosmos."&lt;ref name="Sama BO"&gt;During, J.; Sellheim, R. "Sama". ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2009. BRill Online. Augustana. 21 Sept. 2009 [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_COM-0992 Sama]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the use of ''sama'', whirling and devotional prayer in the practice of ''dhikr'', the ''tariqa'' orders perform Sufi whirling in addition to playing musical instruments, consuming glowing embers, live scorpions and glass, puncturing body parts with needles and spikes, or practicing clairvoyance and levitation.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; The dervish practice can be performed by community residents or lay members, members have typically been those of lower classes.&lt;ref name="Dervish EBO"/&gt; Within Islamic faith, unlike Middle Eastern law, women have equal status to men, allowing women to participate in ''dhikr'' as dervishes themselves.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; Women were received into a ''tariqa'' order by a male sheikh, but traditionally were instructed to practice the ''dhikr'' alone or with an established branch of females within a specific order.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; Sufi whirling, a worship of ''dhikr'', became a gender and class neutral practice throughout the Central Islamic region.

The custom of ''[[sama (Sufism)|sama]]'' among Sufi orders has a history of controversy within the Islamic faith. In one argument, the use of the term ''sama'' is considered to suggest physically "listening" in a spiritual context.&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt; A differing opinion argues that ''sama'' is in fact "hearing", as "to hear" can pertain to any sound in addition to any "subtle" sounds of the spiritual realm.&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt; Those in support of ''sama'' further claim that the term is actually synonymous with "understanding" and therefore recognition and application of the Revelation as well as the act of "attaining higher knowledge."&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt; The spread of ''sama'' among Sufi orders began some time around the mid 3rd/9th century C.E. in Baghdad, eventually finding acceptance and favor in Persian, Turkish and Indian Islam.&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt; The custom of ''sama'' evolved in practice over time as it complimented Sufi ''dhkir'', whirling and among some orders dancing and a meal.&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt; Rules of propriety and conditions were adopted upon the widespread concern surrounding the necessity of ''sama'' with the ''dhikr''; in order to distinguish between entertainment and valuable spiritual practice, the ''sama'' was distinguished as heard from the ego, heart or spirit.&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt; Despite the application of rules, some sheikhs continued to limit or disapprove the practice of ''sama''. While controversy continuously questioned the place of ''sama'' in Sufi orders, the music itself was not affected.&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt; More recently, the custom of ''sama'' is most commonly performed within a ''dhikr'' ceremony. Those in support of ''sama'' continue to argue that "according to that which it is not ''sama'' and dance which induce ecstasy, but ecstasy which arouses dance, or furthermore, that ''sama'' is only a revealing instrument and that it only supplies that which is brought to it by the hearer."&lt;ref name="Sama BO"/&gt;

In 2005, [[UNESCO]] proclaimed the "[[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi]] [[Sema|Sema Ceremony]]" of [[Turkey]] as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/39eur_uk.htm The Mevlevi Sema Ceremony] [[UNESCO]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
Dervish communities, in the Middle Ages, served a central role in social, religious and political life throughout "central Islamic lands."&lt;ref name="Dervish EBO"/&gt; Dervish orders were at one time much larger in size than they are today, as the government has taken control over most Dervish monasteries throughout this area.&lt;ref name="Darwesh EoI"/&gt; In 1925, Turkey ordered the dissolution of all Sufi fraternities by decree, the Mevlevi managed to survive among small villages throughout the Middle East.&lt;ref name="Mawlawiyah EBO"/&gt; In 1954, the Turkish government granted the [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi order]] a special permission to perform ritual whirling practices for tourists during two weeks each year.&lt;ref name="Mawlawiyah EBO"/&gt; Outside of tourist entertainment, Orthodox theologians have now vocally discounted the Dervish practice resulting in ''faqirs'', or wandering, mendicant dervishes throughout central Islamic regions.&lt;ref name="Dervish EBO"/&gt; Despite strict government control over Dervish practices, the Mevleviyah order continued its existence in Turkey to this day.&lt;ref name="Mawlawiyah EBO"&gt;"Mawlawiyah." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 21 Sept. 2009. [http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-9051529 Mawlawiyah]&lt;/ref&gt;

While only men have historically been permitted to take part in the ceremony, some communities now allow women to participate.&lt;ref name="changeafoot"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/12/16/turkey.whirling.dervishes/ |title=Change is afoot for 800-year-old whirling dance |first=Mohammed |last=Jamjoom |work=CNN |publisher=Turner Broadcasting System |date=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional and secular forms==
==={{anchor|Tanoura}}Egyptian tanoura===
[[File:Tanoura Dance, Egypt.jpg|thumb|Egyptian tanoura dancers]]
In [[Egypt]], the practice of whirling has been adapted as '''tanoura''' ({{lang-ar|التنورة}} ''{{transl|ar|el-tanoura}}''). The word ''tanoura'' or ''tannoura'' refers to the [[tanoura (skirt)|colorful skirt]] worn by the whirler, with a color representing each [[Sufi order]].&lt;ref name=feedfury&gt;[http://entertainment.feedfury.com/content/34279531-egyptian-folk-dance-tanoura.html Egyptian Folk Dance Tanoura at entertainment.feedfury.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The word may also refer to the dancer, traditionally a Sufi man.&lt;ref name=feedfury/&gt; Tanoura is associated with Sufism and is performed at Sufi festivals, but it is also performed by non-Sufis as a [[folk dance]] or [[concert dance]].

Although it is mainly used for visual effects, the dancers also augment their balance with the tanoura, through a dynamic centrifugal effect.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Pakistan===
In Sufi shrines in Pakistan, such as the [[Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar|Lal shrine]] in [[Sehwan]], [[Sindh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.outlookpakistan.com/deadliest-sehwan-attack-fails-to-bar-devotees-from-holding-dhamaal-at-shrine/6231/ |title=Deadliest Sehwan attack fails to bar devotees from holding Dhamaal at shrine |first=Atique |last=Sherwan |work=Outlook Pakistan |date=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Akhtar|first1=Suleman|title=Damadam mast Qalandar is a cry of rebellion against established orders|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1315839/damadam-mast-qalandar-is-a-cry-of-rebellion-against-established-orders|accessdate=22 February 2017|publisher=Dawn|date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the practice of Sufi whirling is called ''Dhamaal'' and is performed to honor Sufi saints, or [[Qalandar (title)|qalandar]]s.&lt;ref name="PAA2015"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sci-int.com/pdf/46353304515%20Special%20issue%202%20Shaheer%20Ellahi%20Exploring%20the%20Sufi%20Dance%20in%20Pakistan.pdf |author=Shaheer Ellahi Khan |title=Sufi Dance in Pakistan: Anthropological Insights on the Concept and Origin of ''Dhamal'' |journal=Science International |volume=27 |number=2 |year=2015 |pages=1641–1643}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Turkish practice, Dhamaal may be practiced by any devotee – priests as well as pilgrims. Dhamaal is usually preceded by the beating of a drum (naghara) and ringing of bells, as pilgrims raise their hands, start to skip steps standing at one place and gradually work into a trance as the beats get faster. As the beats get faster, rhythms change and the drum beats are accompanies by the playing of [[shehnai]].

Practitioners associate the dance with [[Lal Shahbaz Qalandar]] and with protests following the [[Battle of Karbala]]. They regard the rhythm of the drum to evoke the rhythm of the creation of the universe, as illustrated in the concept of [[Kun (Islamic term)|''Kun Fyakun'']].&lt;ref name="PAA2015"/&gt;

===In the West===
[[File:Whirling Dancer.jpg|thumb|Whirling dancer, performing in a modern costume]]
The tanoura tradition has attracted some interest from [[Western world|Westerners]] in the [[belly dancing]] community. These performers include both men and women, solo and in groups. Such performances may be augmented with [[pyrotechnics]] or props, such as veils, wings and ribbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gildedserpent.com/cms/2013/01/11/whirling-tanoura-nicole/#axzz42cy63H97 |title=Whirling: Meditation in Motion or Spectacular Show? |first=Nicole |last=McLaren |date=11 January 2013 |work=Gilded Serpent}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=March 2016}}
The techniques used in Egyptian Tanoura can also be adopted by belly dancers to help with their balance and control dizziness.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Sufi whirling has also been promoted by actor and memoirist [[Annabelle Gurwitch]] as a form of stress relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video |url=http://www.doctoroz.com/episode/14-days-shut-down-your-sugar-cravings?video_id=3825535920001 |title=How to Tell if You're a Member of the 4 A.M.

Dervish whirling is an ancient technique. It's from the 13th century in Turkey. |access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
A defining feature of whirling is continuous [[rotation]] (clockwise or counterclockwise) around a central [[radical axis]] while avoiding [[vertigo]]. In untrained dancers, this sustained rotation causes [[dizziness]] or motion-induced vertigo. Training for whirling {{clarify span|targets the [[inner ear]]|date=June 2016}}, which is responsible for balance functions in humans. To counteract this effect, whirling dance performers practice various balancing and psychological techniques {{such as?}}.

==Records==
[[Guinness World Record]]s for "most Sufi whirls in one hour" were awarded in London in 2012, to Shafik Ibrahim Abd El Hamed in the male category with 2,905 rotations, and Tara Lee Oakley in the female category with 2,191.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxYrazfB3uE |title=World Record for Sufi Whirling |work=Afaq |publisher=[[BBC Arabic Television]] |year=2012 |language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; These records were surpassed in Zurich in 2015 by Nicole McLaren, with 3,552 rotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lukhi |first=Angela |url=http://newsivity.com/news/dancer-nicole-mclaren-puts-her-fans-in-a-record-breaking-spin-in-switzerland |date=23 March 2015 |title=Dancer Nicole McLaren puts her fans in a record-breaking spin in Switzerland |work=Newsivity |publisher=Guavo Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4729">The '''Symphony No. 5''' is a composition for [[baritone]], [[mezzo-soprano]], and [[orchestra]] by the American composer [[John Harbison]].  The work was commissioned by the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] under the conductor [[James Levine]].  It was given its world premiere in [[Boston]] on April 17, 2008 by the mezzo-soprano [[Kate Lindsey]], the baritone [[Nathan Gunn]], and the Boston Symphony Orchestra directed by James Levine.  The text of the piece is set to ''Orpheus and Eurydice'' by [[Czesław Miłosz]], ''Relic'' by [[Louise Glück]], and the ''[[Sonnets to Orpheus]]'' by [[Rainer Maria Rilke]].&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{cite web |last=Harbison |first=John |authorlink=John Harbison |year=2007 |title=Symphony No. 5 |publisher=[[G.

==Composition==
The symphony has a duration of roughly 35 minutes and is composed in four [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Con fuoco
#Andante cantabile
#Grave
#Lento

Though it was originally conceived as a purely orchestral work, Harbison decided to add vocal parts to the symphony at the suggestion of James Levine.  The first two movements are set to the text of [[Czesław Miłosz]]'s ''Orpheus and Eurydice'', while the third and fourth movements are set to [[Louise Glück]]'s ''Relic'' and [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s ''[[Sonnets to Orpheus]]'', respectively.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is composed for solo baritone and mezzo-soprano and a large orchestra comprising three [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (3rd doubling [[piccolo]]), three [[oboe]]s (3rd doubling [[Cor anglais|English horn]]), three [[clarinet]]s (2nd doubling [[E-flat clarinet]]; 3rd doubling [[bass clarinet]]), two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], two [[trumpet]]s, two [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], three percussionists, [[piano]], [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[electric guitar]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
The symphony has received a positive response from music critics.  Reviewing the world premiere, Jeremy Eichler of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called it "an accomplished four-movement work that has extremely prominent roles for baritone and mezzo-soprano."  He continued:{{quote|The vocal writing is sensitive and compelling across all four movements, and Harbison's orchestra, spiked with an electric guitar (played by composer [[Michael Gandolfi]]), is lean and concise, full of imaginative sounds and percussion effects, but most of all, extremely responsive to the imagery suggested by the poetry at hand. When Milosz's Orpheus descends into a surreal underworld of endless corridors and elevators, the orchestra descends with him; when Eurydice begins her journey back, we hear a haunting passage full of dissociated, zombie-like string writing. The other movements show a similarly keen responsiveness to text, especially as rendered by last night's fine soloists, Nathan Gunn and Kate Lindsey.&lt;ref name="Globe" /&gt;}}
David Wright of the ''Boston Classical Review'' described the piece as "an arresting meditation on grief and the hereafter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=David |title=BSO, Bělohlávek offer arresting Harbison, mixed Beethoven |work=Boston Classical Review |date=December 2, 2011 |url=http://bostonclassicalreview.com/2011/12/bso-belohlavek-offer-arresting-harbison-mixed-beethoven/ |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At a later performance of the piece, Jeremy Eichler called it "an artful and moving work" and wrote, "The movements based on Glück and Rilke fill out the picture, the latter set with the two vocal lines in vivid canon. No detail feels incidental, every gesture speaks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eichler |first=Jeremy |title=Harbison’s Fifth returns to BSO |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=December 2, 2011 |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2011/12/02/harbison-fifth-returns-bso/MPSrtq69eW1HoRxG5EsdoJ/story.html |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Diary of a Teenage Girl: An Account in Words and Pictures''''' is a diaristic graphic novel by author and artist [[Phoebe Gloeckner]]. It is notable for its hybrid form, composed of both prose and "comics" passages, each contributing to the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Meisha|title=Multi-modality in Phoebe Gloeckner's The Diary of a Teenage Girl|journal=International Journal of Comic Art|date=2007|volume=2|issue=9|pages=396–412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 2002, the book has been called "autobiography" or "semi-autobiography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Groth|first1=Gary|title=The Phoebe Gloeckner Interview|url=http://www.tcj.com/phoebe-gloeckner-2/|website=The Comics Journal|accessdate=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is told by its protagonist Minnie Goetze, a 15-year-old girl living in San Francisco, CA. The year is 1976, and Minnie, the daughter of a young single mother, loses her virginity to her mother's boyfriend, Monroe Rutherford, and soon thereafter begins writing obsessively in her diary. As she careens towards coming-of-age, she searches for love but confuses it with sex. The book presents a complex and jarring look into the interior life of an adolescent girl, and has been described as raw and disturbing, not only because of its subject matter, but because of Minnie's frank and precociously intelligent point of view and commentary on the lives of the adults in her midst.

==Plot==
Minnie Goetz is a 15-year-old girl living in San Francisco with her mother Charlotte, who was a teenager when Minnie was born, and her younger sister Gretel. Minnie begins keeping a diary after her mother's on-again, off-again boyfriend Munroe begins to make sexual advances towards her. Munroe takes her out drinking to a bar one day and initiates sex between them.

Minnie has mixed feelings about her relationship with Munroe, feeling attracted to him sexually but resenting the way he treats her and the secretive nature of their relationship. She longs to confide in her mother about Munroe but feels she cannot as Munroe and her mother still sleep together and she has a cold relationship with her mother as she once heard her step-father Pascal refer to her need to be held and touched by her mother as "sexual".

Minnie begins to sleep with more boys her own age but is disappointed and disillusioned to find that they make fun of her with their friends. She begins to spend more time with her friend Kimmie, who prostitutes herself to various friends and neighbours for petty cash. Through Kimmie, Minnie begins to take drugs for the first time.

Munroe begins a mail order business for diet pills. His goal is to be rich and retire by the time he is 40 which Minnie disapproves of as a goal. After listening to his motivational tapes she decides she wants to be a cartoonist. She writes a fan letter to [[Aline Kominsky-Crumb]] who writes one back to her. Minnie also begins skipping more classes and is thrown out of school for her poor attendance. She is forced to attend a public school and is only accepted on a trial basis on the strength of her artistic talents.

The '''''Divine Comedy Symphony''''' is [[Robert W. Smith (musician)|Robert W. Smith]]’s first complete [[symphonic band]] [[symphony]]. It was based on [[Dante]]'s epic, [[The Divine Comedy]]. Smith had studied this, and Homer’s [[Odyssey]], at Troy.

The classical symphony consists of four movements – each following a distinct pattern.&lt;ref name="Rohner2005"&gt;{{cite book

==Movement One: “The Inferno”==
“The Inferno” was commissioned by the [[James Madison University]] Band, and was completely published in 1995. The movement follows the events of the epic poem, using musical references to the events in select [[canto]]s of ''Inferno''. An Oboe solo in B-flat minor begins the symphony,then, Enormous crescendos, violent percussion, and towering blocks of sound quickly lead the audience into Dante’s vision of hell. A furious ostinato is used three times in this piece, first by [[flute]]s, then [[clarinet]]s, and finally by the [[saxophone]]s. In typical [[overture]] form, the song slows down as Dante makes his way down in the very depths of hell. Each of the movements in this symphony have a vocal effect, and in the Inferno, this takes the form of howls of pain, balanced rhythmically with whip cracks. The piece takes a coda, and finishes with an extremely difficult timpani solo accompanied by violent and sporadic hits of the [[gong]], although many performances however, omit this solo and instead have the timpani rolling into silence on a B-flat due to the difficulty.  The [[oboe]], [[piccolo]], and [[timpani]] feature prominently in this movement.

==Movement Two: “Purgatorio”==
Also commissioned by the James Madison University Band and published in 1997, Purgatorio continues Dante's epic through expressive solos and percussion rhythms.  The piece is separated into three main parts:  a lilting, dragging theme accented by [[soprano saxophone]] and flute solos, the Earthquake (which encompasses most of the piece), and the return of the original melody.  Vocalizations occur frequently during this piece, first with certain players "moaning in pain" as they drag heavy loads, then with the chants of "Gloria in Excelsis Deo" during the Earthquake, and finally with singing.  During the first and last parts of the piece, most of the band drags their feet on the ground before stomping in a repetitive rhythm.  The soprano saxophone is the featured instrument in the piece, playing notable solos that usually herald transitions between parts; this instrument leads the band all the way to the end of the piece, as the souls' footsteps gradually fade into the distance.  The piece begins in the key of D minor, modulates to C minor for the Earthquake section, and then modulates back to D minor for the conclusion of the piece.

==Movement Three: “The Ascension”==

Commissioned by the [[George Mason University]] Band, "The Ascension" represents Dante's ascension into heaven.  The piece follows typical overture form, starting out with Dante looking up to the stars atop Mount Purgatory.  A swift [[French horn|horn]] motif starts Dante's ascension, moving faster than thought.  Technically difficult woodwind runs add to the speed of Dante's ascension, as well as loud, dissonant trombone glissandos.  The middle of the piece slows down, where the band sings accompanied by bowed [[vibraphone]] and pitched wine glasses.  The opening theme of the movement is repeated in the woodwinds, while the remainder of the band sings "alleluia."  After a short horn solo, the music of the gods and of heaven builds to a climax with a trumpet solo, which is then expanded on by the rest of the band.  The piece then speeds up again with the same horn motif, finishing with a climactic and dramatic crescendo to the final note, as Dante finally arrives in Heaven.  The movement begins in E-flat major, modulates to C minor, then modulates to B-flat major at the trumpet solo.  When the horn motif returns, the piece once again modulates to C minor, where it stays for the rest of the piece. This movement prominently features horn, [[trumpet]], and [[piano]].

==Movement Four: “Paradiso”==
Published in 1996, the final movement of the symphony is a piece filled with emotion and powerful music.  The piece uses an extended [[mallet percussion]] section to introduce itself, before handing the melody over to the horns in four-part harmony.  The vocalization reveals itself quite early in the piece, as the rest of the band sings "ah" to the oboe solo.  The mallet percussion cuts off where the timpani begins.  The theme from the beginning of "The Ascension" serves as the theme for the final half of the piece.  After a modulation, the music rises dramatically into a final suspended note, as Dante finally "glimpses the face of God".  A timpani solo accents the sustained note, and rolls into the full band's final, triumphant note.  The composer designed the opening of the song to act as Dante's rise into Heaven:  with each new beam of light that appears, another mallet percussion part or rhythm is added to the building melody.  The piece is the shortest of the four at almost five minutes and is easily the piece that is most filled with raw emotion.  It begins in the key of E-flat major, and modulates into the key of F major during the return of the theme from "The Ascension."

* The 1570 ''Siege of Malta'', written in the immediate aftermath of the events by the Cretan writer [[Antonios Achelis]], is a classical work of [[Cretan Greek]] literature.
* ''[[Eight-Pointed Cross]]'' (2011) by Marthese Fenech remains faithful to historical events and tells the story from the perspectives of a Maltese family and an Ottoman family. The narrative culminates with Dragut's 1551 raid of Gozo. Work on the sequel, which focuses on the Siege of 1565, is currently underway.
* [[Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[The Siege of Malta (novel)|The Siege of Malta]]'', written in 1831-1832, was not published until 2008.
* [[Roger Crowley]]'s ''Empires of The Sea'' (2008) has a lengthy section on the siege of Malta.

Modern authors have attempted to capture the desperation and ferocity of the siege, with varying degrees of success.

* ''[[Angels in Iron]]'' (2004) by [[Nicholas Prata]] remains faithful to the historical narrative and tells the story from a distinctly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] point of view.
* The Great Siege, Malta 1565, Ernle Bradford (1961)
* The novel ''[[Ironfire: An Epic Novel of Love and War]]'' (2003) by [[David Wadsworth Ball|David W. Ball]] is the story of kidnapping, slavery and revenge leading up to the siege of Malta. It takes a somewhat less sympathetic view of the Catholic Knights Hospitaller and maintains a more romantic approach. (The British edition is called "The Sword and the Scimitar.")
* The novel ''The Religion'' (2006) by [[Tim Willocks]] tells the story of the siege through the eyes of a fictional mercenary called Mattias Tannhauser, who is on Malta fighting (at times) alongside the Knights (referred to primarily as ''The Religion''), while trying to locate the bastard son of a Maltese noblewoman.  In this attempt his opponent is a high-ranking member of the [[Roman Inquisition|Inquisition]]. The story presents a picture of both sides of the conflict without romanticising or sanitising the content for modern consumption.
* The novel ''[[Blood Rock]]'' (2008) by James Jackson tells the story of the siege with a focus on a fictional English mercenary called Christian Hardy. Throughout the siege, Hardy works to discover the identity of the traitor within The Religion who works to ensure a Moslem victory. The traitor works on behalf of the French king, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], who believed that peace with the Ottoman Empire was in the French interest and that the marauding Knights Hospitaller, by annoying the Sultan, threatened the security of France.
*It is the main plot of ''[[Pirates of Christ]]'' (2007), the historical novel by [[Edward Lamond]].&lt;ref name="Pirates of Christ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piratesofchrist.com|title=Website for 'Pirates of Christ' novel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dorothy Dunnett]] in "[[The Disorderly Knights]]" (1966), the third volume of The "[[Lymond Chronicles]]", gives a detailed fiction account of the events of 1551 in Malta, Gozo and Tripoli. Although several of the characters are fictional, the bulk of the personages are historical.
* In the video game ''[[Age of Empires III]]'', released in 2005, the story-based campaign mode has a fictional account of the siege of Malta.
* ''Clash Of Empires: The Great Siege'' (2011), a novel written by [[Christopher Hart (novelist)|Christopher Hart]], under the pen name William Napier, focuses on how the events of 1565 effected Nicholas Ingoldsby, a fictional English character, and  the son of one of the Knights of St. John.
* The novel ''The sword and the scimitar'' (2012), by [[Simon Scarrow]], is set around the Siege of Malta, and recounts events through the eyes of the disgraced veteran Knight Sir Thomas Barrett (a fictional character),  who is secretly searching for a hidden scroll that is in the possession of the Knights of St. John, that could threaten the reign of his Queen, [[Elizabeth I]].
* The novel ''The Course of Fortune'' (J. Boylston, 2015), by [[Tony Rothman]], published in three volumes, recounts the events leading up to the Siege of Malta beginning with the 1551 raid on Gozo, in which the corsair Turgut Reis enslaved the island's entire population.  The story is told through the eyes of a young Spanish mercenary and relies heavily on early and original sources.

'''''The Marathon Family''''' ({{lang-sh|Maratonci trče počasni krug}}, lit. ''Marathon Runners Do a Lap of Honour'', or often simply ''Maratonci'', lit. ''The Marathon Runners'') is a 1982 [[Cinema of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav black comedy film]] written by [[Dušan Kovačević]] and directed by [[Serbia]]n director [[Slobodan Šijan]]. It has become a [[cult film]] in Serbia and other countries from the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Disintegration in Frames|last=Levi|first=Pavle|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9780804753685|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Sdi63FxE7EC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;pg=PA60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is regarded as one of the classics of Yugoslav Serbian cinematography.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

==Plot==
The story takes place in an unnamed small Serbian town in 1935, and focuses on the Topalović family consisting of six generations of [[undertaker]]s: gravely ill Pantelija, wheelchair-bound Maksimilijan who's also mute and nearly deaf, rheumatic Aksentije, sober-minded Milutin, impulsive and narcissistic Laki, and young and naive Mirko. Constantly bickering amongst each other, the latest family arguments arise from the youngest son, Mirko, not wanting to continue the family business of coffin-making. Deeply in love with a local girl Kristina, the daughter of a local hoodlum Bili Piton, he's looking to avoid the career path of his father, grandfather, great grandfather, etc. 

Though operating out of a prominently located shop in the town, Topalovićs' business is mostly based on illegal activities. Instead of making brand new coffins, they simply recycle already used ones with the help of Bili Piton, whose men dig them out from the local cemetery during the night. Once they get their hands on the coffins that had been dug up, Topalovićs simply refurbish them and sell them as new, thereby making a large profit with very little [[overhead cost|overhead]]. Based on mutual financial interest, the business relationship between Topalovićs and Bili is deteriorating by the day as they owe him a large sum of money for the past services rendered and show no intention of paying him.

In parallel, Topalovićs are in the finishing stages of building a modern [[crematory]] on which they're placing high hopes as the future source of income.

One day, the oldest Topalović, Pantelija, dies and leaves family inheritance to himself because he does not trust his successors. Topalovićs leave business with Bili Piton and he threatens to report them to the police for killing a man in a car accident. Bili's daughter, Mirko's love Kristina wishes to become an actress in (mostly pornographic) movies made by Mirko's best friend Đenka. However, she cheats on Mirko with Đenka, so outraged Mirko kills her when he finds out. He returns to his family and makes himself their leader by force, while Đenka is accidentally burned alive by the deaf Maksimilijan, while repairing the crematorium. The movie ends with a showdown between the Topalovićs and Bili Piton, in which Bili Piton is killed, and then a chase between Topalovićs and the police, with a scene abruptly cut just as raging Mirko attempts to run over a police officer fallen from a bicycle.

==Awards==
The Marathon Family won two awards in 1982, including the Jury Prize at the [[Montréal World Film Festival]] and the "Best Actress" award at the [[Pula Film Festival]], which went to [[Seka Sablić]] for her portrayal of Kristina.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084302/awards?ref_=tt_awd imdb awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag''''' is an art [[art installation|installation]] by John Sims. The controversial installation consists of a [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]] hanging from a noose at a 13-foot gallows. ''The Proper way to Hang a Confederate Flag'' was first shown in Schmucker Gallery at [[Gettysburg College]] in 2004 as a part of Sims' ''Recoloration Proclamation: The Gettysburg Redress''. ''Recoloration Proclamation'' targets specific traditional symbols of southern heritage, which are inextricably linked to slavery and racism in America. Included in the exhibition are recolored Confederate flags, a Confederate flag hanging from the gallows, a contemporary rewrite of the [[Gettysburg Address]], contemporary recordings of the song "[[Dixie]]", and a documentary film. A notable piece featured in the exhibition ''Recoloration Proclamation: The Gettysburg Redress'' is ''ReVote,'' an installation featuring three voting booths used in Florida's disputed 2000 presidential election with re-colored Confederate flags hanging above, including black, red, and green for the [[Pan-African Flag]] of the African Liberation Movement. Pink and lavender Confederate flags with feathers and sequins were also created for the exhibition signifying "drag flags". John Sims received national media attention for his [[lynching]] of the Confederate flag.

A related exhibition, [[Dread Scott]]'s interactive installation ''What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' was first shown at [[The Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1989. Scott's piece became the center of national controversy over its use of the American flag. Dread Scott's piece begins with a photomontage of American flags draped over coffins as well as South Korean citizens burning American flags while protesting American foreign policy. The question, "What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. flag?" is written across the images. The photomontage hangs above a table where exhibit visitors are invited to write their answers to Scott's question in a blank book. A three by five foot American flag is placed on the ground in front of the table, and if visitors want to write in the book, they must first step on the flag. ''What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' joined Sims' ''The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag'' in Sarasota, Fl at the Crossley Gallery in 2006.

==Evolution of exhibitions==
[[Image:John Sims Gettysburg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.56|alt=Puzzle globe logo|Schmucker Gallery, Gettysburg]]
'''Schmucker Gallery''' Gettysburg, PA '''2004''' :The lynching exhibit was initially set to be installed outdoors in front of Schmucker Gallery at Gettysburg College, and would have remained open to the public for three weeks. [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]], Gettysburg Battlefield Preservation Association (GBPA), and other members of the community objected strongly to the exhibition. Detractors interpreted the exhibit as anti-southern heritage. Sims wrote about his motivation, "...Our sense of history is segregated, our social identity is fractured and our vocabularies for discussing race, symbols and respect are bare." Ultimately, Gettysburg College administration changed the location and duration of the exhibit. ''The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag'' was installed inside of Schmucker Gallery. John Sims boycotted the exhibition.

'''Georgia State University''' Atlanta, GA '''2005''' :
''The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag'' was shown in a group show, ''Potentially Harmful: The Art of American Censorship''. The group exhibition examines the role of artistic controversy in shaping a free society. Through two exhibitions, presentations of spoken word and performance artists, artists' talks, panel discussions, a film screening and a series of legal seminars, this project reflects an environment that nurtures contentious art. Artists included in the exhibition are [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Critical Art Ensemble]], [[Sue Coe]], [[Benita Carr]], Alex Donis, [[Karen Finley]], [[Eric Fischl]], Tom Forsythe, John Jota Leaños, Gayla Lemke, Alma Lopez, [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], Carolee Scheemann, Dread Scott, [[Andres Serrano]], Elizabeth Sisco, Louis Hock, David Avalos, John Sims, John Anthony Trobaugh, [[Pat Ward Williams]], Nancy Worthington, Marilyn Zimmerman, and The File.

'''Crossley Gallery''' Sarasota, FL '''2006''' :
''The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag'' was shown at Ringling College of Art and Design in the Crowley Gallery alongside Dread Scott's ''What is the Proper Way to Hang a U.S. Flag?'':[[File:Sims Crowley.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.56|alt=Puzzle globe logo|Crossley Gallery, Sarasota]]

'''Bowery Poetry Club''' New York, NY '''2006''' :
''Recoloration Proclamation: The New York City Hangings'' was the title of the New York City exhibition. Acclaimed controversial performance artist Karen Finley performs a piece in response to Sims' work during the exhibition. [[File:Bowery1.JPG|thumb|alt=Puzzle globe logo|Bowery Poetry Club, NYC]]

'''Brogan Museum''' Tallahassee, FL '''2007''' :
Sims' exhibition remained on display despite protests from the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who called it once again an affront to Southern heritage. The Mary Brogan Museum of Art and Science said it stands by Sims' work, which was part of a larger exhibit, ''AfroProvocations''.

'''Kennedy Museum of Art''', Ohio University, Athens OH '''2017'''
On October 26, 2017 in front of the E.W. Scripps Amphitheater at Ohio University, Sims's concept came was fully realized. "Confederate Flag: A Public Hanging" took place as originally conceived: with community participation, music, speeches and readings. The flag was ritually hung from a 13-foot gallows in a symbolic act of judgment against the history of white supremacy. Following this performance event, the flag was carried to the Kennedy Museum of Art and installed in the exhibition "Expression and Repression: Contemporary Art Censorship in America" as "The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag." The exhibition also featured Kara Walker, Sue Coe and David Wojnarowicz, and was on view through December 22, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garnett|first1=Joy|title=John Sims: "Confederate Flag: A Public Hanging" at Ohio University and the Kennedy Museum of Art|url=http://ncac.org/blog/john-sims-confederate-flag-a-public-hanging-at-the-kennedy-museum-of-art|website=NCAC.org|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6840">The '''Wolf of Zhongshan''' ({{zh|c=中山狼傳|p=Zhōngshān Láng Zhuàn}}) is a popular [[China|Chinese]] [[fairy tale]] deals with the ingratitude of a creature after being saved.  The first print of the story is found in the [[Ming Dynasty]] ''Ocean Stories of Past and Present'' ({{zh|c=海說古今|p=Hǎishuō Gǔjīn}}) published in 1544.&lt;ref name="wolf"&gt;{{cite book|title=Personal salvation and filial piety: two precious scroll narratives of Guanyin and her acolytes|author=Wilt L. Idema|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2008|ISBN=9780824832155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKimqfLnB1IC&amp;dq=Guan+Yin+Golden+youth+Jade+dragon&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The story is set during the late [[Spring and Autumn period]].  [[King Jian Zi]] (趙簡子 - BC?-BC 476) was leading a hunting party through [[Zhongshan]] when he happen to come across a [[wolf]].  King Jian takes aim with his bow and arrow but misses and hits a stone instead.  The wolf desperately flees through the forest with the hunting party in pursuit.  As the wolf makes its way through the forest he stumbles upon a traveling [[Mohist]] scholar Mr. Dongguo ({{zh|c=東郭先生|p=Dōngguō Xiānshēng}}).  The wolf appeals to the scholar's belief of "universal love" and implores for his help. Mr. Dongguo takes pity on the creature and hides it in one of his books bags strapped to his donkey.

When the hunters approach him, Mr. Dongguo denies any knowledge of the wolf's whereabouts.  After the hunters had left, Mr. Dongguo lets the wolf out of his bag, got on his donkey, and was about to take his leave only to be stopped by the wolf.  The wolf now asked the scholar to save his life again, this time from starvation.  Mr. Dongguo offered the wolf some pastries, but the wolf smile and said "I don't eat those, I dine solely on meat".  Puzzled, Mr. Dongguo inquires if the wolf intended to eat his donkey and the wolf replies "No, no, donkey meat is no good".  The donkey, upon hearing this, bolts from the scene as fast as its four legs to carry it leaving Mr. Dongguo behind with the wolf.  To Mr. Dongguo's surprise, the hungry wolf pounced on him and announced its intention to eat him.  When Mr. Dongguo protests at the wolf's ingratitude, the wolf presents the argument: since the scholar saved his life once why not do it again?  Now that it was starving, only by serving as the wolf's food will the scholar have fulfilled the act of saving his life.  Besides, the wolf complained that it nearly suffocated while it was crammed in the scholar's bag and the scholar now owed him.  Dongguo and the wolf debated and finally decided to present their case to the judgment of three elders.

The first elder they present their argument to is an old withering [[apricot]] tree.  The tree relates its own experience to the two on how when it was young, children used to pick its fruits from its branches and the tree would tell them to eat their fill.  Now it was about to be chopped down to provide firewood.  The tree sides with the wolf.  The wolf is very pleased.

The second elder they present their argument to was an elderly [[water buffalo]].  The buffalo tells its story of how it served its masters for many years dutifully providing him with milk and plowing his fields.  Now his master wants to butcher it so he can eat his meat.  The buffalo too sides with the wolf.  The wolf grins and feels even more justified in his request to eat the scholar.  Mr. Dongguo reminds the wolf that they have one more elder to seek out.

The last elder they present their argument to is an elderly farmer.  The farmer was skeptical and didn't believe that the wolf could fit into the bag.  To illustrate its point, the wolf crawled back into the bag and right away the old farmer tied up the bag and started to beat the wolf with his [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]].  The farmer bashes the wolf to an inch of his life then unties the bag and drags his dying wolf out of the bag.

Seeing the pitiful wolf the scholar thinks that the old farmer was too cruel but just then a weeping woman comes running towards them.  She pointed to the wolf and told Mr. Dongguo and the farmer how it dragged off her little boy.  Mr Dongguo now no longer pitied the wolf.  He picked up the hoe and strikes the final blow to the wolf's head.

==Author==
The authorship of this text is a matter of dispute.  The text originally appeared in the ''Hǎishuō Gǔjīn'' as an anonymous text with no author listed but it has generally been attributed to [[Ma Zhongxi]] ({{zh|c=馬中錫|p=Mǎ Zhōngxí}}) (1446–1512).  In classical Chinese literature, this tale is quite unusual in the fact that it is a fully developed animal [[fable]]. In most prose fables or poems where animals are imbued with human characteristics (e.g., ''[[Huli jing]]''), they are usually first transformed into human form before they are allowed to speak.

The term Mr. Dongguo (Dōngguō Xiānshēng) has now become a Chinese idiom for a naive person who gets into trouble through being softhearted to evil people.

==Variations==

Another variation of this tale can be found in the ''Precious Scroll of [[Sudhana|Shancai]] and [[Longnü]]''.

[[Leo Tolstoy]] in one of his "readers" for elementary school has a similar story, entitled ''The Wolf and the Farmer'' ({{lang-ru|Волк и мужик}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rvb.ru/tolstoy/01text/vol_10/01text/0212.htm Четвертая русская книга для чтения: ВОЛК И МУЖИК (Сказка)] (The Fourth Russian Reader, "The Wolf and the Farmer" (A tale)), in: Л.Н.Толстой, СОБРАНИЕ СОЧИНЕНИЙ В 22 ТОМАХ, Москва � 'Художественная литература', 1982, ТОМ ДЕСЯТЫЙ. Четвертая русская книга для чтения (L.N. Tolstoy, Collected Works in 22 volumes. Moscow, Khudozhestvennaia Literatura Publishers, 1982. Vol. 10, p. 170)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tomba della Mula''' (Italian: "Tomb of the She-Mule") is a [[beehive tomb]] in [[Sesto Fiorentino]], near [[Florence]], central [[Italy]], dating to the 7th century BC.

The names derives from an ancient legend, according to which a golden she-mule had been buried in the fields around Florence. It is known since the 15th century, and is the largest pre-[[Italic tribes|Italic]] dome tomb known in Italy. The structure has a diameter of some 9 meters. 

The tomb was declared a national monument in 1905.

The '''Vebjørn Sand da Vinci Project''' built a laminated-wood parabolic-arch pedestrian bridge in Norway over [[European route E18]] in [[Ås, Akershus|Ås]], [[Norway]], in 2001. It was a partnership between the [[Norwegian Public Roads Administration]] and Norwegian painter and artist [[Vebjørn Sand]], who headed the project. The resulting [[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci#Bridges and Hydraulics|da Vinci Bridge]] is one of several installations that Sand is known for in Norway.

==History==
===Original design===
[[Leonardo da Vinci]] proposed a bridge {{convert|366|m|abbr=on}} long, overall and {{convert|24|m|abbr=on}} wide over the [[Golden Horn]] in 1502 for [[Sultan]] [[Bayezid II]] of Constantinople (today’s [[Istanbul]]). The sketch and letter proposal were lost for over 400 years before being rediscovered in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aqMtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7HIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4408%2C3714663 |title=Da Vinci Planned Bosporus Bridge for Turks in 1503 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=AP |date=26 March 1952 |newspaper=The Day |location=New London, Connecticut |accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed bridge included a {{convert|240|m|abbr=on}} "pressed bow" main span with {{convert|43|m|abbr=on}} of vertical clearance to allow ships to pass.&lt;ref name=WSJ-20051105 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Atalay-2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/01/22/leonardos-bridge-part-2-the-bridge-for-the-sultan/ |title=LEONARDO'S BRIDGE: Part 2.

I, your subject, have determined how to build the bridge. It will be a masonry bridge as high as a building, and even tall ships will be able to sail under it."&lt;ref name=Atalay-2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leonardobridgeproject.org/leonardo-design.htm |title=Leonardo's Design |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=The Leonardo Bridge Project |accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sketch was confirmed to be a genuine work of da Vinci by comparison with an identical sketch in ''Manuscript L'', part of the [[List of works by Leonardo da Vinci#Manuscripts|''Paris Manuscripts'']] stored in the [[Institut de France]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=Atalay-2 /&gt;

Had the 1502 design been implemented, it would have been the longest bridge in the world,&lt;ref name=Guardian01 /&gt; and it would still be the [[List of longest masonry arch bridge spans|longest single masonry arch span in the world]]. Da Vinci is said to have been inspired by the then newly-built bridge "Ponte degli [[Alidosi]]" over [[Santerno]] at [[Castel del Rio]] near [[Bologna]] with a 42 m. high semicircular arch .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jUN66n1fyWcC&amp;pg=PA212#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Literary Works of Leonardo Da Vinci, Volume 1 |author=Pedretti, Carlo |date=1977 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=0-520-03329-9 |pages=212–214, note 1109 |accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwegian artist Vebjørn Sand saw da Vinci's Haliç bridge sketch in 1996 and proposed the bridge should be implemented by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA).

'''Visual Communications''' (also known as '''VC''') –– is a community-based non-profit media arts organization based in Los Angeles and founded in 1970 by independent filmmakers [[Robert Nakamura]], Alan Ohashi, Eddie Wong, and Duane Kubo. Fueled by the Civil Rights and Anti-War movements, they set out creating learning kits, photographing community events, recording oral histories, and collecting historical images of Asian American life. Additionally, they created [[films]], [[video productions]], [[community media]] productions, screening activities, and photographic exhibits and publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and History|url=http://www.vconline.org/alpha/cms/default/index.cfm/about-us/mission-history/|publisher=Visual Communications|accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VC originally worked as a film collective, concentrating on portraying accurate images of Asian Americans and capturing social movements. In the 1970s and 80s, VC took on several projects in the independent film production arena.  That first period saw the creation of over fifty productions, including works about the Asian American experience, such as: CHINATOWN 2-STEP, a documentary on the suburbanization of Chinese American community in Los Angeles and the role of the Chinatown Drum and Bugle Corps; MANONG, a film on the first generation Filipino American immigrants; and WATARIDORI, a documentary on early Japanese American immigrant pioneers. VC published three books, In Movement: A Pictorial History of Asian Pacific America, Little Tokyo: One Hundred Years in Pictures, and Moving the Image: Independent Asian Pacific American Media Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visual Communications' Profile|url=http://www.laassubject.org/index.php/directory/profile/visual_communications|publisher=LA as Subject|accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, VC transitioned from a film production collective to a media arts center. The organization provided support services like workshops and trainings for Asian American artists, filmmakers, and community members, as well as presentation opportunities for independent media. VC currently offers production and training in filmmaking, video and photography for [[Asian Americans]]. VC presents the [[Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival]] annually and maintains an archives of [[Asian Pacific American]] still and moving image holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Visual Communications, About Us, Mission &amp; History, http://www.vconline.org/alpha/cms/default/index.cfm/about-us/mission-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
To promote intercultural understanding through the creation, presentation, preservation and support of media works by and about Asian Pacific Americans.  VC was created with the understanding that media and the arts are important vehicles to organize and empower communities, build connections between generations, challenge perspectives, and create an environment for critical thinking, necessary to build a more just and humane society.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Vitruvian Man''''' ({{lang-it|'''Le proporzioni del corpo umano secondo Vitruvio'''}}, which is translated to "The proportions of the human body according to Vitruvius"), or simply '''''L'Uomo Vitruviano''''' ({{IPA-it|ˈlwɔːmo vitruˈvjaːno}}), is a [[drawing]] made by the Italian polymath [[Leonardo da Vinci]] around 1490.&lt;ref&gt;The Secret Language of the Renaissance – Richard Stemp&lt;/ref&gt; It is accompanied by notes based on the work of the architect [[Vitruvius]]. The drawing, which is in ink on paper, depicts a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and inscribed in a circle and square. The drawing and text are sometimes called the ''Canon of Proportions'' or, less often, ''Proportions of Man''. It is kept in the Gabinetto dei disegni e stampe of the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], under reference 228. Like most works on paper, it is displayed to the public only occasionally, so it is not part of the normal exhibition of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leonardodavinci.stanford.edu/submissions/clabaugh/history/leonardo.html |title=The Vitruvian man |publisher=Leonardodavinci.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://witcombe.sbc.edu/davincicode/leonardo-vitruvian-man.html |title=Da Vinci's Code |publisher=Witcombe.sbc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drawing is based on the correlations of ideal human [[body proportions]] with geometry described by the ancient Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] in Book III of his treatise ''[[De architectura]]''. Vitruvius described the human figure as being the principal source of proportion among the [[classical order]]s of architecture. Vitruvius determined that the ideal body should be eight heads high. Leonardo's drawing is traditionally named in honor of the architect.

==Subject and title==
This image demonstrates the blend of [[mathematics and art]] during the [[Renaissance]] and demonstrates Leonardo's deep understanding of [[body proportions|proportion]]. In addition, this picture represents a cornerstone of Leonardo's attempts to relate man to nature. [[Encyclopædia Britannica|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' online]] states, "Leonardo envisaged the great picture chart of the human body he had produced through his anatomical drawings and ''Vitruvian Man'' as a ''cosmografia del minor mondo'' ([[cosmography]] of the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]). He believed the workings of the human body to be an analogy for the workings of the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci/Anatomical-studies-and-drawings|title=Leonardo da Vinci|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.|first=Ludwig Heinrich|last=Heydenreich|date=2017-04-30|accessdate=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Leonardo's preview in the accompanying text, written in [[mirror writing]], it was made as a study of the proportions of the (male) human body as described in [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura]]'' 3.1.2–3, which reads:
{{quote|For the human body is so designed by nature that the face, from the chin to the top of the forehead and the lowest roots of the hair, is a tenth part of the whole height; the open hand from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger is just the same; the head from the chin to the crown is an eighth, and with the neck and shoulder from the top of the breast to the lowest roots of the hair is a sixth; from the middle of the breast to the summit of the crown is a fourth. If we take the height of the face itself, the distance from the bottom of the chin to the under side of the nostrils is one third of it; the nose from the under side of the nostrils to a line between the eyebrows is the same; from there to the lowest roots of the hair is also a third, comprising the forehead. The length of the foot is one sixth of the height of the body; of the forearm, one fourth; and the breadth of the breast is also one fourth. The other members, too, have their own symmetrical proportions, and it was by employing them that the famous painters and sculptors of antiquity attained to great and endless renown.

Similarly, in the members of a temple there ought to be the greatest harmony in the symmetrical relations of the different parts to the general magnitude of the whole. Then again, in the human body the central point is naturally the navel. For if a man be placed flat on his back, with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centred at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom. And just as the human body yields a circular outline, so too a square figure may be found from it. For if we measure the distance from the soles of the feet to the top of the head, and then apply that measure to the outstretched arms, the breadth will be found to be the same as the height, as in the case of plane surfaces which are perfectly square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20239/20239-h/29239-h.htm#Page_72 |title=Ten Books on Architecture. Book III, Chapter I, "On Symmetry: In Temples And In The Human Body" |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2006-12-31 |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Leonardo's drawing combines a careful reading of the ancient text with his own observation of actual human bodies. In drawing the circle and square he observes that the square cannot have the same centre as the circle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.about.com/library/weekly/bl_leo_vitruvian_man.htm|title=The Vitruvian Man - Leonardo Da Vinci|website=About.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412011914/http://arthistory.about.com/library/weekly/bl_leo_vitruvian_man.htm|archivedate=12 April 2014|accessdate=20 November 2018|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is centered at the groin.&lt;ref name=secrets&gt;{{cite episode|title=Leonardo: The Man Who Saved Science|series=[[Secrets of the Dead]]|network=PBS|date=5 April 2017|season=16|number=5|minutes=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adjustment is the innovative part of Leonardo's drawing and what distinguishes it from earlier illustrations. He also departs from Vitruvius by drawing the arms raised to a position in which the fingertips are level with the top of the head, rather than Vitruvius's much lower angle, in which the arms form lines passing through the navel.

The drawing itself is often used as an implied symbol of the essential [[Bilateria|symmetry of the human body]], and by extension, the symmetry of the [[universe]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewholeuniversebook.com/2/page2.html |title=Bibliographic reference|publisher=The Whole Universe Book|date=|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be noticed by examining the drawing that the combination of arm and leg positions creates sixteen different poses. The pose with the arms straight out and the feet together is seen to be inscribed in the superimposed square. On the other hand, the "spread-eagle" pose is seen to be inscribed in the superimposed circle.

The drawing was purchased from Gaudenzio de' Pagave by [[Giuseppe Bossi]],&lt;ref name=bossi&gt;Bossi, Giuseppe (1810)[https://books.google.com/books?id=F8IhAQAAMAAJ ''Del Cenacolo di Leonardo da Vinci libri quattro''] (in Italian) Milano: Stamperia Reale p.208''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; who described, discussed and illustrated it in his monograph on Leonardo's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'', ''Del Cenacolo di Leonardo da Vinci libri quattro'' (1810).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ursusbooks.com/item94345.html |title=Bibliographic reference |publisher=Ursusbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he excerpted the section of his monograph concerned with the ''Vitruvian Man'' and published it as ''Delle opinioni di Leonardo da Vinci intorno alla simmetria de'Corpi Umani'' (1811), with a dedication to his friend [[Antonio Canova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=3459 |title=Bibliographical notice, no. 319 |publisher=Lib.rochester.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107113208/http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=3459 |archivedate=7 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bossi's death in 1815 the ''Vitruvian Man'' was acquired in 1822, along with a number of his drawings, by the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice, Italy, and has remained there since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.venezia.net/12/09/2013/venice-accademia-gallery-leonardo-da-vinci-universal-man.html |title=LEONARDO DA VINCI.

[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s collaboration with the author of ''[[De divina proportione]]'' (''On the Divine Proportion'')&lt;ref&gt;''Leonardo da Vinci's Polyhedra'', by [[George W. Hart]][http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/leonardo.html]&lt;/ref&gt; have led some to speculate that he incorporated the [[golden ratio]] in ''Vitruvian Man'', but this is not supported by any of Leonardo's writings.&lt;ref name=livio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plus.maths.org/content/os/issue22/features/golden/index|title=The golden ratio and aesthetics|last=Livio|first=Mario|date=November 1, 2002|website=Plus Magazine|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Keith Devlin|url=http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_05_07.html|title=The Myth That Will Not Go Away|date=May 2007|quote=Part of the process of becoming a mathematics writer is, it appears, learning that you cannot refer to the golden ratio without following the first mention by a phrase that goes something like 'which the ancient Greeks and others believed to have divine and mystical properties.' Almost as compulsive is the urge to add a second factoid along the lines of 'Leonardo Da Vinci believed that the human form displays the golden ratio.' There is not a shred of evidence to back up either claim, and every reason to assume they are both false. Yet both claims, along with various others in a similar vein, live on.|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportions of ''Vitruvian Man'' do not match the golden ratio precisely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Donald E.

==Evidence of collaboration==
Many artists attempted to design figures which would satisfy Vitruvius' claim that a human could fit into both a circle and a square.&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46204318/ns/technology_and_science-science/|title=Did Leonardo da Vinci copy his famous 'Vitruvian Man'?|last=Wolchover|first=Natalie|date=31 January 2012|website=NBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319004214/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46204318/ns/technology_and_science-science/|archivedate=19 March 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smiths&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/The-Other-Vitruvian-Man.html?c=y&amp;story=fullstory|title=The Other Vitruvian Man|last=Lester|first=Toby|publisher=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]|date=1 February 2012|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo may have been influenced by the work of his friend [[Iacomo Andrea|Giacomo Andrea de Ferrara]], a Renaissance architect and an expert on Vitruvius. Andrea's drawing features erasure marks indicating its unique creation.&lt;ref name=smiths/&gt;&lt;ref name=secrets/&gt; As with Leonardo's ''Vitruvian Man'', Andrea's circle is centered on the naval, but only one pose is included. Leonardo's design includes two sets of arms and legs to touch both the circle and the square.&lt;ref name=secrets/&gt;

==Translation of the text==
The text is in two parts, above&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=sopra/&gt; and below&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=sotto/&gt; the image. The upper part paraphrases Vitruvius:
{{quote|Vetruvio, architect, puts in his work on architecture that the measurements of man are in nature distributed in this manner: that is a [[palm (unit)|palm]] is four fingers, a [[foot (unit)|foot]] is four palms, a [[cubit]] is six palms, four cubits make a man, a [[Pace (unit of length)|pace]] is four cubits, a man is 24 palms and these measurements are in his buildings.

If you open your legs enough that your head is lowered by one-fourteenth of your height and raise your hands enough that your extended fingers touch the line of the top of your head, know that the centre of the extended limbs will be the navel, and the space between the legs will be an equilateral triangle.}}

The lower section of text gives these proportions:
{{quote|The length of the outspread arms is equal to the height of a man; from the hairline to the bottom of the chin is one-tenth of the height of a man; from below the chin to the top of the head is one-eighth of the height of a man; from above the chest to the top of the head is one-sixth of the height of a man; from above the chest to the hairline is one-seventh of the height of a man. The maximum width of the shoulders is a quarter of the height of a man; from the breasts to the top of the head is a quarter of the height of a man; the distance from the elbow to the tip of the hand is a quarter of the height of a man; the distance from the elbow to the armpit is one-eighth of the height of a man; the length of the hand is one-tenth of the height of a man; the root of the penis is at half the height of a man; the foot is one-seventh of the height of a man; from below the foot to below the knee is a quarter of the height of a man; from below the knee to the root of the penis is a quarter of the height of a man; the distances from below the chin to the nose and the eyebrows and the hairline are equal to the ears and to one-third of the face.}}

The points determining these proportions are marked with lines on the drawing. Below the drawing is a single line equal to a side of the square and divided into four cubits, of which the outer two are divided into six palms each, two of which have the mirror-text annotation "palmi"; the outermost two palms are divided into four fingers each, and are each annotated "diti".

==Legacy==
''Vitruvian Man'' has stimulated artists including:

* [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1528)
* [[Pietro di Giacomo Cataneo]] (1554)
* [[Heinrich Lautensack]] (1618)
