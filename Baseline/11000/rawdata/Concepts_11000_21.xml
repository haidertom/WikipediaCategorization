An '''altered level of consciousness''' is any measure of [[arousal]] other than normal.  '''Level of consciousness''' ('''LOC''') is a measurement of a person's arousability and responsiveness to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] from the environment.&lt;ref name="Kandel00"&gt;
{{cite book |author =Kandel ER |author2=Jessell, Thomas M. |author3 = Schwartz, James H. |title=Principles of neural science |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=901 |isbn=0-8385-7701-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-07-03 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=yzEFK7Xc87YC&amp;pg=PA901&amp;dq=%22level+of+consciousness%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A mildly depressed level of [[consciousness]] or [[alertness]] may be classed as [[lethargy]]; someone in this state can be aroused with little difficulty.&lt;ref name="Kandel00"/&gt;  People who are [[Obtundation|obtunded]] have a more depressed level of consciousness and cannot be fully aroused.&lt;ref name="Kandel00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Porth07"/&gt;  Those who are not able to be aroused from a sleep-like state are said to be [[stupor]]ous.&lt;ref name="Kandel00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Porth07"/&gt; [[Coma]] is the inability to make any purposeful response.&lt;ref name="Kandel00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Porth07"/&gt;   Scales such as the [[Glasgow coma scale]] have been designed to measure the level of consciousness.

An altered level of consciousness can result from a variety of factors, including alterations in the chemical environment of the brain (e.g. exposure to [[poison]]s or [[intoxicant]]s), insufficient [[oxygen]] or [[blood flow]] in the brain, and excessive [[intracranial pressure|pressure within the skull]]. &lt;!--Level of consciousness may decline abruptly or slowly, or it may increase and decrease intermittently.&lt;ref name="Dohert05"/&gt;--&gt; Prolonged unconsciousness is understood to be a sign of a [[medical emergency]].&lt;ref name="Pollak02"/&gt;  A deficit in the level of consciousness suggests that both of the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s or the [[reticular activating system]] have been injured.&lt;ref name="Porth071"&gt;Porth, p. 838&lt;/ref&gt;  A decreased level of consciousness correlates to increased [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] (sickness) and [[mortality rate|mortality]] (death).&lt;ref name="Scheld041"&gt;Scheld ''et al.''. p. 530&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is a valuable measure of a patient's medical and neurological status. In fact, some sources consider level of consciousness to be one of the [[vital sign]]s.&lt;ref name="Pollak02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forgey99"&gt;

==Definition==
Scales and terms to classify the levels of consciousness differ, but in general, reduction in response to stimuli indicates an altered level of consciousness:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ '''Levels of consciousness'''
! Level !! Summary (Kruse)&lt;ref name="Porth07"/&gt; !! Description
|-
! [[Metacognition|Metaconscious]]
| Preternatural
| People who possess the ability to monitor and control their own cognitive processes in addition to meeting all the criteria indicative of a normal level of consciousness. In the field of [[cognitive neuroscience]], metacognitive monitoring and control have been viewed as functions of the [[prefrontal cortex]], which receives sensory input signals from divergent cortical regions and implements control through feedback loops which are established utilizing the underlying mechanisms of [[neuroplasticity]] (see chapters by Schwartz &amp; Bacon and Shimamura, in Dunlosky &amp; Bjork, 2008).&lt;ref name="Dunlosky"&gt;Dunlosky, J. &amp; Bjork, R. A. (Eds), Handbook of Metamemory and Memory. Psychology Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
! [[Conscious]]
| Normal
| Assessment of LOC involves checking [[Orientation (mental)|orientation]]: people who are able promptly and spontaneously to state their name, location, and the date or time are said to be oriented to self, place, and time, or "oriented X3".&lt;ref name="Kruse86"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  A normal [[sleep]] stage from which a person is easily awakened is also considered a normal level of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt; "Clouding of consciousness" is a term for a mild alteration of consciousness with alterations in attention and wakefulness.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;
|-
! [[Confused]]
|Disoriented; impaired thinking and responses
| People who do not respond quickly with information about their name, location, and the time are considered "obtuse" or "[[confusion|confused]]".&lt;ref name="Kruse86"/&gt;  A confused person may be bewildered, disoriented, and have difficulty following instructions.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;  The person may have slow thinking and possible memory time loss.  This could be caused by sleep deprivation, malnutrition, allergies, environmental pollution, drugs (prescription and nonprescription), and infection.
|-
![[Delirium|Delirious]]
|Disoriented; restlessness, hallucinations, sometimes delusions
|Some scales have "delirious" below this level, in which a person may be restless or agitated and exhibit a marked deficit in [[attention]].&lt;ref name="Porth07"/&gt;
|-
![[somnolence|Somnolent]]
| Sleepy
| A ''[[somnolence|somnolent]]''&lt;!--obtunded--&gt; person shows excessive [[drowsiness]] and responds to stimuli only with incoherent mumbles or disorganized movements.&lt;ref name="Kruse86"/&gt;
|-
![[Obtundation|Obtunded]]
|Decreased alertness; slowed psychomotor responses
| In ''[[obtundation]]'', a person has a decreased interest in their surroundings, slowed responses, and sleepiness.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;
|-
![[Stuporous]]
| Sleep-like state (not unconscious); little/no spontaneous activity
|People with an even lower level of consciousness, stupor, only respond by [[Facial expression|grimacing]] or drawing away from painful stimuli.&lt;ref name="Kruse86"/&gt; 
|-
![[Coma]]tose
| Cannot be aroused; no response to stimuli
| Comatose people do not even make this response to stimuli, have no [[corneal reflex|corneal]] or [[gag reflex]], and they may have no [[pupillary response]] to light.&lt;ref name="Kruse86"/&gt;
|}

Altered level of consciousness is sometimes described as altered [[sensorium]].

===Glasgow Coma Scale===
{{Main|Glasgow Coma Scale}}
The most commonly used tool for measuring LOC objectively is the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] (GCS).  It has come into almost universal use for assessing people with [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]],&lt;ref name="Porth07"&gt;{{cite book |author =Porth C |title=Essentials of Pahtophysiology: Concepts of Altered Health States |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2007 |pages=835 |isbn=0-7817-7087-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-07-03 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=57RQC-3OPtUC&amp;pg=PT858&amp;dq=%22level+of+consciousness%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an altered level of consciousness. Verbal, motor, and eye-opening responses to stimuli are measured, scored, and added into a final score on a scale of 3–15, with a lower score being a more decreased level of consciousness.

===Others===
The [[AVPU]] scale is another means of measuring LOC: people are assessed to determine whether they are '''a'''lert, responsive to '''v'''erbal stimuli, responsive to '''p'''ainful stimuli, or '''u'''nresponsive.&lt;ref name="Pollak02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forgey99"/&gt;  To determine responsiveness to voice, a caregiver speaks to, or, failing that, yells at the person.&lt;ref name="Pollak02"/&gt;  Responsiveness to pain is determined with a mild painful stimulus such as a pinch; moaning or withdrawal from the stimulus is considered a response to pain.&lt;ref name="Pollak02"/&gt;  The ACDU scale, like AVPU, is easier to use than the GCS and produces similarly accurate results.&lt;ref name="Posner07"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors = Posner JB, Saper CB, Schiff ND, Plum F |title=Plum and Posner's Diagnosis of Stupor and Coma |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=2007 |pages=41 |isbn=0-19-532131-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using ACDU, a patient is assessed for '''a'''lertness, '''c'''onfusion, '''d'''rowsiness, and '''u'''nresponsiveness.&lt;ref name="Posner07"/&gt;

The [[Grady Coma Scale]] classes people on a scale of I to V along a scale of confusion, stupor, deep stupor, [[abnormal posturing]], and coma.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Although the neural science behind alertness, wakefulness, and arousal are not fully known, the [[reticular formation]] is known to play a role in these.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;  The [[ascending reticular activating system]] is a postulated group of neural connections that receives sensory input and projects to the [[cerebral cortex]] through the [[midbrain]] and [[thalamus]] from the retucular formation.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt; Since this system is thought to modulate wakefulness and sleep, interference with it, such as injury, illness, or metabolic disturbances, could alter the level of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;

Normally, stupor and coma are produced by interference with the [[brain stem]], such as can be caused by a [[lesion]] or indirect effects, such as [[brain herniation]].&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;  Mass lesions in the brain stem normally cause coma due to their effects on the reticular formation.&lt;ref name="Tindall901"&gt;
{{

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Mass [[lesion]]s that occur [[supratentorial|above]] the [[tentorium cerebelli]] (pictured) normally do not significantly alter the level of consciousness unless they are very large or affect both [[cerebral hemisphere]]s.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;

==Diagnostic approach==
Assessing LOC involves determining an individual's response to external stimuli.&lt;ref name="Dohert05"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Speed and accuracy of responses to questions and reactions to stimuli such as touch and pain are noted.&lt;ref name="Dohert05"/&gt; [[Reflex]]es, such as the [[coughing|cough]] and gag reflexes, are also means of judging LOC.&lt;ref name="Dohert05"/&gt;  Once the level of consciousness is determined, clinicians seek clues for the cause of any alteration.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt; Usually the first tests in the ER are pulse oximetry to determine if there is hypoxia, serum glucose levels to rule out hypoglycemia. A urine drug screen may be sent. A CT head is very important to obtain to rule out bleed. In cases where meningitis is suspected, a lumbar puncture must be performed. A serum TSH is an important test to order. In select groups consider vitamin B12 levels. Checking serum ammonia is not advised.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
===Differential diagnosis===
A lowered level of consciousness indicate a deficit in brain function.&lt;ref name="Porth071" /&gt;  Level of consciousness can be lowered when the brain receives insufficient oxygen (as occurs in [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]); insufficient blood (as occurs in [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]); or has an alteration in the [[brain chemistry|brain's chemistry]].&lt;ref name="Pollak02"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors = Pollak AN, Gupton CL |title=Emergency Care and Transportation of the Sick and Injured |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |location=Boston |year=2002 |pages=140 |isbn=0-7637-1666-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-07-04 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xAPuKkKA6FEC&amp;pg=PT177&amp;dq=%22level+of+consciousness%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metabolic disorder]]s such as [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[uremia]] can alter consciousness.&lt;ref name="Dohert05"/&gt; [[hyponatremia|Hypo-]] or [[hypernatremia]] (decreased and elevated levels of [[sodium]], respectively) as well as [[dehydration]] can also produce an altered LOC.&lt;ref name="Johnson98"&gt;

Increases in [[intracranial pressure]] (the pressure within the skull) can also cause altered LOC.  It can result from [[traumatic brain injury]] such as [[concussion]].&lt;ref name="Dohert05"/&gt;   [[Stroke]] and [[intracranial hemorrhage]] are other causes.&lt;ref name="Dohert05"/&gt; [[Infection]]s of the [[central nervous system]] may also be associated with decreased LOC; for example, an altered LOC is the most common symptom of [[encephalitis]].&lt;ref name="Scheld04"&gt;

A [[concussion]], which is a mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) may result in decreased LOC.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the degree of decrease in consciousness and its underlying cause.  Initial treatment often involves the administration of [[dextrose]] if the blood sugar is low as well as the administration of [[oxygen]], [[naloxone]] and [[thiamine]].

|}

The '''Aresti Catalog''' is the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) [[International standard|standards document]] enumerating the [[aerobatic maneuvers|aerobatic manoeuvers]] permitted in [[Competition aerobatics|aerobatic competition]]. Designed by [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[aviator]] Colonel [[José Luis Aresti Aguirre]] (1919–2003), each figure in the catalog is represented by lines, arrows, geometric shapes and numbers representing the precise form of a manoeuver to be flown.

The catalog broadly classifies manoeuvers into numbered families.  Families 1 through 8 depict basic figures, such as turns, loops and vertical lines; family 9 depicts rotational elements that can be added to basic figures to increase difficulty, change the direction of flight or invert the g-loading of the aircraft.

==Notation==
In Aresti notation, solid lines represent upright or positive-g manoeuvers and dashed lines represent inverted or negative-g manoeuvers; these are sometimes depicted in red. Thick dot represents the beginning of the manoeuver, while a short perpendicular line represents the end. Stalled wing manoeuvers such as [[spin (flight)|spin]]s and snap (flick) rolls are represented by triangles. Arrows represent rolling manoeuvers with numbers representing the extent and number of segments of the roll.

The catalog assigns each manoeuver a [[unique identifier]], called a ''catalog number'', and difficulty factor, represented by the symbol ''K''. When a basic figure is combined with one or more rolling elements, the resultant figure ''K'' is the sum of all component ''K''s.  During an aerobatics competition, judges grade the execution of each manoeuver with a value between 10 (perfect) and 0 (highly flawed). Each figure's grades are multiplied by its ''K'' and summed to yield a total raw score for the flight.

Notational systems for aerobatic manoeuvers have been used since the 1920s.&lt;ref name="BA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Szurovy|first=Geza|author2=Mike Goulian|title=Basic Aerobatics|editor=Bob Ostrander and Norval G.

The first system accepted worldwide was published by [[French people|French]] aviator François d'Huc Dressler in 1955 and 1956.  It was used for international competitions through 1962.&lt;ref name=WAChist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wac2009.com/history.html|title=History of WAC|publisher=Flying Aces Ltd.|accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

José Aresti's development of a notation for aerobatic figures began while serving as an instructor in the Jerez Pilot Training School in the 1940s.  By the end of 1961 Aresti published a dictionary of some 3,000 aerobatic manoeuvers, the ''Sistema Aerocryptographica Aresti''.  Then employed throughout Spain, the Spanish Aero Club urged its adoption internationally.  The FAI's Aerobatics Commission, [http://www.fai.org/aerobatics CIVA], elected to use the catalog beginning at the World Aerobatic Championships held in [[Bilbao, Spain]] in 1964; it has been in use worldwide and evolved continually since then.  Though the catalog had grown at one time to some 15,000 manoeuvers, a CIVA working group substantially streamlined it in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=WAChist/&gt;&lt;ref name="JAobit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iac.org/news/2003%20-%2011_20%20-%20Aerobatic%20Community%20Mourns%20Loss%20of%20Jose%20Aresti.html|title=Aerobatic community mourns loss of José Aresti|publisher=International Aerobatic Club|date=November 2003|accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Aresti's death, a court fight ensued between his heirs and FAI, which once provided a free catalog online.  The catalog is now only available in printed form for a fee from [https://web.archive.org/web/20090628093726/http://www.arestisystem.com/english/catalogue/ Aresti System S.L.]

'''Autoclitics''' are verbal responses that modify the effect on the listener of the primary operants that comprise [[B.F. Skinner]]'s classification of [[Verbal Behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1957). ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autoclitics==
An autoclitic is a verbal behavior that modifies the functions of other verbal behaviors. For example, "I think it is raining" possesses the autoclitic "I think," which moderates the strength of the statement "it is raining." Research that involves autoclitics includes Lodhi &amp; Greer (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lodhi |first=S. |last2=Greer |first2=R.D. |year=1989 |title=The speaker as listener |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=51 |pages=353–359 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1989.51-353 |pmid=16812582 |issue=3 |pmc=1338927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive autoclitics===
A speaker may acquire verbal behavior that describes their own behavior. "I said Noam C. Hayes is wrong" is a descriptive autoclitic that describes the behavior of talking about one's own behavior. They may also describe strength of response, as the emission of "I think" is often used to indicate some level of weakness, as in "Noam Chomsky is smart, I think." Descriptive autoclitics modify the listener's reaction by specifying something about the circumstances of the emission of a response or the condition of the speaker providing the verbal response. For example, the "I guess" in "I guess he is here" describes strength of the statement "he is here." It does so because "I guess" specifies that the speaker is not sure he is here, just guessing, thus showing weakness in the strength of the response "he is here." In describing something about a response, descriptive autoclitics specify some condition of a response, such as "I said" in "I said 'Hello.{{'"}} The "I said" describes the condition under which "Hello" was said. Descriptive autoclitics can include information regarding the type of verbal operant it accompanies, the strength of the verbal response, the relation between responses, or the emotional or motivation conditions of the speaker. In addition, negative autoclitics quantify or cancel the responses they accompany. For example, the ''not'' in "it is not raining" cancels the response "it is raining." Descriptive autoclitics can also just indicate a response is being emitted, or that the emitted response is subordinate in relation to what has been said, e.g., "for example." Qualifying autoclitics modify the listener's behavior in their qualification of [[Tact (psychology)|tacts]] in its intensity or direction. Negation is a common qualifying autoclitic, as in "it is not raining", the ''not'' qualifies it is raining. Without the ''not'', the listener's behavior would be inappropriate. "No!" also serves to cancel a response, while "Yes!" encourages a response, as qualifying autoclitics can serve to assert a response.

Quantifying autoclitics modify the reaction of the listener, in that ''all'', ''some'', and ''no'' affect the responses they accompany. ''A'' and ''the'' narrow a listener in on the response that follows and its relation to the controlling stimulus. For example, circumstances under which we say "book" vary from those where we say "the book," with ''the'' functioning to modify the listener's reaction. Relational autoclitics are different from descriptive autoclitics in that they affect the behavior of the listener. For example, ''above'' in "the book is above the shelf" tells the listener where to find the book, thereby altering where the listener looks for the book. Another way to look at relational autoclitics is that they describe the relation between verbal operants, and modify the listener's behavior in that way.  For example, in the statement "the book is black" the ''is'' tells the listener there is a relation between book and black, ''is'' specifies what is black.

===Grammar and syntax as autoclitic processes===
Skinner describes grammatical manipulations, such as the order or grouping of responses, as autoclitic. The ordering of patterns may be a function of relevant strength, temporal ordering, or other factors. Skinner speaks to the use of predication and the use of tags, contrasting the Latin forms, which use tags—and English, which uses grouping and ordering. Skinner proposes the relational autoclitic as a descriptor for these kinds of relationships.

===Composition and its effect===
Composition represents a special class of autoclitic responding, because the responding is itself a response to previously existing verbal responses. The autoclitic is controlled not only by the effects on the listener but upon the speaker as listener of their own responses. Skinner notes that "emotional and imaginal" behavior has little to do with grammar and syntax. Obscene words and poetry are likely to be effective, even when emitted non-grammatically.

===Self-editing===
Self-editing as a compositional process follows the autoclitic process of manipulating responses. After the responses are changed with autoclitics they are examined for their effects and then "rejected or released." Conditions may prevent self-editing, such as a very high response strength. 

===Rejection===
The physical topography of the rejection of verbal behavior in the process of editing varies from the partial emission of a written word to the apparent non-emission of a vocal response. It may include ensuring that responses simply do not reach a listener, as in not delivering a manuscript or letter. Manipulative autoclitics can revoke words by striking them out, as in a court of law. Similar effects may arise from expression like "Forget it."

===Defective feedback===
A speaker may fail to react as a listener to their own speech under conditions where the emission of verbal responses is very quick. The speed may be a function of strength or of differential reinforcement. Physical interruption may arise as in the case of those who are hearing impaired, or under conditions of mechanical impairment such as ambient noise. Skinner argues{{fact|date=September 2017}} the Ouija board may operate to mask feedback and so produce unedited verbal behavior.

'''Behavioral engineering''' is intended to identify issues associated with the interface of [[technology]] and the human operators in a system and to generate recommended design practices that consider the strengths and limitations of the human operators.
{{quote|"The behavior of the individual has been shaped according to revelations of 'good conduct' never as the result of experimental study."|[[B.F Skinner]]|''"[[Walden Two]]"''}}

Watson wrote in 1924 "Behaviorism ... holds that the subject matter of human psychology is the behavior of the human being. Behaviorism claims that consciousness is neither a definite nor a usable concept."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J.B. (1924) ''Behaviorism''&lt;/ref&gt; 

This approach is often used in organizational behavior management, which is [[behavior analysis]] applied to organizations and behavioral community psychology.

As a rookie, he played mostly special teams for the Packers in [[1961 Green Bay Packers season|1961]], who beat the Giants 37–0 in the [[1961 NFL Championship Game|championship game]], the first of five NFL titles for head coach [[Vince Lombardi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-videos/09000d5d8060ece8/1961-NFL-Championship-Game 1961 NFL Championship Game at NFL.Com]&lt;/ref&gt; During training camp in 1962, Davidson was traded to the [[1962 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] for a fifth round draft choice.&lt;ref name=dttred62&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ysEVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1hAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6889%2C1177522 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |last=Lea |first=Bud |title=Davidson traded to Redskins |date=August 21, 1962 |page=2, part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played there in [[1962 Washington Redskins season|1962]] and [[1963 Washington Redskins season|1963]], until he was waived in September [[1964 Washington Redskins season|1964]] final cuts after not meeting the team's strict weight guidelines.&lt;ref name=dbsltgl/&gt;&lt;ref name=ppbfoc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jNhaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hWwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5196%2C1765022 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |agency=Associated  |title=Barnes, five other cut by Redskins |date=September 10, 1964 |page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AFL===
Davidson is best remembered his play with the [[American Football League]] [[Oakland Raiders]].  [[Al Davis]] signed him as a free agent shortly after his release from the Redskins and he thrived as a pass rusher under head coaches Davis, [[John Rauch]], and [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]]. Davidson played in Oakland from [[1964 Oakland Raiders season|1964]] through [[1972 Oakland Raiders season|1972]], and was part of the [[AFL–NFL merger|league merger]] in {{nfly|1970}}. He was an [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star]] in 1966, 1967, and 1968.

The Raiders won the [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|AFL championship]] in [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|1967]] and played in [[Super Bowl II]], but were overmatched by the [[1967 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]. Oakland advanced to the AFL title games the next two seasons but lost to the [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in [[1968 American Football League Championship Game|1968]] and the [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] in [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|1969]], the league's last game. A stretched [[Achilles tendon]] in 1972 kept him on the sidelines that entire season.&lt;ref name=dsbhim&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r6dYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l_gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3217%2C1680242 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Davidson style belies his image |date=February 6, 1973 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dawson-Taylor incident====
On November 1, [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|1970]], the [[Super Bowl IV|defending world champion]] [[1970 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] led the Raiders 17–14 late in the fourth quarter, and a long run for a first-down by Chiefs quarterback [[Len Dawson]] apparently sealed victory for the Chiefs in the final minute when Dawson, as he lay on the ground, was speared by Davidson, who dove into Dawson with his helmet, provoking Chiefs' receiver [[Otis Taylor (American football)|Otis Taylor]] to attack Davidson. After a bench-clearing brawl, offsetting penalties were called, nullifying the first down under the rules in effect at that time. The Chiefs were obliged to punt, and the Raiders tied the game on a [[George Blanda]] field goal with eight seconds to play. Davidson's play not only cost the Chiefs a win, but Oakland won the [[AFC West]] with a season record of 8–4–2, while Kansas City finished 7–5–2 and out of the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ KC Chiefs website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609052751/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ |date=2008-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DtchMastr |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SdzXsUJF98#t=35s |title="Big" Ben Davidson - Oakland Raiders |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, the NFL changed its rules regarding personal fouls, separating those called during a play from those called after it.

===WFL===
Three years out of football, Davidson signed with the [[Portland Storm#1974 regular season|Portland Storm]] in early September 1974, already midway through the [[World Football League]]'s inaugural [[1974 World Football League season|1974]] season.&lt;ref name=dssct&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bDRWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4ucDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1274%2C818676 |newspaper=Eugene Register Guard |location=Oregon |title=Davidson signs Storm contract |date=September 4, 1974 |page=1B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbrrst&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bzRWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4ucDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1733%2C1707243|newspaper=Eugene Register Guard |location=Oregon |last=Cawood |first=Neil |title=Big Ben, Roadrunner stir the Storm, 15-8 |date=September 7, 1974 |page=1B }}&lt;/ref&gt; While with the Storm, he lived in his motor home that he drove up from California.&lt;ref name=dshhlsd/&gt; A late season knee injury in early November ended his season and playing career.&lt;ref name=swhtmi&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AJ8gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jGgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1020%2C1655789 |newspaper=Lewiston Evening Journal |location=Maine |title=Storm will have to make it without Ben Davidson |date=November 9, 1974 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment career==
Davidson appeared in a few films including ''[[The Black Six]]'', ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H]]'', and ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''. He portrayed Porter the Bouncer in ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'' in [[1972 in film|1972]] and a convict football player in ''[[Necessary Roughness (film)|Necessary Roughness]]'' in [[1991 in film|1991]].  Davidson played himself in [[Miller Lite]] ads featuring [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]] and [[Rodney Dangerfield]]. He also appeared in the short lived 1976 show ''[[Ball Four (TV series)|Ball Four]]'', the 1977 pilot for ''[[Lucan (TV series)|Lucan]]'' and the 1984 TV series Goldie and the Bears. Davidson also appeared in an episode of the 1970's TV series [[Happy Days]] as a lumberjack.

==Personal life==
Following his rookie season with Green Bay, Davidson took his winner's check ($5,195) from the 1961 NFL title game and bought rental property in San Diego.&lt;ref name=dbsltgl/&gt; He began 1961 with a [[1961 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] win on January 2 and ended it with an NFL championship on December 31, and was married in between.&lt;ref name=dbsltgl/&gt;

Davidson and fellow Oakland Raider teammate [[Tom Keating (American football)|Tom Keating]] were avid motorcycle riders and completed both a ride from California to the [[Panama Canal]] and a four-month, {{convert|14000|mi|adj=on}} trip across the United States while with the Raiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/25/sports/la-sp-crowe-20100726 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Jerry | last=Crowe | title=For Ben Davidson, the quintessential Raider, football was the ticket to a great life | date=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson died of [[prostate cancer]] at age 72.&lt;ref name=nytob/&gt;&lt;ref name=latob/&gt;  He was retired and living in San Diego and was survived by his wife Kathy, and daughters Janella, Dana, and Vicki.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Borderline personality disorder''' ('''BPD'''), also known as '''emotionally unstable personality disorder''' ('''EUPD'''),&lt;ref name=NICEGuidelines2009&gt;{{cite book|title=Borderline personality disorder NICE Clinical Guidelines, No. 78|date=2009|publisher=British Psychological Society|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK55415/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by unstable [[interpersonal relationships|relationships with other people]], unstable [[self-image|sense of self]] and unstable [[affect (psychology)|emotions]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; There is often dangerous behavior and [[self-harm]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; People may also struggle with a feeling of emptiness and a fear of [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Symptoms may be brought on by seemingly normal events.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; The behavior typically begins by early adulthood and occurs across a variety of situations.&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Washington [etc.]|isbn=9780890425558|pages=645, 663–6|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Substance abuse]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[eating disorder]]s are commonly associated with BPD.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Up to 10% of people affected die by [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause, mechanism, diagnosis --&gt;
BPD's causes are unclear but seem to involve genetic, brain, environmental and social factors.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=CP2013&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Borderline Personality Disorder|last=|first=|publisher=National Health and Medical Research Council|year=2013|isbn=978-1864965643|location=Melbourne|pages=40–41|quote=In addition to the evidence identified by the systematic review, the Committee also considered a recent narrative review of studies that have evaluated biological and environmental factors as potential risk factors for BPD (including prospective studies of children and adolescents, and studies of young people with BPD)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs about five times more often in a person who has an affected close relative.&lt;ref name=NIH2016&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder/index.shtml|title=Borderline Personality Disorder|website=NIMH|access-date=16 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322130612/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder/index.shtml|archivedate=22 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse life events also appear to play a role.&lt;ref name=Lei2011/&gt; The underlying mechanism appears to involve the [[Limbic system|frontolimbic]] network of [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name=Lei2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leichsenring|first1=F|last2=Leibing|first2=E|last3=Kruse|first3=J|last4=New|first4=AS|last5=Leweke|first5=F|title=Borderline personality disorder.|journal=Lancet|date=1 January 2011|volume=377|issue=9759|pages=74–84|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61422-5|pmid=21195251}}&lt;/ref&gt; BPD is recognized by the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) as a [[personality disorder]], along with nine other such disorders.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, while a medical examination may be done to rule out other problems.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; The condition must be differentiated from an [[identity disorder|identity problem]] or [[substance use disorders]], among other possibilities.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Borderline personality disorder is typically treated with [[psychotherapy|therapy]], such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT).&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Another type, [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), may reduce the risk of suicide.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Therapy may occur one-on-one, or in a [[group therapy|group]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; While medications do not cure BPD, they may be used to help with the associated symptoms.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Some people require care in hospital.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, prognosis, and culture --&gt;
About 1.6% of people have BPD in a given year.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Females are diagnosed about three times as often as males.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; It appears to become less common among older people.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; Up to half of people improve over a ten-year period.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; People affected typically use a high amount of healthcare resources.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; There is an ongoing debate about the naming of the disorder, especially the suitability of the word ''borderline''.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; The disorder is often stigmatized in both the media and the psychiatric field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aviram|first1=RB|last2=Brodsky|first2=BS|last3=Stanley|first3=B|title=Borderline personality disorder, stigma, and treatment implications.|journal=Harvard Review of Psychiatry|date=2006|volume=14|issue=5|pages=249–56|pmid=16990170|doi=10.1080/10673220600975121}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Signs and symptoms==
Borderline personality disorder may be characterized by the following signs and symptoms:
* Markedly [[identity disturbance|disturbed sense of identity]]
* Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined [[abandonment (emotional)|abandonment]] and extreme reactions to such
* [[Splitting (psychology)|Splitting]] ("black-and-white" thinking)
* [[Impulsivity]] and impulsive or dangerous behaviors
* Intense or uncontrollable emotional reactions that often seem disproportionate to the event or situation
* Unstable and chaotic interpersonal relationships
* [[Self-destructive behavior|Self-damaging behavior]]
* Distorted [[self-image]]&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;
* [[Dissociation (psychology)|Dissociation]]
* Frequently accompanied by [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[anger]], [[substance abuse]], or [[rage (emotion)|rage]]
The most distinguishing symptoms of BPD are marked [[Social rejection#Rejection sensitivity|sensitivity to rejection]] or criticism, and intense fear of possible abandonment.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt; Overall, the features of BPD include unusually intense sensitivity in relationships with others, difficulty regulating emotions, and impulsivity. Fear of abandonment may lead to overlapping dating relationships as a new relationship is developed to  protect against abandonment in the existing relationship.  Other symptoms may include feeling unsure of one's [[personal identity]], morals, and values; having paranoid thoughts when feeling stressed; depersonalization; and, in moderate to severe cases, stress-induced breaks with reality or psychotic episodes.

===Emotions===
People with BPD may feel emotions with greater ease, depth and for a longer time than others do.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Manning_36&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|2011|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; A core characteristic of BPD is affective instability, which generally manifests as unusually intense emotional responses to environmental triggers, with a slower return to a baseline emotional state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooley|first1=Jill|last2=Butcher|first2=James|last3=Nock|first3=Matthew|last4=Mineka|first4=Susan|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2017|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|isbn=9780133852059|page=359|edition=17th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Linehan_45&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with BPD often engage in [[idealization and devaluation]] of others, alternating between high positive regard for people and great disappointment in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Marsha Linehan]]'s view, the sensitivity, intensity, and duration with which people with BPD feel emotions have both positive and negative effects.&lt;ref name = Linehan_45 /&gt; People with BPD are often exceptionally enthusiastic, idealistic, joyful, and loving.&lt;ref name = Linehan_44&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they may feel overwhelmed by negative emotions ("anxiety, depression, guilt/shame, worry, anger, etc."), experiencing intense [[grief]] instead of sadness, shame and humiliation instead of mild embarrassment, rage instead of annoyance, and panic instead of nervousness.&lt;ref name = Linehan_44 /&gt;

People with BPD are also especially sensitive to feelings of rejection, criticism, isolation, and perceived failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stiglmayr CE, Grathwol T, Linehan MM, Ihorst G, Fahrenberg J, Bohus M|title=Aversive tension in patients with borderline personality disorder: a computer-based controlled field study|journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand|volume=111|issue=5|pages=372–9|date=May 2005|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2004.00466.x|pmid=15819731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before learning other coping mechanisms, their efforts to manage or escape from their very negative emotions may lead to [[emotional isolation]], [[#Self-harm and suicide|self-injury or suicidal behavior]].&lt;ref name = reasons_NSSI /&gt; They are often aware of the intensity of their negative emotional reactions and, since they cannot regulate them, they shut them down entirely.&lt;ref name=Linehan_45 /&gt; This can be harmful to people with BPD, since negative emotions alert people to the presence of a problematic situation and move them to address it which the person with BPD would normally be aware of only to cause further distress.&lt;ref name=Linehan_45 /&gt; People with BPD may feel emotional relief after cutting themselves.&lt;ref name=DucasseCourtet2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ducasse|first1=Déborah|last2=Courtet|first2=Philippe|last3=Olié|first3=Emilie|title=Physical and Social Pains in Borderline Disorder and Neuroanatomical Correlates: A Systematic Review|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|volume=16|issue=5|year=2014|doi=10.1007/s11920-014-0443-2|pmid=24633938|page=443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While people with BPD feel [[euphoria]] (ephemeral or occasional intense joy), they are especially prone to [[dysphoria]] (a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction), depression, and/or feelings of mental and emotional distress. Zanarini et al. recognized four categories of dysphoria that are typical of this condition: extreme emotions, destructiveness or self-destructiveness, feeling fragmented or lacking identity, and feelings of [[victimization]].&lt;ref name = dysphoria&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, DeLuca CJ, Hennen J, Khera GS, Gunderson JG |title=The pain of being borderline: dysphoric states specific to borderline personality disorder |journal=Harv Rev Psychiatry |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=201–7 |year=1998 |pmid=10370445 |doi=10.3109/10673229809000330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within these categories, a BPD diagnosis is strongly associated with a combination of three specific states: feeling betrayed, feeling out of control, and "feeling like hurting myself".&lt;ref name=dysphoria /&gt; Since there is great variety in the types of dysphoria experienced by people with BPD, the amplitude of the distress is a helpful indicator of borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name=dysphoria /&gt; In addition to intense emotions, people with BPD experience emotional "lability"; or in other words, changeability. Although the term emotional lability suggests rapid changes between depression and elation, the mood swings in people with this condition actually fluctuate more frequently between anger and [[anxiety]] and between depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Koenigsberg HW, Harvey PD, Mitropoulou V|title=Characterizing affective instability in borderline personality disorder|journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=159 |issue=5 |pages=784–8 |date=May 2002|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.159.5.784|pmid=11986132|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavior===
Impulsive behavior is common, including [[substance abuse|substance]] or [[alcohol abuse]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[unprotected sex]] or [[promiscuity|indiscriminate sex with multiple partners]], [[spendthrift|reckless spending]], and [[reckless driving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Education Alliance for Borderline Personality Disorder|title=A BPD Brief|url=http://new.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/A_BPD_Brief_REV2011.pdf|accessdate=30 June 2013|page=4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912024603/http://new.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/A_BPD_Brief_REV2011.pdf|archivedate=12 September 2012|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away, and self-injury.&lt;ref name=Manning_18/&gt; People with BPD act impulsively because it gives them the feeling of immediate relief from their [[emotional pain]].&lt;ref name=Manning_18/&gt; However, in the long term, people with BPD suffer increased pain from the shame and guilt that follow such actions.&lt;ref name=Manning_18&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|2011|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cycle often begins in which people with BPD feel emotional pain, engage in impulsive behavior to relieve that pain, feel shame and guilt over their actions, feel emotional pain from the shame and guilt, and then experience stronger urges to engage in impulsive behavior to relieve the new pain.&lt;ref name=Manning_18/&gt; As time goes on, impulsive behavior may become an automatic response to emotional pain.&lt;ref name=Manning_18/&gt;

===Self-harm and suicide===

&lt;!-- Self harm --&gt;
[[Self-harm]]ing or suicidal behavior is one of the core diagnostic criteria in the [[DSM-5]].&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; Self-harm occurs in 50 to 80% of people with BPD.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Ou2008/&gt; --&gt; The most frequent method of self-harm is [[cutting]].&lt;ref name=Ou2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oumaya|first1=M|last2=Friedman|first2=S|last3=Pham|first3=A|last4=Abou Abdallah|first4=T|last5=Guelfi|first5=JD|last6=Rouillon|first6=F|title=Personnalité borderline, automutilations et suicide: revue de la littérature |journal=L'Encephale |date=October 2008|volume=34|issue=5|pages=452–8|doi=10.1016/j.encep.2007.10.007|pmid=19068333 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruising, burning, head banging or biting are not uncommon with BPD.&lt;ref name=Ou2008/&gt;

&lt;!-- Suicide --&gt;
The lifetime risk of suicide among people with BPD is between 3% and 10%.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunderson |first=John G.|last2=Links|first2=Paul S.|year=2008|title=Borderline Personality Disorder: A Clinical Guide|edition=2nd|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc|page=9|isbn=978-1585623358}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that men diagnosed with BPD are approximately twice as likely to die by suicide as women diagnosed with BPD.&lt;ref name="Kreisman J, Strauss H 2004 206"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kreisman J, Strauss H |title=Sometimes I Act Crazy. Living With Borderline Personality Disorder | year=2004 | publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons | page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that a considerable percentage of men who die by suicide may have undiagnosed BPD.&lt;ref name="Paris J 2008 21–22"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paris J |title=Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder. A Guide to Evidence-Based Practice | year=2008 | publisher=The Guilford Press | pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Reasons --&gt;
The reported reasons for self-harm differ from the reasons for suicide attempts.&lt;ref name=reasons_NSSI&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown MZ, Comtois KA, Linehan MM |title=Reasons for suicide attempts and nonsuicidal self-injury in women with borderline personality disorder |journal=J Abnorm Psychol |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=198–202 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11866174 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.111.1.198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 70% of people with BPD self-harm without trying to end their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Urnes|first1=O|title=[Self-harm and personality disorders].|journal=Tidsskrift for den Norske Laegeforening : Tidsskrift for Praktisk Medicin, NY Raekke|date=30 April 2009|volume=129|issue=9|pages=872–6|pmid=19415088|doi=10.4045/tidsskr.08.0140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for self-harm include expressing anger, self-punishment, generating normal feelings (often in response to dissociation), and distracting oneself from emotional pain or difficult circumstances.&lt;ref name=reasons_NSSI /&gt; In contrast, suicide attempts typically reflect a belief that others will be better off following the suicide.&lt;ref name=reasons_NSSI /&gt; Both suicide and self-harm are a response to feeling negative emotions.&lt;ref name=reasons_NSSI /&gt; Sexual abuse can be a particular trigger for suicidal behavior in adolescents with BPD tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Horesh N, Sever J, Apter A |title=A comparison of life events between suicidal adolescents with major depression and borderline personality disorder |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=277–83 |date=July–August 2003 |pmid=12923705 |doi=10.1016/S0010-440X(03)00091-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quantify|date=March 2014}}

===Interpersonal relationships===
People with BPD can be very sensitive to the way others treat them, by feeling intense joy and gratitude at perceived expressions of kindness, and intense sadness or anger at perceived criticism or hurtfulness.&lt;ref name="cogemo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arntz|first=Arnoud|date=September 2005|title=Introduction to special issue: cognition and emotion in borderline personality disorder|url=|journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|volume=36|issue=3|pages=167–72|doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2005.06.001|pmid=16018875|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their feelings about others often shift from admiration or love to anger or dislike after a disappointment, a threat of losing someone, or a perceived loss of esteem in the eyes of someone they value. This phenomenon, sometimes called [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], includes a shift from idealizing others to devaluing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is BPD: Symptoms |url=http://www.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.com/understading-bpd/ |accessdate=31 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210110927/http://www.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.com/understading-bpd/ |archivedate=10 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with mood disturbances, idealization and devaluation can undermine relationships with family, friends, and co-workers.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Robinson|first = David J.| title = Disordered Personalities| publisher = Rapid Psychler Press| year = 2005| pages =255–310| isbn = 978-1-894328-09-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-image can also change rapidly from healthy to unhealthy.

While strongly desiring intimacy, people with BPD tend toward insecure, avoidant or ambivalent, or fearfully preoccupied [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|attachment patterns]] in relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levy KN, Meehan KB, Weber M, Reynoso J, Clarkin JF |title=Attachment and borderline personality disorder: implications for psychotherapy |journal=Psychopathology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=64–74 |year=2005 |pmid=15802944 |doi=10.1159/000084813}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they often view the world as dangerous and malevolent.&lt;ref name="cogemo"/&gt; BPD, like other personality disorders, is linked to increased levels of chronic stress and conflict in romantic relationships, decreased satisfaction on the part of romantic partners, [[domestic violence|abuse]], and unwanted [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="Daley SE, Burge D, Hammen C 2000 451–60"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Daley SE, Burge D, Hammen C |title=Borderline personality disorder symptoms as predictors of 4-year romantic relationship dysfunction in young women: addressing issues of specificity |journal=J Abnorm Psychol |volume=109 |issue=3 |pages=451–60 |date=August 2000 |pmid=11016115 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.109.3.451|citeseerx=10.1.1.588.6902 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sense of self===
People with BPD tend to have trouble seeing a clear picture of their identity. In particular, they tend to have difficulty knowing what they value, believe, prefer, and enjoy.&lt;ref name=Manning_23/&gt; They are often unsure about their long-term goals for relationships and jobs. This difficulty with knowing who they are and what they value can cause people with BPD to experience feeling "empty" and "lost".&lt;ref name=Manning_23/&gt;

===Cognitions===
The often intense emotions experienced by people with BPD can make it difficult for them to control the focus of their attention—to concentrate.&lt;ref name=Manning_23&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|2011|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, people with BPD may tend to [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociate]], which can be thought of as an intense form of "zoning out".&lt;ref name=Manning_24&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|2011|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissociation often occurs in response to experiencing a painful event (or experiencing something that triggers the memory of a painful event). It involves the mind automatically redirecting attention away from that event, presumably to protect against experiencing intense emotion and unwanted behavioral impulses that such emotion might otherwise trigger.&lt;ref name=Manning_24/&gt; Although the mind's habit of blocking out intense painful emotions may provide temporary relief, it can also have the unwanted side effect of blocking or blunting the experience of ordinary emotions, reducing the access of people with BPD to the information contained in those emotions, which helps guide effective decision-making in daily life.&lt;ref name=Manning_24/&gt; Sometimes, it is possible for another person to tell when someone with BPD is dissociating, because their facial or vocal expressions may become flat or expressionless, or they may appear to be distracted; at other times, dissociation may be barely noticeable.&lt;ref name=Manning_24/&gt;

===Disability===
Many people with BPD are able to work if they find appropriate jobs and their condition is not too severe. People with BPD may be found to have a disability in the workplace, if the condition is severe enough that the behaviors of sabotaging relationships, engaging in risky behaviors, or intense anger prevent the person from functioning in their professional role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arvig|first1=TJ|title=Borderline personality disorder and disability|journal=AAOHN Journal|date=April 2011|volume=59|issue=4|pages=158–60|doi=10.3928/08910162-20110328-04|pmid=21462898|doi-broken-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
As is the case with other mental disorders, the causes of BPD are complex and not fully agreed upon.&lt;ref name="mayo"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/borderline-personality-disorder/DS00442/DSECTION=3| title = Borderline personality disorder| publisher = Mayo Clinic| accessdate = 15 May 2008| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430112844/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/borderline-personality-disorder/DS00442/DSECTION%3D3| archivedate = 30 April 2008| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that BPD and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] ([[PTSD]]) may be related in some way.&lt;ref name="BPD &amp; PTSD"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Gunderson | first1 = JG | last2 = Sabo | first2 = AN |title= The phenomenological and conceptual interface between borderline personality disorder and PTSD |journal= Am J Psychiatry | volume= 150 | pages = 19–27 |year=1993 |url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=169168 |pmid=8417576 |issue=1 | doi=10.1176/ajp.150.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most researchers agree that a history of childhood trauma can be a contributing factor,&lt;ref name=kluft&gt;{{Cite book|title=Incest-Related Syndromes of Adult Psychopathology |first=Richard P.|last=Kluft |year=1990 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub, Inc.|pages=83, 89 |isbn=978-0-88048-160-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but less attention has historically been paid to investigating the causal roles played by congenital brain abnormalities, genetics, neurobiological factors, and environmental factors other than trauma.&lt;ref name="mayo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Zanarini | first1 = MC | last2 = Frankenburg | first2 = FR |title=Pathways to the development of borderline personality disorder |journal=J.

Social factors include how people interact in their early development with their family, friends, and other children.&lt;ref name="Psych Central"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/symptoms-of-borderline-personality-disorder/0001063|title=Borderline Personality Disorder|publisher=psychcentral.com|last=Grohol|first=John M.|date=30 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527125005/http://psychcentral.com/lib/symptoms-of-borderline-personality-disorder/0001063|archivedate=27 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} Psychological factors include the individual's personality and temperament, shaped by their environment and learned coping skills that deal with stress.&lt;ref name="Psych Central" /&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} These different factors together suggest that there are multiple factors that may contribute to the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/basics/causes/con-20023204|title=Borderline personality disorder: Understanding this challenging mental illness|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830073811/http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/basics/causes/con-20023204|archivedate=30 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
The [[heritability]] of BPD has been estimated at 40%.&lt;ref name=Her2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amad|first1=A|last2=Ramoz|first2=N|last3=Thomas|first3=P|last4=Jardri|first4=R|last5=Gorwood|first5=P|title=Genetics of borderline personality disorder: systematic review and proposal of an integrative model.|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date=March 2014|volume=40|pages=6–19|pmid=24456942|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, 40 percent of the [[statistical variability|variability]] in liability underlying BPD in the population can be explained by [[human genetic variation|genetic differences]]. [[Twin studies]] may overestimate the effect of [[genes]] on variability in personality disorders due to the complicating factor of a shared family environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Torgersen | first = S |title=Genetics of patients with borderline personality disorder |journal=Psychiatr. Clin. North Am. |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10729927 |doi= 10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70139-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the researchers of this study concluded that personality disorders "seem to be more strongly influenced by genetic effects than almost any axis I disorder [e.g., [[bipolar disorder]], depression, eating disorders], and more than most broad personality dimensions."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Torgersen | first1 = S | last2 = Lygren | first2 = S | last3 = Oien | first3 = PA |title= A twin study of personality disorders |journal= Compr Psychiatry | volume = 41 | issue =6 |pages=416–25 |year=2000 |pmid=11086146 |doi=10.1053/comp.2000.16560|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the study found that BPD was estimated to be the third most-heritable personality disorder out of the 10 personality disorders reviewed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Twin, sibling, and other family studies indicate partial [[heritability]] for impulsive aggression, but studies of [[serotonin]]-related genes have suggested only modest contributions to behavior.&lt;ref name=neurotrauma&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Goodman | first1 = M | last2 = New | first2 = A | last3 = Siever | first3 = L |title=Trauma, genes, and the neurobiology of personality disorders |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1032 | issue = 1 |pages=104–16 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15677398 |doi= 10.1196/annals.1314.008|bibcode = 2004NYASA1032..104G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Families with twins in the Netherlands were participants of an ongoing study by Trull and colleagues, in which 711 pairs of siblings and 561 parents were examined to identify the location of genetic traits that influenced the development of BPD.&lt;ref name="Possible Genetic Causes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081216114100.htm|title=Possible Genetic Causes Of Borderline Personality Disorder Identified|publisher=sciencedaily.com|date=20 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501161311/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081216114100.htm|archivedate=1 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research collaborators found that genetic material on [[Chromosome 9 (human)|chromosome 9]] was linked to BPD features.&lt;ref name="Possible Genetic Causes" /&gt; The researchers concluded that "genetic factors play a major role in individual differences of borderline personality disorder features."&lt;ref name="Possible Genetic Causes" /&gt; These same researchers had earlier concluded in a previous study that 42 percent of variation in BPD features was attributable to genetic influences and 58 percent was attributable to environmental influences.&lt;ref name="Possible Genetic Causes" /&gt; Genes under investigation {{as of|2012|lc=y}} include the 7-repeat polymorphism of the [[Dopamine receptor D4|dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4)]] on [[Chromosome 11 (human)#Genes|chromosome 11]], which has been linked to disorganized attachment, whilst the combined effect of the 7-repeat polymorphism and the 10/10 dopamine transporter (DAT) genotype has been linked to abnormalities in inhibitory control, both noted features of BPD.&lt;ref name="Brain Structure and Function"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Neil|first=Aisling|author2=Thomas Frodl|title=Brain structure and function in borderline personality disorder|journal=Brain Structure and Function|date=18 January 2012|doi=10.1007/s00429-012-0379-4|pmid=22252376|volume=217|issue=4|pages=767–782}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a possible connection to [[Chromosome 5 (human)|chromosome 5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lubke|first1=GH|last2=Laurin|first2=C|last3=Amin|first3=N|last4=Hottenga|first4=JJ|last5=Willemsen|first5=G|last6=van Grootheest|first6=G|last7=Abdellaoui|first7=A|last8=Karssen|first8=LC|last9=Oostra|first9=BA|last10=van Duijn|first10=CM|last11=Penninx|first11=BW|last12=Boomsma|first12=DI|title=Genome-wide analyses of borderline personality features.|journal=Molecular Psychiatry|date=August 2014|volume=19|issue=8|pages=923–9|pmid=23979607|doi=10.1038/mp.2013.109|pmc=3872258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain abnormalities===
A number of neuroimaging studies in BPD have reported findings of reductions in regions of the brain involved in the regulation of stress responses and emotion, affecting the hippocampus, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the amygdala, amongst other areas.&lt;ref name="Brain Structure and Function" /&gt; A smaller number of studies have used [[magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] to explore changes in the concentrations of neurometabolites in certain brain regions of BPD patients, looking specifically at neurometabolites such as N-acetylaspartate, creatine, glutamate-related compounds, and choline-containing compounds.&lt;ref name="Brain Structure and Function" /&gt;

====Hippocampus====
The [[hippocampus]] tends to be smaller in people with BPD, as it is in people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, in BPD, unlike PTSD, the [[amygdala]] also tends to be smaller.&lt;ref name = "Chapman p47"&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Gratz|2007|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amygdala====
The [[amygdala]]e are smaller and more active in people with BPD.&lt;ref name = "Chapman p47" /&gt; Decreased amygdala volume has also been found in people with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szeszko PR, Robinson D, Alvir JM |title=Orbital frontal and amygdala volume reductions in obsessive-compulsive disorder |journal=Arch. Gen. Psychiatry |volume=56 |issue=10 |pages=913–9 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10530633 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.56.10.913|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study has found unusually strong activity in the left amygdalas of people with BPD when they experience and view displays of negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herpertz SC, Dietrich TM, Wenning B |title=Evidence of abnormal amygdala functioning in borderline personality disorder: a functional MRI study |journal=Biol.

====Prefrontal cortex====
[[File:Prefrontal cortex (left) - lateral view.png|thumb|Prefrontal cortex]]
The [[prefrontal cortex]] tends to be less active in people with BPD, especially when recalling memories of abandonment.&lt;ref name = "Schmahl"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmahl CG, Elzinga BM, Vermetten E, Sanislow C, McGlashan TH, Bremner JD |title=Neural correlates of memories of abandonment in women with and without borderline personality disorder |journal=Biol. Psychiatry |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=142–51 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12873804 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3223(02)01720-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relative inactivity occurs in the right [[anterior cingulate]] (areas [[Brodmann area 24|24]] and [[Brodmann area 32|32]]).&lt;ref name = "Schmahl" /&gt;

Given its role in regulating emotional arousal, the relative inactivity of the prefrontal cortex might explain the difficulties people with BPD experience in regulating their emotions and responses to stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Gratz|2007|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis====
The [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) regulates [[cortisol]] production, which is released in response to stress. Cortisol production tends to be elevated in people with BPD, indicating a hyperactive HPA axis in these individuals.&lt;ref name=Grossman&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grossman R, Yehuda R, Siever L |title=The dexamethasone suppression test and glucocorticoid receptors in borderline personality disorder |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=821 |issue= 1|pages=459–64 |date=June 1997 |pmid=9238229 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb48305.x |bibcode=1997NYASA.821..459G }}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes them to experience a greater biological stress response, which might explain their greater vulnerability to [[irritability]].&lt;ref name="Chapman p49"&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Gratz|2007|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since traumatic events can increase cortisol production and HPA axis activity, one possibility is that the prevalence of higher than average activity in the HPA axis of people with BPD may simply be a reflection of the higher than average prevalence of traumatic childhood and maturational events among people with BPD.&lt;ref name="Chapman p49"/&gt; Another possibility is that, by heightening their sensitivity to stressful events, increased cortisol production may predispose those with BPD to experience stressful childhood and maturational events as traumatic.

Increased cortisol production is also associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Heeringen K, Audenaert K, Van de Wiele L, Verstraete A |title=Cortisol in violent suicidal behaviour: association with personality and monoaminergic activity |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=181–9 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11074106 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(99)00180-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurobiological factors===

====Estrogen====
Individual differences in women's [[estrogen]] cycles may be related to the expression of BPD symptoms in female patients.&lt;ref name=DeSoto_book&gt;{{cite book |last1=DeSoto |first1=M.

===Developmental factors===

====Childhood trauma====
There is a strong correlation between [[child abuse]], especially [[child sexual abuse]], and development of BPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohen P |title=Child development and personality disorder |journal=Psychiatr Clin North Am |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=477–93 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18638647 |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2008.03.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Herman91&gt;{{cite book |author1=Herman, Judith Lewis |author2=Judith Herman MD |title=Trauma and recovery |publisher=BasicBooks |location=New York |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=978-0-465-08730-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AxisOne/AxisTwo"/&gt; Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ball JS, Links PS | date=February 2009 | title =Borderline personality disorder and childhood trauma: evidence for a causal relationship | journal = Curr Psychiatry Rep | volume = 11 | issue =1 | pages = 63–8 |pmid=19187711 | doi=10.1007/s11920-009-0010-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients with BPD have been found to be significantly more likely to report having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/basics/risk-factors/con-20023204|title=Borderline personality disorder: Understanding this challenging mental illness|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830054834/http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/basics/risk-factors/con-20023204|archivedate=30 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also report a high incidence of incest and loss of caregivers in early childhood.&lt;ref name=failchild&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, Reich DB |title=Biparental failure in the childhood experiences of borderline patients |journal=J Personal Disord |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=264–73 |year=2000 |pmid=11019749 |doi=10.1521/pedi.2000.14.3.264 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently.&lt;ref name="failchild"/&gt; Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver and abuse by a male caregiver were significantly more likely to experience sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.&lt;ref name="failchild"/&gt;

It has been suggested that children who experience chronic early maltreatment and [[Attachment theory|attachment]] difficulties may go on to develop borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name="Dozier-1999"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dozier |first1=Mary |last2=Stovall-McClough |first2=K. Chase |last3=Albus |first3=Kathleen E. |year=1999 |chapter=Attachment and psychopathology in adulthood |editor1-last=Cassidy |editor1-first=Jude |editor2-last=Shaver |editor2-first=Phillip R. |title=Handbook of attachment |pages=497–519 |location=New York |publisher=[[Guilford Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the psychoanalytic tradition, [[Otto Kernberg]] argues that a child's failure to achieve the developmental task of [[Otto F.

===Neurological patterns===
The intensity and reactivity of a person's [[negative affectivity]], or tendency to feel negative emotions, predicts BPD symptoms more strongly than does [[childhood sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; This finding, differences in brain structure (see [[#Brain abnormalities|Brain abnormalities]]), and the fact that some patients with BPD do not report a traumatic history,&lt;ref name="Gratz2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Gratz|2007|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that BPD is distinct from the [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] which frequently accompanies it. Thus, researchers examine developmental causes in addition to childhood trauma.

Research published in January 2013 by Dr. Anthony Ruocco at the [[University of Toronto]] has highlighted two patterns of brain activity that may underlie the dysregulation of emotion indicated in this disorder: (1) increased activity in the brain circuits responsible for the experience of heightened emotional pain, coupled with (2) reduced activation of the brain circuits that normally regulate or suppress these generated painful emotions. These two neural networks are seen to be dysfunctionally operative in the frontolimbic regions, but the specific regions vary widely in individuals, which calls for the analysis of more neuroimaging studies.&lt;ref name="Ruocco, Anthony C.; Amirthavasagam, Sathya, Choi-Kain, Lois W.; McMain, Shelley F. 2013 153–160"&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2013 |title=Neural Correlates of Negative Emotionality in Borderline Personality Disorder: An Activation-Likelihood-Estimation Meta-Analysis |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=153–160 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.07.014 |pmid=22906520|last1=Ruocco |first1=A. C. |last2=Amirthavasagam |first2=S. |last3=Choi-Kain |first3=L. W. |last4=McMain |first4=S. F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also (contrary to the results of earlier studies) sufferers of BPD showed less activation in the [[amygdala]] in situations of increased negative emotionality than the control group. Dr. John Krystal, editor of the journal ''Biological Psychiatry'', wrote that these results "[added] to the impression that people with borderline personality disorder are 'set-up' by their brains to have stormy emotional lives, although not necessarily unhappy or unproductive lives".&lt;ref name="Ruocco, Anthony C.; Amirthavasagam, Sathya, Choi-Kain, Lois W.; McMain, Shelley F. 2013 153–160" /&gt; Their emotional instability has been found to correlate with differences in several brain regions.&lt;ref name="Koenigsberg"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Koenigsberg |first=Harold W |last2=Siever |first2=Larry J |last3=Lee |first3=Hedok |last4=Pizzarello |first4=Scott |last5=New |first5=Antonia S |last6=Goodman |first6=Marianne |last7=Cheng |first7=Hu |last8=Flory |first8=Janine |last9=Prohovnik |first9=Isak |year=2009 |title=Neural correlates of emotion processing in borderline personality disorder. |journal=Psychiatry Research |volume=172 |issue=3 |pages=192–9 |doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2008.07.010 |pmc=4153735 |pmid=19394205 |quote=BPD patients demonstrated greater differences in activation than controls, when viewing negative pictures compared with rest, in the amygdala, fusiform gyrus, primary visual areas, superior temporal gyrus (STG), and premotor areas, while healthy controls showed greater differences than BPD patients in the insula, middle temporal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mediating and moderating factors===

====Executive function====
While high [[Rejection sensitivity#Rejection sensitivity|rejection sensitivity]] is associated with stronger symptoms of borderline personality disorder, [[executive function]] appears to [[Mediation (statistics)|mediate]] the relationship between rejection sensitivity and BPD symptoms.&lt;ref name="Executive_function"/&gt; That is, a group of [[cognitive processes]] that include planning, [[working memory]], attention, and problem-solving might be the mechanism through which rejection sensitivity impacts BPD symptoms. A 2008 study found that the relationship between a person's rejection sensitivity and BPD symptoms was stronger when executive function was lower and that the relationship was weaker when executive function was higher.&lt;ref name="Executive_function"/&gt; This suggests that high executive function might help protect people with high rejection sensitivity against symptoms of BPD.&lt;ref name="Executive_function"/&gt; A 2012 study found that problems in working memory might contribute to greater impulsivity in people with BPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1601-5215.2011.00630.x |pmid=25287177 |title=Impaired working memory and normal sustained attention in borderline personality disorder |year=2012 |last1=Lazzaretti |first1=Matteo |last2=Morandotti |first2=Niccolò |last3=Sala |first3=Michela |last4=Isola |first4=Miriam |last5=Frangou |first5=Sophia |last6=De Vidovich |first6=Giulia |last7=Marraffini |first7=Elisa |last8=Gambini |first8=Francesca |last9=Barale |first9=Francesco |last10=Zappoli |first10=Federico |last11=Caverzasi |first11=Edgardo |last12=Brambilla |first12=Paolo |journal=Acta Neuropsychiatrica |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=349–55|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family environment====
Family environment mediates the effect of child sexual abuse on the development of BPD. An unstable family environment predicts the development of the disorder, while a stable family environment predicts a lower risk. One possible explanation is that a stable environment buffers against its development.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bradley R, Jenei J, Westen D |title=Etiology of borderline personality disorder: disentangling the contributions of intercorrelated antedents |journal=J. Nerv. Ment. Dis. |volume=193 |issue=1 |pages=24–31 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15674131 |doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000149215.88020.7c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-complexity====
[[Self-complexity]], or considering one's self to have many different characteristics, appears to moderate the relationship between Actual-Ideal [[Self-discrepancy theory|self-discrepancy]] issues and the development of BPD symptoms. That is, for individuals who believe that their actual characteristics do not match the characteristics that they hope to acquire, high self-complexity reduces the impact of their conflicted self-image on BPD symptoms.&lt;ref name=Parker/&gt; However, self-complexity does not moderate the relationship between Actual-Ought [[Self-discrepancy theory|self-discrepancy]] and the development of BPD symptoms. That is, for individuals who believe that their actual characteristics do not match the characteristics that they should already have, high self-complexity does not reduce the impact of their conflicted self-image on BPD symptoms. The protective role of self-complexity in Actual-Ideal self-discrepancy, but not in Actual-Ought self-discrepancy, suggests that the impact of conflicted or unstable self-image in BPD depends on whether the individual views himself or herself in terms of characteristics that they hope to acquire, or in terms of characteristics that they ''should'' already have acquired.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Parker | first1 = AG | last2 = Boldero | first2 = JM | last3 = Bell | first3 = RC |title= Borderline personality disorder features: the role of self-discrepancies and self-complexity |journal= Psychol Psychother |volume= 79 |issue=Pt 3 |pages = 309–21 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16945194 |doi= 10.1348/147608305X70072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thought suppression====
A 2005 study found that [[thought suppression]], or conscious attempts to avoid thinking certain thoughts, mediates the relationship between [[negative affectivity|emotional vulnerability]] and BPD symptoms.&lt;ref name = Rosenthal&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Rosenthal | first1 = MZ | last2 = Cheavens | first2 = JS | last3 = Lejuez | first3 = CW | last4 = Lynch | first4 = TR |title=Thought suppression mediates the relationship between negative affect and borderline personality disorder symptoms |journal= Behav Res Ther |volume=43 | issue = 9 |pages= 1173–85 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16005704 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2004.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later study found that the relationship between emotional vulnerability and BPD symptoms is not necessarily mediated by thought suppression. However, this study did find that thought suppression mediates the relationship between an invalidating environment and BPD symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Sauer | first1 = SE | last2 = Baer | first2 = Ruth A. | last3 = Baer | first3 = RA |title=Relationships between thought suppression and symptoms of borderline personality disorder |journal= J. Pers. Disord. |volume= 23 |issue=1 |pages= 48–61 |date=February 2009 |pmid = 19267661 | doi = 10.1521/pedi.2009.23.1.48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is based on a clinical [[psychiatric assessment|assessment]] by a mental health professional. The best method is to present the criteria of the disorder to a person and to ask them if they feel that these characteristics accurately describe them.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt; Actively involving people with BPD in determining their diagnosis can help them become more willing to accept it.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt; Although some clinicians prefer not to tell people with BPD what their diagnosis is, either from concern about the stigma attached to this condition or because BPD used to be considered untreatable, it is usually helpful for the person with BPD to know their diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt; This helps them know that others have had similar experiences and can point them toward effective treatments.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt;

In general, the psychological evaluation includes asking the patient about the beginning and severity of symptoms, as well as other questions about how symptoms impact the patient's quality of life. Issues of particular note are suicidal ideations, experiences with self-harm, and thoughts about harming others.&lt;ref name=Mayo_Clinic_Diagnosis&gt;{{cite web|title=Personality Disorders: Tests and Diagnosis|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/personality-disorders/DS00562/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=13 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606185940/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/personality-disorders/DS00562/DSECTION%3Dtests-and-diagnosis|archivedate=6 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis is based both on the person's report of their symptoms and on the clinician's own observations.&lt;ref name=Mayo_Clinic_Diagnosis /&gt; Additional tests for BPD can include a physical exam and laboratory tests to rule out other possible triggers for symptoms, such as thyroid conditions or substance abuse.&lt;ref name = Mayo_Clinic_Diagnosis /&gt; The [[ICD-10]] manual refers to the disorder as ''emotionally unstable personality disorder'' and has similar diagnostic criteria. In the [[DSM-5]], the name of the disorder remains the same as in the previous editions.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;

===''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual''===
&lt;!-- Please do not add diagnosis criteria as this constitutes a copyright violation. APA has forbidden us.--&gt;
The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' fifth edition (DSM-5) has removed the multiaxial system. Consequently, all disorders, including personality disorders, are listed in Section II of the manual. A person must meet 5 of 9 criteria to receive a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-borderine personality disorders" /&gt; The [[DSM-5]] defines the main features of BPD as a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, [[self image]], and [[affect (psychology)|affect]], as well as markedly impulsive behavior.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-borderine personality disorders"&gt;{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2013|pages=663–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the DSM-5 proposes alternative diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder in section III, "Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders". These alternative criteria are based on trait research and include specifying at least four of seven maladaptive traits.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-borderline-alternative"&gt;{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2013|pages=766–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Marsha Linehan]], many mental health professionals find it challenging to diagnose BPD using the DSM criteria, since these criteria describe such a wide variety of behaviors.&lt;ref name=Manning_13&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|2011|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address this issue, Linehan has grouped the symptoms of BPD under five main areas of dysregulation: emotions, behavior, interpersonal relationships, sense of self, and cognition.&lt;ref name=Manning_13/&gt;

===International Classification of Disease===
The [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD-10]] defines a disorder that is conceptually similar to borderline personality disorder, called ''({{ICD10|F|60|3|f|60}}) Emotionally unstable personality disorder''. Its two subtypes are described below.&lt;ref name="borderline"&gt;[http://bpdfamily.com/pdfs/ICD-10.pdf Emotionally unstable personality disorder – [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] 10th Revision ([[ICD-10]]) – [[World Health Organization]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020191619/http://bpdfamily.com/pdfs/ICD-10.pdf |date=20 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;F60.30 Impulsive type
At least three of the following must be present, one of which must be (2):
# marked tendency to act unexpectedly and without consideration of the consequences;
# marked tendency to engage in quarrelsome behavior and to have conflicts with others, especially when impulsive acts are thwarted or criticized;
# liability to outbursts of anger or violence, with inability to control the resulting behavioral explosions;
# difficulty in maintaining any course of action that offers no immediate reward;
# unstable and capricious (impulsive, whimsical) mood.

;F60.31 Borderline type
At least three of the symptoms mentioned in ''F60.30 Impulsive type'' must be present [see above], with at least two of the following in addition:
# disturbances in and uncertainty about self-image, aims, and internal preferences;
# liability to become involved in intense and unstable relationships, often leading to emotional crisis;
# excessive efforts to avoid abandonment;
# recurrent threats or acts of self-harm;
# chronic feelings of [[emptiness]].
# demonstrates impulsive behavior, e.g., speeding in a car or substance abuse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Neil R. |last1=Carlson |first2=C. Donald |last2=Heth |title=Psychology: The Science of Behavior |publisher=Pearson Canada |year=2010 |page=570}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ICD-10 also describes some general criteria that define what is considered a [[personality disorder]].

===Millon's subtypes===
[[Theodore Millon]] has proposed four subtypes of BPD. He suggests that an individual diagnosed with BPD may exhibit none, one, or more of the following:&lt;ref name="Millon"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Millon |first1=Theodore |year=2004 |title=Personality Disorders in Modern Life |page=4 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-471-23734-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| '''Discouraged borderline''' (including [[Avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]], [[Depressive personality disorder|depressive]] and [[Dependent personality disorder|dependent]] features)
| Pliant, submissive, loyal, humble; feels vulnerable and in constant jeopardy; feels hopeless, depressed, helpless, and powerless.
|-
| '''Petulant borderline''' (including [[Passive-aggressive personality disorder|negativistic]] features)
| Negativistic, impatient, restless, as well as stubborn, defiant, sullen, pessimistic, and resentful; easily feels "slighted" and quickly disillusioned.

| '''Impulsive borderline''' (including [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] or [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] features)
| Capricious, superficial, flighty, distractible, frenetic, and seductive; fearing loss, the individual becomes agitated; gloomy and irritable; and potentially suicidal.
|-
| '''Self-destructive borderline''' (including [[Depressive personality disorder|depressive]] or [[Self-defeating personality disorder|masochistic]] features)
| Inward-turning, intropunitively (self-punishing) angry; conforming, deferential, and ingratiating behaviors have deteriorated; increasingly high-strung and moody; possible suicide.
|}

===Misdiagnosis===
People with BPD may be misdiagnosed for a variety of reasons. One reason for misdiagnosis is BPD has symptoms that coexist ([[comorbidity]]) with other disorders such as depression, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), and bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="Chanen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chanen|first1=Andrew M|last2=Thompson|first2=Katherine N|title=Prescribing and borderline personality disorder|journal=Australian Prescriber|date=1 April 2016|volume=39|issue=2|pages=49–53|doi=10.18773/austprescr.2016.019|pmid=27340322|pmc=4917638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meaney|first1=Rebecca|last2=Hasking|first2=Penelope|last3=Reupert|first3=Andrea|title=Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms in College Students:The Complex Interplay Between Alexithymia, Emotional Dysregulation and Rumination|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=6|pages=e0157294|date=2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0157294 |pmid=27348858|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1157294M|pmc=4922551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family members===
People with BPD are prone to feeling angry at members of their family and alienated from them. On their part, family members often feel angry and helpless at how their BPD family members relate to them.&lt;ref name=Gund2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunderson|first=John G.|title=Borderline Personality Disorder|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=26 May 2011|volume=364|issue=21|pages=2037–2042|doi=10.1056/NEJMcp1007358|pmid=21612472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents of adults with BPD are often both over-involved and under-involved in family interactions.&lt;ref name="parents"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Allen DM, Farmer RG |title=Family relationships of adults with borderline personality disorder |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=43–51 |year=1996 |pmid=8770526 |doi=10.1016/S0010-440X(96)90050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In romantic relationships, BPD is linked to increased levels of chronic stress and conflict, decreased satisfaction of romantic partners, [[domestic violence|abuse]], and unwanted [[pregnancy]]. However, these links may apply to personality disorders in general.&lt;ref name="Daley SE, Burge D, Hammen C 2000 451–60"/&gt;

===Adolescence===
Onset of symptoms typically occurs during adolescence or young adulthood, although symptoms suggestive of this disorder can sometimes be observed in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms among adolescents that predict the development of BPD in adulthood may include problems with body-image, extreme sensitivity to rejection, behavioral problems, non-suicidal self-injury, attempts to find exclusive relationships, and severe shame.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt; Many adolescents experience these symptoms without going on to develop BPD, but those who experience them are 9 times as likely as their peers to develop BPD. They are also more likely to develop other forms of long-term social disabilities.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt; Clinicians are discouraged from diagnosing anyone with BPD before the age of 18, due to the normal ups and downs of adolescence and a still-developing personality. However, BPD can sometimes be diagnosed before age 18, in which case the features must have been present and consistent for at least one year.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR"&gt;{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2000}}{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A BPD diagnosis in adolescence might predict that the disorder will continue into adulthood.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Netherton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Netherton |first1=S.D. |last2=Holmes |first2=D. |last3=Walker |first3=C.E. |year=1999 |title=Child and Adolescent Psychological Disorders: Comprehensive Textbook |location=New York, NY |publisher=Oxford University Press}}{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among adolescents who warrant a BPD diagnosis, there appears to be one group in which the disorder remains stable over time and another group in which the individuals move in and out of the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Fact_or_Fiction&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller AL, Muehlenkamp JJ, Jacobson CM |title=Fact or fiction: diagnosing borderline personality disorder in adolescents |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=969–81 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18358579 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2008.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier diagnoses may be helpful in creating a more effective treatment plan for the adolescent.&lt;ref name = "DSM-IV-TR"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Netherton"/&gt; Family therapy is considered a helpful component of treatment for adolescents with BPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential diagnosis and comorbidity===
Lifetime [[comorbid]] (co-occurring) conditions are common in BPD. Compared to those diagnosed with other personality disorders, people with BPD showed a higher rate of also meeting criteria for&lt;ref name = comorbidity&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, Dubo ED |title=Axis I comorbidity of borderline personality disorder |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=155 |issue=12 |pages=1733–9 |date=December 1998 |pmid=9842784 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=155&amp;page=1733 |doi=10.1176/ajp.155.12.1733|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study found that at some point in their lives, 75 percent of people with BPD meet criteria for mood disorders, especially major depression and Bipolar I, and nearly 75 percent meet criteria for an anxiety disorder.&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grant BF, Chou SP, Goldstein RB |title=Prevalence, correlates, disability, and comorbidity of DSM-IV borderline personality disorder: results from the Wave 2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=533–45 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18426259 |pmc=2676679 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v69n0404|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 73 percent meet criteria for substance abuse or dependency, and about 40 percent for PTSD.&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"/&gt; It is noteworthy that less than half of the participants with BPD in this study presented with PTSD, a prevalence similar to that reported in an earlier study.&lt;ref name=comorbidity /&gt; The finding that less than half of patients with BPD experience PTSD during their lives challenges the theory that BPD and PTSD are the same disorder.&lt;ref name=comorbidity /&gt;

There are marked gender differences in the types of comorbid conditions a person with BPD is likely to have—&lt;ref name=comorbidity /&gt; a higher percentage of males with BPD meet criteria for substance-use disorders, while a higher percentage of females with BPD meet criteria for PTSD and eating disorders.&lt;ref name = comorbidity /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gregory |first=Robert J. |date=1 November 2006 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/clinical-challenges-co-occurring-borderline-personality-and-substance-use-disorders |title=Clinical Challenges in Co-occurring Borderline Personality and Substance Use Disorders |work=Psychiatric Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921063228/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/clinical-challenges-co-occurring-borderline-personality-and-substance-use-disorders |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, 38% of participants with BPD met the criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD.&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt; In another study, 6 of 41 participants (15%) met the criteria for an [[autism spectrum]] disorder (a subgroup that had significantly more frequent suicide attempts).&lt;ref name=Ryden2008&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 5| issue = 1| pages = 22–30| first1 = Göran| last1 = Rydén| first2 = Eleonore| last2 = Rydén| first3 = Jerker| last3 = Hetta| title = Borderline personality disorder and autism spectrum disorder in females: A cross-sectional study| journal = Clinical Neuropsychiatry| accessdate = 7 February 2013| year = 2008| url = http://www.clinicalneuropsychiatry.org/pdf/04_ryden_hetta.pdf| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055225/http://www.clinicalneuropsychiatry.org/pdf/04_ryden_hetta.pdf| archivedate = 21 September 2013| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless that it is an infradiagnosed disorder, a few studies have shown that the "lower expressions" of it might lead to wrong diagnoses. The many and shifting Axis I disorders in people with BPD can sometimes cause clinicians to miss the presence of the underlying personality disorder. However, since a complex pattern of Axis I diagnoses has been found to strongly predict the presence of BPD, clinicians can use the feature of a complex pattern of comorbidity as a clue that BPD might be present.&lt;ref name=comorbidity /&gt;

=====Mood disorders=====
Many people with borderline personality disorder also have [[mood disorders]], such as major depressive disorder or a bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; Some characteristics of BPD are similar to those of mood disorders, which can complicate the diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bolton S, Gunderson JG |title=Distinguishing borderline personality disorder from bipolar disorder: differential diagnosis and implications |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=153 |issue=9 |pages=1202–7 |date=September 1996 |pmid=8780426 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=153&amp;page=1202 |doi=10.1176/ajp.153.9.1202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APAguide&gt;{{cite journal |title=Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder.

At face value, the affective lability of BPD and the rapid mood cycling of bipolar disorders can seem very similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mackinnon DF, Pies R |title=Affective instability as rapid cycling: theoretical and clinical implications for borderline personality and bipolar spectrum disorders |journal=Bipolar Disord |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16411976 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-5618.2006.00283.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be difficult even for experienced clinicians, if they are unfamiliar with BPD, to differentiate between the mood swings of these two conditions.&lt;ref name=Chapman_88&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Gratz|2007|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some clear differences.&lt;ref name=Chapman_87 /&gt;

First, the mood swings of BPD and bipolar disorder tend to have different durations. In some people with bipolar disorder, episodes of depression or mania last for at least two weeks at a time, which is much longer than moods last in people with BPD.&lt;ref name=Chapman_87 /&gt; Even among those who experience bipolar disorder with more rapid mood shifts, their moods usually last for days, while the moods of people with BPD can change in minutes or hours.&lt;ref name=Chapman_88/&gt; So while euphoria and impulsivity in someone with BPD might resemble a [[manic episode]], the experience would be too brief to qualify as a manic episode.&lt;ref name = BPD_vs_BD /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chapman_88/&gt;

Second, the moods of bipolar disorder do not respond to changes in the environment, while the moods of BPD do respond to changes in the environment.&lt;ref name = BPD_vs_BD&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jamison, Kay R. |author2=Goodwin, Frederick Joseph |title=Manic-depressive illness |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1990 |page=108 |isbn=978-0-19-503934-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a positive event would not lift the depressed mood caused by bipolar disorder, but a positive event would potentially lift the depressed mood of someone with BPD. Similarly, an undesirable event would not dampen the [[euphoria]] caused by bipolar disorder, but an undesirable event would dampen the euphoria of someone with borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name = BPD_vs_BD /&gt;

Third, when people with BPD experience euphoria, it is usually without the racing thoughts and decreased need for sleep that are typical of [[hypomania]],&lt;ref name = BPD_vs_BD /&gt; though a later 2013 study of data collected in 2004 found that borderline personality disorder diagnosis and symptoms were associated with chronic sleep disturbances, including difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and waking earlier than desired, as well as with the consequences of poor sleep, and noted that "[f]ew studies have examined the experience of chronic sleep disturbances in those with borderline personality disorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Selby EA |title=Chronic sleep disturbances and borderline personality disorder symptoms |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=81 |issue=5 |pages=941–7 |date=October 2013 |pmid=23731205 |doi=10.1037/a0033201 |pmc=4129646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the two conditions have a number of similar symptoms, BPD was once considered to be a mild form of [[bipolar disorder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akiskal HS, Yerevanian BI, Davis GC, King D, Lemmi H |title=The nosologic status of borderline personality: clinical and polysomnographic study |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=142 |issue=2 |pages=192–8 |date=February 1985 |pmid=3970243 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=142&amp;page=192 |doi=10.1176/ajp.142.2.192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gunderson JG, Elliott GR |title=The interface between borderline personality disorder and affective disorder |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=142 |issue=3 |pages=277–88 |date=March 1985 |pmid=2857532 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=142&amp;page=277 |doi=10.1176/ajp.142.3.277}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to exist on the bipolar spectrum. However, this would require that the underlying mechanism causing these symptoms be the same for both conditions. Differences in phenomenology, family history, longitudinal course, and responses to treatment indicate that this is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paris J |title=Borderline or bipolar?

=====Premenstrual dysphoric disorder=====
[[Premenstrual dysphoric disorder]] (PMDD) occurs in 3–8 percent of women.&lt;ref name=Rapkin&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rapkin |first1=AJ |last2=Lewis |first2=EI |title=Treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder |journal=Womens Health (Lond Engl) |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=537–56 |date= November 2013 |pmid=24161307 |doi=10.2217/whe.13.62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms begin 5–11 days before menstruation and cease a few days after it begins.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Symptoms may include marked mood swings, irritability, depressed mood, feeling hopeless or suicidal, a subjective sense of being overwhelmed or out of control, anxiety, binge eating, difficulty concentrating, and substantial impairment of interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name= "Grady-Weliky"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Grady-Weliky | first = TA | title= Premenstrual dysphoric disorder |journal= N.

Although some of the symptoms of PMDD and BPD are similar, they are different disorders. They are distinguishable by the timing and duration of symptoms, which are markedly different: the symptoms of PMDD occur only during the [[luteal phase]] of the [[menstrual cycle]],&lt;ref name = Grady-Weliky /&gt; whereas BPD symptoms occur persistently at all stages of the menstrual cycle. In addition, the symptoms of PMDD do not include impulsivity.&lt;ref name="Grady-Weliky" /&gt;

More than two-thirds of people diagnosed with BPD also meet the criteria for another Axis II personality disorder at some point in their lives. (In a 2008 study, the rate was 73.9 percent.)&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"/&gt; Cluster A disorders, which include [[paranoid personality disorder|paranoid]], [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]], and [[schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]], are the most common, with a prevalence of 50.4 percent in people with BPD.&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"/&gt;

The second most common is another Cluster B disorder, which includes [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], and [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]]. These have an overall prevalence of 49.2 percent in people with BPD, with narcissistic being the most common, at 38.9 percent; antisocial the second most common, at 13.7 percent; and histrionic the least common, at 10.3 percent.&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"/&gt; The least common are Cluster C disorders, which include [[avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]], [[dependent personality disorder|dependent]], and [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder|obsessive-compulsive]], and have a prevalence of 29.9 percent in people with BPD.&lt;ref name="Grant et al 2008"/&gt; The percentages for specific comorbid Axis II disorders can be found in the adjacent table.

==Management==
{{Main|Management of borderline personality disorder}}
[[Psychotherapy]] is the primary treatment for borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name =Lei2011/&gt; Treatments should be based on the needs of the individual, rather than upon the general diagnosis of BPD. Medications are useful for treating comorbid disorders, such as depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG78/NiceGuidance/pdf/English |title=CG78 Borderline personality disorder (BPD): NICE guideline |publisher=Nice.org.uk |date=28 January 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411104754/http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG78/NiceGuidance/pdf/English |archivedate=11 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term hospitalization has not been found to be more effective than community care for improving outcomes or long-term prevention of suicidal behavior in those with BPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paris J |title=Is hospitalization useful for suicidal patients with borderline personality disorder? |journal=J.

Transference focused therapy aims to break away from absolute thinking. In this, it gets the people to articulate their social interpretations and their emotions in order to turn their views into less rigid categories. The therapist addresses the individual's feelings and goes over situations, real or realistic, that could happen as well as how to approach them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bliss|first=Susan|last2=McCardle|first2=Melissa|date=2014-03-01|title=An Exploration of Common Elements in Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Mentalization Based Treatment and Transference Focused Psychotherapy in the Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder|journal=Clinical Social Work Journal|language=en|volume=42|issue=1|pages=61–69|doi=10.1007/s10615-013-0456-z|issn=0091-1674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialectical behavior therapy has similar components to CBT, adding in practices such as meditation. In doing this, it helps the individual with BPD gain skills to manage symptoms. These skills include emotion regulation, mindfulness, and stress hardiness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Dialectical Behavior Therapy Cycle EN.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The stages used in [[dialectical behavior therapy]].]]
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is also a type of psychotherapy used for treatment of BPD. This type of therapy relies on changing people's behaviors and beliefs by identifying problems from the disorder. CBT is known to reduce some anxiety and mood symptoms as well as reduce suicidal thoughts and self-harming behaviors.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;

Mentalization-based therapy and transference-focused psychotherapy are based on [[psychodynamic]] principles, and dialectical behavior therapy is based on cognitive-behavioral principles and [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]].&lt;ref name=BPD_therapies/&gt; General psychiatric management combines the core principles from each of these treatments, and it is considered easier to learn and less intensive.&lt;ref name=Gund2011/&gt; Randomized controlled trials have shown that DBT and MBT may be the most effective, and the two share many similarities.&lt;ref name=DBT_vs_therapyByExperts&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Linehan MM, Comtois KA, Murray AM |title=Two-year randomized controlled trial and follow-up of dialectical behavior therapy vs therapy by experts for suicidal behaviors and borderline personality disorder |journal=Arch.

Some research indicates that mindfulness meditation may bring about favorable structural changes in the brain, including changes in brain structures that are associated with BPD.&lt;ref name="Mindfulness_neuroscience"&gt;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tang YY, Posner MI |title=Special issue on mindfulness neuroscience |journal= Social Cognitive &amp; Affective Neuroscience |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |date=Jan 2013 | doi=10.1093/scan/nss104 |pmid=22956677 |pmc=3541496 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mindfulness_mechanisms"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Posner MI, Tang YY, Lynch G |title= Mechanisms of white matter change induced by meditation training |journal= Frontiers in Psychology |volume=5 |issue=1220 |pages=297–302 |date=2014 | doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01220|pmid= 25386155 |pmc= 4209813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mindfulness_therapies"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chafos VH, Economou P |title= Beyond Borderline Personality Disorder: The Mindful Brain |journal= Social Work |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=297–302 |date=July 2014 | doi=10.1093/sw/swu030|pmid= 25365830 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness-based interventions also appear to bring about an improvement in symptoms characteristic of BPD, and some clients who underwent mindfulness-based treatment no longer met a minimum of five of the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for BPD.&lt;ref name="Mindfulness_therapies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mindfulness_BPD"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sachse S, Keville S, Feigenbaum J |title= A feasibility study of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for individuals with borderline personality disorder |journal= Psychology and Psychotherapy |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=184–200 |date=Jun 2011 | doi= 10.1348/147608310X516387|pmid= 22903856 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medications===
A 2010 review by the [[Cochrane collaboration]] found that no medications show promise for "the core BPD symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance and abandonment". However, the authors found that some medications may impact isolated symptoms associated with BPD or the symptoms of comorbid conditions.&lt;ref name=Stoffers&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stoffers|first1=J|last2=Völlm|first2=BA|last3=Rücker|first3=G|last4=Timmer|first4=A|last5=Huband|first5=N|last6=Lieb|first6=K|title=Pharmacological interventions for borderline personality disorder|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=16 June 2010|issue=6|pages=CD005653|pmid=20556762|pmc=4169794|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005653.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 review examined evidence published since the 2010 Cochrane review and found that "evidence of effectiveness of medication for BPD remains very mixed and is still highly compromised by suboptimal study design".&lt;ref name=Drugs2017rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hancock-Johnson|first1=E|last2=Griffiths|first2=C|last3=Picchioni|first3=M|title=A Focused Systematic Review of Pharmacological Treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder|journal=CNS Drugs|date=May 2017|volume=31|issue=5|pages=345–356|doi=10.1007/s40263-017-0425-0|pmid=28353141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the [[typical antipsychotic]]s studied in relation to BPD, [[haloperidol]] may reduce anger and [[flupenthixol]] may reduce the likelihood of suicidal behavior. Among the [[atypical antipsychotic]]s, one trial found that [[aripiprazole]] may reduce interpersonal problems and impulsivity.&lt;ref name=Stoffers/&gt; [[Olanzapine]] may decrease affective instability, anger, psychotic paranoid symptoms, and anxiety, but a [[placebo]] had a greater ameliorative impact on suicidal ideation than olanzapine did. The effect of [[ziprasidone]] was not significant.&lt;ref name=Stoffers/&gt;&lt;ref name=Drugs2017rev/&gt;

Of the [[mood stabilizers]] studied, [[valproate semisodium]] may ameliorate depression, interpersonal problems, and anger. [[Lamotrigine]] may reduce impulsivity and anger; [[topiramate]] may ameliorate interpersonal problems, impulsivity, anxiety, anger, and general psychiatric pathology. The effect of [[carbamazepine]] was not significant. Of the [[antidepressant]]s, [[amitriptyline]] may reduce depression, but [[mianserin]], [[fluoxetine]], [[fluvoxamine]], and [[phenelzine]] sulfate showed no effect. [[Omega-3 fatty acid]] may ameliorate suicidality and improve depression. {{as of|2017}}, trials with these medications had not been replicated and the effect of long-term use had not been assessed.&lt;ref name=Stoffers/&gt;&lt;ref name=Drugs2017rev/&gt;

Because of weak evidence and the potential for serious side effects from some of these medications, the UK [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) 2009 clinical guideline for the treatment and management of BPD recommends, "Drug treatment should not be used specifically for borderline personality disorder or for the individual symptoms or behavior associated with the disorder." However, "drug treatment may be considered in the overall treatment of comorbid conditions". They suggest a "review of the treatment of people with borderline personality disorder who do not have a diagnosed comorbid mental or physical illness and who are currently being prescribed drugs, with the aim of reducing and stopping unnecessary drug treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/12125/42900/42900.pdf|title=The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 2009 clinical guideline for the treatment and management of BPD|website=|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618094650/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/12125/42900/42900.pdf|archivedate=18 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Services===
There is a significant difference between the number of those who would benefit from treatment and the number of those who are treated. The so-called "treatment gap" is a function of the disinclination of the afflicted to submit for treatment, an underdiagnosing of the disorder by healthcare providers, and the limited availability and access to state-of-the-art treatments.&lt;ref name="BPD Article"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Johnson|first=R.

After a patient suffering from BPD died, The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service (NHS)]] in England was criticized by a coroner in 2014 for the lack of commissioned services to support those with BPD. Evidence was given that 45% of female patients had BPD and there was no provision or priority for therapeutic psychological services. At the time, there were 60 specialized inpatient beds in England, all of them located in London or the northeast region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National leaders warned over lack of services for personality disorders|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/mersey-care-nhs-trust/national-leaders-warned-over-lack-of-services-for-personality-disorders/7020669.article?|accessdate=22 December 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=29 September 2017}} {{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
With treatment, the majority of people with BPD can find relief from distressing symptoms and achieve remission, defined as a consistent relief from symptoms for at least two years.&lt;ref name=longitudinal_remission&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, Hennen J, Silk KR |title=A longitudinal course of borderline psychopathology: 6-year prospective follow-up of the phenomenology of borderline personality disorder |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=2 |pages=274–83 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12562573 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.2.274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PToverview/&gt; This [[longitudinal study]] tracking the symptoms of people with BPD found that 34.5% achieved remission within two years from the beginning of the study. Within four years, 49.4% had achieved remission, and within six years, 68.6% had achieved remission. By the end of the study, 73.5% of participants were found to be in remission.&lt;ref name=longitudinal_remission /&gt; Moreover, of those who achieved recovery from symptoms, only 5.9% experienced recurrences. A later study found that ten years from baseline (during a hospitalization), 86% of patients had sustained a stable recovery from symptoms.&lt;ref name=Treatment&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, Reich DB, Fitzmaurice G |title=Time to attainment of recovery from borderline personality disorder and stability of recovery: A 10-year prospective follow-up study |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=167 |issue=6 |pages=663–7 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20395399 |pmc=3203735 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2009.09081130 |laysummary=http://www.mclean.harvard.edu/news/press/current.php?kw=long-term-study-borderline-personality-disorder-shows-importance-measuring&amp;id=153 |laysource=McLean Hospital |laydate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patient personality can play an important role during the therapeutic process, leading to better clinical outcomes. Recent research has shown that BPD patients undergoing dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) exhibit better clinical outcomes correlated with higher levels of the trait of agreeableness in the patient, compared to patients either low in agreeableness or not being treated with DBT. This association was mediated through the strength of a working alliance between patient and therapist; that is, more agreeable patients developed stronger working alliances with their therapists, which in turn, led to better clinical outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirsh JB, Quilty LC, Bagby RM, McMain SF |title=The relationship between agreeableness and the development of the working alliance in patients with borderline personality disorder |journal=J. Pers. Disord. |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=616–27 |date=August 2012 |pmid=22867511 |doi=10.1521/pedi.2012.26.4.616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to recovering from distressing symptoms, people with BPD also achieve high levels of [[psychosocial]] functioning. A longitudinal study tracking the social and work abilities of participants with BPD found that six years after diagnosis, 56% of participants had good function in work and social environments, compared to 26% of participants when they were first diagnosed. Vocational achievement was generally more limited, even compared to those with other personality disorders. However, those whose symptoms had remitted were significantly more likely to have good relationships with a romantic partner and at least one parent, good performance at work and school, a sustained work and school history, and good psychosocial functioning overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zanarini MC, Frankenburg FR, Hennen J, Reich DB, Silk KR |title=Psychosocial functioning of borderline patients and axis II comparison subjects followed prospectively for six years |journal=J.

==History==
[[File:Edvard Munch - Salomé.jpg|thumb|Devaluation in [[Edvard Munch]]'s ''Salome'' (1903). Idealization and devaluation of others in personal relations is a common trait in BPD. The painter Edvard Munch depicted his new friend, the violinist Eva Mudocci, in both ways within days. First as "a woman seen by a man in love", then as "a bloodthirsty and [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[Salome]]".&lt;ref name=Ed1990&gt;{{cite book|title=Edvard Munch : the life of a person with borderline personality as seen through his art|date=1990|publisher=Lundbeck Pharma A/S|location=[Danmark]|isbn=978-8798352419|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, Munch has been diagnosed as having had BPD.&lt;ref&gt;[[James F. Masterson]]: ''Search For The Real Self. Unmasking The Personality Disorders Of Our Age'', Chapter 12: The Creative Solution: Sartre, Munch, and Wolfe, p. 208–230, Simon and Schuster, New York 1988, {{ISBN|1451668910}}, p. 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tove Aarkrog: ''Edvard Munch: the life of a person with borderline personality as seen through his art'', Lundbeck Pharma A/S, Denmark 1990, {{ISBN|8798352415}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The coexistence of intense, divergent moods within an individual was recognized by [[Homer]], [[Hippocrates]], and [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia|Aretaeus]], the latter describing the vacillating presence of impulsive anger, melancholia, and mania within a single person. The concept was revived by Swiss physician Théophile Bonet in 1684 who, using the term ''folie maniaco-mélancolique'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Millon|Grossman|Meagher|2004|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the phenomenon of unstable moods that followed an unpredictable course. Other writers noted the same pattern, including the American psychiatrist Charles H. Hughes in 1884 and J.C. Rosse in 1890, who called the disorder "borderline insanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|date=|year=1884|title=Borderline psychiatric records – prodromal symptoms of psychical impairments|url=|journal=Alienists &amp; Neurology|volume=5|pages=85–90|oclc=773814725|via=|author=Charles Hamilton Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, [[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin]] identified an "excitable personality" that closely parallels the borderline features outlined in the current concept of BPD.&lt;ref name="millon"&gt;{{Harvnb|Millon|1996|pp= 645–690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first significant psychoanalytic work to use the term "borderline" was written by Adolf Stern in 1938.&lt;ref name=stern&gt;{{Cite journal|first= Adolf |last= Stern |year= 1938 |title= Psychoanalytic investigation of and therapy in the borderline group of neuroses |journal= Psychoanalytic Quarterly |volume= 7 |pages= 467–489 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alberto&gt;{{Cite journal|first= Alberto |last= Stefana |year= 2015 |title= Adolph Stern, father of term 'borderline personality' |journal= Minerva Psichiatrica |volume= 56 |issue=2 |pages= 95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It described a group of patients suffering from what he thought to be a mild form of [[schizophrenia]], on the ''borderline'' between [[neurosis]] and [[psychosis]].

The 1960s and 1970s saw a shift from thinking of the condition as borderline schizophrenia to thinking of it as a borderline affective disorder (mood disorder), on the fringes of bipolar disorder, [[cyclothymia]], and [[dysthymia]]. In the [[DSM-II]], stressing the intensity and variability of moods, it was called [[cyclothymic personality]] (affective personality).&lt;ref name="DSM-IV-TR"/&gt; While the term "borderline" was evolving to refer to a distinct category of disorder, psychoanalysts such as [[Otto Kernberg]] were using it to refer to a broad [[Spectrum disorder|spectrum]] of issues, describing an intermediate level of personality organization&lt;ref name="millon"/&gt; between neurosis and psychosis.&lt;ref name=pmid3898174&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aronson TA |title=Historical perspectives on the borderline concept: a review and critique |journal=Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=209–22 |date=August 1985 |pmid=3898174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After standardized criteria were developed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gunderson JG, Kolb JE, Austin V |title=The diagnostic interview for borderline patients |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=138 |issue=7 |pages=896–903 |date=July 1981 |pmid=7258348 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=138&amp;page=896 |doi=10.1176/ajp.138.7.896}}&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish it from mood disorders and other Axis I disorders, BPD became a personality disorder diagnosis in 1980 with the publication of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III]].&lt;ref name="PToverview"&gt;{{cite web |last=Oldham |first1=John M. |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/borderline-personality-disorder-overview-0 |title=Borderline Personality Disorder: An Overview |work=Psychiatric Times |volume=XXI |issue=8 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021180803/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/borderline-personality-disorder-overview-0 |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis was distinguished from sub-syndromal schizophrenia, which was termed "[[Schizotypal personality disorder]]".&lt;ref name=pmid3898174/&gt; The DSM-IV Axis II Work Group of the American Psychiatric Association finally decided on the name "borderline personality disorder", which is still in use by the DSM-5 today.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; However, the term "borderline" has been described as uniquely inadequate for describing the symptoms characteristic of this disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Stone MH |year=2005 |chapter=Borderline Personality Disorder: History of the Concept |editor=Zanarini MC |title=Borderline personality disorder |pages=1–18 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=978-0-8247-2928-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Earlier versions of the DSM, prior to the multiaxial diagnosis system, classified most people with mental health problems into two categories, the psychotics and the neurotics. Clinicians noted a certain class of neurotics who, when in crisis, appeared to straddle the borderline into psychosis. The term stuck and evolved into the personality disorder diagnosis of today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moll |first1=Thomas |title=Mental Health Primer |isbn=978-1720510574 |page=43|date=2018-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Credibility and validity of testimony===
The credibility of individuals with personality disorders has been questioned at least since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Goodwin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodwin|first1=Jean|editor1-last=Kluft|editor1-first=Richard P.|title=Childhood antecedents of multiple personality|date=1985|publisher=American Psychiatric Press|isbn=9780880480826|url=9780880480826|chapter=Chapter 1: Credibility problems in multiple personality disorder patients and abused children}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Two concerns are the incidence of [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation episodes]] among people with BPD and the belief that lying is a key component of this condition.

====Dissociation====
Researchers disagree about whether [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], or a sense of detachment from emotions and physical experiences, impacts the ability of people with BPD to recall the specifics of past events. A 1999 study reported that the specificity of [[autobiographical memory]] was decreased in BPD patients.&lt;ref name="Startup"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Startup|first=M.|author2=B. Jones|author3=H. Heard|author4=M. Swales|author5=J.M.G. Williams|author6=R.S.P. Jones|title=Autobiographical memory and dissociation in borderline personality disorder|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=November 1999|volume=29|issue=6|pages=1397–1404|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=26157|doi=10.1017/S0033291799001208|pmid=10616945|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203061107/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=26157|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found that decreased ability to recall specifics was correlated with patients' levels of dissociation.&lt;ref name = "Startup" /&gt;

====Lying as a feature====
Some theorists argue that patients with BPD often [[lie]].&lt;ref name="Linehan 1993, p.17"&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others write that they have rarely seen lying among patients with BPD in clinical practice.&lt;ref name="Linehan 1993, p.17"/&gt;

The belief that lying is a distinguishing characteristic of BPD can impact the quality of care that people with this diagnosis receive in the legal and healthcare systems. For instance, Jean Goodwin relates an anecdote of a patient with multiple personality disorder, now called [[dissociative identity disorder]], who suffered from pelvic pain due to traumatic events in her childhood. Due to their disbelief in her accounts of these events, physicians diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder, reflecting a belief that lying is a key feature of BPD. Based upon her BPD diagnosis, the physicians then disregarded the patient's assertion that she was allergic to adhesive tape. The patient was in fact allergic to adhesive tape, which later caused complications in the surgery to relieve her pelvic pain.&lt;ref name=Goodwin/&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Gender===
Since BPD can be a [[#Stigma|stigmatizing]] diagnosis even within the mental health community, some survivors of childhood abuse who are diagnosed with BPD are re-traumatized by the negative responses they receive from healthcare providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nehls N |title=Borderline personality disorder: gender stereotypes, stigma, and limited system of care |journal=Issues Ment Health Nurs. |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=97–112 |year=1998 |pmid=9601307 |doi=10.1080/016128498249105}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; One camp argues that it would be better to diagnose these men or women with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], as this would acknowledge the impact of abuse on their behavior. Critics of the [[PTSD]] diagnosis argue that it medicalizes abuse rather than addressing the root causes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Becker D |title=When she was bad: borderline personality disorder in a posttraumatic age |journal=[[Am J Orthopsychiatry]] |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=422–32 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11086521 |doi=10.1037/h0087769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, a diagnosis of PTSD does not encompass all aspects of the disorder (see [[#Brain abnormalities|Brain abnormalities]] and [[#Terminology|Terminology]]).

Joel Paris states that "In the clinic ... Up to 80% of patients are women. That may not be true in the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paris J |title=Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder. A Guide to Evidence-Based Practice | year=2008 | publisher=The Guilford Press | page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He offers the following explanations regarding these gender discrepancies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most probable explanation for gender differences in clinical samples is that women are more likely to develop the kind of symptoms that bring patients in for treatment. Twice as many women as men in the community suffer from depression (Weissman &amp; Klerman, 1985). In contrast, there is a preponderance of men meeting criteria for substance abuse and psychopathy (Robins &amp; Regier, 1991), and males with these disorders do not necessarily present in the mental health system. Men and women with similar psychological problems may express distress differently. Men tend to drink more and carry out more crimes. Women tend to turn their anger on themselves, leading to depression as well as the cutting and overdosing that characterize BPD. Thus, [[anti-social personality disorder]] (ASPD) and borderline personality disorders might derive from similar underlying pathology but present with symptoms strongly influenced by gender (Paris, 1997a; Looper &amp; Paris, 2000).
&lt;br /&gt;
We have even more specific evidence that men with BPD may not seek help. In a study of completed suicides among people aged 18 to 35 years (Lesage et al., 1994), 30% of the suicides involved individuals with BPD (as confirmed by psychological autopsy, in which symptoms were assessed by interviews with family members). Most of the suicide completers were men, and very few were in treatment. Similar findings emerged from a later study conducted by our own research group (McGirr, Paris, Lesage, Renaud, &amp; Turecki, 2007).&lt;ref name="Paris J 2008 21–22"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In short, men are less likely to seek or accept appropriate treatment, more likely to be treated for symptoms of BPD such as substance abuse rather than BPD itself (the symptoms of BPD and ASPD possibly deriving from a similar underlying aetiology), possibly more likely to wind up in the correctional system due to criminal behavior, and possibly more likely to commit suicide prior to diagnosis.

Among men diagnosed with BPD there is also evidence of a higher suicide rate: "men are more than twice as likely as women—18 percent versus 8 percent"—to die by suicide.&lt;ref name="Kreisman J, Strauss H 2004 206"/&gt;

There are also sex differences in borderline personality disorders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender Patterns in Borderline Personality Disorder|journal = Innovations in Clinical Neuroscience|date = 1 May 2011|issn = 2158-8333|pmc = 3115767|pmid = 21686143|pages = 16–20|volume = 8|issue = 5|first = Randy A.|last = Sansone|first2 = Lori A.|last2 = Sansone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men with BPD are more likely to abuse substances, have explosive temper, high levels of novelty seeking and have [[Antisocial personality disorder|anti-social]], [[Narcissism|narcissistic]], passive-aggressive or sadistic personality traits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women with BPD are more likely to have eating disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and post-traumatic stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Manipulative behavior===
[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulative behavior]] to obtain nurturance is considered by the [[diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] and many mental health professionals to be a defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2000|page=705}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Marsha Linehan]] notes that doing so relies upon the assumption that people with BPD who communicate intense pain, or who engage in self-harm and suicidal behavior, do so with the intention of influencing the behavior of others.&lt;ref name = Linehanp14&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of such behavior on others—often an intense emotional reaction in concerned friends, family members, and therapists—is thus assumed to have been the person's intention.&lt;ref name = Linehanp14/&gt;

However, since people with BPD lack the ability to successfully manage painful emotions and interpersonal challenges, their frequent expressions of intense pain, self-harming, or suicidal behavior may instead represent a method of mood regulation or an escape mechanism from situations that feel unbearable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linehan notes that if, for example, one were to withhold pain medication from burn victims and cancer patients, leaving them unable to regulate their severe pain, they would also exhibit "attention-seeking" and [[self-destructive behavior]] in order to cope.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stigma===
The features of BPD include emotional instability; intense, unstable interpersonal relationships; a need for intimacy; and a fear of rejection. As a result, people with BPD often evoke intense emotions in those around them. Pejorative terms to describe people with BPD, such as "difficult", "treatment resistant", "manipulative", "demanding", and "[[attention seeking]]", are often used and may become a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the negative treatment of these individuals triggers further self-destructive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aviram RB, Brodsky BS, Stanley B |title=Borderline personality disorder, stigma, and treatment implications |journal=Harv Rev Psychiatry |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=249–56 |year=2006 |pmid=16990170 |doi=10.1080/10673220600975121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical violence====
The stigma surrounding borderline personality disorder includes the belief that people with BPD are prone to violence toward others.&lt;ref name=Chapman_31&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Gratz|2007|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While movies and visual media often sensationalize people with BPD by portraying them as violent, the majority of researchers agree that people with BPD are unlikely to physically harm others.&lt;ref name="Chapman_31"/&gt; Although people with BPD often struggle with experiences of intense anger, a defining characteristic of BPD is that they direct it inward toward themselves.&lt;ref name=Chapman_32&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Gratz|2007|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key differences between BPD and [[antisocial personality disorder]] (ASPD) is that people with BPD tend to internalize anger by hurting themselves, while people with ASPD tend to externalize it by hurting others.&lt;ref name=Chapman_32/&gt;

In addition, adults with BPD have often experienced abuse in childhood, so many people with BPD adopt a "no-tolerance" policy toward expressions of anger of any kind.&lt;ref name=Chapman_32/&gt; Their extreme aversion to violence can cause many people with BPD to overcompensate and experience difficulties being assertive and expressing their needs.&lt;ref name=Chapman_32/&gt; This is one way in which people with BPD choose to harm themselves over potentially causing harm to others.&lt;ref name=Chapman_32/&gt; Another way in which people with BPD avoid expressing their anger through violence is by causing physical damage to themselves, such as engaging in non-suicidal self-injury.&lt;ref name=reasons_NSSI /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapman_31"/&gt;

====Mental healthcare providers====

People with BPD are considered to be among the most challenging groups of patients to work with in therapy, requiring a high level of skill and training in the psychiatrists, therapists and nurses involved in their treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hinshelwood RD |title=The difficult patient. The role of 'scientific psychiatry' in understanding patients with chronic schizophrenia or severe personality disorder |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=174 |issue= 3|pages=187–90 |date=March 1999 |pmid=10448440 |doi=10.1192/bjp.174.3.187}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of psychiatric staff report finding individuals with BPD moderately to extremely difficult to work with and more difficult than other client groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cleary M, Siegfried N, Walter G |title=Experience, knowledge and attitudes of mental health staff regarding clients with a borderline personality disorder |journal=Int J Ment Health Nurs |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=186–91 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12510596 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-0979.2002.00246.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts are ongoing to improve public and staff attitudes toward people with BPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deans C, Meocevic E |title=Attitudes of registered psychiatric nurses towards patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder |journal=Contemp Nurse |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=43–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16594881 |doi=10.5172/conu.2006.21.1.43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krawitz R |title=Borderline personality disorder: attitudinal change following training |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=554–9 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15255829 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1614.2004.01409.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychoanalytic theory, the [[Stigma (sociological theory)|stigmatization]] among mental healthcare providers may be thought to reflect [[countertransference]] (when a therapist projects his or her own feelings on to a client). Thus, a diagnosis of BPD "often says more about the clinician's negative reaction to the patient than it does about the patient" and "explains away the breakdown in [[empathy]] between the therapist and the patient and becomes an institutional epithet in the guise of pseudoscientific jargon".&lt;ref name="pmid3898174" /&gt; This inadvertent countertransference can give rise to inappropriate clinical responses, including excessive use of medication, inappropriate mothering, and punitive use of limit setting and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vaillant GE |title=The beginning of wisdom is never calling a patient a borderline; or, the clinical management of immature defenses in the treatment of individuals with personality disorders |journal=J Psychother Pract Res |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=117–34 |year=1992 |pmid=22700090 |pmc=3330289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some clients feel the diagnosis is helpful, allowing them to understand that they are not alone and to connect with others with BPD who have developed helpful coping mechanisms. However, others experience the term ''borderline personality disorder'' as a [[pejorative]] [[labeling theory|label]] rather than an informative diagnosis. They report concerns that their self-destructive behavior is incorrectly perceived as manipulative and that the stigma surrounding this disorder limits their access to healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nehls N |title=Borderline personality disorder: the voice of patients |journal=Res Nurs Health |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=285–93 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10435546 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-240X(199908)22:4&lt;285::AID-NUR3&gt;3.0.CO;2-R}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=July 2015}} Indeed, mental health professionals frequently refuse to provide services to those who have received a BPD diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Manning_ix&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|2011|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
Because of the above concerns, and because of a move away from the original theoretical basis for the term (see [[Borderline personality disorder#History|history]]), there is ongoing debate about renaming borderline personality disorder. While some clinicians agree with the current name, others argue that it should be changed,&lt;ref name="borderlinepersonalitytoday.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bogod |first=Elizabeth |title=Borderline Personality Disorder Label Creates Stigma |url=http://www.borderlinepersonalitytoday.com/main/label.htm |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502181810/http://www.borderlinepersonalitytoday.com/main/label.htm |archivedate=2 May 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; since many who are [[labeling theory|labelled]] with borderline personality disorder find the name unhelpful, stigmatizing, or inaccurate.&lt;ref name="borderlinepersonalitytoday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tara4bpd.org/dyn/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12 |title=Understanding Borderline Personality Disorder |publisher=Treatment and Research Advancements Association for Personality Disorder |year=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526035257/http://www.tara4bpd.org/dyn/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12 |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Valerie Porr, president of Treatment and Research Advancement Association for Personality Disorders states that "the name BPD is confusing, imparts no relevant or descriptive information, and reinforces existing stigma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tara4bpd.org/dyn/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=35 |title=How Advocacy is Bringing Borderline Personality Disorder Into the Light |first=Valerie |last=Porr |year=2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020191907/http://www.tara4bpd.org/dyn/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=35 |archivedate=20 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative suggestions for names include ''emotional regulation disorder'' or ''[[emotional dysregulation]] disorder''. ''Impulse disorder'' and ''interpersonal regulatory disorder'' are other valid alternatives, according to [[John G. Gunderson]] of [[McLean Hospital]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gunderson |first1=John G. |last2=Hoffman |first2=Perry D. |title=Understanding and Treating Borderline Personality Disorder A Guide for Professionals and Families |location=Arlington, Virginia |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |year=2005}}{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another term suggested by psychiatrist Carolyn Quadrio is ''post traumatic personality disorganization'' (PTPD), reflecting the condition's status as (often) both a form of chronic [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) as well as a personality disorder.&lt;ref name="AxisOne/AxisTwo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Quadrio |first1=C |date=December 2005 |title=Axis One/Axis Two: A disordered borderline |journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry |volume=39 |pages=A97–A153 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1614.2005.01674_39_s1.x |url=http://med.unsw.edu.au/publication/axis-oneaxis-two-disordered-borderline |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130705153948/http://med.unsw.edu.au/publication/axis-oneaxis-two-disordered-borderline |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although many with BPD do have traumatic histories, some do not report any kind of traumatic event, which suggests that BPD is not necessarily a trauma spectrum disorder.&lt;ref name="Gratz2007" /&gt;

The Treatment and Research Advancements National Association for Personality Disorders (TARA-APD) campaigned unsuccessfully to change the name and designation of BPD in [[DSM-5]], published in May 2013, in which the name "borderline personality disorder" remains unchanged and it is not considered a trauma- and stressor-related disorder.&lt;ref name="DSM-5-borderline-663"&gt;{{harvnb|American Psychiatric Association|2013|pages=663–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Film and television===
Films and television shows have portrayed characters either explicitly diagnosed or with traits suggestive of BPD. These may be misleading if they are thought to depict this disorder accurately.&lt;ref name="Chapman_31" /&gt; The majority of researchers agree that in reality, people with BPD are very unlikely to harm others.&lt;ref name="Chapman_31"/&gt;

The films ''[[Play Misty for Me]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reel Psychiatry: Movie Portrayals of Psychiatric Conditions|author=Robinson, David J. |year= 2003|publisher=Rapid Psychler Press |location=Port Huron, Michigan |isbn=978-1-894328-07-4|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' (based on the [[Girl, Interrupted|memoir of the same name]]) both suggest the emotional instability of the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Movies and Mental Illness: Using Films to Understand Psychopathology |vauthors=Wedding D, Boyd MA, Niemiec RM |year=2005 |publisher=Hogrefe |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-88937-292-4 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1992 film ''[[Single White Female]],'' like the first example, also suggests characteristics, some of which are actually atypical of the disorder: the character Hedy had markedly disturbed sense of identity and reacts drastically to abandonment.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (''Reel Psychiatry: Movie Portrayals of Psychiatric Conditions''), p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the 2011 film ''[[Shame (2011 film)|Shame]]'' for the British journal ''The Art of Psychiatry'', another psychiatrist, Abby Seltzer, praises [[Carey Mulligan]]'s portrayal of a character with the disorder even though it is never mentioned onscreen.&lt;ref name="Art of Psychiatry Shame review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Seltzer|first=Abby|title=''Shame'' and ''A Dangerous Method'' reviews|url=http://www.artofpsychiatry.co.uk/shame-and-a-dangerous-method-reviews/|newspaper=The Art of Psychiatry|date=April 16, 2012|accessdate=January 13, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116164632/http://www.artofpsychiatry.co.uk/shame-and-a-dangerous-method-reviews/|archivedate=16 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films attempting to depict characters with the disorder include ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]'', ''[[Filth (film)|Filth]]'', ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'', ''[[The Crush (1993 film)|The Crush]]'', ''[[Mad Love (1995 film)|Mad Love]]'', ''[[Malicious (1996 film)|Malicious]]'', ''[[Interiors]]'', ''[[The Cable Guy]]'', ''[[Mr. Nobody (film)|Mr. Nobody]]'', ''[[Moksha (2001 film)|Moksha]]'', ''[[Cracks (film)|Cracks]]'',&lt;ref name="RobinsonFG"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Robinson|first = David J.| title = The Field Guide to Personality Disorders| publisher = Rapid Psychler Press| year = 1999| page =113| isbn = 978-0-9680324-6-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Welcome to Me]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = O'Sullivan | first = Michael | title = Kristen Wiig earns awkward laughs and silence in ‘Welcome to Me’ | newspaper = Washington Post | location =  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date = 7 May 2015 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/kristen-wiig-earns-awkward-laughs-and-silence-in-welcome-to-me/2015/05/06/c26d9b78-ef6d-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html | accessdate = 3 June 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150604082145/http://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/kristen-wiig-earns-awkward-laughs-and-silence-in-welcome-to-me/2015/05/06/c26d9b78-ef6d-11e4-8abc-d6aa3bad79dd_story.html | archivedate = 4 June 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chang | first = Justin | title = Toronto Film Review: ‘Welcome to Me’: Kristen Wiig plays a woman with borderline personality disorder in this startlingly inspired comedy from Shira Piven | newspaper = Variety | location =  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date = 11 September 2014 | url = https://variety.com/2014/film/festivals/toronto-film-review-welcome-to-me-1201304067/ | accessdate = 3 June 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150617215603/http://variety.com/2014/film/festivals/toronto-film-review-welcome-to-me-1201304067/ | archivedate = 17 June 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrists Eric Bui and Rachel Rodgers argue that the character of [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films meets six of the nine diagnostic criteria; Bui also found Anakin a useful example to explain BPD to medical students.

The '''capstan equation''' or '''belt friction equation''', also known as '''Eytelwein's formula''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atp.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/rt1/currentcourse/node57.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jrre.org/att_frict.pdf{{Dead link |date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; relates the hold-force to the load-force if a flexible line is wound around a cylinder (a [[bollard]], a [[winch]] or a [[Capstan (nautical)|capstan]]).&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = K.L. | title = Contact Mechanics | url = http://www.knovel.com/web/portal/browse/display?_EXT_KNOVEL_DISPLAY_bookid=2685 | format = PDF | accessdate = February 14, 2011 | year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the interaction of frictional forces and tension, the tension on a line wrapped around a capstan may be different on either side of the capstan.  A small ''holding'' force exerted on one side can carry a much larger ''loading'' force on the other side; this is the principle by which a capstan-type device operates.

A holding capstan is a ratchet device that can turn only in one direction; once a load is pulled into place in that direction, it can be held with a much smaller force.  A powered capstan, also called a winch, rotates so that the applied tension is multiplied by the friction between rope and capstan.  On a [[tall ship]] a holding capstan and a powered capstan are used in tandem so that a small force can be used to raise a heavy sail and then the rope can be easily removed from the powered capstan and tied off.

In [[rock climbing]] with so-called [[top-roping]], a lighter person can hold (belay) a heavier person due to this effect.

The formula is
:&lt;math&gt;T_\text{load} = T_\text{hold}\   e^{  \mu \phi} ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T_\text{load}&lt;/math&gt; is the applied tension on the line, &lt;math&gt;T_\text{hold}&lt;/math&gt; is the resulting force exerted at the other side of the capstan, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coefficient of friction]] between the rope and capstan materials, and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the total angle swept by all turns of the rope, measured in radians (i.e., with one full turn the angle &lt;math&gt;\phi =2\pi\,&lt;/math&gt;).

Several assumptions must be true for the formula to be valid:
# The rope is on the verge of full sliding, i.e. &lt;math&gt;T_\text{load}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum load that one can hold. Smaller loads can be held as well, resulting in a smaller ''effective'' contact angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.
# It is important that the line is not rigid, in which case significant force would be lost in the bending of the line tightly around the cylinder. (The equation must be modified for this case.) For instance a [[Bowden cable]] is to some extent rigid and doesn't obey the principles of the Capstan equation.
# The line is non-[[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]].

It can be observed that the force gain increases [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] with the coefficient of friction, the number of turns around the cylinder, and the angle of contact. Note that ''the radius of the cylinder has no influence on the force gain''.

The table below lists values of the factor &lt;math&gt;e^{  \mu \phi} \,&lt;/math&gt; based on the number of turns and coefficient of friction ''μ''.

From the table it is evident why one seldom sees a [[sheet (sailing)|sheet]] (a rope to the loose side of a sail) wound more than three turns around a winch. The force gain would be extreme besides being counter-productive since there is risk of a [[riding turn]], result being that the sheet will foul, form a knot and not run out when [[eased]] (by slacking grip on the [[tail]] (free end)).

It is both ancient and modern practice for anchor capstans and jib winches to be slightly flared out at the base, rather than cylindrical, to prevent the rope ([[Anchor#Anchor Warps|anchor warp]] or sail sheet) from sliding down. The rope wound several times around the winch can slip upwards gradually, with little risk of a riding turn, provided it is [[tailed]] (loose end is pulled clear), by hand or a self-tailer.

For instance, the factor "153,552,935" (5 turns around a capstan with a coefficient of friction of 0.6) means, in theory, that a newborn baby would be capable of holding (not moving) the weight of two {{USS|Nimitz|CVN-68|6}} supercarriers (97,000 tons each, but for the baby it would be only a little more than 1&amp;nbsp;kg).  The large number of turns around the capstan combined with such a high friction coefficient mean that very little additional force is necessary to hold such heavy weight in place.  The cables necessary to support this weight, as well as the capstan's ability to withstand the crushing force of those cables, are separate considerations.

== Derivation of the capstan equation ==
[[File:Capstan force diagram 4.jpg|thumb|right| Forces between a rope and capstan]]

The first step is to relate the radial or normal force &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt;(Newtons/radian) at any point of the rope wrapped around a capstan to the tension &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt;(Newtons) in the rope as shown in the figure.  The y axis component of the upward force of the capstan on the rope, &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt;, must equal the Y axis downward component of the tension in the rope, &lt;math&gt; T_\text{hold} \sin(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; F  = T_\text{hold} \sin (\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit as &lt;math&gt; \varphi&lt;/math&gt; goes to zero (the [[small-angle approximation]]), &lt;math&gt; \sin(d\varphi)= d\varphi &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_\text{hold} = T_\text{load}  = T &lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt; F=T d\varphi &lt;/math&gt;

So the frictional force over a wrap angle &lt;math&gt; d\varphi &lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; \mu {F}  = \mu {T} d\varphi  &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of friction (nonslip).

The increase in rope tension &lt;math&gt; dT &lt;/math&gt; over a wrap angle &lt;math&gt; d\varphi &lt;/math&gt; is the frictional force over that angle so

:&lt;math&gt;   dT=\mu {T} d\varphi   &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;   \frac{1}{T}dT=\mu d\varphi   &lt;/math&gt;

Integration of both sides yields

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{T_\text{hold}}^{T_\text{load}} \frac{1}{T} \;{dT} = \int_0^\phi \mu \; {d}\varphi&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\ln T_\text{load} - \ln T_\text{hold} = \ln\frac{T_\text{load}}{T_\text{hold}} = \mu \phi&lt;/math&gt;

and exponentiating both sides,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{T_\text{load}}{T_\text{hold}}={e}^{\mu \phi}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally,

: &lt;math&gt; T_\text{load} = T_\text{hold}{e}^{\mu \phi} &lt;/math&gt;

== Generalization of the Capstan equation for a V-belt ==

The belt friction equation for a v-belt is:

: &lt;math&gt; T_\text{load} = T_\text{hold}{e}^{\mu \phi / \sin( \alpha / 2 )} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the angle (in radians) between the two flat sides of the pulley that the v-belt presses against.&lt;ref name="moradmand"/&gt; A flat belt has an effective angle of &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \pi&lt;/math&gt;.

The material of a [[v-belt]] or multi-v [[serpentine belt]] tends to wedge into the mating groove in a pulley as the load increases, improving torque transmission.&lt;ref&gt;

page 5-9.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For the same power transmission, a V-belt requires less tension than a flat belt, increasing bearing life.&lt;ref name="moradmand"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalization of the Capstan equation for a rope lying on an arbitrary orthotropic surface ==
If a rope is lying in equilibrium under tangential forces on a rough orthotropic surface then all three following conditions are satisfied:

1. No separation – normal reaction &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is positive for all points of the rope curve:

&lt;math&gt;N=-k_nT&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_n&lt;/math&gt; is a normal curvature of the rope curve.

2. Dragging coefficient of friction &lt;math&gt;\mu_g&lt;/math&gt; and angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are satisfying the following criteria for all points of the curve

&lt;math&gt;-\mu_g&lt;\tan \alpha &lt;+\mu_g&lt;/math&gt;

3. Limit values of the tangential forces:

The forces at both ends of the rope &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; are satisfying the following inequality

&lt;math&gt;T_0 e^{-\int_s \omega ds}\le T \le T_0 e^{\int_s \omega ds}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\omega = \mu_\tau \sqrt{ k_n^2 - \frac{k_g^2}{\mu_g^2}}=\mu_\tau k \sqrt{ \cos^2 \alpha - \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\mu_g^2}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;k_g&lt;/math&gt;is a [[geodesic curvature]] of the rope curve, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a curvature of a rope curve, &lt;math&gt;\mu_\tau&lt;/math&gt;is a coefficient of friction in the tangential direction.

If &lt;math&gt;\omega = const&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;T_0 e^{-\mu_\tau k s \, \sqrt{ \cos^2 \alpha - \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\mu_g^2}}}\le T \le T_0 e^{\mu_\tau k s \, \sqrt{ \cos^2 \alpha - \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\mu_g^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''''Castles &amp; Crusades''''' ('''''C&amp;C''''') is a fantasy role-playing game published in 2004 by [[Troll Lord Games]] based upon a stripped-down variant of the [[d20 System]] by [[Wizards of the Coast]]. The game system is designed to emulate the play of earlier editions of the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' game while keeping the unified mechanics of the d20 System.

==History==
[[Image:Cncboxedset.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Box cover for ''Castles &amp; Crusades'' Collectors Edition]]
The name of the game derives from the Castle &amp; Crusade Society, founded in the pre-''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' era by [[Gary Gygax]].&lt;ref name=BleedingCool&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/05/18/looking-back-and-looking-forward-castles-and-crusades-from-troll-lord-games/ |title=Looking Back And Looking Forward: Castles &amp; Crusades From Troll Lord Games |last=Helton |first=Christopher |date=May 18, 2014 |website=Bleeding Cool |publisher=Bleeding Cool |access-date=April 12, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title is in homage to the role-playing industry's birth.

The game was initially released in 2004 in a special boxed edition consisting of three digest-sized booklets, dice, and a crayon in a white box with artwork by artist Peter Bradley of a [[knight]] on horseback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chenault|first1=Davis|last2=Golden|first2=Mac|title=Castles &amp; Crusades: A Guide &amp; Rules System for Fantasy Role Playing (Collector's Edition)|date=2004|publisher=Troll Lord Games|location=Little Rock, AR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the box set was to have something on hand for sale at [[Gen Con]] as the finished product was still several months away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chenault|first1=Stephen|title=Castles &amp; Crusades Black Box Collector's Edition|date=2014|publisher=Troll Lord Games|location=Little Rock, AR}}&lt;/ref&gt; A boxed set was chosen for its resemblance to the [[Editions_of_Dungeons_&amp;_Dragons|earliest versions of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'']],&lt;ref name=BlackGate&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blackgate.com/2013/08/18/the-exploding-world-of-castles-and-crusades/ |title=The Exploding World of Castles and Crusades |last=ONeill |first=John |date=August 13, 2013 |website=Black Gate |publisher=Black Gate |access-date=April 12, 2018 |quote=Troll Lord’s recent Castles and Crusades releases get my highest recommendation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could be found, depending upon printing, in either a woodgrain box or a white one. As a promotion through the company's website, the first 300 copies were signed and numbered by the designers. 

Later that year, the first printing of the ''Players Handbook'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chenault|first1=Davis|last2=Golden|first2=Mac|title=Castles &amp; Crusades Player's Handbook|date=2004|publisher=Troll Lord Games|location=Little Rock, AR|isbn=9781931275606|edition=First Printing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, the ''Players Handbook'' has seen additional reprints, in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2012, and 2014. The companion volume, ''Monsters &amp; Treasure'', was released in 2005, with additional reprints published in 2007, 2009 and 2015. The ''Castle Keeper's Guide'' was published in 2010, with a second printing in 2015.

==System==
''Castles &amp; Crusades''{{'}}s game mechanics are based on the [[d20 system]], designed by Wizards of the Coast. The system has been modified to create a simplified version of the game. All the core [[Character class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|classes]] and [[Race (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|races]], the [[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignment]] system, [[Attribute (role-playing games)|attributes]] and [[hit points]] systems were retained with only slight adjustments in hit dice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chenault|first1=Davis|last2=Golden|first2=Mac|title=Castles &amp; Crusades Player's Handbook|date=2017|publisher=Troll Lord Games|location=Little Rock, AR|isbn=978-1944135515|page=17-57|edition=7th Printing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly intricate system of skills and feats found in ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3rd edition was discarded, replaced by what the designers call the "Siege Engine", intended as an extremely easy game mechanic with universal applications. The game is compliant with the terms of the [[Open Game License]].  The game was later nominated for a 2005 ENnie Award for Best d20 Game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/about-us/2005-noms-and-winners/ |title=ENnies 2005 Noms and Winners |date= |website=ENNies 2005 Nom and Winners |publisher=ENNies |access-date=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Siege Engine works on an attribute check system. A character's attributes are divided into primary and secondary attributes. Checks made against primary attributes have a base Challenge Base (or target number; abbreviated "CB") of 12, while secondary attributes have a CB of 18. The game's referee, the Castle Keeper, adds a challenge level (usually from 1-10, depending on task difficulty) to the CB and the resulting number, the challenge class or CC, is the final target number required to succeed at a check. The player adds the character's level, any attribute bonuses and class bonuses to the roll of a twenty-sided die. If the result after bonuses equals or exceeds the challenge class, the player succeeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chenault|first1=Davis|last2=Golden|first2=Mac|title=Castles &amp; Crusades Player's Handbook|date=2017|publisher=Troll Lord Games|location=Little Rock, AR|isbn=978-1944135515|page=16|edition=7th Printing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for combat, the Siege Engine is used for anything that requires a check in the game.&lt;ref name="BleedingCool" /&gt;

While the first two printings of the ''Players Handbook'' were virtually identical with the exception of a change in font for the headers, the third printing introduced a replacement barbarian class. The 4th printing introduced an expansion to the illusionist written by [[James M. Ward]] that allowed the illusionist to heal others. The current printing introduces a streamlined replacement to the game's encumbrance rules for faster play.

==Setting==
The core books of the game are setting-agnostic. While players can set the adventure in any setting they wish, some settings have been published for the game.

;Aihrde
:Once named Erde, Aihrde is Troll Lord Games' home setting. Originally a setting for use with ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', a summary of the setting was originally available in the ''World of Aihrde Folio''. Books like ''The Free City of Eskadia'' expand on the setting by covering sections in more detail. A full campaign setting, ''The Codex of Aihrde,'' was released in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chenault|first1=Stephen|title=Codex of Aihrde|date=2015|publisher=Troll Lord Games|location=Little Rock, AR|isbn=978-1936822416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bluffside
:Troll Lord Games' second setting for ''Castles &amp; Crusades'', Bluffside is a conversion and expansion of an earlier product released by [[Thunderhead Games]]. Bluffside is designed to be placed anywhere the player desires in their existing campaign, or it can be used as a campaign setting on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Govreau|first1=James|last2=Bennett|first2=Curtis|last3=Troman|first3=Andrew|last4=Quinn|first4=Jeff|last5=Bailey|first5=Warren|last6=et. al.|title=Bluffside: City on the Edge|date=2013|publisher=Troll Lord Games|location=Little Rock, AR|isbn=978-1936822560|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Haunted Highlands
:Troll Lord Games' third setting for ''Castles &amp; Crusades'', introduced with the "DB" series of adventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chrostofferson|first1=Casey W.|title=Player's Guide to the Haunted Highlands|date=2013|publisher=Troll Lord Games|location=Little Rock, AR|isbn=978-1936822690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coolness''' is an [[aesthetic]] of attitude, behavior, comportment, appearance and style which is generally admired. Because of the varied and changing connotations of cool, as well as its subjective nature, the word has no single meaning. It has associations of composure and self-control (cf. the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] definition) and often is used as an expression of admiration or approval.  Although commonly regarded as [[slang]], it is widely used among disparate social groups and has endured in usage for generations.

==Overview==
[[File:Timeline of cool.svg|thumb|410px|A timeline of cool, adapted from Dick Pountain and David Robins, ''Cool Rules: Anatomy of an Attitude'']] There is no single concept of cool. One consistent aspect however, is that cool is widely seen as desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Warren &amp; Campbell, 'What Makes Things Cool? How Autonomy Influences Perceived Coolness.’ Article by Caleb Warren and Margaret C. Campbell; Journal of Consumer Research, Vol. 41, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerner, Noah and Gene Pressman (2007), 'Chasing Cool: Standing out in Today's Cluttered Marketplace,' New York: Atria&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although there is no single concept of cool, its definitions fall into a few broad categories.

=== As a behavioral characteristic ===
The sum and substance of cool is a [[self-conscious]] aplomb in overall behavior, which entails a set of specific [[behavior]]al characteristics that is firmly anchored in [[symbology]], a set of discernible [[Body language|bodily movements]], [[Human position|postures]], [[facial expression]]s and [[voice]] modulations that are acquired and take on strategic social value within the peer context.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Marcel Danesi, ''Cool - The Signs and Meanings of Adolescence'', University of Toronto Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cool was once an attitude fostered by rebels and underdogs, such as slaves, prisoners, bikers and political dissidents, etc., for whom open rebellion invited punishment, so it hid defiance behind a wall of ironic detachment, distancing itself from the source of authority rather than directly confronting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pountain|first1=Dick|last2=Robbins|first2=David|year=2000|title=Cool Rules|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1-86189-071-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, coolness is a positive trait based on the inference that a cultural object (e.g., a person or brand) is autonomous in an appropriate way. That is the person or brand is not constrained by the norms, expectation of beliefs of others.&lt;ref&gt;Warren &amp; Campbell, 'What Makes Things Cool? How Autonomy Influences Perceived Coolness.’ Article by Caleb Warren and Margaret C. Campbell; Journal of Consumer Research, Vol. 41, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As a state of being ===
Cool has been used to describe a general state of well-being, a transcendent, internal state of peace and serenity.&lt;ref name="Aesthetic"&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3334749 An Aesthetic of the Cool]'' Robert Farris Thompson African Arts, Vol. 7, No. 1 (Autumn, 1973), pp. 40-43+64-67+89-91&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to an absence of conflict, a state of harmony and balance as in, "The land is cool," or as in a "cool [spiritual] heart." Such meanings, according to Thompson, are African in origin. Cool is related in this sense to both social control and transcendental balance.&lt;ref name="Aesthetic"/&gt;

Cool can similarly be used to describe composure and absence of excitement in a person—especially in times of stress—as expressed in the [[idiom]] ''to keep your cool''.

In a related way, the word can be used to express agreement or assent, as in the phrase ''"I'm cool with that".''

=== As aesthetic appeal ===
Cool is also an attitude widely adopted by artists and intellectuals, who thereby aided its infiltration into [[popular culture]]. Sought by product marketing firms, idealized by teenagers, a shield against racial oppression or political persecution and source of constant cultural innovation, cool has become a global phenomenon that has spread to every corner of the earth.&lt;ref name="coolhunt"&gt;''Coolhunting With Aristotle Welcome to the hunt.'' by Nick Southgate, Cogent&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts of cool have existed for centuries in several cultures.&lt;ref name="Pountain"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cool Rules: Anatomy of an Attitude|last1=Pountain|first1=Dick|last2=Robins|first2=David|publisher=Reaktion Book Ltd.|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As fashion===
In terms of fashion, the concept of "cool" has transformed from the 1960s to the 1990s by becoming integrated in the dominant fabric of culture. America’s mass-production of "ready-to-wear" fashion in the 1940s and ‘50s, established specific conventional outfits as markers of ones fixed social role in society. Subcultures such as the Hippies, felt repressed by the dominating conservative ideology of the 1940s and ‘50s towards conformity and rebelled. According to Dick Pountain’s definition of "cool," Hippie's fashionable dress can be seen as "cool" because of its prominent deviation away from the standard uniformity of dress and mass-production of dress, created by the totalitarian system of fashion was seen as "cool."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pountain|first=Dick|title=Cool Rules: Anatomy of an Attitude |date=2000|publisher=Reaktion|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had various different styles that features bold colors such as the "Trippy Hippie," the "Fantasy Hippie," the "Retro Hippie," the "Ethnic Hippie," and the "Craft Hippie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitley|first=Lauren D.|title=Hippie Chic|date=2013|publisher=MFA Publications |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, according to the strain theory, Hippie’s hand production of their clothing makes them "cool." By naturally hand-making their clothing they rebelled against consumerism in a passive manner because it allowed them to simply not participate in that lifestyle, which makes them "cool." As a result of their disengagement, the scope of self-critique was limited because their mask filtered negative thoughts of worthlessness, fostering the opportunity for self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pountain|first=Dick|title=Cool Rules: Anatomy of an Attitude|date=2000|publisher=Reaktion|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Starting in the 1990s and continuing into the 21st century, the concept of dressing cool went out of the minority and into the mainstream culture, making dressing "cool" a dominant ideology. Cool entered the mainstream because those Hippie "rebels" of the late 1960s were now senior executives of business sectors and of the fashion industry. Since they grew up with "cool" and maintained the same values, they knew its rules and thus knew how to accurately market and produce such clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pountain|first=Dick|title=Cool Rules: Anatomy of an Attitude|date=2000|publisher=Reaktion|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once "cool" became the dominant ideology in the 21st century its definition changed to not one of rebellion but of one attempting to hide their insecurities in a confident manner. 

The "fashion-grunge" style of the 1990s and 21st century allowed people who felt financially insecure about their lifestyle to pretend to "fit in" by wearing a unique piece of clothing, but one that was polished beautiful. For example, unlike the Hippie style that clearly diverges from the norm, through Marc Jacobs' combined "fashion-grunge" style of "a little preppie, a little grunge and a little couture," he produces not a bold statement one that is mysterious and awkward creating an ambiguous perception of what the wearer’s internal feelings are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Marc_Jacobs|title=Marc Jacobs|publisher=Voguepedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an epithet===
While [[slang]] terms are usually short-lived coinages and figures of speech, ''cool'' is an especially ubiquitous slang word, most notably among young people. As well as being understood throughout the English-speaking world, the word has even entered the vocabulary of several languages other than English.

In this sense, cool is used as a general positive [[epithet]] or interjection, which can have a range of related adjectival [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]]s.

==Regions==
One of the essential characteristics of cool is its mutability&amp;mdash;what is considered cool changes over time and varies among cultures and generations. &lt;ref name="Pountain" /&gt;

===Africa and the African diaspora===
[[File:Yoruba-bronze-head.jpg|thumb|[[Yoruba Culture|Yoruba]] bronze head sculpture from the city of [[Ife]], [[Nigeria]] c. 12th century A.D]]

Author [[Robert Farris Thompson]], professor of [[History of art|art history]] at [[Yale University]], suggests that [[Itutu]], which he translates as 'mystic coolness,'&lt;ref&gt;Flash of the Spirit, Random House 1984, {{ISBN|0-394-72369-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of three pillars of a religious philosophy created in the 15th century&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westafricaarticles.info/Article/The-Benin-Empire/221 The Benin Empire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080859/http://www.westafricaarticles.info/Article/The-Benin-Empire/221 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Igbo people|Igbo]] civilizations of West Africa. Cool, or Itutu, contained meanings of conciliation and gentleness of character, of generosity and grace, and the ability to defuse fights and disputes. It also was associated with physical beauty. In Yoruba culture, Itutu is connected to water, because to the Yoruba the concept of coolness retained its physical connotation of temperature.&lt;ref name="art"&gt;Robert Farris Thompson, ''African Art in Motion'', New York, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; He cites a definition of cool from the [[Gola (ethnic group)|Gola]] people of [[Liberia]], who define it as the ability to be mentally calm or detached, in an other-worldly fashion, from one's circumstances, to be nonchalant in situations where emotionalism or eagerness would be natural and expected.&lt;ref name="Aesthetic" /&gt; Joseph M. Murphy writes that "cool" is also closely associated with the deity [[Oshun|Òsun]] of the [[Yoruba religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Joseph, M. and Sanford, Mei-Mei. ''Òsun Across the Waters: A Yoruba Goddess in Africa and the Americas'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Thompson acknowledges similarities between African and European ''cool'' in shared notions of self-control and imperturbability,&lt;ref name="art" /&gt; he finds the cultural value of cool in Africa which influenced the [[African diaspora]] to be different from that held by Europeans, who use the term primarily as the ability to remain calm under stress. According to Thompson, there is significant weight, meaning and spirituality attached to cool in traditional African cultures, something which, Thompson argues, is absent from the idea in a Western context.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The telling point is that the "mask" of coolness is worn not only in time of stress, but also of pleasure, in fields of expressive performance and the dance. Struck by the re-occurrence of this vital notion elsewhere in tropical Africa and in the [[Americas|Pan-American]] [[African Diaspora]], I have come to term the attitude "an aesthetic of the cool" in the sense of a deeply and completely motivated, consciously artistic, interweaving of elements serious and pleasurable, of responsibility and play.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Robert Farris. ''African Arts''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====African Americans====
Ronald Perry writes that many words and expressions have passed from [[African-American Vernacular English]] into Standard English slang including the contemporary meaning of the word "cool."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utp.edu.co/~chumanas/revistas/revistas/rev31/african.htm African-American English]&lt;/ref&gt; The definition, as something fashionable, is said to have been popularized in jazz circles by tenor saxophonist [[Lester Young]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cool Cool - Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; This predominantly [[Black people|black]] jazz scene in the U.S. and among expatriate musicians in [[Paris]] helped popularize notions of cool in the U.S. in the 1940s, giving birth to "Bohemian", or [[beatnik]], culture.&lt;ref name="coolhunt"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, a style of jazz called [[cool jazz]] appeared on the music scene, emphasizing a restrained, laid-back solo style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/index/n2575213m0lx0618.pdf Music of the African Diaspora in the Americas]&lt;/ref&gt; Notions of cool as an expression of centeredness in a [[Tao]]ist sense, equilibrium and self-possession, of an absence of conflict are commonly understood in both African and African-American contexts well. Expressions such as, "Don't let it blow your cool," later, ''chill out'', and the use of ''chill'' as a characterization of inner contentment or restful repose all have their origins in African-American Vernacular English.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Lee, "Out of the Hood and into the News: Borrowed Black Verbal Expressions in a Mainstream Newspaper" (conference paper, University of Georgia, October 1998); cited in Rickford and Rickford, ''Spoken Soul,'' 98.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; When the air in the smoke-filled nightclubs of that era became unbreathable, windows and doors were opened to allow some "cool air" in from the outside to help clear away the suffocating air. By analogy, the slow and smooth jazz style that was typical for that late-night scene came to be called "cool".&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Danesi, ''Cool - The Signs and Meanings of Adolescence'', University of Toronto Press, 1994, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The purpose of the cool [[jazz]] as Giogia stated, "The goal was always the same: to lower the temperature of the music and bring out different qualities in jazz." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jazz.com |title=A History of Cool Jazz in 100 Tracks |accessdate=23 October 2015 |website=jazz |publisher=jazz |last=Gioia |first=Ted |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021131326/http://www.jazz.com/ |archivedate=21 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marlene Kim Connor connects cool and the post-war African-American experience in her book ''What is Cool?: Understanding Black Manhood in America''. Connor writes that cool is the silent and knowing rejection of racist oppression, a self-dignified expression of masculinity developed by black men denied mainstream expressions of manhood. She writes that mainstream perception of cool is narrow and distorted, with cool often perceived merely as style or arrogance, rather than a way to achieve respect.&lt;ref&gt;''Conner, Marlene Kim (1995).

Among black men in America, coolness, which may have its roots in slavery as an ironic submission and concealed subversion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/80/What_Does_It_Mean_To_Be_Cool |title=What Does it Mean to Be Cool? |last=Botz-Bornstein|first=Thorsten  |date=2010 |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at times is enacted in order to create a powerful appearance, a type of performance frequently maintained for the sake of a social audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Majors |first1=Richard |date=1992 |title=

'Cool', though an amorphous quality—more mystique than material—is a pervasive element in urban black male culture.&lt;ref name="Cool Politics" /&gt; Majors and Billson address what they term "cool pose" in their study and argue that it helps black men counter stress caused by social oppression, rejection and [[racism]]. They also contend that it furnishes the black male with a sense of control, strength, confidence and stability and helps him deal with the closed doors and negative messages of the "generalized other." They also believe that attaining black manhood is filled with pitfalls of discrimination, negative self-image, guilt, shame and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Boddie, Jacquelyn Lynette.

"Cool pose" may be a factor in discrimination in education contributing to the [[racial achievement gap in the United States|achievement gaps in test scores]]. In a 2004 study, researchers found that teachers perceived students with African-American culture-related movement styles, referred to as the "cool pose," as lower in achievement, higher in aggression, and more likely to need [[Special education in the United States|special education]] services than students with standard movement styles, irrespective of race or other academic indicators.&lt;ref&gt;''The Effects of African American Movement Styles on Teachers' Perceptions and Reactions'' Journal article by Scott T. Bridgest, Audrey Davis Mccray, La Vonne I. Neal, Gwendolyn Webb-Johnson; ''Journal of Special Education'', Vol. 37, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of stereotyping and discrimination with respect to "cool pose" raises complex questions of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and accommodation of different cultural values. Jason W. Osborne identifies "cool pose" as one of the factors in black underachievement.&lt;ref&gt;Jason W. Osborne, "Unraveling Underachievement among African American Boys from an Identification with Academics Perspective", ''The Journal of Negro Education'', Vol. 68, No. 4 (Autumn 1999), pp. 555-565. {{doi|10.2307/2668154}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robin D. G. Kelley]] criticizes calls for assimilation and sublimation of black culture, including "cool pose." He argues that media and academics have unfairly demonized these aspects of black culture while, at the same time, through their sustained fascination with blacks as exotic others, appropriated aspects of "cool pose" into the broader popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Robin D. G. Kelley, ''Yo' Mama's Disfunktional!: Fighting the Culture Wars in Urban America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Elliott Clarke]] writes that [[Malcolm X]], like [[Miles Davis]], embodies essential elements of cool. As an icon, Malcolm X inspires a complex mixture of both fear and fascination in broader American culture, much like "cool pose" itself.&lt;ref name="Cool Politics"/&gt;

===East Asia===
{{main|Cool Japan}}
In Japan, synonyms of "cool" could be [[iki (aesthetic ideal)|iki]] and sui. These are traditional commoners' aesthetic ideals that developed in Edo. Some tend to immediately connect the aesthetics of Japan to samurai, but this is historically inaccurate. In fact, samurais from the countryside have often been the target of ridicule by the commoner in the civilized Edo in many art forms including [[rakugo]], a form of comical storytelling.

Some argue that the ethic of the [[Samurai]] caste in [[Japan]], warrior castes in India and East Asia all resemble cool.&lt;ref name="Pountain"/&gt; The samurai-themed works of film director [[Akira Kurosawa]] are among the most praised of the genre, influencing many filmmakers across the world with his techniques and storytelling. Notable works of his include ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', and ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]''. The latter was one of the primary inspirations for [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'', which also borrows a number of aspects from the samurai, for example the [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]] of the series. Samurai have been presented as cool in many modern Japanese movies such as ''[[Samurai Fiction]]'', ''[[Kagemusha]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivefilms.com/Samurai_Classics.21/Criterion_Collection.6/kagemushadvd.1206.html |title=Kagemusha|publisher=Olive Films|accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Yojimbo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=1511 |title=Apollo Movie Guide's Review of Yojimbo |publisher=Apolloguide.com |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was appropriated in American movies such as ''[[Ghost Dog]]''&lt;ref&gt;Way cool way of the samurai, Bruce Kirkland, [http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Reviews/G/Ghost_Dog/2000/03/10/752999.html Canoe.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Last Samurai]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kfccinema.com/reviews/swordplay/lastsamurai/lastsamurai.html The Last Samurai Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070119170705/http://www.kfccinema.com/reviews/swordplay/lastsamurai/lastsamurai.html |date=2007-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[The Art of War]], a Chinese military treatise written during the 6th century BC, general [[Sun Tzu]], a member of the landless Chinese aristocracy, wrote in Chapter XII:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Profiting by their panic, we shall exterminate them completely; this will cool the King's courage and cover us with glory, besides ensuring the success of our mission.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Shibuya tokyo.jpg|thumb|Prof. [[Paul Waley]] considers Tokyo one of the world's "capitals of cool."]]
Asian countries have developed a tradition on their own to explore types of modern 'cool' or 'ambiguous' [[aesthetics]].

In a ''[[Time Asia]]'' article "The Birth of Cool" author [[Hannah Beech]] describes Asian cool as "a revolution in taste led by style gurus who are redefining Chinese craftsmanship in everything from architecture and film to clothing and cuisine" and as a modern aesthetic inspired both by a Ming-era minimalism and a strenuous attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beech |first=Hannah |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/china_cul_rev/trendintro.html |title=TIME Asia: China's Next Cultural Revolution &amp;#124; The Birth of Cool |publisher=Time.com |date= 2002-11-11|accessdate=2008-11-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224180436/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/china_cul_rev/trendintro.html|archivedate=2007-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Waley]], professor of Human Geography at the University of Leeds, considers [[Tokyo]] along with New York, London and Paris to be one of the world's "capitals of cool"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glocom.org/books_and_journals/journal_abstracts/20070122_ja_s265/index.html |title=GLOCOM Platform - Books &amp; Journals - Journal Abstracts |publisher=Glocom.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Washington Post]]'' called Tokyo "Japan's Empire of Cool" and Japan "the coolest nation on Earth".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Analysts are marveling at the breadth of a recent explosion in cultural exports, and many argue that the international embrace of Japan's pop culture, film, food, style and arts is second only to that of the United States. Business leaders and government officials are now referring to Japan's "gross national cool" as a new engine for economic growth and societal buoyancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A33261-2003Dec26 |title= Japan's Empire of Cool |date= 2003-12-27|accessdate=2008-11-27 | work=The Washington Post | first=Anthony | last=Faiola}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term "gross national cool" was coined by Journalist Douglas McGray. In a June/July 2002 article in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japansociety.org/web_docs/grossnationalcool.pdf Japan Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003154021/http://www.japansociety.org/web_docs/grossnationalcool.pdf |date=October 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he argued that as Japan's economic juggernaut took a wrong turn into a 10-year slump, and with military power made impossible by a pacifist constitution, the nation had quietly emerged as a cultural powerhouse: "From pop music to consumer electronics, architecture to fashion, and food to art, Japan has far greater cultural influence now than it did in the 1980s, when it was an economic superpower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/519/feature.asp |title=Metropolis Tokyo Feature - Pop star |publisher=Metropolis.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2008-11-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610124048/http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/519/feature.asp |archivedate=2008-06-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of Asian 'cool' applied to Asian [[consumer electronics]] is borrowed from the cultural media theorist [[Eric McLuhan]] who described 'cool' or 'cold' media as stimulating participants to complete auditive or visual media content, in sharp contrast to 'hot' media that degrades the viewer to a merely passive or non-interactive receiver.

===Europe===

====Aristocratic and artistic cool====
[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Mona Lisa]], or La Gioconda (La Joconde), by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] expresses [[sprezzatura]], an "aristocratic cool".&lt;ref name=high&gt;[http://www.high.org/uploadedFiles/overview/newsroom/LouvreAtlantaReleaseFINAL(2).pdf The High Museum Campaign reaches $130 Million Goal]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930220032/http://www.high.org/uploadedFiles/overview/newsroom/LouvreAtlantaReleaseFINAL%282%29.pdf |date=September 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

"Aristocratic cool", known as [[sprezzatura]], has existed in Europe for centuries, particularly when relating to frank amorality and love or illicit pleasures behind closed doors;&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt; Raphael's "Portrait of [[Baldassare Castiglione]]" and Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" are classic examples of ''sprezzatura''.&lt;ref name=high/&gt; The ''sprezzatura'' of the Mona Lisa is seen in both her smile and the positioning of her hands. Both the smile and hands are intended to convey her grandeur, self-confidence and societal position.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/catdir/samples/har051/2001024956.html Sample text for Becoming Mona Lisa : the making of a global icon / Donald Sassoon.]&lt;/ref&gt; Sprezzatura means, literally, disdain and detachment. It is the art of refraining from the appearance of trying to present oneself in a particular way. In reality, of course, tremendous exertion went into pretending not to bother or care.

English poet and playwright [[William Shakespeare]] used cool in several of his works to describe composure and absence of emotion.&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt; In ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', written sometime in the late-16th century, he contrasts the shaping fantasies of lovers and madmen with "cool reason,"&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', Act V, Scene 1.&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Hamlet]]'' he wrote "O gentle son, upon the heat and flame of thy distemper, sprinkle cool patience,"&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''The Tragedy of Hamlet Prince of Denmark'', The Harvard Classics, 1909–14. Act III Scene IV&lt;/ref&gt; and the antagonist Iago in ''[[Othello]]'' is musing about "reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts."&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''Othello'', Act 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The cool "Anatolian smile" of [[Turkey]] is used to mask emotions. A similar "mask" of coolness is worn in both times of stress and pleasure in American and African communities.&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt;

====European inter-war cool====
The key themes of modern European cool were forged by avant-garde artists who achieved prominence in the aftermath of the First World War, most notably [[Dada]]ists, such as key Dada figures [[Arthur Cravan]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], and the left-wing milieu of the [[Weimar Republic]]. The program of such groups was often self-consciously revolutionary, a determination to scandalize the bourgeoisie by mocking their culture, sexuality and political moderation.&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt;

[[Berthold Brecht]], both a committed Communist and a philandering cynic, stands as the archetype of this inter-war cool. Brecht projected his cool attitude to life onto his most famous character Macheath or "Mackie Messer" (Mack the knife), in [[The Threepenny Opera]]. Mackie, the nonchalant, smooth-talking gangster, expert with the switchblade, personifies the bitter-sweet strain of cool; Puritanism and sentimentality are both anathema to the cool character.&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt;

During the turbulent inter-war years, cool was a privilege reserved for bohemian milieus like Brecht's. Cool irony and hedonism remained the province of cabaret artistes, ostentatious gangsters and rich socialites, those decadents depicted in [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s [[Brideshead Revisited]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]]'s [[Goodbye to Berlin]], tracing the outlines of a new cool. [[Peter Stearns]], professor of history at [[George Mason University]], suggests that in effect the seeds of a cool outlook had been sown among this inter-war generation.&lt;ref&gt;Peter N. Stearns, ''American Cool: Constructing a Twentieth-Century Emotional Style'' (History of Emotion), New York University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-World War II cool====
The Second World War brought the populations of Britain, Germany and France into intimate contact with Americans and American culture. The war brought hundreds of thousands of GIs whose relaxed, easy-going manner was seen by young people of the time as the very embodiment of liberation; and with them came Lucky Strikes, nylons, swing and jazz—the American Cool.

To be cool or hip meant hanging out, pursuing sexual liaisons, displaying the appropriate attitude of narcissistic self-absorption, and expressing a desire to escape the mental straitjacket of all ideological causes. From the late 1940s onward, this popular culture influenced young people all over the world, to the great dismay of the paternalistic elites who still ruled the official culture. The French intelligentsia were outraged, while the British educated classes displayed a haughty indifference that smacked of an older aristocratic cool.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Gold, Bohemia: Digging the Roots of Cool, Touchstone Books; Reprint edition 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Polish cool====
The new attitude found a special resonance behind the Iron Curtain, where it offered relief from the earnestness of socialist propaganda and socialist realism in art. In the Polish industrial city [[Łódź]], jazz, "the forbidden music", served Polish youth of the 1950s much as it had served its African-American creators, both as personal diversion and subterranean resistance to what they saw as a stultifying official culture. Some clubs featured live jazz performances, and their smoky, sexually charged atmosphere carried a message for which the puritanical values and monumental art of Marxist officialdom were an ideal foil.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Sloan, ''Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography'', Diane Pub. Co., 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving in Poland via France, America and England, Polish cool stimulated the film talents of a generation of artists, including [[Andrzej Wajda]], [[Roman Polanski]], and other graduates of the [[National Film School in Łódź]], as well as the novelist [[Jerzy Kosinski]], in whose clinical prose cool tends towards the sadistic.&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt;

====Czech cool====
In [[Prague]], the capital of Bohemia, cool flourished in the faded [[Art Deco]] splendor of the [[Cafe Slavia]]. Significantly, following the crushing of the [[Prague Spring]] by Soviet tanks in 1968, part of the dissident underground called itself the "Jazz Section".&lt;ref name=Pountain/&gt;

==Theories==
&lt;!--
===As an African-American aesthetic===
This is a very common viewpoint. 
{{Expand section|date=May 2012}}

===Robert Farris Thompson's ''African Art in Motion''===
{{Expand section|date=May 2012}}
--&gt;

===As a positive trait===
According to this theory, coolness is a subjective, dynamic, socially-constructed trait, such that coolness is in the eye of the beholder. People perceive things (e.g., other people, products or brands) to be cool based on an inference of “autonomy”. That is, something is perceived to be cool when it follows its own motivations. However, this theory proposes that the level of autonomy that leads to coolness is constrained - inappropriate levels of autonomy, such that the autonomy is too high or opposes a legitimate norm, do not lead to perceptions of coolness. The level of autonomy considered appropriate is influenced by individual difference variables. For example, people who think of societal institutions and authority as unjust or repressive perceive coolness at higher levels of autonomy than those who are less critical of social norms and authority.&lt;ref&gt;Warren &amp; Campbell, 'What Makes Things Cool? How Autonomy Influences Perceived Coolness.’ Article by Caleb Warren and Margaret C. Campbell; Journal of Consumer Research, Vol. 41, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===As social distinction===
According to this theory, ''coolness'' is a relative concept.  In other words, ''cool'' exists only in comparison with things considered less ''cool''; for example, in the book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', ''cool'' is created out of a need for status and distinction. This creates a situation analogous to an [[arms race]], in which ''cool'' is perpetuated by a [[collective action]] problem in society.&lt;ref name="rebel"&gt;Heath, Joseph and Potter, Andrew. ''[[The Rebel Sell]]''. Harper Perennial, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an elusive essence===
According to this theory, cool is a real, but unknowable property. ''Cool'', like "Good", is a property that exists, but can only be sought after. In the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article, "The Coolhunt",&lt;ref&gt;''[http://gladwell.com/the-coolhunt/ The Coolhunt]''&lt;/ref&gt; cool is given three characteristics:
* "The act of discovering what's cool is what causes cool to move on"
* "Cool cannot be manufactured, only observed"
* "[Cool] can only be observed by those who are themselves cool".

===As a marketing device===
{{rquote|right|[Cool is] a heavily manipulative corporate ethos.|[[Kalle Lasn]]}}
{{See also|Planned obsolescence|Cultural appropriation|CoolBrands (branding initiative)}}
{{rquote|right|Over the past decade, young black men in American inner cities have been the market most aggressively mined by brandmasters as a source of borrowed 'meaning' and identity...The truth is that the 'got to be cool' rhetoric of the global brands is, more often than not, an indirect way of saying 'got to be black.'|Designer [[Christian Lacroix]]&lt;ref name="Klein 2000 pg. 73-4"/&gt;}}

According to this theory, ''cool'' can be exploited as a manufactured and empty idea imposed on the culture at large through a top-down process by the "Merchants of Cool"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cool/etc/synopsis.html|title=Synopsis {{!}} Merchants Of Cool {{!}} FRONTLINE {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The "Merchants of Cool" are sellers of popular culture who capitalize off of trends and subcultures, most often created by youths. Some modern examples of the "Merchants of Cool" are record company executives, sneaker and fashion company branders and merchandisers. Furthermore, "cool has become the central ideology of [[consumer capitalism]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@wodenworks/what-s-in-a-word-telling-your-story-with-the-right-voice-e0d8caf80f50|title=What’s in a Word? Telling Your Story with the Right Voice|last=woden|date=2016-01-25|website=Medium|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the selling of cool thus drives young people and adults attempting to "fit in" to the mainstream and adhere to trends to purchase products and/or brands that make them appear cool.

The concept of cool was used in this way to market [[Menthol cigarette|menthol cigarettes]] to African Americans in the 1960s. In 2004 over 70% of African American smokers preferred menthol cigarettes, compared with 30% of white smokers. This unique social phenomenon was principally occasioned by the tobacco industry's manipulation of the burgeoning black, urban, segregated, consumer market in cities at that time. According to [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] some large companies have started '[[outsourcing]] cool.' They are paying other "smaller, more-limber, closer-to-the-ground outsider" companies to help them keep up with customers' rapidly changing tastes and demands. 

&lt;!--
===As an opinion===
Quite often, cool is in the eye of the beholder. One person, usually a member of a certain social demographic, could consider something to be ''cool'' whereas a member of a separate social demographic could consider completely the opposite to be worthy of the label. Trends are usually considered ''cool'' when only a small minority is involved in them. More people becoming interested in this trend pushes it towards the mainstream, therefore classifying it as ''uncool''. Something else will then emerge as a new trend, and the cycle will repeat indefinitely.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''Cowardice''' is a trait wherein [[fear]] and excessive self-concern override doing or saying what is right, good, and of help to others or oneself in a time of need—it is the opposite of [[courage]]. As a label, "cowardice"  indicates a failure of character in the face of a challenge. One who succumbs to cowardice is known as a coward.&lt;ref&gt; Dictionary.com [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cowardice cowardice]:  "[the] lack of courage to face danger, difficulty, opposition, pain, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[military law|military codes of justice]] proscribe cowardice in [[combat]] as a crime punishable by [[death]] (note the phrase "[[Execution by firing squad|shot at dawn]]").

As the opposite of an action or trait that many existing and formerly extant cultures [[Cultural norm|demand]], cowardice rates as a character flaw that many societies and their representatives stigmatize and/or punish.

==Etymology==
According to the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'', the word ''coward'' came into English from the [[Old French]] word ''coart'' (modern French [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/couard ''couard'']), which is a combination of the word for "tail" (Modern French ''queue'', [[Latin]] ''cauda'') and an [[agent (grammar)|agent]] [[noun]] [[suffix]]. It would therefore have meant "one with a tail", which may conjur an image of an animal displaying its tail in flight of fear ("turning tail"), or a [[dog]]'s habit of putting its tail between its legs when it is afraid. Like many other English words of French origin, this word was introduced in the English language by the French-speaking [[Normans]], after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.uml.edu/jgarreau/FromFrenchtoEnglish.htm From French to English:]. Faculty.uml.edu. Retrieved on 16 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English language|English]] [[surname]] Coward (as in [[Noël Coward]]), however, has the same origin and meaning as the word "cowherd".

==Military law==
Acts of cowardice have long been punishable by military law, which defines a wide range of cowardly offenses, including [[desertion]] in face of the enemy and surrendering to the enemy against orders. The punishment for such acts is typically severe, ranging from [[corporal punishment]] to the [[Capital punishment|death sentence]]. Cowardly conduct is specifically mentioned within the [[United States]] [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], in Article 99.

Generally, cowardice was punishable by execution during [[World War I]], and those who were caught were often court-martialed and, in many cases, [[executed by firing squad]]. British men executed for cowardice were often not commemorated on war memorials, and their families often did not receive benefits and had to endure social stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Executed WW1 soldiers to be given pardons|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/16/military.immigrationpolicy|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Call to rethink cases of French WWI 'coward' soldiers|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24356041|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many decades later, those soldiers all received posthumous pardons in the [[Armed Forces Act 2006#Pardon|Armed Forces Act 2006]] and have been commemorated with the [[Shot at Dawn Memorial]]. Unlike British, French, German, and Soviet/Russian forces, the United States forces tried soldiers for cowardice but never followed through with execution while German commanders were less inclined to use execution as a form of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=World War I Almanac|first=David R. |last=Woodward|page=28|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable controversy was generated by military historian [[S.L.A. Marshall]], who claimed that 75% of U.S. combat troops in World War II never fired at the enemy for the purpose of killing, even while under direct threat.  [[Dave Grossman (author)|Author Dave Grossman]] attempted to explain these findings in his book ''[[On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society ]]''. Marshall's findings were later challenged as mistaken or even fabricated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Robert Engen |url=http://www.journal.dnd.ca/vo9/no2/16-engen-eng.asp |title= Killing for Their Country: A New Look At "Killology" (Canadian Military Journal, Vol. 9, No. 2) |accessdate= 2011-05-08 |quote= As a military historian, I am instinctively skeptical of any work or theory that claims to overturn all existing scholarship – indeed, overturn an entire academic discipline – in one fell swoop...[however] Lieutenant Colonel Grossman’s appeals to biology and psychology are flawed, and that the bulwark of his historical evidence – S.L.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9825">'''Dau al Set''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈdaw əl ˈsɛt}}), the first post-[[World War II]] artistic movement in [[Catalonia]], was founded in [[Barcelona]] in September 1948 by poet [[Joan Brossa]].  The movement, best known for translating the conscious and unconscious mind into art, was heavily influenced by both the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[Dada]]ist movements. In [[Catalan language|Catalan]] Dau al Set means "the seventh face of the dice", which expresses the movement's rupturist character.

== History ==
Dau al Set first began as an [[avant-garde]] artistic collective led by [[Joan Brossa]], a Catalan poet, in  September 1948. [[Joan Brossa]] established the group in response to the period’s conservative reigning government, which gained power after the [[Spanish Civil War]] known as the "[[:es:Guerra Civil Española|Guerra Civil]]". Under the new [[Fascism|fascist]] regime, [[Francisco Franco]]  radically changed many areas of the previous culture. One such example was the Spanish art community as seen in [[art and culture in Francoist Spain]]. During this time counterculture movements in Catalonia and Spain in general came to an abrupt halt.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/revista-dau-al-set-modest-cuixart-2016|title=Revista Dau al Set. Modest Cuixart|website=www.macba.cat|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such artistic groups were replaced with [[Art and culture in Francoist Spain|Nationalist Fascist Art]], which often functioned as a means for government endorsement and propaganda. In an attempt to revive the avant-garde scene in Spain Dau al Set was formed.

In 1949, with help from [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]]'s private printing press, Dau al Set published its first self-entitled magazine journal. The majority of the publication was written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a language prohibited under the [[Francoist Spain|Franco Regime]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cirlot|first=Lourdes|date=December 2008|title=El grupo Dau al Set|url=http://www.triarte.es/catalogos/Cat%20Dau%20al%20Set.pdf|journal=El Mundo de Dau al Set|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dau al Set typically ran a print between one hundred and two hundred copies,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; consisting of four to twelve pages.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franco Lahoz|first=Amado|date=December 2008|title=Sumario de la revista Dau al Set|url=http://www.triarte.es/catalogos/Cat%20Dau%20al%20Set.pdf|journal=El Mundo de Dau al Set|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine journal was delivered throughout Barcelona to those with subscriptions and served a niche population at the time. The format of the magazine was 22.5&amp;nbsp;cm x 18.7&amp;nbsp;cm in the [[broadsheet]] style and never bound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These publications continued on a regular basis until the end of 1951 at which point Dau al Set began to dissolve.

In 1952, Dau al Set founding member [[Antoni Tàpies]] left the group to promote his own independent work in the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[Informalism|Informal]] art styles. The following year [[Joan Ponç]] left to Brazil to continue to paint and spread his unique style. And one year later [[Modest Cuixart|Modest Cuixcart]] left the group as well. During this time from 1953 till 1956 Dau al Set continued to be created and published by Joan-Josep Tharrats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the final years the magazine decreased from an issue a month to an issue every season to then two issues a year. The final issue was created and distributed in 1956.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Style ==
Initially, Dau al Set began as an offshoot of [[Surrealism]], but slowly grew into a distinct style with many existing components. One such component began with the incorporation of the surrealist world of dreams, where in Dau al Set expands upon by combing scientific and philosophical articles with magical undertones derived from [[Joan Brossa|Joan Brossa's]] personalized style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lletra.uoc.edu/ca/revista/dau-al-set-1948-1956/detall|title=Dau al Set (1948-1956) - lletrA - Literatura catalana a internet|last=Catalunya|first=Universitat Oberta de|website=lletra.uoc.edu|language=ca|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of magical elements pervaded throughout the entire movement to showcase an esoteric world of inner exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elcultural.com/revista/arte/Dau-al-set/14686|title=Dau al set|website=www.elcultural.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While magic was seen consistently the different members each contributed a unique style to Dau al Set. One of the most drastic was the contributions from [[Joan Ponç]]. Ponç's art frequently contained demonic images actualized with a series of different monsters throughout the work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast, [[Modest Cuixart|Modest Cuixart's]] work often contained images of fantasy influenced by [[German Expressionism|German expressionism]] and [[Joan Miró]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, [[Antoni Tàpies|Antoni Tápies]] often emulated the style of [[Paul Klee]] with obscure images surrounded by a dark atmosphere and phosphorescent lighting. With the base of magical elements these three unique techniques joined together to create the style seen in the Dau al Set movement.

== Influences ==
Dau al Set  was heavily influenced by two movements before its creation, those two being [[Dada]]ism and [[Surrealism]].  Dadaism was a European art movement in the early 20th century which focused on the avant-garde. This style was meant to fight against the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] in society with the belief that their reason and logic were the cause of war. With an anti-reason and anti-logic sentiment most of the works of art often contained elements of chaos and irrationality. Dadaist art also utilized the following techniques of [[cubism]], [[collage]]s, [[cut-up technique]], [[photomontage]]s, and [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] which can be seen in Dau al Set's work. From this movement spawned the pre-war avant-garde which was the community Dau al Set were trying to revive. Some influential artists on Dau al Set from this movement are [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Max Ernst]].

Another influence on Dau al Set was [[Surrealism]], a cultural movement greatly influenced by Dadaism, which began in the 1920s. This style was often considered a portrayal of the dream world; a reality which existed right below everyday life. It also had a large political focus which was often used to contradict a given community's social norms often imposed by the bourgeois. Some artists from this movement that influenced Dau al Set were [[Joan Miró]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Josep Vicenç Foix]], and [[Salvador Dalí]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other methods that were influenced was the idea of magical aspects that were often seen in the dream world surrealism created. However, in Dau al Set these magical aspects were developed and expounded upon.

== Members ==
There were six founding members of Dau al Set including a poet [[Joan Brossa]], a philosopher [[Arnau Puig]], three artists [[Joan Ponç]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], and [[Modest Cuixart]], as well as a dual painter and editor [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]].

Over the years Dau al Set ran there were occasional contributors, such as [[Juan Eduardo Cirlot]], [[Antonio Saura]], [[Enrique Tábara]], and [[Manolo Millares]]. Their contributions came often in the form of writings which helped to continued to establish Dau al Set as an intellectual piece of work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Impact ==
Dau al Set has had a lasting impact throughout history the most notable being the continuation of the avant-garde in Spain throughout a repressive regime. Moreover, Dau al Set contributed to the creation of the [[Informalism|Informalist]] movement seen in Spain during the fifties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arteespana.com/grupodaualset.htm|title=Grupo Dau al Set|website=www.arteespana.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the magical and fantasy elements of Dau al Set was seen to later emerge again in Spain in the eighties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This group also stood as a large influence for other artistic movements in Spain such as the [[Grup d'Elx|Grup d’Elx]] and El Paso, with important artists such as [[Joan Castejón]], [[Eusebio Sempere]] or [[Manolo Millares]]. Additionally, each of the members made their own impacts after the movement was dissolved. Most notably is [[Antoni Tàpies]] who continued with his style based heavily in surrealism and later became a notable artist for his work in Abstract art.

[[File:Islm.svg|thumb|A diagram of the [[IS/LM model]]]]

In [[economics]], a '''model''' is a [[theory|theoretical]] construct representing economic [[wikt:process|processes]] by a set of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] and a set of [[logic]]al and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic [[Conceptual model|model]] is a simplified, often [[Mathematical model|mathematical]], framework designed to illustrate complex processes. Frequently, economic models posit [[Coefficient of regression|structural parameters]].&lt;ref&gt;Moffatt, Mike. (2008) [[About.com]] ''[http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/structuralp.htm Structural Parameters]'' Economics Glossary; Terms Beginning with S. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A model may have various [[exogenous variable]]s, and those variables may change to create various responses by economic variables. Methodological uses of models include investigation, theorizing, and fitting theories to the world.&lt;ref&gt; [[Mary S. Morgan]], 2008 "models," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_M000391 Abstract].&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  Vivian Walsh 1987. "models and theory," ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, pp. 482–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

In general terms, economic models have two functions: first as a simplification of and abstraction from observed data, and second as a means of selection of data based on a [[paradigm]] of [[econometric]] study.

''Simplification'' is particularly important for economics given the enormous [[complexity]] of economic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=M. |authorlink=Milton Friedman |chapter=The Methodology of Positive Economics |title=Essays in Positive Economics |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This complexity can be attributed to the diversity of factors that determine economic activity; these factors include: individual  and [[co-operation|cooperative]] decision processes, [[Natural resource|resource]] limitations, [[natural environment|environment]]al and [[geography|geographical]] constraints, [[institution]]al and [[law|legal]] requirements and purely [[random]] fluctuations.  Economists therefore must make a reasoned choice of which variables and which relationships between these variables are relevant and which ways of analyzing and presenting this information are useful.

''Selection'' is important because the nature of an economic model will often determine what facts will be looked at, and how they will be compiled. For example, [[inflation]] is a general economic concept, but to measure inflation requires a model of behavior, so that an economist can differentiate between changes in relative prices and changes in price that are to be attributed to inflation.

In addition to their professional [[academia|academic]] interest, the use of models include:
* [[Forecasting]] economic activity in a  way in which conclusions are logically related to assumptions;
* Proposing [[economic policy]] to modify future economic activity;
* Presenting reasoned arguments to politically justify economic policy at the national level, to explain and influence [[corporation|company]] strategy at the level of the firm,  or to provide intelligent advice for household economic decisions at the level of households.
* [[Plan]]ning and [[allocation of resources|allocation]], in the case of centrally [[planned economy|planned]] economies, and on a smaller scale in [[logistics]] and [[management]] of [[business]]es.
* In [[finance]] predictive models have been used since the 1980s for [[Trade|trading]] ([[investment]], and [[speculation]]), for example emerging market [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] were often traded based on economic models predicting the growth of the [[developing nation]] issuing them. Since the 1990s many long-term [[risk management]] models have incorporated economic relationships between simulated variables in an attempt to detect high-exposure future scenarios (often through a [[Monte Carlo method]]).

A model establishes an ''[[logical argument|argumentative framework]]'' for applying logic and [[mathematics]] that can be independently discussed and tested and that can be applied in various instances. Policies and arguments that rely on economic models have a clear basis for soundness, namely the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the supporting model.

Economic models in current use do not pretend to be ''theories of everything economic''; any such pretensions would immediately be thwarted by [[computation]]al infeasibility and the incompleteness or lack of theories for various types of economic behavior.  Therefore, conclusions drawn from models will be approximate representations of economic facts.  However, properly constructed models can remove extraneous information and isolate useful [[approximation]]s of key relationships.  In this way more can be understood about the relationships in question than by trying to understand the entire economic process.

The details of model construction vary with type of model and its application, but a generic process can be identified. Generally any modelling process has two steps: generating a model, then checking the model for accuracy (sometimes called diagnostics). The diagnostic step is important because a model is only useful to the extent that it accurately mirrors the relationships that it purports to describe. Creating and diagnosing a model is frequently an iterative process in which the model is modified (and hopefully improved) with each iteration of diagnosis and respecification. Once a satisfactory model is found, it should be double checked by applying it to a different data set.

== Types of models ==

According to whether all the model variables are deterministic, economic models can be classified as [[stochastic process|stochastic]] or non-stochastic models; according to whether all the variables are quantitative, economic models are classified as discrete or continuous choice model; according to the model's intended purpose/function, it can be classified as
quantitative or qualitative; according to the model's ambit, it can be classified as a general equilibrium model, a partial equilibrium model, or even a non-equilibrium model; according to the economic agent's characteristics, models can be classified as rational agent models, representative agent models etc.

*'''Stochastic models''' are formulated using [[stochastic process]]es. They model economically observable values over time. Most of [[econometrics]] is based on [[statistics]] to formulate and test [[hypotheses]] about these processes or estimate parameters for them. A widely used bargaining class of simple econometric models popularized by [[Jan Tinbergen|Tinbergen]] and later [[Herman Wold|Wold]] are [[autoregressive]] models, in which the stochastic process satisfies some relation between current and past values. Examples of these are [[autoregressive moving average model]]s and related ones such as [[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]] (ARCH) and [[GARCH]] models for the modelling of [[heteroskedasticity]].
*'''Non-stochastic models''' may be purely qualitative (for example, relating to [[social choice theory]]) or quantitative (involving rationalization of financial variables, for example with [[hyperbolic coordinates]], and/or specific forms of [[Function (mathematics)|functional relationships]] between variables).  In some cases economic predictions in a coincidence of a model merely assert the direction of movement of economic variables, and so the functional relationships are used only stoical in a qualitative sense: for example, if the [[price]] of an item increases, then the [[Demand (economics)|demand]] for that item will decrease.  For such models, economists often use two-dimensional graphs instead of functions.
*'''Qualitative models''' – although almost all economic models involve some form of mathematical or quantitative analysis, qualitative models are occasionally used. One example is qualitative [[scenario planning]] in which possible future events are played out. Another example is non-numerical decision tree analysis. Qualitative models often suffer from lack of precision.

At a more practical level, quantitative modelling is applied to many areas of economics and several methodologies have evolved more or less independently of each other. As a result, no overall model [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] is naturally available.  We can nonetheless provide a few examples that illustrate some particularly relevant points of model construction.
*An [[accounting]] model is one based on the premise that for every [[credit (finance)|credit]] there is a [[debit]]. More symbolically, an accounting model expresses some principle of conservation in the form
:: algebraic sum of inflows = sinks − sources

:This principle is certainly true for [[money]] and it is the basis for [[national income]] accounting.  Accounting models are true by [[Convention (norm)|convention]], that is any [[experiment]]al failure to confirm them,  would be attributed to [[fraud]], arithmetic error or an extraneous  injection (or destruction) of cash, which we would interpret as showing the experiment was conducted improperly.

*Optimality and constrained optimization models – Other examples of quantitative models are based on principles such as [[Profit (economics)|profit]] or [[utility]] [[utility maximization|maximization]].  An example of such a model is given by the [[comparative statics]] of [[tax]]ation on the profit-maximizing firm. The profit of a firm is given by

::&lt;math&gt; \pi(x,t) = x p(x) - C(x) - t x \quad&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the price that a product commands in the market if it is supplied at the rate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;xp(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the revenue obtained from selling the product, &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the cost of bringing the product to [[Market (economics)|market]] at the rate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the tax that the firm must pay per unit of the product sold.

:The [[profit maximization]] assumption states that a firm will produce at the output rate ''x'' if that rate maximizes the firm's profit. Using [[differential calculus]] we can obtain conditions on ''x'' under which this holds. The first order maximization condition for ''x'' is

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial  \pi(x,t)}{\partial x} =\frac{\partial  (x p(x) - C(x))}{\partial x} -t= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:Regarding ''x'' as an implicitly defined function of ''t'' by this equation (see  [[implicit function theorem]]), one concludes that the [[derivative]] of ''x'' with respect to ''t'' has the same sign as

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2  (x p(x) - C(x))}{\partial^2 x}={\partial^2\pi(x,t)\over \partial x^2},&lt;/math&gt;

:which is negative if the [[Second derivative test|second order condition]]s for a [[local maximum]] are satisfied.

:Thus the profit maximization model predicts something about the effect of taxation on output, namely that output decreases with increased taxation. If the predictions of the model fail, we conclude that the profit maximization hypothesis was false; this should lead to alternate theories of the firm, for example based on [[bounded rationality]].

:Borrowing a notion apparently first used in economics by [[Paul Samuelson]], this model of taxation and the predicted dependency of output on the tax rate, illustrates an ''operationally meaningful theorem''; that is one requiring some economically meaningful assumption that is [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] under certain conditions.

* Aggregate models. [[Macroeconomics]] needs to deal with aggregate quantities such as [[Output (economics)|output]], the [[price level]], the [[interest rate]] and so on. Now real output is actually a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] of [[good (accounting)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|service]]s, such as cars, passenger airplanes, [[computer]]s, food items, secretarial services, home repair services etc. Similarly [[price]] is the vector of individual prices of goods and services. Models in which the vector nature of the quantities is maintained are used in practice, for example [[Wassily Leontief|Leontief]] [[input-output model]]s are of this kind.  However, for the most part, these models are computationally much harder to deal with and harder to use as tools for [[qualitative research|qualitative analysis]]. For this reason, [[macroeconomic model]]s usually lump together different variables into a single quantity such as ''output'' or ''price''. Moreover, quantitative relationships between these aggregate variables are often parts of important macroeconomic theories.  This process of aggregation and functional dependency between various aggregates usually is interpreted statistically and validated by [[econometrics]]. For instance, one ingredient of the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian model]] is a functional relationship between consumption and national income: C = C(''Y'').  This relationship plays an important role in Keynesian analysis.

== Problems with economic models ==

Most economic models rest on a number of assumptions that are not entirely realistic.  For example, agents are often assumed to have perfect information, and markets are often assumed to clear without friction.  Or, the model may omit issues that are important to the question being considered, such as [[Externality|externalities]]. Any analysis of the results of an economic model must therefore consider the extent to which these results may be compromised by inaccuracies in these assumptions, and a large literature has grown up discussing [[problems with economic models]], or at least asserting that their results are unreliable.

== History ==

One of the major problems addressed by economic models has been understanding economic growth.  An early attempt to provide a technique to approach this came from the French [[physiocrat]]ic school in the Eighteenth century.  Among these economists, [[François Quesnay]] should be noted, particularly for his development and use of tables he called ''[[Tableau économique|Tableaux économiques]]''.  These tables have in fact been interpreted in more modern terminology as a Leontiev model, see the Phillips reference below.

All through the 18th century (that is, well before the founding of modern political economy, conventionally marked by Adam Smith's 1776 [[Wealth of Nations]]) simple probabilistic models were used to understand the economics of [[insurance]]. This was a natural extrapolation of the theory of [[gambling]], and played an important role both in the development of [[probability theory]] itself and in the development of [[actuarial science]]. Many of the giants of 18th century [[mathematics]] contributed to this field. Around 1730, [[De Moivre]] addressed some of these problems in the 3rd edition of ''[[The Doctrine of Chances]]''. Even earlier (1709), [[Nicolas Bernoulli]] studies problems related to savings and interest in the [[Ars Conjectandi]]. In 1730, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] studied "moral probability" in his book [[Mensura Sortis]], where he introduced what would today be called "logarithmic utility of money" and applied it to gambling and insurance problems, including a solution of the paradoxical [[St. Petersburg paradox|Saint Petersburg problem]]. All of these developments were summarized by [[Laplace]] in his [[Analytical Theory of Probabilities]] (1812). Clearly, by the time [[David Ricardo]] came along he had a lot of well-established math to draw from.

== Tests of macroeconomic predictions ==
In the late 1980s the [[Brookings Institution]] compared 12 leading [[macroeconomic models]] available at the time. They compared the models' predictions for how the economy would respond to specific economic shocks (allowing the models to control for all the variability in the real world; this was a test of model vs. model, not a test against the actual outcome). Although the models simplified the world and started from a stable, known common parameters the various models gave significantly different answers. For instance, in calculating the impact of a [[monetary]] loosening on output some models estimated a 3% change in [[GDP]] after one year, and one gave almost no change, with the rest spread between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankel|first=Jeffrey A.|title=The Sources of Disagreement Among International Macro Models and Implications for Policy Coordination|work=NBER Working Paper No. 1925 |date=May 1986 |doi=10.3386/w1925 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly as a result of such experiments, modern central bankers no longer have as much confidence that it is possible to 'fine-tune' the economy as they had in the 1960s and early 1970s. Modern policy makers tend to use a less activist approach, explicitly because they lack confidence that their models will actually predict where the economy is going, or the effect of any shock upon it. The new, more humble, approach sees danger in dramatic policy changes based on model predictions, because of several practical and theoretical limitations in current macroeconomic models; in addition to the theoretical pitfalls, ([[Model (economics)#Pitfalls|listed above]]) some problems specific to aggregate modelling are:
* Limitations in model construction caused by difficulties in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the real economy. (Hence the profusion of separate models.)
* The law of [[unintended consequence]]s, on elements of the real economy not yet included in the model.
* The [[Lag operator|time lag]] in both receiving data and the reaction of economic variables to policy makers attempts to 'steer' them (mostly through [[monetary]] policy) in the direction that central bankers want them to move. [[Milton Friedman]] has vigorously argued that these lags are so long and unpredictably variable that effective management of the macroeconomy is impossible.
* The difficulty in correctly specifying all of the parameters (through [[econometric]] measurements) even if the structural model and data were perfect.
* The fact that all the model's relationships and coefficients are stochastic, so that the error term becomes very large quickly, and the available snapshot of the input parameters is already out of date.
* Modern economic models incorporate the reaction of the public and market to the policy maker's actions (through [[game theory]]), and this feedback is included in modern models (following the [[rational expectations]] revolution and [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]]'s [[Lucas critique]] of non-[[microfounded]]) models. If the response to the decision maker's actions (and their [[time inconsistency|credibility]]) must be included in the model then it becomes much harder to influence some of the variables simulated.

=== Comparison with models in other sciences ===

[[Complex systems]] specialist and mathematician [[David Orrell]] wrote on this issue in his book [[Apollo's Arrow]] and explained that the weather, human health and economics use similar methods of prediction (mathematical models). Their systems—the atmosphere, the human body and the economy—also have similar levels of complexity. He found that forecasts fail because the models suffer from two problems : (i) they cannot capture the full detail of the underlying system, so rely on approximate equations; (ii) they are sensitive to small changes in the exact form of these equations. This is because complex systems like the economy or the climate consist of a delicate balance of opposing forces, so a slight imbalance in their representation has big effects. Thus, predictions of things like economic recessions are still highly inaccurate, despite the use of enormous models running on fast computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postpythagorean.com/FAQ.html|title=FAQ for Apollo's Arrow Future of Everything|author=|date=|website=www.postpythagorean.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of deterministic chaos on economic models ===

Economic and meteorological simulations may share a fundamental limit to their predictive powers: [[Chaos theory|chaos]]. Although the modern mathematical work on [[chaotic systems]] began in the 1970s the danger of chaos had been identified and defined in ''[[Econometrica]]'' as early as 1958:
:"Good theorising consists to a large extent in avoiding assumptions....(with the property that)....a small change in what is posited will seriously affect the conclusions."
:([[William Baumol]], Econometrica, 26 ''see'': [http://www.iemss.org/iemss2004/pdf/keynotes/Keynote_OXLEY.pdf ''Economics on the Edge of Chaos'']).

It is straightforward to design economic models susceptible to [[butterfly effect]]s of initial-condition sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Wilmott]] on his early research in finance: "I quickly dropped... chaos theory (as) it was too easy to construct ‘toy models’ that looked plausible but were useless in practice." {{citation|first=Paul|last=Wilmott|title=Frequently Asked Questions in Quantitative Finance| publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4swgjSoMyIC&amp;pg=PT227 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~ages/files/NL_Chaos_and_%20Macro%20-%20429%20Essay.pdf|format=PDF|first=Steve|last=Kuchta|title=Nonlinearity and Chaos in Macroeconomics and Financial Markets|publisher=[[University of Connecticut]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[econometric]] research program to identify which variables are chaotic (if any) has largely concluded that aggregate macroeconomic variables probably do not behave chaotically. This would mean that refinements to the models could ultimately produce reliable long-term forecasts. However the validity of this conclusion has generated two challenges:
* In 2004 [[Philip Mirowski]] challenged this view and those who hold it, saying that chaos in economics is suffering from a biased "crusade" against it by [[neo-classical economics]] in order to preserve their mathematical models.
* The variables in [[finance]] may well be subject to chaos. Also in 2004, the [[University of Canterbury]] study ''Economics on the Edge of Chaos'' concludes that after noise is removed from [[S&amp;P 500]] returns, evidence of [[determinism|deterministic]] chaos ''is'' found.

More recently, chaos (or the butterfly effect) has been identified as less significant than previously thought to explain prediction errors. Rather, the predictive power of economics and meteorology would mostly be limited by the models themselves and the nature of their underlying systems (see [[Economic models#Comparison with models in other sciences|Comparison with models in other sciences]] above).

=== Critique of hubris in planning ===

A key strand of [[free market]] economic thinking is that the market's [[invisible hand]] guides an economy to prosperity more efficiently than [[command economy|central planning]] using an economic model. One reason, emphasized by [[Friedrich Hayek]], is the claim that many of the true forces shaping the economy can never be captured in a single plan. This is an argument that cannot be made through a conventional (mathematical) economic model, because it says that there are critical systemic-elements that will always be omitted from any top-down analysis of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1945">'''Effect algebras''' are [[algebraic structure]]s of a kind introduced by D.&amp;nbsp;Foulis and M.&amp;nbsp;Bennett&lt;ref&gt;D. Foulis and M. Bennett. "Effect algebras and unsharp quantum logics", ''Found. Phys.'', 24(10):1331–1352, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; to serve as a framework for unsharp measurements in [[quantum mechanics]].

An effect algebra consists of an underlying set ''A'' equipped with a partial binary operation ⊞, a unary operation (−)&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;, and two special elements 0, 1 such that the following relationships hold:&lt;ref&gt;Frank Roumen, "Cohomology of effect algebras" https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.00567v1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* The binary operation is commutative: if ''a'' ⊞ ''b'' is defined, then so is ''b'' ⊞ ''a'', and they are equal.
* The binary operation is associative: if ''a'' ⊞ ''b'' and (''a'' ⊞ ''b'') ⊞ ''c'' are defined, then so are ''b'' ⊞ ''c'' and ''a'' ⊞ (''b'' ⊞ ''c''), and (''a'' ⊞ ''b'') ⊞ ''c'' = ''a'' ⊞ (''b'' ⊞ ''c'').
* The zero element behaves as expected: 0 ⊞ ''a'' is always defined and equals ''a''.
* The unary operation is an orthocomplementation: for each ''a'' ∈ ''A'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; is the unique element of ''A'' for which ''a'' ⊞ ''a''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.
* A zero-one law holds: if ''a'' ⊞ 1 is defined, then ''a'' = 0.

Every effect algebra carries a natural [[partial order|order]]:  define ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if there exists an element ''c'' such that {{nowrap|''a'' ⊞ ''c''}} exists and is equal to&amp;nbsp;''b''. The defining axioms of effect algebras guarantee that&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;is a partial order.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv = 1602.00567| title = Cohomology of effect algebras | date = 2016-02-02 | last = Roumen | first = Frank | doi=10.4204/EPTCS.236.12 | volume=236 | journal=Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science | pages=174–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entertainment''' is a form of activity that holds the attention and [[Interest (emotion)|interest]] of an [[audience]], or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (Oxford University Press, 1971, Vol 1 pp.&amp;nbsp;213–14) gives Latin and French origins for the word, including ''inter'' (among) + ''tenir'' (to hold) as derivations, giving translations of "to hold mutually" or "to hold intertwined" and "to engage, keep occupied, the [[attention]] thoughts or time (of a person)". It also provides words like "merry-making", "pleasure", "delight", as well as "to receive as a guest and show hospitality to". It cites a 1490 usage by [[William Caxton]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. [[Storytelling]], [[music]], [[drama]], [[dance]], and different kinds of [[performance]] exist in all cultures, were supported in [[Court (royal)|royal courts]], developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an [[entertainment industry]] that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a [[banquet]] adapted for two; to any size or type of [[party]], with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.

The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with [[amusement]], so that one common understanding of the idea is [[fun]] and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of [[ceremony]], celebration, [[religious festival]], or [[satire]] for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving [[insight]] or intellectual growth.

An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private [[recreation]] or [[leisure]] activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[opera]], [[television show]], or [[film]]; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of [[game]]s, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of [[theatre]] or [[concert]]s; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of [[List of traditional children's games|children's games]]. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]]. Films and [[video game]]s, for example, although they use newer media, continue to [[storytelling|tell stories]], present drama, and play music. [[Festival]]s devoted to [[music festival|music]], [[Film festival|film]], or [[Competitive dance|dance]] allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.

Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as [[fencing]] or [[archery]], once necessary skills for some, have become serious [[sport]]s and even [[professional|professions]] for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as [[cooking]], have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.

The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative [[remix]]. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.

== Psychology and philosophy ==
Entertainment can be distinguished from other activities such as [[education]] and [[marketing]] even though they have learned how to use the appeal of entertainment to achieve their different goals. The importance and impact of entertainment is recognised by scholars&lt;ref&gt;For example, the application of psychological models and theories to entertainment is discussed in Part III of {{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Jennings|title=Psychology of Entertainment|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-5238-7|pages=367–434|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFSayreKing2010|last=Sayre|first=Shay|title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations (Google eBook)|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-415-99806-9|edition=2nd|author2=King, Cynthia}} p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and its increasing sophistication has influenced practices in other fields such as [[museology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation, Education, Entertainment?|year=2011|publisher=Channel View Publication|isbn=978-1-84541-164-0|editor=Frost, Warwick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Revolutions|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-203-93264-1|authors=Macleod, Suzanne; Watson, Sheila|editor=Knell, Simon J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists say the function of media entertainment is "the attainment of [[gratification]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zillmann|first=Dolf|title=Media Entertainment –  the psychology of its appeal|year=2000|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. Taylor &amp; Francis e-library (2009)|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-3324-2|page=vii|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; No other results or measurable benefit are usually expected from it (except perhaps the final score in a sporting entertainment). This is in contrast to education (which is designed with the purpose of developing understanding or helping people to learn) and marketing (which aims to encourage people to purchase commercial products). However, the distinctions become blurred when education seeks to be more "entertaining" and entertainment or marketing seek to be more "educational". Such mixtures are often known by the [[neologism]]s "[[edutainment]]" or "[[infotainment]]". The psychology of entertainment as well as of learning has been applied to all these fields.&lt;ref&gt;For example, marketers mix commercial messages with non-commercial messages in entertainments on radio, television, films, videos and games. {{cite book|last=Shrum|first=L.J.J.|title=The Psychology of Entertainment Media|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-84872-944-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some education-entertainment is a serious attempt to combine the best features of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Entertainment-Education and Social Change: History, Research, and Practice|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=1-4106-0959-6|editors=Singhal, Arvind; Cody, Michael J.; Rogers, Everett; Sabido, Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Games and Learning |year=2011 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=London; New York |isbn=978-1-4411-9870-9 |editor1-last=de Freitas |editor1-first=Sara |editor2-last=Maharg |editor2-first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people are entertained by others' pain or the idea of their unhappiness ([[schadenfreude]]).

An entertainment might go beyond gratification and produce some insight in its audience.  Entertainment may skillfully consider universal philosophical questions such as: "What is the meaning of life?"; "What does it mean to be human?"; "What is the right thing to do?"; or "How do I know what I know?". Questions such as these drive many narratives and dramas, whether they are presented in the form of a story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or game. Dramatic examples include [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s influential play ''[[Hamlet]]'', whose hero articulates these concerns in [[poetry]]; and films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', which explores the nature of knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Irwin|editor-first=William|title=The Matrix and Philosophy|year=2002|publisher=Carus Publishing Company|location=Peru, Illinois|page=196|isbn=0-8126-9502-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released world-wide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ql_9 IMDb ''The Matrix'' worldwide release dates]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novel]]s give great scope for investigating these themes while they entertain their readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Peter|title=Philosophy and the Novel|year=1975|location=Oxford, Clarendon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a creative work that considers philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very wide range of forms is ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. Originally a [[radio comedy]], this story became so popular that it has also appeared as a novel, film, television series, stage show, comic, [[audiobook]], [[LP record]], [[adventure game]] and [[online game]], its ideas became popular references (see [[Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]) and has been translated into many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson, M.J. |title=The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide |edition=2nd |publisher=Pocket Essentials |year=2005 |isbn=1-904048-46-3 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its themes encompass the [[meaning of life]], as well as "the [[ethics]] of entertainment, [[artificial intelligence]], multiple worlds, God, and [[philosophical method]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Joll|editor-first=Nicholas|title=Philosophy and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire; New York|isbn=978-0-230-29112-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ancient craft of communicating events and experiences, using words, images, sounds and gestures" by telling a story&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gakhar|first=Sonia|title=The influence of storytelling on pre-service students' attitudes and intentions (MSc Thesis)|year=2007|publisher=Iowa State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not only the means by which people passed on their cultural values and traditions and history from one generation to another, it has been an important part of most forms of entertainment ever since the earliest times. Stories are still told in the early forms, for example, around a fire while [[camping]], or when listening to the stories of another culture as a [[tourist]]. "The earliest storytelling sequences we possess, now of course, committed to writing, were undoubtedly originally a speaking from mouth to ear and their force as entertainment derived from the very same elements we today enjoy in films and novels."&lt;ref name=Kuhns&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhns|first=Richard Francis|title=Decameron and the Philosophy of Storytelling: Author as Midwife and Pimp|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York; Chichester West Sussex|isbn=0-231-13608-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storytelling is an activity that has evolved and developed "toward variety".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Many entertainments, including storytelling but especially music and drama, remain familiar but have developed into a wide variety of form to suit a very wide range of personal preferences and cultural expression. Many types are blended or supported by other forms. For example, drama, stories and banqueting (or dining) are commonly enhanced by music; sport and [[game]]s are incorporated into other activities to increase appeal. Some may have evolved from serious or necessary activities (such as [[running]] and [[jumping]]) into competition and then become entertainment. It is said, for example, that [[pole vault]]ing "may have originated in the Netherlands, where people used long poles to vault over wide canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to the nearest bridge. Others maintain that pole vaulting was used in warfare to vault over fortress walls during battle."&lt;ref name=Carlsen&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlsen|first=Spike|title=A Splintered History of Wood|year=2009|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-137356-5|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment for such sports has become increasingly sophisticated. Vaulting poles, for example, were originally made from woods such as [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[hickory]] or [[hazel]];  in the 19th century [[bamboo]] was used and in the 21st century poles can be made of [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre]].&lt;ref name=Carlsen/&gt; Other activities, such as [[Stilts|walking on stilts]], are still seen in [[circus]] performances in the 21st century. [[Gladiator|Gladiatorial combats]], also known as "gladiatorial games", popular during Roman times, provide a good example of an activity that is a combination of sport, punishment, and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Gladiators: violence and spectacle in ancient Rome|author = Dunkle, Roger| year= 2008| location = Harlow, England; New York| publisher = Pearson/Longman| isbn = 9781405807395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Medieval Sport: Quest for Survival | author1=Wiseman, Douglas C. | year=1977  | publisher=Distributed by ERIC Clearinghouse Microfiche }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to what is regarded as entertainment can occur in response to cultural or historical shifts. Hunting wild animals, for example, was introduced into the [[Roman Empire]] from [[Carthage]] and became a popular public entertainment and spectacle, supporting an international trade in wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potter|first=David Stone|title=Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire|year=1999|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-10924-3|page=308|author2=Mattingly, David J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entertainment also evolved into different forms and expressions as a result of social upheavals such as wars and revolutions. During the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]], for example, [[Revolutionary opera]] was sanctioned by the Communist party and [[World War I]], the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Russian revolution]] all affected entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roshwald|first=Aviel|title=European Culture in the Great War: The Arts, Entertainment and Propaganda, 1914–1918|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-57015-8|author2=Stites, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heinrich|first=Anselm|title=Heinrich, Entertainment, propaganda, education: regional theatre in Germany and Britain between 1918 and 1945|year=2007|publisher=University of Hertfordshire Press|location=Hatfield, England|isbn=978-1-902806-74-7|editor=Meech, Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur|first=Max|title=When this bloody war is over: soldiers' songs from the First World War|year=2001|publisher=Piatkus|location=London|isbn=0-7499-2252-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Horn, Dave Laing, Paul Oliver, Peter Wicke, Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society,"&gt;{{cite book|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society|year=2003|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-6321-5|authors=Laing, Dave; Oliver, Paul; Wicke, Peter|editor=Horn, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McReynolds|first=Louise|title=Russia at Play: Leisure Activities at the End of the Tsarist Era|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University|isbn=0-8014-4027-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively minor changes to the form and venue of an entertainment continue to come and go as they are affected by the period, fashion, culture, technology, and economics. For example, a story told in dramatic form can be presented in an open-air theatre, a [[music hall]], a [[Movie theater|movie theatre]], a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]], or as technological possibilities advanced, via a personal electronic device such as a [[tablet computer]]. Entertainment is provided for mass audiences in purpose-built structures such as a [[Theater (structure)|theatre]], [[auditorium]], or [[stadium]]. One of the most famous venues in the Western world, the [[Colosseum]], "dedicated [[Before common era|AD]]&amp;nbsp;80 with a hundred days of games, held fifty thousand spectators," and in it audiences "enjoyed "blood sport with the trappings of stage shows".{{sfnp|ref=harv|McDonald Walton|2007|p=51}} [[Spectacle]]s, competitions, [[Racing|races]], and sports were once presented in this purpose-built arena as public entertainment. New stadia continue to be built to suit the ever more sophisticated requirements of global audiences.

=== Court entertainment ===

[[File:Ralph Hedley The tournament 1898.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ralph Hedley]] ''The Tournament'' (1898) Children adapting a courtly entertainment]]
Imperial and royal courts have provided training grounds and support for professional entertainers, with different cultures using palaces, castles and forts in different ways. In the [[Maya civilization|Maya city states]], for example, "spectacles often took place in large plazas in front of palaces; the crowds gathered either there or in designated places from which they could watch at a distance."&lt;ref name=Walthall&gt;{{cite book|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-520-25443-5|editor=Walthall, Anne|ref=CITEREFWalthall2008}} pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Court entertainments also crossed cultures. For example, the [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] was introduced to India by the [[Mughal emperors|Mughals]], and passed onto the [[British Empire]], which then followed Indian tradition: "institutions, titles, customs, ceremonies by which a [[Maharaja]] or [[Nawab]] were installed&amp;nbsp;... the exchange of official presents&amp;nbsp;... the order of precedence", for example, were "all inherited from&amp;nbsp;... the Emperors of Delhi".&lt;ref name="Indian Princes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Charles|authorlink = Charles Allen (writer)|last2 = Dwivedi|first2=Sharada|authorlink2 = Sharada Dwivedi|title=Lives of the Indian Princes|year=1984|publisher=Century Publishing|location=London|isbn=0-7126-0910-5|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea, the "court entertainment dance" was "originally performed in the palace for entertainment at court banquets."&lt;ref name="Van Zile"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Van Zile|first=Judy|title=Perspectives on Korean Dance|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, Connecticut|isbn=0-8195-6494-X}} p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Court entertainment often moved from being associated with the court to more general use among [[commoner]]s. This was the case with "masked dance-dramas" in Korea, which "originated in conjunction with village [[Shamanism|shaman]] rituals and eventually became largely an entertainment form for commoners".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=9}} [[Nautch]] dancers in the Mughal Empire performed in Indian courts and palaces. Another evolution, similar to that from courtly entertainment to common practice, was the transition from religious ritual to secular entertainment, such as happened during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty with the Narye festival. Originally "solely religious or ritualistic, a secular component was added at the conclusion".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=69}} Former courtly entertainments, such as [[jousting]], often also survived in children's games.

In some courts, such as those during the [[Byzantine Empire]], the genders were segregated among the upper classes, so that "at least before the period of the [[Komnenos|Komnenoi]]" (1081–1185) men were separated from women at ceremonies where there was entertainment such as receptions and banquets.&lt;ref name=Garland&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Lynda|title=Byzantine Women: Varieties of Experience 800–1200|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Aldershot, Hampshire|isbn=978-0-7546-5737-8|pages=177–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court ceremonies, palace banquets and the spectacles associated with them, have been used not only to entertain but also to demonstrate wealth and power. Such events reinforce the relationship between ruler and ruled; between those with power and those without, serving to "dramatise the differences between ordinary families and that of the ruler".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}} This is the case as much as for traditional courts as it is for contemporary ceremonials, such as the [[Hong Kong handover ceremony]] in 1997, at which an array of entertainments (including a banquet, a parade, fireworks, a festival performance and an art spectacle) were put to the service of highlighting a change in political power. Court entertainments were typically performed for royalty and courtiers as well as "for the pleasure of local and visiting dignitaries".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} Royal courts, such as the Korean one, also supported traditional dances.{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} In Sudan, musical instruments such as the so-called "slit" or "talking" drums, once "part of the court orchestra of a powerful chief", had multiple purposes: they were used to make music; "speak" at ceremonies; mark community events; send long-distance messages; and call men to hunt or war.&lt;ref name="Slit Drum"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=Episode 94: Sudanese Slit Drum (Transcript)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode94/|work=History of the World in 100 Objects|publisher=BBC Radio 4/British Museum|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGregor&gt;{{cite book|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=A History of the World in 100 objects|year=2010|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=978-1-84614-413-4|pages=613–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/FMgugdskR7eaWj_ST2fAeQ British Museum catalogue image of Sudanese slit drum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtly entertainments also demonstrate the complex relationship between entertainer and spectator: individuals may be either an entertainer or part of the audience, or they may swap roles even during the course of one entertainment. In the court at the [[Palace of Versailles]], "thousands of courtiers, including men and women who inhabited its apartments, acted as both performers and spectators in daily rituals that reinforced the status hierarchy".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}}

Like court entertainment, royal occasions such as coronations and weddings provided opportunities to entertain both the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and the people. For example, the splendid 1595 [[Accession Day]] celebrations of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] offered [[tournament]]s and jousting and other events performed "not only before the assembled court, in all their finery, but also before thousands of Londoners eager for a good day's entertainment. Entry for the day's events at the [[Tiltyard]] in [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] was set at [[History of the English penny (1485–1603)#Elizabeth I|12d]]".&lt;ref name=Bevington&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-59436-7|author=Holbrook, Peter|editor=Bevington, David|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public punishment ===
[[File:Ticket for the execution of Jonathan Wild.jpg|thumb|160px|Ticket for the execution of [[Jonathan Wild]] (1725)]]
Although most forms of entertainment have evolved and continued over time, some once-popular forms are no longer as acceptable.  For example, during earlier centuries in Europe, watching or participating in the punishment of criminals or social outcasts was an accepted and popular form of entertainment. Many forms of [[public humiliation]] also offered local entertainment in the past. Even capital punishment such as [[hanging]] and [[Decapitation|beheading]], offered to the public as a warning, were also regarded partly as entertainment. Capital punishments that lasted longer, such as [[stoning]] and [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawing and quartering]], afforded a greater public spectacle. "A hanging was a carnival that diverted not merely the unemployed but the unemployable. Good bourgeois or curious aristocrats who could afford it watched it from a carriage or rented a room."&lt;ref name=Gay/&gt; Public punishment as entertainment lasted until the 19th century by which time "the awesome event of a public hanging aroused the[ir] loathing of writers and philosophers".&lt;ref name=Gay&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Peter Gay|last=Gay|first=Peter|title=Schnitzler's Century – The making of middle-class culture 1815–1914|year=2002|publisher=W.W.

{{Main article|Play (activity)}}
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 041b.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'' (1560)]]

Children's entertainment is centred on [[Play (activity)|play]] and is significant for their growth. Entertainment is also provided to children or taught to them by adults and many activities that appeal to them such as [[puppet]]s, [[clown]]s, [[pantomime]]s and [[cartoon]]s are also enjoyed by adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=John|title=Harlequin Britain: Pantomime and Entertainment, 1690–1760|year=2004|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7910-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geipel|first=John|title=The cartoon: a short history of graphic comedy and satire|year=1972|publisher=Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles|isbn=0-7153-5328-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children have always played games. It is accepted that as well as being entertaining, playing games helps children's development. One of the most famous visual accounts of children's games is a painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] called ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'', painted in 1560. It depicts children playing a range of games that presumably were typical of the time. Many of these games, such as [[Marble (toy)|marbles]], [[hide-and-seek]], blowing [[soap bubble]]s and [[Piggy-back (transportation)|piggyback riding]] continue to be played.

[[File:Israel Rating.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Example of a rating system specifying age appropriateness (Israel)]]
Most forms of entertainment can be or are modified to suit children's needs and interests. During the 20th century, starting with the often criticised but nonetheless important work of [[G. Stanley Hall]], who "promoted the link between the study of development and the 'new' laboratory psychology",&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Thompson |first1=Dennis |last2=Hogan |first2=John D. |last3=Clark |first3=Philip M. |title=Developmental Psychology in Historical Perspective |year=2012 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts; Oxford |isbn=978-1-4051-6747-5 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and especially with the work of [[Jean Piaget]], who "saw cognitive development as being analogous to biological development",{{sfnp|Thompson|2012|p=114}} it became understood that the [[Developmental psychology|psychological development]] of children occurs in stages and that their capacities differ from adults. Hence, stories and activities, whether in books, film, or video games were developed specifically for child audiences. Countries have responded to the special needs of children and the rise of digital entertainment by developing systems such as [[television content rating systems]], to guide the public and the [[entertainment industry]].

In the 21st century, as with adult products, much entertainment is available for children on the internet for private use. This constitutes a significant change from earlier times. The amount of time expended by children indoors on screen-based entertainment and the "remarkable collapse of children's engagement with nature" has drawn criticism for its negative effects on [[imagination]], adult [[cognition]] and [[Subjective well-being|psychological well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cobb|first=Edith|title=The ecology of imagination in childhood|year=1977|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-03870-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louv|first=Richard|title=[[Last Child in the Woods]]: saving our children from nature-deficit disorder|year= 2005|publisher=Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|isbn=1-56512-391-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature"&gt;{{cite news|last=Monbiot|first=George|title=If children lose contact with nature they won't fight for it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Banquets ===
[[Banquet]]s have been a venue for entertainment since ancient times, continuing until the 21st century, when they are still being used for many of their original purposes{{snd}} to impress visitors, especially important ones ('''4''', '''6''', '''9'''); to show hospitality ('''2''', '''4''', '''8'''); as an occasion to showcase supporting entertainments such as music or dancing, or both ('''2''', '''3'''). They were an integral part of court entertainments ('''3''', '''4''') and helped entertainers develop their skills ('''2''', '''3'''). They are also important components of celebrations such as coronations ('''9'''), weddings ('''7'''), [[birthday]]s ('''10''') civic or political achievements ('''5'''), military engagements or victories ('''6''') as well as religious obligations ('''1'''). In modern times, banquets are commercially available, for example, in restaurants ('''10''') and combined with a performance in [[dinner theater|dinner theatres]]. Cooking by professional [[chef]]s has also become a form of entertainment as part of global competitions such as the [[Bocuse d'Or]].

=== Music ===
{{Main article|Music}}
[[File:A full house, seen from the rear of the stage, at the Metropolitan Opera House for a concert by pianist Josef Hofmann, 1 - NARA - 541890.tif|thumb|left|A full house at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City, waiting for a musical entertainment to begin (1937)]]
Music is a supporting component of many kinds of entertainment and most kinds of performance. For example, it is used to enhance storytelling, it is indispensable in dance ('''1''', '''4''') and opera, and is usually incorporated into dramatic film or theatre productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Paul|title=A concise history of western music|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-84294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music is also a universal and popular type of entertainment on its own, constituting an entire performance such as when [[concert]]s are given ('''2''', '''4''', '''5''', '''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9''' ). Depending on the [[rhythm]], [[Musical instrument|instrument]], performance and style, music is divided into many genres, such as [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[Folk music|folk]], ('''4''', '''5''', '''8'''), [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music]] ('''6''', '''9''') or traditional ('''1''', '''3'''). Since the 20th century, performed music, once available only to those who could pay for the performers, has been available cheaply to individuals by the entertainment industry, which broadcasts it or pre-records it for sale.

The wide variety of musical performances, whether or not they are artificially [[Amplifier|amplified]] ('''6''', '''7''', '''9''', '''10'''), all provide entertainment irrespective of whether the performance is from [[Solo (music)|soloists]] ('''6'''), [[Choir|choral]] ('''2''') or [[orchestra|orchestral groups]] ('''5''', '''8'''), or [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] ('''3'''). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation ('''5''', '''8'''). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate ('''7''', '''9'''). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately ('''10''').

The instruments used in musical entertainment are either solely the [[human voice]] ('''2''', '''6''') or solely instrumental ('''1''', '''3''') or some combination of the two ('''4''', '''5''', '''7''', '''8'''). Whether the performance is given by [[Singing|vocalists]] or [[Musician|instrumentalists]], the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual ('''10'''), passing by ('''3'''), small ('''1''', '''2''') or large ('''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9'''). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably [[a cappella]] and [[overtone singing]], are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing ('''7''').

=== Games ===
{{Main article|Game}}
Games are played for entertainment—sometimes purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a [[World Chess Championship|chess championship]]. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.

Equipment varies with the game. [[Board game]]s, such as [[Go (game)|Go]], ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' or [[backgammon]] need a board and markers. One of the oldest known board games is [[Senet]], a game played in Ancient Egypt, enjoyed by the [[pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Botermans|first=Jack|title=The Book of Games: Strategy, Tactics &amp; History|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Pub Co Inc|isbn=1-4027-4221-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Card game]]s, such as [[whist]], [[poker]] and [[Contract bridge|Bridge]] have long been played as evening entertainment among friends. For these games, all that is needed is a deck of [[playing card]]s. Other games, such as [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]], played with numerous strangers, have been organised to involve the participation of non-players via [[gambling]]. Many are [[children's game|geared for children]], and can be played outdoors, including [[hopscotch]], [[hide and seek]], or [[Blind man's bluff (game)|Blind man's bluff]]. The [[list of ball games]] is quite extensive. It includes, for example, [[croquet]], [[lawn bowling]] and [[paintball]] as well as many sports using various forms of [[ball]]s. The options cater to a wide range of skill and fitness levels. Physical games can develop agility and competence in [[motor skill]]s. Number games such as [[Sudoku]] and puzzle games like the [[Rubik's cube]] can develop mental prowess.

[[History of video games|Video games]] are played using a controller to create results on a screen. They can also be played online with participants joining in remotely. In the second half of the 20th century and in the 21st century the number of such games increased enormously, providing a wide variety of entertainment to players around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Digital Games|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London; California; New Delhi|isbn=1-4129-0033-6|author=Bryce, Jo|editor=Rutter, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=James|title=Videogames|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London; New York|isbn=0-203-64290-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video games are popular in [[East Asia]]n countries such as South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Dal Yong|title=Korea's Online Gaming Empire|year=2010|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=978-0-262-01476-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French poet [[Louise Labé]] (1520/1522–1566) wrote "a profound and timeless insight into reading's innate power".

''The past gives us pleasure and is of more service than the present; but the delight of what we once felt is dimly lost never to return and its memory is as distressing as the events themselves were then delectable&amp;nbsp;... But when we happen to put our thoughts in writing, how easily, later on, does our mind race through an infinity of events, incessantly alive, so that a long time afterwards when we take up those written pages we can return to the same place and to the same disposition in which we once found ourselves.'' &lt;br&gt;quote from and commentary by Fischer (2003)&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Steven Roger|title=A history of reading|year=2003|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=1-86189-160-1|ref=harv|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Saint [[Teresa of Ávila]] (1515–1582) read chivalrous novels and wrote about the "rapture" that books provided.

''I became accustomed to reading [novels] and that small fault made me cool my desire and will to do other tasks. I thought nothing of spending many hours a day and night in this vain exercise, hidden from my father. My rapture in this was so great, that unless I had a new book to read, it seemed to me that I could not be happy.'' &lt;br&gt; quoted in Fischer (2003){{sfnp|Fischer|2003|pp=234–35}}
}}

[[Reading (process)|Reading]] has been a source of entertainment for a very long time, especially when other forms, such as performance entertainments, were (or are) either unavailable or too costly. Even when the primary purpose of the writing is to inform or instruct, reading is well known for its capacity to distract from everyday worries. Both stories and information have been passed on through the tradition of [[orality]] and oral traditions survive in the form of [[performance poetry]] for example. However, they have drastically declined. "Once literacy had arrived in strength, there was no return to the oral prerogative."{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=215}} The advent of printing, the reduction in costs of books and an increasing literacy all served to enhance the mass appeal of reading. Furthermore, as [[font]]s were standardised and texts became clearer, "reading ceased being a painful process of decipherment and became an act of pure pleasure".{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=212}} By the 16th century in Europe, the appeal of reading for entertainment was well established.

Among [[literature]]'s many genres are some designed, in whole or in part, purely for entertainment. [[Limerick (poetry)|Limericks]], for example, use verse in a strict, predictable rhyme and rhythm to create humour and to amuse an audience of listeners or readers. Interactive books such as "[[choose your own adventure]]" can make literary entertainment more participatory.

[[File:Goscinny (scenarist van de strips Asterix en Lucky Luke) (l) en Morris (tekenaar, Bestanddeelnr 924-5894.jpg|thumb|Readers entertained by comic books (1971)]]
[[Comics]] and cartoons are literary genres that use drawings or graphics, usually in combination with text, to convey an entertaining narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=James|title=British comics: a cultural history|year=2011|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-86189-855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary comics have elements of [[fantasy]] and are produced by companies that are part of the [[entertainment industry]]. Others have unique authors who offer a more personal, philosophical view of the world and the problems people face. Comics about [[superheroes]] such as [[Superman]] are of the first type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Mike|title=Superhero comics of the Golden Age: the illustrated history|year= 1992|publisher=Taylor Publishing|location=Dallas, Texas|isbn=0-87833-808-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the second sort include the individual work over 50 years  of [[Charles M. Schulz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/charles-m-schulz-on-cartooning/ "Charles M. Schulz on Cartooning", ''Hogan's Alley'' #1, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; who produced a popular comic called ''[[Peanuts]]''&lt;ref&gt;Films have been made of the ''Peanuts'' cartoons, including one [[The Peanuts Movie|released in 2015]] to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the comic strip.&lt;/ref&gt; about the relationships among a cast of child characters;&lt;ref&gt;The philosophical and theological implications of Schulz's work were explored in: {{cite book|last=Short|first=Robert L.|title=The Gospel According to Peanuts|year=1965|publisher=John Knox Press|location=Westminster|isbn=0-664-22222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Leunig]] who entertains by producing whimsical cartoons that also incorporate [[social criticism]]. The Japanese [[Manga]] style differs from the western approach in that it encompasses a wide range of genres and themes for a readership of all ages. [[Caricature]] uses a kind of graphic entertainment for purposes ranging from merely putting a smile on the viewer's face, to raising social awareness, to highlighting the moral characteristics of a person being caricatured.

{{Main article|Comedy}}
[[File:Dictator charlie3.jpg|thumb|Comedian [[Charlie Chaplin]] impersonating [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] for comic effect in the [[satire|satirical]] film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940)]]
[[Comedy]] is both a [[genre]] of entertainment and a component of it, providing laughter and amusement, whether the comedy is the sole purpose or used as a form of contrast in an otherwise serious piece. It is a valued contributor to many forms of entertainment, including in literature, theatre, opera, film and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roston|first=Murray|title=The comic mode in English literature: from the Middle Ages to today|year=2011|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9588-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grindon|first=Leger|title=The Hollywood romantic comedy: conventions, history, controversies|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-4051-8266-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In royal courts, such as in the Byzantine court, and presumably, also in its wealthy households, "[[Mime artist|mimes]] were the focus of orchestrated humour, expected or obliged to make fun of all at court, not even excepting the emperor and members of the imperial family.

Shakespeare wrote seventeen [[Shakespearean comedy|comedies]] that incorporate many techniques still used by performers and writers of comedy—such as [[joke]]s, [[pun]]s, [[parody]], [[wit]], [[observational humor]], or the unexpected effect of [[irony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Penny|title=The Cambridge introduction to Shakespeare's comedies|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=978-0-521-85668-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=David|title=Shakespeare's practical jokes: an introduction to the comic in his work|year=2007|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-8387-5680-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[One-liner joke]]s and satire are also used to comedic effect in literature.

=== Performance ===
{{Main|Performance}}
Live performances before an audience constitute a major form of entertainment, especially before the invention of audio and video recording. Performance takes a wide range of forms, including theatre, music and drama. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European royal courts presented [[masque]]s that were complex theatrical entertainments involving dancing, singing and acting. Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three forms, demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration and like the masque, production expertise as well.

[[File:Aida poster colors fixed.jpg|center|thumb|550px|Poster for a 1908 production of [[Verdi]]'s 1871 opera ''[[Aida]]'', performed by the Hippodrome Opera Company of Cleveland, Ohio]]
Audiences generally show their appreciation of an entertaining performance with applause. However, all performers run the risk of failing to hold their audience's attention and thus, failing to entertain. Audience dissatisfaction is often brutally honest and direct.

==== Storytelling ====
{{Main|Storytelling}}
Storytelling is an ancient form of entertainment that has influenced almost all other forms. It is "not only entertainment, it is also thinking through human conflicts and contradictions".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Hence, although stories may be delivered directly to a small listening audience, they are also presented as entertainment and used as a component of any piece that relies on a narrative, such as film, drama, ballet, and opera. Written stories have been enhanced by illustrations, often to a very high artistic standard, for example, on [[illuminated manuscript]]s and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones.&lt;ref name=Watanabe&gt;{{cite book|last=Watanabe|first=Masako|title=Storytelling in Japanese Art|year=2011|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=978-0-300-17590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories remain a common way of entertaining a group that is on a journey. Showing how stories are used to pass the time and entertain an audience of travellers, [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] used [[pilgrim]]s in his literary work ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the 14th century, as did Wu Cheng'en in the 16th century in ''[[Journey to the West]]''. Even though journeys can now be completed much faster, stories are still told to passengers en route in cars and aeroplanes either orally or delivered by some form of technology.

The power of stories to entertain is evident in one of the most famous ones—[[Scheherazade]]—a story in the [[Iran|Persian]] professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yamanaka|first=Yuriko|title=The Arabian nights and orientalism: perspectives from East &amp; West|year=2006|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London; New York|author2=Nishio, Tetsuo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Sir Richard (1821–1890) (in English)|title=Arabian nights. A plain and literal translation of the Arabian nights' entertainments: now entitled The book of the thousand and one nights |year=1958|publisher=Barker|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arabian nights in English literature : studies in the reception of The thousand and one nights into British culture|year=1988|publisher=Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|isbn=0-333-36693-X|editor=Caracciolo, Peter L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Shéhérazade (Ravel)|Ravel]] and [[Karol Szymanowski|Szymanowski]] have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini|Pasolini]] made a [[Arabian Nights (1974 film)|film adaptation]]; and there is an [[The Magic of Scheherazade|innovative video game]] based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of [[wayang]], in which the performance is accompanied by a [[gamelan]] orchestra or the similarly traditional [[Punch and Judy]] show.

Epic narratives, poems, [[saga]]s and [[allegory|allegories]] from all cultures tell such gripping tales that they have inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment. Examples include the Hindu ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''; [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]''; the first Arabic novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]''; the Persian epic ''[[Shahnameh]]''; the [[Sagas of Icelanders]] and the celebrated ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of the Genji]]''. Collections of stories, such as ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' or those by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], have been similarly influential. Originally published in the early 19th century, this collection of folk stories significantly influence modern popular culture, which subsequently used its themes, images, symbols, and structural elements to create new entertainment forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rankin|first=Walter|title=Grimm pictures: fairy tale archetypes in eight horror and suspense films|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3174-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most powerful and long-lasting stories are the foundation stories, also called [[myth of origin|origin]] or [[creation myth]]s such as the [[Dreamtime]] myths of the [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian aborigines]], the Mesopotamian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The epic of Gilgamesh: the Babylonian epic poem and other texts in Akkadian and Sumerian (English –  translated from Akkadian and Sumerian by Andrew George)|year=1999|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=0-7139-9196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Hawaiian stories of the origin of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Vivian Laubach|title=Hawaiian Myths of Earth, Sea, and Sky|year=1966|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-1171-2|author2=Kahalewai, Marilyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; These too are developed into books, films, music and games in a way that increases their longevity and enhances their entertainment value.

[[File:G Durand Saturday Night at the Victoria Theatre VA.jpg|thumb|Saturday night audience at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre|Victoria Theatre]], London (1872)]]
[[Theatre]] performances, typically dramatic or musical, are presented on a stage for an audience and have a history that goes back to [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic times]] when "leading musicians and actors" performed widely at "poetical competitions", for example at "[[Delphi]], [[Delos]], [[Ephesus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|title=The Cambridge companion to Greek and Roman theatre|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-83456-2|editors=McDonald, Marianne and Walton, J. Michael}} p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] and his teacher [[Plato]] both wrote on the theory and purpose of theatre. Aristotle posed questions such as "What is the function of the arts in shaping character? Should a member of the ruling class merely watch performances or be a participant and perform? What kind of entertainment should be provided for those who do not belong to the elite?"{{sfnp|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|McDonald &amp; Walton|2007|p=93}} The "Ptolemys in Egypt, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] in [[Pergamon|Pergamum]]" also had a strong theatrical tradition and later, wealthy patrons in Rome staged "far more lavish productions".{{sfnp|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|McDonald &amp; Walton|2007|p=26}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of British Theatre|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press (3 volumes)|isbn=0-521-82790-6|editors=Milling, Jane; Donohue, Joseph W.; Thomson, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expectations about the performance and their engagement with it have changed over time ('''1''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenrick|first=John|title=Musical theatre: a history|year=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=0-8264-2860-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in England during the 18th century, "the prejudice against actresses had faded"&lt;ref name=Ackroyd&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ackroyd|first=Peter|title=London: The Biography|year=2000|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=0-385-49771-7}} p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Europe generally, going to the theatre, once a socially dubious activity, became "a more respectable middle-class pastime"&lt;ref name=Frame&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Frame|first=Murray|title=The St. Petersburg Imperial Theaters: Stage and State in Revolutionary Russia, 1900–1920|year=2000|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co, Inc.

The stage and the spaces set out in front of it for an audience create a theatre. All types of stage are used with all types of seating for the audience, including the impromptu or improvised ('''2''', '''3''', '''6'''); the temporary ('''2'''); the elaborate ('''9'''); or the traditional and permanent ('''5''', '''7'''). They are erected indoors ('''3''', '''5''', '''9''') or outdoors ('''2''', '''4''', '''6'''). The skill of managing, organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as [[stagecraft]] ('''10'''). The audience's experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations, the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating provided.

==== Cinema and film ====
{{Main|Film}}
[[File:Munken kino (kinolerret).jpg|thumb|left|Film audiences are typically seated in comfortable chairs arranged in close rows before a projection screen. Norway (2005)]]

[[Film]]s are a major form of entertainment, although not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: [[documentary film]], for example, aims to create a record or inform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wyver|first=John|title=The Moving Image: An International History of Film, Television, and Video|year=1989|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Limited|isbn=0-631-16821-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning: "The [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] were the first to send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public."&lt;ref name=Paris&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFParis1999|title=The First World War and popular Cinema|year=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-8135-2824-0|editor=Paris, Michael}} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, [[Pathé]] launched and distributed [[Pathé News|newsreels]]&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; and by [[World War I]], films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. "In the first decade of the [20th] century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms."&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; The Americans first "contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images," but "the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle".{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=115}} Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences. [[Animation]], for example, which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cavalier|first=Stephen|title=The world history of animation|year= 2011|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-26112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) in the 21st century made it "possible to do spectacle" more cheaply and "on a scale never dreamed of" by [[Cecil B. DeMille]].&lt;ref name=Byrnes&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Pompeii, Noah and Exodus: The sword giveth again|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/pompeii-noah-and-exodus-the-sword-giveth-again-20140327-35jm4.html|work=Film|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1930s to 1950s, movies and radio were the "only mass entertainment" but by the second decade of the 21st century, technological changes, economic decisions, risk aversion and globalisation reduced both the quality and range of films being produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Losing the plot|last = Byrnes|first = Paul|date = 12 December 2015|work = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = |via = |pages = 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophisticated [[visual effects]] and CGI techniques, for example, rather than humans, were used not only to create realistic images of people, landscapes and events (both real and [[Fantasy|fantastic]]) but also to animate non-living items such as [[Lego]] normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form.&lt;ref name=Maddox&gt;{{cite web|last=Maddox|first=Garry|title=The Lego Movie: Hit off the old block | url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-lego-movie-hit-off-the-old-block-20140327-35jek.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators of ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' "wanted the audience to believe they were looking at actual Lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera, not what we actually did, which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside the computer."&lt;ref name=Maddox/&gt; The convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and the technology has also allowed for those with the personal resources to screen films in a [[home cinema|home theatre]], recreating in a private venue the quality and experience of a public theatre. This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries.

Films also re-imagine entertainment from other forms, turning stories, books and plays, for example, into new entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=Kenneth S.|title=A History of Shakespeare on Screen: A Century of Film and Television|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-59404-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Story of Film: An Odyssey|The Story of Film]]'', a documentary about the [[history of film]], gives a survey of global achievements and innovations in the medium, as well as changes in the conception of film-making. It demonstrates that while some films, particularly those in the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] tradition that combines "realism and [[melodrama]]tic romanticism",{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=17}} are intended as a form of [[escapism]], others require a deeper engagement or more thoughtful response from their audiences. For example, the award winning Senegalese film ''[[Xala]]'' takes government corruption as its theme. [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' was a brave and innovative parody, also on a political theme. Stories that are thousands of years old, such as [[Noah (2014 film)|''Noah'']], have been re-interpreted in film, applying familiar [[literary devices]] such as allegory and [[personification]] with new techniques such as CGI to explore big themes such as "human folly", good and evil, courage and despair, love, faith, and death{{snd}} themes that have been a main-stay of entertainment across all its forms.&lt;ref name=Byrnes2&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Noah review: Moments of brilliance but can't shake sinking feeling  |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/noah-review-moments-of-brilliance-but-cant-shake-sinking-feeling-20140327-35jm3.html|work=Review|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other media, excellence and achievement in films is recognised through a range of awards, including ones from the  American [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], the [[Cannes International Film Festival]] in France and the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]].

==== Dance ====
{{Main|Dance}}
[[File:Peterborough Snow Ball 2008 silent video.ogg|left|thumb|Dancers creating their own entertainment at a ball. &lt;br&gt; Peterborough (2008) (silent video)]]
The many forms of [[dance]] provide entertainment for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be serious in tone, such as when it is used to express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines many forms of entertainment{{snd}} music, movement, storytelling, theatre{{snd}} it provides a good example of the various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.

Dance is "a form of cultural representation" that involves not just dancers, but "[[Choreography (dance)|choreographers]], audience members, [[Patronage|patrons]] and [[impresario]]s&amp;nbsp;... coming from all over the globe and from vastly varied time periods."&lt;ref name="Dils"&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFDilsAlbright2001|title=Moving History/Dancing Cultures: A Dance History Reader|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=0-8195-6412-5|author=Albright, Ann Cooper|editor=Dils, Ann}} p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether from Africa, Asia or Europe, dance is constantly negotiating the realms of political, social, spiritual and artistic influence."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} Even though dance traditions may be limited to one cultural group, they all develop. For example, in Africa, there are "[[Dahomey|Dahomean]] dances, [[Hausa people|Hausa]] dances, [[Maasai people|Masai]] dances and so forth."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=34}} [[Ballet]] is an example of a highly developed Western form of dance that moved to the theatres from the French court during the time of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the dancers becoming professional theatrical performers.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Clarke|first=Mary|title=The history of dance|year=1981|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-517-54282-X}} p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Some dances, such as the [[quadrille]], a square dance that "emerged during the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic years]] in France"{{sfnp|Clarke|1981|p=97}} and other [[country dance]]s&lt;ref name="Wilson2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=An Analysis of Country Dancing|date=1808|publisher=W. Calvert}}&lt;/ref&gt; were once popular at social gatherings like [[Ball (dance)|balls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fullerton|first=Susannah|title=A Dance with [[Jane Austen]]: How a Novelist and Her Characters Went to the Ball|year=2012|publisher=Pgw|isbn=0-7112-3245-8|author2=Le Faye, Deirdre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=The Treasures of Terpsichore: or, A Companion for the Ball-Room|date=1816|publisher=Sherwood, Neely and Jones|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now rarely performed. On the other hand, many [[folk dance]]s (such as [[Scottish highland dance|Scottish Highland dancing]] and [[Irish dance|Irish dancing]]), have evolved into competitions, which by adding to their audiences, has increased their entertainment value. "Irish dance theatre, which sometimes features traditional Irish steps and music, has developed into a major dance form with an international reputation."&lt;ref name="Wulff"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wulff|first=Helena|title=Dancing at the Crossroads: Memory and Mobility in Ireland|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-328-2|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since dance is often "associated with the female body and women's experiences",{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} female dancers, who dance to entertain, have in some cases been regarded as distinct from "decent" women because they "use their bodies to make a living instead of hiding them as much as possible".{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=142}} Society's attitudes to female dancers depend on the culture, its history and the entertainment industry itself. For example, while some cultures regard any dancing by women as "the most shameful form of entertainment",&lt;ref&gt;van Nieuwkerk, Karin. "Changing Images and Shifting Identities: Female Performers in Egypt" in Dils &amp; Albright (2001). p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; other cultures have established venues such as [[strip clubs]] where deliberately erotic or sexually provocative dances such as [[striptease]] are performed in public by professional women dancers for mostly male audiences.

Various political regimes have sought to control or ban dancing or specific types of dancing, sometimes because of disapproval of the music or clothes associated with it. Nationalism, authoritarianism and racism have played a part in banning dances or dancing. For example, during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime, American dances such as [[Swing (dance)|swing]], regarded as "completely un-German", had "become a public offense and needed to be banned".&lt;ref name="Karina"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karina|first=Lilian|title=Hitler's Dancers: German Modern Dance and the Third Reich|year=1999|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=1-57181-300-4|page=174|edition=English language|others=Translated by Jonathan Steinberg|author2=Kant, Marion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Shanghai, China, in the 1930s, "dancing and nightclubs had come to symbolise the excess that plagued Chinese society" and officials wondered if "other forms of entertainment such as [[brothel]]s" should also be banned. Banning had the effect of making "the dance craze" even greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Field |first=Andrew David |title=Shanghai's Dancing World: Cabaret Culture and Urban Politics, 1919–1954 |year=2010 |publisher=The Chinese University of Hong Kong |location=Sha Tin, Hong Kong |isbn=978-962-996-373-6 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, the Public Dance Hall Act of 1935 "banned{{snd}} but did not stop{{snd}} dancing at the crossroads and other popular dance forms such as house and [[barn dance]]s."&lt;ref name="Wulff" /&gt; In the US, various dances were once banned, either because like [[burlesque]], they were suggestive,&lt;ref name="Butters"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butters|first=Gerald R.|title=Banned in Kansas: Motion Picture Censorship, 1915–1966|year=2007|publisher=University of Missouri Press|location=Columbia|isbn=978-0-8262-1749-3|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because, like the [[Twist (dance)|Twist]], they were associated with [[African American]]s.&lt;ref name="Pruter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruter|first=Robert|title=Chicago Soul|year=1991|publisher=University of Illinois|isbn=0-252-06259-0|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; "African American dancers were typically banned from performing in [[minstrel show]]s until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]."&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Constance Valis|title=Tap Dancing America: A Cultural History|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539082-7|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dances can be performed [[Solo (dance)|solo]] ('''1''', '''4'''); in pairs, ('''2''', '''3'''); in groups, ('''5''', '''6''', '''7'''); or by massed performers ('''10'''). They might be improvised ('''4''', '''8''') or highly choreographed ('''1''', '''2''', '''5''', '''10'''); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, ('''4'''); a paying audience ('''2'''); a world audience ('''10'''); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre ('''3''', '''5'''). They might be a part of a celebration, such as a [[wedding]] or [[New Year]] ('''6''', '''8'''); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by [[warrior]]s like a [[haka]] ('''7'''). Some dances, such as traditional dance in '''1''' and ballet in '''2''', need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the [[can-can]], require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves ('''9''').

==== Animals ====
Animals have been used for the purposes of entertainment for millennia. They have been hunted for entertainment (as opposed to hunted for food); displayed while they hunt for prey; watched when they compete with each other; and watched while they perform a trained routine for human amusement. The Romans, for example, were entertained both by competitions involving wild animals and acts performed by trained animals. They watched as "lions and bears danced to the music of pipes and [[cymbal]]s; horses were trained to kneel, bow, dance and prance&amp;nbsp;... acrobats turning handsprings over wild lions and vaulting over wild leopards." There were "violent confrontations with wild beasts" and "performances over time became more brutal and bloodier".&lt;ref name="St Leon"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=St Leon|first=Mark|title=Circus: the Australian story|year=2011|publisher=Melbourne Books|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-1-877096-50-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals that perform trained routines or "acts" for human entertainment include fleas in [[flea circus]]es, dolphins in [[Dolphinarium|dolphinaria]], and monkeys doing tricks for an audience on behalf of the player of a [[street organ]]. Animals kept in [[zoo]]s in ancient times were often kept there for later use in the arena as entertainment or for their entertainment value as exotica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hancocks|first=David|title=A different nature: the paradoxical world of zoos and their uncertain future|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-23676-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contests between animals are now regarded as sports{{snd}} for example, [[horse racing]] is regarded as both a sport and an important source of entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on [[Melbourne Cup]] Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, [[camel racing]] requires human riders, while [[greyhound racing]] does not. People find it entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained, like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like [[Cockroach racing|cockroaches]].

The use of animals for entertainment is often controversial, especially the hunting of wild animals. Some contests between animals, once popular entertainment for the public, have become illegal because of the cruelty involved. Among these are [[blood sport]]s such as [[bear-baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[cockfighting]]. Other contests involving animals remain controversial and have both supporters and detractors. For example, the conflict between opponents of pigeon shooting who view it as "a cruel and moronic exercise in marksmanship, and proponents, who view it as entertainment" has been tested in a court of law.&lt;ref name=Bronner&gt;An extensive discussion of the legal and cultural issues can be found in {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bronner|first=Simon J.|title=Killing Tradition: Inside Hunting and Animal Rights Controversies|year=2008|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2528-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox hunting]], which involves the use of horses as well as hounds, and [[bullfighting]], which has a strong theatrical component, are two entertainments that have a long and significant cultural history. They both involve animals and are variously regarded as sport, entertainment or cultural tradition&lt;!--don't use 'either' nor 'and/or' in this sentence; 'variously' is used in conjunction with 'or' to mean they're regarded as one, two or three of these things--&gt;. Among the organisations set up to advocate for the rights of animals are some whose concerns include the use of animals for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: [http://www.league.org.uk/ The League against Cruel Sports, UK]; [http://www.peta.org/ People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), multinational]; and [http://www.sharkonline.org/ Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK), US].&lt;/ref&gt; However, "in many cases of animal advocacy groups versus organisations accused of animal abuse, both sides have cultural claims."{{sfn|Bronner|2008}}

==== Circus ====
{{Main|Circus}}
[[File:Cirque Soleil Stilt 1.jpg|thumb|Children entertained by a [[stilts|stilt]] walker performing in a circus act]]

A [[circus]], described as "one of the most brazen of entertainment forms",&lt;ref name=Stoddart&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoddart|first=Helen|title=Rings of Desire: Circus History and Representation|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK &amp; New York|page=13|isbn=0-7190-5233-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a special type of theatrical performance, involving a variety of physical skills such as [[acrobatics]] and [[juggling]] and sometimes performing animals. Usually thought of as a travelling show performed in a [[wikt:big top|big top]], circus was first performed in permanent venues. [[Philip Astley]] is regarded as the founder of the modern circus in the second half of the 18th century and [[Jules Léotard]] is the French performer credited with developing the art of the [[trapeze]], considered synonymous with circuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Michael|title=Victorian sensation, or, The spectacular, the shocking, and the scandalous in nineteenth-century Britain|year=2003|publisher=Anthem Press|location=London|isbn=1-84331-076-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astley brought together performances that were generally familiar in traditional British fairs "at least since the beginning of the 17th century": "tumbling, rope-dancing, juggling, animal tricks and so on".&lt;ref name=Stoddart/&gt; It has been claimed that "there is no direct link between the Roman circus and the circus of modern times.&amp;nbsp;... Between the demise of the Roman 'circus' and the foundation of Astley's Amphitheatre in London some 1300 years later, the nearest thing to a circus ring was the rough circle formed by the curious onlookers who gathered around the itinerant tumbler or juggler on a [[village green]]."{{sfnp|St Leon|2011}}

==== Magic ====
{{Main|Magic (illusion)}}
The form of entertainment known as [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] or conjuring and recognisable as performance, is based on traditions and texts of magical rites and dogmas that have been a part of most cultural traditions since ancient times. (References to magic, for example, can be found in the [[Bible]], in [[Hermeticism]], in [[Zoroastrianism]], in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition, in [[mysticism]] and in the sources of [[Freemasonry]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lévi|first=Éliphas|title=The History of Magic ''(originally published in 1860 as'' Histoire de la Magie ''English edition, translated by A.E. Waite in 1913)''|year=2001|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=0-87728-929-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage magic is performed for an audience in a variety of media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and [[showmanship (performing)|showmanship]] is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, [[psychological manipulation]], sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the [[stunt performer|stunt performances]] and [[Escapology|escape acts]] of [[Harry Houdini]], for example, regarded him as a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Houdini: the man who walked through walls  | author1=Gresham, William Lindsay  | year=1959  | publisher=Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=The Great Houdini: magician extraordinary  | author1=Epstein, Beryl| author2=Epstein, Sam  | year=1971  | location = Folkestone| publisher=Bailey Brothers and Swinfen (Reprint.

[[Magician (fantasy)|Fantasy magicians]] have held an important place in literature for centuries, offering entertainment to millions of readers. Famous wizards such as [[Merlin]] in the [[Arthurian legends]] have been written about since the 5th and 6th centuries, while in the 21st century, the young wizard [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] became a global entertainment phenomenon when the book series about him sold about 450 million copies (as at June 2011), making it the [[List of book series|best-selling book series in history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rowling 'makes £5 every second'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7649962.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Potter series to be sold as e-books|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13889578|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Street performance ====
[[File:Didgeridoo street player.jpg|thumb|[[Didgeridoo]] player entertaining passers by in the street]]

Street entertainment, [[street performance]] or "busking" are forms of performance that have been meeting the public's need for entertainment for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David|title=The buskers: a history of street entertainment|year= 1981|publisher=David &amp; Charles|location=Newton Abbot; North Pomfret, Vermont|isbn=0-7153-8026-5|author2=Greenwood, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "an integral aspect of London's life", for example, when the city in the early 19th century was "filled with spectacle and diversion".{{sfnp|Ackroyd|2000|p=346 (caption to plate following text pages)}} [[Minstrel]]s or [[troubadour]]s are part of the tradition. The art and practice of busking is still celebrated at annual busking festivals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.coffsharbourbuskers.com/ 2012 Coffs Harbour International Buskers and Comedy Festival].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three basic forms of contemporary street performance. The first form is the "circle show". It tends to gather a crowd, usually has a distinct beginning and end, and is done in conjunction with [[street theatre]], [[puppeteer]]ing, [[magician (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, acrobats, [[juggler]]s and sometimes [[musician]]s. This type has the potential to be the most lucrative for the performer because there are likely to be more donations from larger audiences if they are entertained by the act. Good buskers control the crowd so patrons do not obstruct foot traffic. The second form, the ''walk-by act'', has no distinct beginning or end. Typically, the busker provides an entertaining ambience, often with an unusual instrument, and the audience may not stop to watch or form a crowd. Sometimes a walk-by act spontaneously turns into a circle show. The third form, ''café busking'', is performed mostly in restaurants, pubs, bars and cafés. This type of act occasionally uses [[public transport]] as a venue.

==== Parades ====
{{Main|Parade}}
[[Parade]]s are held for a range of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are designed to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. [[Cavalcade]]s and the modern variant, the [[motorcade]], are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the [[Trooping the Colour]] in '''8''') and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.

One of the earliest forms of parade were "[[Roman triumph|triumphs]]"{{snd}} grand and sensational displays of foreign treasures and spoils, given by triumphant Roman generals to celebrate their victories. They presented conquered peoples and nations that exalted the prestige of the victor. "In the summer of 46&amp;nbsp;[[Before common era|BCE]] [[Julius Caesar]] chose to celebrate four triumphs held on different days extending for about one month."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurval|first=Robert Alan|title=Actium and Augustus: The Politics and Emotions of Civil War|year=1995|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=0-472-10590-6|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe from the Middle Ages to the [[Baroque]] the [[Royal Entry]] celebrated the formal visit of the monarch to the city with a parade through elaborately decorated streets, passing various shows and displays. The annual [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in London is an example of a civic parade that has survived since medieval times.

Many religious festivals (especially those that incorporate [[processions]], such as [[Holy Week procession]]s or the Indian festival of [[Holi]]) have some entertainment appeal in addition to their serious purpose. Sometimes, religious rituals have been adapted or evolved into secular entertainments, or like the [[Festa del Redentore]] in Venice, have managed to grow in popularity while holding both secular and sacred purposes in balance. However, [[pilgrimage]]s, such as the Christian pilgrimage of the [[Way of St. James]], the Muslim [[Hajj]] and the Hindu [[Kumbh Mela]], which may appear to the outsider as an entertaining parade or procession, are not intended as entertainment: they are instead about an individual's spiritual journey. Hence, the relationship between spectator and participant, unlike entertainments proper, is different. The manner in which the Kumbh Mela, for example, "is divorced from its cultural context and repackaged for Western consumption{{snd}} renders the presence of [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]] deeply problematic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maclean|first=Kama|title=Pilgrimage and Power: The Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, 1765–1954|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533894-2|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parades generally impress and delight often by including unusual, colourful costumes ('''7, 10'''). Sometimes they also commemorate ('''5''', '''8''') or celebrate ('''1''', '''4, 6,''' '''8''', '''9'''). Sometimes they have a serious purpose, such as when the context is military ('''1''', '''2''', '''5'''), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or have a role to play ('''6''', '''7, 10'''). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away ('''9'''), it is likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.

==== Fireworks ====
{{Main|Fireworks}}
[[File:Medellín-Juegos pirotécnicos bicentenario-11.jpg|thumb|Spectators at Bicentennial [[fireworks]] in Colombia]]

[[Fireworks]] are a part of many public entertainments and have retained an enduring popularity since they became a "crowning feature of elaborate celebrations" in the 17th century. First used in China, classical antiquity and Europe for military purposes, fireworks were most popular in the 18th century and high prices were paid for [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnists]], especially the skilled Italian ones, who were summoned to other countries to organise displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Giacomo Casanova|last=Casanova|first=Giacomo Chevalier de Seingalt|title=History of My Life, Volumes 9–10 Vol 10|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland; London|isbn=0-8018-5666-3|page=333|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Jack|title=Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World|year=2005|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-03722-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire and water were important aspects of court spectacles because the displays "inspired by means of fire, sudden noise, smoke and general magnificence the sentiments thought fitting for the subject to entertain of his sovereign: awe fear and a vicarious sense of glory in his might. Birthdays, name-days, weddings and anniversaries provided the occasion for celebration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany 1648–1914|year=2003|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-7658-0982-7|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous courtly uses of fireworks was one used to celebrate the end of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and while the fireworks themselves caused a fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Christopher Hogwood|last=Hogwood|first=Christopher|title=Handel: Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83636-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; the accompanying [[Music for the Royal Fireworks]] written by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] has been popular ever since. Aside from their contribution to entertainments related to military successes, courtly displays and personal celebrations, fireworks are also used as part of religious ceremony. For example, during the Indian [[Dashavatar]]a Kala of Gomantaka "the temple deity is taken around in a procession with a lot of singing, dancing and display of fireworks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varadpande|first=Manohar Laxman|title=History of Indian Theatre (vol. 2)|year=1992|publisher=Shakti Malik Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7017-278-0|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "fire, sudden noise and smoke" of fireworks is still a significant part of public celebration and entertainment. For example, fireworks were one of the primary forms of display chosen to celebrate the turn of the [[millennium]] around the world. As the clock struck midnight and 1999 became 2000, firework displays and open-air parties greeted the [[New Year]] as the [[time zone]]s changed over to the next century. Fireworks, carefully planned and choreographed, were let off against the backdrop of many of the world's most famous buildings, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] in Egypt, the [[Acropolis]] in Athens, [[Red Square]] in Moscow, [[Vatican City]] in Rome, the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in Berlin, the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, and [[Elizabeth Tower]] in London.

=== Sport ===
{{Main|Sport}}
[[File:Tifosi fiorentina.jpg|thumb|Tifosi fiorentina|Audience engagement from a crowd of Italian sport fans]]
[[File:2010 FIFA World Cup Fans.jpg|thumb|Audience engagement by individual South African fans at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] ]]

[[Sports|Sporting]] competitions have always provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the players from the audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in [[stadium]] and [[auditorium]] design, as well as in recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and [[spectator sport]] has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are [[association football]] and [[cricket]]. Their ultimate international competitions, the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and [[test cricket]], are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sport Marketing|year=2007|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-6052-3|authors=Hardy, Stephen; Sutton, William Anthony|editor=Mullin, Bernard James}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the [[Tour de France]], unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Christopher S.|title=The Tour de France: A Cultural History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles; London|isbn=978-0-520-25630-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from sports that have world-wide appeal and competitions, such as the [[Olympic Games]], the entertainment value of a sport depends on the culture and country where people play it. For example, in the United States, [[baseball]] and [[basketball]] games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is [[rugby union]]; in Iran, it is [[freestyle wrestling]]. Japan's unique [[sumo]] wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kubota|first=Makoto|title=Sumo|year=1999|publisher=Chronicle Books Llc|isbn=0-8118-2548-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as the international running group [[Hash House Harriers]], participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component is more important than the competitive.

The evolution of an activity into a sport and then an entertainment is also affected by the local climate and conditions. For example, the modern sport of [[History of surfing|surfing]] is associated with Hawaii and that of [[History of skiing|snow skiing]] probably evolved in Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators have spread around the world, people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport such as in the case of [[ice hockey]]—an important entertainment in Canada.

=== Fairs, expositions, shopping ===
{{Main|Fair|World's fair}}
[[Fair]]s and exhibitions have existed since ancient and medieval times, displaying wealth, innovations and objects for trade and offering specific entertainments as well as being places of entertainment in themselves.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Robert|title=Great Exhibitions: The World Fairs 1851–1937|year=2007|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|isbn=978-0-7241-0284-6|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether in a medieval market or a small shop, "shopping always offered forms of exhilaration that took one away from the everyday".&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite book|last=Moss|first=Mark Howard|title=Shopping as an Entertainment Experience|year=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland; Plymouth, UK|page=3|isbn=978-0-7391-1680-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the modern world, "merchandising has become entertainment: spinning signs, flashing signs, thumping music&amp;nbsp;... video screens, interactive computer kiosks, day care .. cafés".&lt;ref name=Moss/&gt;

By the 19th century, "expos" that encouraged arts, manufactures and commerce had become international. They were not only hugely popular but affected international ideas. For example, the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris Exposition]] facilitated international cooperation about ideas, innovations and standards. From London 1851 to Paris 1900, "in excess of 200 million visitors had entered the turnstiles in London, Paris, Vienna, Philadelphia, Chicago and a myriad of smaller shows around the world."&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Colombian Exposition of 1893|url=http://columbus.gl.iit.edu/|publisher=Chicago Illinois Institute of Technology|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[World War II]] "well over 500 million visits have been recorded through world expo turnstiles".&lt;ref name=Boisseau&gt;{{cite book|title=Gendering the Fair: Histories of Women and Gender at World's Fairs|year=2010|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-252-03558-6|authors=Rydell, Robert; Boisseau, T.J.; Markwyn, Abigail M.; Rydell, Robert W.|editor=Boisseau, T.J.|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of spectacle and entertainment, expositions influenced "everything from architecture, to patterns of globalisation, to fundamental matters of human identity"&lt;ref name=Boisseau/&gt; and in the process established the close relationship between "fairs, the rise of department stores and art museums",&lt;ref name=Rydell&gt;{{cite book|last=Rydell|first=Robert W.|title=World of Fairs: The Century-of-Progress Expositions|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-73236-3|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the modern world of mass consumption and the entertainment industry.

== Safety ==
Some entertainments, such as at large festivals (whether religious or secular), concerts, clubs, parties and celebrations, involve big crowds. From earliest times, crowds at an entertainment have associated hazards and dangers, especially when combined with the recreational consumption of [[Recreational drug use|intoxicants]] such as alcohol. The Ancient Greeks had [[Dionysian Mysteries]], for example, and the Romans had [[Saturnalia]]. The consequence of excess and crowds can produce breaches of [[Norm (social)|social norms]] of behaviour, sometimes causing injury or even death, such as for example, at the [[Altamont Free Concert]], an outdoor [[rock festival]]. The list of [[Nightclub#Serious incidents|serious incidents at nightclubs]] includes those caused by [[stampede]]; overcrowding; terrorism, such as the [[2002 Bali bombings]] that targeted a nightclub; and especially fire. Investigations, such as that carried out in the US after [[The Station nightclub fire]] often demonstrate that lessons learned "regarding fire safety in nightclubs" from earlier events such as the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] do "not necessarily result in lasting effective change".&lt;ref name=Tubbs&gt;{{cite book|last=Tubbs|first=Jeffrey|title=Egress Design Solutions: A Guide to Evacuation and Crowd Management Planning|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-71956-4|page=83|author2=Meacham, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to prevent such incidents include appointing special officers, such as the medieval [[Lord of Misrule]] or, in modern times, [[security officers]] who control access; and also ongoing improvement of relevant [[International Organization for Standardization|standards]] such as those for building safety. The [[tourism]] industry now regards safety and security at entertainment venues as an important management task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Tourism, security and safety: from theory to practice | author1=Mansfeld, Yoel  | author2=Pizam, Abraham  | date = 2006 |location = Burlington, Mass.|publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann  | isbn=0750678984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
Although kings, rulers and powerful people have always been able to pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein|first=Andi|title=An Introduction to the Entertainment Industry|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4331-0341-4|author2=Evans, Beth Bingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Key issues in the arts and entertainment industry|publisher=Goodfellow Publishers |location=Woodeaton, Oxford|isbn=1-906884-20-X|editor=Walmsley, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as [[show business]], the industry relies on [[business model]]s to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sickels|first=Robert C|title=The Business of Entertainment|publisher=Greenwood Publishing (Three Volumes)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Harold L.|title=Entertainment industry economics: a guide for financial analysis|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-87485-8|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[film industry]] is a part of the entertainment industry. Components of it include the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/hollywood|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mid Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/bollywood|publisher=Mid Day|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; film industries, as well as the [[cinema of the United Kingdom]] and all the [[Cinema of Europe|cinemas of Europe]], including [[cinema of France|France]], [[cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[cinema of Spain|Spain]], [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Casper|first=Drew|title=Postwar Hollywood, 1946–1962|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4051-5074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sex industry]] is another component of the entertainment industry, applying the same forms and media (for example, film, books, dance and other performances) to the development, marketing and sale of sex products on a commercial basis.

[[Amusement park]]s entertain paying guests with [[rides]], such as [[roller coasters]], [[ridable miniature railway]]s, [[water rides]], and [[dark rides]], as well as other events and associated attractions. The parks are built on a large area subdivided into themed areas named "lands". Sometimes the whole amusement park is based on one theme, such as the various [[SeaWorld]] parks that focus on the theme of sea life.

One of the consequences of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of [[employment]]. While jobs such as [[writer]], musician and [[composer]] exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] or [[special effect]]s supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.

Prestigious [[List of prizes, medals, and awards|awards are given by the industry]] for excellence in the various types of entertainment. For example, there are awards for Music, Games (including video games), Comics, Comedy, Theatre, Television, Film, Dance and Magic. Sporting awards are made for the results and skill, rather than for the entertainment value.

== Architecture ==

=== Architecture for entertainment ===
Purpose-built structures as venues for entertainment that accommodate audiences have produced many famous and innovative buildings, among the most recognisable of which are [[Theatre (structure)|theatre structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhouse|first=Victoria|title=Site and sound: the architecture and acoustics of new opera houses and concert halls|year=2012|publisher=Monacelli Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58093-281-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Greeks, "the architectural importance of the theatre is a reflection of their importance to the community, made apparent in their monumentality, in the effort put into their design, and in the care put into their detail."&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;Green, J.R. "The Theatre of Paphos and the Theatre of Alexandria: Some First Thoughts" in {{cite book |title=The Library of Alexandria |year=2002 |publisher=The American University in Cairo Press |location=Cairo |isbn=977-424-710-8 |editor=MacLeod, Roy}} p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans subsequently developed the stadium in an oval form known as a [[Circus (building)|circus]]. In modern times, some of the grandest buildings for entertainment have brought fame to their cities as well as their designers. The [[Sydney Opera House]], for example, is a [[World Heritage Site]] and [[The O₂ (London)|The O₂]] in London is an entertainment precinct that contains an indoor [[arena]], a music club, a cinema and exhibition space. The [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]] in Germany is a theatre designed and built for performances of one specific musical composition.

Two of the chief architectural concerns for the design of venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The speed at which the venue empty is important both for amenity and safety, because large crowds take a long time to disperse from a badly designed venue, which creates a safety risk. The [[Hillsborough disaster]] is an example of how poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. [[Sightline]]s and [[acoustics]] are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.

In the 21st century, entertainment venues, especially stadia, are "likely to figure among the leading architectural genres".&lt;ref name=Sheard&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheard|first=Rod|title=Sports Architecture|year=2001|publisher=Spon Press|location=London|isbn=0-419-21220-5|ref=CITEREFSheard2001}} p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they require "a whole new approach" to design, because they need to be "sophisticated entertainment centres, multi-experience venues, capable of being enjoyed in many diverse ways".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}} Hence, architects now have to design "with two distinct functions in mind, as sports and entertainment centres playing host to live audiences, and as sports and entertainment studios serving the viewing and listening requirements of the remote audience".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

=== Architecture as entertainment ===
[[File:Sleepingbeautycastle50.jpg|[[Sleeping Beauty]]|thumb|left|Inauthentic castle in [[Disneyland]] amusement park]]
Architects who push the boundaries of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed the expectations of the public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]], designed by [[Frank Gehry]], are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really [[folly|follies]], deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.

On the other hand, sometimes architecture is entertainment, while pretending to be functional. The tourism industry, for example, creates or renovates buildings as "attractions" that have either never been used or can never be used for their ostensible purpose. They are instead re-purposed to entertain visitors often by simulating cultural experiences. Buildings, history and sacred spaces are thus made into commodities for purchase. Such intentional tourist attractions divorce buildings from the past so that "the difference between historical authenticity and contemporary entertainment venues/theme parks becomes hard to define".&lt;ref name=Lasansky&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFLasansky2004|last=Lasansky|first=D. Medina|title=Architecture and Tourism: Perception, Performance and Place|year=2004|edition=English|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=1-85973-709-9|author2=McLaren, Brian}} p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include "the preservation of the [[Alcázar of Toledo]], with its grim Civil War History, the conversion of slave dungeons into tourist attractions in Ghana, [such as, for example, [[Cape Coast Castle]]] and the presentation of indigenous culture in Libya".{{sfnp|Lasansky|2004|p=xvii, Part II, Ch. 4, 5, 6}} The specially constructed buildings in amusement parks represent the park's theme and are usually neither authentic nor completely functional.

== Effects of developments in electronic media ==

=== Globalisation ===
By the second half of the 20th century, developments in electronic [[Media (communication)|media]] made possible the delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across the globe. The technology enabled people to see, hear and participate in all the familiar forms{{snd}} stories, theatre, music, dance{{snd}} wherever they live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in [[data storage device]]s such as [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] or [[compact disc]]s, along with increasing [[miniaturisation]]. Computerisation and the development of [[barcodes]] also made ticketing easier, faster and global.

=== Obsolescence ===
In the 1940s, [[radio]] was the electronic medium for family entertainment and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garratt|first=G.R.M.|title=The early history of radio: from Faraday to Marconi|year=1994|publisher=Institution of Electrical Engineers, in association with the Science Museum|location=London|isbn=0-85296-845-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radio reader: essays in the cultural history of radio|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-92820-6|editor1=Hilmes, Michele |editor2=Loviglio, Jason }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Jim|title=The great radio sitcoms|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3146-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, it was [[television]] that was the new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing visual entertainment, first in black and white, then in colour, to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spigel|first=Lynn|title=Make room for TV: television and the family ideal in postwar America|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-76966-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, [[history of video games|games]] could be played electronically, then [[Handheld video game|hand-held]] devices provided mobile entertainment, and by the last decade of the 20th century, via [[online game|networked play]]. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The "proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption" together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films.&lt;ref name=Tryon&gt;{{cite book|last=Tryon|first=Chuck|title=Reinventing Cinema: Movies in the Age of Media Convergence|year=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|pages=6, 9|isbn=978-0-8135-4546-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid [[obsolescence]] of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Television after TV: Essays on a Medium in Transition|year=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3383-X|editors=Spigel, Lynn; Olsson, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a [[Wii]] console, "about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953".&lt;ref name=Cogburn&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogburn|first=Jon|title=Philosophy Through Video Games|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-98857-8|page=i|author2=Silcox, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced television—which didn't happen. The so-called "[[digital revolution]]" has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all try to keep up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Gillian|title=Media Ownership: The Economics and Politics of Convergence and Concentration in the UK and European Media|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|format=Google eBook|isbn=0-7619-6680-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=John|title=Scheduling: the last creative act in television?|journal=Media Culture Society|date=January 2000|volume=22|series=Bournemouth University/Large Door Productions|issue=1|pages=25–38|doi=10.1177/016344300022001002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the UK: {{cite web|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|title=Government thinktank to tackle media convergence issues|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 November 2012|date=21 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;And for example, in Australia: {{cite web|title=Convergence Review|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|date=30 April 2012|publisher=Australian Government: Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy|accessdate=23 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly compete with television viewing "...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available."{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=49}} Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes, where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as "professional engagers" shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{cite news|last=Power|first=Julie|title=Laughter and music better than drugs for dementia patients|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/laughter-and-music-better-than-drugs-for-dementia-patients-20130802-2r4w9.html|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergence ===
By the second decade of the 21st century, [[analogue recording]] was being replaced by [[digital recording]] and all forms of electronic entertainment began to [[technological convergence|converge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwyer|first=Tim|title=Media Convergence|year=2010|publisher=Open University Press McGraw-Hill Education|location=Maidenhead, Berkshire, England and New York|isbn=978-0-335-22873-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, convergence is challenging standard practices in the film industry: whereas "success or failure used to be determined by the first weekend of its run. Today,&amp;nbsp;... a series of exhibition 'windows', such as DVD, pay-per-view, and fibre-optic video-on-demand are used to maximise profits."{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=156}} Part of the industry's adjustment is its release of new commercial product directly via video hosting services. Media convergence is said to be more than technological: the convergence is cultural as well.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|pp=22, 30 ''ff''}} It is also "the result of a deliberate effort to protect the interests of business entities, policy institutions and other groups".&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt; Globalisation and [[cultural imperialism]] are two of the cultural consequences of convergence.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=30}} Others include [[fandom]] and interactive storytelling as well as the way that single franchises are distributed through and affect a range of delivery methods.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|title=Convergence culture: where old and new media collide|year=2006|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-4281-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "greater diversity in the ways that signals may be received and packaged for the viewer, via terrestrial, satellite or cable television, and of course, via the Internet" also affects entertainment venues, such as sports stadia, which now need to be designed so that both live and remote audiences can interact in increasingly sophisticated ways{{snd}} for example, audiences can "watch highlights, call up statistics", "order tickets and merchandise" and generally "tap into the stadium's resources at any time of the day or night".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

The introduction of television altered the availability, cost, variety and quality of entertainment products for the public and the convergence of online entertainment is having a similar effect. For example, the possibility and popularity of user-generated content, as distinct from commercial product, creates a "networked audience model [that] makes programming obsolete".{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=536}} Individuals and corporations use [[video hosting service]]s to broadcast content that is equally accepted by the public as legitimate entertainment.

While technology increases demand for entertainment products and offers increased speed of delivery, the forms that make up the content are in themselves, relatively stable. Storytelling, music, theatre, dance and games are recognisably the same as in earlier centuries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3387">'''Environmental stewardship''' refers to responsible use and protection of the [[natural environment]] through [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and [[Sustainability|sustainable]] practices. [[Aldo Leopold]] (1887–1949) championed environmental stewardship based on a [[land ethic]] "dealing with man's relation to land and to the animals and plants which grow upon it."&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo. 1949. ''A Sand County Almanac''. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resilience-Based Ecosystem Stewardship==
Resilience-Based Ecosystem Stewardship emphasizes [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] as a basic feature of the changing world as well as [[ecosystems]] that provide a suite of [[ecosystem services]] rather than a single [[resource]], and [[stewardship]] that recognizes [[Resource management|resource managers]] as an integral part of the systems they manage.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, F. Stuart III, Gary P. Kofinas, and Carl Folke (eds). 2009. ''Principles of Ecosystem Stewardship: Resilience-Based Natural Resource Management in a Changing World''. Springer. {{ISBN|978-0387730325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Resilience refers to the ability of a system to absorb [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] and still maintain its basic function and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Brian, and David Salt. 2006.

==Different types of environmental stewards==
{{tone|Section|date=January 2018}}
One author suggests that there are 3 types of environmental stewards: doers, donors, and practitioners. Doers go out and help the cause by taking action. For example, the doers in an oil spill would be the volunteers that go along the beach and help clean up the oil from the beaches. A donor is the person that financially helps the cause. They can do anything from donating their money, to hosting public events to raise funds. They are typically governmental agencies. Lastly there are practitioners. They work on a day-to-day basis to  steer governmental agencies, scientists, stakeholder groups, or any other group toward a stewardship outcome. Together these 3 groups make up environmental stewards and with the help keep the ecosystem running healthily.&lt;ref&gt;Increasing Capacity for Stewardship of Oceans and Coasts, P. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Anybody can be an environmental steward by being aware and knowledgeable of the world around them and making sure they do as little as possible to negatively impact our world. Without these groups it would be hard to get any sort of sustainability in our increasingly industrially based world. &lt;ref&gt;[[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]]. (2008). ''Increasing Capacity for Stewardship of Oceans and Coasts.'' The National Academic Press, 500 Fifth Street, NW Washington DC 20001.&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical study examining the face inversion effect would have images of the inverted and upright object presented to participants and time how long it takes them to recognise that object as what it actually is (i.e. a picture of a face as a face). The face inversion effect occurs when, compared to other objects, it takes a disproportionately longer time to recognise faces when they are inverted as opposed to upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farah|first=M.

Faces are normally processed in the special face-selective regions of the brain, such as the [[fusiform face area]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kanwisher|first=Nancy|last2=Yovel|first2=Galit|date=2006-12-29|title=The fusiform face area: a cortical region specialized for the perception of faces 9|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |volume=361|issue=1476|pages=2109–2128|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1934 |pmc=1857737|pmid=17118927}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, processing inverted faces involves both face-selective regions and the scene and object recognition regions of the [[Parahippocampal Place Area|parahippocampal place area]] and lateral [[occipital cortex]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There seems to be something different about inverted faces that requires them to also involve these scene and object processing mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pitcher|first=David|last2=Duchaine|first2=Bradley|last3=Walsh|first3=Vincent|last4=Yovel|first4=Galit|last5=Kanwisher|first5=Nancy|date=2011|title=The role of lateral occipital face and object areas in the face inversion effect|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.08.020|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=49|issue=12|pages=3448–3453|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.08.020|issn=0028-3932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most supported explanation for why faces take longer to recognise when they are inverted is the configural information hypothesis. The configural information hypothesis states that faces are processed with the use of configural information to form a [[holistic]] (whole) representation of a face. Objects, however, are not processed in this configural way. Instead, they are processed featurally (in parts). Inverting a face disrupts configural processing, forcing it to instead be processed featurally like other objects. This causes a delay since it takes longer to form a representation of a face with only local information.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Neural systems of face recognition ==
[[File:Fusiform Face Area.png|thumb|Location of the Fusiform Face Area]]Faces are processed in separate areas of the brain to other stimuli, such as scenes or non-facial objects. For example, the [[fusiform face area]] (FFA) is a face-selective region in the brain that is only used for facial processing.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The FFA responds more to upright but not inverted faces, demonstrating that inverted faces are not detected the same way that upright faces are.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yovel|first=Galit|last2=Kanwisher|first2=Nancy|date=2005|title=The Neural Basis of the Behavioral Face-Inversion Effect|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982205014107|journal=Current Biology|volume=15|issue=24|pages=2256–2262|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.10.072|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene-selective [[Parahippocampal gyrus|parahippocampal place area]] (PPA) processes places, or scenes of the visual environment.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Russell|last2=Kanwisher|first2=Nancy|date=1998|title=A cortical representation of the local visual environment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/33402|journal=Nature|volume=392|issue=6676|pages=598–601|doi=10.1038/33402|pmid=9560155|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object recognition area in the lateral [[occipital cortex]] (LOC) is involved in the processing of objects.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malach|first=R|last2=Reppas|first2=J B|last3=Benson|first3=R R|last4=Kwong|first4=K K|last5=Jiang|first5=H|last6=Kennedy|first6=W A|last7=Ledden|first7=P J|last8=Brady|first8=T J|last9=Rosen|first9=B R|date=1995-08-29|title=Object-related activity revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging in human occipital cortex.|pmc=41110|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=92|issue=18|pages=8135–8139|issn=0027-8424|pmid=7667258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these regions are used to process inverted, but not upright faces. This suggests that there is something special about inverted compared to upright faces that requires them to involve object and scene processing regions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is still some activity in face recognition regions when viewing inverted faces.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haxby|first=James V|last2=Ungerleider|first2=Leslie G|last3=Clark|first3=Vincent P|last4=Schouten|first4=Jennifer L|last5=Hoffman|first5=Elizabeth A|last6=Martin|first6=Alex|date=1999|title=The Effect of Face Inversion on Activity in Human Neural Systems for Face and Object Perception|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80690-x|journal=Neuron|volume=22|issue=1|pages=189–199|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80690-x|issn=0896-6273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence has found that a face-selective region in the brain known as the [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] face area (OFA) is involved in the processing of both upright and inverted faces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Overall, face and object processing mechanisms seem to be separate in the brain. Recognising upright faces involves special facial recognition regions, but recognising inverted faces involves both face and non-facial stimuli recognition regions.

== Face vs. object recognition processes ==

=== Face recognition ===

==== Configural information ====
Configural information, also known as relational information, helps people to quickly recognise faces. It involves the arrangement of [[facial feature]]s, such as the [[eye]]s and [[nose]]. There are two types of configural information: first-order relational information and second-order relational information.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Civile|first=Ciro|last2=McLaren|first2=Rossy|last3=McLaren|first3=Ian P. L.|date=2016|title=The Face Inversion Effect: Roles of First and Second-Order Configural Information|jstor=10.5406/amerjpsyc.129.1.0023|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|volume=129|issue=1|pages=23–35|doi=10.5406/amerjpsyc.129.1.0023|pmid=27029104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-order relational information consists of the spatial relationships between different features of the face. These relationships between facial features are common to most people, for example, having the mouth located under the nose. First-order relational information therefore helps to identify a face as a face and not some other object.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Second-order relational information is the size of the relationships between the features of the face, relative to a prototype (a model of what a face should look like). This type of information helps to distinguish one face from another because it differs between different faces.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Holistic processing ====
The [[holistic]] processing of faces describes the perception of faces as wholes, rather than the sum of their parts. This means that facial features (such as the eyes or nose) are not explicitly represented in the brain on their own, rather, the entire face is represented.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=James W.|last2=Farah|first2=Martha J.|date=1993|title=Parts and wholes in face recognition|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14640749308401045|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=46|issue=2|pages=225–245|via=|doi=10.1080/14640749308401045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the configural information hypothesis of [[Face perception|face recognition]], recognising faces involves two stages that use configural information to form holistic representations of faces.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taubert|first=Jessica|last2=Apthorp|first2=Deborah|last3=Aagten-Murphy|first3=David|last4=Alais|first4=David|date=2011|title=The role of holistic processing in face perception: Evidence from the face inversion effect|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2011.04.002|journal=Vision Research|volume=51|issue=11|pages=1273–1278|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2011.04.002|issn=0042-6989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study demonstrated that face-selective activity in the brain was delayed when the configural information of faces was disrupted (for example, when faces were inverted).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1999-07-01|title=Spatio-temporal localization of the face inversion effect: an event-related potentials study|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051199000137|journal=Biological Psychology|volume=50|issue=3|pages=173–189|doi=10.1016/S0301-0511(99)00013-7|issn=0301-0511|last1=Rossion|first1=B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it took longer for the participants to recognise the faces they were viewing as faces and not other (non-facial) objects. The configural information explanation for facial recognition is therefore supported by the presence of the face inversion effect (a delay when faces are inverted).

==== Stages of face recognition ====
The first stage of recognising faces in the configural information hypothesis is first-level information processing. This stage uses first-order relational information to detect a face (i.e. to determine that a face is actually a face and not another object). Building a holistic representation of a face occurs at this early stage of face processing, to allow faces to be detected quickly.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The next stage, second-level information processing, distinguishes one face from another with the use of second-order relational information.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Object recognition ===
An inversion effect does not seem to occur for non-facial objects, suggesting that faces and other objects are not processed in the same way.

Face recognition involves configural information to process faces holistically. However, object recognition does not use configural information to form a holistic representation. Instead, each part of the object is processed independently to allow it to be recognised. This is known as a featural recognition method.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, an explicit representation of each part of the object is made, rather than a representation of the object as a whole.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

== Theories ==

=== Configural information hypothesis ===
According to the configural information hypothesis, the face inversion effect occurs because configural information can no longer be used to build a holistic representation of a face. Inverted faces are instead processed like objects, using local information (i.e. the individual features of the face) instead of configural information.

A delay is caused when processing inverted faces compared to upright faces. This is because the specific holistic mechanism (see [[#Holistic processing|holistic processing]]) that allows faces to be quickly detected is absent when processing inverted faces. Only local information is available when viewing inverted faces, disrupting this early recognition stage and therefore preventing faces from being detected as quickly. Instead, independent features are put together piece-by-piece to form a representation of the object (a face) and allow the viewer to recognise what it is.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freire|first=Alejo|last2=Lee|first2=Kang|last3=Symons|first3=Lawrence A|date=2000|title=The Face-Inversion Effect as a Deficit in the Encoding of Configural Information: Direct Evidence|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/10.1068/p3012|journal=Perception|volume=29|issue=2|pages=159–170|doi=10.1068/p3012|issn=0301-0066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternate hypotheses ===
Although the configural processing hypothesis is a popular explanation for the face inversion effect, there have been some challenges to this theory. In particular, it has been suggested that faces and objects are both recognised using featural processing mechanisms, instead of holistic processing for faces and featural processing for objects.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsuyoshi|first=Daisuke|last2=Morita|first2=Tomoyo|last3=Kochiyama|first3=Takanori|last4=Tanabe|first4=Hiroki C.|last5=Sadato|first5=Norihiro|last6=Kakigi|first6=Ryusuke|date=2015-03-11|title=Dissociable Cortical Pathways for Qualitative and Quantitative Mechanisms in the Face Inversion Effect|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/10/4268|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=35|issue=10|pages=4268–4279|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3960-14.2015|issn=0270-6474|pmid=25762673}}&lt;/ref&gt; The face inversion effect is therefore not caused by delay from faces being processed as objects. Instead, another element is involved. Two potential explanations follow.

==== Perceptual learning ====
[[Perceptual]] learning is a common alternative explanation to the configural processing hypothesis for the face inversion effect. According to the perceptual learning theory, being presented with a stimulus (for example, faces or cars) more often makes that stimulus easier to recognise in the future.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallis|first=Guy|date=2013|title=Toward a unified model of face and object recognition in the human visual system|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00497/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00497|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people are highly familiar with viewing upright faces. It follows that highly efficient mechanisms have been able to develop to the quick detection and identification of upright faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gold|first=J.|last2=Bennett|first2=P. J.|last3=Sekuler|first3=A. B.|date=1999|title=Signal but not noise changes with perceptual learning|url=https://dx.doi.org.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/10.1038/46027|journal=Nature|volume=402|issue=6758|pages=176–178|doi=10.1038/46027|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the face inversion effect would therefore be caused by an increased amount of experience with perceiving and recognising upright faces compared to inverted faces.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sekuler|first=Allison B|last2=Gaspar|first2=Carl M|last3=Gold|first3=Jason M|last4=Bennett|first4=Patrick J|date=2004|title=Inversion Leads to Quantitative, Not Qualitative, Changes in Face Processing|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2004.02.028|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=5|pages=391–396|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.02.028|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Face-scheme incompatibility ====
The face-scheme incompatibility model has been proposed in order to explain some of the missing elements of the configural information hypothesis. According to the model, faces are processed and assigned meaning by the use of schemes and prototypes.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rakover|first=Sam S.|date=2013-08-01|title=Explaining the face-inversion effect: the face–scheme incompatibility (FSI) model|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-013-0388-1|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=20|issue=4|pages=665–692|doi=10.3758/s13423-013-0388-1|issn=1069-9384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model defines a scheme as an abstract representation of the general structure of a face, including characteristics common to most faces (i.e. the structure of and relationships between facial features). A prototype refers to an image of what an average face would look like for a particular group (e.g. humans or monkeys). After being recognised as a face with the use of a scheme, new faces are added to a group by being evaluated for their similarity to that group's prototype.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

There are different schemes for upright and inverted faces: upright faces are more frequently viewed and thus have more efficient schemes than inverted faces. The face inversion effect is thus partly caused by less efficient schemes for processing the less familiar inverted form of faces.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This makes the face-scheme incompatibility model similar to the perceptual learning theory, because both consider the role of experience important in the quick recognition of faces.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Integration of theories ===
Instead of just one explanation for the face inversion effect, it is more likely that aspects of different theories apply. For example, faces could be processed with configural information but the role of experience may be important for quickly recognising a particular type of face (i.e. human or dog) by building schemes of this facial type.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Development ==
The ability to quickly detect and recognise faces was important in early human life, and is still useful today. For example, facial expressions can provide various signals important for [[communication]].&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Karen L.|last2=Cohn|first2=Jeffrey F.|date=2001|title=Human Facial Expressions as Adaptations: Evolutionary Questions in Facial Expression Research|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=Suppl 33|pages=3–24|doi=10.1002/ajpa.2001|issn=0002-9483|pmc= 2238342|pmid=11786989|doi-broken-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Alvin I.|last2=Sripada|first2=Chandra Sekhar|date=2005|title=Simulationist models of face-based emotion recognition|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2004.01.005|journal=Cognition|volume=94|issue=3|pages=193–213|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2004.01.005|pmid=15617671|issn=0010-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly efficient facial recognition mechanisms have therefore developed to support this ability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As [[human]]s get older, they become more familiar with upright human faces and continuously refine the mechanisms used to recognise them.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Passarotti|first=A.M.|last2=Smith|first2=J.|last3=DeLano|first3=M.|last4=Huang|first4=J.|date=2007|title=Developmental differences in the neural bases of the face inversion effect show progressive tuning of face-selective regions to the upright orientation|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.07.045|journal=NeuroImage|volume=34|issue=4|pages=1708–1722|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.07.045|issn=1053-8119}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process allows people to quickly detect faces around them, which helps with [[social interaction]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

By about the first year of life, [[infant]]s are familiar with faces in their upright form and are thus more prone to experiencing the face inversion effect. As they age, they get better at recognising faces and so the face inversion effect becomes stronger.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The increased strength of the face inversion effect over time supports the perceptual learning hypothesis, since more experience with faces results in increased susceptibility to the effect.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The more familiar a particular type of face (e.g. human or dog) is, the more susceptible one is to the face inversion effect for that face. This applies to both humans and other species. For example, older [[chimpanzee]]s familiar with human faces experienced the face inversion effect when viewing human faces, but the same result did not occur for younger chimpanzees familiar with chimpanzee faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=Christoph D.|last2=Rasch|first2=Malte J.|last3=Tomonaga|first3=Masaki|last4=Adachi|first4=Ikuma|date=2013-08-27|title=The face inversion effect in non-human primates revisited - an investigation in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)|url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep02504|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=3|issue=1|pages=2504|doi=10.1038/srep02504|issn=2045-2322|pmc=3753590|pmid=23978930}}&lt;/ref&gt; The face inversion effect was also stronger for [[dog]] faces when they were viewed by dog experts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This evidence demonstrates that familiarity with a particular type of face develops over time and appears to be necessary for the face inversion effect to occur.

== Exceptions ==
There are a number of conditions that may reduce or even eliminate the face inversion effect. This is because the mechanism used to recognise faces by forming holistic representations is absent or disrupted. This can cause faces to be processed the same way as other (non-facial) objects.  [[File:Prosopagnosia.jpg|thumb|Prosopagnosia: face blindness]]

=== Prosopagnosia ===
[[Prosopagnosia]] is a condition marked by an inability to recognise faces.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Busigny|first=Thomas|last2=Rossion|first2=Bruno|date=2010|title=Acquired prosopagnosia abolishes the face inversion effect|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2009.07.004|journal=Cortex|volume=46|issue=8|pages=965–981|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2009.07.004|issn=0010-9452}}&lt;/ref&gt; When those with prosopagnosia view faces, the [[fusiform gyrus]] (a facial recognition area of the brain) activates differently to how it would in someone without the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grüter|first=Thomas|last2=Grüter|first2=Martina|last3=Carbon|first3=Claus-Christian|date=2008|title=Neural and genetic foundations of face recognition and prosopagnosia|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1348/174866407X231001|journal=Journal of Neuropsychology|volume=2|issue=1|pages=79–97|doi=10.1348/174866407x231001|issn=1748-6645}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, non-facial object recognition areas (such as the [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] occipitotemporal [[extrastriate cortex]]) are activated when viewing faces, suggesting that faces and objects are processed similarly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Individuals with prosopagnosia can be unaffected or even benefit from face inversion in facial recognition tasks.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1995-07-01|title=The inverted face inversion effect in prosopagnosia: Evidence for mandatory, face-specific perceptual mechanisms|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004269899400273O|journal=Vision Research|volume=35|issue=14|pages=2089–2093|doi=10.1016/0042-6989(94)00273-O|issn=0042-6989|last1=Farah|first1=Martha J|last2=Wilson|first2=Kevin D|last3=Maxwell Drain|first3=H|last4=Tanaka|first4=James R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, they process upright faces featurally, like objects. Inverted faces are also processed featurally rather than holistically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avidan|first=Galia|last2=Tanzer|first2=Michal|last3=Behrmann|first3=Marlene|date=2011|title=Impaired holistic processing in congenital prosopagnosia |journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=49|issue=9|pages=2541–2552|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.05.002 |pmc=3137703|pmid=21601583}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates that there is no difference between the processing of upright and inverted faces, which explains why there is no disproportionate delay for recognising inverted faces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Autism Spectrum Disorder ===
Like those with prosopagnosia, individuals with [[Autism-spectrum disorder|autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD) do not use a configural processing mechanism to form a holistic representation of a face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Geest|first=J.N.|last2=Kemner|first2=C.|last3=Verbaten|first3=M.N.|last4=van Engeland|first4=H.|date=2002|title=Gaze behavior of children with pervasive developmental disorder toward human faces: a fixation time study|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/doi/abs/10.1111/1469-7610.00055|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|volume=43|issue=5|pages=669–678|doi=10.1111/1469-7610.00055|issn=0021-9630}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they tend to process faces with the use of local or featural information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behrmann|first=Marlene|last2=Avidan|first2=Galia|last3=Leonard|first3=Grace Lee|last4=Kimchi|first4=Rutie|last5=Luna|first5=Beatriz|last6=Humphreys|first6=Kate|last7=Minshew|first7=Nancy|date=2006|title=Configural processing in autism and its relationship to face processing |journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=44|issue=1|pages=110–129|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.04.002 |pmid=15907952}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the same featural mechanisms are used between processing upright faces, inverted faces, and objects. Consequentially, the face inversion effect is less likely to occur in those with ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falck-Ytter|first=Terje|date=2008|title=Face inversion effects in autism: a combined looking time and pupillometric study |journal=Autism Research|volume=1|issue=5|pages=297–306|doi=10.1002/aur.45 |pmid=19360681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is some evidence that the development of a holistic facial recognition mechanism in those with ASD is simply delayed, rather than missing. This would mean that there would actually be a difference between the processing of upright and inverted faces. Those with ASD may therefore eventually become susceptible to the face inversion effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hedley|first=Darren|last2=Brewer|first2=Neil|last3=Young|first3=Robyn|date=2014-10-31|title=The Effect of Inversion on Face Recognition in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/10.1007/s10803-014-2297-1|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|volume=45|issue=5|pages=1368–1379|doi=10.1007/s10803-014-2297-1|issn=0162-3257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdinand Lee Barnett''' (February 18, 1852 – March 11, 1936) was an African-American journalist, lawyer, and civil rights activist in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in the late Reconstruction era and after. He was a founding editor of ''[[The Chicago Conservator]]'' monthly in 1878. He was the third black person to be admitted to the Illinois bar and became a successful lawyer.

In 1895, he married [[Ida B. Wells]], a journalist and anti-lynching activist. In 1896, he became Illinois' first black assistant state's attorney. He was active in anti-lynching and civil rights and was called "one of the foremost citizens Chicago has ever had" by the ''[[Chicago Defender]]''.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"&gt;Finkelman, Paul, ed. ''Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present: From the Age of Segregation to the Twenty-first Century''. Oxford University Press, 2009. pp. 137&amp;ndash;138&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ferdinand Lee Barnett was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; His mother was a freewoman,&lt;ref name="judgeship"&gt;Negro Elected to Judgeship, ''San Francisco Chronicle'' (San Francisco, California) December 17, 1906, page 3, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653448//&lt;/ref&gt; Martha Brooks, born about 1825. His father, also named Ferdinand Lee Barnett, was born in Nashville about 1810 and worked as a blacksmith. He purchased his family's freedom the year Ferdinand was born. They lived in Nashville until about 1859, when they left the United States and moved to [[Windsor, Ontario]], across the Detroit River from Detroit, Michigan.&lt;ref name="goldenwedding"&gt;Golden Wedding of Colored Couple, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' (Chicago, Illinois), June 28, 1897, p. 5, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080536/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653492/golden_wedding_of_colored_couple/&lt;/ref&gt; They wanted to get beyond the reach of the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] of 1850, which had created incentives for slave catchers to kidnap free blacks and sell them into slavery.

The Barnett family returned to the US in 1869 after the American Civil War and the end of slavery, settling in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Ferdinand was educated in Chicago schools,&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; first attending the old Jones school at Clark and Harrison. He entered [[Chicago High School|Central High School]],&lt;ref name="judgeship"/&gt; graduating in 1874. After high school he taught in the southern United States for two years before returning to Chicago to attend Union College of Law, later a part of [[Northwestern Law School]]. Barnett graduated from law school and was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1878.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; He was the third black person to pass the Illinois bar, following [[Lloyd G. Wheeler]] and Richard A. Dawson.&lt;ref&gt;McCaul, Robert L. ''The Black Struggle for Public Schooling in Nineteenth-Century Illinois''. SIU Press, 2009. p100-101&lt;/ref&gt;

Numbered among his cousins were [[Ferdinand L. Barnett (Omaha)|Ferdinand L. Barnett]] and his brother [[Alfred S. Barnett]]. They were also journalists and lived in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and [[Des Moines, Iowa]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Alfreda Duster (1904–1983), Chicago, Illinois. Interviewed by: Marcia McAdoo Greenlee, March 8 and 9, 1978. Library, Harvard University, p 20 Accessed March 7, 2016 at http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/45168262?n=32&amp;printThumbnails=no&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnett's father died in early February 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Death of F. L. Barnett St, ''The Appeal'' (Saint Paul, Minnesota) February 5, 1898, p. 4, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6654458/death_of_f_l_barnett_st_the_appeal/&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died November 11, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[No Headline] ''The New York Age'' (New York, New York) November 19, 1908, p. 5, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653846/no_headline_the_new_york_age_new/&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Conservator'' and early activism ==
In December 1877, Barnett, along with co-editors Abram T. Hall, Jr. and James E. Henderson, organized the semi-monthly newspaper, the ''Conservator'', the first edition appearing on January 1, 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[No Headline] ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' (Chicago, Illinois) December 10, 1877, page 9, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://web.archive.org/web/20170917123353/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645582/no_headline_chicago_daily_tribune/&lt;/ref&gt; Also among the editors and stakeholders was Iowan [[Alexander Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. ''Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising.'' GM Rewell &amp; Company, 1887. p1100&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Chicago in 1884, where he served as an editor on the paper. (Clark was appointed as US ambassador to Liberia in 1891.)&lt;ref name="pioneer"&gt;[http://muscatinejournal.com/news/local/black-history-pioneer-alexander-clark-became-prominent-achiever-while-residing/article_66625acb-5714-519f-b6ee-96a031c5af75.html Connie Street, "Black history pioneer: Alexander Clark became prominent achiever while residing in Muscatine"], ''Muscatine Journal'', 24 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Conservator'' was a radical journal that focused on justice and equal rights, and Barnett was soon recognized as a local black leader. He was selected as a delegate to the [[Colored Conventions Movement|May 1879 National Conference of Colored Men]] in Nashville, where he gave a noted speech calling for unity and education.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; He was a delegate to the 1884 Inter-State Conference of Colored Men in [[Pittsburgh]],&lt;ref&gt;The Colored Men, ''Detroit Free Press'' (Detroit, Michigan), April 30, 1884, page 2, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645642/the_colored_men_detroit_free_press/&lt;/ref&gt; and the national convention of the [[Timothy Thomas Fortune]] led [[National Afro-American League|Afro-American League]] in Chicago in 1890 where he was named secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Afro-Americans, ''The Ottawa Daily Republic'' (Ottawa, Kansas) January 16, 1890, page 1, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645673/afroamericans_the_ottawa_daily/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal and political career ==
Barnett started practicing law around 1883.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; His prominence grew quickly and in 1888 he was considered for a Republican nomination for [[Cook County Board of Commissioners|Cook County Commissioner]].&lt;ref&gt;[No Headline], ''The Inter Ocean'' (Chicago, Illinois), September 12, 1888, page 4, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645703/no_headline_the_inter_ocean/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, he started a law partnership with [[S. Laing Williams]]. The pair split over Williams' affiliation with [[Booker T. Washington]], whom Barnett frequently opposed.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt;

=== Ida B. Wells ===
[[File:Cover Southern horrors.png|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases'']]
In 1892, three men, including a friend of Ida B. Wells, were [[lynching|lynched]] by a white mob while in police custody in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in an event known as the [[Peoples Grocery|Peoples Grocery lynching]]. The act sparked a national outcry and Barnett took part in meetings in Chicago called to organize reaction. At a meeting of one thousand people at Bethel A. M. E. Church, Reverend W. Gaines' call for the crowd to sing the then ''de facto'' national anthem, "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]", but the call was refused, one member of the audience declaring, "I don't want to sing that song until this country is what it claims to be, 'sweet land of liberty'".&lt;ref name=sing/&gt; Gaines substituted the Civil War-era song about the abolitionist martyr, "[[John Brown's Body]]". Barnett closed the meeting appealing for calm and a careful response, but also expressing great frustration and concern that the violence against blacks may one day lead to reprisals.&lt;ref name=sing&gt;Wouldn't Sing America," ''The Evening World'' (New York, New York) March 28, 1892, page 3, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6654115/wouldnt_sing_america_the_evening/, Not Their Country, ''The Decatur Herald'' (Decatur, Illinois) March 29, 1892, page 1, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6657652/not_their_country_the_decatur_herald/&lt;/ref&gt;

The event inspired Wells, who began to research and speak out against lynchings. In 1893, Wells sued the ''[[The Commercial Appeal|Memphis Commercial]]'' for libel when the journal attacked Wells over her reports on the racism and injustice of lynching. It had been claimed that lynching, while not legal, was a natural result of the need for revenge of a community against perpetrators of violent crime and did not single out blacks. Wells' work showed the falseness of this narrative. Wells asked lawyer and activist [[Albion W. Tourgee]] to represent her on the case, but Tourgee refused, having largely retired from law (with the exception of his ongoing support of the case which would become [[Plessy v Fergusson]]). Tourgee recommended Wells contact Barnett, and Barnett agreed to take the case. This may have been Barnett's introduction to Wells, whom he would marry two years later, and Barnett was taken with Wells. However, Barnett came to agree with the advice of Tourgee that the case could not be won, as a black woman would never win such a case heard by a white, male jury, and the case was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Karcher, Carolyn L. ''A Refugee from His Race: Albion W. Tourgée and His Fight Against White Supremacy''. UNC Press Books, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World's Fair ===
In 1893, Barnett coauthored a pamphlet entitled "The Reason Why the Colored American is not in the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] – The Afro-American's Contribution to Columbian Literature". The exposition, held in Chicago, refused to include an African American exhibit. The pamphlet was another early example of Barnett's personal and professional relationship with Wells.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; The pamphlet was published by Barnett, Wells, abolitionist [[Frederick Douglass]], and educator [[Irvine Garland Penn]]. The exhibition included a number of exhibits put on by individuals and approved by white organizers of the fair, including exhibits by the sculptor [[Edmonia Lewis]], a painting exhibit by scientist [[George Washington Carver]], and a statistical exhibit by [[John Imogen Howard]]. It also included blacks in white exhibits, such as [[Nancy Green]]'s portrayal of the character, "Aunt Jemima" for the R. T. Davis Milling Company.&lt;ref&gt;See introduction of 2013 edition of Rydell, Robert W. ''All the world's a fair: Visions of empire at American international expositions, 1876–1916''. University of Chicago Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriages and family ==
[[File:Ida Wells-Ferdinand Barnett and family.png|thumb|Photo of the Wells-Barnett Family from 1917&lt;ref name="hometies"/&gt;]]
Barnett's first wife was Molly Henrietta Graham Barnett, who was the first black woman to graduate from the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Bay2009"&gt;Bay, Mia. ''To Tell the Truth Freely: The Life of Ida B. Wells''. Macmillan, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Molly and Ferdinand had two children, Ferdinand L. and Albert Graham Barnett. Molly died in 1888&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; of heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;Bradwell, James B, "The Colored Bar of Chicago," ''Chicago Legal News'' (Chicago, Illinois), Vol XXIX, No. 10, October 31, 1896&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Ferdinand Barnett served as [[370th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Eighth Regiment]] supply sergeant in World War I.&lt;ref name="hometies"&gt;"Breaking Home Ties", ''The Broad Ax'' (Salt Lake City, Utah) December 22, 1917, p. 14, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653602/breaking_home_ties_the_broad_ax_salt/&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Barnett became the city editor of the ''Defender'' in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[No Headline], ''The Pittsburgh Courier'' (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), December 3, 1932, page 17, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653821/no_headline_the_pittsburgh_courier/&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells remained in Chicago after the [[Columbian Exposition]]. In June 1895, she and Barnett married. The couple had four children, Charles Aked (1896), Herman Kohlsaat (1897), Ida B. (1901) and Alfreda M. Barnett (1904). Charles was named for the English anti-lynching activist, [[Charles Aked]], and Herman was named for the owner of the ''Chicago Inter Ocean'', [[H. H. Kohlsaat|Herman Kohlsaat]], who supported the ''Conservator''.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; Barnett's attraction to Wells included his recognition of the mutual support for each other's careers that the relationship would bring. Shortly before their marriage, Wells purchased Barnett's stake in the ''Conservator'' and became the paper's manager and co-editor, while Barnett focused on his legal career.&lt;ref name="Bay2009"/&gt; Reverend [[Richard DeBaptiste]], founder of Olivet Baptist Church, was co-editor after Barnett.&lt;ref&gt;Dolinar, Brian, ed. ''The Negro in Illinois: The WPA Papers''. University of Illinois Press, 2013. p113&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later career ==
[[File:20070601 Wells House (2).JPG|thumb|left|From 1919–1930, Barnett and Wells lived in the [[Ida B. Wells-Barnett House]], now a [[List of Chicago Landmarks|Chicago landmark]] and [[National Historic Landmark]]]]
Barnett was an active Republican, and his support for the party put him in line for public office. In 1896, he was put in charge of the bureau of information and education for blacks by the [[Republican National Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;"Allison Says Iowa is Safe", ''The New York Times'' (New York, New York) August 18, 1896, page 3, accessed September, 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645724/allison_says_iowa_is_safe_the_new_york/&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1896, Barnett became the first black assistant state's attorney in Illinois, appointed by the state's attorney [[Charles S. Deneen]] upon the recommendation of the Cook County Commissioner [[Edward H. Wright]].&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; As assistant state's attorney, Barnett worked in the juvenile court, in antitrust cases, and in [[habeas corpus]] and extradition proceedings. He frequently appeared before the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] and had a good record.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; In 1902, Barnett made national news when he suggested that 10 million blacks would revolt against lynch law in the South at a gathering at Bethlehem Church in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;"Colored Race's Rights", ''Deseret Evening News'' (Salt Lake City, Utah) May 23, 1902, page 3, accessed September 15, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6645931/colored_races_rights_deseret_evening/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 he was appointed as head of the Chicago branch of the Republican Party's Negro Bureau. This appointment was opposed by [[Booker T. Washington]], who preferred Barnett's former partner, S. Laing Williams.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt;

=== Municipal court judgeship controversy ===
In 1906, Barnett was nominated as judge in the new municipal court in Chicago, the first black candidate for a judgeship in Illinois. Barnett lost the election by 304 votes due to a lack of support by white&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; and black Republicans. In the campaign for the position, Barnett did not gain the full support of black ministers, particularly [[Archibald J. Cary]]. They were angry that his wife Ida B. Wells supported gambling kingpin Bob Motts's Peking Theater – which was converted from a saloon. Barnett was initially declared winner, but the results were reviewed and Barnett became the only one of 27 Republican candidates rejected.&lt;ref name="Reed2014"&gt;Reed, Christopher Robert. ''Knock at the Door of Opportunity: Black Migration to Chicago, 1900–1919''. SIU Press, 2014. p191, 289&lt;/ref&gt; If he had been elected, Barnett would have been the second black judge in a court of record after [[Robert Heberton Terrell]] of Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="judgeship"/&gt;

=== Return to private practice and death ===
[[File:FL Barnett 1918.png|thumb|Photo of Barnett from ''The Broad Ax'' in 1918&lt;ref name="chickenjoe"&gt;Chicken Joe Campbell will not Hand for Governor Frank O Lowden has Commuted his Death Sentence to Life Imprisonment, ''The Broad Ax'' (Salt Lake City, Utah) April 13, 1918, page 3, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653572//&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Barnett left the position of assistant state's attorney in 1910, turning to private practice where he advocated for African-American rights. He often worked ''pro bono'', focusing on employment discrimination and criminal cases.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt; In 1917 he was a candidate for [[Chicago City Council|alderman]] of the second ward in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Barnett, "Candidate for Alderman", ''The Broad Ax'' (Salt Lake City, Utah) February 24, 1917, page 4, accessed September 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6653894//&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous case was the defense with attorneys [[Robert M. McMurdy]] and Cowen of "Chicken Joe" Campbell. Although Campbell was convicted for the murder of Odelle B. Allen, his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by Governor [[Frank O. Lowden]] on April 12, 1918.&lt;ref name="chickenjoe"/&gt;

in the 1920s, Barnett and his wife supported [[Marcus Garvey]] and the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]].&lt;ref name="Reed2014"/&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, Barnett began to support the Democratic Party.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt;

Barnett died March 11, 1936.&lt;ref name="Finkelman2009"/&gt;

== Anglican churches ==
There are two Anglican churches is Northern Cyprus.  They are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standrewschurchkyrenia.net/&lt;/ref&gt;
* St Andrew's Church in [[Kyrenia]]
* St Mark's Church in [[Famagusta]] visit:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stmarksfamagusta.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthodox Christianity ==
In 2010, the US Department of State reported that "Greek Cypriot Orthodox and Maronite Catholics were allowed to perform religious services on a regular basis, without prior permission."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148926.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2010 - Cyprus], US Department of State, Retrieved 2011-04-27&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2010, Resolution 1631, was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... calling for the protection of religious sites and artifacts from and in Turkish-occupied areas of northern Cyprus as well as for general respect for religious freedom."&lt;ref name=aw&gt;[http://www.armenianweekly.com/2010/10/07/turkey%E2%80%99s-foreign-ministry-decries-%E2%80%98biased-resolution%E2%80%99-on-n-cyprus/ Turkey’s Foreign Ministry Decries ‘Biased Resolution’ on N. Cyprus by Nanore Barsoumian] Armenian Weekly, 7 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Turkish Foreign Ministry responded with a press released statement, saying that the resolution had "many factual errors which may harm the credibility of the House of Representatives".&lt;ref name=aw/&gt;

On 27 January 2011, the Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]], in written declaration no. 467, condemned the alleged interruption of the Christmas mass in Northern Cyprus by Turkish troops and restrictions to the right to freedom of religion and worship.&lt;ref name="coe467"&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc11/EDOC12505.pdf Interruption of the Christmas mass in the northern occupied part of Cyprus by Turkish troops and restrictions to the right to freedom of religion and worship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225181325/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc11/EDOC12505.pdf |date=2011-02-25 }} Written Declaration No. 467, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Doc. 12505, 27 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The declaration claimed that Turkish troops forced the priest conducting the service to remove his vestments and ordered everybody to leave the church, thus violating the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="coe467" /&gt;

On 18 March 2011, 204 Greek school books, including religious books, that were being taken to the schools at Rizokarpaso were confiscated by Turkish Cypriot customs officers at the Pergamos village barricade. The Turkish Cypriot daily newspaper ''Afrika'', in a front page article, criticised those who claim that there is freedom of religion in Northern Cyprus when the religious books were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrikagazetesi.net/arsivafrika/Mart2011/18mart2011.pdf Islam fanatizmi Isa'ya yasak, Turkish translation: "Islam fanaticism, ban Jesus"], Afrika newspaper, 18 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church service restriction controversy===
On 20 May 2016, Northern Cypriot Foreign Minister [[Tahsin Ertuğruloğlu]] restricted Greek Orthodox communities to only hold a single religious service per year, with the exceptions of the [[Apostolos Andreas Monastery]] in Rizokarpaso, the [[Monastery of St. Barnabas]] in Famagusta and [[Morphou#Church|St. Mamas' Church]] in Morphou. The remaining churches could be used for one of the following three feasts: the church's [[Name days in Greece|Name Day]], [[Easter]] or [[Christmas]].&lt;ref name=CyMail&gt;{{cite news |author=Andria Kades |title=Turkish Cypriot side restricts Orthodox church services in north |newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]] |url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/05/24/turkish-cypriot-side-restricts-orthodox-church-services-north/ |date=24 May 2016 |accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undersecretary Mustafa Lakadamyalı claimed that the move was to prevent the "abuse" of the permission to hold masses, also citing difficulties with the policing of more than one mass a day or frequent masses. Lakadamyalı also said that "whilst some TRNC citizens can pass to the south even for worship, some absolutely cannot". No restriction was placed on Maronites.&lt;ref name=Kibris&gt;{{cite web |title=KKTC'deki kilse ayinlerine sınırlama |publisher=[[Kıbrıs (newspaper)|Kıbrıs]] |url=http://www.kibrisgazetesi.com/?p=797018 |date=20 May 2016 |accessdate=23 May 2016 |language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision was harshly criticized by Turkish Cypriot group [[Famagusta Initiative]] as "chauvinist and intolerant" and it was pointed out that no problem was encountered in the masses which took place in, for example, the [[Nestorian Church (Famagusta)|Nestorian Church]] in Famagusta.&lt;ref name=Kibris /&gt; Ertuğruloğlu's decision was also criticized by Burak Mavis of the [[Turkish Cypriot Teachers’ Trade Union]] (KTOS) who called out the whole debate as being driven by "a backwards and racist political mentality," but it was defended by [[Yilmaz Bora]], the leader of the Association of the Ex-Servicemen of the [[Turkish Resistance Organisation]], who was cited as saying "it was not possible to live with the Greek Cypriots in a United Cyprus, because the mentality of the Greek Cypriots has not changed in 53 years."&lt;ref name=CyMail /&gt;

In the 1760s [[William Blackstone]] described the '''Fundamental Laws of England''' in ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]], Book the First – Chapter the First : Of the Absolute Rights of Individuals''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk1ch1.htm The Avalon Project : Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329045450/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk1ch1.htm |date=2013-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as "the absolute [[Rights of Englishmen|rights of every Englishman]]" and traced their basis and evolution as follows:
*[[Magna Carta]] between [[John, King of England|King John]] and his barons in 1215
*confirmation of Magna Carta by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in 1216, 1217, and 1225
*''Confirmatio Cartarum'' ([[Confirmation of Charters]]) 1253
*a multitude of subsequent corroborating statutes, from [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] to [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]]
*the [[Petition of Right]], a parliamentary declaration in 1628 of the liberties of the people, assented to by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]
*more concessions made by King Charles I to his Parliament
*many laws, particularly the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]], passed under [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]
*the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] assented to by [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]]
*the [[Act of Settlement 1701]]

Blackstone's list was an 18th-century constitutional view, and the [[Union of the Crowns]] had occurred in 1603 between [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland]], and the 1628 Petition of Right had already referred to the ''fundamental laws'' being violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/361/361-24.htm|title=1625-29: Charles I - the first crisis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=wisc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recorded usage==

The phrase ''Fundamental Laws of England'' has often been used by those opposing particular legislative, royal or religious initiatives.

For example, in 1641 the [[House of Commons of England]] protested that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was "... subverting the fundamental laws of England and Ireland....",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://personal.pitnet.net/primarysources/protests.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2004-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407010049/http://personal.pitnet.net/primarysources/protests.html |archive-date=2004-04-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; part of a campaign ending in 1649 with the [[beheading]] of King Charles I.

Subsequently, the phrase was used by the [[Leveller]] Lieut. Col. [[John Lilburne]] (later to become a [[Quaker]]) accusing the [[House of Lords]] and House of Commons of tyranny in ''The Just Defence of John Lilburne, Against Such as charge him with Turbulency of Spirit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.strecorsoc.org/docs/defence2.html|title=The Just Defence of John Lilburne (Part 2)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031219101110/http://www.strecorsoc.org/docs/defence2.html|archive-date=2003-12-19|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilburne also wrote a 1646 book called ''The Legal Fundamental Liberties of the People of England, asserted, revived and vindicated''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.strecorsoc.org/docs/vindicated2.html|title=The Levellers (False so called) Vindicated|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040102172147/http://www.strecorsoc.org/docs/vindicated2.html|archive-date=2004-01-02|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1646, the [[General Court of Massachusetts]] referred to the Fundamental Laws of England in regard to the Magna Carta, while defending their representative and legislative autonomy in their address to the [[Long Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/sourcesconstitut00stev|title=Sources of the Constitution of the United States, considered in relation to colonial and English history|first=C. Ellis (Charles Ellis)|last=Stevens|date=3 August 1894|publisher=New York : Macmillan and co.|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1670 trial, [[William Penn]] called upon the phrase many times, including "... However, this I leave upon your Consciences, who are of the Jury (and my sole Judges) that if these Ancient Fundamental Laws, which relate to Liberty and Property, and (are not limited to particular Persuasions in Matters of Religion) must not be indispensably maintained and observed, Who can say he hath Right to the Coat upon his Back? ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/globalrights/religion/penn-trial.html |title=The Tryal of Wm.

In the 1774 pamphlet [[American Claim of Rights]], South Carolina's [[William Henry Drayton|Chief Justice William Drayton]] wrote 
&lt;blockquote&gt;That the Americans being descended from the same ancestors with the people of England, and owing fealty to the same [[The Crown|Crown]], are therefore equally with them, entitled to the common law of England formed by their common ancestors; and to all and singular the benefits, rights, liberties and claims specified in Magna Charta, in the petition of Rights, in the Bill of Rights, and in the Act of Settlement. They being no more than principally declaratory of the grounds of the fundamental laws of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.schistory.org/displays/RevWar/archives-online/Gibbes__v__1__p__011b.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2004-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040312142152/http://www.schistory.org/displays/RevWar/archives-online/Gibbes__v__1__p__011b.html |archive-date=2004-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other famous subscribers to the phrase include [[Edward Coke|Lord Coke]] (1522&amp;ndash;1634), [[Emerich de Vattel]] (1714&amp;ndash;1767), and [[Samuel Adams]] (1722&amp;ndash;1803).

==Unwritten history==

[[John Locke|Locke]]'s view in ''... Civil Government'' 1690 was "..., that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty or possessions; ...". This philosophy was in keeping with the view that the Fundamental Laws predated the Magna Carta in both [[custom (law)|custom]] and [[natural law]]. Influenced by Locke, the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence]] stated: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

For those who believed that the Fundamental Laws of England predated the Magna Carta, there was debate about whether they arose from [[time immemorial]], were somehow immanent to society, from post-[[Roman law|Roman]] [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] times, or from various combinations of these and other origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanderbilt.edu/rpw_center/pdfs/PARKER.PDF|title=Constructing a Juridical Memory: The Antiquarian Response to the Union of Kingdoms|last=Parker|first=Brett|date=2002-08-04|website=vanderbilt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century and later==

In ''[[MacCormick v. Lord Advocate]]'' (1953), an action over the legitimacy of the numeric [[Style of the British Sovereign]], asserting only the style [[List of titles and honours of Elizabeth II#Royal titles and styles|Elizabeth I for Elizabeth II]] would only carry legal authority in Scotland [[Lord President Cooper]] gave judicial recognition to the concept of a "fundamental law" of Scotland that merged with that of England into the law of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the time of the [[Act of Union 1707]], a corpus of law which the supremacy of Parliament may not extend to altering as “the principle of unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle and has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law”. He raised as a hypothetical consideration the question of whether such fundamental laws could be judged by an English or Scottish [[court]] in the same manner as other countries consider constitutional cases. However, he left the matter open, saying "I reserve my opinion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawscot.org.uk/whatis/case8.html Transcript]from Law Scot website {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040421023411/http://www.lawscot.org.uk/whatis/case8.html |date=2004-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of [[parliamentary supremacy]] was upheld in the highest court by [[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]] in 1969:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is often said that it would be unconstitutional for the United Kingdom Parliament to do certain things, meaning that the moral, political and other reasons against doing them are so strong that most people would regard it as highly improper if Parliament did these things. But that does not mean that it is beyond the power of Parliament to do such things. If Parliament chose to do any of them the courts would not hold the Act of Parliament invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Madzimbamuto v. Lardner-Burke|vol=1|reporter=AC|opinion=645|pinpoint=723|court=UKPC|date=1969|url=http://iclr.co.uk/document/1961002667/casereport_71129/html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under this precedent, Parliament has the legal authority to do anything, even though its Acts might contradict common-law [[principles of natural justice]]. The classic rebuttal or at least qualification is expressed by [[Albert Venn Dicey]], whose 1885 text ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'' argues that the [[democratic legitimacy|will of the electorate]] must ultimately prevail over any attempt at tyranny: it is "a political, not a legal fact" that fundamental principles of natural justice cannot be denied. This implies that in most scenarios principles of the Fundamental Laws can be upheld by [[statutory interpretation]] or as an alternative since 1998 by issuing a [[Declaration of incompatibility]].

Laws LJ in ''[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]]'' [2002] EWHC 195 (Admin) at [62] recognised what he called "constitutional statutes":

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the present state of its maturity the common law has come to recognise that there exist rights which should properly be classified as constitutional or fundamental: see for example such cases as Simms [2000] 2 AC 115 per Lord Hoffmann at 131, Pierson v Secretary of State [1998] AC 539, [R v] Leech [1994] QB 198, Derbyshire County Council v Times Newspapers Ltd. [1993] AC 534, and [R v] Witham [1998] QB 575. And from this a further insight follows. We should recognise a hierarchy of Acts of Parliament as it were: "ordinary" statutes and "constitutional" statutes. The two categories must be distinguished on a principled basis. In my opinion a constitutional statute is one which (a) conditions the legal relationship between citizen and State in some general, overarching manner, or (b) enlarges or diminishes the scope of what we would now regard as fundamental constitutional rights. (a) and (b) are of necessity closely related: it is difficult to think of an instance of (a) that is not also an instance of (b). The special status of constitutional statutes follows the special status of constitutional rights. Examples are the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights 1689, the Act of Union, the Reform Acts which distributed and enlarged the franchise, the HRA, the Scotland Act 1998 and the Government of Wales Act 1998. The [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|ECA]] clearly belongs in this family. It incorporated the whole corpus of substantive Community rights and obligations, and gave overriding domestic effect to the judicial and administrative machinery of Community law. It may be there has never been a statute having such profound effects on so many dimensions of our daily lives. The ECA is, by force of the common law, a constitutional statute. (cf [[obiter dictum|obiter]] remarks by the House of Lords in ''Watkins v Home Office'' [2006] UKHL 17 at [62])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2004 the [[Joint Committee]] (of the House of Commons and House of Lords) overseeing the drafting of the Civil Contingencies Bill published its first report in which, among other things, suggested:
*Amending the proposed clauses, operative in a State of Emergency, that would grant [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|the Cabinet]], by Emergency Regulations, the power "to disapply or modify any [[Act of Parliament]]" on the grounds that such a clause is overly wide.
*An amendment to preclude changes to the following Acts, which, it suggested, formed "the fundamental parts of constitutional law" of the United Kingdom:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200203/jtselect/jtdcc/184/18407.htm#a44|title=Joint Committee on Draft Civil Contingencies Bill - First Report|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Lords/Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The amendment was defeated and the bill passed without it, although the government did partially implement one recommendation—the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] may not be amended by emergency regulations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13633">'''Gifts in kind''', also referred to as ''in-kind donations'', is a kind of [[alms|charitable giving]] in which, instead of giving money to buy needed goods and services, the goods and services themselves are given. Gifts in kind are distinguished from gifts of [[cash]] or [[stock]].  Some types of gifts in kind are appropriate, others are not.&lt;ref&gt;Moustaffa Osman, [http://odihpn.org/magazine/in-kind-donations-who-benefits "In-kind donations: Who benefits?"], ''Humanitarian Practice Network'', Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of in-kind gifts include goods like food, clothing, medicines, furniture, office equipment, and building materials. Performance of services, such as building an orphanage, providing office space or offering administrative support, may also be counted as in-kind gifts. 

While many attest to the benefits of in-kind over cash gifts, others have argued for their disadvantages, particularly in the context of [[Emergency management|disaster relief]].&lt;ref name="million-shirts-aid-worker-responses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodintents.org/aid-debates/1-million-shirts-campaign|title = 1 million shirts campaign|publisher = Good Intentions are not enough|date = 2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="in-kind-donation-chceklist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodintents.org/core-posts/donating-goods-overseas|title = 6 questions you should ask before donating goods overseas|publisher = Good Intentions are not enough|date = 2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor of gifts in kind==
{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2013}}
===Reduce in waste of materials===

Many donated goods are either [[used goods|second hand]] or otherwise surplus. If not donated to people who need them, they might otherwise end up in a [[landfill]]. Thus, it is argued that gifts in kind reduce resource use and pollution. This provides a means, particularly for corporations, of doing social good with things that would otherwise be a liability.

===Use in disaster relief===

During disasters and other humanitarian crises, companies and individuals often want to help with the [[disaster relief]] operations. Some people have argued that giving goods that are already at hand is more cost effective for the donor than giving money to buy these same goods, thus reducing the cost of buying the goods afresh, particularly in the face of shortages.

===Long-term development aid===

Helping with longer term development in impoverished or otherwise distressed areas is a high priority for governments and large [[NGO]]s. It is argued that gifts in kind can be a significant component of a larger humanitarian development strategy.

===Lower susceptibility to corruption===

It has been argued that donated goods are much less susceptible to becoming [[political corruption|graft]] because physical goods are more tangible than money. 

However, the argument may be reversed in the modern context, now that there exist [[mobile phone]]-based payment mechanisms such as [[m-Pesa]] that have been used successfully for [[cash transfer]] programs, making cash transfers less dependent on intermediaries than the shipping of physical goods.

===Great impact for small cost===

Gifts in kind supply a market efficiency which is difficult to attain by other means.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pj.news.chass.ncsu.edu/2012/08/03/benefit-corporate-kind-donations "The Benefit of Corporate In-Kind Donations"], ''Philanthropy Journal'', 2012-08-03&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many charities that provide life-saving medications to people in impoverished nations could not afford to buy these drugs using their cash donations or grants alone. Donated drugs help these organizations to work most effectively at a much lower cost.

===Access to goods which are not readily available===

Some products are simply not available, but are desperately needed nonetheless. An example is anti-malarial drugs. These drugs are unavailable in many areas of the world where they are most needed, and if they are available, the people who need them are not in a position to purchase them. They are not manufactured locally and the costs of setting up local manufacturing facilities would be prohibitive, given the regulations surrounding pharmaceuticals.  There is a high likelihood of locally available drugs being counterfeit, with often fatal consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/the-fatal-consequences-of-counterfeit-drugs-139422027 "The Fatal Consequences of Counterfeit Drugs"], ''Smithsonian magazine'', Oct 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate social responsibility===
As more and more companies continue to acknowledge their [[corporate social responsibility]], they are also recognizing the benefits of participating in gifts in kind programs.&lt;ref&gt;'In Kind Gifts'  [http://grantspace.org/Tools/Knowledge-Base/Funding-Resources/Corporations/In-kind-gifts Foundation Center]&lt;/ref&gt; In '' The Business Case for Product Philanthropy, '' a 63-page report published by the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs, authors Justin M. Ross and Kellie L. McGiverin-Bohan argue that businesses can do well by doing good through product philanthropy, as well as explore the advantages of donating goods over the liquidation and/or destruction of goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, with cash donations on the decrease over the past several years, offering donations of goods and services is a way for corporations to continue pursuing their philanthropic goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philanthropy.com/article/Cash-Giving-Is-Flat-at/140257/.html "With Cash Giving Flat, Big Companies Offer Other Aid"], ''The Chronicle of Philanthropy'', 2013-07-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against gifts in kind==

===Matching of donation to recipient needs===

One of the chief criticisms of gifts in kind, particularly in the context of [[disaster relief]] but also in other contexts, is that the things that people are likely to gift may be poorly matched to the immediate needs of recipients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.copori.eu/1369.php | title= In-kind contribution - definitions and handling for scientific cases | publisher= Communication and Policy development for Research Infrastructures | accessdate= 29 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but rather be influenced by what donors happen to want to dispose of. Some of the possibilities are:&lt;ref name=in-kind-donation-chceklist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelkeizer.com/humourless/2010/the-unkindest-cut-why-gifts-in-kind-are-often-a-bad-idea/|title = The unkindest cut: why gifts in kind are often a bad idea|last = Keizer|first = Michael|date = 2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The donated items may not be needed by the recipients at all.
* The donated items may be needed by the recipients but are available locally and the cost of shipping the items from a remote location is far more than the cost of obtaining them locally. In the context of [[disaster relief]], a large influx of donated goods may clog the [[port]]s making it difficult for needed emergency supplies to reach their recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aidwatchers.com/2010/01/nobody-wants-your-old-shoes-how-not-to-help-in-haiti/|title = Nobody wants your old shoes: How not to help in Haiti|last = Shaikh|first = Alanna|publisher = Aid Watch|date= 2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://talesfromethehood.com/2010/01/29/what-is-it-with-the-shoes/ |title=What IS it with the shoes? |publisher=Tales from the Hood |date=2010-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827042802/http://talesfromethehood.com/2010/01/29/what-is-it-with-the-shoes/ |archivedate=2012-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The donated items may be needed somewhat by the recipients, but it may be more beneficial if the items were sold to the highest payer and the money thus collected be used to meet other needs of the intended recipients.&lt;ref name=givewell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2010/04/30/who-needs-in-kind-donations-more-the-recipients-or-the-givers/|title = Who needs in-kind donations more: the recipients or the givers?|publisher = [[GiveWell]]|date = 2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aidthoughts.org/?p=1254|publisher = Aid Thoughts|title = The unkindness of in-kind aid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empowerment of recipients===

In addition to the argument that gifts in kind often do not meet the needs of recipients, it has also been argued that gifts in kind fail to empower the recipients because the recipients don't have as much flexibility on how to spend the gifts as they would with gifts of cash or of public goods that they actively solicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desireeadaway.com/you-have-to-know-me-before-you-can-help-me/|title = You have to know me before you can help me|date = 2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, it has been argued that sending gifts in kind without checking on what the recipients may actually need may be disrespectful to the recipients, and in some cases self-centered and narcissistic, being focused on the needs of the donor rather than the recipient.&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloodandmilk.org/2010/04/28/say-no-to-old-clothes/|title = Say No to Old Clothers|publisher = Blood and Milk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on local economies===

Some critics of gifts in kind argue that, like [[dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]], these have an artificial adverse impact on local industries producing similar goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviewfromthecave.com/2010/04/cash-not-gifts-please.html|title = Cash, not gifts please}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/19/how_not_to_help_haiti|title = How Not to Help Haiti|publisher = ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to criticism==

===Improved communication between recipients and donors===

Some of the downsides of gifts in kind may be mitigated by allowing recipients to communicate their needs to donors, thus helping donors and recipients match up. This has been made possible with the advent of the [[Internet]] as it is now possible to create an [[online marketplace]] for in-kind donations. [[Gifts in Kind International]] operates a network called Good360 that aims to do exactly this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about.good360.org/AboutUs/Good360_FAQs |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706104348/http://about.good360.org/AboutUs/Good360_FAQs |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-06 |title=Good360 FAQ |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Occupy Sandy]] volunteers use a sort of [[gift registry]] for this purpose; families and businesses impacted by the storm make specific requests, which remote donors can purchase directly via a web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interoccupy.net/occupysandy/registries/|title=Occupy Sandy Registries|accessdate=2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of online giving marketplaces, including [[GlobalGiving]] and [[DonorsChoose]], however, are focused on cash donations, though the nonprofits seeking these donations usually specify what types of things they intend to buy with a given donation quantity.

===Standards for gifts in kind===

Global Hand has published a series of standards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalhand.org/en/browse/guidelines/all/document/6558|title = Standards}}&lt;/ref&gt; for gifts in kind. The principles include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalhand.org/en/browse/guidelines/all/document/21008|title = Global Hand Principles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Need driven: Driven by a genuine and thorough understanding of the needs of the recipients.
* Quality controlled: Goods are carefully chosen, of appropriate quality, and in consultation with the recipient.
* Determined by informed choices.
* Avoiding aid dependency.

and many more.

The Tales from the Hood blog has argued that there are two preconditions for successful gifts in kind.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talesfromethehood.com/2010/04/22/gifts-in-kind/ |publisher=Tales from the Hood |title=Gifts-in-Kind |date=2010-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609031257/http://talesfromethehood.com/2010/04/22/gifts-in-kind/ |archivedate=2012-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Gifts in kind should not drive the design of the charity program or aid program. Rather, the program should be evaluated based on the evidence and the appropriate gifts should be determined based on that evidence.
* Gifts in kind should not be used to substitute for other needed items if they do not fit the requirements well.

== Charity stores ==

Unlike a disaster relief scenario, the needs of a [[charity shop]] are long-term and more flexible; any item that can be sold at a price higher than the cost of warehousing it could be worthwhile.  Large non-profits, such as [[Goodwill Industries]], are also able to make use of items that cannot be sold in their thrift stores, for example by bundling them and selling them as bulk material or scrap.  These stores refuse donations that cost money to dispose of safely if unwanted, such as [[e-waste]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7575">In [[optics]], '''group velocity dispersion''' (GVD) is a characteristic of a [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersive medium]], used most often to determine how the medium will affect the duration of an optical pulse traveling through it. Formally, GVD is defined as the derivative of the inverse of [[group velocity]] of light in a material with respect to [[angular frequency]],&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial \omega} \left( \frac{1}{v_g(\omega)} \right)_{\omega=\omega_0},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; are angular frequencies, and the group velocity &lt;math&gt;v_g(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;v_g(\omega) \equiv \partial \omega / \partial k&lt;/math&gt;. The units of group velocity dispersion are [time]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/[distance], often expressed in fs&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/mm.

Equivalently, group velocity dispersion can be defined in terms of the medium-dependent wave vector &lt;math&gt;k(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; according to
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \equiv \left( \frac{\partial^2 k}{\partial \omega^2}\right)_{\omega=\omega_0},&lt;/math&gt;
or in terms of the [[refractive index]] &lt;math&gt;n(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; according to
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \equiv \frac{2}{c} \left(\frac{\partial n}{\partial \omega}\right)_{\omega=\omega_0} + \frac{\omega_0}{c}\left( \frac{\partial^2 n}{\partial \omega^2}\right)_{\omega=\omega_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

Group velocity dispersion is most commonly used to estimate the amount of [[chirp]] that will be imposed on a pulse of light after passing through a material of interest. The relevant expression is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{chirp} = (\textrm{material} \,\, \textrm{thickness}) \, \times \, \textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \, \times \, (\textrm{bandwidth}).&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation===

A simple illustration of how GVD can be used to determine pulse chirp can be seen by looking at the effect of a [[Bandwidth-limited pulse|transform-limited]]  pulse of duration &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; passing through a planar medium of thickness ''d''. Before passing through the medium, the phase offsets of all frequencies are aligned in time, and the pulse can be described as a function of time according to the expression
:&lt;math&gt;E(t) = Ae^{-\frac{t^2}{4 \sigma^2}}e^{-i \omega_0 t},&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently, as a function of frequency according to the expression
:&lt;math&gt;E(\omega) = Be^{-\frac{(w-w_0)^2}{4 (1/2\sigma)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
(the parameters ''A'' and ''B'' are normalization constants).
Passing through the medium results in a frequency-dependent phase accumulation &lt;math&gt;\Delta \phi(\omega) = k(\omega) d&lt;/math&gt; , such that the post-medium pulse can be described by 
:&lt;math&gt;E(\omega) = Be^{-\frac{(w-w_0)^2}{4 (1/2\sigma)^2}}e^{i k(\omega) d}.&lt;/math&gt;
In general, the refractive index &lt;math&gt;n(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore the wave vector &lt;math&gt;k(\omega) = n(\omega)\omega/c&lt;/math&gt;, can be an arbitrary function of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, making it difficult to analytically perform the inverse Fourier transform back into the time domain. However, if the bandwidth of the pulse is narrow relative to the curvature of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then good approximations of the impact of the refractive index can be obtained by replacing &lt;math&gt;k(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; with its [[Taylor Series|Taylor expansion]] centered about &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n(\omega)\omega}{c} = \underbrace{\frac{n(\omega_0)\omega_0}{c}}_{k(\omega_0)} \quad+\quad \underbrace{\left[ \frac{n(\omega_0)+n'(\omega_0)\omega_0}{c}\right]}_{k'(\omega_0)}(\omega-\omega_0) \quad+\quad\frac{1}{2}\underbrace{\left[ \frac{2 n'(\omega_0) + n''(\omega_0)\omega_0}{c} \right]}_{\textrm{GVD}} (\omega-\omega_0)^2 \quad+\quad ...&lt;/math&gt;

Truncating this expression and inserting it into the post-medium frequency-domain expression results in a post-medium time-domain expression of 
:&lt;math&gt;E_{post}(t) = A_{post}\exp\left[-\frac{(t - k'(\omega_0) d)^2}{4 (\sigma^2-i \, \textrm{GVD} \, d/2)}\right] e^{i[k(\omega_0) d - \omega_0 t]}&lt;/math&gt;.
On balance, the pulse will have lengthened to an intensity [[standard deviation]] value of
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{post} = \sqrt{ \sigma^2 + \left[ d \, \times \, \textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \, \times \, \left(\frac{1}{2\sigma}\right)\right]^2  }&lt;/math&gt;
thus validating the initial expression. Note that for a [[Bandwidth-limited pulse|transform-limited]] pulse σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2, which makes it appropriate to identify 1/(2σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) as the bandwidth.

===Alternate derivation===

An alternate derivation of the relationship between pulse chirp and GVD, which more immediately illustrates the reason why GVD can be defined by the derivative of inverse group velocity, can be outlined as follows. Consider two transform-limited pulses of carrier frequencies &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_2&lt;/math&gt;, which are initially overlapping in time. After passing through the medium, these two pulses will exhibit a time delay between their respective pulse-envelope centers, given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T = d \left( \frac{1}{v_g(\omega_2)} - \frac{1}{v_g(\omega_1)} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
The expression can be approximated as a [[Taylor Series|Taylor expansion]], giving 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T = d \left( \frac{1}{v_g(\omega_1)} + \frac{\partial}{\partial \omega}\left( \frac{1}{v_g(\omega')}\right)_{\omega' = \omega_1}(\omega_2-\omega_1) - \frac{1}{v_g(\omega_1)} \right), &lt;/math&gt;
or,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T = d \, \times \, \textrm{GVD}(\omega_1) \, \times \, (\omega_2-\omega_1).&lt;/math&gt;
From here it is possible to imagine scaling this expression up two pulses to infinitely many. The frequency difference &lt;math&gt;\omega_2-\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; must be replaced by the bandwidth, and the time delay &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; evolves into the induced chirp.

==Group delay dispersion==

A closely related yet independent quantity is the '''group delay dispersion''' ('''GDD'''), defined such that group velocity dispersion is the group delay dispersion per unit length. GDD is commonly used as a parameter in characterizing layered mirrors, where the group velocity dispersion is not particularly-well defined, yet the chirp induced after bouncing off the mirror can be well-characterized. The units of group delay dispersion are [time]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, often expressed in fs&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The group delay dispersion (GDD) of an optical element is the derivative of the [[group delay]] with respect to [[angular frequency]], and also the second derivative of the optical phase. &lt;math&gt;D_2(\omega) = -\frac{\partial T_g}{d \omega} = \frac{d^2 \phi}{d\omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;. It is a measure of the [[chromatic dispersion]] of the element. GDD is related to the total dispersion parameter &lt;math&gt;D_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; as

&lt;math display="block"&gt; D_2(\omega) = -\frac{2\pi c}{\lambda^2}D_{tot}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Jonathan McIntosh''' is an American producer, writer, artist, and cultural critic. He is the creator of the Pop Culture Detective Agency video series examining intersections of politics, masculinity, and entertainment. He was also a producer and co-writer on the ''[[Tropes vs. Women in Video Games]]'' YouTube video series.

===Remix Work===
McIntosh produced [[video mashup]]s early in his film career. A proponent of [[remix culture]], he spoke on the topic and how media produced in this fashion can be uniquely powerful tools for commenting on political and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I+C+i #2 // The Remix as Cultural Ecosystem|url=http://www.cccb.org/en/activities/file/i-c-i-2-the-remix-as-cultural-ecosystem/217907|website=Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American academic and political activist [[Lawrence Lessig]] cites McIntosh's work as among his favorites in the book [[Remix (book)|Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy]] for its ability to deliver "a message more powerfully than any original alone could."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessig|first1=Lawrence|title=Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy|date=2008|publisher=Penguin Press|page=71|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7eRPKIvEo9gC&amp;pg=PT50&amp;dq=%22jonathan+mcintosh%22+remix#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jonathan%20mcintosh%22%20remix&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 July 2017|isbn=9781440634628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, McIntosh spoke before the [[United States Copyright Office]] to advocate for exemptions to the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]—a law designed to criminalize the unauthorized production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services regarding copyrighted works—that was adversely affecting video artists like himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kravets|first1=David|title=Feds Considering Allowing DVD-Encryption Cracking|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/05/dvd-encryption-hacking|accessdate=6 July 2017|publisher=Wired|date=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2009 video, ''Buffy versus Edward: Twilight Remixed''—a high-profile mashup video and [[Webby Award]] nominee for remixing—was used as an example in the copyright discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nye Griffiths|first1=Daniel|title=Copyright In The Twilight Zone: The Strange Case Of 'Buffy Versus Edward'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2013/01/15/copyright-in-the-twilight-zone-the-strange-case-of-buffy-versus-edward|accessdate=11 July 2017|publisher=Forbes|date=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act#Previous exemptions|final rulemaking]] stated an exemption for: "Motion pictures (including television shows and videos), as defined in 17 U.S.C. 101, where circumvention is undertaken solely in order to make use of short portions of the motion pictures for the purpose of criticism or comment in limited instances." It specifically points out ''Buffy versus Edward: Twilight Remixed'' in the rulemaking: &lt;blockquote&gt;Based on the video evidence presented, the Register is able to conclude that diminished quality likely would impair the criticism and comment contained in noncommercial videos.  For example, the Register is able to perceive that Buffy vs Edward and other noncommercial videos would suffer significantly because of blurring and the loss of detail in characters’ expression and sense of depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Section 1201 Rulemaking: Fifth Triennial Proceeding to Determine Exemptions to the Prohibition on Circumvention|date=2012|url=https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2012/Section_1201_Rulemaking_2012_Recommendation.pdf|website=Copyright.gov|publisher=United States Copyright Office|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Tropes vs. Women in Video Games===
From 2013-2015, McIntosh worked on the Tropes vs. Women in Video Games YouTube video series as a producer and co-writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jonathan McIntosh|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7366402/|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=September 2017}} The web series was a highly successful [[Kickstarter]] created by [[Anita Sarkeesian]] that examined gender tropes in video games.

===Pop Culture Detective Agency===
In 2016 McIntosh launched the Pop Culture Detective Agency, a [[Patreon]]-funded web series examining the intersections of politics, masculinity, and entertainment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rouner|first1=Jef|title=Feminist Frequency’s Jonathan McIntosh Has New Show About Masculinity|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/feminist-frequency-s-jonathan-mcintosh-has-new-show-about-masculinity-8568260|accessdate=12 September 2017|publisher=Houston Press|date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The long-form video essays examine a variety of topics within these themes. One episode explored the concept of [[toxic masculinity]] through an American pop culture lens. Other episodes are devoted to examining specific pieces of pop culture, such as television programs [[Steven Universe]] and [[The Big Bang Theory]], and films including [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]] and [[Star Wars]]. Some of the videos produced in the series propose new cultural tropes in which to understand the topics discussed, such as ''Born Sexy Yesterday'', which seeks to explain how fictional characters exhibit men’s fear of experienced women.

==Writing==
In 2014, McIntosh wrote the opinion piece, ''Playing with privilege: the invisible benefits of gaming while male'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McIntosh|first1=Jonathan|title=Playing with privilege: the invisible benefits of gaming while male|date=April 23, 2014|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/4/23/5640678/playing-with-privilege-the-invisible-benefits-of-gaming-while-male|website=Polygon|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mullis|first1=Steve|title=Gaming While Male: A 'Privilege' Few Men Recognize|date=April 27, 2014|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/04/27/306853264/gaming-while-male-a-privilege-few-men-recognize|website=NPR|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which addressed the [[Gamergate controversy]] that had been receiving increasing media attention and public discourse. In the piece, he sought to address the underlying problems that contributed toward [[sexism in video gaming]] by examining the inherent privileges that male-identified gamers benefit from.  Taking inspiration from the famous ''Daily Effects of White Privilege'' list by [[Peggy McIntosh]], among others, McIntosh listed 25 Daily Effects of Male Game Privilege. These included such privileges as "I will never be asked or expected to speak for all other gamers who share my gender."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29295">'''Judicial independence''' is the concept that the [[judiciary]] should be independent from the other [[Separation of powers|branches of government]]. That is, [[court]]s should not be subject to improper influence from the other branches of government or from private or partisan interests. Judicial independence is important to the idea of [[separation of powers]].

Different countries deal with the idea of judicial independence through different means of judicial selection, or choosing [[judge]]s. One way to promote judicial independence is by granting [[life tenure]] or long tenure for judges, which ideally frees them to decide [[Legal case|cases]] and make [[Court order|rulings]] according to the [[rule of law]] and [[judicial discretion]], even if those decisions are politically unpopular or opposed by powerful interests. This concept can be traced back to 18th-century England.

In some countries, the ability of the judiciary to check the legislature is enhanced by the power of [[judicial review]]. This power can be used, for example, by mandating certain action when the judiciary perceives that a branch of government is refusing to perform a constitutional duty or by declaring laws passed by the legislature unconstitutional.

==Theory of judicial independence==
[[File:Hamilton small.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], by portraitist Daniel Huntington ''c.'' 1865. In ''[[Federalist No. 78|The Federalist No. 78]]'', published 28 May 1788, Hamilton wrote: "The complete independence of the courts of justice is particularly essential in a limited constitution."]]

===Importance===
Judicial independence serves as a safeguard for the rights and privileges provided by a limited constitution and prevents [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislature|legislative]] encroachment upon those rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Alexander Hamilton|authorlink=Alexander Hamilton|contribution=The Federalist No. 78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-7DDxR-3KQC&amp;pg=PA524|editor=Jacob E. Cooke, ed.|title=The Federalist|location=Middletown, Conn.|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|year=1982|origyear=1961|pages=521–530 at 524|isbn=978-0-819-53016-5|quote=The complete independence of the courts of justice is particularly essential in a limited constitution. By a limited constitution I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority ... Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice; whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the constitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a foundation for the [[rule of law]] and [[democracy]]. The rule of law means that all authority and power must come from an ultimate source of law. Under an independent judicial system, the courts and its officers are free from inappropriate intervention in the [[judiciary]]'s affairs. With this independence, the judiciary can safeguard people's rights and freedoms which ensure equal protection for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Li-ann Thio|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|chapter=Rule of Law within a Non-liberal 'Communitarian' Democracy: The Singapore Experience|editor=Randall Peerenboom, ed.|title=Asian Discourses of Rule of Law: Theories and Implementation of Rule of Law in Twelve Asian Countries, France and the U.S.|location=London; New York, N.Y.|publisher=[[Routledge|RoutledgeCurzon]]|year=2004|pages=183–224 at 188|isbn=978-0-415-32613-1|quote=As the partisan administration of law erodes rule of law, a central institutional requirement is an independent, accessible judiciary.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of the law and the respect that people have for the law and the government which enacts it is dependent upon the judiciary's independence to mete out fair decisions. Furthermore, it is a pillar of economic growth as multinational businesses and investors have confidence to invest in the economy of a nation who has a strong and stable judiciary that is independent of interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Roger K. Warren|title=The Importance of Judicial Independence and Accountability|url=https://ncsc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/collection/judicial/id/207/download |format=PDF |publisher=[[National Center for State Courts]]|date=January 2003 |page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111072722/https://ncsc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/collection/judicial/id/207/download |archive-date=11 November 2018 |ref=CITEREFWarren (2003)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judiciary's role in deciding the validity of presidential and parliamentary elections also necessitates independence of the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 93A, and the {{Singapore legislation|title=Presidential Elections Act|cap=204A|ed=2007}}, ss. 71–80; and the {{Singapore legislation|title=Parliamentary Elections Act|cap=218|ed=2007}}, ss. 92–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
The disadvantages of having a judiciary that is seemingly too independent include possible abuse of power by judges. Self-interest, ideological dedication and even corruption may influence the decisions of judges without any [[separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] in place to prevent this abuse of power if the judiciary is completely independent.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=2–3}} The relationship between the judiciary and the executive is a complex series of dependencies and interdependencies which counter-check each other and must be carefully balanced. One cannot be too independent of the other. Furthermore, judicial support of the executive is not as negative as it seems as the executive is the branch of government with the greatest claim to democratic legitimacy. If the judiciary and executive are constantly feuding, no government can function well.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=3–5}}

Also, an extremely independent judiciary would lack judicial accountability, which is the duty of a public decision-maker to explain and justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or harm. Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure that justice is upheld.{{sfn|Warren (2003)|pages=4-5}}

==Economic basis==
[[Constitutional economics]] studies issues such as the proper distribution of national wealth including government spending on the judiciary. In transitional and developing countries, spending on the judiciary may be controlled by the executive. This undermines the principle of judicial independence because it creates a financial dependence of the judiciary on the executive. It is important to distinguish between two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and privileges) being the most dangerous, and private. State corruption of the judiciary can impede the ability of businesses to optimally facilitate the growth and development of a [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, the constitution also prohibits the legislative branch from reducing salaries of sitting judges.

==Development of the concept==

===National and international developments===

The development of judicial independence has been argued to involve a cycle of national law having an impact on international law, and international law subsequently impacting national law.&lt;ref name=Shetreet2009&gt;S Shetreet, ‘The Normative Cycle of Shaping Judicial Independence in Domestic and International Law: The Mutual Impact of National and International Jurisprudence and Contemporary Practical and Conceptual Challenges’ (2009) 10 Chicago Journal of International Law 275-332&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to occur in three phases: the first phase is characterized by the domestic development of the concept of judicial independence, the second by the spread of these concepts internationally and their implementation in international law, and the third by the implementation in national law of these newly formulated international principles of judicial independence.&lt;ref name=Shetreet2009/&gt;

A notable example illustrating this cycle is the United Kingdom. The first phase occurred in England with the original conception of judicial independence in the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally Shimon Shetreet book, Judges on Trial.&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase was evident when England’s concepts regarding judicial independence spread internationally, and were adopted into the domestic law of other countries; for instance, England served as the model for Montesquieu’s [[separation of powers]] doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;See Baron de Montesquieu, The Sfdfsdfpirit of the Laws (Hafner 1949) (Thomas Nugent, trans).&lt;/ref&gt; and the Founding Fathers of the [[US Constitution]] used England as their dominant model in formulating the Constitution’s Article III, which is the foundation of American judicial independence.&lt;ref&gt;Article III of the US Constitution provides that “the judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.”&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[common law]] countries, including Canada, Australia, and India, also adopted the British model of judicial independence.&lt;ref&gt;Shetreet, Judicial Independence. See also Peter H. Russell, The Judiciary in Canada: The Third Branch of Government (McGraw-Hill Ryerson 1987); John Bell, Judicial Cultures and Judicial Independence, 4 Cambridge YB Eur Legal Studies 47 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades the third phase of judicial independence has been evident in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;UK Human Rights Act - 1998&lt;/ref&gt; as it has been significantly influenced by judicial independence principles developed by international human rights constitutional documents. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) has had a significant impact on the conceptual analysis of judicial independence in England and Scotland. This process began in the 1990s with the ECtHR hearing UK cases and, more significantly, in the application of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in British law through the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], which came into force in the UK in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Act (1998), ch 42 (UK), available online at &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901121920/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1 |archivedate=2010-09-01 |df= }}&gt; (visited Mar 27, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Where British national law had previously impacted the international development of judicial independence, the British [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]]&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Reform Act (2005), ch 4 (UK). For a detailed analysis of the history of this act, see Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: The Politics of Constitutional Reform, 2006 Pub L 35; Lord Windlesham, The Constitutional Reform Act 2005: Ministers, Judges and Constitutional Change, 2005 Pub L 806. For accounts of the main players, see Lord Woolf, The Pursuit of Justice 161–74 (Oxford 2008); Lord Phillips, Constitutional Reform: One Year On, The Judicial Studies Board Annual Lecture (Mar 22, 2007); Lord Woolf, The Rule of Law and a Change in the Constitution, 2004 Camb L J 317; Tom Bingham, The Business of Judging: Selected Essays and Speeches 55–68 (Oxford 2000). All three authors served as lord chief justice in these formative years. Lord Woolf was active in the shaping of the legislation and Lord Phillips succeeded him&lt;/ref&gt; marked a shift, with international law now impacting British domestic law. The Constitutional Reform Act dramatically reformed government control over the administration of justice in England and Wales; importantly, it discontinued the position of the [[Lord Chancellor]], one of the country’s oldest constitutional offices, who was entrusted with a combination of legislative, executive, and judicial capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 294&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chancellor served as speaker of the Upper House of Parliament, the [[House of Lords]]; as a member of the executive branch and member of the senior cabinet; and as the head of the judiciary. Historically, the appellate function had a connection with the executive branch due to the types of cases typically heard – impeachment and the hearing of felony charges against peers.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stevens, Law and Politics: The House of Lords as a Judicial Body, 1800-1976 (University of North Carolina Press, 1978), at 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutional Reform Act established new lines of demarcation between the Lord Chancellor and the judiciary, transferring all the judicial functions to the judiciary and entrusting the Lord Chancellor only with what are considered administrative and executive matters. In addition, the Constitutional Reform Act replaced the Lord Chancellor by the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] as head of the judiciary, separated the judicial [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] from the legislative parliament, reforming it as the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], and creating a [[Judicial Appointments Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 294&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the Supreme Court was important, for it finally separated the highest court of appeal from the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, Ed., Blair's Britain, 1997-2007 (Cambridge University Press: 2007), at 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the United Kingdom, where judicial independence began over three hundred years ago, illustrates the interaction over time of national and international law and jurisprudence in the area of judicial independence. In this process, concepts and ideas have become enriched as they have been implemented in successive judicial and political systems, as each system has enhanced and deepened the concepts and ideas it actualized. In addition to the UK, similar developments of conceptual cross-fertilization can be seen internationally, for example in [[European Union law]],&lt;ref&gt;See Treaty on European Union, art F, 1992 OJ (C 191) 1 (Jul 29, 1992). Paragraph 2 of Article F states, “The Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . . . and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.”&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries such as Austria, and in other common law jurisdictions including Canada.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Valente v The Queen, [1985] 2 SCR 673 (Canada)&lt;/ref&gt;

===International standards===
The [[International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace]] produced the Mt. Scopus International Standards of Judicial Independence between 2007 and 2012. These built on the same association's New Delhi Minimum Standards on Judicial independence adopted in 1982 and their Montréal Universal Declaration on the Independence of Justice in 1983. Other influences they cite for the standards include the UN Basic Principles of Judicial Independence from 1985, the Burgh House Principles of Judicial Independence in International Law (for the international judiciary), Tokyo Law Asia Principles, Council of Europe Statements on judicial independence (particularly the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the independence, efficiency and role of judges), the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct 2002, and the American Bar Association's revision of its ethical standards for judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mt. Scopus Approved Revised International Standards of Judicial Independence Approved March 19, 2008|url=http://www.jiwp.org/#!mt-scopus-standards/c14de|publisher=International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace - International Project of judicial independence|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The justice system===

In recent years, the principle of judicial independence has been described as one of the core values of the justice system.&lt;ref&gt;Shimon Shetreet, Fundamental Values of the Justice System, 23 THE EUROPEAN BUSINESS LAW REVIEW 61-76, (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
[[Canada]] has a level of judicial independence entrenched in its [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]], awarding superior court justices various guarantees to independence under sections 96 to 100 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]. These include rights to tenure (although the Constitution has since been amended to introduce mandatory retirement at age 75) and the right to a salary determined by the [[Parliament of Canada]] (as opposed to the executive). In 1982 a measure of judicial independence was extended to inferior courts specializing in [[criminal law]] (but not [[civil law (common law)|civil law]]) by [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], although in the 1986 case ''[[Valente v. The Queen]]'' it was found these rights are limited. They do, however, involve tenure, financial security and some administrative control.

The year 1997 saw a major shift towards judicial independence, as the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in the [[Provincial Judges Reference]] found an unwritten constitutional norm guaranteeing judicial independence to all judges, including civil law inferior court judges. The unwritten norm is said to be implied by the [[preamble]] to the Constitution Act, 1867. Consequently, judicial compensation committees such as the [[Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission]] now recommend judicial salaries in Canada.
There are two types of judicial independence: institutional independence and decisional independence. Institutional independence means the judicial branch is independent from the executive and legislative branches. Decisional independence is the idea that judges should be able to decide cases solely based on the law and facts, without letting the media, politics or other concerns sway their decisions, and without fearing penalty in their careers for their decisions.

== Hong Kong ==
In [[Hong Kong]], independence of the judiciary has been the tradition since the territory became a British crown colony in 1842. After the 1997 transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to the [[People's Republic of China]] pursuant to the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], an international treaty registered with the [[United Nations]], independence of the judiciary, along with continuation of English [[common law]], has been enshrined in the territory's constitutional document, the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html "The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China"- Chapter 1], ''basiclaw.gov.HK'', 17 March 2008. Retrieved 2016-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html#section_4 "The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China"- Chapter 4, Section 4], ''basiclaw.gov.HK'', 17 March 2008. Retrieved 2016-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singapore ==
{{main|Judicial independence in Singapore}}
Judicial independence in Singapore is protected by the [[Constitution of Singapore]], statutes such as the State Courts Act and Supreme Court of Judicature Act, and the [[common law]]. To safeguard judicial independence, [[law of Singapore|Singapore law]] lays down special procedures to be followed before the conduct of [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] [[judicial officers of the Republic of Singapore#The Chief Justice, Judges of Appeal, and Judges and Judicial Commissioners of the High Court|judges]] may be discussed in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] and for their removal from office for misconduct, and provides that their remuneration may not be reduced during their tenure. By statute, judicial officers of the [[Subordinate Courts of Singapore|State Courts]], and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court have immunity from civil suits, and are prohibited from hearing and deciding cases in which they are personally interested. The common law provides similar protections and disabilities for Supreme Court judges.

The [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] and other Supreme Court judges are appointed by the [[President of Singapore]] acting on the advice of the [[Cabinet of Singapore]]. The President must consult the Chief Justice when appointing other judges, and may exercise personal discretion to refuse to make an appointment if he does not concur with the Cabinet's advice. Supreme Court justices enjoy [[security of tenure]] up to the age of 65 years, after which they cease to hold office. However, the Constitution permits such judges to be re-appointed on a term basis.

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===
{{main|Judiciary of England and Wales}}
====History====
During the [[middle ages]], under the Norman monarchy of the [[Kingdom of England]], the king and his [[Curia Regis]] held judicial power. Judicial independence began to emerge during the [[early modern period]]; more courts were created and a judicial profession grew. By the fifteenth century, the king's role in this feature of government became small.&lt;ref&gt;Justice [[Gerard La Forest]], [[Provincial Judges Reference]], [[Supreme Court of Canada]], para. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, kings could still influence courts and dismiss judges. The [[Stuart dynasty]] used this power frequently in order to overpower the [[Parliament of England]]. After the Stuarts were removed in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, some advocated guarding against royal manipulation of the judiciary. King [[William III of England|William III]] approved the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which established tenure for judges unless Parliament removed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independence|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/jud-acc-ind/independence/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justice Gerard La Forest, Provincial Judges Reference, para. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary usage====
Under the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], there are two important [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|conventions]] which help to preserve judicial independence. The first is that the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] does not comment on the cases which are before the court. The second is the principle of [[parliamentary privilege]]: that [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] are protected from prosecution in certain circumstances by the courts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Furthermore, the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitutional reform|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/constitutional-reform/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to try to promote the independence of the judiciary, the selection process is designed to minimize political interference. The process focuses on senior members of the judiciary rather than on politicians. Part 2 of the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]] aims to increase [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] among the judiciary.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The pay of judges is determined by an independent pay review body. It makes recommendations to the government after taking evidence from a variety of sources. The government accepts these recommendations and will traditionally implement them fully. As long as judges hold their positions in "good order," they remain in post until they wish to retire or until they reach the [[mandatory retirement]] age of 70.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Until 1 January 2010, the legal profession was self-regulating; with responsibility for implementing and enforcing its own professional standards and disciplining its own members. The bodies which performed this function were the [[Bar Council]] and the [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society]]. However, this self-regulation came to an end when approved regulators came under the regulation of the [[Legal Services Board]], composed of non-lawyers, following the passage of the [[Legal Services Act 2007]]. This saw the establishment of the [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]] to regulate [[solicitor]]s and the [[Bar Standards Board]] to regulate [[barrister]]s.&lt;ref name="legal_serves_act_2007"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Legal Services Act 2007|chapter=29|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States of America==

===Federal courts===
[[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] of the [[United States Constitution]] establishes the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] as part of the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]].

The Constitution provides that [[United States federal judge|federal judges]], including judges of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] "by and with the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]." Once appointed, federal judges:

{{quote|...both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.}}

Federal judges vacate office only upon death, resignation, or [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment and removal from office]] by [[United States Congress|Congress]]; only 13 federal judges have ever been impeached. The phrase "during good behavior" predates the Declaration of Independence. [[John Adams]] equated it with ''quamdiu se bene gesserint'' in a letter to the [[Boston Gazette]] published on 11 January 1773,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Works of John Adams, Vol 3|last=Adams|first=John|year=1851|publisher=Little and Brown|place=Boston|page=522}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase that first appeared in section 3 of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] in England.

The President is free to appoint any person to the federal bench, yet typically he consults with the [[American Bar Association]], whose Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rates each nominee "Well Qualified," "Qualified" or "Not Qualified."

===State courts===
[[State court (United States)|State courts]] deal with independence of the judiciary in many ways, and several forms of judicial selection are used for both [[trial court]]s and [[appellate court]]s (including [[state supreme court]]s), varying between states and sometimes within states. In some [[U.S. state|states]], judges are elected (sometime on a partisan ballot, other times on a [[nonpartisan]] one), while in others they are appointed by the [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]].

The 2000 case of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', in which a majority of the Supreme Court, including some appointees of President George H. W. Bush, overruled challenges to the election of the [[George W. Bush]] then pending in the [[Florida Supreme Court]], whose members had all been appointed by Democratic governors, is seen by many as reinforcing the need for judicial independence, both with regard to the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court. This case has increased focus and attention on judicial outcomes as opposed to the traditional focus on judicial qualifications.

'''Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities''' ({{lang-hr|Zakon o uporabi jezika i pisma nacionalnih manjina}}) is [[law]] which defines use of [[minority language]]s in [[Croatia]]. Additionally ''[[Croatian Constitutional law on national minorities rights]]'' and ''The Law on Education in language and script of national minorities'' explicitly define rights on usage of minority languages in Croatia.&lt;ref name="SDF-May 2007."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdf.hr/publikacije/provedba_UZPNM_na_lokalnom_nivou.pdf |title=Provedba Ustavnog zakona o pravima nacionalnih manjina u jedinicama lokalne i područne (regionalne) samouprave|accessdate=6 December 2014 |author=[[Serb Democratic Forum]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local governments to which this law applies ''([[Municipalities of Croatia]] with at least one third of members of ethnic minoritiy or municipality where right is defined by international agreement)'' are required to explicitly prescribe equal official use of minority language or script throughout its territory, regulate in detail realization of those rights and expressly prescribe all particular rights guaranteed by Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities.&lt;ref name="Naputak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istra-istria.hr/fileadmin/dokumenti/upravna_tijela/UO_za_tal_nac_zaj/Instrumenti_zastite_ljudskih_prava/III.Nacionalno-unutarnje_zakonodavstvoRH/3.Akti_Vlade,Ministarstava/III-3.12.Naputak_za_dosljednu_provedbu_Zakona_o_uporabi_jezika_i_pisma_nacionalnih_manjina_u_RH.pdf |title=NAPUTAK ZA DOSLJEDNU PROVEDBU ZAKONA O UPORABI JEZIKA I PISMA NACIONALNIH MANJINA U REPUBLICI HRVATSKOJ|accessdate=6 December 2014 |author=[[Ministry of Public Administration]]|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are required to define these rights in their local [[statute]]s.&lt;ref name="Naputak"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11772">A '''lean [[laboratory]]''' is one which is focused on processes, procedures, and infrastructure that deliver results in the most efficient way in terms of cost, speed, or both. Lean laboratory is a management and organization process derived from the concept of [[lean manufacturing]] and the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS).&lt;ref name="SmartLean13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2hEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160 |chapter=Chapter 5: Developing a lean approach to biopharmaceutical processes |title=Lean Biomanufacturing |author=Smart, N.J. |publisher=Elsevier |pages=147–98 |year=2013 |isbn=9781908818409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McPhersonHenry11"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-97J-8Zh2hkC&amp;pg=PA6 |title=Henry's Clinical Diagnosis and Management by Laboratory Methods |editor=McPherson, R.A.; Pincus, M.R. |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |page=6 |year=2011 |isbn=9781455726844}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of a lean laboratory is to reduce resource usage and costs while improving productivity, staff morale, and laboratory-driven outcomes.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McPhersonHenry11" /&gt;

==Overview==
Manufacturing companies, including medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers, operate in highly regulated environments&lt;ref name="TreleaseAdvising09"&gt;{{cite book |title=Advising High-Technology Companies |author=Trelease, N.T. |publisher=Practising Law Institute |year=2009 |isbn=9781402403965}}&lt;/ref&gt; which often necessitate a great deal of resources, time, and money being expended in the testing, release, and [[quality assurance]] of their products. Since the early 1990s, there has been a more widespread drive to adopt more lean approaches both in the [[Lean manufacturing|manufacturing]] and testing of products.&lt;ref name="HolwegTheGen07"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The genealogy of lean production |journal=Journal of Operations Management |last=Holweg |first=Matthias |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=420–437 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.jom.2006.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advances in lean thinking developed and refined in the automotive industry initially by Toyota (TPS)&lt;ref name="SmartLean13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McPhersonHenry11" /&gt; are now being used as best practices across most manufacturing sectors.&lt;ref name="HobbsHist03"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJa0rwBt74wC&amp;pg=PA13 |chapter=Chapter 1: History and Modern Applications of Lean Manufacturing |title=Lean Manufacturing Implementation: A Complete Execution Manual for Any Size Manufacturer |author=Hobbs. D.P. |publisher=J. Ross Publishing |pages=13–46 |year=2003 |isbn=9781932159141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of lean laboratory shares its origins with lean manufacturing and uses the same tools to deliver the most efficient and least wasteful processes, tools such as [[Kaizen]], [[Just in time (business)|Just In Time]] (JIT), [[Heijunka]], [[Kanban]], and [[Six Sigma]].&lt;ref name="SmartLean13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HobbsHist03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PyzdekTheSix14"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Six Sigma Handbook |author=Pyzdek, T.; Keller, P.A. |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |pages=704 |year=2014 |isbn=9780071840538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles of lean manufacturing have been difficult at times to migrate to laboratories because they are quite different from manufacturing environments. In the hospital laboratory, for example, difficulties arise with the "staunch adherence to traditional laboratory practices, complexity of workflow, and marked variability in sample numbers."&lt;ref name="DundasALean11"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Lean Laboratory: Operational Simplicity and Cost Effectiveness of the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel |journal=The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics |author=Dundas, N.E.; Siadie, M.S.; Revell, P.A. et al. |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=175–9 |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.jmoldx.2010.09.003 |pmid=21354052 |pmc=3128566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical labs, "the limiting belief" that procedures are so different that lean won't work often slow down adoption.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2hEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA237 |chapter=Chapter 7: Integration of biomanufacturing with lean laboratory operations |title=Lean Biomanufacturing |author=Smart, N.J. |publisher=Elsevier |pages=221–72 |year=2013 |isbn=9781908818409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to manufacturing environments, most analytical and microbiological laboratories have a relatively low volume of samples but a high degree of variability and complexity. Many standard lean tools are not a good fit; however, lean can still be applied to these types of labs.&lt;ref name="ZidelALean06"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Lean Guide to Transforming Healthcare: How to Implement Lean Principles in Hospitals, Medical Offices, Clinics, and Other Healthcare Organizations |author=Zidel, T. |publisher=ASQ Quality Press |pages=192 |year=2006 |isbn=9780873897013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A generic approach is not suitable for laboratories, but careful adaptation of the techniques based on a thorough understanding of lab operations will deliver significant benefits in terms of cost, speed, or both.

==Conventional laboratories==
It is a common occurrence for testing laboratories to suffer from long and variable [[lead time]]s. Some of the problems or issues which can be attributed to conventional or “non lean” laboratories include the following issues.

===Lack of focus===
Analysts and microbiologists are typically focused on test accuracy and individual test run efficiency. Very often, personnel are dedicated to specific tests and there is little or no control of the progress of individual samples through a sometimes highly variable test routing that can be dependent on product type and/or the intended market.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

===Long and variable lead times===
In many test laboratories, it is normal to find queues in front of each test where individual samples wait until enough similar samples arrive to constitute an "efficient test run." This approach causes long and variable lead times and, contrary to popular belief, does not result in higher [[productivity]].&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

===Ineffective "fast track" systems===
To deal with the long lead times, "fast track" systems are often developed in an effort to deal with urgent samples but these often become unworkable. Frequently, the proportion of samples designated as priority becomes so large that fast tracking quickly becomes ineffective.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

===High levels of work in progress===
Laboratories often maintain high levels of [[work in process]] (WIP), which inevitably results in significant (non value adding) effort being expended in controlling, tracking, and prioritizing samples and in planning analyst work. Companies often respond to this situation by investing in a [[laboratory information management system]] (LIMS) or some other IT system. However these systems do not in themselves improve performance. The underlying process by which work is organized and moves through the lab must first be re-engineered based on lean principles.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SmartLean13" /&gt;

===Volatile incoming workload===
For many testing laboratories, the incoming workload is inherently volatile, with significant peaks and dips. This causes low productivity (during dips) and/or poor lead time performance (during peaks). Very often the capacity of the lab is not well understood, and there is no mechanism to level or smooth the workload.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

==Implementing lean in the lab==
To address the above problems and issues, a lean laboratory uses lean principles to eliminate waste or [[Muda (Japanese term)|Muda]]. There are a number of principles that can be used, but the goal is always primarily focused on improving measurable performance and/or reducing costs.

===Specify value===
The first step in designing any lean laboratory is to specify value. Every activity in the laboratory is identified and categorizing as "value added," "non-value added" (from the customers perspective), and "incidental." Incidental work is non value add in itself but essential to enable value add tasks to be carried out. A significant focus of any lean lab initiative will be to eliminate or reduce the non value add activities.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

===Identify the value stream===
Another key lean step is to develop value stream maps of the overall release process. This should avoid the error of working on point solutions that only end up moving a bottleneck to another process and therefore do not deliver overall improvements. For example, there is no real value in reducing analytical laboratory lead times below the time of a release constraint test in a microbiology lab. You can however use increased velocity to help "level the load" or to maximize individual test run efficiency.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TappingValue02"&gt;{{cite book |title=Value Stream Management: Eight Steps to Planning, Mapping, and Sustaining Lean Improvements |author=Tapping, D.; Luyster, T.; Shuker, T. |publisher=Productivity Press |pages=176 |year=2002 |isbn=9781563272455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Make value flow and create pull===
A lean laboratory will normally have a defined sequence of tests and associated analyst roles that make good use of people and equipment. A key principle is to flow work through the laboratory so that once testing begins on a sample, it is kept moving and not allowed to queue between tests. This creates a focus and drive to reduce throughput time, which can be converted into a lead-time reduction or used to allow samples to wait in an incoming queue to facilitate level loading and /or grouping for efficiency.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

"Pull" is interpreted as testing according to customer priority. If this is not inherent in the order in which samples arrive, then the samples are taken from an incoming queue according to customer demand and thereafter processed in [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] order with no overtaking.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

===Level the load and the mix===
At its simplest, leveling the load (overall workload) and the mix (the mix of sample types) is about putting the same amount of work into the lab on a daily basis. This is probably the most critical step and potentially the most beneficial for the majority of testing laboratories. Successfully leveling a volatile load and mix will significantly improve productivity and/or lead time. The productivity improvement can be used to provide additional capacity or converted into a cost reduction.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

===Eliminate waste (muda)===
Lean laboratories continuously look to develop solutions and re-engineer processes to eliminate or reduce the non-value added and incidental tasks identified when specifying value.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

===Manage performance===
An essential part of lean in the laboratory is to manage and review a lab's performance daily, ensuring that [[Key Performance Indicator]]s (KPI's) are good and that the overall laboratory process is in control.&lt;ref name="SmartLean13-7" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9864">'''Love bombing''' is an attempt to [[social influence|influence]] a person by demonstrations of attention and affection. It can be used in different ways and can be used for either a positive or negative purpose. Members of the [[Unification Church of the United States]] (who reportedly coined the expression) use it to convey a genuine expression of friendship, fellowship, interest, or concern.&lt;ref name = Richardson2004/&gt; [[Anti-cult movement|Critics of cults]] use the phrase with the implication that the "[[love]]" is feigned and that the practice is [[psychological manipulation]] in order to create a feeling of unity within the group against a society perceived as hostile.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Tourish and [[Tim Wohlforth]], ''[[On the Edge (book)|On the Edge: Political Cults Right and Left]]'', Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2000, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have identified love bombing as a possible part of a [[cycle of abuse]] and have warned against it. In 2011 clinical psychologist [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] advocated love bombing in his book ''Love Bombing: Reset Your Child's Emotional Thermostat'', as a means for parents to rectify emotional problems in their children.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/22/oliver-james-love-bombing-children All you need is love bombing], ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
==Origin of the term==
The expression "love bombing" was coined by members of the [[Unification Church of the United States]] in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/mdtaskforce/loomis_testimony.htm| title=1999 Testimony of Ronald N.

In 1978 [[Sun Myung Moon]], the founder and then leader of the Unification Church, said:
:Unification Church members are smiling all of the time, even at four in the morning. The man who is full of love must live that way. When you go out witnessing you can caress the wall and say that it can expect you to witness well and be smiling when you return. What face could better represent love than a smiling face? This is why we talk about love bomb; Moonies have that kind of happy problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unification.net/1978/780723.html| title=Sun Myung Moon (1978) "We Who Have Been Called To Do God's Work" Speech in London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:A basic human need is for self-esteem.... Basically [love bombing] consists of giving someone a lot of positive attention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Langone|Langone, Michael]], ''[[Recovery from Cults]]'', 1995, [[W. W.

Psychology professor [[Margaret Singer]] popularized the concept.&lt;ref name = Richardson2004&gt;

:As soon as any interest is shown by the recruits, they may be ''love bombed'' by the recruiter or other cult members. This process of feigning friendship and interest in the recruit was originally associated with one of the early youth cults, but soon it was taken up by a number of groups as part of their program for luring people in. Love bombing is a coordinated effort, usually under the direction of leadership, that involves long-term members' flooding recruits and newer members with flattery, verbal seduction, affectionate but usually nonsexual touching, and lots of attention to their every remark. Love bombing - or the offer of instant companionship - is a deceptive ploy accounting for many successful recruitment drives.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Margaret (1996; 2003) ''Cults in Our Midst.''

He advises: "Stop, Look, and Listen" to avoid love bombing and to break off contact with the abuser, if possible, and seek support from family and friends.&lt;ref name = “archer”/&gt;

==Benign occurrences==
Excessive attention and affection does not constitute love bombing if there is no intent or pattern of further abuse.  Archer explains: 
:The key to understanding how love bombing differs from romantic courtship is to look at what happens next, after two people are officially a couple. If extravagant displays of affection continue indefinitely, if actions match words, and there is no devaluation phase, then it’s probably not love bombing. That much attention might get annoying after a while, but it’s not unhealthy in and of itself.&lt;ref name = “archer”&gt;[[Dale Archer]], [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/reading-between-the-headlines/201703/the-manipulative-partners-most-devious-tactic The manipulative partner’s most devious tactic], [[Psychology Today]], March 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s British author and psychologist Oliver James recommended love bombing as a technique for parents to help their troubled children. He described it as, “dedicating one-on-one time spoiling and lavishing your child with love, and, within reason, pandering to their every wish.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/love-bombing-kids-to-get-happy-results/story-fn6b3v4f-1226009612216 Love bombing kids to get happy results], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', February 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/over-to-you-kid/story-e6frg8h6-1226585874865# 'Love bombing' reminds parents how much fun it is to be with kids], ''[[The Australian]]'', March 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter for ''[[The Daily Express]]'' tried the technique with her son and reported:
:It’s not rocket science that showering a child with affection will impact positively on their behaviour but what surprised me was how much my behaviour changed. Love bombing enabled me to see my child through a fresh lens, my disposition towards him softened and he seemed to bask in the glow of positive attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/255817/It-took-one-day-to-change-my-son-s-bad-behaviour It took one day to change my son’s bad behaviour], ''[[The Daily Express]]'', June 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3356">A '''Lunar cycler''' or '''Earth–Moon cycler''' is an [[orbit]], or [[spacecraft]] therein, which periodically passes close by the [[Earth]] and the [[Moon]], using [[gravity assist]]s and occasional [[orbital maneuver|propellant-powered corrections]] to maintain its trajectories between the two. If the fuel required to reach a particular cycler orbit from both the Earth and the Moon is modest, and the travel time between the two along the cycler is reasonable, then having a spacecraft in the cycler can provide an efficient and regular method for space transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |authors=Kenneth D. Mease, Benjamin F. Villac, Josep M. Mondelo |collaboration=Jordi Casoliva Rodon |date=June 2008 |title=Economical Space Transportation Routes Between Earth, Moon, and Beyond |url=http://balsells.eng.uci.edu/docs/Mease-Progress-Report-June08.pdf |publisher=University of California |page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908000130/http://balsells.eng.uci.edu/docs/Mease-Progress-Report-June08.pdf |archive-date=2014-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Buzz Aldrin]] first suggested the use of cycler orbits in 1985 for the life support equipment and logistical supplies necessary for extensive manned exploration of the Moon and Mars. He also presented his thoughts on the benefits of using cycler spacecraft at the Space 88 Symposium in Albuquerque during a panel discussion on "Approaching the Construction Problems in Space." These trajectories must have the characteristic that they can be easily targeted for either launch or destination planet and that the times between encounters yield a reasonable stay time on the destination and provide for both routine and emergency return on a fairly regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;http://cbboff.org/UCBoulderCourse/documents/LunarCyclerPaper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One of the challenges for [[NASA]]'s [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer]] (IBEX) satellite was to find a stable orbit in [[cislunar space]], a region from outside the Earth's atmosphere to just beyond the Moon's orbit. The orbit in which the satellite was originally set could only be reliably predicted for about 3 years. Within cislunar space small changes in initial conditions could lead to very different trajectories years later. Because IBEX's original orbit was often closer to the Moon than the Earth, it was regularly performing gravity assists. The uncertainties in the initial orbit conditions would cause nearly identical trajectory predictions to eventually experience different gravity assist geometries, and the slightest change in that geometry during the encounter would cause huge differences in the subsequent satellite trajectory. Some predictions would hit the Earth and others would escape the Earth–Moon system. The new orbit keeps the apogee away from the Moon, reducing its sensitivity to gravity assists. IBEX can now predict this trajectory well beyond 11 years, allowing the satellite to easily observe the Sun's full [[solar cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astrogatorsguild.com/?p=92 |title=IBEX Lunar Synchronous Orbit |first=John |last=Carrico |date=25 June 2011 |website=The Astrogator's Guild |access-date=2016-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lynching''' is a premeditated [[extrajudicial killing]] by a group.  It is most often used to characterize informal public executions by a mob in order to punish an alleged transgressor, or to intimidate a group. It is an extreme form of informal group social control such as ''[[charivari]],'' [[skimmington]], [[Riding a rail|riding the rail]], and [[tarring and feathering]], and often conducted with the display of a public spectacle for maximum intimidation. It is to be considered an act of terrorism and punishable by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/701719807 | title=Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1874–1947 | publisher=North Carolina University Press | author=Wood, Amy Louise | year=2009 | isbn=9780807878118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dennisrhidalgo.wordpress.com/2013/11/27/lynching-and-the-susquehannocks/ | title=Lynching and the Susquehannocks | publisher=Wordpress | work=Blog | date=November 27, 2013 | accessdate=28 November 2013 | author=Hidalgo, Dennis Ricardo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instances of lynchings and similar mob violence can be found in every society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Berg, Manfred &amp; Wendt, Simon |date=2011| title=Globalizing Lynching History: Vigilantism and Extralegal Punishment from an International Perspective| publisher=Palgrave Macmillan| isbn= 978-0-230-11588-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22984858 | title=Vigilantism and the state in modern Latin America : essays on extralegal violence | publisher=Praeger | author=Huggins, Martha Knisely | year=1991 | location=New York | isbn=0275934764}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/657223792 | title=Lynching : American mob murder in global perspective | publisher=Ashgate | author=Thurston, Robert W. | year=2011 | location=Burlington, VT | isbn=9781409409083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lynching in the United States|In the United States, lynchings]] of African Americans, typically by [[hanging]], became frequent in the South during the period after the Reconstruction era and especially during the decades on either side of the turn of the 20th century. At the time, Southern states were passing new constitutions and laws to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchise African Americans]] and impose legal segregation and [[Jim Crow]] rule. Most lynchings were conducted by white mobs against black victims, often suspects taken from jail before they were tried by [[all-white juries]], or even before arrest. The political message—the promotion of [[white supremacy]] and black powerlessness—was an important element of the ritual. Lynchings were photographed and published as postcards, which were popular souvenirs in the U.S., to expand the intimidation of the acts.&lt;ref&gt;James Allen, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/without-sanctuary-lynching-photography-in-america/oclc/43312471 ''Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America''] , Santa Fe: Twin Palms Publishers, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moyers"/&gt; Victims were sometimes shot, burned alive, or otherwise tortured and mutilated in the public events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/27/news/mn-11152/2 "An Obsessive Quest to Make People See"].

The South had the states with the highest total numbers of lynchings.

== Etymology ==
The origins of the word "lynch" are obscure, but it likely originated during the [[American revolution]]. The verb comes from the phrase "Lynch Law", a term for a [[Extrajudicial punishment|punishment without trial]]. Two Americans during this era are generally credited for coining the phrase: [[Charles Lynch (jurist)|Charles Lynch]] and [[William Lynch (Lynch law)|William Lynch]], who both lived in Virginia in the 1780s. Charles Lynch has the better claim, as he was known to have used the term in 1782, while William Lynch is not known to have used the term until much later. There is no evidence that death was imposed as a punishment by either of the two men.&lt;ref name=quinion&gt;{{cite web |title=Lynch |author=Michael Quinion |work=World Wide Words |date=December 20, 2008 |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-lyn1.htm |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1782, Charles Lynch wrote that his assistant had administered "Lynch's law" to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]] "for Dealing with Negroes, &amp;c."&lt;ref name =EAAH1&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2006 |title=Lynching and Mob Violence |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African American History 1619–1895 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York City |last=Waldrep |first=Christopher |editor-last=Finkleman  |editor-first=Paul |volume=2 |page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the terms ''lynching'' and ''lynch law'' is traditionally attributed In the [[United States]] to Charles Lynch, a Virginia [[Quakers|Quaker]].&lt;ref name="Cutler, James E. 1905"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lynch-law: An Investigation Into the History of Lynching in the United States |first=James Elbert |last=Cutler |publisher=Longmans Green and Co. |year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23''ff''}} [[Charles Lynch (jurist)|Charles Lynch]] (1736–1796) was a Virginia planter and American Revolutionary who headed a county court in Virginia which incarcerated Loyalist supporters of the British for up to one year during the war. While he lacked proper jurisdiction, he claimed this right by arguing wartime necessity. Subsequently, he prevailed upon his friends in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] to pass a law that exonerated him and his associates from wrongdoing. He was concerned that he might face legal action from one or more of those so incarcerated, even though the American Colonies had won the war. This action by the Congress provoked controversy, and it was in connection with this that the term "Lynch law", meaning the assumption of extrajudicial authority, came into common parlance in the United States. Lynch was not accused of racist bias. He acquitted blacks accused of murder on three separate occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=atla;cc=atla;rgn=full%20text;idno=atla0088-6;didno=atla0088-6;view=image;seq=00732;node=atla0088-6%3A1 |title=The Atlantic Monthly Volume 0088 Issue 530 (Dec 1901) |publisher=Digital.library.cornell.edu |accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=webstersabridged&gt;[http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?action=search&amp;word=lynch+law&amp;resource=Webster%27s University of Chicago, ''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'' (1913 + 1828)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523010101/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?action=search&amp;word=lynch%20law&amp;resource=Webster%27s |date=2017-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was accused, however, of ethnic prejudice in his abuse of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] miners.&lt;ref name =EAAH1/&gt;

[[William Lynch (Lynch law)|William Lynch]] (1742–1820) from Virginia claimed that the phrase was first used in a 1780 compact signed by him and his neighbors in [[Pittsylvania County]]. While [[Edgar Allan Poe]] claimed that he found this document, it was probably a [[hoax]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

A 17th-century legend of [[James Lynch fitz Stephen]], who was [[Mayor of Galway]] in Ireland in 1493, says that when his son was convicted of murder, the mayor hanged him from his own house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mayor Lynch of Galway: A Review of the Tradition |first=James |last=Mitchell |journal=Journal of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society |volume=32 |date=1966–1971 |pages=5–72 |jstor=25535428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was proposed by 1904 as the origin of the word "lynch".&lt;ref name="matthews1904"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Term Lynch Law |first=Albert |last=Matthews |journal=Modern Philology |date=October 1904 |url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-432538/432538#page/n11 |volume=2 |number=2 |pages=173–195 : 183–184 |jstor=432538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dismissed by etymologists, both because of the distance in time and place from the alleged event to the word's later emergence, and because the incident did not constitute a lynching in the modern sense.&lt;ref name="matthews1904"/&gt;&lt;ref name=quinion/&gt;

The archaic verb ''linch'', to beat severely with a pliable instrument, to chastise or to maltreat, has been proposed as the etymological source; but there is no evidence that the word has survived into modern times, so this claim is also considered implausible.&lt;ref name="Cutler, James E. 1905"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

==History==
[[File:1891 New Orleans Italian lynching.jpg|190px|thumb|Rioters breaking into a parish prison during [[March 14, 1891, lynchings|anti-Italian lynchings]] in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, in 1891]]
Every society has had forms of extrajudicial punishments, including murder. The legal and cultural antecedents of American lynching were carried across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] by migrants from the [[British Isles]] to [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial North America]]. Collective violence was a familiar aspect of the early modern Anglo-American legal landscape. Group violence in the British Atlantic was usually nonlethal in intention and result. In the seventeenth century, in the context of political turmoil in England and unsettled social and political conditions in the American colonies, there arose rebellions and riots that took multiple lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/724308353 | title=The Roots of Rough Justice : Origins of American Lynching | publisher=University of Illinois Press | author=Pfeifer, Michael J. | year=2011 | location=Urbana, Illinois | isbn=9780252093098}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, during the decades before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (sometimes called the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era .281781.E2.80.931860.29|Antebellum era]]), free Blacks, Latinos in the South West, and runaways were the objects of racial lynching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/815043342 | title=Forgotten Dead : Mob Violence against Mexicans in the United States, 1848–1928 | publisher=Oxford University Press |author1=Carrigan, William D. |author2=Clive Webb | year=2013 | location=Oxford | isbn=9780195320350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But lynching attacks on [[African Americans|U.S. blacks]], especially in [[Southern United States|the South]], increased dramatically in the aftermath of Reconstruction, after [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] had been abolished and freed men gained the right to vote. The peak of lynchings occurred in 1892, after southern white Democrats had regained control of state legislatures. Many incidents were related to economic troubles and competition. At the turn of the 20th century, southern states passed new constitutions or legislation which effectively [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most blacks and many [[Poor White|poor white]]s, established [[racial segregation|segregation]] of public facilities by race, and separated blacks from common public life and facilities through [[Jim Crow]] rules. Nearly 3,500 [[African Americans]] and 1,300 [[White Americans|whites]] were [[Lynching in the United States|lynched in the United States]] between 1882 and 1968.&lt;ref name=tuskegee_umkc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html |title=Lynchings: By State and Race, 1882–1968 |pages= |accessdate=July 26, 2010 |quote=Statistics provided by the Archives at Tuskegee Institute. |publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629081241/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html |archivedate=June 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynching in the [[British Empire]] during the 19th century coincided with a period of violence which denied people participation in white-dominated society on the basis of race after the [[Emancipation Act]] of 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Thomas E.|last=Smith|title=The Discourse of Violence: Transatlantic Narratives of Lynching during High Imperialism|work=[[Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History]]|volume=8|issue=2|date=Fall 2007|doi=10.1353/cch.2007.0040|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lynching of Redmond, Roberson and Addison.jpg|right|thumb|Bodies of three men lynched in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], May 1892.]]
Lynchings took place in the United States both before and after the [[American Civil War]], most commonly in Southern states and Western frontier settlements and most frequently in the late 19th century.  It was performed without [[due process]] of law by self-appointed commissions, [[Ochlocracy|mobs]], or [[vigilantes]]  as a form of punishment for presumed criminal offences. At the first recorded lynching, in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] in 1835, a black man named McIntosh who killed a deputy sheriff while being taken to jail was captured, chained to a tree, and burned to death on a corner lot downtown in front of a crowd of over 1,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;William Hyde and Howard L. Conrad (eds.), [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofhi04hyde ''Encyclopedia of the History of St. Louis: A Compendium of History and Biography for Ready Reference: Volume 4.''] New York: Southern History Company, 1899; pg. 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Southern United States|the South]] in the antebellum era, members of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] or other people who opposed [[slavery]] were sometimes victims of mob violence. The largest lynching during the war and perhaps the largest lynching in all of U.S. history, was the lynching of 41 men in the [[Great Hanging at Gainesville|Great Hanging at Gainesville, Texas]] in October 1862. Most of the victims were hanged after an extrajudicial "trial" but at least fourteen of them did not receive that formality.&lt;ref&gt;McCaslin, Richard B. ''Tainted Breeze: The Great Hanging at Gainesville, Texas 1862'', Louisiana State University Press, 1994, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;  The men had been accused of [[insurrection]] or [[treason]].  Five more men were hanged in [[Decatur, Texas]] as part of the same sweep.&lt;ref&gt;McCaslin, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, southern whites struggled to maintain their social dominance. Secret vigilante and insurgent groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) instigated extrajudicial assaults and killings in order to keep whites in power and discourage [[freedmen]] from voting, working and getting educated. They also sometimes attacked Northerners, teachers, and agents of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]]. A study of the period from 1868 to 1871&lt;!-- which? needs cite --&gt; estimates that the KKK was involved in more than 400 lynchings. The aftermath of the war was a period of upheaval and social turmoil, in which most white men had been war veterans. Mobs usually alleged crimes for which they lynched blacks. In the late 19th century, however, journalist [[Ida B. Wells]] showed that many presumed crimes were either exaggerated or had not even occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Lynching |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576853/Lynching.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kx71O0QS?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576853/Lynching.html |archivedate=November 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mob violence arose as a means of enforcing [[white supremacy]] and it frequently verged on systematic political [[terrorism]].

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the Ku Klux Klan and others used lynching as a means to control blacks, forcing them to work for planters and preventing them from exercising their right to vote.&lt;ref name="New South 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barry A. Crouch 1868"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foner1988p119-123" /&gt;&lt;ref name="J.C.A. Stagg 1871"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Federal troops and courts enforcing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] largely broke up the Reconstruction-era Klan.

By the end of Reconstruction in 1877, with fraud, intimidation and violence at the polls, white Democrats regained nearly total control of the state legislatures across the South. They passed laws to make voter registration more complicated, reducing black voters on the rolls. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, from 1890 to 1908, ten of eleven Southern legislatures ratified new constitutions and amendments to effectively [[disenfranchise]] most African Americans and many poor whites through devices such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], property and residency requirements, and [[literacy tests]]. Although required of all voters, some provisions were selectively applied against African Americans. In addition, many states passed [[grandfather clauses]] to exempt white illiterates from literacy tests for a limited period. The result was that black voters were stripped from registration rolls and without political recourse. Since they could not vote, they could not serve on juries. They were without official political voice.

The [[ideology]] behind lynching, directly connected with the denial of political and social equality, was stated forthrightly by [[Benjamin Tillman]], [[governor of South Carolina]] and later a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]]:

{{quote|We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men, and we never will.

Lynchings declined briefly after the takeover in the 1870s. By the end of the 19th century, with struggles over labor and disenfranchisement, and continuing agricultural depression, lynchings rose again. The number of lynchings peaked at the end of the 19th century, but these kinds of murders continued into the 20th century. [[Tuskegee Institute]] records of lynchings between the years 1880 and 1951 show 3,437 African-American victims, as well as 1,293 white victims. Lynchings were concentrated in the [[Cotton Belt (region)|Cotton Belt]] ([[Mississippi]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dahleen Glanton, "Controversial exhibit on lynching opens in Atlanta" May 5, 2002, ''Chicago Tribune''. {{cite web|url=http://www.deltasigmatheta.com/archiv13.htm |title=Reproduced online |accessdate=2006-10-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311100917/http://www.deltasigmatheta.com/archiv13.htm |archivedate=March 11, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid influx of blacks into the North during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of the early 20th century disturbed the racial balance within Northern cities, exacerbating hostility between both black and white Northerners. Many whites defended their space with violence, intimidation, or legal tactics toward blacks, while many other whites migrated to more racially homogeneous regions, a process known as [[white flight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Amanda|title=Block by block : neighborhoods and public policy on Chicago's West Side|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-74663-0|pages=213–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, blacks in Northern cities experienced [[Racism in the United States|systemic discrimination]] in a plethora of aspects of life.&lt;ref name="Emerson"&gt;Michael O. Emerson, Christian Smith (2001). "Divided by Faith: Evangelical Religion and the Problem of Race in America". p. 42. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period, racial tensions exploded, most violently in Chicago, and lynchings—mob-directed hangings—increased dramatically in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Emerson"/&gt;

African Americans resisted through protests, marches, lobbying Congress, writing of articles, rebuttals of so-called justifications of lynching, organizing women's groups against lynching, and organizing integrated groups against lynching. African-American playwrights produced 14 anti-lynching plays between 1916 and 1935, ten of them by women.

After the release of the movie ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), which glorified lynching and the Reconstruction-era Klan, the Klan re-formed. Unlike its earlier form, it was heavily represented among urban populations, especially in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. In response to the massive immigration of people from [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Eastern Europe]], the Klan espoused an [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant]], [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-Jewish]] stance, in addition to exercising the oppression of blacks.

Members of mobs that participated in lynchings often took photographs of what they had done to their victims in order to spread awareness and fear of their power. Some of those photographs were published and sold as postcards. In 2000, [[James Allen (collector)|James Allen]] published a collection of 145 lynching photos in book form as well as online,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://withoutsanctuary.org/|author=Allen, James|title=Musarium: ''Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America''|accessdate=September 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with written words and video to accompany the images.

===Dyer Bill===
The [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]] was first introduced to the [[United States Congress]] in 1918 by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Leonidas C. Dyer]] of [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The bill was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1922, and in the same year it was given a favorable report by the [[United States Senate]] Committee. Its passage was blocked by white Democratic senators from the [[Solid South]], the only representatives elected since the southern states [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|had disenfranchised African Americans]] around the start of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon", ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000]. Accessed March 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dyer Bill influenced later anti-lynching legislation, including the [[Costigan-Wagner Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;Zangrando, NAACP Crusade, pp. 43–44, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dyer and Costigan Wagner bills were blocked by Senator [[William Borah]] (R-ID).&lt;ref&gt;''Black Americans in Congress, 1870–2007''. p. 178. Government Printing Office&lt;/ref&gt;

As passed by the House, the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"To assure to persons within the jurisdiction of every State the equal protection of the laws, and to punish the crime of lynching.... Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the phrase 'mob or riotous assemblage,' when used in this act, shall mean an assemblage composed of three or more persons acting in concert for the purpose of depriving any person of his life without authority of law as a punishment for or to prevent the commission of some actual or supposed public offense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/lynch/doc1.htm |title="Anti-Lynching Bill," 1918 |work=googleusercontent.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217081129/http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/lynch/doc1.htm |archivedate=2009-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the frequency of lynching dropped in the 1930s, there was a spike in 1930 during the Great Depression. For example, in North Texas and southern Oklahoma alone, four people were lynched in separate incidents in less than a month. In his book ''Russia Today: What Can We Learn from It?'' (1934), Sherwood Eddy wrote: "In the most remote villages of Russia today Americans are frequently asked what they are going to do to the [[Scottsboro boys|Scottsboro Negro boys]] and why they lynch Negroes."&lt;ref name=sherwoodeddy&gt;{{citation|first=Sherwood|last=Eddy|title=Russia Today: What Can We Learn from It?|pages=73, 151|publisher=Farrar &amp; Rinehar|year=1934|location=New York|oclc=1617454}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spike in lynchings occurred after [[World War II]], as tensions arose after veterans returned home. Whites tried to re-impose white supremacy over returning black veterans. The last documented mass lynching occurred in Walton County, Georgia, in 1946, when two war veterans and their wives were killed by local white landowners. 

By the 1950s, the [[Civil Rights Movement]] was gaining new momentum. It was spurred by the lynching of [[Emmett Till]], a 14-year-old youth from Chicago who was killed while visiting an uncle in Mississippi. His mother insisted on having an open-casket funeral so that people could see how badly her son had been beaten. The black community throughout the U.S. became mobilized.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt; Vann R.

Most, but not all, lynchings ceased by the 1960s.&lt;ref name=tuskegee_umkc/&gt;&lt;ref name=tuskegee_umkc2/&gt; The [[murder of James Craig Anderson]] in Mississippi in 2011 was the last recorded fatal lynching in the United States.

===Civil rights law===
Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241, is the civil rights conspiracy statute, which makes it unlawful for two or more persons to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person of any state, territory, or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him/her by the Constitution or the laws of the United States (or because of his/her having exercised the same) and further makes it unlawful for two or more persons to go in disguise on the highway or premises of another person with intent to prevent or hinder his or her free exercise or enjoyment of such rights. Depending upon the circumstances of the crime, and any resulting injury, the offense is punishable by a range of fines and/or imprisonment for any term of years up to life, or the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://miami.fbi.gov/statutes/title_18/section241.htm Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241 – Conspiracy Against Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224144931/http://miami.fbi.gov/statutes/title_18/section241.htm |date=2007-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Felony lynching===
The term 'felony lynching' was used in California law. It described the act of taking someone out of the custody of a police officer by "means of riot". It does not refer to the act of lynching, or murder by physical violence. This statute has been used to charge individuals who have tried to free someone from police custody. There have been several notable cases in the twenty-first century, some controversial, when a black person has attempted to free another black person from police custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-murrieta-protesters-charged-20140904-story.html|title=Murrieta immigration protesters charged with obstructing officers|first=James|last=Barragan|date=4 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 September 2017|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlantablackstar.com/2016/06/03/pasadena-black-lives-matter-activist-convicted-of-felony-lynching-could-spend-four-years-behind-bars/|title=Pasadena Black Lives Matter Activist Convicted of 'Felony Lynching', Could Spend Four Years Behind Bars|first=Tanasia|last=Kenney|date=3 June 2016|website=atlantablackstar.com|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed legislation by Senator [[Holly Mitchell]] removing the word "lynching" from the state's criminal code without comment after it received unanimous approval in a vote by state lawmakers.

=== Effects ===
A 2017 study found that exposure to lynchings in the post-Reconstruction South "reduced local black voter turnout by roughly 2.5 percentage points."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Daniel B.|last2=Troesken|first2=Werner|last3=Walsh|first3=Randall|date=2017-08-04|title=Political participation in a violent society: The impact of lynching on voter turnout in the post-Reconstruction South|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387817300615|journal=Journal of Development Economics|doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2017.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was other violence directed at blacks, particularly in campaign season. Most significantly for voting, from 1890 to 1908, southern states passed new constitutions and laws that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]] due to barriers to voter registration. These actions had major effects, soon reducing black voter turnout in most of the South to insignificant amounts.

Another 2017 study found supportive evidence of Stewart Tolnay and E. M. Beck's claim that lynchings were "due to economic competition between African American and white cotton workers".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christian|first=Cornelius|title=Lynchings, Labour, and Cotton in the US South: A Reappraisal of Tolnay and Beck|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498317301870|journal=Explorations in Economic History|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2017.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that lynchings were associated with greater black out-migration from 1920 to 1930, and higher state-level wages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Britain, a series of [[race riots]] broke out in several cities in 1919 between whites and black sailors. In [[Liverpool]], after a black sailor had been stabbed by two whites in a pub, his friends attacked the pub in revenge. In response, the police raided lodging houses with black occupants, accompanied by an "enraged lynch mob". Charles Wootton, a young black seaman who had not been involved in the attacks, was chased into the river [[Mersey]] and drowned after being pelted with missiles thrown by the mob, who chanted "Let him drown!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/liverpool-campaigns/anthony-walker/2005/08/03/the-roots-of-racism-in-city-of-many-cultures-100252-15813753/ "Roots of racism in City of Many Cultures"], ''Liverpool Echo'', August 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The Charles Wootton College in Liverpool was named in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jacqueline Nassy (2005).

In 1944, Wolfgang Rosterg, a German [[prisoner of war]] known to be unsympathetic to the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime, was lynched by [[Nazi]]s in [[Prisoner of War|POW]] Camp 21 in [[Comrie]], Scotland. At the end of [[World War II|the war]], five of the perpetrators were [[hanging|hanged]] at [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville]] Prison&amp;nbsp;– the largest multiple execution in 20th-century Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caledonia.tv/index.php?page=16 Caledonia.tv] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524202824/http://www.caledonia.tv/index.php?page=16 |date=2007-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation is less clear with regards to reported "lynchings" in Germany. Nazi propaganda sometimes tried to depict state-sponsored violence as spontaneous lynchings. The most notorious instance of this was "[[Kristallnacht]]", which the government portrayed as the result of "popular wrath" against Jews, but it was carried out in an organised and planned manner, mainly by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] men. Similarly, the approximately 150 confirmed murders of surviving crew members of crashed Allied aircraft in revenge for what Nazi propaganda called [[Strategic bombing during World War II|"Anglo-American bombing terror"]] were chiefly conducted by German officials and members of the police or the [[Gestapo]], although civilians sometimes took part in them. The execution of enemy aircrew without trial in some cases had been ordered by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] personally in May 1944. Publicly it was announced that enemy pilots would no longer be protected from "public wrath". There were secret orders issued that prohibited policemen and soldiers from interfering in favor of the enemy in conflicts between civilians and Allied forces, or prosecuting civilians who engaged in such acts.&lt;ref&gt;"Hamm 1944". polizeihistorischesammlung-paul.de.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-20794719.html|title=KRIEGSVERBRECHEN: Systematischer Mord - DER SPIEGEL 47/2001|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg,|last=Germany|website=www.spiegel.de|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary,

:"the assaults on crashed allied aviators were not typically acts of revenge for the bombing raids which immediately preceded them. [...] The perpetrators of these assaults were usually National Socialist officials, who did not hesitate to get their own hands dirty. The lynching murder in the sense of self-mobilizing communities or urban quarters was the exception."&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, Barbara: "Lynchmorde an alliierten Fliegern im Zweiten Weltkrieg".

"Die Übergriffe auf abgestürzte alliierte Flieger waren im Regelfall keine Racheakte für unmittelbar vorangegangene Bombenangriffe. [...] Täter waren in der Regel nationalsozialistische Funktionsträger, die keine Scheu davor hatten, selbst Hand anzulegen.

On November 23, 2004, in the Tlahuac lynching,&lt;ref&gt;Niels A. Uildriks (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PICx6XnX1DMC&amp;pg=PA201 ''Policing Insecurity: Police Reform, Security, and Human Rights in Latin America]. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; three Mexican undercover federal agents investigating a narcotics-related crime were lynched in the town of [[Tláhuac|San Juan Ixtayopan]] (Mexico City) by an angry crowd who saw them taking photographs and suspected that they were trying to abduct children from a primary school. The agents immediately identified themselves but they were held and beaten for several hours before two of them were killed and set on fire. The incident was covered by the media almost from the beginning, including their pleas for help and their murder.

By the time police rescue units arrived, two of the agents were reduced to charred corpses and the third was seriously injured. Authorities suspect that the lynching was provoked by the persons who were being investigated.
Both local and federal authorities had abandoned the agents, saying that the town was too far away for them to try to intervene. Some officials said they would provoke a massacre if the authorities tried to rescue the men from the mob.

{{Main|Necklacing}}

The practice of whipping and [[necklacing]] offenders and political opponents evolved in the 1980s during the [[apartheid]] era in [[South Africa]]. Residents of black townships formed "people's courts" and used whip lashings and deaths by necklacing in order to terrorize fellow blacks who were seen as collaborators with the government. Necklacing is the [[torture]] and execution of a victim by igniting a kerosene-filled rubber tire that has been forced around the victim's chest and arms. Necklacing was used to punish victims who were alleged to be traitors to the black liberation movement along with their relatives and associates. Sometimes the "people's courts" made mistakes, or they used the system to punish those whom the anti-Apartheid movement's leaders opposed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1991/southafrica1/6.htm 4.

{{See also|Caste-related violence in India}}

In [[India]], lynchings may reflect internal tensions between ethnic communities. An example is the 2006 [[Kherlanji massacre]], where four members of a [[Dalit]] [[caste]] family were slaughtered by [[Kunbi]] caste members in Khairlanji, a village in the [[Bhandara district]] of [[Maharashtra]]. Though this incident was reported as an example of "upper" caste violence against members of a "lower" caste, it was found to be an example of communal violence. It was retaliation against a family who had opposed the Eminent Domain seizure of its fields so a road could be built that would have benefitted the group who murdered them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/news/age-old-rivalry-behind-khairlanji-violence/9290 |title=Age old rivalry behind Khairlanji violence Video |publisher=NDTV.com |date=November 21, 2006|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women of the family were paraded naked in public, before being mutilated and murdered.

==In popular culture==
==="Strange Fruit"===
In 1937, [[Abel Meeropol]], a [[Jew]]ish schoolteacher from [[New York City|New York]], saw a copy of the photograph of a lynching in Marion, Indiana. He said that the photograph "haunted me for days" and inspired him to write the poem "[[Strange Fruit]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cross and the Lynching Tree|last=Cone|first=James H.|publisher=Oribis Books|year=2011|isbn=|location=Maryknoll, New York|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in the ''New York Teacher'' and later in the magazine ''[[New Masses]]'', in both cases under the pseudonym Lewis Allan. This poem was set to music, also written by Meeropol, and the song was performed and popularized by [[Billie Holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/strangefruit/film.html|website=Independent Lens|author=PBS|title=Strange Fruit}} PBS ''Independent Lens'' credits the music as well as the words to Meeropol, though Billie Holiday's autobiography and the Spartacus article credit her with co-authoring the song.&lt;/ref&gt; The song reached 16th place on the charts in July 1939.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The song has been performed by many other singers, including [[Nina Simone]].

===''The Hateful Eight''===
The finale of the 2015 film ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' set in post Civil War America is a detailed and close focused depiction of the lynching of a white woman, prompting some debate about whether it is a political commentary on racism and hate in America or if it was simply created for entertainment value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/25/movies/review-quentin-tarantinos-the-hateful-eight-blends-verbiage-and-violence.html|title=Review: Quentin Tarantino’s ‘The Hateful Eight’ Blends Verbiage and Violence|first=A.

In [[abstract algebra]], a '''matrix ring''' is any collection of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over some ring ''R'' that form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] under [[matrix addition]] and [[matrix multiplication]] {{harv|Lam|1999}}. The set of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices with entries from ''R'' is a matrix ring denoted M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''), as well as some subsets of infinite matrices which form '''infinite matrix rings'''. Any subring of a matrix ring is a matrix ring.

When ''R'' is a commutative ring, the matrix ring M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is an [[associative algebra]], and may be called a '''matrix algebra'''.  For this case, if ''M'' is a matrix and ''r'' is in ''R'', then the matrix ''Mr'' is the matrix ''M'' with each of its entries multiplied by ''r''.

This article assumes that ''R'' is an [[associative ring]] with a unit {{nowrap|1 ≠ 0}}, although matrix rings can be formed over rings without unity.

== Examples ==
* The set of all {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices over an arbitrary ring ''R'', denoted M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').  This is usually referred to as the "full ring of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices".  These matrices represent endomorphisms of the free module ''R''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The set of all upper (or set of all lower) [[triangular matrices]] over a ring.
* If ''R'' is any ring with unity, then the ring of endomorphisms of &lt;math&gt;M=\bigoplus_{i\in I}R&lt;/math&gt; as a right ''R''-module is isomorphic to the ring of '''column finite matrices''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{CFM}_I(R)\,&lt;/math&gt; whose entries are indexed by {{nowrap|''I'' × ''I''}}, and whose columns each contain only finitely many nonzero entries.  The endomorphisms of ''M'' considered as a left ''R'' module result in an analogous object, the '''row finite matrices''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{RFM}_I(R)&lt;/math&gt; whose rows each only have finitely many nonzero entries.
* If ''R'' is a [[Banach algebra]], then the condition of row or column finiteness in the previous point can be relaxed.  With the norm in place, [[absolutely convergent series]] can be used instead of finite sums.  For example, the matrices whose column sums are absolutely convergent sequences form a ring.  Analogously of course, the matrices whose row sums are absolutely convergent series also form a ring.  This idea can be used to represent [[Hilbert space#Operators on Hilbert spaces|operators on Hilbert spaces]], for example.
* The intersection of the row and column finite matrix rings also forms a ring, which can be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{RCFM}_I(R)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The algebra M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') of [[2 × 2 real matrices]], which is [[ring isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[split-quaternion]]s, is a simple example of a non-commutative associative algebra. Like the [[quaternion]]s, it has [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] 4 over '''R''', but unlike the quaternions, it has [[zero divisor]]s, as can be seen from the following product of the [[matrix unit]]s: {{nowrap|1=''E''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;''E''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, hence it is not a [[division ring]]. Its invertible elements are [[nonsingular matrix|nonsingular matrices]] and they form a [[group (mathematics)|group]], the [[general linear group]] {{nowrap|GL(2, '''R''')}}.
*If ''R'' is [[commutative ring|commutative]], the matrix ring has a structure of a [[*-algebra]] over ''R'', where the [[involution (mathematics)#Ring theory|involution]] * on M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is the [[matrix transpose|matrix transposition]]. 
*If ''A'' is a [[C*-algebra]], then M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') consists of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices with entries from the C*-algebra ''A'', which is itself a C*-algebra. If ''A'' is non-unital, then M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') is also non-unital. Viewing ''A'' as a norm-closed subalgebra of the continuous operators ''B''(''H'') for some Hilbert space ''H'' (that there exists such a Hilbert space and isometric *-isomorphism is the content of the [[Gelfand-Naimark theorem]]), we can identify M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') with a subalgebra of ''B''(''H''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;\oplus n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). For simplicity, if we further suppose that ''H'' is separable and ''A'' &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; ''B''(''H'') is a unital C*-algebra, we can break up ''A'' into a matrix ring over a smaller C*-algebra. One can do so by fixing a [[Projection_(linear_algebra)#Orthogonal_projections|projection]] ''p'' and hence its orthogonal projection 1 - ''p''; one can identify ''A'' with &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} pAp &amp; pA(1-p) \\ (1-p)Ap &amp; (1-p)A(1-p) \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, where matrix multiplication works as intended because of the orthogonality of the projections. In order to identify ''A'' with a matrix ring over a C*-algebra, we require that ''p'' and 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'' have the same ″rank″; more precisely, we need that ''p'' and 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'' are Murray–von Neumann equivalent, i.e. there exists a [[partial isometry]] ''u'' such that ''p'' = ''uu''* and 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'' = ''u''*''u''. One can easily generalize this to matrices of larger sizes.
* Complex matrix algebras M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') are, up to isomorphism, the only simple associative algebras over the field '''C''' of [[complex number]]s. For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, the matrix algebra M&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') plays an important role in the theory of [[angular momentum]]. It has an alternative basis given by the [[identity matrix]] and the three [[Pauli matrices]]. ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') was the scene of early abstract algebra in the form of [[biquaternion]]s.
* A matrix ring over a field is a [[Frobenius algebra]], with Frobenius form given by the trace of the product: {{nowrap|1=''σ''(''A'', ''B'') = tr(''AB'')}}.

==Structure==
* The matrix ring M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') can be identified with the [[ring of endomorphisms]] of the [[free module|free ''R''-module]] of rank ''n'', {{nowrap|M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') ≅ End&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.{{clarify|Is R^n here a right module?|date=June 2017}} The procedure for [[matrix multiplication]] can be traced back to compositions of endomorphisms in this endomorphism ring.
* The ring M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''D'') over a [[division ring]] ''D'' is an [[Artinian ring|Artinian]] [[simple ring]], a special type of [[semisimple ring]].  The rings &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{CFM}_I(D)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{RFM}_I(D)&lt;/math&gt; are ''not'' simple and not Artinian if the set ''I'' is infinite, however they are still [[full linear ring]]s.
* In general, every semisimple ring is isomorphic to a finite direct product of full matrix rings over division rings, which may have differing division rings and differing sizes.  This classification is given by the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]].
* There is a one-to-one correspondence between the two-sided [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') and the two-sided ideals of ''R''.  Namely, for each ideal ''I'' of ''R'', the set of all {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices with entries in ''I'' is an ideal of M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''), and each ideal of M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') arises in this way.  This implies that M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is [[simple ring|simple]] if and only if ''R'' is simple. For {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}}, not every left ideal or right ideal of M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') arises by the previous construction from a left ideal or a right ideal in ''R''. For example, the set of matrices whose columns with indices 2 through ''n'' are all zero forms a left ideal in M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').
* The previous ideal correspondence actually arises from the fact that the rings ''R'' and M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') are [[Morita equivalent]]. Roughly speaking, this means that the category of left ''R'' modules and the category of left M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') modules are very similar. Because of this, there is a natural bijective correspondence between the ''isomorphism classes'' of the left ''R''-modules and the left M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'')-modules, and between the isomorphism classes of the left ideals of ''R'' and M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''). Identical statements hold for right modules and right ideals.  Through Morita equivalence, M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') can inherit any properties of ''R'' which are Morita invariant, such as being [[simple ring|simple]], [[Artinian ring|Artinian]], [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]], [[Prime ring|prime]] and numerous other properties as given in the [[Morita equivalence]] article.

== Properties ==

* The matrix ring ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is [[commutative ring|commutative]] if and only if ''R'' is [[commutative ring|commutative]] and {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}}. In fact, this is also true for the subring of upper triangular matrices.  Here is an example for 2×2 matrices (in fact, upper triangular matrices) which do not commute:
::&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}\,
&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:: &lt;math&gt;  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 0 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}.\,
&lt;/math&gt;
: This example is easily generalized to ''n''×''n'' matrices.
* For ''n'' &amp;ge; 2, the matrix ring M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') has [[zero divisor]]s and [[nilpotent element]]s, and again, the same thing can be said for the upper triangular matrices. An example in 2×2 matrices would be
:: &lt;math&gt;  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 0 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}\,
&lt;/math&gt;.

* The [[center (ring theory)|center]] of a matrix ring over a ring ''R'' consists of the matrices which are scalar multiples of the [[identity matrix]], where the scalar belongs to the center of ''R''.
* In linear algebra, it is noted that over a field ''F'', M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'') has the property that for any two matrices ''A'' and ''B'', {{nowrap|1=''AB'' = 1}} implies {{nowrap|1=''BA'' = 1}}.  This is not true for every ring ''R'' though.  A ring ''R'' whose matrix rings all have the mentioned property is known as a [[stably finite ring]] {{harv|Lam|1999|p=5}}.

==Diagonal subring==

Let ''D'' be the set of [[diagonal matrices]] in the matrix ring M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''), that is the set of the matrices such that every nonzero entry, if any, is on the main diagonal.  Then ''D'' is closed under [[matrix addition]] and [[matrix multiplication]], and contains the [[identity matrix]], so it is a [[subalgebra]] of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').

As an [[algebra (ring theory)|algebra over R]], ''D'' is [[algebra homomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[product of rings|direct product]] of ''n'' copies of ''R''. It is a [[free module|free ''R''-module]] of dimension ''n''. The [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]]s of ''D'' are the diagonal matrices such that the diagonal entries are themselves idempotent.

===Two dimensional diagonal subrings===
When ''R'' is the field of [[real number]]s, then the diagonal subring of M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is isomorphic to [[split-complex number]]s. When ''R'' is the field of [[complex number]]s, then the diagonal subring is isomorphic to [[bicomplex number]]s. When ''R'' = ℍ, the [[division ring]] of [[quaternion]]s, then the diagonal subring is isomorphic to the ring of [[split-biquaternion]]s, presented in 1873 by [[William K. Clifford]].

==Matrix semiring==
In fact, ''R'' only needs to be a [[semiring]] for M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') to be defined. In this case, M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is a semiring, called the '''matrix semiring'''. Similarly, if ''R'' is a commutative semiring, then M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is a '''{{visible anchor|matrix semialgebra}}'''.

For example, if ''R'' is the [[Boolean semiring]] (the [[Two-element Boolean algebra]] ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{0,1} with 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1), then M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is the semiring of [[binary relation]]s on an ''n''-element set with union as addition, [[composition of relations]] as multiplication, the [[empty relation]] ([[zero matrix]]) as the zero, and the [[identity relation]] ([[identity matrix]]) as the unit.&lt;ref name="droste"&gt;Droste, M., &amp; Kuich, W. (2009). Semirings and Formal Power Series. ''Handbook of Weighted Automata'', 3–28. {{doi|10.1007/978-3-642-01492-5_1}}, pp. 7–10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metaphysical solipsism''' is the variety of [[idealism]] which asserts that nothing exists externally to ''this one mind'', and since ''this mind'' is the whole of reality then the "external world" was never anything more than an ''idea''.  It can also be expressed by the assertion "there is nothing external to these present experiences", in other words, no reality exists beyond whatever is presently being sensed.  The aforementioned definition of solipsism entails the non-existence of anything presently unperceived including the external world, causation, other minds (including God's mind or a subconscious mind), the past or future, and a subject of experience.  Despite their ontological non-existence, these entities may nonetheless be said to "exist" as ''useful descriptions'' of the various experiences and thoughts that constitute 'this' mind.  The solipsistic self is described by Wittgenstein in the Tractatus: "The self of solipsism shrinks to a point without extension and there remains the reality co-ordinated with it" (''TLP'' 5.64).

There are weaker versions of metaphysical solipsism, such as Caspar Hare's [[egocentric presentism]] (or [[perspectival realism]]), in which other persons are conscious but their experiences are simply not ''present''. Similarly, J. J. Valberg develops a concept of one's [[personal horizon]] and discusses how it is in a sense ''the'' (preeminent) horizon, stating that "we are all solipsists" in his sense of solipsism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valberg|first=J. J.|title=Dream, Death, and the Self|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691128597|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8416.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for metaphysical solipsism==

The argument in favor of solipsism:

* The only thing one has direct access to is the contents of one's own mind (one's mental states). What one knows most certainly are one's mental states – one's thoughts, experiences, emotions, and so on.
* Just because one sees an object does not mean that the object exists. One could be dreaming or hallucinating.  There is no direct conceptual or logically necessary link between the mental and the physical.
* The experiences of a given person are necessarily private to that person. The contents of one's mind are the only things one has direct access to. One cannot get ‘outside’ of one's mind to encounter any other objects including other persons. Other minds are even more removed.

The basic form of the argument:

* Person's mental states are the only things they have access to.
* One cannot conclude the existence of anything outside of their mental states.
** Therefore, only their mental states exist.
Similar philosophy is found in Hindu religion, namely [[drishti-srishti-vada]].&lt;ref name="Drishti-sristi-vada"&gt;[http://www.vmission.org.in/vedanta/articles/drishtishristi.htm], Drishti-sristi-vada.&lt;/ref&gt;
In teachings of Ramana Maharshi there are two cues on solipsism:

"Jiva is called so because he sees the world. A dreamer sees many jivas in a dream, but all of them are not real. The dreamer alone exists and he sees all. So it is with the individual and the world. There is the creed of only one Self, which is also called the creed of only one jiva. It says that the jiva is the only one who sees the whole world and the lives therein."

==Criticism of metaphysical solipsism==

One reason for the lack of support of this philosophical position is how strange it would be for a solipsist to preach solipsism – as if to convince everyone around them that they are purely a figment of the author's own imagination. The very idea of communicating philosophical ideas would be arbitrary to a true solipsist, as according to them, there is no other mind with whom they would communicate their beliefs.

[[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] commented, on the same theme:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As against solipsism, it is to be said, in the first place, that it is psychologically impossible to believe, and is rejected in fact even by those who mean to accept it. I once received a letter from an eminent logician, Mrs. [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]],
saying that she was a solipsist, and was surprised that there were no others. Coming from a logician, this surprised me. The fact that I cannot believe something does not prove that it is false, but it does prove that I am insincere and frivolous if I pretend to believe it." (Russell, p. 180).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;The basic argument for solipsism suffers a logical error as well. It is argued that, because the mind can not conclude the existence of anything external, therefore nothing external exists. But this conclusion does not follow, only that the existence of externalities cannot be known. It is just as logically consistent that there are external realities/minds/etc. as there are not when experience cannot be verified either true or false.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Negative room.png|thumb|Schematic of a network of rooms where air (shown in blue) flows in one direction from the corridor into the negative pressure room (green). Exhaust air is safely removed from the area through a ventilation system.]]
[[vacuum|Negative pressure]] is generated and maintained by a ventilation system that removes more exhaust air from the room than air is allowed into the room. Air is allowed into the room through a gap under the door (typically about one half-inch high). Except for this gap, the room should be as airtight as possible, allowing no air in through cracks and gaps, such as those around windows, light fixtures and electrical outlets. Leakage from these sources can compromise or eliminate room negative pressure.&lt;ref name="camil"/&gt;

==Smoke test==
A [[smoke testing (mechanical)#Infectious disease control|smoke test]] can help determine whether a room is under negative pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.state.mn.us/DocPolicy2/Document/500.522.htm Title: Negative Pressure Isolation Rooms], Minnesota Department of Corrections, Issue date 2007-07-03. Retrieved 2010-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  A tube containing smoke is held near the bottom of the negative pressure room door, about 2 inches in front of the door. The smoke tube is held parallel to the door, and a small amount of smoke is then generated by gently squeezing the bulb. Care is taken to release the smoke from the tube slowly to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube does not overpower the air velocity. If the room is at negative pressure, the smoke will travel under the door and into the room. If the room is not a negative pressure, the smoke will be blown outward or will stay stationary.

'''Nuamthong Praiwan''' ({{lang-th|นวมทอง ไพรวัลย์}}; {{RTGS|Nuamthong Phraiwan}}) (1946–1 November 2006)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070121184910/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/02/headlines/headlines_30017813.php Taxi driver 'sacrificed himself for democracy']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/world/asia/01iht-asia.3356016.html Briefly: Government troops hit rebel positions from air - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Thai people|Thai]] taxi driver who drove his taxi into a [[army tank|tank]] in protest after the [[2006 Thailand coup d'état|military coup of 2006]]. He was later found hanging from a [[Vibhavadi Rangsit Road|pedestrian footbridge]]. Officials found a suicide note and later ruled his death a suicide. His sacrifices were praised by several democracy activists.

==Driving taxi into tank==
At 6 am, Saturday 30 September 2006, Nuamthong drove his taxi, spray painted with the words "[CDR is] destroying the country," and "Sacrificing life", into an M41 Walker Bulldog tank at Bangkok's Royal Plaza. Nuamthong was severely injured and taken to a police station nearby. "I did it intentionally to protest the junta that has destroyed our country, and I painted all the words myself," noted Nuamthong to reporters from his bed at Vachira Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015059 A man collides his taxi with tank], 30 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matichon, [http://www.norsorpor.com/go2.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.matichon.co.th%2Fbreaking-news%2Fbreaking-news.php%3Fnid%3DMjAwNjA5MzAtMTYwNTA4 Matichon Information Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was released from the hospital on 12 October, and attended the 33rd anniversary of the [[History of Thailand (1932-1973)#The 1973 democracy movement|14 October 1973 democratic uprising]].

==Death==
Nuamgthong's body was found hanging, with a hood covering his face, from a footbridge on [[Vibhavadi Rangsit Road|Vibhavadi Rangsit road]] near the headquarters of [[Thai Rath]] newspaper in [[Bangkok]] on 1 November 2006. Police ruled the death a suicide after forensic tests were stated to have shown no traces of a physical assault or struggle. Although Nuamthong's body was found with a suicide note, family members testified that he had given no hint of being depressed or about to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bact.blogspot.com/2006/11/nuamthong-praiwal.html bact' is a name: Nuamthong Praiwal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{th icon}} Prachatai, [http://www.prachatai.com/05web/th/home/page2.php?mod=mod_ptcms&amp;ContentID=5657&amp;SystemModuleKey=HilightNews&amp;System_Session_Language=Thai จดหมายจากใจแท็กซี่พลีชีพ “ชาติหน้าเกิดมาคงไม่พบเจอการปฏิวัติอีก], 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nuamthong wore a black T-shirt with a drawing of the [[Democracy Monument (Bangkok)|Democracy Monument]] and a poem about the power of the masses. Newspaper clippings about his crash into the army tank were also found on his body. His wife, Boonchu, said he had given no farewells or done anything that would suggest he was planning to kill himself.&lt;ref&gt;The Bangkok Post, [http://bangkokpost.net/News/02Nov2006_news03.php Taxi driver hangs self in protest at coup d'etat], 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30017724 Surayud believes there will be no copycat of suicide taxi driver], 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife noted, "I couldn't be more sad losing the love of my life and the leader of my family. I didn't think he would be this brave, but I'm very proud of him for sacrificing for the country."&lt;ref name="nationmultimedia.com"&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/02/headlines/headlines_30017813.php Taxi driver 'sacrificed himself for democracy'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121184910/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/02/headlines/headlines_30017813.php |date=2007-01-21 }}, 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral==
Funeral rites were held at [[Wat]] Bua Kwan in [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]]'s Muang district. A score of senior police showed up at his funeral at Wat Bua Kwan in Nonthaburi to "keep the peace" while pro-democracy groups sent representatives and flower wreaths to honour his death.

His wife later attempted to transport his coffin to the 14 October 1973 Memorial on Ratchadamnoen road for bathing rituals. Police prevented her van from arriving at the Memorial.

About 200 people attended the second night of Nuamthong's funeral at Wat Bua Kwan. Among them were military and police officers, politicians from the Thai Rak Thai Party and [[National Human Rights Commission (Thailand)|National Human Rights Commissioner]] Jaran Dithapichai. [[Sant Hathirat]] read a statement declaring Nuamthong a "democracy martyr."&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/03/national/national_30017926.php iTV rapped for report on driver's final words] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115134158/http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/11/03/national/national_30017926.php |date=2006-11-15 }}, 3 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also praised by activist and former senator Prateep Ungsongtham Hata, who noted, "Uncle Nuamthong has made the biggest sacrifice for democracy. I fought for democracy all my life but don't have the courage to do as much as he did."

Junta deputy spokesperson [[Akara Tipparoj]] apologised for his earlier claim that nobody would hurt themselves for political ideals and claimed he planned to attend the funeral.

The Young People for Democracy Movement (YPD) condemned Akara's views as ignorant and noted that "His remark is an insult, as Thailand has a long history of people dying to defend democracy from dictatorship."

Prime Minister General [[Surayud Chulanont]] said he was saddened by the news but doubted there would be copycat suicide attempts.&lt;ref name="sensitivity" /&gt;

After his death, an interview Nuamthong had earlier given was partially aired by [[iTV (Thailand)|iTV]]. The broadcast came to an abrupt end after the Director of Army-owned [[Royal Thai Army Radio and Television Channel 5|Channel 5]] called to give a warning.&lt;ref name="nationmultimedia.com"/&gt; Additional troops were dispatched [[Censorship in Thailand|to keep order at the station]].

In [[population dynamics]] and [[population ecology]], '''overshoot''' occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term [[carrying capacity]] of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thesenecaeffect.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/humans-in-ecological-overshoot-collapse-now-to-avoid-a-larger-catastrophe/|title=Humans in ecological overshoot: Collapse now to avoid a larger catastrophe|last=schreef|first=Nathan Surendran|date=2014-12-01|website=The Seneca Effect|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in [[population density]]. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed 'overshoot-and-collapse'.

Overshoot can occur due to lag effects.  [[Reproduction]] rates may remain high relative to the [[Mortality rate|death rate]].&lt;ref name="eaec"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology and Ecosystem Conservation |last=Schmitz |first=Oswald J. |author2= |year=2013 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=1597265985 |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ip7phSL199YC |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entire [[ecosystem]]s may be severely affected and sometimes reduced to less-[[Complexity|complex]] states due to prolonged overshoot.&lt;ref name="geap"&gt;{{cite book |title=Green Ethics and Philosophy: An A-to-Z Guide Volume 8 of The SAGE Reference Series on Green Society: Toward a Sustainable Future-Series Editor: Paul Robbins |chapter=Development and Ethical Sustainability |last=Howes |first=Michael |editor1-first=Julie |editor1-last=Newman |year=2011 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=1452266220 |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l7e9AwAAQBAJ |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The eradication of disease can trigger overshoot when a population suddenly exceeds the land's carrying capacity. An example of this occurred on the [[Horn of Africa]] when [[smallpox]] was eliminated. A region that had supported around 1 million [[pastoralists]] for centuries was suddenly expected to support 14 million people. The result was [[overgrazing]], which led to [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref name="lkp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21029-lowkey-projects-keep-horn-of-africa-famine-at-bay.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=online-news |title=Low-key projects keep Horn of Africa famine at bay |author=Debora MacKenzie |accessdate=11 October 2011 |date=10 October 2011 |work=NewScientist |publisher=Reed Business Information }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring human overshoot==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
Globally, we can measure how much the human economy demands against what the biosphere can renew.&lt;ref&gt;Mathis Wackernagel, Niels B. Schulz, Diana Deumling, Alejandro Callejas Linares, Martin Jenkins, Valerie Kapos, Chad Monfreda, Jonathan Loh, Norman Myers Richard Norgaard and Jørgen Rander (May 16, 2002). [http://www.pnas.org/content/99/14/9266.full.pdf+html?sid=1dc62d01-1f10-4ef5-a47c-af92a54dacb2 Tracking the ecological overshoot of the human economy]. Retrieved 2 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; One accounting approach is the [[ecological footprint]]. Footprint accounting measures the demand on [[biocapacity]], i.e., area of biologically productive land and water required to produce the ecological services (including resource regeneration and waste absorption) for a given population. Biocapacity encompasses the biologically productive capacity of all of the planet's surface areas – cropland, grazing land, forest, fresh water etc. Footprint accounts include non-renewable resources like fossil fuels and other minerals in as far as their use puts a demand on biocapacity. Some demands are difficult to measure and are not included in the accounts – hence the results tend to underestimate dependency. Ecological footprint and biocapacity are measured in global hectares (hectares with world average biological productivity). Thus increased productivity would reduce dependency; while increased population or consumption per head would increase it.

The percentage of an area's footprint supported from its renewable resources shows its overall resource dependence within or above its areas' regeneration rate. A percentage over 100 percent indicates local overuse or net dependence on ecosystems elsewhere.  Similarly, the percentage of an area’s population supported from its renewable resources is its sustainable population at current consumption levels with current technology; the remaining percentage is its overshoot population. A country's biocapacity deficit increases as either their population or their per capita consumption grows; and faster if both grow.

All source data is from [http://www.footprintnetwork.org/images/uploads/Ecological_Footprint_Atlas_2010.pdf The Ecological Footprint Atlas 2010], based on 2007 figures, produced by the [[Global Footprint Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footprintnetwork.org Global Footprint Network]. Retrieved 6 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Countries with populations of under one million have been omitted.

[[File:New York's New Solar System2.jpg|thumb|300px|In this 1899 [[Udo Keppler]] cartoon from ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', all of New York City politics revolves around boss [[Richard Croker]].]]

A '''political machine''' is a political group in which an authoritative boss or small group commands the support of a corps of supporters and businesses (usually [[Political campaign|campaign workers]]), who receive rewards for their efforts. The machine's power is based on the ability of the nuggets to [[get out the vote]] for their candidates on election day.

Although these elements are common to most political parties and organizations, they are essential to political machines, which rely on hierarchy and rewards for political power, often enforced by a strong [[Whip (politics)|party whip]] structure. Machines sometimes have a [[political boss]], often rely on [[patronage]], the [[spoils system]], "behind-the-scenes" control, and longstanding political ties within the structure of a [[representative democracy]]. Machines typically are organized on a permanent basis instead of a single election or event. The term may have a pejorative sense referring to corrupt political machines.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = political machine | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/467617/political-machine | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate = December 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "political machine" dates back to the 20th century in the United States, where such organizations have existed in some municipalities and states since the 18th century. Similar machines have been described in [[Latin America]], where the system has been called ''[[:en:clientelism|clientelism]]'' or '''''political clientelism''''' (after the similar [[:Clientela|Clientela]] relationship in the [[Roman Republic]]), especially in rural areas, and also in some African states and other emerging democracies, like postcommunist Eastern European countries. Japan's [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] is often cited as another political machine, maintaining power in [[suburb]]an and [[rural]] areas through its control of farm bureaus and road construction agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The American Journey, Reconstruction to the Present |edition=Student | year = 2005 | publisher = Glencoe/McGraw-Hill | ISBN=0078609801}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the word ''jiban'' (literally "base" or "foundation") is the word used for political machines.&lt;ref name=safire&gt;{{cite book | last = Safire |first= Nicole |title = Safire's Political Dictionary | pages = 391–392 | chapter = "Machine politics" | edition = First | year = 1978 |publisher = Random House}} (although the book existed in an earlier version titled "The New Language of Politics")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Bo0KAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22roman+republic%22+%22political+patronage%22&amp;dq=%22roman+republic%22+%22political+patronage%22&amp;lr=&amp;pgis=1 | title = Editorial Research Reports| publisher = Congressional Quarterly | year = 1973 |volume= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' defines "political machine" as, "in U.S. politics, a party organization, headed by a [[political boss|single boss]] or small autocratic group, that commands enough votes to maintain political and administrative control of a city, county, or state".&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; [[William Safire]], in his ''Safire's Political Dictionary'', defines "machine politics" as "the election of officials and the passage of legislation through the power of an organization created for political action".&lt;ref name=safire/&gt; He notes that the term is generally considered pejorative, often implying corruption.

Hierarchy and discipline are hallmarks of political machines. "It generally means strict organization", according to Safire.&lt;ref name=safire/&gt; Quoting [[Edward J. Flynn|Edward Flynn]], a [[Bronx County]] Democratic leader who ran the borough from 1922 until his death in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last  = Glazer |first = Nathan  |last2=Monyhan |first2=Daniel Patrick |title =Beyond the Melting Pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians and Irish of New York | chapter = The Irish | page = 226 |publisher = The MIT Press |year = 1963 |quote = Ed Flynn ran the Bronx from 1922 until his death in 1953.}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote "[...] the so-called 'independent' voter is foolish to assume that a political machine is run solely on good will, or patronage. For it is not only a machine; it is an army. And in any organization as in any army, there must be discipline."&lt;ref name=safire/&gt;

Political patronage, while often associated with political machines, is not essential to the definition for either Safire or ''Britannica.''&lt;ref name=safire/&gt;

== Function ==
A political machine is a party organization that recruits its members by the use of tangible incentives—money, political jobs—and that is characterized by a high degree of leadership control over member activity.

Political machines started as [[grass roots]] organizations to gain the [[patronage]] needed to win the modern election. Having strong patronage, these "clubs" were the main driving force in gaining and getting out the "straight party vote" in the election districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = James Q. |last = Wilson | authorlink =  James Q. Wilson | title = [[American Government]] | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the United States ==
[[File:Boss tweed.jpg|right|thumb|1869 tobacco label featuring [[William M. Tweed]], 19th-century political boss of New York City]]

In the late 19th century, large cities in the United States—[[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]—were accused of using political machines.&lt;ref name=americans&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Americans: Reconstruction to the 21st Century: California Teacher's Edition |location=Evanston |publisher=McDougall Littell Inc |year=2006 |pages=267–268 |isbn= 978-0618184163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time "cities experienced rapid growth under inefficient government".&lt;ref name=americans/&gt; Each city's machine lived under a hierarchical system with a [[political boss|"boss"]] who held the allegiance of local business leaders, [[elected officials]] and their appointees, and who knew the proverbial buttons to push to get things done. Benefits and problems both resulted from the rule of political machines.&lt;ref name=Blumer&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The American Journal of Sociology |volume=20 |year = 1914–1915|quote=The political machine is in fact an attempt to maintain, inside the formal administrative organization of the city, the control of a primary group. |page=603 |first=Herbert |last=Blumer | jstor = 2763406 | title = The City: Suggestions for the Investigation of Human Behavior in the City Environment | doi = 10.1086/212433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gosnell&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/000271623316900104 |title=The Political Party versus the Political Machine |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |first=Harold F. |last=Gosnell |volume=169 |date=September 1933 |pages=21–28 |quote=When the spoils element is predominant in a political organization, it is called a political machine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This system of political control—known as "[[bossism]]"—emerged particularly in the [[Gilded Age]]. A single powerful figure (the boss) was at the center and was bound together to a complex organization of lesser figures (the political machine) by reciprocity in promoting financial and social self-interest. One of the most infamous of these political machines was [[Tammany Hall]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] machine that played a major role in controlling [[New York City]] and New York politics and helping immigrants, most notably the Irish, rise up in American politics from the 1790s to the 1960s. From 1872, Tammany had an Irish "boss". However, Tammany Hall also served as an engine for [[Graft (politics)|graft]] and political corruption, perhaps most notoriously under [[William M. Tweed|William M. "Boss" Tweed]] in the mid-19th century.

[[Lord Bryce]] describes these political bosses saying:

{{quote|An army led by a council seldom conquers: It must have a commander-in-chief, who settles disputes, decides in emergencies, inspires fear or attachment. The head of the Ring is such a commander. He dispenses places, rewards the loyal, punishes the mutinous, concocts schemes, negotiates treaties. He generally avoids publicity, preferring the substance to the pomp of power, and is all the more dangerous because he sits, like a spider, hidden in the midst of his web. He is a Boss.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | work = Digital History | title = Urban Political Machines | url = http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/us28.cfm | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080821152014/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/us28.cfm | archivedate = 2008-08-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When asked if he was a boss, [[James Pendergast]] said simply,

[[Theodore Roosevelt]], before he became president in 1901, was deeply involved in New York City politics. He explains how the machine worked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The organization of a party in our city is really much like that of an army. There is one great central boss, assisted by some trusted and able lieutenants; these communicate with the different district bosses, whom they alternately bully and assist. The district boss in turn has a number of half-subordinates, half-allies, under him; these latter choose the captains of the election districts, etc., and come into contact with the common heelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Theodore Roosevelt|title=The Works of Theodore Roosevelt: American ideals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pqo3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA132|year=1897|publisher=Collier|pages=132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Voting strategy===
Many machines formed in cities to serve immigrants to the U.S. in the late 19th century who viewed machines as a vehicle for political [[enfranchisement]]. Machine workers helped win elections by turning out large numbers of voters on election day.  It was in the machine's interests to only maintain a minimally winning amount of support. Once they were in the majority and could count on a win, there was less need to recruit new members, as this only meant a thinner spread of the patronage rewards to be spread among the party members.  As such, later-arriving immigrants, such as Jews, Italians, and other immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe between the 1880s and 1910s, saw fewer rewards from the machine system than the well-established Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven P. Erie|title=Rainbow's End: Irish-Americans and the Dilemmas of Urban Machine Politics, 1840-1985|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NxrGXFRlbWgC&amp;pg=PA7|year=1990|publisher=U of California Press|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the machines' staunchest opponents were members of the middle class, who were shocked at the malfeasance and did not need the financial help.&lt;ref&gt;Ari A. Hoogenboom, "An Analysis of Civil Service Reformers". ''Historian'' 23#1 (1960): 54–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The corruption of [[urban politics in the United States]] was denounced by private citizens. They achieved national and state civil-service reform and worked to replace local patronage systems with [[civil service]]. By [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s time, the [[Progressive Era]] mobilized millions of private citizens to vote against the machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ruhil | first1 = Anirudh V.S. | year = 2003 | title = Urban Armageddon or politics as usual?

In the 1930s, [[James A. Farley]] was the chief dispenser of the Democratic Party's patronage system through the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]] and the [[Works Progress Administration]] which eventually nationalized many of the job benefits machines provided. The [[New Deal]] allowed machines to recruit for the WPA and [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], making Farley's machine the most powerful. All patronage was screened through Farley, including presidential appointments. The [[New Deal]] machine fell apart after he left the administration over the third term in 1940. Those agencies were abolished in 1943 and the machines suddenly lost much of their patronage. The formerly poor immigrants who had benefited under Farley's national machine had become assimilated and prosperous and no longer needed the informal or extralegal aides provided by machines.&lt;ref name=sv;av /&gt; In the 1940s most of the big city machines collapsed, with the exception of Chicago.&lt;ref name=sv;av&gt;{{citation | title = Political Machines | url = http://autocww.colorado.edu/~toldy2/E64ContentFiles/PoliticsAndGovernment/PoliticalMachines.htm | publisher = University of Colorado, Boulder}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local political machine in [[Tennessee]] was forcibly removed in what was known as the [[Battle of Athens (1946)|1946 Battle of Athens]].

Smaller communities such as [[Parma, Ohio]], in the post–Cold War Era under Prosecutor Bill Mason's "Good Old Boys" and especially communities in the Deep South, where small-town machine politics are relatively common, also feature what might be classified as political machines, although these organizations do not have the power and influence of the larger boss networks listed in this article.

==Evaluation==
The phrase is considered derogatory "because it suggests that the interest of the organization are placed before those of the general public", according to Safire. Machines are criticized as undemocratic and inevitably encouraging corruption.&lt;ref name=safire/&gt;

Since the 1960s, some historians have reevaluated political machines, considering them corrupt but efficient. Machines were undemocratic but responsive. They were also able to contain the spending demands of special interests. In ''Mayors and Money'', a comparison of municipal government in Chicago and New York, [[Ester R. Fuchs]] credited the [[Cook County Democratic Organization]] with giving Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] the political power to deny [[labor union]] contracts that the city could not afford and to make the state government assume burdensome costs like [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and courts. Describing New York, Fuchs wrote, "New York got reform, but it never got good government." At the same time, as Dennis R. Judd and Todd Swanstrom suggest in ''City Politics'' that this view accompanied the common belief that there were no viable alternatives. They go on to point out that this is a falsehood, since there are certainly examples of reform oriented, anti-machine leaders during this time.

In his mid-2016 article "How American Politics Went Insane" in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Jonathan Rauch]] argued that the political machines of the past had flaws but provided better governance than the alternatives. He wrote that political machines created positive incentives for politicians to work together and compromise – as opposed to pursuing "naked self-interest" the whole time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/07/how-american-politics-went-insane/485570/|title=How American Politics Went Insane|author=[[Jonathan Rauch]]|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|date=June 2016|accessdate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Septenary''' in [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s teachings refers to the seven principles of [[Human|man]].  In ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]''&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Blavatsky, ''The Key to Theosophy'' pp.&amp;nbsp;90–93&lt;/ref&gt; she presents a synthesis of Eastern ([[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Samkhya]]) and Western ([[Platonism]], 19th century [[Occultism]]) ideas, according to which human nature consists of seven principles. These are:

* ''Atma''  - Spirit or Self - one with The Absolute as Its Radiation.
* ''Buddhi'' - Spiritual Soul - vehicle of pure universal spirit.
* [[Manas (early Buddhism)|''Manas'']] - consisting of ''Higher Manas'', the spiritual, inner, or higher Ego; and ''Lower Manas'', the ordinary [[Mental body|mind]].
* [[Kamarupa (Indian philosophy and Theosophy)|''Kamarupa'']] - the "desire body", seat of animal desires and passions.
* ''[[Prana]]'' - the vital principle.
* [[Subtle body|''Linga Sharira'']] - the double, or [[astral body]].
* ''Sthula Sharira'' - the [[physical body]].

Each of these principles are embodied as such:
* The first body is called ''sthula-sarira'' ([[Sanskrit]], from ''sthula'' meaning coarse, gross, not refined, heavy, bulky, fat in the sense of bigness, conditioned and differentiated matter + ''sarira'' to moulder, waste away). A gross body, impermanent because of its wholly compound character. The physical body is usually considered as the lowest substance-principle. The physical form is the result of the harmonious co-working on the physical plane of forces and faculties streaming through their astral vehicle or linga-sarira, the pattern or model of the physical body.
* The second body is called ''Linga-Sarira'', (Sanskrit, from ''linga'' meaning characteristic mark, model, pattern + ''sarira'', from the verbal root sri to moulder, waste away). A pattern or model that is impermanent; the model-body or [[astral body]], only slightly more ethereal than the physical body. It is the astral model around which the physical body is built, and from which the physical body flows or develops as growth proceeds.
* The third body is [[prana]] (Sanskrit, from ''pra'' before + the verbal root ''an'' to breathe, to live). In Theosophy, the breath of life. This life or prana works on, in, and around us, pulsating unceasingly during the term of physical existence. Prana is "the radiating force or Energy of Atma – as the Universal Life and the One Self – its lower or rather (in its effects) more physical, because manifesting, aspect. Prana or Life permeates the whole being of the objective Universe; and is called a 'principle' only because it is an indispensable factor and the [[deus ex machina]] of the living man."
* The fourth principle is [[kāma]] (Sanskrit, from the verbal root ''kam'' meaning to desire). Desire; the desire principle is the driving, impelling force. Born from the interaction of atman, buddhi, and manas, kama per se is a colourless force, good or bad according to the way the mind and soul use it. It is the seat of the living electrical impulses, desires, and aspirations, considered in their energetic aspect.
* The fifth principle is [[mana]]s (Sanskrit, from the verbal root ''man'' meaning to think). The seat of mentation and egoic consciousness; in humanity Manas is the human person, the reincarnating ego, immortal in essence, enduring in its higher aspects through the entire manvantara. When embodied, manas is dual, gravitating toward buddhi in its higher aspects and in its lower aspects toward kama. The first is intuitive mind, the second the animal, ratiocinative consciousness, the lower mentality and passions of the personality.
* The sixth principle or vehicle is [[Buddhi]] (Sanskrit, from the verbal root ''budh'' to awaken, enlighten, know). The vehicle of pure, universal spirit, hence an inseparable garment or vehicle of atman, which is, in its essence, of the highest plane of akasa or alaya. In man buddhi is the spiritual soul, the faculty of discriminating, the channel through which streams divine inspiration from the atman to the ego, and therefore that faculty which enables us to discern between good and evil: spiritual conscience. The qualities of the buddhic principle when awakened are higher judgment, instant understanding, discrimination, intuition, love that has no bounds, and consequent universal forgiveness.
* The seventh is called [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (Sanskrit). Self; pure consciousness, that cosmic self which is the same in every dweller on this globe and on every one of the planetary or stellar bodies in space. It is the feeling and knowledge of "I am," pure cognition, the abstract idea of self. It does not differ at all throughout the cosmos except in degree of self-recognition. It may also be considered as the First Logos in the human microcosm. During incarnation the lowest aspects of atman take on attributes, because it is linked with buddhi, as the buddhi is linked with manas, as the manas is linked with kama, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/etg-hp.htm Encyclopedic Theosophic Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite using [[Sanskrit]] terminology, many of these concepts are expressed differently from their Indian counterparts.  The [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or Self in monistic [[Vedanta]] for example is considered the Universal Self that is the same as, and not just a "ray" of, the Absolute or [[Brahman]].

These seven principles can be grouped into a threefold division of ''Monad'' (transcendent Spirit, consisting of Atma and Buddhi), ''Ego'' (the higher immortal spiritual Personality, made up of the Higher Manas only) and ''Lower Quaternity'' (the mortal personality, the Lower Manas and the remaining principles).  In this, the Lower Manas is a transitional principle, the [[soul]] so to speak, which can choose to join either with the Kama (Desire) principle to form the "Kama-Manas", which becomes an "elementary" or "astral" spirit after death (equivalent perhaps to the ''[[preta]]'' or hungry ghost of [[Buddhism]]), or link with the higher or Buddhi principle to form a higher spiritual consciousness, the "Buddhi-Manas".

Theosophists believe that the most material of the vestures of the soul are interpenetrated by the particles of the more subtle vesture. The Sthula Sarira or gross physical body is mostly space at its atomic level, as all matter is known to be. The interstitial space is inhabited by the subtler particles of the [[Astral body]] or Linga sarira, and so on for the other more energy-like envelopes of the Soul. Because of the interpenetration of each sheath the so-called ''inner person'' is a fluid and unbroken continuity, although varying in density/flexibility and energy. Therefore, it is progressively more susceptible to its true spiritual nature as it is progressively less encumbered by material boundaries; the image of a suspension or [[colloid]] in chemistry is a similar perspective. Matter is postulated to be the physical counterpart of consciousness (ultimately our aspect being pure consciousness); the interpenetration of sheaths allows for consciousness to interpenetrate man's nature and is a Theosophical explanation of sensory experience.

As well as seven subtle bodies, there are also seven [[Plane (cosmology)|Cosmic planes]] of existence.  However, in Blavatsky's teachings, the Planes and Principles don't match up (post-Blavatskian re-interpreters like [[C.W. Leadbeater]] reinterpreted the seven principles so they equate with the seven planes; this interpretation since became standard everywhere but original or orthodox Blavatskyian Theosophy).

While undergoing some changes and modifications in the hands of later esotericists such as C.W. Leadbeater, [[Rudolf Steiner]], and [[Alice Bailey]], Blavatsky's description of the seven [[Subtle body|bodies or principles]] remained a central part of western [[esotericism|esoteric]] and [[New Age]] thinking ever since.

In [[sociology]], '''socialization''' is the process of [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalizing]] the [[Norm (social)|norm]]s and [[Ideology|ideologies]] of [[society]]. Socialization encompasses both learning and teaching and is thus "the means by which social and [[Culture|cultural]] continuity are attained".&lt;ref name=Clausen&gt;Clausen, John A. (ed.)

Socialization may lead to desirable outcomes—sometimes labeled "[[Morality|moral]]"—as regards the society where it occurs. Individual views are influenced by the society's [[consensus]] and usually tend toward what that society finds acceptable or "normal".

== Stages of moral development ==
{{Main|Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development}}
[[Lawrence Kohlberg]] studied moral reasoning and developed a theory of how individuals reason situations as right from wrong. The first stage is the pre-conventional stage, where a person (typically children) experience the world in terms of pain and pleasure, with their moral decisions solely reflecting this experience. Second, the conventional stage (typical for adolescents and adults) is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong, even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Finally, the post-conventional stage (more rarely achieved) occurs if a person moves beyond society's norms to consider abstract ethical principles when making moral decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, Gerber 2010 108&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages of psychosocial development ==
{{Main|Erikson's stages of psychosocial development}}
[[Erik Erikson|Erik H. Erikson]] (1902–1994) explained the challenges throughout the life course. The first stage in the life course is infancy, where babies learn trust and mistrust. The second stage is toddlerhood where children around the age of two struggle with the challenge of autonomy versus doubt. In stage three, preschool, children struggle to understand the difference between initiative and guilt. Stage four, pre-adolescence, children learn about industriousness and inferiority. In the fifth stage called adolescence, teenagers experience the challenge of gaining identity versus confusion. The sixth stage, young adulthood, is when young people gain insight to life when dealing with the challenge of intimacy and isolation. In stage seven, or middle adulthood, people experience the challenge of trying to make a difference (versus self-absorption). In the final stage, stage eight or old age, people are still learning about the challenge of integrity and despair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology 7th Canadian Ed|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, Ontario|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behaviorism ==
{{See also|Reciprocal socialization}}
[[George Herbert Mead]] (1863–1931) developed a theory of social [[behaviorism]] to explain how social experience develops an individual's self-concept. Mead's central concept is the self: It is composed of self-awareness and [[self-image]]. Mead claimed that the self is not there at birth, rather, it is developed with social experience. Since social experience is the exchange of symbols, people tend to find meaning in every action. Seeking meaning leads us to imagine the intention of others. Understanding intention requires imagining the situation from the others' point of view. In effect, others are a mirror in which we can see ourselves.  Charles Horton Cooley (1902-1983) coined the term [[looking glass self]], which means self-image based on how we think others see us. According to Mead the key to developing the self is learning to take the role of the other. With limited social experience, infants can only develop a sense of identity through imitation. Gradually children learn to take the roles of several others. The final stage is the generalized other, which refers to widespread cultural norms and values we use as a reference for evaluating others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology 7th Canadian Ed|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, Ontario|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contradictory evidence to behaviorism===
Behaviorism makes claims that when infants are born they lack social experience or self. The social pre-wiring hypothesis, on the other hand, shows proof through a scientific study that social behavior is partly inherited and can influence infants and also even influence foetuses. Wired to be social means that infants are not taught that they are social beings, but they are born as prepared social beings.

'''The social pre-wiring hypothesis''' refers to the [[ontogeny]] of [[social relation|social interaction]]. Also informally referred to as, "wired to be social". The theory questions whether there is a propensity to [[social actions|socially oriented action]] already present ''before'' birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique [[genetics|genetic]] wiring to be social.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wired to Be Social: The Ontogeny of Human Interaction|date=7 October 2010|publisher=|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=5|issue=10|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013199|pmid=20949058|pmc=2951360|author=Umberto Castiello|displayauthors=etal|page=e13199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for social interaction. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or [[social construction]]. Rather, newborns most likely [[heredity|inherit]] to some extent [[social behavior]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]] through genetics.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

The social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, "The central advance of this study is the demonstration that 'social actions' are already performed in the second trimester of [[gestational age|gestation]]. Starting from the 14th week of gestation twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of social behavior: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions."&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

== Primary socialization ==
{{Main article|Primary socialisation}}
Primary socialization for a child is very important because it sets the ground work for all future socialization. Primary Socialization occurs when a [[child]] learns the attitudes, values, and actions appropriate to individuals as members of a particular culture. It is mainly influenced by the immediate family and friends.  For example, if a child saw his/her mother expressing a [[discriminatory]] opinion about a minority group, then that child may think this behavior is acceptable and could continue to have this opinion about minority groups.

=== Secondary socialization ===
Secondary socialization refers to the process of learning what is the appropriate behavior as a member of a smaller group within the larger society. Basically, it is the behavioral patterns reinforced by socializing agents of society. Secondary socialization takes place outside the home.  It is where children and adults learn how to act in a way that is appropriate for the situations they are in.&lt;ref name="newportsouthwales.net"&gt;http://www.newportsouthwales.net/bassaleg/departments/Social%20Sciences/Revision/Secondary_Socialisation.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; Schools require very different behavior from the home, and Children must act according to new rules. New teachers have to act in a way that is different from pupils and learn the new rules from people around them.&lt;ref name="newportsouthwales.net" /&gt; Secondary Socialization is usually associated with teenagers and adults, and involves smaller changes than those occurring in primary socialization. Such examples of Secondary Socialization are entering a new profession or relocating to a new environment or society.

== Anticipatory socialization ==
{{Main|Anticipatory socialization}}
Anticipatory socialization refers to the processes of socialization in which a person "rehearses" for future positions, occupations, and social relationships.  For example, a couple might move in together before getting married in order to try out, or anticipate, what living together will be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/sociology/socialization/|title=SparkNotes: Socialization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research by Kenneth J. Levine and Cynthia A. Hoffner suggests that parents are the main source of anticipatory socialization in regards to jobs and careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levine | first1 = K. J. | last2 = Hoffner | first2 = C. A. | year = 2006 | title = Adolescents' conceptions of work: What is learned from different sources during anticipatory socialization? | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Research | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 647–669 | doi = 10.1177/0743558406293963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resocialization ==
{{Main|Resocialization}}
Resocialization refers to the process of discarding former behavior patterns and reflexes, accepting new ones as part of a transition in one's life. This occurs throughout the human life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;(Schaefer &amp; Lamm, 1992: 113)&lt;/ref&gt; Resocialization can be an intense experience, with the individual experiencing a sharp break with his or her past, as well as a need to learn and be exposed to radically different norms and values.  One common example involves resocialization through a total institution, or "a setting in which people are isolated from the rest of society and manipulated by an administrative staff".  Resocialization via total institutions involves a two step process: 1) the staff work to root out a new inmate's individual identity &amp; 2) the staff attempt to create for the inmate a new identity.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, John J. "Sociology: 7th Canadian Edition". (Toronto: Pearson, 2011), 120-121&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of this are the experience of a young man or woman leaving home to join the military, or a religious convert internalizing the beliefs and rituals of a new faith. An extreme example would be the process by which a [[transsexual]] learns to function socially in a dramatically altered gender role.

== Organizational socialization ==
{{Main|Onboarding}}
[[File:Organizationalsocializationmodel.jpg|thumb|Organizational Socialization Chart]]
Organizational socialization is the process whereby an employee learns the knowledge and skills necessary to assume his or her organizational role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:his:diva-4281|title=INTRODUKTION – INTEGRATION? : Om introduktionsprogrammets betydelse för integration av nyanställda|first=Alvenfors,|last=Adam|date=1 January 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As newcomers become socialized, they learn about the organization and its history, values, jargon, culture, and procedures. This acquired knowledge about new employees' future work environment affects the way they are able to apply their skills and abilities to their jobs. How actively engaged the employees are in pursuing knowledge affects their socialization process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kammeyer-Mueller | first1 = J. D. | last2 = Wanberg | first2 = C.

Socialization functions as a control system in that newcomers learn to internalize and obey organizational values and practices.

== Group socialization ==
{{See also|Group dynamics}}
[[File:Duck Duck Goose.jpg|thumb|Group Socialization.]]
Group socialization is the theory that an individual's peer groups, rather than parental figures, are the primary influence of [[personality]] and behavior in adulthood.&lt;ref name="J Harris"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = J.

Hetherington (Vol. Ed.), Handbook of Child Psychology: Vol. 4. Socialization, personality, and social development (4th ed., pp. 1-101). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents spend more time with peers than with parents.  Therefore, peer groups have stronger correlations with personality development than parental figures do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bester | first1 = G | year = 2007 | title = Personality development of the adolescent: peer group versus parents | url = | journal = South African Journal of Education | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 177–190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, twin brothers, whose genetic makeup are identical, will differ in personality because they have different groups of friends, not necessarily because their parents raised them differently. Behavioral genetics suggest that up to fifty percent of the variance in adult personality is due to genetic differences.&lt;ref&gt;McGue, M., Bouchard, T. J. Jr., Iacono, W. G. &amp; Lykken, D. T.

Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;  The environment in which a child is raised accounts for only approximately ten percent in the variance of an adult's personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plomin | first1 = R. | last2 = Daniels | first2 = D. | year = 1987 | title = Why are children in the same family so different from one another? | doi = 10.1017/s0140525x00055941 | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 1–16 | pmc = 3147063 }} Reprinted in {{cite journal | pmc = 3147063 | pmid=21807642 | doi=10.1093/ije/dyq148 | volume=40 | title=Why are children in the same family so different from one another? | date=June 2011 | journal=Int J Epidemiol | pages=563–82 | last1 = Plomin | first1 = R | last2 = Daniels | first2 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt; As much as twenty percent of the variance is due to measurement error.&lt;ref&gt;Plomin, R. (1990). Nature and nurture: An introduction to human behavioral genetics. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that only a very small part of an adult's personality is influenced by factors parents control (i.e. the home environment). Harris claims that while it's true that siblings don't have identical experiences in the home environment (making it difficult to associate a definite figure to the variance of personality due to home environments), the variance found by current methods is so low that researchers should look elsewhere to try to account for the remaining variance.&lt;ref name="J Harris"/&gt; Harris also states that developing long-term personality characteristics away from the home environment would be evolutionarily beneficial because future success is more likely to depend on interactions with peers than interactions with parents and siblings.  Also, because of already existing genetic similarities with parents, developing personalities outside of childhood home environments would further diversify individuals, increasing their evolutionary success.&lt;ref name="J Harris"/&gt;

Entering high school is a crucial moment in many adolescent's lifespan involving the branching off from the restraints of their parents. When dealing with new life challenges, adolescents take comfort in discussing these issues within their peer groups instead of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grier|first=Peter|title=The Heart Of A High School: Peers As Collective Parent|journal=Christian Monitor News Science|date=24 April 2000|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Grier, staff writer of the Christian Science Monitor describes this occurrence as,"Call it the benign side of peer pressure. Today's high-schoolers operate in groups that play the role of nag and nanny-in ways that are both beneficial and isolating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grier|first=Peter|title=The Heart Of A High School:Peers As Collective Parent|journal=Christian Science Monitor News Service|date=24 April 2000|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stages ===

Individuals and groups change their evaluations and commitments to each other over time. There is a predictable sequence of stages that occur in order for an individual to transition through a group; investigation, socialization, maintenance, resocialization, and remembrance. During each stage, the individual and the group evaluate each other which leads to an increase or decrease in commitment to socialization. This socialization pushes the individual from prospective, new, full, marginal, and ex member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreland|first1=Richard L.|last2=Levine|first2=John M.|title=Socialization in Small Groups: Temporal Changes in Individual-Group Relations|journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1982|volume=15|pages=137–192|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60297-X|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S006526010860297X|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage 1: Investigation'''
This stage is marked by a cautious search for information. The individual compares groups in order to determine which one will fulfill their needs (''reconnaissance''), while the group estimates the value of the potential member (''recruitment''). The end of this stage is marked by entry to the group, whereby the group asks the individual to join and they accept the offer.

'''Stage 2: Socialization'''
Now that the individual has moved from prospective member to new member, they must accept the group's culture. At this stage, the individual accepts the group's norms, values, and perspectives (''assimilation''), and the group adapts to fit the new member's needs (''accommodation''). The acceptance transition point is then reached and the individual becomes a full member. However, this transition can be delayed if the individual or the group reacts negatively. For example, the individual may react cautiously or misinterpret other members' reactions if they believe that they will be treated differently as a new comer.

'''Stage 3: Maintenance''' 
During this stage, the individual and the group negotiate what contribution is expected of members (role negotiation). While many members remain in this stage until the end of their membership,  some individuals are not satisfied with their role in the group or fail to meet the group's expectations (''divergence'').

'''Stage 4: Resocialization'''
If the divergence point is reached, the former full member takes on the role of a marginal member and must be resocialized.  There are two possible outcomes of resocialization: differences are resolved and the individual becomes a full member again (''convergence''), or the group expels the individual or the individual decides to leave (''exit'').

'''Stage 5: Remembrance''' 
In this stage, former members reminisce about their memories of the group, and make sense of their recent departure. If the group reaches a consensus on their reasons for departure, conclusions about the overall experience of the group become part of the group's ''tradition''.

== Gender socialization ==
{{See also|Sociology of gender#Gender and socialization|Social construction of gender|Role theory}}
Henslin (1999:76) contends that "an important part of socialization is the learning of culturally defined [[gender roles]]." Gender socialization refers to the learning of behavior and attitudes considered appropriate for a given sex. Boys learn to be boys and girls learn to be girls. This "learning" happens by way of many different agents of socialization. The behaviour that is seen to be appropriate for each gender is largely determined by societal, cultural and economic values in a given society. Gender socialization can therefore vary considerably among societies with different values. The family is certainly important in reinforcing [[gender roles]], but so are groups including friends, peers, school, work and the mass media. Gender roles are reinforced through "countless subtle and not so subtle ways" (1999:76). In peer group activities, stereotypic gender roles may also be rejected, renegotiated or artfully exploited for a variety of purposes.&lt;ref name="Cromdal2011"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cromdal |first=Jakob |authorlink=Jakob Cromdal |year=2011 |chapter=Gender as a practical concern in children's management of play participation |editor=S. A. Speer and E. Stokoe |title=Conversation and Gender |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=296–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carol Gilligan]] compared the moral development of girls and boys in her theory of gender and moral development. She claimed (1982, 1990) that boys have a justice perspective meaning that they rely on formal rules to define right and wrong. Girls, on the other hand, have a care and responsibility perspective where personal relationships are considered when judging a situation. Gilligan also studied the effect of gender on self-esteem. She claimed that society's socialization of females is the reason why girls' self-esteem diminishes as they grow older. Girls struggle to regain their personal strength when moving through adolescence as they have fewer female teachers and most authority figures are men.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, Gerber, John, Linda (2010). Sociology 7th Canadian Ed. Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Canada Inc.. pp.109&lt;/ref&gt;

As parents are present in a child's life from the beginning, their influence in a child's early socialization is very important, especially in regards to gender roles. Sociologists have identified four ways in which parents socialize gender roles in their children: Shaping gender related attributes through toys and activities, differing their interaction with children based on the sex of the child, serving as primary gender models, and communicating gender ideals and expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Epstein | first1 = Marina | last2 = Ward | first2 = Monique L | year = 2011 | title = Exploring parent-adolescent communication about gender: Results from adolescent and emerging adult samples | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 108–118 | doi=10.1007/s11199-011-9975-7| pmc = 3122487 | pmid=21712963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist of gender R.W. Connell contends that socialization theory is "inadequate" for explaining gender, because it presumes a largely consensual process except for a few "deviants," when really most children revolt against pressures to be conventionally gendered; because it cannot explain contradictory "scripts" that come from different socialization agents in the same society, and because it does not account for conflict between the different levels of an individual's gender (and general) identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Connell|first1=R.W.|title=Gender and power: society, the person and sexual politics|date=1987|publisher=Stanford Univ.

== Racial socialization ==
Racial socialization has been defined as "the developmental processes by which children acquire the behaviors, perceptions, values, and attitudes of an ethnic group, and come to see themselves and others as members of the group".&lt;ref&gt;Rotherman, M., &amp; Phinney, J. (1987). Introduction: Definitions and perspectives in the study of children's ethnic socialization. In J. Phinney &amp; M. Rotherman (Eds.), Children's ethnic socialization: Pluralism and development (pp. 10-28). Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The existing literature conceptualizes racial socialization as having multiple dimensions.  Researchers have identified five dimensions that commonly appear in the racial socialization literature: cultural socialization, preparation for bias, promotion of mistrust, egalitarianism, and other.&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = D. | last2 = Rodriguez | first2 = J. | last3 = Smith | first3 = E. | last4 = Johnson | first4 = D. | last5 = Stevenson | first5 = H. | last6 = Spicer | first6 = P. | year = 2006 | title = Parents' ethnic-racial socialization practices: A review of research and directions for future study | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = 5| pages = 747–770 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.42.5.747 | pmid=16953684}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural socialization refers to parenting practices that teach children about their racial history or heritage and is sometimes referred to as pride development. Preparation for bias refers to parenting practices focused on preparing children to be aware of, and cope with, discrimination. Promotion of mistrust refers to the parenting practices of socializing children to be wary of people from other races. Egalitarianism refers to socializing children with the belief that all people are equal and should be treated with a common humanity.&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt;

== Oppression socialization ==
Oppression socialization refers to the process by which "individuals develop understandings of power and political structure, particularly as these inform perceptions of identity, power, and opportunity relative to gender, racialized group membership, and sexuality."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political sociology: Oppression, resistance, and the state.|last=Glasberg|first=Davita Silfen|last2=Shannon|first2=Deric|publisher=Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press.|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action is a form of [[political socialization]] in its relation to power and the persistent compliance of the disadvantaged with their oppression using limited "overt coercion."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Language socialization==
Based on comparative research in different societies, focusing on the role of language in child development, [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] [[Elinor Ochs]] and [[Bambi Schieffelin]] have developed the theory of language socialization.&lt;ref name="language"&gt;Ochs, Elinor. 1988. ''Culture and language development: Language acquisition and language socialization in a Samoan village''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. --- Ochs, Elinor, and Bambi Schieffelin. 1984. Language Acquisition and Socialization: Three Developmental Stories and Their Implications. In ''Culture Theory: Essays on Mind, Self, and Emotion''. R. Shweder and R.A. LeVine, eds. Pp. 276-320. New York: Cambridge University. --- Schieffelin, Bambi B. 1990. ''The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
They discovered that the processes of [[enculturation]] and socialization do not occur apart from the process of [[language acquisition]], but that children acquire language and culture together in what amounts to an integrated process. Members of all societies socialize children both ''to'' and ''through'' the use of language; acquiring competence in a language, the novice is by the same token socialized into the categories and norms of the culture, while the culture, in turn, provides the norms of the use of language.

== Planned socialization ==
Planned socialization occurs when other people take actions designed to teach or train others. This type of socialization can take on many forms and can occur at any point from infancy onward.&lt;ref name="soc.ucsb.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/faculty/baldwin/classes/soc142/scznDEF.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025103616/http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/faculty/baldwin/classes/soc142/scznDEF.html |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural socialization ==
Natural socialization occurs when infants and youngsters explore, play and discover the social world around them. Natural socialization is easily seen when looking at the young of almost any mammalian species (and some birds). Planned socialization is mostly a human phenomenon; all through history, people have been making plans for teaching or training others. Both natural and planned socialization can have good and bad qualities: it is useful to learn the best features of both natural and planned socialization in order to incorporate them into life in a meaningful way.&lt;ref name="soc.ucsb.edu" /&gt;

== Positive socialization ==
Positive socialization is the type of social learning that is based on pleasurable and exciting experiences. We tend to like the people who fill our social learning processes with positive motivation, loving care, and rewarding opportunities. Positive socialization occurs when desirable behaviours are reinforced with a reward, encouraging the individual to continue exhibiting similar behaviours in the future.&lt;ref name="soc.ucsb.edu" /&gt;

== Negative socialization ==
Negative socialization occurs when others use punishment, harsh criticisms or anger to try to "teach us a lesson;" and often we come to dislike both negative socialization and the people who impose it on us.&lt;ref name="soc.ucsb.edu" /&gt;  There are all types of mixes of positive and negative socialization, and the more positive social learning experiences we have, the happier we tend to be—especially if we are able to learn useful information that helps us cope well with the challenges of life. A high ratio of negative to positive socialization can make a person unhappy, leading to defeated or pessimistic feelings about life.&lt;ref name="soc.ucsb.edu" /&gt;

==Institutions==
{{Main article|Institutions}}
In the social sciences, institutions are the [[social structure|structures]] and [[social mechanism|mechanisms]] of [[social order]] and [[cooperation]] governing the [[behavior]] of [[individual]]s within a given human collectivity. Institutions are identified with a [[social purpose]] and permanence, transcending individual [[human]] lives and intentions, and with the making and enforcing of rules governing cooperative human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/social-institutions/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Seumas|last=Miller|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2014|publisher=|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productive processing of reality ==
From the late 1980s, sociological and psychological theories have been connected with the term socialization. One example of this connection is the theory of [[Klaus Hurrelmann]]. In his book ''"Social Structure and Personality Development"'' (Hurrelmann 1989/2009), he develops the model of '''productive processing of reality'''. The core idea is that socialization refers to an individual's [[personality development]]. It is the result of the productive processing of interior and exterior realities. Bodily and mental qualities and traits constitute a person's inner reality; the circumstances of the social and physical environment embody the external reality. Reality processing is productive because human beings actively grapple with their lives and attempt to cope with the attendant developmental tasks. The success of such a process depends on the personal and social resources available. Incorporated within all developmental tasks is the necessity to reconcile personal individuation and social integration and so secure the "I-dentity". (Hurrelmann1989/2009: 42)

== Oversocialization ==
{{See also|Political socialization}}
The problem of order or Hobbesian problem questions the existence of [[social order]]s and asks if it is possible to oppose them. [[Émile Durkheim]] viewed society as an external force controlling individuals through the imposition of sanctions and codes of law. However, constraints and sanctions also arise internally as feelings of guilt or anxiety. If [[conformity]] as an expression of the [[Belongingness|need for belonging]], the process of socialization is not necessarily universal. Behavior may not be influenced by society at all, but instead be [[Biological determinism|determined biologically]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wrong|first1=Dennis H.|title=The Oversocialized Conception of Man in Modern Sociology|journal=American Sociological Review|date=1 January 1961|volume=26|issue=2|pages=183–193|doi=10.2307/2089854|jstor=2089854}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavioral sciences during the second half of the twentieth century were dominated by two contrasting models of human political behavior, [[homo economicus]] and [[cultural hegemony]], collectively termed the [[standard social science model]]. The fields of [[sociobiology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]] developed in response notions such as [[dominance hierarchies]], [[cultural group selection]], and [[dual inheritance theory]]. Behavior is the result of a complex interaction between [[nature and nurture]], or [[gene]]s and [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gintis|first1=Herbert|last2=van Schaik|first2=Carel|last3=Boehm|first3=Christopher|title=Zoon Politikon: The Evolutionary Origins of Human Political Systems|journal=Current Anthropology|date=June 2015|volume=56|issue=3|pages=327–353|doi=10.1086/681217}}&lt;/ref&gt; A focus on innate behavior at the expense of learning is termed undersocialization, while attributing behavior to learning when it is the result of evolution is termed oversocialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Searle|first1=Jason|title=Traditional Economics and the Fiduciary Illusion: A Socio- Legal Understanding of Corporate Governance|journal=Brigham Young University Prelaw Review|date=1 January 2015|volume=29|issue=1|url=http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/byuplr/vol29/iss1/8|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sock''' and '''buskin''' are two ancient symbols of [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]]. In Greek theatre, actors in tragic roles wore a boot called a [[buskin]] (Latin ''cothurnus'') that elevated them above the other actors. The actors with comedic roles only wore a thin soled shoe called a [[Soccus|sock]] (Latin ''soccus'').

[[Melpomene]], the muse of tragedy, is often depicted holding the tragic mask and wearing buskins. [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]], the muse of comedy, is similarly associated with the mask of comedy and comic’s socks. Some people refer to the masks themselves as "Sock and Buskin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Mackay|title=A Glossary of Obscure Words and Phrases in the Writings of Shakspeare and His Contemporaries Traced Etymologically to the Ancient Language of the British People as Spoken Before the Irruption of the Danes and Saxons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKXTAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA48|year=1887|publisher=S.

'''Speculative reason''', sometimes called '''theoretical reason''' or '''pure reason''', is theoretical (or [[logic]]al, [[deductive reasoning|deductive]]) thought, as opposed to practical (active, willing) thought. The distinction between the two goes at least as far back as the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]], such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], who distinguished between [[theory]] (''theoria,'' or a wide, [[bird's eye view]] of a topic, or clear vision of its structure) and practice (''praxis''), as well as ''[[techne]]''.

Speculative reason is contemplative, detached, and certain, whereas [[practical reason]] is engaged, involved, active, and dependent upon the specifics of the situation. Speculative reason provides the universal, necessary principles of [[logic]], such as the principle of [[non-contradiction]], which must apply everywhere, regardless of the specifics of the situation. 

On the other hand, [[practical reason]] is the power of the mind engaged in deciding what to do. It is also referred to as [[moral reason]], because it involves action, decision, and particulars. Though many other thinkers have erected systems based on the distinction, two important later thinkers who have done so are [[Aquinas]] (who follows [[Aristotle]] in many respects) and [[Immanuel Kant]].

'''''The Nomadic Project'''''  is a [[conceptual art]] project, designed by visual artist, Kristin Abraham and musician, Alfonso Llamas. From November 13, 2005 to December 21, 2006 the artists traveled to all 50 states in the United States, the goal being to connect the country through art by experiencing as much in each state as possible in one week. In that time, Abraham painted an impression based on the land or her experiences, or a combination of both. Llamas communicated his experiences by composing music with an acoustic guitar and laptop. As the artists traveled, each state's painting was left in a neighboring state, at an art gallery, art center, or museum, while music was posted on the project's website. This process connected the country, by bringing inspiration from one state and leaving it in the next. By December 21, 2006 the artists had visited and placed a painting in all fifty states.

Llamas and Abraham spent about a week in each state, with two weeks being set aside for Texas, California, and [[Alaska]]. They traveled in a [[Honda Element]] purchased specifically for the project. Llamas modified the vehicle with a storage unit, a refrigerator and a bed. They camped in [[National Parks]], [[United States National Forest|National Forests]], and parking lots, spending a day or two in a hotel room each week for painting and creating.

== Development ==

Llamas and Abraham met in [[Ft. Myers, Florida]] in early 2002, when Llamas became guitar player for the indie rock band, The Penny Arcade, which at the time, Abraham's sister was lead singer for the band. The two formed a friendship based on their love of music and art and eventually started dating. At this time the couple developed the initial concept for what would become ''The Nomadic Project''. The couple married in November 2003. Originally the project was designed as a personal journey combining their creative passions and desire to travel. The project took a new direction as the couple saw the impact that the [[2004 Elections]] and [[Iraq War]] were having on the country. Llamas and Abraham have said it was then they decided to have a painting for each state and to connect the country through art. Llamas and Abraham funded the project solely through the sale of artwork and personal savings. The couple has credited husband and wife artists, [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]] as inspiration for funding their project entirely themselves. In November 2005, three years after they first dreamed of ''The Nomadic Project'', they sold their home and possessions and set out from [[Ft. Myers, Florida]].

== Purpose ==

While traveling cross the country ''The Nomadic Project'' was greeted with mixed reactions. Most people applauded the duo's creativity and courage in such an ambitious undertaking, while some dismissed it as two unknown artists involved in an oddball project. For the most part, criticism was minimal{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and the project received extensive media coverage throughout the country. On December 20, 2006 in a radio interview with [[WORT]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], the couple spoke of their desire to not only share their experiences with others, but to also inspire people to get out and see the country. They went further to say they felt the country is divided between religious, political, and racial lines, with the [[Iraq War]] being the biggest divider. The couple express their hope that through the project, people will be reminded that despite differences, all Americans can agree that they live in a very beautiful and unique country.

== Exhibit ==

On October 17, 2007 a nationwide traveling exhibit, displaying all 50 paintings, music, video footage, and journal entries from the journey began. It started in [[Aiken, South Carolina]] at Aiken Center for the Arts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7202">The '''Symbolic''' (or '''Symbolic Order''') is a part of the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory of [[Jacques Lacan]], part of his attempt "to distinguish between those elementary registers whose grounding I later put forward in these terms: the symbolic, the imaginary, and the real — a distinction never previously made in psychoanalysis".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise==

Lacan's early work was centred on an exploration of [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]], of those "specific images, which we refer to by the ancient term of ''imago''. ... it set out from their formative function in the subject".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore "[t]he notion of the "symbolic came to the forefront in the Rome Report [1953] ... henceforth it is the symbolic, not the imaginary, that is seen to be the determining order of the subject".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Sheridan]],"Translator' Note", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994) p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacan's concept of the symbolic "owes much to a key event in the rise of structuralism ... the publication of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' in 1949. ... In many ways, the symbolic is for Lacan an equivalent to Lévi-Strauss's order of culture":&lt;ref&gt;[[David Macey]], "Introduction", Lacan, ''Four'', p. xxii and p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt; a language-mediated order of culture. "Man speaks, then, but it is because the symbol has made him man ... superimposes the kingdom of culture on that of a nature".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 65–6&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting then that "language is the basic social institution in the sense that all others presuppose language",&lt;ref&gt;[[John R. Searle]], ''The Construction of Social Reality'' (London 1995) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan found in [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s linguistic division of the verbal sign between signifier and signified a new key to the Freudian understanding that "his therapeutic method was 'a talking cure'".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud and Joseph Breuer, quoted in Macey, ''Four'', p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triumph==

For a decade or so after the Rome Report, Lacan found in the concept of the symbolic an answer to the neurotic problematic of the imaginary: "It is the task of symbolism to forbid imaginary capture ... supremacy of the symbolic over the imaginary ... supremacy of the symbolic over the real".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques-Alain Miller, "Commentary" in Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 332 and p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting through Lévi-Strauss the anthropological premise that "man is indeed an 'animal symbolicum'", and that "the self-illumination of society through symbols is an essential part of social reality",&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Schutz, ''The Problem of Social Reality'' (The Hague 1973) p. 356 and p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan made the leap to seeing "the Oedipus complex - in so far as we continue to recognise it as covering the whole field of our experience with its signification"&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; - as the point whereby the weight of social reality was mediated to the developing child by the (symbolic) father: "It is in the ''[[name of the Father]]'' that we must recognize the support of the symbolic function which, from the dawn of history, has identified his person with the figure of the law".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The imaginary now came to be seen increasingly as belonging to the earlier, closed realm of the dual relationship of mother and child — "[[Melanie Klein]] describes the relation to the mother as a mirrored relationship ... [neglecting] the third term, the father"&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Seminar III, in J. Mitchell and J. Rose, ''Feminine Sexuality'' (New York 1982) p. 57–8&lt;/ref&gt; — to be broken up and opened to the wider symbolic order.

Lacan's shorthand for that wider world was the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] — "the big other, that is, the other of language, the Names-of-the-Father, signifiers or words [which] ... are public, communal property".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hill, ''Lacan for Beginners'' (London 1997) p. 160 and p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; But though it is an essentially linguistic dimension, Lacan does not simply equate the symbolic with language, since the latter is involved also in the Imaginary and [[the Real]]. The symbolic dimension of language is that of the [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]], in which elements have no positive existence but are constituted by virtue of their mutual differences.

The [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] is the discourse of the Other and thus belongs to the symbolic order. It is also the realm of the Law that regulates desire in the [[Oedipus complex]], and is determinant of [[subjectivity]]. "The unconscious is the sum of the effects of speech on a subject, at the level at which the subject constitutes himself out of the effects of the signifier ... we depend on the field of the Other, which was there long before we came into the world, and whose circulating structures determine us as subjects"&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Four'', p. 126 and p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; on the symbolic order.

==Eclipse==

With the Sixties, the early rush of expectations associated with the concept of the symbolic order had begun to fade, and the symbolic was increasingly seen as ''part'' of the human condition, rather than as a therapeutic cure-all. Lacan's critical attention began to shift instead to the concept of the Real, seen as "that over which the symbolic stumbles ... that which is lacking in the symbolic order, the ineliminable residue of all articulation ... the umbilical cord of the symbolic".&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, ''Four'', p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

By the turn of the decade, "(1968–71) Lacan gradually came to dismiss the Oedipus ... as 'Freud's dream'"&lt;ref&gt;J. Clemens and R. Grigg eds., ''Jacques Lacan and the Other Side of Psychoanalysis: Reflections on Seminar XVII'' (London 2006) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; — despite his own earlier warning of the dangers if "one wishes to ignore the symbolic articulation that Freud discovered at the same time as the unconscious ... his methodical reference to the Oedipus complex".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether his development of the concept of ''[[jouissance]]'', or 'the "identification with the ''[[sinthome]]''" (as the naming of one's Real) advocated in Lacan's last works as the aim of psychoanalysis',&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo Chiesa, ''Subjectivity and Otherness'' (London 2007) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; will in time prove as fruitful as that of the symbolic order perhaps remains to be seen. Part of Lacan's enduring legacy will surely however remain bound up with the triumphal exploration of the symbolic order that was the Rome Report: "Symbols in fact envelop the life of man in a network so total that they join together ... the shape of his destiny".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Écrits'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6035">'''Trade-off talking rational economic person''' ('''TOTREP''') is one term, among various, used to denote, in the field of [[choice]] analysis, the rational, human agent of economic decisions.

==Origin of the term==
The term was first used notably in [[David M. Kreps]]' ''Notes on the Theory of Choice'' (1988).&lt;ref name=kreps&gt;
{{cite book |last=Kreps |first=David M.|author-link= David M. Kreps|editor-last= |editor-first= |title=Notes on the Theory of Choice|place= Boulder and London, Colorado, USA|publisher=Westview Press |date=1988 |pages= |chapter= |isbn=0-8133-7553-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kreps, in his preface, acknowledges Mike Harrison for first using the acronym '''Totrep'''. In his work on the theory of choice, [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/he/subject/Economics/Microeconomics/GameTheory/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780192803030 Michael Allingham] characterizes the notion "denoted by TOTREP" as something "both to admire and worry about".&lt;ref name=rat&gt;Allingham, Michael. ''Rational Choice'', [[Macmillan Publishers|London and Basingstoke: Macmillan]], 5 September 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of the concept of the Trade-off Talking Rational Economic Person are now routinely conducted in the related fields of theory of choice, the mathematics of decision making,&lt;ref name=harv&gt;E.g.[http://www.math.harvard.edu/archive/qr26_00/assignments/U1.pdf "The Logic of Preferences"], assignment in [[Harvard University]], Spring 2000&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

==Attributes==
'''Totrep''' denotes an agent of economic decisions with [[Preference_(economics)#Strict_versus_weak|strict preferences]]. The setting of the [[Preference_learning#Preference_relations|preference relations]] presumes&lt;ref name=fla&gt;[http://plaza.ufl.edu/cpiette/Semester2/Info01.pdf "Theory of Choice"], [[University of Florida]]&lt;/ref&gt; that
* One, single person, i.e. Totrep, is making choices;
* A set of finite choices of possible outcomes is proposed, each associated with a defined or undefined probability of happening; the sum of probabilities equals 1;
* Totrep's preferences are defined [[Axiom#Mathematical_logic|axiom]]atically among the choices proposed;
* The [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]] of Totrep's preferences is stated through a [[utility function]], which is typically a function from Totrep's [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of choice to real numbers;
* The axioms defining Totrep's preferences must be both [[Sufficient#Sufficient_conditions|sufficient]] (if axioms hold, then representation is possible) and [[Sufficient#Necessary_conditions|necessary]] (if representation holds, then axioms must hold); and finally
* The axioms are consistent (axioms can be satisfied simultaneously), [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] (no subset of axioms implies the others, i.e. there is no overlap), and [[Philosophy_of_mathematics#Intuitionism|intuitive]] (easy to understand).

==Ethical considerations==
In attempts to legitimatize economic theory as ethical, the question was asked about how to "teach or preach to economists or ethicists how to become more ethical".&lt;ref name=eth&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-18669964/ethics-and-efficiency-organizations.html "Ethics and efficiency in organizations"] by Kjell Hausken, ''[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/products/journals/journals.htm?PHPSESSID=05qst304u87622chcifb69vp55&amp;id=ijse|International Journal of Social Economics]'', 1 September 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In this, social scientist [https://web.archive.org/web/20070125142053/http://www1.uis.no/vit/oks/hausken/ Kjell Hausken] posits the notion that, "if acting virtuously contributes to a character or personality which subsequently and indirectly influences economic [agent]'s reputation beneficially in the long run, then this action is to be recommended if the long-term benefit of the beneficial reputation outweighs the short-term benefit of a more deceitful or vicious action."&lt;ref name=eth /&gt; Hausken observes that, the "ethical economic [agent]" is actually "a trade-off talking rational economic person", who constantly carries out "a [[cost–benefit analysis]] where [[Reputation#Reputation-based_decisions|reputation]] is a relevant input, constantly focusing on her real [[Enlightened self-interest|interests in a broad sense]], and constantly thinking [[long term]]."&lt;ref name=eth /&gt;

==Empirical objections==
Empirical research, from the 1970s onwards (research that eventually established the field of [[behavioral economics]]), showed that the Totrep model of rationality cannot be safely considered as representative of real-life human affairs.

Kreps himself initially describes the models of choice presented in his book as both [[Normative#Social_sciences_and_economics|normative]] and [[Scientific_theory#Description_and_prediction|descriptive]] but, in the final chapter of his book, where he briefly outlines the paradoxes of [[Allais paradox|Allais]] (1953) and [[Ellsberg paradox|Ellsberg]] (1961), ultimately acknowledges that Totrep modelling should be presumed to be merely normative, since the "evidence [shows] individuals are very poor intuitive [[statistician]]s" and "use [[heuristic]] procedures which sometimes bias their choices in ways that the standard models don't capture."&lt;ref name=kreps /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2392">In [[mathematics]], a '''trivial semigroup''' (a  '''semigroup with one element''') is a [[semigroup]] for which the [[cardinality]] of the [[underlying set]] is [[one]]. The number of [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinct]] [[isomorphic|nonisomorphic]] semigroups with one element is one. If ''S'' = { ''a'' } is a semigroup with one element then the [[Cayley table]] of ''S'' is as given below:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! 
! ''a''
|-
|&amp;nbsp; ''' ''a'' '''&amp;nbsp; 
|&amp;nbsp; ''a'' &amp;nbsp;  
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The only element in ''S'' is the [[Absorbing element|zero element]] 0 of ''S'' and is also the [[identity element]] 1 of ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;A H Clifford, G B Preston (1964). ''The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups Vol. I'' (Second Edition). [[American Mathematical Society]].  {{ISBN|978-0-8218-0272-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However not all semigroup theorists consider the unique element in a semigroup with one element as the zero element of the semigroup. They define zero elements only in semigroups having at least two elements.&lt;ref&gt;
P A Grillet (1995). ''Semigroups''. [[CRC Press]].  {{ISBN|978-0-8247-9662-4}} pp.3-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J M Howie|title=An Introduction to Semigroup Theory|publisher=Academic Press|year=1976|series=L.M.S.Monographs|volume=7}} pp.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of its extreme triviality, the semigroup with one element is important in many situations. It is the starting point for understanding the [[structure]] of semigroups. It serves as a [[counterexample]] in illuminating many situations. For example, the semigroup with one element is the only semigroup in which 0 = 1, that is, the zero element and the identity element are equal. 
Further, if ''S'' is a semigroup with one element, the semigroup obtained by adjoining an identity element to ''S'' is isomorphic to the semigroup obtained by adjoining a zero element to ''S''.

The semigroup with one element is also a [[group (mathematics)|group]].

In the language of [[category theory]], any semigroup with one element is a [[Initial and terminal objects|terminal object]] in the category of semigroups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18028">In the [[security engineering]] subspecialty of [[computer science]], a '''trusted system''' is a system that is relied upon to a specified extent to enforce a specified security policy. This is equivalent to saying that a trusted system is one whose failure would break a security policy (if a policy exists that the trusted system is trusted to enforce).

The meaning of the word "trust" is critical, as it does not carry the meaning that might be expected in everyday usage. A system trusted by a user, is one that the user feels safe to use, and trusts to do tasks without secretly executing harmful or unauthorised programs; while trusted computing refers to whether programs can trust the platform to be unmodified from that expected, whether or not those programs are innocent, [[malware|malicious]] or execute tasks that are undesired by the user.

==Trusted systems in classified information==

A subset of trusted systems ("Division B" and "Division A") implement [[mandatory access control]] (MAC) labels; as such, it is often assumed that they can be used for processing [[classified information]]. However, this is generally untrue. There are four modes in which one can operate a multilevel secure system: multilevel mode, compartmented mode, dedicated mode, and system-high mode. The National Computer Security Center's "Yellow Book" specifies that B3 and A1 systems can only be used for processing a strict subset of security labels, and only when operated according to a particularly strict configuration.

Central to the concept of [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]-style "trusted systems" is the notion of a "[[reference monitor]]", which is an entity that occupies the logical heart of the system and is responsible for all access control decisions. Ideally, the reference monitor is (a) tamper-proof, (b) always invoked, and (c) small enough to be subject to independent testing, the completeness of which can be assured. Per the U.S. [[National Security Agency]]'s 1983 [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria]] (TCSEC), or "Orange Book", a set of "evaluation classes" were defined that described the features and assurances that the user could expect from a trusted system.

Key to the provision of the highest levels of assurance (B3 and A1) is the dedication of significant system engineering toward minimization of the complexity (not ''size'', as often cited) of the [[trusted computing base]] (TCB), defined as that combination of hardware, software, and firmware that is responsible for enforcing the system's security policy.

An inherent engineering conflict would appear to arise in higher-assurance systems in that, the smaller the TCB, the larger the set of hardware, software, and firmware that lies outside the TCB and is, therefore, untrusted.  Although this may lead the more technically naive to sophists' arguments about the nature of trust, the argument confuses the issue of "correctness" with that of "trustworthiness".

In contrast to the TCSEC's precisely defined hierarchy of six evaluation classes&amp;mdash;the highest of which, A1, is featurally identical to B3, differing only in documentation standards&amp;mdash;the more recently introduced [[Common Criteria]] (CC)&amp;mdash;which derive from a blend of more or less technically mature standards from various [[NATO]] countries&amp;mdash;provide a more tenuous spectrum of seven "evaluation classes" that intermix features and assurances in an arguably non-hierarchical manner and lack the philosophic precision and mathematical stricture of the TCSEC. In particular, the CC tolerate very loose identification of the "target of evaluation" (TOE) and support&amp;mdash;even encourage&amp;mdash;an inter-mixture of security requirements culled from a variety of predefined "protection profiles." While a strong case can be made that even the more seemingly arbitrary components of the TCSEC contribute to a "chain of evidence" that a fielded system properly enforces its advertised security policy, not even the highest (E7) level of the CC can truly provide analogous consistency and stricture of evidentiary reasoning.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The mathematical notions of trusted systems for the protection of [[classified information]] derive from two independent but interrelated corpora of work. In 1974, David Bell and Leonard LaPadula of MITRE, working under the close technical guidance and economic sponsorship of Maj. Roger Schell, Ph.D., of the U.S. Army Electronic Systems Command (Ft. Hanscom, MA), devised what is known as the [[Bell-LaPadula model]], in which a more or less trustworthy computer system is modeled in terms of '''objects''' (passive repositories or destinations for data, such as files, disks, printers) and '''subjects''' (active entities&amp;mdash;perhaps users, or system processes or threads operating on behalf of those users&amp;mdash;that cause information to flow among objects). The entire operation of a computer system can indeed be regarded a "history" (in the serializability-theoretic sense) of pieces of information flowing from object to object in response to subjects' requests for such flows.

At the same time, Dorothy Denning at Purdue University was publishing her Ph.D. dissertation, which dealt with "lattice-based information flows" in computer systems. (A mathematical "lattice" is a partially ordered set, characterizable as a directed acyclic graph, in which the relationship between any two vertices is either "dominates," "is dominated by," or neither.) She defined a generalized notion of "labels"&amp;mdash;corresponding more or less to the full security markings one encounters on classified military documents, ''e.g.'', TOP SECRET WNINTEL TK DUMBO&amp;mdash;that are attached to entities.  Bell and LaPadula integrated Denning's concept into their landmark MITRE technical report&amp;mdash;entitled, ''Secure Computer System: Unified Exposition and Multics Interpretation''&amp;mdash;whereby labels attached to objects represented the sensitivity of data contained within the object (though there can be, and often is, a subtle semantic difference between the sensitivity of the data within the object and the sensitivity of the object itself), while labels attached to subjects represented the trustworthiness of the user executing the subject. The concepts are unified with two properties, the "simple security property" (a subject can only read from an object that it ''dominates'' [''is greater than'' is a close enough&amp;mdash;albeit mathematically imprecise&amp;mdash;interpretation]) and the "confinement property," or "*-property" (a subject can only write to an object that dominates it). (These properties are loosely referred to as "no-read-up" and "no-write-down," respectively.) Jointly enforced, these properties ensure that information cannot flow "downhill" to a repository whence insufficiently trustworthy recipients may discover it. By extension, assuming that the labels assigned to subjects are truly representative of their trustworthiness, then the  no-read-up and no-write-down rules rigidly enforced by the reference monitor are provably sufficient to constrain [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]], one of the most general classes of attack (''sciz.'', the popularly reported [[Computer worm|worms]] and [[viruses]] are specializations of the Trojan horse concept).

The Bell-LaPadula model technically only enforces "confidentiality," or "secrecy," controls, ''i.e.'', they address the problem of the sensitivity of objects and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately disclose it. The dual problem of "integrity"(i.e., the problem of accuracy, or even provenance of objects)  and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately modify or destroy it, is addressed by mathematically affine models; the most important of which is named for its creator, [[Biba_Model|K. J. Biba]]. Other integrity models include the [[Clark-Wilson model]] and Shockley and Schell's program integrity model, "The SeaView Model"&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, Teresa &amp; Denning, Dorothy &amp; R. Schell, Roger &amp; Heckman, Mark &amp; R. Shockley, William. (1990). The SeaView Security Model.. IEEE Trans. Software Eng.. 16. 593-607. 10.1109/SECPRI.1988.8114. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220071090_The_SeaView_Security_Model (Source)]&lt;/ref&gt;

An important feature of MACs, is that they are entirely beyond the control of any user. The TCB automatically attaches labels to any subjects executed on behalf of users and files they access or modify. In contrast, an additional class of controls, termed [[discretionary access control]]s(DACs), '''are''' under the direct control of the system users. Familiar protection mechanisms such as [[File_system_permissions#Numeric_notation|permission bits]] (supported by UNIX since the late 1960s and&amp;mdash;in a more flexible and powerful form&amp;mdash;by Multics since earlier still) and [[access control list|access control lists (ACLs)]] are familiar examples of DACs.

The behavior of a trusted system is often characterized in terms of a mathematical model&amp;mdash;which may be more or less rigorous depending upon applicable operational and administrative constraints&amp;mdash;that takes the form of a [[finite state machine]] (FSM) with state criteria, state [[transition constraint]]s, a set of "operations" that correspond to state transitions (usually, but not necessarily, one), and a [[Multiple_single-level#Cross-domain_solutions|descriptive top-level specification]] (DTLS) which entails a user-perceptible [[interface (computing)|interface]] (''e.g.'', an [[API]], a set of [[system call]]s [in [[UNIX]] parlance] or [[Exit_(system_call)|system exit]]s [in [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] parlance]); each element of which engenders one or more model operations.

==Trusted systems in trusted computing==

The [[Trusted Computing Group]] creates specifications that are meant to address particular requirements of trusted systems, including attestation of configuration and safe storage of sensitive information.

==Trusted systems in policy analysis==

Trusted systems in the context of [[national security|national]] or [[homeland security]], [[code enforcement|law enforcement]], or [[social control]] policy are systems in which some conditional [[prediction]] about the behavior of people or objects within the system has been determined prior to authorizing access to system resources.&lt;ref&gt;The concept of trusted systems described here is discussed in Taipale, K.A. (2005). [http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MIS.2005.89 The Trusted Systems Problem: Security Envelopes, Statistical Threat Analysis, and the Presumption of Innocence], Homeland Security - Trends and Controversies, IEEE Intelligent Systems, Vol. 20 No. 5, pp. 80-83 (Sept./Oct. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, trusted systems include the use of "security envelopes" in national security and counterterrorism applications, "[[trusted computing]]" initiatives in technical systems security, and the use of [[credit score|credit or identity scoring]] systems in financial and anti-fraud applications; in general, they include any system (i) in which probabilistic threat or [[Probabilistic risk assessment|risk analysis]] is used to assess "trust" for decision-making before authorizing access or for allocating resources against likely threats (including their use in the design of systems [[Integrity constraints|constraints]] to control behavior within the system), or (ii) in which [[deviation analysis (computing)|deviation analysis]] or systems [[surveillance]] is used to ensure that behavior within systems complies with expected or authorized parameters.

The widespread adoption of these authorization-based security strategies (where the default state is DEFAULT=DENY) for counterterrorism, anti-fraud, and other purposes is helping accelerate the ongoing transformation of modern societies from a notional Beccarian model of [[criminal justice]] based on accountability for deviant actions after they occur – see [[Cesare Beccaria]], On Crimes and Punishment (1764) – to a Foucauldian model based on authorization, preemption, and general social compliance through ubiquitous preventative [[surveillance]] and control through system constraints – see [[Michel Foucault]], ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975, [[Alan Sheridan]], tr., 1977, 1995).

In this emergent model, "security" is geared not towards [[policing]] but to [[risk management]] through [[surveillance]], exchange of information, [[auditing]], communication, and [[Categorization|classification]].  These developments have led to general concerns about individual [[privacy]] and [[civil liberty]] and to a broader [[philosophical]] debate about the appropriate forms of [[social control|social governance]] methodologies.

==Trusted systems in information theory==

Trusted systems in the context of [[information theory]] is based on the definition of trust as ''''Trust is that which is essential to a communication channel but cannot be transferred from a source to a destination using that channel'''' by Ed Gerck.&lt;ref name="Trust Points"&gt;Feghhi, J. and P. Williams (1998) ''Trust Points'', in Digital Certificates: Applied Internet Security. Addison-Wesley, {{ISBN|0-201-30980-7}}; [http://mcwg.org/mcg-mirror/trustdef.htm Toward Real-World Models of Trust: Reliance on Received Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Information Theory]], information has nothing to do with knowledge or meaning. In the context of Information Theory, information is simply that which is transferred from a source to a destination, using a communication channel. If, before transmission, the information is available at the destination then the transfer is zero. Information received by a party is that which the party does not expect—as measured by the uncertainty of the party as to what the message will be.

Likewise, trust as defined by Gerck has nothing to do with friendship, acquaintances, employee-employer relationships, loyalty, betrayal and other overly-variable concepts.  Trust is not taken  in the purely subjective sense either,  nor as a feeling or something purely personal or psychological—trust is understood as something potentially communicable. Further, this definition of trust is abstract, allowing different instances and observers in a trusted system  to communicate based on a common idea of trust (otherwise communication would be isolated in domains), where all necessarily different subjective and intersubjective realizations of trust in each subsystem (man and machines) may coexist.&lt;ref name="Trust as Qualified Reliance"&gt;[http://nma.com/papers/it-trust-part1.pdf Trust as Qualified Reliance on Information, Part I], The COOK Report on Internet, Volume X, No. 10, January 2002, {{ISSN|1071-6327}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together in the model of Information Theory, '''information is what you do not expect''' and '''trust is what you know'''. Linking both concepts, trust is seen as  '''qualified reliance on received information'''. In terms of trusted systems, an assertion of trust cannot be based on the record itself, but on information from other information channels.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, John D. (1997). [http://pages.ca.inter.net/~euclid1/call.html John D. Electronic Legal Records: Pretty Good Authentication?]&lt;/ref&gt; The deepening of these questions leads to complex conceptions of trust which have been thoroughly studied in the context of business relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Huemer, L. (1998). [http://www.borea.nu/index.asp?PAGE=1&amp;ARTICLE=1&amp;saID=78 Trust in business relations: Economic logic or social interaction?] Umeå: Boréa. {{ISBN|91-89140-02-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also leads to conceptions of information where the "quality" of information integrates trust or trustworthiness in the structure of the information itself and of the information system(s) in which it is conceived: higher quality in terms of particular definitions of accuracy and precision means higher trustworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kristo Ivanov|Ivanov, K.]]  (1972). [http://www.informatik.umu.se/~kivanov/diss-avh.html Quality-control of information: On the concept of accuracy of information in data banks and in management information systems].The University of Stockholm and The Royal Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

An introduction to the calculus of trust (Example: 'If I connect two trusted systems, are they more or less trusted when taken together?') is given in.&lt;ref name="Trust as Qualified Reliance" /&gt;

The [[IBM]] Federal Software Group &lt;ref name="Daly, Christopher"&gt;Daly, Christopher. (2004). A Trust Framework for the DoD Network-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Environment, IBM Corp., 2004. (Request from the IEEE Computer Society's [http://issaa.org/documents/ ISSAA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726192910/http://issaa.org/documents/ |date=2011-07-26 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that &lt;ref name="Trust Points" /&gt; provides the most useful definition of trust for application in an information technology environment, because it is related to other information theory concepts and provides a basis for measuring trust. In a network centric enterprise services environment, such notion of trust is considered &lt;ref name="Daly, Christopher" /&gt; to be requisite for achieving the desired collaborative, service-oriented architecture vision.

The notation counts the number of [[leading wheel]]s, then the number of [[driving wheel]]s, and finally the number of [[trailing wheel]]s, groups of numbers being separated by dashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=201| title=Builder's plates: A locomotive's birth certificate| publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing]]| author=Thompson, Keith| date=2006-05-01| accessdate=2008-02-08| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122011919/http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=201| archivedate=22 November 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other classification schemes, like [[UIC classification]] and the French, Turkish and [[Swiss locomotive and railcar classification|Swiss]] systems for steam locomotives, count axles rather than wheels.

In the notation a locomotive with two leading axles (four wheels) in front, then three driving axles (six wheels) and then one trailing axle (two wheels) is classified as [[4-6-2]], and is commonly known as a ''Pacific''.

== Method ==

=== Articulated locomotives ===
[[Articulated locomotive]]s such as [[Garratt]]s, which are effectively two locomotives joined by a common [[boiler]], have a + between the arrangements of each engine. Thus a "double Pacific" type Garratt is a 4-6-2+2-6-4.  For Garratt locomotives the + sign is used even when there are no intermediate unpowered wheels, e.g. the [[LMS Garratt]] [[2-6-0+0-6-2]].  This is because the two engine units are more than just [[power bogie]]s. They are complete engines, carrying fuel and water tanks. The + sign represents the bridge (carrying the boiler) that links the two engines.

Simpler articulated types such as [[Mallet (locomotive)|Mallet]]s, have a jointed frame under a common boiler where there are no unpowered wheels between the sets of powered wheels. Typically, the forward frame is free to swing, whereas the rear frame is rigid with the boiler. Thus a [[Union Pacific Big Boy]] is a 4-8-8-4; four leading wheels, one group of eight driving wheels, another group of eight driving wheels, and then four trailing wheels.

=== Duplex locomotives ===
This numbering system is shared by [[Duplex locomotive|duplex locomotives]], which have powered wheel sets sharing a rigid frame.

=== Suffixes ===
No suffix means a [[tender locomotive]].

T indicates a [[tank locomotive]]: in European practice, this is sometimes extended to indicate the type of tank locomotive: T means [[side tank]], PT [[pannier tank]], ST [[Saddle tank (locomotive)|saddle tank]], WT [[well tank]]. T+T means a tank locomotive that also has a tender.

In Europe, the suffix R can signify rack (0-6-0RT) or reversible (0-6-0TR), the latter being ''Bi-cabine'' locomotives used in France.

The suffix F indicates a [[fireless locomotive]] (0-4-0F). This locomotive has no tender.

Other suffixes have been used, including ng for [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] (less than {{RailGauge|1435mm}} ) and CA or ca for compressed air (running on compressed air from a tank instead of steam from a boiler).

=== Internal combustion locomotives ===
In Britain, small diesel and [[gasoline|petrol]] locomotives are usually classified in the same way as steam locomotives, e.g. 0-4-0, 0-6-0, 0-8-0. This may be followed by D for diesel or P for petrol, and another letter describing the transmission: E for electric, H hydraulic, M mechanical. Thus, 0-6-0DE denotes a six-wheel diesel locomotive with electric transmission. Where the axles are coupled by chains or shafts (rather than side rods) or are individually driven, the terms 4w, 6w or 8w are generally used. Thus, 4wPE indicates a four-wheel petrol locomotive with electric transmission. For large diesel locomotives the [[UIC classification]] is used.

== Limitations ==
The main limitation of Whyte Notation is that it does not cover non-standard types such as [[Shay locomotive]]s, which use geared trucks rather than driving wheels. The most commonly used system in Europe outside the United Kingdom is UIC classification, based on German practice, which can define the exact layout of a locomotive.

== Naming ==
In American (and to a lesser extent British) practice, most wheel arrangements in common use were given names, sometimes from the name of the first such locomotive built. For example, the [[2-2-0]] type arrangement is named ''Planet'', after [[Planet (locomotive)|the 1830 locomotive]] on which it was first used. (This naming convention is similar to the naming of warship classes.)

=== Common wheel arrangements ===
The most common wheel arrangements are listed below. In the diagrams, the front of the locomotive is to the left.

He is surrounded by eight [[Buddharupa|Buddhas]] and [[bodhisattva]]s (clockwise from top: [[Ratnasambhava]], [[Samantabhadra]], Saṅkusumitarāja, [[Manjushri]], [[Amitābha]], [[Avalokiteśvara]], [[Amoghasiddhi]] and [[Maitreya]])]]
In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, the '''Womb Realm''' ({{lang-sa|garbhakoṣadhātu}}, {{lang-ja|胎蔵界}} ''taizōkai'') is the metaphysical space inhabited by the [[Wisdom King]]s. The Womb Realm is based on the ''[[Mahavairocana Tantra]]''. The name of the mandala derives from chapter 2 of the sutra, where it is said that the buddha [[Vairocana|Mahāvairocana]] revealed the mandala's secret teachings to his disciple [[Vajrasattva]] from his "womb of compassion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-231-11286-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other translations, the term ''matrix realm'' or Matrix Mandala are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hakeda | first = Yoshito S. | title = Kūkai and His Major Works | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-231-05933-7 | pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Womb Realm is a very popular subject for [[mandala]]s, and along with the [[Diamond Realm]] (''vajradhātu'') Mandala forms the [[Mandala of the Two Realms]].  This mandala, along with the Diamond Realm, form the core of Japanese [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] Buddhist rituals, including [[abhisheka]] "initiation". In this ritual, new initiates are blindfolded and asked to toss a flower upon a mandala.  Where the flower lands helps decide which Buddhist figure the student should devote themselves to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hakeda | first = Yoshito S. | title = Kūkai and His Major Works | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-231-05933-7 | pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional Shingon halls, the Womb Realm Mandala is hung on the east wall, symbolizing the young stage of Mahāvairocana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hakeda | first = Yoshito S. | title = Kūkai and His Major Works | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-231-05933-7 | pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;In this setting, the Diamond Realm Mandala is hung on the west wall symbolizing the final realization of Mahāvairocana.

The '''World Kindness Movement''' ('''WKM''') is the peak global kindness body, a movement with no religious, political or commercial affiliation. The WKM’s chief object is to foster goodwill among the broad community – local, national and international – by way of collaborations in kindness and in so doing, create greater understanding and co-operation between all people and all nations throughout the world. WKM is a worldwide coalition of the Good-Willing various ''kindness movements''—organizations that study and promote improved individual and collective human behavior. The movement was initially conceptualized in 1997 with the aim of bringing like minded kindness movements across the globe together. The current members of the movement represent 27 nations including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, India, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Nepal, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Pakistan, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, Romania, Scotland, South Korea, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, United Kingdom and 10 organisations from the USA.

== History ==

The idea of a World Kindness Movement was conceived at a Tokyo conference in 1996 when founders of the Small Kindness Movement in Japan brought together like-minded individuals from around the world who had started kindness movements in their own countries. They were led by Dr. [[Wataru Mori]], a physician in Tokyo, who envisioned that a more compassionate and peaceful world could be achieved if a critical mass of acts of kindness was ignited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sweet Milk of Human Kindness | date=7 May 2009 | publisher=Africa News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CosmosBipinnatus002.JPG|thumb|170px|[[Cosmos bipinnatus]], official flower of the World Kindness Movement]]
A second conference was held in 1997 in which the World Kindness Movement was formed. The founding members of the movement were Japan, Singapore, Australia, Canada, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Celebrating kindness |url=http://www.hindu.com/2001/06/10/stories/1310046b.htm| accessdate=4 January 2013 | date=10 June 2001 | publisher=[[The Hindu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the '''1999''' World Kindness Movement conference in Tokyo, the [[cosmos bipinnatus]] was adopted as the official flower for the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://flowerinfo.org/cosmo-flowers | title=Cosmo Flowers |work=Flowerinfo.org | accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement was then officially launched in Singapore in '''November 2000''' at the Third WKM Conference, hosted by the Singapore Kindness Movement. The conference saw 33 delegates from 22 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kindacts.net/world_kindness/world_kindness.shtml | title=World Kindness-Kind Acts | accessdate=2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''2003''', the [[Singapore Kindness Movement]] assumed the role of secretariat of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Kindness around the world | author=Trish Clancy | year=2007 | publisher=World Kindness Movement | isbn=978-981-05-9260-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Random Acts of Kindness Foundation]] is one of the United States delegates of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.randomactsofkindness.org/About/About-Us.html | title=Random Acts of Kindness - About Us | accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2010''' the 6th General Assembly was hosted by Australia in Sydney for the first time at the Conservatorium of Music organised by Mr Michael Lloyd-White with the support of the NSW Department of Education, The NSW Federation of Parents &amp; Citizens Associations and Spotless Group. Singapore indicated it wished to pass the kindness torch on and see the secretariat hosted by another nation referring to the 6th General Assembly host as a potential secretariat in waiting.
