The '''64DD''' is a magnetic disk drive peripheral for the [[Nintendo 64]] game console developed by [[Nintendo]]. It was originally announced in 1995, prior to the Nintendo 64's 1996 launch, and after numerous delays was finally released only in [[Japan]] on December 1, 1999. The "64" references both the Nintendo 64 console and the 64 MB storage capacity of the disks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Ultra 64 Tech Specs|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=14|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=February 1996|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "DD" is short for "disk drive" or "dynamic drive".&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"&gt;{{cite web | first=Peer | last=Schneider | title=Everything About the 64DD | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/02/10/everything-about-the-64dd | publisher=IGN | date=February 9, 2001 | accessdate=June 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plugging into the extension port on the underside of the console, it allows the Nintendo 64 to use proprietary 64&amp;nbsp;MB [[magnetic disk]]s for expanded and rewritable data storage, a [[real-time clock]] for [[persistent world|persistent game world]] design, and a standard font and audio library for further storage efficiency. Furthermore, the 64DD's software titles and hardware accessories let the user create movies, characters, and animations to be used within various games and shared online. The system could connect to the Internet through a now-defunct dedicated online service called [[#Randnet|Randnet]] for [[e-commerce]],&lt;ref name="64DD at NOM 3"/&gt; [[Online console gaming|online gaming]], and media sharing.&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises" /&gt; Calling it "the first writable bulk data storage device for a modern video game console",&lt;ref name="N64 Dev Conf 1997"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo Reveals New Details on 64DD at N64 Developer's Conference | date=1997 | publisher=Nintendo of America | url=https://www.nintendo.com/newsroom/articles/64dd.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970606100126/https://www.nintendo.com/newsroom/articles/64dd.html | archivedate=June 6, 1997 | accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo designed the 64DD as an [[enabling technology]] platform for the development of new genres of games and applications,&lt;ref name="The 64Dream Dec 1997" /&gt; dozens of which were in development for several years.

Only ten software titles were released until the unit was discontinued in February 2001. It was a [[list of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]],&lt;ref name="Unrivaled Champion of the Fourth Generation"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627063043/http://gameconsoles.co.uk/game-consoles/snes/ | archivedate=June 27, 2008 | url=http://gameconsoles.co.uk/game-consoles/snes/ | website=GameConsoles.co.uk | title=Super Nintendo Entertainment System Unrivaled Champion of the Fourth Generation | date=2007 | accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with at least 15,000 total units sold&lt;ref name="64Dream Feb 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The 64 Dream | magazine=The 64 Dream | date=February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another 85,000 units unsold.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Upon the decline of 64DD's commercial viability, most such software titles were either ultimately delivered on Nintendo 64 cartridges alone, ported to other consoles like the [[GameCube]], or canceled altogether.

IGN summarized the 64DD as "an appealing creativity package"&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises" /&gt; "targeted at a certain type of user"&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN" /&gt; "that delivered a well-designed user-driven experience"—and a "limited online experiment at the same time", which partially fulfilled Nintendo president [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]]'s "longtime dream of a network that connects Nintendo consoles all across the nation".&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN" /&gt;

== History ==

=== Development ===
With the 1993 announcement of its new Project Reality console, Nintendo explored options for data storage. A Nintendo spokesperson said in 1993 that "it could be a cartridge system, a CD system, or both, or something not ever used before."&lt;ref name="Billboard September 4, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Nintendo, Silicon Graphics Team for Reality Check | first=Chris | last=McGowan |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=September 4, 1993 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;d#v=onepage&amp;q=silicon%20graphics&amp;f=false | page=89 | accessdate=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Howard Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of America said, "Right now, cartridges offer faster access time and more speed of movement and characters than CDs. So, we'll introduce our new hardware with cartridges. But eventually, these problems with CDs will be overcome. When that happens, you'll see Nintendo using CD as the software storage medium for our 64-bit system."&lt;ref name="Billboard: June 25, 1994"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UggEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q=Howard%20Lincoln&amp;f=false | title=Billboard (June 25, 1994) | last=Gillen | first=Marilyn A. | publisher=Billboard | newspaper=Billboard | date=June 25, 1994 | accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77}}

In consideration of the 64DD's actual launch price equivalent of about {{US$|90}}, Nintendo software engineering manager Jim Merrick warned, "We're very sensitive to the cost of the console. We could get an eight-speed CD-ROM mechanism in the unit, but in the under-$200 console market, it would be hard to pull that off."&lt;ref name="Kasten Off"&gt;{{ cite journal | last=Kasten | first=Alex S. | title=Off-Computer | work=Emedia Professional | volume= 10 | issue= 3 | date=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66}} Describing the final choice of proprietary floppy disks instead of CD-ROM, Nintendo game designer [[Shigesato Itoi]] explained, "CD holds a lot of data, DD holds a moderate amount of data and backs the data up, and [cartridge] ROMs hold the least data and process the fastest. By attaching a DD to the game console, we can drastically increase the number of possible genres."&lt;ref name="The 64Dream Dec 1997"/&gt;

{{details|topic=the Nintendo 64's alternate storage strategies and the optimizations involved with cartridges|Nintendo 64 Game Pak}}

The company also explored the forging of an early online strategy with Netscape, whose founding management had recently come directly from SGI, the company which had designed the core Nintendo 64 hardware.&lt;ref name="Remembering Netscape"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/07/25/8266639/index.htm | title=Remembering Netscape: The Birth Of The Web | magazine=Fortune | first=Adam | last=Lashinsky | date=July 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nintendo's Internet Connection"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo's Internet Connection | date=December 13, 1996 | author=IGN Staff | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1996/12/14/nintendos-internet-connection | work=IGN | accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within its budding online strategy, Nintendo reportedly considered multiplayer online gaming to be of the highest priority, even above that of web browsing.&lt;ref name="Nintendo's Internet Connection"/&gt; Several third party game developers were developing prominent online gaming features based on 64DD, including Ocean's ''Mission: Impossible'' deathmatches&lt;ref name="Nintendo's Internet Connection"/&gt; and Seta's four-player war simulation.&lt;ref name="64DD Goes to War"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate 64DD FAQ"/&gt; Nintendo would ultimately retain the core impetus of these ideas, but would drastically alter both plans over the following years, in favor of a floppy-based storage technology and the Randnet online software and service partner—although with no online multiplayer gaming support whatsoever.

===Announcement===
{{quote box | width=25% | align=right | quote=It would have been easier to understand if the DD was already included when the N64 first came out. It’s getting harder to explain after the fact. (laughs) | source=— Nintendo designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]&lt;ref name="The 64Dream Dec 1997"/&gt;}}
The 64DD was first announced at [[Nintendo]]'s 1995 [[Nintendo Space World|Shoshinkai]] trade show, at which time Nintendo said it would launch by the end of 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Nintendo's Lincoln Speaks Out on the Ultra 64! |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=January 1996|pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; although giving virtually no technical specifications yet.&lt;ref name="The Game is 64 Bits"&gt;{{cite journal | magazine=Popular Mechanics | date=April 1996 | first=James K. | last=Willcox | title=The Game is 64 Bits | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MGUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;d | page=134 | accessdate=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, its first public appearance wasn't until Nintendo's 8th Shoshinkai show of November 22—24, 1996, where IGN reported that the device nicknamed "Bulky Drive"&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="N64 Dev Conf 1997"/&gt; was one of the biggest items of the show.&lt;ref name="Report from Shoshinkai 96"&gt;{{cite web | title=Report from Shoshinkai | date=November 22, 1996 | author=IGN Staff | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/23/report-from-shoshinkai | accessdate=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Nintendo of America Chairman Howard Lincoln stated that the device had received its finalized hardware specifications and sported its own show booth. Nintendo's Director of Corporate Communications, Perrin Kaplan, made the company's first official launch window announcement for the peripheral, scheduled for late 1997 in Japan.&lt;ref name="Shoshinkai 96 at Nintendo.com"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo 64 Shoshinkai '96 | publisher=Nintendo of America | url=https://www.nintendo.com/newsroom/show_frame.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961222150158/https://www.nintendo.com/newsroom/show_frame.html | archivedate=December 22, 1996 | accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The 64DD: Nintendo's Disk Drive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="64DD delay at GameSpot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shoshinkai 1996 interview"&gt;{{ cite av media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZXA2pzrLlo | title=Nintendo SpaceWorld '96: Miyamoto Interview + Super Mario 64 on 64DD + Rumble Pak Unveiled | via=[[YouTube]] | accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly several developers attended the show to learn how to develop for 64DD, some having traveled from the US for the 64DD presentation and some having received 64DD development kits.&lt;ref name="Nintendo's Internet Connection"/&gt; The demonstration included an improvised disk conversion of the familiar ''Super Mario 64'' game to demonstrate the drive's operation and performance, and a graphics application mapping the audience's photographical portraits onto live 3D animated avatars—a feature which was ultimately incorporated and released in 2000 as ''[[Mario Artist: Talent Studio]]'' and the Capture Cassette.&lt;ref name="Shoshinkai 96 at Nintendo.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HL at Shoshinkai N64.com"&gt;{{cite web | title=N64.com Interviews Howard Lincoln | date=December 6, 1996 | publisher=IGN | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1996/12/07/n64com-interviews-howard-lincoln | accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included along with Enix in the early roster of committed 64DD developers, [[Rare (company)|Rare]] officially discounted any rumors of the peripheral's impending pre-release cancellation.&lt;ref name="Closing in on Shoshinkai"&gt;{{cite web | title=Closing in on Shoshinkai | date=November 15, 1996 | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/16/closing-in-on-shoshinkai | publisher=IGN | accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event featured ''Creator'', a music and animation game by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]],&lt;ref name="Creator and Mario Artist"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Zee 3 | title=Career timeline | url=http://www.zee-3.com/pickfordbros/career_timeline.php#nintendo | accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same UK company that had made ''Sound Tool'' for the Nintendo Ultra 64 development kit. They touted the game's ability to be integrated into other games, allowing a player to replace any such game's textures and possibly create new levels and characters. There was no playable version of ''Creator'' available at this show, but the project was later absorbed into ''[[Mario Artist: Paint Studio]]''.&lt;ref name="Creator and Mario Artist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio (Import)"/&gt; Nintendo also announced their plans to bundle the 64DD with a RAM expansion cartridge at the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Nintendo Unveils N64 Disk Drive |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=90|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1997|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the gaming press said the Shoshinkai show did not make as significant a 64DD reveal as Nintendo had promised, leaving the public still in the dark as far as the system's software lineup, practical capabilities, and release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Shoshinkai '97: Nintendo Gets in the Games|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=26|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=February 1997 |pages=18-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Semrad |first=Ed |title=Insert Coin|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=February 1997|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The 64DD Gets Real|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=102|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1997|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zelda 64'' (eventually released as the cartridge game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'') was seen as the 64DD's potential [[killer app]] in the months following the system's unveiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Future Memory |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=29|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=May 1997|page=46 |url=https://archive.org/stream/NEXT_Generation_29#page/n46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3–4, 1997, Nintendo of America hosted a Developer's Conference in Seattle, Washington where a surprise overview was delivered by Nintendo Developer Support staff [[Mark DeLoura]] about the 64DD.&lt;ref name="N64 Dev Conf 1997"/&gt;

=== Delays ===

The 64DD is notable in part for its multi-year period of many repeated launch delays, which created an interdependent cascade of delays and complications of many other business processes and product launches for Nintendo and its partners.&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Imagineer profile at IGN"&gt;{{cite web | title=Imagineer | publisher=IGN | url=http://www.ign.com/companies/imagineer | accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DD Date?"/&gt;

On May 30, 1997, Nintendo issued a press conference announcing the first in what would become a series of the product's launch delays, saying it had been rescheduled to March 1998, with no comment on an American release schedule. At that time, the delays were reportedly attributed to the protracted development of both the disks and the drive technologies.&lt;ref name="64DD delay at GameSpot"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo Says 64DD Delayed | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-says-64dd-delayed/1100-2466742/ | publisher=GameSpot | first=Chris | last=Johnston | date=May 30, 1997 | accessdate=September 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=64DD-Layed |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=97 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=August 1997|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 9, 1997, Nintendo and [[Alps Electric]] announced their manufacturing partnership for the still tentatively titled&lt;ref name="N64 Dev Conf 1997"/&gt; 64DD.&lt;ref name="Nintendo Alps 64DD"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo Teams Up with Alps on 64DD | publisher=IGN | date=June 9, 1997 | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1997/06/10/nintendo-teams-up-with-alps-on-64dd | accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box | align=right | width=25% | quote=We're hesitant to say [the status of the 64DD software lineup, but] if software doesn't come out consistently after we sell the 64DD, we'll be stuck.&lt;br&gt;Don't worry.

At the pre-[[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] press conference on June 18, 1997, the company lacked even a prototype unit to display while Howard Lincoln stated that the company wouldn't release the device until sufficient numbers of software titles support it.  Reportedly featuring at least twenty game titles in development including ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', the device still retained its projected Japanese launch window of March 1998, and received its first American launch window of early 1998.&lt;ref name="Donkey Kong 64 Jumps to DD"/&gt;  Also at the show, Nintendo's main game designer, [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], speculated that the first games to be released for the new system would be ''[[SimCity 64]]'', ''[[Mario Artist]]'', ''[[Pokémon|Pocket Monsters]]'', and ''[[EarthBound 64|Mother 3]]''.&lt;ref name="npinterview"&gt;{{Cite interview | first1=Takao | last1=Imamura | first2=Shigeru | last2=Miyamoto | magazine=Nintendo Power |date=August 1997 | title=Pak Watch E3 Report "The Game Masters" | pages=104–105 | publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box | align=right | width=25% | quote=[Nintendo can't guarantee that the 64DD will launch in the US in 1998], but what we can say is that it will launch when it is ready and when we have a compelling piece of software for it.

In a December 1997 interview with Shigeru Miyamoto and [[Shigesato Itoi]], Miyamoto confessed the inherent difficulty in repeatedly attempting to describe and justify the long-promised potential of the mysterious peripheral to a curious public.  He said that it "would have been easier to understand if the DD was already included when the N64 first came out. It’s getting harder to explain after the fact. (laughs)" To illustrate the fundamental significance of the 64DD to all game development at Nintendo, Itoi said, "I came up with a lot of ideas because of the 64DD. All things start with the 64DD. There are so many ideas I wouldn’t have been allowed to come up with if we didn’t have the 64DD."  Miyamoto concluded, "Almost every new project for the N64 is based on the 64DD. ... we’ll make the game on a cartridge first, then add the technology we’ve cultivated to finish it up as a full-out 64DD game."&lt;ref name="The 64Dream Dec 1997"&gt;{{ cite journal | title=A friendly discussion between the "Big 2" (translated text) | url=http://yomuka.wordpress.com/2013/03/29/itoi-miyamoto-interview-64dd/ | magazine=The 64 Dream| subjectlink1=Shigeru Miyamoto | subjectlink2=Shigesato Itoi | first1=Shigeru | last1=Miyamoto | first2=Shigesato | last2=Itoi | date=December 1997 | page=91 | accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998, IGN optimistically expected all major Nintendo 64 cartridge titles to have software support for an impending expansion disk.

On April 8, 1999, IGN announced Nintendo's latest delayed 64DD launch date as being June 1999.

By May 1999, the 64DD's launch was still withheld by the lack of completed launch software.&lt;ref name="64DD Makes an Appearance"/&gt;

As of August 1999's Space World event, Nintendo had set Randnet's launch date at December 1, 1999, but reportedly had not yet set a launch date for the 64DD.&lt;ref name="Inside Randnet"/&gt;

=== Launch ===

The 64DD was launched on December 1, 1999, in [[Japan]], as a package called the Randnet Starter Kit which includes six games bimonthly through the mail, and a year of Internet service.

Anticipating that its long-planned peripheral would become a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]], Nintendo initially sold the Randnet Starter Kit via mail order.&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"/&gt; Later, very limited quantities of the standalone 64DD and games were made available through stores.

=== Discontinuation ===

The discontinuation of the 64DD and Randnet was announced in October 2000, at a time when there were reportedly 15,000 subscribers.&lt;ref name="64Dream Feb 2001"/&gt; The hardware and online platforms were both discontinued in February 2001. Only nine official disks, including three third-party games and one Internet application suite, were released for it. Most planned 64DD games were either released as cartridge-based Nintendo 64 games as cartridge storage sizes had increased, ported to other consoles such as Nintendo's next-generation [[GameCube]] console, or canceled entirely.&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;

Nintendo designed the 64DD as an [[enabling technology]] for the development of new genres of games,&lt;ref name="The 64Dream Dec 1997"/&gt; which was principally accomplished by its three main design features: its dual storage strategy of cartridges and disks; its new [[real-time clock]] (RTC); and its Internet connectivity.&lt;ref name="Why Netscape Almost Never Happened"&gt;{{ cite web|title=Why Netscape Almost Never Happened |first=Emily |last=Rogers |date=July 13, 2012 |url=http://www.notenoughshaders.com/2012/07/13/why-netscape-almost-didnt-exist/ |publisher=Not Enough Shaders |accessdate=June 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314191929/http://www.notenoughshaders.com/2012/07/13/why-netscape-almost-didnt-exist/ |archivedate=March 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dual storage strategy of the Nintendo 64 plus the 64DD combines the traditional high speed cartridges, which are low-capacity, non-writable, and expensive but very fast along with the introduction of proprietary mass storage disks, which are large-capacity, rewritable, and cheap but only moderately fast.

Though incompatible in every way with any other consumer electronics product, the 64DD's magnetic storage technology resembles the generic [[floppy disk]], and the large and sturdy shell of the proprietary [[Zip disk]] for personal computers.&lt;ref name="The 64DD: Nintendo's Disk Drive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="What is the 64DD?"&gt;{{cite web | title=What is the 64DD? | publisher=IGN | date=September 17, 1997 | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1997/09/18/what-is-the-64dd | accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though various prominent sources have mistakenly referred to the medium as being [[magneto-optical drive|magneto-optical]] technology, Nintendo's own developer documentation refers to it in detail as being magnetic.&lt;ref name="N64 Dev Conf 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="N64 Introductory Manual"&gt;{{cite book | title=Nintendo 64 Introductory Manual | date=March 1999 | publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc. | url=http://n64.icequake.net/doc/n64intro/kantan/step1/index.html | accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iwata Asks OoT 3D"/&gt;{{rp|5}}  Complementing their proprietary and [[Nintendo 64 Game Pak#Copy protection|copy-protected]] cartridge strategy, the proprietary 64&amp;nbsp;MB disk format was Nintendo's faster, more flexible, and [[copyright infringement|copy-protected]] answer to the commodity [[Compact disc|Compact Disc]] format, which is cheaper to produce but is much slower, read-only, and easier to [[PlayStation (console)#Copy protection|copy]] on personal computers. The most advanced CD technology delivered by the contemporaneous [[Sega Saturn]] and [[Sony]] [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game consoles can hold at least 650&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte]]s (MB) of information with a peak 300&amp;nbsp;kB/s&lt;ref name="N64 Dev Conf 1997"/&gt; throughput and more than 200&amp;nbsp;[[Milisecond|ms]] seek speed. This compares to the Nintendo 64's [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]]'s 4 to 64&amp;nbsp;MB size and 5 to 50&amp;nbsp;MB/s&lt;ref name="N64 Programming Manual"/&gt; of low latency and instantaneous load times, and the 64DD's 64&amp;nbsp;MB disk size and 1&amp;nbsp;MB/s peak&lt;ref name="N64 Introductory Manual"/&gt; throughput with 75 ms average seek latency.&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt; The high seek latency and low maximum throughput of a 2x CD-ROM drive contribute to stuttering and to very long loading times throughout a gameplay session in many titles, in addition to a much higher production cost, testing cycle, and potential development time for all the potential extra content.&lt;ref name="F5 Interview Pt1"&gt;{{cite interview | title=Factor 5 Interview (Part I) | date=February 23, 1998 |first=Julian | last=Eggebrecht | subject-link=Julian Eggebrecht | interviewer=Peer Schneider | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1998/02/24/factor-5-interview-part-i | accessdate=January 13, 2015 | quote=We immediately liked the N64 because we didn't have to deal with CDs. You shouldn't underestimate what a battle it can be to make a CD game on the PlayStation. You have to fill it; you have to burn it — which takes an hour every time you want to see a new version of your game, you have to work around loading errors, and so on. CDs can be a real pain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of variable storage strategies, Nintendo determined that the development of ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'' would be retargeted from 64DD disk format alone, to the much faster cartridge format, for performance reasons.&lt;ref name="Iwata Asks OoT 3D"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/3ds/zelda-ocarina-of-time/ |title=Iwata Asks: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D |publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc. |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Similar in proportion of the historical comparison of [[Famicom Disk System]] floppy disks to early [[Famicom]] cartridges,&lt;ref name="Virtually Overlooked: Mario Artist"&gt;{{ cite web | title=Virtually Overlooked: Mario Artist | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/08/28/virtually-overlooked-mario-artist/ | date=August 28, 2008 | first=JC | last=Fletcher | accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; this disk format's initial design specifications had been set during a time frame when the initial Nintendo 64 cartridge size was 4&amp;nbsp;MB as with ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', and a 32&amp;nbsp;MB size eventually became popular over the years.  Nonetheless, the 64DD disk format would serve as significant storage size expansion upon its 1999 launch when 32&amp;nbsp;MB cartridges were the norm&lt;ref name="The 64DD: Nintendo's Disk Drive"/&gt; and on into future years when only three 64&amp;nbsp;MB cartridges would ever be released for Nintendo 64.  The medium's writability, up to 38&amp;nbsp;MB per disk,&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Nintendo 64: The Start of a Long Journey |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=30 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=June 1997|page=53 |url=https://archive.org/stream/NextGeneration30Jun1997/Next_Generation_30_Jun_1997#page/n54}}&lt;/ref&gt; would yield enduring benefits to game genre and social gaming like that of the Famicom Disk System.&lt;ref name="64DD at NWP"/&gt;

Many released Nintendo 64 cartridge games have been programmed to detect the presence of a 64DD drive and the game's corresponding optional expansion disk, most of which were never fully developed or ever released.  Without an expansion disk present, such a standalone game carries on.&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt; Depending on the game's specific capabilities, these expansions can provide extra levels, minigames, and can store personal and [[user-generated content]].&lt;ref name="GPro92"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Nintendo 'Bulks' Up N64 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=92 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1996|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any Nintendo 64 game which doesn't actively utilize the 64DD drive has potential access to only the few kilobytes of writable storage on the standard issue [[Nintendo 64 accessories#Controller Pak|Nintendo 64 Controller Pak]] and on some cartridges' internal battery backed storage, for storing only the player's basic progress and preferences.

In addition to writable storage, the real-time clock enables the existence of [[persistent world|persistent game worlds]] according to a real-world clock and calendar, backed by a battery even when the system's main power is shut off. Nintendo's lead game designer, [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], said this of the four-year development of the ultimately unreleased pet breeding game ''[[Cabbage (canceled video game)|Cabbage]]'': "We're doing it on the 64DD because I wanted to make a clock function, such that even if the power is cut, can still raise the creature."&lt;ref name="64DD: The Games"&gt;{{cite web | title=64DD: The Games | date=January 29, 1998 | author=IGN Staff | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1998/01/30/64dd-the-games | accessdate=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cabbage at IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/04/05/nintendo-still-cooking-cabbage |title=Nintendo Still Cooking Cabbage |publisher=IGN |date=April 4, 2000 |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modem cartridge is packaged with the system, allowing Internet connectivity through Randnet, in addition to the service's members-only portal sites.

The 64DD has a chip containing an enhanced font and audio [[Library (computing)|library]] for all software to share, further saving the potential available space of mass storage on cartridges and disks. The 64DD has a [[32-bit]] [[coprocessor]] to help it read disks and to transfer data to the main console. The main Nintendo 64 deck uses its [[RCP (chip)|RCP]] and [[NEC]] [[VR4300]] to process data from the top cartridge slot and the [[Input/output|I/O]] devices.  Like nearly all disc-based consoles, the 64DD can [[booting|boot]] up without a cartridge on the top deck, because it has a boot menu.  The 64DD is packaged with the 4&amp;nbsp;MB RAM [[Expansion Pak]], yielding a total of 8&amp;nbsp;MB.  The 64DD has its own [[software development kit]] that works in conjunction with the Nintendo 64 development kit.

===Accessories===
[[File:Nintendo-64-Memory-Expansion-Pak.jpg|thumb|The requisite 4MB RAM Expansion Pak is bundled with the 64DD.]]
The 64DD Randnet bundle includes a [[modem]] for connecting to the [[#Randnet|Randnet]] network and the 4MB RAM [[Expansion Pak]].

The Randnet service was accessible only via a Nintendo 64 and 64DD setup, and the 64DD hardware was only purchasable by Randnet subscribers — the peripheral was not stocked in any retail stores. The Randnet subscription service came bundled with the 64DD hardware and several games, purchased by filling out a mail order request form at select retail stores in Japan.&lt;ref name="64DD at NOM 2"&gt;{{cite web  | url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/9911/05/index.html | issue=15 | title=Nintendo Online Magazine | work=Nintendo Online Magazine | publisher=Nintendo Co., Ltd. | language=Japanese | accessdate=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan was available in two tiers: a purchase plan for users who want to buy only the 64DD to add to their existing Nintendo 64 system, and a rent-to-own plan for those who want both the 64DD and a special edition translucent black Nintendo 64 console.&lt;ref name="Ultimate 64DD FAQ"/&gt; Randnet was launched with monthly payment plans for the service and hardware bundle: ¥2,500 (approximately {{US$|23.50}}) per month for the purchase plan and ¥3,300 ({{USD|31}}) per month for rent-to-own for the first year and ¥1,500 per month for Randnet service thereafter.&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inside Randnet"&gt;{{cite web | title=Inside Randnet | date=August 27, 1999 | publisher=IGN | url=http://ign64.ign.com/news/9946.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020105102040/http://ign64.ign.com/news/9946.html | archivedate=January 5, 2002 | accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ultimate 64DD FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DD Pricing"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo Announces DD Pricing Plan | publisher=IGN | date=October 21, 1999 | url=http://ign64.ign.com/news/11411.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010417174726/http://ign64.ign.com/news/11411.html | archivedate=April 17, 2001 | accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="64DD at NOM 3"&gt;{{cite web  | url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/9911/03/index.html | issue=15 | title=Nintendo Online Magazine | work=Nintendo Online Magazine | publisher=Nintendo Co., Ltd. | language=Japanese | accessdate=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service later eliminated the monthly payment model in favor of an annual prepaid model, at ¥30,000 ({{USD|290}}) for one year for outright purchase and ¥39,600 ({{USD|380}}) for the first year of rent-to-own.&lt;ref name="Ultimate 64DD FAQ"/&gt; The 64DD and some later games eventually became available for purchase directly at retail.&lt;ref name="Ultimate 64DD FAQ"/&gt;

As part of the subscription, the game disks were delivered not in the initial package but by mail on a schedule: December 1999 had ''Doshin the Giant'' and ''Mario Artist: Paint Studio''; February 2000 had ''Randnet Disk'', ''SimCity 64'', and ''Mario Artist: Talent Studio''; and April 2000 had ''F-Zero X Expansion Kit'' and ''Mario Artist: Polygon Studio''.&lt;ref name="Ultimate 64DD FAQ"/&gt;  The final Starter Kit subscription title ''Polygon Studio'' was suddenly delayed&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon Studio Lives"&gt;{{cite web | title=Polygon Studio Lives | date=June 26, 2000 | publisher=IGN | url=http://ign64.ign.com/news/21398.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010619000502/http://ign64.ign.com/news/21398.html | archivedate=June 19, 2001 | accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then released on August 29, 2000.

[[File:Nintendo-64-Mouse.jpg|thumb|The Nintendo 64 mouse is bundled only with the ''Mario Artist: Paint Studio'' game for 64DD.]]
One of the most substantial series of games to include Randnet support is the ''Mario Artist'' series, which allowed online users to swap their artwork [[User-generated content|creations]] with others. Contests and other special events occurred periodically. Papercraft was implemented by way of modelling the characters in ''[[Mario Artist: Polygon Studio]]'' and utilizing ''[[Mario Artist: Communication Kit]]'' to upload the model data to Randnet's online printing service. The user can then cut, fold, and adhere the resulting colored paper into a full-bodied 3D [[papercraft]] figure.&lt;ref name="Virtually Overlooked: Mario Artist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon Studio at 64DD.net"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mario Artist: Polygon Studio | url=http://64dd.net/modules/games/?system=64dd&amp;type=released&amp;section=main&amp;id=7 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113081755/http://64dd.net/modules/games/?system=64dd&amp;type=released&amp;section=main&amp;id=7 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=January 13, 2014 | accessdate=June 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the 64DD hardware package was primarily sold with a mandatory subscription to Randnet, the service was fairly popular amongst the limited 64DD user base. Overall, the service didn't garner enough subscribers to justify its continued existence, and in October 2000, the service's impending closure was announced.  ''The 64 Dream'' magazine reported a Nintendo public relations statement, which said that there had been approximately 15,000 Randnet subscribers at the time of this announcement, indicating that there had been at least that many hardware units sold to customers.&lt;ref name="64Dream Feb 2001"/&gt; Nintendo offered to buy back all the Randnet related consumer hardware and to give free service to all users from the announcement of closure, until the day it actually went offline.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The Randnet service closed on February 28, 2001&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Randnet service termination"/&gt; and Nintendo's equity partnership with RandnetDD Co., Ltd. was liquidated from June 30, 2001&lt;ref name="Nintendo Consolidated 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | title=CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | publisher=Nintendo Co., Ltd | date=November 21, 2001 | location=Kyoto, Japan | url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2001/011121e.pdf | accessdate=November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} to  January 31, 2002.&lt;ref name="Nintendo Consolidated 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | title=CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | publisher=Nintendo Co., Ltd | date=May 30, 2002 | location=Kyoto, Japan | url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2002/020530e.pdf | accessdate=November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}

==Reception==
Rating the overall system at 6.0 out of 10.0, IGN's Peer Schneider finds the industrial design language of the 64DD and its accessories to perfectly match and integrate with that of the Nintendo 64, with no user-accessible moving parts, a single mechanical eject button, sharing the N64's power button, and child-friendly usability.  Installation is said to be "quick and painless", operation is "even simpler", and the whole system "couldn't be easier to use".  Software load times are described as "minimal", where the most complex possible point of the system's library reaches about five seconds.  The site says that the 64DD popularity was inherently limited, due in part to its limited release in Japan, a country which had a limited adoption of the Nintendo 64 and of dialup Internet connectivity.&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;

Schneider found the combination of the Randnet's web browser and the mouse to provide a "passable surfing experience".  He described the portal's private content as "much too limited", where "[a]nyone who has used the Internet would snicker at the lack of up-to-date contents or tools offered on Randnet". He was disappointed in the companies' failure to have ever delivered certain promised online features, such as game beta testing and music distribution.&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"&gt;{{cite web | title=64DD: Broken Promises | date=February 23, 2001 | publisher=IGN | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/02/24/64dd-broken-promises | accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it provides new users with a "simple network [which] functions as first baby steps into the vast world of the Internet".&lt;ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio (Import)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mario Artist: Paint Studio (Import) |first=Peer |last=Schneider |work=ign64 |date=August 22, 2000 |url=http://ign64.ign.com/reviews/1908.html |accessdate=June 30, 2016 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010330013031/http://ign64.ign.com/reviews/1908.html |archivedate=March 30, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schneider liked the overall product value provided by the Randnet Starter Kit, including hardware, games, accessories, and Internet subscription. However, the platform's abrupt discontinuation proved to limit the appeal to a per item basis rather than as a whole.  Because these items were sold only as a soon-discontinued bundle, all with such ultimately limited application, he found the disks' cheaper prices to be aggregated back up to the level of cartridges.&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"/&gt;

He found the ''Mario Artist'' series (especially the 64DD's "killer app", ''Talent Studio'') to be uniquely compelling in creative ways that "couldn't be done on any other gaming console on the market", utilizing the disks' writability and "[leaving] CD systems behind".&lt;ref name="Leaves CD Systems"/&gt; As a flagship title for the platform, IGN found ''Paint Studio''{{'}}s well-made art creation functionality to be both a low-cost paint program, and edutainment akin to an [[Adobe Photoshop]] for kids.&lt;ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio (Import)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio Review at IGN"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mario Artist: Paint Studio Review | publisher=IGN | url=http://www.ign.com/games/mario-artist-paint-studio/64dd-1908 | accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that If the platform hadn't been abruptly canceled, Nintendo supposedly would have utilized ''Paint Studio'' as a source of user-generated art content throughout a notable library of 64DD-compatible games.&lt;ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio (Import)"/&gt;

Schneider acknowledges Nintendo's vision, attributing the system's downfall generally upon the drastically changing marketplace during the several years of delays until the system's release.&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"/&gt; He summarized the 64DD as "an appealing creativity package"&lt;ref name="64DD: Broken Promises"/&gt; "targeted at a certain type of user"&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt; "that delivered a well-designed user-driven experience"—and a "limited online experiment at the same time", which partially fulfilled Nintendo president [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]]'s "longtime dream of a network that connects Nintendo consoles all across the nation".&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;

Nintendo reported that there were 15,000 Randnet subscribers as of the October 2000 announcement of the service's impending closure, with at least as many requisite 64DD units having been deployed.&lt;ref name="64Dream Feb 2001"/&gt;

===Legacy===

{{quote box | quoted=1 | border=none | align=right  |Don't worry.&lt;br&gt;Feel easy about the 64DD. —Miyamoto}}
New genres of games were developed due to the advent of 64DD's rewritable mass storage, real-time clock (RTC), and [[Internet appliance]] functionality.&lt;ref name="The 64Dream Dec 1997"/&gt; However, the system's [[list of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]] required many 64DD games to be released on traditional Nintendo 64 cartridges alone, ported to other consoles, or canceled.&lt;ref name="Everything about 64DD at IGN"/&gt;

Some of these standalone Nintendo 64 cartridge releases include the equivalent of the 64DD's RTC chip directly on board the cartridge, as with Japan's ''Animal Forest''.   The {{nowrap|4 MB}} RAM [[Nintendo 64 accessories#Expansion Pak|Expansion Pak]] became a sometimes mandatory staple of Nintendo 64 game development, being packaged along with a few cartridge games.  All subsequent Nintendo consoles would directly include RTC functionality.

The concept of the popular multiplatform ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' series originated with the 64DD's rewritable storage and RTC. The eventual initial release of the series was adapted to utilize only the Nintendo 64 cartridge format with an embedded RTC, in the form of Japan's ''Animal Forest''. That game was cosmetically adapted for GameCube (with the console's built-in RTC and its removable and rewritable [[Nintendo GameCube#Memory and storage|memory cards]]) with the new name of ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]''.  All games in the series are played in [[Real time (media)|real time]] [[persistent world|persistent game world]], with the passage of time being recorded on writable media.  The realtime effect reflects real [[season]]s, real [[holidays]], virtual plant growth, development of virtual relationships, and other events.  Interactivity between real human players on different subsequent console generations has been enabled through the swapping of various Nintendo consoles' writable mass storage cards or through [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection|online]] communications.&lt;ref name="IGN_GC_preview"&gt;{{cite web| title=Animal Crossing Preview |last=Schneider |first=Peer |url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/361/361068p1.html |date=May 30, 2002 |publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of what is now the ''Nintendogs'' series originated because of 64DD, in the form of a pet creature breeding prototype called ''Cabbage''. Never released, it had been codeveloped by [[Shigesato Itoi]] (designer of ''[[EarthBound]]''), [[Tsunekazu Ishihara]] (designer of ''[[Pokémon]]''), and [[Shigeru Miyamoto]].&lt;ref name="The 64Dream Dec 1997"/&gt; Its publicized four-year development was fundamentally enabled by the [[realtime clock]] and mass writability, where Miyamoto explained, "We're doing it on the 64DD because I wanted to make a clock function, such that even if the power is cut, [the game] can still raise the creature"&lt;ref name="Cabbage at IGN"/&gt; and with optionally purchasable enhancement data.&lt;ref name="64DD: The Games"/&gt; A subset of creature maintenance functionality is made portable on the Game Boy via the [[Nintendo 64 accessories#Transfer Pak|Transfer Pak]], to be synchronized back to the 64DD disk.&lt;ref name="64DD: The Games"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cabbage at IGN"/&gt; In 2006, Miyamoto concluded that "the conversations and design techniques that popped up when we were making ''Cabbage'' are, of course, connected to ''Nintendogs'' and other things that we're doing now."&lt;ref name="Miyamoto Opens Vault"/&gt;

The concept of a personal avatar creator app which had begun with prototypes for the Famicom was solidified in ''[[Mario Artist: Talent Studio]]'' and then has been seen on all subsequent Nintendo consoles. Those ''Talent Studio'' avatars can be imported into select 64DD titles including the ''[[SimCity 64]]'' game. Nintendo designer Yamashita Takayuki credits his work on ''Talent Studio'' as having been foundational to his conception and development of the entire [[Mii]] component of the [[Wii]] platform a decade later.&lt;ref name="Virtually Overlooked: Mario Artist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="64DD at NWP"&gt;{{cite web | title=Nintendo's Expansion Ports: Nintendo 64 Disk Drive | first=Danny | last=Bivens | date=October 29, 2011 | publisher=Nintendo World Report | url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/27670/nintendos-expansion-ports-nintendo-64-disk-drive | accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iwata Asks: Wii Sports"&gt;{{cite interview | title=Wii Sports | others=Satoru Iwata | first1=Katsuya | last1=Eguchi | first2=Keizo | last2=Ota | first3=Yoshikazu | last3=Yamashita | first4=Takayuki | last4=Shimamura | publisher=Nintendo | url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/wii_sports/ | accessdate=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="64DD English user document"&gt;{{cite web | title=64DD English (Engrish) user document | publisher=64DD Institute | url=http://ksnk.jp/ddlab/supp/en.html | accessdate=June 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mii Prototype Development History"&gt;{{youtube | title=Mii Prototype Development History From NES to Wii GCD 2007  | id=SbaNZ7IwrxY }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's concepts were reportedly specifically foundational to the characters in ''[[Wii Tennis]]''.&lt;ref name="Miyamoto Opens Vault"&gt;{{cite web | title=Miyamoto Opens the Vault | date=August 21, 2006 | first=Anoop | last=Gantayat | publisher=IGN | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/08/21/miyamoto-opens-the-vault | accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of graphical stamps that are seen in various [[Miiverse]]-supported games is found in ''Mario Artist: Paint Studio''&lt;ref name="Mario Artist: Paint Studio (Import)"/&gt; and ''[[Mario Paint]]''.

The user-creation of graphics, animations, levels, and minigames which are seen in the ''Mario Artist'' series and ''[[F-Zero X#Disk drive expansion|F-Zero X Expansion Kit]]'' are revisited in later console generations.  The idea of [[minigame]]s was popularized generally during the Nintendo 64's [[fifth generation video game consoles|fifth generation of video game consoles]]. Some early minigames can be actually created in ''Mario Artist: Polygon Studio'' in the style that would later be used in the ''[[WarioWare (series)|WarioWare]]'' series of games.&lt;ref name="64DD at NWP"/&gt;  Certain minigames literally originated there, as explained by Goro Abe of [[Nintendo Research &amp; Development 1|Nintendo R&amp;D1]]'s so-called Wario Ware All-Star Team: "In ''Polygon Studio'' you could create 3D models and animate them in the game, but there was also a side game included inside. In this game, you would have to play short games that came one after another. This is where the idea for ''Wario Ware'' came from."&lt;ref name="Nintendo RD1 Interview"&gt;{{ cite interview | publisher=Video Games Daily | title=Nintendo R&amp;D1 Interview | url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/ncl_nintendo_wwiv_apr06_p1.asp | date=April 7, 2006 | first1=Yoshio | last1=Sakamoto | first2=Ryuichi | last2=Nakada | first3=Ko | last3=Takeuchi | first4=Goro | last4=Abe | first5=Taku | last5=Sugioka | first6=Naoko | last6=Mori | accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4831">'''Alfred Hempel''' (1920&amp;ndash;1989) was a [[Germany|German]] businessman. He attracted international attention because of his trade and smuggling of materials used in nuclear facilities in [[Pakistan]], India, [[Argentina]] and several other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=3wUAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22Alfred+Hempel%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Alfred%20Hempel%22&amp;f=false Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: At your service], 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=BJm3e1jJvXcC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=%22Alfred+Hempel%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Alfred%20Hempel%22&amp;f=false Stopping the Spread of Nuclear Weapons: The Past and the Prospects], David Fischer, pp 138-140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=PbLddoNkxi4C&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22Alfred+Hempel%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Alfred%20Hempel%22&amp;f=false Nuclear Black Markets: Pakistan, A.Q.

During [[World War II]], Hempel received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] while serving as a battalion leader at [[Kolberg]], Pomerania.&lt;ref name="Scherzer p380"&gt;Scherzer 2007, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hempel came into the public spotlight after it was revealed in 1988 that he had smuggled Norwegian and Russian [[heavy water]] to India. This was used in one of the Indian [[Nuclear reactor|reactors]] used for the production of [[nuclear weapon]] material. The transfer happened in 1983, and was one of several such operations carried out by Hempel's network of companies.  In 1984 Hempel's company was accused by the U.S. Department of State of transferring nuclear technology and material to [[Libya]].&lt;ref name="MilhollinProliferation"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milhollin|first1=Gary|title=Bonn's Proliferation Policy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/04/opinion/bonn-s-proliferation-policy.html?mcubz=3|accessdate=6 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=4 January 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1994 and 1995, he is said to have arranged the shipment of gas centrifuge parts from Pakistan to Iran via Dubai.&lt;ref name="MilhollinNukesNazi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milholin|first1=Gary|title=Nukes 'R' Us (Opinion)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/04/opinion/nukes-r-us.html?mcubz=3&amp;_r=0|accessdate=6 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hempel's technique during this and other such operations was to apply for export of the heavy water to a country that already had such material, such as Germany, then divert the shipment to the real buyer.   He was involved in transfers of nuclear material from China, the U.S.S.R., and Norway to ultimate buyers including India, South Africa, and Argentina.&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickAssessmeent"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Mark|title=Nuclear Black Markets: Pakistan, A.Q.

'''Anton Eichleiter''' ({{lang-hu|Eichleiter Antal}}, [[Augsburg]], 1 March 1831 – [[Rorschach, Switzerland|Rorschach]], 31 May 1902) was a [[German people|German]] iron manufacturer, manager of the [[Ganz Works]].

==Life==
===Early years===
Eichleiter was born to a family originated in [[Augsburg]]. His parents were Andreas Eichleiter, teacher in the [[Lutheran]] [[Gymnasium bei St. Anna]], and Caroline Steinhard, daughter of a [[Lutheran]] priest. Eichleiter had eight siblings of whom three died in an early age and after his mother's death his father had to take care of them. After the primary school he went to an industrial and agricultural vocational school in Augsburg. Then he studied at the [[Augsburg University of Applied Sciences|Polytechnikum]] (today the [[Augsburg University of Applied Sciences]]).

===Budapest, Hungary===
After finishing his studies he worked first as a locksmith then as a technical drawer in [[Erfurt]], [[Thuringia]] at the main workshop of the [[Thüringer Bahn]]. In 1854 he was employed by the [[MAN SE|Cramer-Klett]] (predecessor of [[MAN SE]]) where he was commissioned to hand over the produced wagons to the 'Tisza Railway' (''Tiszai Vasút'') company in [[Szolnok]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. The wheels of these wagons were delivered by the [[Ganz Works]] based in [[Buda]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. He met the [[Swiss]]-born [[Hungary|Hungarian]] industrialist [[Ábrahám Ganz]] (father of the [[Ganz Works]]) there who offered him a job in his foundry. His first project was to create a new, bigger workshop. He designed the one-piece [[chill (casting)|chill]] casted peak inserts to the railway crossings. Beside his planner job he managed the correspondence with different railway companies.

One day his long time friend, [[András Mechwart]] visited him in [[Buda]]. [[Ábrahám Ganz]] offered Mechwart as well a job in his factory which he accepted. Mechwart was also a brother-in-law of Eichleiter, because Eichleiter's sister, Luise was the wife of Mechwart.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&amp;query=%2Bsurname%3Aeichleiter%20%2Bbirth_place%3Aaugsburg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his death Ganz concluded with Eichleiter, [[Ulrich Keller]] and Mechwart a secret, final agreement that stated, in the case of his unexpected death Eichleiter has to become the head of the company, Eichleiter gets 22% of the shares, Keller gets 10% and Mechwart 8% and his heirs living in [[Switzerland]] get the majority (the other 60%) of the shares and they cannot sell the company to outsiders for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gyartastrend.hu/muveltmernok/cikk/generaciovaltas_a_legendas_magyar_csaladi_vallalkozasokban]&lt;/ref&gt; So after Ganz's tragical death in 1867 Eichleiter, Mechwart and Keller became the manager of the [[Ganz Works]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganz-holding.hu/index.php/a-mult/98-a-mult/199-kiemelkedo-szemelyisegek]&lt;/ref&gt; They changed the name of the company to 'Ganz &amp; Co.'(''Ganz és Társa''). But after two years the heirs of Ganz sold the company to Eichleiter, Keller and Mechwart. They changed the name again in 1869, this time to 'Ganz &amp; Co. Foundry &amp; Machine Factory Inc.'(''Ganz és Társa Vasöntő és Gépgyár Rt.'') &lt;ref&gt;=[http://www.fokusz.info/index.php?cid=1224723513&amp;aid=1859909322]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 because of the crisis Eichleiter and Keller left the company and sold there shares. Mechwart became the head of the [[Ganz Works]].&lt;ref&gt;=[http://www.fokusz.info/index.php?cid=1224723513&amp;aid=1859909322]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eichleiter was a board member of the 'Pest-Buda Beauty Committee' (''Pest-Buda Szépészeti Bizottság'') which served as an architectural judging association. The members were nominated by the Hungarian government. He was also a member of the economic council of the Budapest-based 'First Hungarian Wagon Factory Inc.'(''Első Magyar Vasútikocsigyár Rt.''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://babud.mindenkilapja.hu/html/18580556/render/erdekesseg]&lt;/ref&gt; a technical advisor in a cornstarch producing company and in the [[Salgótarján]], [[Austria-Hungary]] based 'Salgótarján Coal Mine Ltd.' (''Salgótarjáni Szénbányamű''). Eichleiter was also an inspector and board member of the 'Commercial Bank of Buda' (''Budai Kereskedelmi Bank''). Later he became member of the exhibition committee of the [[1873 Vienna World's Fair|World's Fair in Vienna in 1873]], then correspondent and juror at the metal and machine department of the exhibition.

He was awarded the [[Order of Franz Joseph]] by the [[Austro-Hungarian]] emperor, [[Franz Joseph]] for his efforts in the industry development on the [[1873 Vienna World's Fair|World's Fair in Vienna in 1873]]. He was also honored by the Turkish sultan [[Abdülaziz I]] with the 'Medjedich Orden'.

===Switzerland===
All these rolles{{clarify|date=April 2017}} and workes tuckered{{clarify|date=April 2017}} him and made him ill, so he went to [[Thusis]], [[Switzerland]] to relax. At that time he suffered in acute [[gastritis]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. So he decided to change his way of life and move to [[Rorschach, Switzerland|Rorschach]] am [[Bodensee]], [[Canton of St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]] where he bought the 'Weinhalde Villa'.

In 1871/72 he co-financed the establishment of a new girl's school in the Canton of St. Gallen. He financed, designed and built for the public two school buildings as well. He supported a lot of charity project in Rorschach: theatre, gymnastics association, well drilling for the public etc.

In 1879 he became school counselor, then the head of the school council, then Swiss citizen and honorary citizen of Rorschach.

In 1887 the Swiss parliament wanted to pass a new federal patent law. But in the last three decades the people repeatedly rejected it at the refenda. However, in other developed countries that kind of law already existed at that time and therefore the Swiss intellectual treasure was easier to get stolen. So the federal president of the republic, [[Numa Droz]] took the matter in his hand. He encouraged the communities to establish local pantent committees. Eichleichter became the president of the [[Canton of St. Gallen]]'s committee, then member of the federal committee in [[Bern]] which looked after every single patent cases of Switzerland. And he also helped in the wording of the new federal patent law and lobbied for that. The new law passed by the parliament and people also voted for that, so it came into force in the same year.

After all their children left family nest, Eichleiter sold his house and moved to [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]]. But he died on 31 May 1902 in [[Canton of St. Gallen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hvsg.ch/pdf/Njbl-HVSG_1g_Q.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
On 9 June 1956 he married Doris Wundsch, daughter of a [[Lutheran]] priest of [[Erfurt]].Their first child, Friederike was born on 24 June 1857. Then came Hermann and Emil who both died in a young age. Then in 1864 Anna was born, then Julius (28 May 1866), Bernhard (21 December 1867) and Fritz (28 Januar 1869) came later. Anna, Emil and Friederike suffered in [[meningitis basilaris]].

Luise Eichleiter, Antal's sister was the wife of [[András Mechwart]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&amp;query=%2Bsurname%3Amechwart%20%2Bbirth_place%3Aschweinfurt~]&lt;/ref&gt;

Friederike Eichleiter, Antal's sister was the wife [[Julius Gulden]]. Gulden was an old friend of Eichleiter. Eichleiter asked Ganz to hire Gulden as a mechanical engineer in the [[Ganz Works]] like Mechwart. His professional field was the turbine construction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/ORSZ_KOZL_TechnTortSzle_21/?pg=152&amp;layout=s&amp;query=eichleiter]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Australia This Week''''' was a television [[business]] [[news program]] that aired on Friday and across the [[weekend]] on [[CNBC Asia]]. When [[daylight saving time]] is in effect in Australia, the program was first shown live across the network's pan-[[Asia]]n feed at 5pm [[Sydney]] time (2pm [[Singapore]]/[[Hong Kong]]/[[Taiwan]] time). At other times, the program was relayed live in Australia only, and rebroadcast 30 minutes later (3:30pm in the [[UTC+8]] time zone) on the channel's pan-[[Asia]]n feed. It was produced from CNBC Asia's Australia studio in [[Sydney]], and anchored by [[Oriel Morrison]].

The program served as a review of the week's trading in Australia, featuring analysis from money managers and [[investor]]s and excerpts from the major interviews from the week's editions of ''[[Squawk Australia]]'' and ''[[Trading Matters]]''. ''Australia This Week'' premiered on CNBC Asia on 6 October 2007 as part of a major push into the Australian market by the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55014">'''Business valuation''' is a process and a set of procedures used to estimate the [[valuation (finance)|economic value]] of an owner's interest in a business.  [[Valuation (finance)|Valuation]] is used by financial market participants 
to determine the price they are willing to pay or receive to effect a sale of a business.  In addition to estimating the selling price of a business, the same valuation tools are often used by business appraisers to resolve disputes related to estate and gift taxation, divorce litigation, allocate business purchase price among business assets, establish a formula for estimating the value of partners' ownership interest for buy-sell agreements, and many other business and legal purposes such as in shareholders deadlock, divorce litigation and estate contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kwok|first=Benny K. B. |title=Forensic Accountancy (2nd edition) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tfg8twAACAAJ|year=2008|publisher=LexisNexis|isbn=978-962-8972-76-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, the court would appoint a forensic accountant as the joint expert doing the business valuation.

== Standard and premise of value ==
{{see also|Business valuation standard}}
Before the value of a business can be measured, the valuation assignment must specify the reason for and circumstances surrounding the [http://bvint.com/ business valuation]. These are formally known as the business value standard and premise of value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pratt | first = Shannon | authorlink =  |author2=Robert F. Reilly |author3=Robert P. Schweihs   | title = Valuing a Business | publisher = McGraw Hill | series = McGraw-Hill Professional  | year = 2000  | doi =   | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WO6wd8O8dsUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=shannon+pratt&amp;ei=fcfUR6q-F4TCyQSrxfWABA&amp;sig=Fpqt8pGRjbLPZJ9e_QEQGFzQ7y0#PPA913,M1  | isbn = 0-07-135615-0 }} hmegrii
&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard of value is the hypothetical conditions under which the business will be valued.  The premise of value relates to the assumptions, such as assuming that the business will continue forever in its current form (going concern), or that the value of the business lies in the proceeds from the sale of all of its assets minus the related debt (sum of the parts or assemblage of business assets).

== Standards of value ==

* Fair market value – a value of a business enterprise determined between a willing buyer and a willing seller both in full knowledge of all the relevant facts and neither compelled to conclude a transaction.
* Investment value – a value the company has to a particular investor. Note that the effect of synergy is included in valuation under the investment standard of value.
* Intrinsic value – the measure of business value that reflects the investor's in-depth understanding of the company's economic potential.

==Premises of value==

* Going Concern – Value in continued use as an ongoing operating business enterprise.
* Assemblage of assets – value of assets in place but not used to conduct business operations.
* Orderly disposition – value of business assets in exchange, where the assets are to be disposed of individually and not used for business operations. 
* Liquidation – value in exchange when business assets are to be disposed of in a forced liquidation.

Premise of value for fair value Calculation

* In use – If the asset would provide maximum value to the market participants principally through its use in combination with other assets as a group.
* In Exchange – If the asset would provide maximum value to the market participants principally on a stand-alone basis. 
Business valuation results can vary considerably depending upon the choice of both the standard and premise of value.  In an actual business sale, it would be expected that the buyer and seller, each with an incentive to achieve an optimal outcome, would determine the fair market value of a business asset that would compete in the market for such an acquisition.  If the synergies are specific to the company being valued, they may not be considered.  Fair value also does not incorporate discounts for lack of control or marketability.

Note, however, that it is possible to achieve the fair market value for a business asset that is being liquidated in its secondary market. This underscores the difference between the standard and premise of value.

These assumptions might not, and probably do not, reflect the actual conditions of the market in which the subject business might be sold. However, these conditions are assumed because they yield a uniform standard of value, after applying generally accepted valuation techniques, which allows meaningful comparison between businesses which are similarly situated.

== Elements of business valuation ==

=== Economic conditions ===

{{Globalize/US|date=March 2011}}

A business valuation report generally begins with a summary of the purpose and scope of business appraisal as well as its date and stated audience. What follows is a description of national, regional and local economic conditions existing as of the valuation date, as well as the conditions of the industry in which the subject business operates.
A common source of economic information for the first section of the business valuation report is the Federal Reserve Board's [[Beige Book]], published eight times a year by the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]. State governments and industry associations also publish useful statistics describing regional and industry conditions.

=== Financial analysis ===
The [[financial statement analysis]] generally involves common size analysis, [[financial ratio|ratio analysis]] (liquidity, turnover, profitability, etc.), trend analysis and industry comparative analysis.  This permits the valuation analyst to compare the subject company to other businesses in the same or similar industry, and to discover trends affecting the company and/or the industry over time. By comparing a company's [[financial statements]] in different time periods, the valuation expert can view growth or decline in revenues or expenses, changes in capital structure, or other financial trends.  How the subject company compares to the industry will help with the risk assessment and ultimately help determine the discount rate and the selection of market multiples.

It is important to mention that among the financial statements, the primary statement to show the liquidity of the company is cash flow.
Cash flow shows the company's cash in and out flow.

=== Normalization of financial statements ===
The key objective of normalization is to identify the ability of the business to generate income for its owners. A measure of the income is the amount of cash flow that the owners can remove from the business without adversely affecting its operations. The most common normalization adjustments fall into the following four categories:
* Comparability Adjustments. The valuer may adjust the subject company's [[financial statements]] to facilitate a comparison between the subject company and other businesses in the same industry or geographic location. These adjustments are intended to eliminate differences between the way that published industry data is presented and the way that the subject company's data is presented in its [[financial statements]].
* Non-operating Adjustments. It is reasonable to assume that if a business were sold in a hypothetical sales transaction (which is the underlying premise of the [[fair market value]] standard), the seller would retain any assets which were not related to the production of earnings or price those non-operating assets separately. For this reason, non-operating assets (such as excess cash) are usually eliminated from the balance sheet.
* Non-recurring Adjustments. The subject company's financial statements may be affected by events that are not expected to recur, such as the purchase or sale of assets, a lawsuit, or an unusually large revenue or expense. These non-recurring items are adjusted so that the [[financial statements]] will better reflect the management's expectations of future performance.
* Discretionary Adjustments. The owners of private companies may be paid at variance from the market level of compensation that similar executives in the industry might command. In order to determine [[fair market value]], the owner's compensation, benefits, perquisites and distributions must be adjusted to industry standards. Similarly, the rent paid by the subject business for the use of property owned by the company's owners individually may be scrutinized.

=== Income, asset and market approaches ===
Three different approaches are commonly used in business valuation: the income approach, the asset-based approach, and the market approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valuadder.com/valuationguide/business-valuation-three-approaches.html Economic Principles behind the Market, Asset and Income Approaches]&lt;/ref&gt; Within each of these approaches, there are various techniques for determining the value of a business using the definition of value appropriate for the appraisal assignment. Generally, the income approaches determine value by calculating the [[net present value]] of the benefit stream generated by the business (discounted cash flow); the asset-based approaches determine value by adding the sum of the parts of the business (net asset value); and the market approaches determine value by comparing the subject company to other companies in the same industry, of the same size, and/or within the same region. A number of business valuation models can be constructed that utilize various methods under the three business valuation approaches. Venture Capitalists and Private Equity professionals have long used the [[First chicago method]] which essentially combines the income approach with the market approach.

In certain cases equity may also be valued by applying the techniques and frameworks developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], via a [[real options]] framework,&lt;ref name="Damodaran"/&gt; as discussed [[Business valuation#Option pricing approaches|below]].

In determining which of these approaches to use, the valuation professional must exercise discretion. Each technique has advantages and drawbacks, which must be considered when applying those techniques to a particular subject company. Most treatises and court decisions encourage the valuator to consider more than one technique, which must be reconciled with each other to arrive at a value conclusion. A measure of common sense and a good grasp of mathematics is helpful.

== Income approach ==
The income approach relies upon the economic principle of expectation: the value of business is based on the expected economic benefit and level of risk associated with the investment. Income based valuation methods determine [[fair market value]] by dividing the benefit stream generated by the subject or target company times a discount or capitalization rate. The discount or capitalization rate converts the stream of benefits into [[present value]]. There are several different income methods, including capitalization of earnings or [[cash flow]]s, discounted future cash flows ("[[discounted cash flow|DCF]]"), and the excess earnings method (which is a hybrid of asset and income approaches). The result of a value calculation under the income approach is generally the [[fair market value]] of a controlling, marketable interest in the subject company, since the entire benefit stream of the subject company is most often valued, and the capitalization and discount rates are derived from statistics concerning public companies.  [http://www.medlawplus.com/library/legal/irsrulings/revruling59-60.htm IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60] states that earnings are preeminent for the valuation of closely held operating companies.

However, income valuation methods can also be used to establish the value of a severable business asset as long as an income stream can be attributed to it. An example is licensable intellectual property whose value needs to be established to arrive at a supportable royalty structure.

=== Discount or capitalization rates ===
A [[Discounted cash flow|discount rate]] or [[capitalization rate]] is used to determine the [[present value]] of the [[expected return]]s of a business. The discount rate and [[capitalization rate]] are closely related to each other, but distinguishable. Generally speaking, the discount rate or [[capitalization rate]] may be defined as the yield necessary to attract investors to a particular investment, given the risks associated with that investment.

* In [[discounted cash flow|DCF]] valuations, the discount rate, often an estimate of the [[cost of capital]] for the business, is used to calculate the [[net present value]] of a series of projected [[cash flow]]s. The discount rate can also be viewed as the required rate of return the investors expect to receive from the business enterprise, given the level of risk they undertake.
* On the other hand, a capitalization rate is applied in methods of business valuation that are based on business data for a single period of time.  For example, in real estate valuations for properties that generate [[cash flow]]s, a [[capitalization rate]] may be applied to the net operating income (NOI) (i.e., income before depreciation and interest expenses) of the property for the trailing twelve months.

There are several different methods of determining the appropriate discount rates. The discount rate is composed of two elements: (1) the [[Risk-free interest rate|risk-free rate]], which is the return that an investor would expect from a secure, practically risk-free investment, such as a high quality government bond; plus (2) a [[risk premium]] that compensates an investor for the relative level of risk associated with a particular investment in excess of the risk-free rate. Most importantly, the selected discount or capitalization rate must be consistent with stream of benefits to which it is to be applied.

Capitalization and discounting valuation calculations become mathematically equivalent under the assumption that the business income grows at a constant rate.

==== Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) ====
The [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM) provides one method of determining a discount rate in business valuation. The [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] originated from the Nobel Prize-winning studies of Harry Markowitz, James Tobin, and William Sharpe. The method derives the discount rate by adding risk premium to the risk-free rate. The risk premium is derived by multiplying the equity risk premium with "beta", a measure of stock price volatility. Beta is compiled by various researchers for particular industries and companies, and measures systematic risks of investment.

One of the criticisms of the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] is that beta is derived from volatility of prices of publicly traded companies, which differ from non-publicly companies in liquidity, marketability, capital structures and control. Other aspects such as access to credit markets, size, and management depth are generally different, too. The rate build-up method also requires an assessment of the subject company's risk, which provides valuation of itself.  Where a privately held company can be shown to be sufficiently similar to a public company, the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] may be suitable. However, it requires the knowledge of market stock prices for calculation. For private companies that do not sell stock on the public capital markets, this information is not readily available. Therefore, calculation of beta for private firms is problematic. The build-up cost of capital model is the typical choice in such cases.

===== Alternative valuation approaches and factor models =====
With regard to capital market-oriented valuation approaches there are numerous valuation approaches besides the traditional CAPM model. They include, for example, the [[Arbitrage pricing theory]] (APT) as well as the [[Consumption-based capital asset pricing model|Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model]] (CCAPM). Furthermore, alternative capital market models were developed, having in common that expected return hinge on ''multiple'' risk sources and thus being less restrictive:

* Models of the Q theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Chu|date=2009|title=On the explanatory power of firm-specific variables in cross-sections of expected returns|url=|journal=Journal of Empirical Finance|volume=|pages=306-317|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fama–French three-factor model]]
* [[Carhart four-factor model]]
* Fama-French five-factor model

Nevertheless, even these models are not wholly consistent, as they also show [[market anomalies]]. However, the method of incomplete replication and risk covering come along without the need of capital market data and thus being more solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleißner Werner|first=Gregor Dorfleitner|date=2016|title=Valuing streams of risky cash flows with risk-value models|url=|journal=Journal of Risk|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally notable is the existence of investment based approaches, considering different investment opportunities and determining an investment program by means of linear optimization. Among them the approximative decomposition valuation approach can be found.

====Modified Capital Asset Pricing Model====
The Cost of Equity (Ke) is computed by using the Modified Capital Asset Pricing Model (Mod. CAPM)

&lt;math&gt;k_e  = R_f + \beta ( R_m-R_f) + SCRP + CSRP  &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;R_f&lt;/math&gt;   =   Risk free rate of return (Generally taken as 10-year Government  Bond Yield)

&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;   =   Beta Value (Sensitivity of the stock returns to market returns)

&lt;math&gt;k_e&lt;/math&gt;   =   Cost of Equity

&lt;math&gt;R_m&lt;/math&gt;   =    Market Rate of Return

SCRP = Small Company Risk Premium

CSRP= Company specific Risk premium

==== Weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") ====
The [[weighted average cost of capital]] is an approach to determining a discount rate. The [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] method determines the subject company's actual [[cost of capital]] by calculating the weighted average of the company's [[interest (finance)|cost of debt]] and cost of [[stock|equity]]. The [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] must be applied to the subject company's net [[cash flow]] to total invested capital.

One of the problems with this method is that the valuator may elect to calculate [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] according to the subject company's existing [[capital structure]], the average industry [[capital structure]], or the optimal capital structure. Such discretion detracts from the objectivity of this approach, in the minds of some critics.

Indeed, since the [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] captures the risk of the subject business itself, the existing or contemplated capital structures, rather than industry averages, are the appropriate choices for business valuation.

Once the [[capitalization rate]] or discount rate is determined, it must be applied to an appropriate economic income stream: pretax [[cash flow]], aftertax [[cash flow]], pretax [[net income]], after tax [[net income]], excess earnings, projected [[cash flow]], etc. The result of this formula is the indicated value before discounts. Before moving on to calculate discounts, however, the valuation professional must consider the indicated value under the asset and market approaches.

Careful matching of the discount rate to the appropriate measure of economic income is critical to the accuracy of the business valuation results. Net [[cash flow]] is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, the discount rates are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.

==== Build-Up Method ====
The Build-Up Method is a widely recognized method of determining the after-tax net cash flow discount rate, which in turn yields the capitalization rate. The figures used in the Build-Up Method are derived from various sources. This method is called a "build-up" method because it is the sum of risks associated with various classes of assets. It is based on the principle that investors would require a greater return on classes of assets that are more risky. The first element of a Build-Up capitalization rate is the risk-free rate, which is the rate of return for long-term government bonds. Investors who buy large-cap equity stocks, which are inherently more risky than long-term government bonds, require a greater return, so the next element of the Build-Up method is the equity risk premium. In determining a company's value, the long-horizon equity risk premium is used because the Company's life is assumed to be infinite. The sum of the risk-free rate and the equity risk premium yields the long-term average market rate of return on large public company stocks.

Similarly, investors who invest in small cap stocks, which are riskier than blue-chip stocks, require a greater return, called the "size premium." Size premium data is generally available from two sources: [[Morningstar, Inc.|Morningstar]]'s (formerly [[Roger G. Ibbotson|Ibbotson]] &amp; Associates') Stocks, Bonds, Bills &amp; Inflation and [[Duff &amp; Phelps]]' Risk Premium Report.

By adding the first three elements of a Build-Up discount rate, we can determine the rate of return that investors would require on their investments in small public company stocks. These three elements of the Build-Up discount rate are known collectively as the "systematic risks." This type of investment risk cannot be avoided through portfolio diversification. It arises from external factors and affect every type of investment in the economy. As a result, investors taking systematic risk are rewarded by an additional premium.

In addition to systematic risks, the discount rate must include "unsystematic risk" representing that portion of total investment risk that can be avoided through diversification. Public capital markets do not provide evidence of unsystematic risk since investors that fail to diversify cannot expect additional returns.

Unsystematic risk falls into two categories. One of those categories is the "industry risk premium". It is also known as [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] and can be observed by studying the returns of a group of companies operating in the same industry sector.  Morningstar's yearbooks contain empirical data to quantify the risks associated with various industries, grouped by SIC industry code.

The other category of unsystematic risk is referred to as "company specific risk." Historically, no published data has been available to quantify specific company risks. However, as of late 2006, new research has been able to quantify, or isolate, this risk for publicly traded stocks through the use of Total Beta calculations.  P. Butler and K. Pinkerton have outlined a procedure which sets the following two equations together:

Total Cost of Equity (TCOE) = risk-free rate + total beta*equity risk premium
TCOE = risk-free rate + beta*equity risk premium + size premium + company-specific risk premium

The only unknown in the two equations is the company specific risk premium.

While it is possible to isolate the company-specific risk premium as shown above, many appraisers just key in on the total cost of equity (TCOE) provided by the following equation: TCOE = risk-free rate + Total beta*equity risk premium.

It is similar to using the market approach in the income approach instead of adding separate (and potentially redundant) measures of risk in the build-up approach.  The use of total beta (developed by Aswath Damodaran) is a relatively new concept.  It is, however, gaining acceptance in the business valuation community since it is based on modern portfolio theory.  Total beta can help appraisers develop a cost of capital who were content to use their intuition alone when previously adding a purely subjective company-specific risk premium in the build-up approach.

It is important to understand why this capitalization rate for small, privately held companies is significantly higher than the return that an investor might expect to receive from other common types of investments, such as money market accounts, mutual funds, or even real estate. Those investments involve substantially lower levels of risk than an investment in a closely held company. Depository accounts are insured by the federal government (up to certain limits); mutual funds are composed of publicly traded stocks, for which risk can be substantially minimized through portfolio diversification.

[[closely held company|Closely held companies]], on the other hand, frequently fail for a variety of reasons too numerous to name. Examples of the risk can be witnessed in the storefronts on every Main Street in America. There are no federal guarantees. The risk of investing in a private company cannot be reduced through diversification, and most businesses do not own the type of hard assets that can ensure capital appreciation over time. This is why investors demand a much higher return on their investment in closely held businesses; such investments are inherently much more risky.  (This paragraph is biased, presuming that by the mere fact that a company is closely held, it is prone towards failure.)

== Asset-based approaches ==
The value of asset-based analysis of a business is equal to the sum of its parts. That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to business valuation. The asset approach to business valuation reported on the books of the subject company at their acquisition value, net of depreciation where applicable. These values must be adjusted to [[fair market value]] wherever possible.
The value of a company's intangible assets, such as goodwill, is generally impossible to determine apart from the company's overall [[enterprise value]]. For this reason, the asset-based approach is not the most probative method of determining the value of going business concerns. In these cases, the asset-based approach yields a result that is probably lesser than the [[fair market value]] of the business.
In considering an asset-based approach, the valuation professional must consider whether the shareholder whose interest is being valued would have any authority to access the value of the assets directly. Shareholders own shares in a corporation, but not its assets, which are owned by the corporation. A controlling shareholder may have the authority to direct the corporation to sell all or part of the assets it owns and to distribute the proceeds to the shareholder(s). The non-controlling shareholder, however, lacks this authority and cannot access the value of the assets. As a result, the value of a corporation's assets is not the true indicator of value to a shareholder who cannot avail himself of that value. The asset based approach is the entry barrier value and should preferably to be used in businesses having mature or declining growth cycle and is more suitable for capital intensive industry.

Adjusted [[book value|net book value]] may be the most relevant standard of value where liquidation is imminent or ongoing; where a company earnings or cash flow are nominal, negative or worth less than its assets; or where [[book value|net book value]] is standard in the industry in which the company operates. The adjusted [[book value|net book value]] may also be used as a "sanity check" when compared to other methods of valuation, such as the income and market approaches...

== Market approaches ==
{{main|Valuation using multiples}}

The market approach to business valuation is rooted in the economic principle of competition: that in a free market the supply and demand forces will drive the price of business assets to a certain equilibrium. Buyers would not pay more for the business, and the sellers will not accept less, than the price of a comparable business enterprise. The buyers and sellers are assumed to be equally well informed and acting in their own interests to conclude a transaction. It is similar in many respects to the "comparable sales" method that is commonly used in [[real estate appraisal]]. The market price of the stocks of publicly traded companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business, whose shares are actively traded in a free and open market, can be a valid indicator of value when the transactions in which stocks are traded are sufficiently similar to permit meaningful comparison.

The difficulty lies in identifying public companies that are sufficiently comparable to the subject company for this purpose. Also, as for a [[private company]], the equity is less liquid (in other words its stocks are less easy to buy or sell) than for a [[public company]], its value is considered to be slightly lower than such a [[market-based valuation]] would give.

When there is a lack of comparison with direct competition, a meaningful alternative could be a vertical value-chain approach where the subject company is compared with, for example, a known downstream industry to have a good feel of its value by building useful correlations with its downstream companies. Such comparison often reveals useful insights which help business analysts better understand performance relationship between the subject company and its downstream industry. For example, if a growing subject company is in an industry more concentrated than its downstream industry with a high degree of interdependence, one should logically expect the subject company performs better than the downstream industry in terms of growth, margins and risk.

=== Guideline Public Company method ===
Guideline Public Company method entails a [[Comparable company analysis|comparison]] of the subject company to [[publicly traded companies]]. The [[Comparable company analysis|comparison]] is generally based on published data regarding the public companies' stock price and earnings, sales, or revenues, which is expressed as a fraction known as a "multiple." If the guideline public companies are sufficiently similar to each other and the subject company to permit a meaningful comparison, then their multiples should be similar. The public companies identified for comparison purposes should be similar to the subject company in terms of industry, product lines, market, growth, margins and risk.

However, if the subject company is privately owned, its value must be adjusted for lack of marketability. This is usually represented by a discount, or a percentage reduction in the value of the company when compared to its publicly traded counterparts. This reflects the higher risk associated with holding stock in a private company. The difference in value can be quantified by applying a discount for lack of marketability. This discount is determined by studying prices paid for shares of ownership in private companies that eventually offer their stock in a public offering. Alternatively, the lack of marketability can be assessed by comparing the prices paid for restricted shares to fully marketable shares of stock of public companies.

==Option pricing approaches==
[[Business valuation#Income.2C asset and market approaches|As above]], in certain cases equity may be valued by applying the techniques and frameworks developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], via a [[real options]] framework.&lt;ref name="Damodaran"&gt;[[Aswath Damodaran]] ([[Stern School of Business]]):  [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/lectures/opt.html Applications Of Option Pricing Theory To Equity Valuation] and [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/optequity.pdf Option Pricing Applications in Valuation].&lt;/ref&gt; For general discussion as to context see [[Corporate finance#Valuing flexibility|#"Valuing flexibility"]] under [[corporate finance]], and [[Contingent claim valuation]]; for detail as to applicability and other considerations see [[Real options valuation#Limitations|#"Limitations"]] under [[real options valuation]].

In general, equity may be viewed as a [[call option]] on the firm,&lt;ref name ="Black-Scholes"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities|last=Black|first=Fischer|author2=Myron Scholes|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=1973|volume=81|issue=3|pages=637–654|doi=10.1086/260062}} [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831029]&lt;/ref&gt; and this allows for the valuation of troubled firms which may otherwise be difficult to analyse.&lt;ref name="Damodaran2"&gt;Aswath Damodaran (Stern School of Business):  [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/Seminars/AIMR3.pdf Valuing Firms in Distress].&lt;/ref&gt;  The classic application of this approach is to the valuation of [[distressed securities]], already discussed in the original [[Black-Scholes]] paper.&lt;ref name ="Black-Scholes"/&gt; Here, since the principle of [[limited liability]] protects equity investors, shareholders would choose not to repay the firm's debt where the value of the firm (as perceived) is less than the value of the outstanding debt; see [[bond valuation]]. Of course, where firm value is greater than debt value, the shareholders would choose to repay (i.e. [[Exercise (options)|exercise their option]]) and not to [[liquidate]]. Thus analogous to [[out the money]] options which nevertheless have value, equity will (may) have value even if the value of the firm falls (well) below the face value of the outstanding debt—and this value can (should) be determined using the appropriate [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|option valuation technique]]. (A further application of this principle is the analysis of [[principal–agent problem]]s;&lt;ref name="Damodaran"/&gt; see [[Principal–agent problem#Contract design|contract design]] under [[principal–agent problem]].)

Certain business situations, and the parent firms in those cases, are also logically analysed under an options framework; see [[Real options valuation#Further reading|"Applications"]] under the [[Real options valuation]] references. Just as a financial option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at a given price, companies that make strategic investments have the right, but not the obligation, to exploit opportunities in the future; management will of course only exercise where this makes economic sense. Thus, for companies facing uncertainty of this type, the stock price may (should) be seen as the sum of the value of existing businesses (i.e., the [[discounted cash flow|discounted cash flow value]]) plus any real option value.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Rappaport and [[Michael Mauboussin]] ([[Columbia Business School]]): [http://www.expectationsinvesting.com/tutorial11.shtml How Do You Assess The Value of A Company's "Real Options"?]&lt;/ref&gt; Equity valuations here, may (should) thus proceed likewise. Compare [[Price–earnings ratio#PVGO|PVGO]].

A common application is to [[natural resource]] investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Michael Brennan (finance) |last=Brennan |first=J. |authorlink2=Eduardo Schwartz |last2=Schwartz |first2=E. |jstor=2352967 |title=Evaluating Natural Resource Investments |journal=[[The Journal of Business]] |volume=58 |issue=2 |year=1985 |pages=135–157 |doi=10.1086/296288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, the [[underlying|underlying asset]] is the resource itself; the value of the asset is a function of both quantity of resource available and the [[Commodity market|price of the commodity in question]].  The value of the resource is then the difference between the value of the asset and the cost associated with [[Underground mining (hard rock)#Development mining vs. production mining|developing the resource]]. Where positive ("[[in the money]]") management will undertake the development, and will not do so otherwise, and a resource project is thus effectively a [[call option]].  A [[:Category:Mining companies|resource firm]] may (should) therefore also be analysed using the options approach. Specifically, the value of the firm comprises the value of already active projects determined via DCF valuation (or [[Outline of finance#Valuation|other standard techniques]]) and undeveloped reserves as analysed using the [[real options]] framework. See [[Mineral economics]].

Product [[patents]] may also be valued as options, and the value of firms holding these patents — typically firms in the [[:Category:Biotechnology companies|bio-science]], [[:Category:Technology companies|technology]],  and [[:Category:Pharmaceutical companies|pharmaceutical]] sectors — can (should) similarly be viewed as the sum of the value of products in place and the portfolio of patents yet to be deployed.&lt;ref&gt;P. Alonso, V. Azofra, and G. de la Fuente. (2006). [https://uam.academia.edu/PablodeAndr%C3%9EesAlonso/Papers/811295/The_real_options_component_of_firm_market_value_The_case_of_the_technological_corporation  The real options component of firm market value: The case of the technological corporation] ; A. Buckley,  K. Tse, H. Rijken and  H. Eijgenhuijsen. (2002). [http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/eurman/v20y2002i5p512-526.html Stock Market Valuation with Real Options: lessons from Netscape]&lt;/ref&gt;  As regards the option analysis, since the patent provides the firm with the right to develop the product, it will do so only if the [[present value]] of the expected cash flows from the product exceeds the cost of development, and the patent rights thus correspond to a [[call option]]. See [[Patent valuation#Option-based method|Patent valuation § Option-based method]]. Similar analysis may be applied to [[Option (filmmaking)|options on films]] (or other works of [[intellectual property]]) and the valuation of [[film studio]]s.

== Cultural valuation method ==
Besides mathematical approaches for the valuation of companies a rather unknown method includes also the cultural aspect. The so-called Cultural valuation method (Cultural Due Diligence) seeks to combine existing knowledge, motivation and internal culture with the results of a net-asset-value method. Especially during a company takeover uncovering hidden problems is of high importance for a later success of the business venture.

== Discounts and premiums ==
The valuation approaches yield the [[fair market value]] of the Company as a whole. In valuing a minority, non-controlling interest in a business, however, the valuation professional must consider the applicability of discounts that affect such interests.
Discussions of discounts and premiums frequently begin with a review of the "levels of value". There are three common levels of value: controlling interest, marketable minority, and non-marketable minority.
The intermediate level, marketable minority interest, is less than the controlling interest level and higher than the non-marketable minority interest level. The marketable minority interest level represents the perceived value of equity interests that are freely traded without any restrictions. These interests are generally traded on the New York Stock Exchange, AMEX, NASDAQ, and other exchanges where there is a ready market for equity securities. These values represent a minority interest in the subject companies – small blocks of stock that represent less than 50% of the company's equity, and usually much less than 50%.
Controlling interest level is the value that an investor would be willing to pay to acquire more than 50% of a company's stock, thereby gaining the attendant prerogatives of control. Some of the prerogatives of control include: electing directors, hiring and firing the company's management and determining their compensation; declaring dividends and distributions, determining the company's strategy and line of business, and acquiring, selling or liquidating the business. This level of value generally contains a [[control premium]] over the intermediate level of value, which typically ranges from 25% to 50%. An additional premium may be paid by strategic investors who are motivated by synergistic motives.
Non-marketable, minority level is the lowest level on the chart, representing the level at which non-controlling equity interests in private companies are generally valued or traded. This level of value is discounted because no ready market exists in which to purchase or sell interests. Private companies are less "liquid" than publicly traded companies, and transactions in private companies take longer and are more uncertain. Between the intermediate and lowest levels of the chart, there are restricted shares of publicly traded companies.
Despite a growing inclination of the IRS and Tax Courts to challenge valuation discounts, Shannon Pratt suggested in a scholarly presentation recently that valuation discounts are actually increasing as the differences between public and private companies is widening .  Publicly traded stocks have grown more liquid in the past decade due to rapid electronic trading, reduced commissions, and governmental deregulation. These developments have not improved the liquidity of interests in private companies, however.
Valuation discounts are multiplicative, so they must be considered in order. Control premiums and their inverse, minority interest discounts, are considered before marketability discounts are applied.

=== Discount for lack of control ===
The first discount that must be considered is the discount for lack of control, which in this instance is also a minority interest discount. Minority interest discounts are the inverse of control premiums, to which the following mathematical relationship exists:
MID = 1 – [1 / (1 + CP)]
The most common source of data regarding control premiums is the Control Premium Study, published annually by Mergerstat since 1972. Mergerstat compiles data regarding publicly announced mergers, acquisitions and divestitures involving 10% or more of the equity interests in public companies, where the purchase price is $1 million or more and at least one of the parties to the transaction is a [[United States entity|U.S. entity]]. Mergerstat defines the "control premium" as the percentage difference between the acquisition price and the share price of the freely traded public shares five days prior to the announcement of the M&amp;A transaction.
While it is not without valid criticism, Mergerstat control premium data (and the minority interest discount derived therefrom) is widely accepted within the valuation profession.

=== Discount for lack of marketability ===
A "discount for lack of marketability" (DLOM) may be applied to a minority block of stock to alter the valuation of that block.&lt;ref name=IRSpub&gt;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/dlom.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WillDLOM&gt;http://www.willamette.com/pubs/presentations/tax_lawyer_article.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another factor to be considered in valuing closely held companies is the marketability of an interest in such businesses. Marketability is defined as the ability to convert the business interest into cash quickly, with minimum transaction and administrative costs, and with a high degree of certainty as to the amount of net proceeds. There is usually a cost and a time lag associated with locating interested and capable buyers of interests in privately held companies, because there is no established market of readily available buyers and sellers.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

All other factors being equal, an interest in a publicly traded company is worth more because it is readily marketable. Conversely, an interest in a private-held company is worth less because no established market exists.&lt;ref&gt;Abudy M., Benninga S., and Shust E., (2016). The Cost of Equity for Private Firms, Journal of Corporate Finance 37, 431-443. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.01.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The IRS Valuation Guide for Income, Estate and Gift Taxes, Valuation Training for Appeals Officers" acknowledges the relationship between value and marketability, stating: "Investors prefer an asset which is easy to sell, that is, liquid."{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The discount for lack of control is separate and distinguishable from the discount for lack of marketability. It is the valuation professional's task to quantify the lack of marketability of an interest in a privately held company. Because, in this case, the subject interest is not a controlling interest in the Company, and the owner of that interest cannot compel liquidation to convert the subject interest to cash quickly, and no established market exists on which that interest could be sold, the discount for lack of marketability is appropriate.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Several empirical studies have been published that attempt to quantify the discount for lack of marketability. These studies include the restricted stock studies and the pre-IPO studies. &lt;ref&gt;Abudy M. and Benninga S., (2016). Valuing Restricted Stock Grants to Non-Executive Employees, Journal of Economics and Business 86, 33-51. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aggregate of these studies indicate average discounts of 35% and 50%, respectively.  Some experts believe the Lack of Control and Marketability discounts can aggregate discounts for as  much as ninety percent of a Company's fair market value, specifically with family-owned companies.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==== Restricted stock studies ====
Restricted stocks are equity securities of public companies that are similar in all respects to the freely traded stocks of those companies except that they carry a restriction that prevents them from being traded on the open market for a certain period of time, which is usually one year (two years prior to 1990). This restriction from active trading, which amounts to a lack of marketability, is the only distinction between the restricted stock and its freely traded counterpart. Restricted stock can be traded in private transactions and usually do so at a discount. The restricted stock studies attempt to verify the difference in price at which the restricted shares trade versus the price at which the same unrestricted securities trade in the open market as of the same date.
The underlying data by which these studies arrived at their conclusions has not been made public. Consequently, it is not possible when valuing a particular company to compare the characteristics of that company to the study data. Still, the existence of a marketability discount has been recognized by valuation professionals and the Courts, and the restricted stock studies are frequently cited as empirical evidence. Notably, the lowest average discount reported by these studies was 26% and the highest average discount was 40%.

==== Option pricing ====
In addition to the restricted stock studies, U.S. publicly traded companies are able to sell stock to offshore investors (SEC [[Regulation S]], enacted in 1990) without registering the shares with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. The offshore buyers may resell these shares in the United States, still without having to register the shares, after holding them for just 40 days. Typically, these shares are sold for 20% to 30% below the publicly traded share price. Some of these transactions have been reported with discounts of more than 30%, resulting from the lack of marketability. These discounts are similar to the [[marketability discounts]] inferred from the restricted and pre-IPO studies, despite the holding period being just 40 days.
Studies based on the prices paid for options have also confirmed similar discounts. If one holds [[restricted stock]] and purchases an option to sell that stock at the market price (a [[put option|put]]), the holder has, in effect, purchased marketability for the shares. The price of the [[put option|put]] is equal to the marketability discount. The range of marketability discounts derived by this study was 32% to 49%.  However, ascribing the entire value of a put option to marketability is misleading, because the primary source of put value comes from the downside price protection.  A correct economic analysis would use deeply in-the-money puts or [[Single-stock futures]], demonstrating that marketability of restricted stock is of low value because it is easy to hedge using unrestricted stock or futures trades.

==== Pre-IPO studies ====
Another approach to measure the marketability discount is to compare the prices of stock offered in [[initial public offerings]] (IPOs) to transactions in the same company's stocks prior to the IPO. Companies that are going public are required to disclose all transactions in their stocks for a period of three years prior to the IPO. The pre-IPO studies are the leading alternative to the restricted stock stocks in quantifying the marketability discount.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The pre-IPO studies are sometimes criticized because the sample size is relatively small, the pre-IPO transactions may not be arm's length, and the financial structure and product lines of the studied companies may have changed during the three year pre-IPO window.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

=== Applying the studies ===
The studies confirm what the marketplace knows intuitively: Investors covet liquidity and loathe obstacles that impair liquidity. Prudent investors buy illiquid investments only when there is a sufficient discount in the price to increase the [[rate of return]] to a level which brings risk-reward back into balance.
The referenced studies establish a reasonable range of valuation discounts from the mid-30%s to the low 50%s. The more recent studies appeared to yield a more conservative range of discounts than older studies, which may have suffered from smaller sample sizes. Another method of quantifying the lack of marketability discount is the Quantifying Marketability Discounts Model (QMDM).

== Estimates of business value ==
The evidence on the market value of specific businesses varies widely, largely depending on reported market transactions in the equity of the firm. A fraction of businesses are "publicly traded," meaning that their equity can be purchased and sold by investors in stock markets available to the general public. Publicly traded companies on major stock markets have an easily calculated "market capitalization" that is a direct estimate of the market value of the firm's equity. Some publicly traded firms have relatively few recorded trades (including many firms traded "over the counter" or in "pink sheets"). A far larger number of firms are privately held. Normally, equity interests in these firms (which include corporations, partnerships, limited-liability companies, and some other organizational forms) are traded privately, and often irregularly. As a result, previous transactions provide limited evidence as to the current value of a private company primarily because business value changes over time, and the share price is associated with considerable uncertainty due to limited market exposure and high transaction costs.

A number of stock market indicators in the United States and other countries provide an indication of the market value of publicly traded firms. The Survey of Consumer Finance in the US also includes an estimate of household ownership of stocks, including indirect ownership through mutual funds.&lt;ref&gt;Bucks, Kennickell, Mach, &amp; Moore, "Changes in US Family Finances from 2004 to 2007: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances," Federal Reserve Bulletin, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 and 2007 SCF indicate a growing trend in stock ownership, with 51% of households indicating a direct or indirect ownership of stocks, with the majority of those respondents indicating indirect ownership through mutual funds. Few indications are available on the value of privately held firms. Anderson (2009) recently estimated the market value of U.S. privately held and publicly traded firms, using Internal Revenue Service and SCF data.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Patrick L., "Value of Private Businesses in the United States," Business Economics (2009) 44, 87–108. {{doi|10.1057/be.2009.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He estimates that privately held firms produced more income for investors, and had more value than publicly held firms, in 2004.

'''''Car Dogs''''' is a film which stars [[George Lopez]], [[Dash Mihok]], [[Patrick J. Adams]], [[Octavia Spencer]], and [[Josh Hopkins]]. The film is set in a car dealership where, in a single day, salesmen have to sell more cars than they ever have done.
==Story==
The story is set at the Chamberlain Auto Group which is run by Malcolm Chamberlain (played by [[Chris Mulkey]]). He has his son Mark working for him as the GM. Malcolm is a ruthless and manipulative car dealer. He offers his son a major part of a new store if he and the team of car salesmen can move 35 cars in a day, and they have to do it by 5pm.&lt;ref&gt;''Geek News Network'', March 24, 2017 - [https://geeknewsnetwork.net/2017/03/24/car-dogs-movie-review/ Car Dogs | Movie Review by Eric Fiallos]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Automotive News]]'', April 29, 2017 - [http://www.autonews.com/article/20170429/RETAIL07/305019950/car-dogs-have-their-day-on-screen DOG EAT DOG, 'Car Dogs' have their day on screen - Stephanie Hernandez McGavin]&lt;/ref&gt; The sales manager (played by [[Josh Hopkins]]) has his eyes on the new dealership for himself and is playing dirty tricks behind Mark's back.&lt;ref&gt;''Geek News Network'', March 24, 2017 - [https://geeknewsnetwork.net/2017/03/24/car-dogs-movie-review/ Car Dogs | Movie Review by Eric Fiallos]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The film came about as a result of Mark Edward King who was a student of Adam Collis. He wrote a short film script about car salesmen at a dealership who were trying to sell as many cars in a single day, more than they had ever done. King was encouraged by Collis to expand it into a script for a full feature.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Phoenix New Times]]'', March 16, 2017 - [http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/arts/car-dogs-movie-george-lopez-asu-9159414 The Story Behind Car Dogs, Starring George Lopez and Made (in Part) by Arizona State University Interns - M.V.

A '''cool store''' or '''cold store''' is a large [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] room or building designed for storage of goods in an environment below the outdoor temperature. Products needing refrigeration include [[fruit]], [[vegetable]]s, [[seafood]] and [[meat]]. Cold stores are often located near [[shipping port]]s used for import/export of produce.

Cool stores have been an essential part of the shipping industry since the late 19th century. [[Christian Salvesen]] expanded from a small Scottish whaling company when they established a cold store in [[Grimsby]], then a major fishing port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/15963682.Obituary___Sir_Gerald_Elliot__former_chairman_of_Christian_Salvesen_and_patron_of_the_arts_in_Scotland/|title=Obituary - Sir Gerald Elliot, former chairman of Christian Salvesen and patron of the arts in Scotland|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=8 February 2018|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine Elms Cold Store, constructed in 1965, could hold 16,000 tons of meat, cheese and butter. It closed in 1979 and was used by squatters and various illegal activities before being demolished towards the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/blog/16-creepy-london-stories-to-get-you-in-the-mood-for-halloween-103116|title=16 creepy London stories to get you in the mood for Halloween|first=Andy|last=Hill|work=Time Out|date=31 October 2016|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stores themselves vary in size. A thirty hectare (74 acre) cold store with 200,000 tonne capacity was planned for [[Wuhan, China]].

'''Cryogenic deflashing''' is a [[deflashing]] process that uses [[cryogenic]] temperatures to aid in the removal of [[flash (manufacturing)|flash]] on [[casting|cast]] or [[molding (process)|molded]] workpieces. These temperatures cause the flash to become stiff or brittle and to break away cleanly. Cryogenic deflashing is the preferred process when removing excess material from oddly shaped, custom molded products.
==Process==
Parts are loaded into a parts basket.  A cryogen, such as [[liquid nitrogen]], is used to cool the workpieces; once cooled they are [[Tumble finishing|tumbled]] and [[media blasting|blasted]] with media pellets, ranging size from {{convert|0.006|to|0.080|in}}. In some instances, cryogenic deflashing does not utilize a blasting action, relying instead only on the tumbling of the parts to remove flash on the outer edges.

==Advantages==
Cryogenic deflashing provides various advantages over manual deflashing and other traditional deflashing methods.
* The process maintains part integrity and critical tolerances.
* Since it is a batch process, the price per piece is far less as many more parts can be processed in a given amount of time.
* Cryogenic deflashing extends mold life. Rather than replace or repair a mold (which typically involves downtime and high cost), the parts can be deflashed. This is typical of parts molded at the end of their [[product lifetime]].
* The process is computer controlled, therefore removing the human operator variable from the process. 
* The process offers consistent results from lot to lot. 
* Cryogenic deflashing is non-abrasive. 
* The cost per part is generally well below any alternative technique.

==Applications==
A wide range of molded materials can utilize cryogenic deflashing with proven results. These include:
* [[Silicone]]s
* [[Plastic]]s – (both thermoset &amp; thermoplastic)
* [[Rubber]]s – (including neoprene &amp; urethane)
* [[Liquid crystal polymer]] (LCP)
* Glass-filled nylons
* Aluminum zinc die cast

Examples of applications that use cryogenic deflashing include:
* [[O-ring]]s &amp; [[gasket]]s
* Catheters and other in-vitro medical
* Insulators and other electric / electronic
* Valve stems, washers and fittings
* Tubes and flexible boots
* Face masks &amp; goggles

Today, many molding operations are using cryogenic deflashing instead of rebuilding or repairing molds on products that are approaching their [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]]. It is often more prudent and economical to add a few cents of production cost for a part than invest in a new molding tool that can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and has a limited service life due to declining production forecasts.

In other cases, cryogenic deflashing has proven to be an enabling technology, permitting the economical manufacture of high quality, high precision parts fabricated with cutting edge materials and compounds.

A '''fluidized bed concentrator''' ('''FBC''') is an industrial process for the treatment of exhaust air. The system uses a bed of [[activated carbon]] beads to adsorb [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs) from the [[exhaust gas]]. Evolving from the previous fixed-bed and carbon rotor concentrators, the FBC system forces the VOC-laden air through several perforated steel trays, increasing the velocity of the air and allowing the sub-millimeter carbon beads to fluidize, or behave as if suspended in a liquid. This increases the surface area of the carbon-gas interaction, making it more effective at capturing VOCs.

==Components==
[[File:FBC-Solidworks.png|thumb|A 3-D design of the fluidized bed concentrator in Solidworks.]]
The '''fluidized bed concentrator''' consists of five primary components: 
*[[Adsorption]] tower
*[[Desorption]] tower
*[[Thermal oxidizer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tksindustrial.com/thermal-oxidizer|title=Thermal Oxidizer and Use with Fluidized Bed Concentrators|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Carbon transport system
*Process fans: Inlet [[adsorption|Adsorber]], Inlet Desorber, Outlet Oxidizer to Stack

==How it works==
[[File:FBC Flow Schematic.png|thumb|left|400px|A flow schematic of process gas in the Fluidized Bed Concentrator system.]]
Industrial Processes requiring ventilation, including paint booths,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toyota named Low-Carbon Auto Manufacturing of the Year|url=http://diversityandcommerce.biz/cocacola-enterprises-ford-toyota-named-as-low-carbon-champions-p3783-179.htm|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; printing, and chemical production, exhaust the ventilated air to the '''fluidized bed concentrator''' (FBC) at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VOC Emissions from Industrial Painting Processes|url=http://www.metalfinishing.com/view/2721/voc-emissions-from-industrial-painting-processes-as-a-source-of-fuel-cell-energy/|publisher=Metal Finishing|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The air first passes into the Adsorption tower, where it moves through six perforated trays of clean carbon beads. The 0.7mm [[Bead activated carbon (BAC)]] fluidizes in the trays and captures the VOCs as they intermix.

The saturated carbon beads are passed from the Adsorber tower to the Desorber tower, where the beads are heated to 350&amp;nbsp;°F and the VOCs are released. Typically the Adsorber tower is many times larger than the Desorber tower, leading to an air volume reduction and an increase in VOC concentration. The ratio of Adsorber size to Desorber size is called the Concentration Ratio, and ranges from 10:1 to 100:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Environmental VOC Emissions|url=http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2013-14/environment-operations-facility|publisher=Ford|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentrated VOC gas stream is sent from the Desorb tower to a [http://tksindustrial.com/thermal-oxidizer thermal oxidizer], where the organic compounds are heated to 1400&amp;nbsp;°F and oxidized, or broken down into Carbon Dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), Water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0), and by-products. In some cases, small amounts of Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;), and other gases are produced.

==Emissions and energy usage==
[[File:Honda Alabama Wins Air Quality Award.jpg|thumb|Members of the Honda Alabama Environmental Air Quality team are honored for their efforts to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hondaalabama.com/article/hma-honored-as-air-conservationist-of-the-year|title=HMA Honored As Air Conservationist of the Year|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The primary advantage of the FBC over traditional rotor concentrators lies in its ability to achieve any concentration ratio up to the [[lower explosive limit]] (LEL). This allows Honda Alabama's paint shop to switch from oxidizing 100,000 CFM of VOCs in a Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tksindustrial.com/regenerative-thermal-oxidizer|title=Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer Product Details|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to oxidizing only 1,500 CFM of VOCs in a small thermal oxidizer, at a much higher concentration. Reducing the volume of air to be oxidized from 100,000 CFM to 1,500 CFM (66:1 concentration ratio), allows for a much lower energy usage and consequently, fewer CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.

{{quotation | "Despite an increase in Line 2 production, Honda is realizing a reduction in plant VOC emissions of nearly 60 metric tons annually as a result of the installation of the FBC system. Also, the new [FBC] system uses approximately 20% of the energy of an RTO system." - Honda Manufacturing of Alabama}}

'''G. Peignot et Fils foundry''' (Fonderie G. Peignot et Fils) was a French [[type foundry|typographic foundry]], established in 1898 and closed down between 1919 and 1923 after a merger to become [[Deberny &amp; Peignot|Deberny &amp; Peignot foundry]]. Led by [[Georges Peignot]] (1872&amp;ndash;1915), G. Peignot &amp; Fils was a prestigious French typographic foundry, an "elite house",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Louis Barthou | title = Lettres à un jeune français. XXV. La contagion sublime | journal = Les Annales  | volume = | issue = 1727 | pages =  | date = July 1916  | language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Louis Barthou]], former French Prime Minister.

== History ==
G. Peignot et Fils is founded in 1898 in [[Paris]], after absorption of the '''Veuve Routier et Peignot''' foundry (established in 1867), itself heir of the foundry "Veuve Routier" (established in 1865) and foundry of Pierre Leclerc (established in 1842).

=== Foundry of Pierre Leclerc (1842) ===
In 1842, Pierre Leclerc, a craftsman, creates a [[Letter-spacing|fixed spaces]] foundry (hand-set metal type to achieve letter-spacing) in Paris. ''"He can be considered as the genuine creator of the fixed spaces industry"'', says the magazine ''La fonderie typographique'' in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = | title = Gustave Peignot | journal = La fonderie typographique | volume = | issue = 7 | pages =  | date = 1899  | language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fixed spaces between words and lines, margins, etc., require great precision. He invents a new process, instead of cutting fixed spaces, pouring them into molds, which increases accuracy. In 1856, after his death,&lt;ref name="Tuleu"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Tuleu | first1 = Jane | title = Souvenirs de famille | place = Paris | publisher = Deberny |pages = 77 | date = 1915 | isbn =  | language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company management is entrusted to a friend of his widow, Clémentine Dupont de Vieux Pont (wife Peignot, 1815-1897). She then settles beside her his son, Gustave Peignot (1839-1899), engineer of [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech|Arts et Métiers school]].&lt;ref name="froissart"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Froissart | first1 = Jean-Luc | title = L’or, l’âme et les cendres du plomb. L'épopée des Peignot, 1815-1983 | place = Paris | publisher = librairie Tekhnê |pages = | date = 2004 | isbn = 2-9522836-0-5 | language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Veuve Routier (1865) and Veuve Routier et G. Peignot (1867) foundries===
In 1865, the foundry of Pierre Leclerc is sold by auction to Peignot. The new company is called "Veuve Routier" (''Widow Routier''), which is the name of the lessor having made possible the purchase by Gustave Peignot. In 1867, Gustave Peignot and the lessor merge in a company which takes the name of "Veuve Routier et Peignot."

In 1869 the company moved to Boulevard de Montrouge (now boulevard Edgar-Quinet), at no. 66-68, where a building is constructed (upstairs for the family, ground for the plant).&lt;ref name="Tuleu" /&gt; In 1875, the debt to the Veuve Routier is cleared, and Gustave Peignot becomes sole owner of the company and the building.
[[File:1883-g-peignot-fonderie-publicite.png|thumb|600 px|Advertisement for G. Peignot foundry published in ''L'imprimerie'' magazine, in 1883]]

From 1875 to 1898, Gustave Peignot continues to make great profits with fixed spaces production, not amputated this time by refunds to the Veuve Routier. ''"In this lead will Thou find gold"'', used to say his mother.&lt;ref name="froissart" /&gt; At this time, Gustave Peignot becomes first President of the Chambre syndicale des maîtres fondeurs typographes (trade association of type foundry masters). He marries Marie Laporte, and is a father of 8 children.

=== G. Peignot et Fils Foundry (1898)=== 
In 1898, Gustave Peignot distributes to his children an equal parts of stocks and appoints Georges Peignot, his second son, as co-manager.&lt;ref name="Tuleu" /&gt; The company's name changes for "G. Peignot &amp; Fils" (''G. Peignot &amp; Sons''). He dies in 1899.

Georges Peignot continues the production of fixed spaces, causing significant growth in sales, and launches studies for new [[typeface]]s. The quality of fonts puts foundry G. Peignot et Fils at the forefront. In 12 years, Georges Peignot creates many typefaces: [[Grasset (typeface)|Grasset]], [[Auriol (typeface)|Auriol]], [[Cochin (typeface)|Cochin]], [[Garamond (typeface)|Garamond-Peignot]], [[Bellery-Desfontaines (typeface)|Bellery-Desfontaines]], [[Naudin (typeface)|Naudin]], [[Guy-Arnoux (typeface)|Guy-Arnoux]]. He also publishes a ''Specimen'', great typefaces catalog (still highly sought, 600 pages, 2 volumes).

In 1904, to address growth of sales, G. Peignot et Fils built a new plant at the corner of [[Rue Cabanis (Paris)|Cabanis]] and [[Rue Ferrus (Paris)|Ferrus]] streets. In 1911-1912, Georges Peignot sends in South America his two young brothers, Lucien and Rémy, looking for distributors. The company is at its peak.

But war brakes out in 1914. Volunteer for the front, Adjudant Georges Peignot is killed by a bullet to the forehead at the head of his section, Sept. 28, 1915, near Givenchy.&lt;ref name="froissart"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Froissart | first1 = Jean-Luc | title = L’or, l’âme et les cendres du plomb. L'épopée des Peignot, 1815-1983 | place = Paris | publisher = librairie Tekhnê |pages = | date = 2004 | isbn = 2-9522836-0-5 | language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt; His four brothers also die.

The legacy of Georges Peignot is taken hostage by infighting: in 1919, his own mother, Marie Laporte-Peignot, requires its children or their widows the payment of a substantial sum (1 million of French francs, equivalent of USD [2015] 1,4 million) in the form of a capital increase&lt;ref name="froissart" /&gt; to its competitor Deberny (founded by [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]] in 1826), owned by Charles Tuleu (heir of Alexandre de Berny and husband of Jane Peignot-Tuleu). In 1923, G. Peignot et Fils foundry disappears, victim of the merger between Deberny foundry (2.6 million, including the 1 million Peignot subsidy) and G. Peignot &amp; Fils foundry (4.1 million). The new company's name relegates Peignot's name in background: the new entity is indeed called "[[Deberny et Peignot]]" and commonly called "Deberny". Against all logic (the manager is usually chosen by the majority shareholder), the manager of the small Deberny foundry, Robert Girard, under whom the old foundry Deberny had collapsed,&lt;ref name="froissart" /&gt; takes the reins of the new entity.

In 1922, the Commission de l’enseignement et des beaux-arts (governmental ''Commission for education and fine arts'') suggests honoring the story of Peignot: it transports the awls of the foundry in the building of the Imprimerie nationale (Government printing office), near [[Rue Gutenberg (Paris)|Gutenberg street]] in [[Paris]]. And it proposes that the continuation of this street would be baptized "[[Rue des Quatre-Frères-Peignot (Paris)|rue des Quatre-Frères-Peignot]]" (''Four-brothers-Peignot street'') in memory of Georges, André, Lucien and Rémy who died between September, 1914 and June, 1916, snatched by the World War I.

==Biography==

Takeuchi was born in 1946&lt;ref name="ngmf"/&gt; and gained a B.A. from [[International Christian University]] in [[Tokyo]], and an M.B.A. and Ph.D. from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="ngmf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hbs"/&gt; His early non-academic career included work at [[McCann-Erickson]] in Tokyo and San Francisco and at [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="hbs"/&gt;

From 1976 to 1983 Takeuchi had his first faculty position at Harvard Business School, as an assistant professor in the Marketing Unit.&lt;ref name="hbs"/&gt; He moved to [[Hitotsubashi University]] in Tokyo in 1983, becoming a professor in 1987.&lt;ref name="ngmf"/&gt; In another spell at Harvard Business School from 1995 to 1996, Takeuchi served as a visiting professor in the Advanced Management Program.&lt;ref name="hbs"/&gt;

In 1998 Takeuchi became the founding dean of Hitotsubashi University's business school, the Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy.
&lt;ref name="ngmf"/&gt; 2010 saw Takeuchi appointed to the position of Professor Emeritus at that university and in the same year he was additionally appointed as a professor at Harvard Business School.&lt;ref name="mitsui"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mitsui.com/jp/en/company/outline/officer/1219499_7041.html|title=Director - Hirotaka Takeuchi  |publisher=Mitsui|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Takeuchi has written or co-authored numerous articles for the [[Harvard Business Review]].&lt;ref name="hbr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/search?term=hirotaka+takeuchi|title=Search : Hirotaka Takeuchi  |publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has served on the planning board of the [[World Economic Forum]]&lt;ref name="ngmf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=2529243&amp;capId=52322137&amp;previousCapId=91829&amp;previousTitle=Mitsui%20%26%20Co.%2C%20Ltd.|title=Executive Profile - Hirotaka Takeuchi Ph.D.  |publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an external director at [[Mitsui|Mitsui &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref name="mitsui"/&gt; and an outside director at Daiwa Securities Group Inc.&lt;ref name="daiwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daiwa-grp.jp/english/corporate/corporate_01.html|title=Daiwa Securities Group Inc. - Corporate Profile  |publisher=Daiwa Securities|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The New New Product Development Game ==

Takeuchi collaborated on a number of articles with [[Ikujiro Nonaka]] (野中 郁次郎), a colleague at Hitotsubashi University, including 
the 1986 Harvard Business Review article ''The New New Product Development Game'', in which they emphasised speed and flexibility for [[new product development]].&lt;ref name="nnpdg"&gt;{{cite journal
| last       = Takeuchi 
| first      = H
| last2      = Nonaka
| first2     = I
| date       = 1986

| issue      = January/February 
| pages      = 285-305
| doi        = 
| access-date = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article looked at practices in a number of successful manufacturing companies such as [[Fuji-Xerox]], [[Honda]], [[3M]] and [[Toyota]]. The authors drew attention to the practise in those companies of having an overlapping development process ('like [[Sashimi]]'), rather than the older sequential approach.&lt;ref name="nnpdg"/&gt;  They likened it to the game of [[Rugby Union]], where a team 'tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth'  and where a team may employ different tactics to make the best use of its talents.&lt;ref name="nnpdg"/&gt; 

The authors found that teams in the most successful companies they examined exhibited the following conditions:&lt;ref name="nnpdg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="js1"&gt;{{cite book | first = Jeff| last = Sutherland| authorlink = | author2 = | year =  | month = | title =  Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time| chapter = | editor = | others = | edition =  | pages = 44|  publisher = Random House Business Books| location = | isbn = 9781847941107| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Autonomy - being self-organising and empowered to make decisions over how to do the work&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cross-fertilization - having within the teams all the skills needed to complete the task&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Self-Transcendence -  elevating their goals and pushing beyond the normally accepted limit; challenging the status quo&lt;/li&gt;


The article attracted attention when it was published&lt;ref name="js2"/&gt; but its significance for software development was born seven years later when a team at Easel Corporation led by [[Jeff Sutherland]] alighted on the article and spotted the opportunity it offered to achieve their goal of delivering software on schedule and under budget.&lt;ref name="js2"/&gt;

Sutherland went on to develop the concept in conjunction with [[Ken Schwaber]] as the [[Scrum (development)|Scrum framework]]&lt;ref name="si"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scruminc.com/takeuchi-and-nonaka-roots-of-scrum/|title=Takeuchi and Nonaka: The Roots of Scrum |publisher=scrum.inc|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an [[agile software development]] technique now used across the globe.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2011/04/29/scrum-is-a-major-management-discovery/#2551b1d07782|title=Scrum is a Major Management Discovery|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Nonaka-Takeuchi model of accumulation of knowledge ==

Takeuchi's colleague Ikujiro Nonaka wrote an article ''The Knowledge-Creating Company'' in the Harvard Business Review, 1991.
&lt;ref name="in"&gt;{{cite journal
| last       = Nonaka
| first      = I
| date       = 1991
| title      = The Knowledge-Creating Company
| url        = https://hbr.org/2007/07/the-knowledge-creating-company

| volume     = 
| issue      = November/December
| pages      = 
| doi        = 
| access-date = 8 November 2017
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It explored two types of knowledge, namely [[tacit knowledge]] which is that learned by experience and communicated indirectly, and [[explicit knowledge]], which is that recorded in documentation, manuals and procedures. Nonaka wrote that Japanese companies viewed knowledge as primarily tacit but had mastered converting tacit to explicit and back again (the 'spiral of knowledge').&lt;ref name="in"/&gt; In 1995 Nonaka and Takeuchi co-authored a book which expanded on the subject and brought it to a wider audience&lt;ref name="flbf"&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ikujiro+Nonaka+%3a+Knowledge+creation.-a085608620
|page=
|title=  The Free Library - Ikujiro Nonaka : Knowledge creation.
|publisher= Farlex inc.
|accessdate=8 November 2017
}}&lt;/ref&gt;: ''The Knowledge-Creating Company : How Japanese Companies Create the Dynamics of Innovation''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Nonaka |first=Ikujiro |author-link=Ikujiro Nonaka |last2=Takeuchi |first2=Hirotaka |author2-link= |year=1995 |title=The Knowledge-Creating Company: how Japanese companies create the dynamics of innovation |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |pages= 284 |isbn=9780195092691|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-qxrPaU1-MC }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The authors described the methods used in successful Japanese companies to create new knowledge and use it to produce successful products. They called this 'organizational knowledge creation' - an ability to 'create new knowledge, disseminate it throughout the organization and embody it in products, services and systems'.

The book was named as Best Book of the Year in Business and Management, 1996 by the [[Association of American Publishers]].&lt;ref name="flbf"/&gt;

He had previously been a proportional representation federal deputy from the state to the [[LXII Legislature of the Mexican Congress|LXII Legislature]].&lt;ref name="sil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Perfil del legislador|url=http://sil.gobernacion.gob.mx/Librerias/pp_PerfilLegislador.php?SID=&amp;Referencia=9217023|publisher=Legislative Information System|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Life==

Bonilla was born in Tijuana and obtained his degree in business administration from the [[UNAM]] in 1983. He worked in a variety of companies, including Electrol de México, CONESA, and COVIMEX de México.{{r|sil}} Between 1982 and 1985, he directed the [[Potros de Tijuana]] baseball club, which played in the [[Liga Mexicana del Pacífico]].&lt;ref name="ef"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/jaime-bonilla-sedujo-a-amlo-pero-dividio-a-morena-en-bc|date=29 December 2016|title=Jaime Bonilla sedujo a AMLO, pero dividió a Morena en BC|first=Rivelino|last=Rueda|work=El Financiero|language=Spanish|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, he became the director general and a columnist of the ''Diario de Baja California'' newspaper, which began a career in media ownership for Bonilla. Through his company PSN (originally an acronym for Pacific Spanish Network, now Primer Sistema de Noticias), he directly operates [[XESS-AM]] 620 and [[XESDD-AM]] 1030 in Tijuana. He also owned [[XHENB-TV]] channel 29 in [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]], now a cable-only outlet, and his company Media Sports de México holds the concessions for two radio stations operated under brokerage agreements by American programmers, [[XEPE-AM]] 1700 and [[XHPRS-FM]] 105.7. Bonilla also acquired cable systems in Ensenada and [[Tecate]]. Bonilla also owned radio station [[KURS]] 1040 in San Diego through his company Quetzal Bilingual Communications; the station was sold in 2016 for $900,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insideradio.com/features/deal_digest/deal-digest---november/article_ba52b346-b146-11e6-b43e-cf236de8b4fe.html|work=Inside Radio|title=Deal Digest - November 23, 2016|date=23 November 2016|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Bonilla, then a dual citizen of Mexico and the United States, joined the board of the Otay Water District in Otay Mesa, California. While in the US, he was a donor to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] causes and even was on the California finance committee for [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.razon.com.mx/republicano-que-financio-a-mccain-ya-es-diputado-del-pt/|work=La Razón|first=Jorge|last=González|title=Republicano que financió a McCain ya es diputado del PT|date=19 September 2012|accessdate=10 August 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, he announced his resignation from the water board in order to run for federal deputy and simultaneously join the 2012 presidential campaign of [[Andrés Manuel López Obrador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/sdut-otays-bonilla-resigns-high-profile-posts-mexico-2012mar27-story.html|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|title=Otay's Bonilla resigns for high-profile posts in Mexico|first=Sandra|last=Dibble|accessdate=10 August 2018|date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he renounced his dual citizenship,{{r|ef}} a move necessary to meet the constitutional requirements to run for office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/opinion/Doble-nacionalidad-20180603-0069.html|title=Doble nacionalidad|first=Marco Antonio|last=Baños|work=El Economista|date=3 June 2018|language=Spanish|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a proportional representation deputy on the [[Labor Party (Mexico)|PT]] list, during which time he served as the president of the Northern Border Matters Commission and was the state campaign coordinator for the PT in the 2013 Baja California state elections.{{r|sil}} Bonilla left the post in 2014 in order to become the state party director for the then-new Morena party.{{r|ef}} His relationship with López Obrador remained close; in 2016, Bonilla invited him to his [[Petco Park]] suite for the [[2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].{{r|ef}} Party members and leaders say that in Bonilla's media holdings, López Obrador saw a "gold mine" to gain media exposure in Baja California.{{r|ef}}

On 31 January 2018, López Obrador announced that Bonilla would be the primary Senate candidate in Baja California for the [[Juntos Haremos Historia]] coalition, forming a ticket with [[Alejandra León Gastélum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blancoynegro.mx/~wynegr0/politica-y-policiaca/16985-va-jaime-bonilla-por-la-candidatura-al-senado.html|work=Blanco y Negro|date=31 January 2018|first=Conrado|last=Osuna Murillo|title=Va Jaime Bonilla por la candidatura al Senado|language=Spanish|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Juntos Haremos Historia ticket took first place in the election, securing both candidates seats in the Senate. However, Bonilla has stated that he will only remain in office three months and will then become the state development coordinator in Baja California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lacronica.com/EdicionEnLinea/Notas/Noticias/13072018/1356617-Jaime-Bonilla-solo-sera-Senador-por-BC-durante-tres-meses.html|work=La Crónica|first=Glenn|last=Sánchez|date=13 July 2018|title=Jaime Bonilla solo será Senador por BC durante tres meses|accessdate=10 August 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== HUMU Culture ==

Laszlo Bock along with two former Google executives Wayne Crosby and Jessie Wisdom founded HUMU, a startup devoted to making work more beneficial for people in different industries. Their main objective of the company is to employ Behavioral Change Technology in ensuring that employees are happier in their respective jobs. The technology has become popular because it establishes a viable technique to increase adoption of positive modifications in behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.productiveedge.com/blog/developing-effective-behavioral-change-technology/|title=Developing Effective Behavioral Change Technology - Productive Edge Blog|date=2015-04-09|work=Productive Edge Blog|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The company’s strategies are anchored on novel innovations in machine erudition and many years of conducting scientific research on human behavior. Business Insider was able to interview Bock and Crosby regarding the hiring process at HUMU. The co-founders pointed out one quality that makes a certain candidate more prominent and that is the capability to convey his or her own story. This trait is just as essential as technical proficiency. Applicants get the chance to present their personal history and experiences to the interviewer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ex-google-employees-humu-hiring-2018-5|title=Google's former HR exec has a new startup — and he says technical skills alone aren't enough to get hired|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An article published in Forbes.com quoted HUMU’s mission statement as “''Making work better everywhere through machine learning, science, and a little bit of love.''” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/vickyvalet/2018/05/01/after-a-year-of-secrecy-laszlo-bock-and-wayne-crosby-break-their-silence-on-humu/#143e929c1c94|title=After A Year Of Secrecy, Laszlo Bock And Wayne Crosby Break Their Silence On Humu|last=Valet|first=Vicky|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Mahmoud Khayami''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Order of St. Sylvester|KSS]], [[Royal Order of Francis I|GCFO]] ({{lang-fa|محمود خيامی}}) born  1930 in [[Mashhad]], [[Iran]], is an [[Iranian people|Iranian]] industrialist and philanthropist, of French nationality.

==Life==
Mahmoud Khayami was born in 1930 in Mashhad where he attended elementary and high school. In 1951 he transferred to Tehran and before long he was involved in the automotive industry. Eleven years later he inaugurated the Iran National company in partnership with his brother, Ahmad Khayami (who later formed a separate company : Kourosh Department Stores). Iran National was destined to become the largest industrial complex in Iran, today known as Iran Khodro or IKCO.

One of the leading champions of Iran's industrialization of the 1960s-70s, he began the production of the popular Peykan cars in 1967, based on cooperation with the Hillman-Hunter company of England which provided the model for it. By 1979, 100,000 cars were produced annually with approximately 44 percent of the parts manufactured in Iran. By 1979 Iran National and its affiliated enterprises employed over 20,000 workers in Tehran, Mashhad and Tabriz.

Although Khayami has retired, his family is still involved in the automotive industry, primarily in dealership ownership of one of their previous international partners [[Mercedes-Benz]], most notably in [[Berkshire]], England and [[Southern California]] where they operate Mercedes-Benz of Anaheim in the city of [[Anaheim]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].

In later life, Mahmoud Khayami has been active as a [[philanthropist]] and collector of fine [[Iranian art|Persian art]], forming the '''Khayami Collection'''. He has promoted of inter-religious relations in the UK and internationally with a special emphasis on relations between the Jewish, Christian and Muslim communities.  Among his activities have been the hosting at Chatham House ([[Chatham House|RIIA]]) of inter-religious conferences. He is involved with the ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'' project, and chairs the board of editors.

He now splits his time between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, having been forced to leave Iran at the time of the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Khayami is resident in the UK for over 20 years and has never returned to Iran.  His philanthropic work (now performed largely through the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070607212646/http://www.thekhayamifoundation.org/ Khayami Foundation]) was recognised in 2004 when he was invested as a Knight of the Pontifical Order of Pope Saint Sylvester by Pope [[John Paul II]], and in 2006 when he was invested as a Knight Commander of the [[Royal Order of Francis I]] by the [[Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro]]. He has also been decorated by the late [[King Hussein of Jordan]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.

It was announced by the Department of Education and Skills in 2005 that Mr Khayami had become a sponsor of the UK Government's [[Academy (England)|Academy]] programme and had sponsored two academies which will open in [[Sheffield]] during 2007. Both academies will be run by a leading Anglican Church School Trust.  It is well known that he is a friend of [[Tony Blair]] whom he has met on a number of occasions. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. He was appointed by The Queen as an Honorary [[CBE]] in 2011 for services to education.

He appeared in the 2008 [[Sunday Times Rich List]].

==Labour party donations==
On 3 June 2007, the Observer reported that he had donated £1 million to the Labour Party (one of the most generous ever donations to Labour, eclipsed only by a £2m donation from the steel billionaire [[Lakshmi Mittal]], and a similar sum given by [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Lord Sainsbury]]).

'''Massimo Cellino''' ({{IPA-it|ˈmasːimo tʃelː'iːno}}; born 28 July 1956) is an Italian entrepreneur and [[Association football|football]] club owner. Through his family trust Eleonora Sport Ltd he was the owner and chairman of the English club [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref name=YEPApr11&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/latest-whites-news/leeds-united-exclusive-massimo-cellino-interview-1-6554928|title=Leeds United exclusive: Massimo Cellino interview|author=Phil Hay|date=11 April 2014 |work=Yorkshire Evening Post|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently owns [[Brescia Calcio]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.football-italia.net/107947/official-cellino-buys-brescia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Cagliari Calcio===
Cellino was the chairman of the Italian association football club [[Cagliari Calcio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Fulvio |last=Bianchi |title=Sempre più Italia in Premier Cellino compra il West Ham |url=http://www.repubblica.it/sport/calcio/2010/01/13/news/cellino_al_west_ham-1935955/ |work=La Repubblica |date=13 January 2010 |accessdate=23 January 2010 |quote=Cellino è presidente dal 1992 del Cagliari, club che rilevò dai fratelli Orrù. |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has served as vice-president for [[Serie A]] in the [[Lega Nazionale Professionisti|Lega Calcio]].

During his years as owner of Cagliari Calcio, Cellino was instrumental in the building of their sports centre in [[Assemini]], near Cagliari, named after his father Ercole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Hughes |title=Man who lured Gianfranco Zola back home is latest bidder for West Ham |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/west_ham/article6987216.ece |work=The Times |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=23 January 2010 |quote=Cellino has proved himself to be a popular and successful owner at Cagliari, providing the finance for the club’s new training ground and sports complex in Assemini .... | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luis Diego López|Diego López]] was sacked by Cellino as Cagliari manager on 6 April 2014, this being the 36th manager change he went through in 22 years of his tenure at Cagliari Calcio. Cellino earned the nickname ''Il mangia-allenatori'', "The Manager Eater".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2598466/Massimo-Cellino-sacks-Diego-Lopez-Cagliari-coach-just-hours-sealing-Leeds-takeover.html|title=Cellino sacks Lopez as Cagliari coach just hours after sealing Leeds takeover|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=7 April 2014|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29787237|title=The sack race: Are chairmen running out of patience?|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 October 2014|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellino intended to sell Cagliari Calcio, and has said that an agreed sale failed due to the wish of the prospective buyers for him to stay and run the club. He finally sold the club to the Italian entrepreneur Tommaso Giulini on June 2014 after 22 years of ownership.&lt;ref name="YEPApr11"/&gt;

===Leeds United===
In January 2014, speculation grew that Leeds would be subject to takeover by Cellino. A delegation representing Cellino was seen at [[Elland Road]], Leeds' stadium, and the [[Thorp Arch (training ground)|Thorp Arch]] training ground several times, and on 28 January it was reported that Cellino had asked for his associate and former Middlesbrough defender [[Gianluca Festa]] to sit in the dugout for Leeds' 1–1 draw with Ipswich.&lt;ref name="Sky News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11715/9143857/consortium-looks-to-re-open-leeds-takeover-talks-as-cellino-closes-on-deal|title=Consortium looks to re-open Leeds takeover talks as Cellino closes on deal |publisher=Sky News|date= |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellino had previously tried to buy [[West Ham United]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=YEPApr11/&gt;

After weeks of speculation the club announced, on 7 February 2014, that they had exchanged contracts with Cellino's family consortium Eleonora Sport Ltd. The deal would see the Cellino family acquire 75% ownership of the club, subject to approval from the Football League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/article/16cr3klmb3cpp1xljskfrgkd8q/title/statements-from-our-owners|title=STATEMENTS FROM OUR OWNERS |publisher=Leeds United|date=7 February 2014 |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26084726|title=SLeeds United exchange contracts on Massimo Cellino takeover |publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 February 2014 |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Football League rejected the proposal on 24 March 2014, stating that Cellino failed the owner's test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/footballleaguenews/20140324/football-league-statement-massimo-cellino_2293334_3729469|title=Latest Football League News|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328091305/http://www.football-league.co.uk/footballleaguenews/20140324/football-league-statement-massimo-cellino_2293334_3729469|archivedate=28 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellino exercised his right to appeal the Football Leagues's decision. His appeal was heard on 31 March 2014 by an independent QC and, on 5 April 2014, the decision was overturned as Cellino's recent conviction did not involve conduct that would 'reasonably be considered to be dishonest' based on information available to him at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11715/9250458/sky-bet-championship-massimo-cellino-wins-appeal-against-football-league&lt;/ref&gt; GFH retained a 10 per cent stake in the club, with minority shareholders holding 25 per cent.&lt;ref name=YEPApr11/&gt;

Cellino later said that had he known that the takeover would not proceed smoothly he would not have bought the club and described the Football League as "...really tricky, they made trouble at a time when I couldn't walk away and I submitted myself to a trial, a humiliation...I don't want to be here if the Football League don’t want me but who are they anyway?...They are acting for what's right, the principles, the ideals. Me, I sort out the f*cking problems at Leeds. I prefer to play by the rules, not to cheat."&lt;ref name=YEPApr11/&gt; Cellino has been disparaging of GFH's management of Leeds, saying that "...You can see what’s been happening here – it's been done by people who knew they weren't staying. And now I have to clean up the sh*t...GFH made big mistakes but not on purpose. That's why I don’t go against them for the moment. But the men who were here in GFH's name did a really, really bad job. That's not GFH fault. They trust people they shouldn't."&lt;ref name=YEPApr11/&gt; Cellino described the fans of Leeds as "...tired of eating sh*t and shutting their mouths. They accept me with enthusiasm and that gives me a lot of responsibility. I'm the richest man in the world with these fans and I can challenge anyone, everyone."&lt;ref name=YEPApr11/&gt;

Cellino later questioned manager Brian McDermott's decision to take a holiday, proclaiming that Leeds "have no manager", and asked "Who's managing this club?' Brian, where's Brian?".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=New Leeds owner Massimo Cellino says United has no manager|url=http://www.itv.com/news/calendar/2014-05-14/exclusive-interview-new-leeds-owner-massimo-cellino-says-united-has-no-manager/|work=ITV |date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also revealed that the retain and release list of players would be handled by Cellino and [[Benito Carbone]] and not McDermott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Carbone’s role with Leeds United confirmed|url=http://www.morleyobserver.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/carbone-s-role-with-leeds-united-confirmed-1-6619156 |work=Morley Observer|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leeds later confirmed Carbone's position at the club in a statement, confirming that he would 'be involved with all football matters, including both the first team and the academy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Cellino aimed to repurchase Leeds' [[Elland Road]] stadium in 2014, and expects the club to be in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of English football, by the end of the 2015–16 season.&lt;ref name=YEPApr11/&gt; In September 2014, Cellino appointed [[Darko Milanič]] as the new head coach of Leeds on a two-year deal replacing Hockaday,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/article/l9x1e0mkjtui12nhj4m267y8n/title/united-confirm-darko-milanic | title = UNITED CONFIRM DARKO MILANIC| publisher = Leeds United Official Website  | date = 23 September 2014 | accessdate = 23 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though Milanič was dismissed 32 days later after not winning one of his six games while in charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29774801|title=Darko Milanic: Leeds United part company with head coach|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 October 2014|accessdate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014 [[Neil Redfearn]] was confirmed as the new head coach of Leeds, on an initial 12-month contract with the option of a further 12 months, the contract also had a clause that would see Redfearn return to the academy if he was to leave his role as head coach.

On 1 December 2014, Cellino was disqualified by the [[Football League]] and asked to resign from the club. The Football League took the decision after obtaining documents from an Italian court, where he was found guilty of tax evasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30276764|title=Leeds owner Massimo Cellino disqualified by Football League|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 January 2015, Cellino's appeal against the Football League's disqualification was rejected, with the appeal committee ruling that his ban would stand.

However, Cellino, and the club, were facing another charge which related to the length of time it took Cellino to present [[The Football League]] with the court documents in the first place. This was settled in March 2015, and resulted in Cellino having his ban extended until 8 May 2015, the day after the 2014–15 season ended, to which Cellino responded by saying that he would return to his president role at the club once the ban expired.

On the 2nd April, During Cellino's ban away from the club, Cellino's sporting director [[Nicola Salerno (sporting executive)|Nicola Salerno]] mysteriously suspended [[Steve Thompson (footballer, born 1964)|Steve Thompson]], Leeds assistant manager who was credited with lifting Leeds from a place above relegation to 10th in the Football Championship. Leeds had won 6 out of the previous 10 matches. On 9 April 2015, Leeds United's suspended owner, Cellino, informed the press that he believed Salerno had resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/2091921https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/02/leeds-assistant-manager-steve-thompson |title=Leeds United suspend assistant manager Steve Thompson |date=2 April 2015 |work=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellino, with the approval of the Football League returned to the club, rejoining the board as club chairman and president on 2 May 2015.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

On 14 May 2015, Cellino carried out a press conference unveiling [[Adam Pearson]] as the club's Executive Director to work directly alongside Cellino. The press conference included Cellino leaving halfway through for a cigarette break only to return, and for the press conference to run for over an hour, with Cellino refusing to reveal the future of Head Coach Neil Redfearn. Cellino revealed that he would also sell the club if he felt he was not ready to take the club to the premier league by 2016/17 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Leeds United: Redfearn future unclear after Cellino press conference |date=14 May 2015|accessdate=|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/latest-whites-news/video-leeds-united-redfearn-future-unclear-after-cellino-press-conference-1-7261051|publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post|author=Leon Wobschall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, ex-[[Leeds United]]-women's forward and former Education &amp; Welfare officer [[Lucy Ward (footballer)|Lucy Ward]] won a high-profile legal battle against her dismissal from the club in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3635156/Leeds-owner-Massimo-Cellino-does-U-turn-giving-evidence-case-against-Lucy-Ward-press-attention-concerns.html|title=Lucy Ward case could cost Leeds United more than £500,000 as owner Massimo Cellino performs U-turn in giving evidence due to 'press attention' concerns|author=Jack Gaughan|publisher=Daily Mail|date=10 June 2016|accessdate=10 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 2016, [[Garry Monk]] was appointed the new head coach of Leeds United on a one-year rolling contract, replacing Evans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Garry Monk: Leeds United appoint former Swansea City boss|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36433909|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 June 2016|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September 2016, Cellino's Eleonora Sport Ltd became Leeds United's 100% share owners, after buying the 15% shares of minority owner [[Gulf Finance House]] (GFH Capital), thus becoming Leeds United's sole majority shareholder.

On 4 January 2017, [[Andrea Radrizzani]] purchased a 50 percent stake from Cellino for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leeds United: Owner Massimo Cellino sells 50% stake to Italian businessman|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38511004|accessdate=4 January 2017|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brescia===
After leaving Leeds, Cellino returned to Italy and purchased [[Serie B]] Side Brescia.

==Convictions and arrests==
Cellino was arrested in February 2013 with the mayor of Quartu Sant'Elena, Mauro Contini, and the public works commissioner Stefano Lilliu, for attempted embezzlement and fraudulent misrepresentation following an investigation into the construction of the [[Stadio Is Arenas]].&lt;ref name=IndFeb4&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/who-is-massimo-cellino-the-controversial-italian-vying-to-take-over-leeds-united-9107541.html|title=Who is Massimo Cellino?

Cellino's arrest warrant called him a man of "marked criminal tendencies ... capable of using every kind of deception to achieve his ends".&lt;ref name=IndFeb4/&gt; Cellino has two prior criminal convictions, for deceiving the Italian Ministry of Agriculture out of £7.5m in 1996 and for false accounting at Cagliari in 2001.&lt;ref name=IndFeb4/&gt;

==Personal life==
Cellino has a deep suspicion of the number 17, which is considered unlucky in [[17 (number)|Italian culture]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} At Cagliari's stadium Cellino had the number 17 removed from seats and replaced with 16b.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11715/9155007/leeds-united-confirm-sale-of-75-per-cent-to-massimo-cellino|title=Leeds United confirm sale of 75 per cent to Massimo Cellino |publisher=Sky Sports|date=7 February 2014 |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellino also has a dislike for the colour purple, which is also considered unlucky in Italy, see [http://www.lifeinitaly.com/potpourri/italiansuperstitions.asp Italian superstitions].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/latest-whites-news/phil-hay-leeds-united-looking-for-purple-patch-on-field-but-maybe-not-off-it-1-6411105|title=Leeds United looking for purple patch on field – but maybe not off it |publisher=Sky Sports|date=31 January 2014 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 May 2014, Leeds United retired the number 17 shirt due to superstitious reasons for Cellino.

'''Milos Krofta'''(July 23, 1912 - 2002) was a Slovenian engineer and businessman. He developed the technology of dissolved air flotation mainly for the paper industry, in aim to improve the water reuse and to reach the goal of zero discharge. He founded the Lenox Institute for Water Technology, an educational institution for the teaching of water treatment technologies, and was inducted in the Paper Industry International Hall of Fame in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paper Industry International Hall of Fame|url=http://www.paperhall.org/inductees/bios/1997/milos_krofta.php|work=Paper Industry International Hall of Fame|publisher=Paper Industry International Hall of Fame, Inc.|accessdate=3 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402033940/http://www.paperhall.org/inductees/bios/1997/milos_krofta.php|archivedate=2 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
His contribution to technological improvement in paper production and in the use of [[dissolved air flotation]] is so much eminent that the equipment itself is often named Krofta itself.

==Life and career==

Born in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]] on July 23, 1912, he studied mechanical engineering in both Ljubljana and [[Prague]]; after some years managing paper mills in Slovenia, he moved to [[Milan]], Italy in 1945 due to the political situation in his homeland. He started successfully operating as an engineering consultant and then moved to USA, where he moved in 1951; after the set up of Krofta Engineering Corporation, Dr. Krofta began to design and manufacture equipment for his customers. His improvements in hydraulic design resulted in major improvements in DAF technology performances in water clarification, both for the [[paper]] industry and different applications, with lower chemicals and energy consumption; the high efficiency of equipment like the Krofta Supercell allowed for high rate of pulp recovery and reuse of process water, reaching the goal of zero discharge for a water demanding industry. Milos Krofta started several branches in the world and founded the Lenox Institute for Water Technology, a non-profit educational and research unit based in [[Lenox, MA]]; Krofta companies, his patents and legacy are now part of Krofta  .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krofta.com|title=Krofta Company Website|last=Krofta, MA, USA|first=|date=|website=Krofta.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3557">'''Percy Nilsson''' (born 22 May 1943 in [[Malmö]]) is a Swedish businessman, constructor and sports person. He is most notable for his long-term chairmanship of [[Malmö Redhawks]] and the construction of [[Malmö Arena]] by his company Parkfast AB.

==Career==
Percy Nilsson is an educated [[carpenter]], Nilsson has also been a [[nightclub]] owner.&lt;ref name="Fokus" /&gt; He soon started his own construction company, Percy Nilsson Bygg (PNB). PNB was sold by Nilsson in 2004, although he had sold the company previously in the 1990s and later bought back a 50% stock share. PNB went bankrupt shortly after the sale and Nilsson was held accountable by his guaranty, Nilsson paid 112 million [[Swedish krona|kronor]] to various creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/ekonomi/byggjatten-pnb-i-konkurs/ | title=Byggjätten PNB i konkurs | publisher=Sydsvenskan | work=www.sydsvenskan.se | date=31 December 2011 | accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malmö Redhawks===
Percy Nilsson was elected chairman of [[ice hockey]] club [[Malmö Redhawks]] in 1984. Percy Nilsson contributed large funds to the club to turn around its bad financial situation. The bid turned out to be successful as Redhawks was promoted to the highest tier of Swedish ice hockey, [[Swedish Hockey League|Elitserien]] in 1990. The club also became [[List of Swedish ice hockey champions|Swedish champions]] in 1992 and 1994. The club was relegated to [[HockeyAllsvenskan]] again in 2005 but returned to the highest tier in 2006 when it was relegated after one season.

Nilsson resigned as chairman of Redhawks in 2005 as he had been sentenced to a one-year prison sentence for dubious disbursements on 27 April 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=101&amp;artikel=603651 | title=Ett års fängelse för Percy Nilsson | publisher=Sveriges Radio | work=sverigesradio.se | date=27 April 2005 | accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nilsson was later fully acquitted on 1 March 2006 after the case had been appealed to [[Hovrätt]]en.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/percy-nilsson-friades-i-hovratten/ | title=Percy Nilsson friades i hovrätten | publisher=Sydsvenskan | work=www.sydsvenskan.se | date=4 March 2006 | accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nilsson returned to the chairman post in 2007 but later resigned again in 2008 after the club had failed to be promoted to Elitserien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sport/ishockey/redhawks/percy-nilsson-avgar/ | title=Percy Nilsson avgår | publisher=Sydsvenskan | work=www.sydsvenskan.se | date=15 August 2008 | accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malmö Arena===
Percy Nilsson bought land at [[Hyllievång]] in [[Malmö]] from [[Malmö Municipality|Malmö Stad]] for 250 million [[Swedish krona|kronor]] in 2007. A couple of days later Nilsson sold the majority of the land to retail concern [[Steen &amp; Strom ASA|Steen &amp; Strøm]] for as much as 570 million kronor. The profit was used by Nilsson to fund the construction of [[Malmö Arena]].&lt;ref name="Fokus"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fokus.se/2009/03/percy-nilsson-byggherre-och-vaktmastare/ | title=Percy Nilsson, byggherre och vaktmästare | publisher=Fokus | work=fokus.se | date=13 March 2009 | accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GWUP 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Gesellschaft zur wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung von Parawissenschaften|GWUP]] is an e.{{nnbsp}}V. registered in Germany, but it operates in Austria and Switzerland as well]]

An '''''{{lang|de|eingetragener Verein}}''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈaɪnɡəˌtʁaːɡənɐ fɛʁˈʔaɪn|lang}}, ''registered association'' or ''incorporated association''), abbreviated '''''e.{{nnbsp}}V.''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈeː ˈfaʊ|lang}}), is a legal status for a [[Civil registration|registered]] [[voluntary association]] in [[Germany]]. While any group may be called a ''{{lang|de|Verein}}'', registration as ''{{lang|de|eingetragener Verein}}'' holds many legal benefits because a registered association may legally function as a corporate body ([[juridical person]]) rather than just a group of individuals. The legal status must be mentioned in the name as well.

==Membership==

All natural and legal persons in Germany, including entities such as municipalities, counties and other entities under public law, can form associations and be member of an association. The statutory minimum number of members for forming a registered association is 7.

This means that associations are not limited to private clubs formed by natural persons but have a much broader scope.

==Associations and partnerships==

The [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Civil Code of Germany]] contains different regulations for registered non-profit and for-profit associations regarded as juridical persons (''{{lang|de|Vereine}}'', articles 21{{ndash}}79) on the one hand and for not necessarily registered associations by contract (''{{lang|de|Gesellschaften}}'', articles 705{{ndash}}740) on the other hand. The Verein is the basic type of a juridical person while the Gesellschaft is dogmatically more a partnership. Due to this theoretical distinction, the concept of Verein is also the legal basis for economic entities such as GmbH and Aktiengesellschaft. They are regulated in separate statutes as special economic associations but bear the same basic features.

In other German-speaking countries such a distinction does not exist. But there may be legal requirements which oblige an association to register itself; for example, in [[Switzerland]] if it must be audited (''{{lang|de|Revisionspflicht}}''). In Austria, all associations are registered in a special register, and having an e.{{nnbsp}}V. in the name is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/BMI_Vereinswesen/faq/Frage_01.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Revenue assurance (RA)''' is a niche business activity most commonly undertaken within businesses that provide [[telecommunication]] services.
The activity is the use of [[data quality]] and process improvement methods that improve [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]s, [[revenue]]s and [[cash flow]]s without influencing demand.  This was defined by a TM Forum working group based on research documented in its Revenue Assurance Technical Overview [http://www.tmforum.org/browse.aspx?catid=865&amp;linkID=30508].
In many telecommunications service providers, revenue assurance is led by a dedicated revenue assurance department.

==Overview==
"Revenue assurance" is a broad umbrella term.  It is used both to describe an activity performed within telecommunications service providers, and is a common name for a small business unit associated with that activity.  Revenue assurance is a practical response to perceived or actual issues with operational under performance, most commonly relating to billing and collection of revenue.  Some of the procedures associated with identifying, remedying or preventing errors may be undertaken by a dedicated Revenue Assurance department, though responsibility for revenue assurance is often diffuse and varies greatly with the organizational structure of the provider.  Assuming a provider with a typical organizational split, responsibilities for revenue assurance primarily sit between the Finance and Technology directorates, however, revenue assurance initiatives are often started in a business unit or marketing group.

The relevance to Finance rests with the responsibility for financial control, audit and reporting, while the subject matter would be network and IS systems as implemented or operated by the Technology side of the business.  Marketing groups and / or business units (e.g. wholesale or retail business lines) will often embark on revenue assurance projects in an effort to improve product line margins.  Furthermore, marketing and business units are pivotal in providing input into the "should be" state of customer bills and products.

The sphere of influence described by revenue assurance varies greatly between telecommunications service providers, but is usually closely related to back office functions where small errors may have a disproportionately large impact on revenues or costs.  The processing of transaction data in modern telecommunications providers exhibits many attributes akin to a [[complex system]].  However, there is significant disagreement about the ultimate aims and legitimate scope of revenue assurance teams.  This is in part caused by:

(1) the cross-functional nature of the activity and the consequent need for a variety of skills from IT, marketing, finance, et al.;

(2) the difficulty of generalizing across businesses with different objectives and business models;

(3) political infighting within each telco about responsibility for revenue leakages and assurance; and

(4) the difficulty in reliably measuring the value added by revenue assurance as separable from underlying performance.

There is high-level agreement between practitioners about the goals and methods of revenue assurance, though reaching a consensus on defining the boundaries of revenue assurance has proved elusive so far.  The goals relate to improving the financial performance by eliminating mistakes in the processing of transaction data.  Some take a more encompassing view of what counts as a mistake, which may extend as far as questioning the policy set by executives even when this has been executed correctly.  Others take a more open-ended view of the data that is the subject matter.  For example, in decreasing order of frequency, revenue assurance may cover:

(1) revenues from retail and corporate sales;

(2) revenues and costs from interconnect and wholesale contracts; and

(3) margins and profitability of investment in networks and information systems.

Other markets have different or more refined priorities.  For example, in the U.S.A. management of wholesale contracts has often been the first objective because of the complexity of the domestic market resulting from the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s regulatory framework.  In contrast, telcos in developing countries may prioritize management of international interconnect arrangements because of the risks posed by fraud and arbitrage.  A cable supplier or [[internet service provider]] that predominantly offers retail customers flat monthly charges and no limits on usage may be most interested in assuring the profitability of network investments.

Revenue assurance is often regarded by practitioners as a low-cost mechanism to generate significant financial returns for telecommunications service providers.   However, the returns are unpredictable as well as being hard to measure, which encourages many executives to take a sceptical view of its worth.  Comparable revenue assurance activities do occur in other industries, such as with billing of utilities or with the licensing of software, and there are many parallels with financial and operational control activities undertaken by most large businesses.  The rationale for why revenue assurance has come to be considered particularly important in telecommunications, unlike other industries, is disputed.  Reasonable conjectures are that:

(1) the fast pace of change and intense commercial competition increase the likelihood of mistakes;

(2) there is significant complexity in determining the combined effect of interacting systems and processes; and

(3) the high-volume, low-value nature of transactions amplifies the financial implications of "small" errors.

Another conjecture is that revenue assurance is a response to changing market conditions.  The thinking is that as markets reach saturation and growth potential falls off, so the value of maximizing returns from existing sales increases.  This observation has some merit but does not explain the increasing popularity of revenue assurance in telcos serving growth markets.  It also in part contradicts the assumption of a compelling costs versus benefits argument for revenue assurance, which would be enhanced in businesses undergoing rapid change.  It is also important to recognize that there is a long history of revenue assurance activities in some telcos that predates the coining of the term "revenue assurance".

The revenue assurance techniques applied in practice cover a broad spectrum, from analysis and implementation of business controls to automated data interrogation.  At one end of the spectrum, revenue assurance can appear very similar to the kinds of review and process mapping techniques applied for other financial controlling objectives like accounting integrity, as exemplified by those derived from clause 404 of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]].  This form of revenue assurance is most commonly promoted by consultancies.  The size of such consultancies covers the entire range; the Big 4 all offer some form of revenue assurance consulting, but there are also niche specialist consultancies.  At the other end of the spectrum, revenue assurance is treated as a form of reactive automated data interrogation, seeking to find anomalies in transaction data that may indicate errors and potential revenue loss.  This form of revenue assurance is most commonly promoted by software houses that aim to provide databases and configurable tools to extract and interrogate a telco's source data.  A less popular form of reactive automated assurance involves using both software and specialised hardware as a means of extracting additional data on transactions, for example by creating actual network events or interfacing directly with network elements to replicate dummy events.  As with consultancies, IT-oriented revenue assurance solutions are offered by both large vendors like providers of billing and mediation software, and by specialized niche providers.

There is some debate about the relative merits of the different techniques that can be employed in revenue assurance.

As yet, there is no professional body, no qualifications, and no academic research that would help to drive consensus about the purpose or methods of revenue assurance.  In part this is addressed by individuals working in the sector through membership and qualification in related fields such as accountancy and information systems audit.  Some scientific research in other fields is also applicable to revenue assurance, though most revenue assurance "facts" rely heavily on anecdotes and oft-repeated truisms.  Some of the most helpful and progressive initiatives in addressing the problem of consensus and scientific basis are listed below.

==The value of revenue assurance==
Revenue assurance is usually understood as a means to identify and remedy, and perhaps also to prevent, problems that result in financial under performance without seeking to generate additional sales.  The most common metaphor is that of leaking water from a pipe, where water stands in place of revenues or cash flows, and the leaks represent waste.  The value of revenue assurance is hence determined by the size of the leaks "plugged", and possibly also those leaks prevented before they occur, although estimating the value of the latter is very problematic.  The value added also includes the recovery of "lost" revenues or costs (through issuing additional bills, chasing uncollected payments, renegotiating with suppliers a refund of costs etc.) after the fact.  This last form of reactive revenue assurance is the easiest to put a value to, but is in many ways the least efficient form of revenue assurance; effort is directed towards repeatedly addressing the consequences of known flaws, and not on addressing the flaws themselves.  This can lead to a parasitical relationship between a Revenue Assurance department or vendor and the wider business, where the department/vendor finds it easiest to justify its ongoing existence/contract by repeatedly fixing symptoms and not the root causes.

The TM Forum conducted a benchmark survey in 2008 that concluded average leakage, not including losses due to fraud, was 1% of the gross revenues for those telcos that took part.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tmforum.org/TMForumPressReleases/RevenueAssuranceStudy/36002/article.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of participating telcos was relatively small compared to some other surveys, but the survey technique was more demanding than any comparable survey to date.  The survey used the most detailed and prescriptive definition of how to calculate leakage of any survey of its type.  The definition was taken from the TM Forum's own standard on how to calculate revenue assurance metrics [http://www.tmforum.org/DocumentsRevenue/GB941ARevenueAssurance/33545/article.html].  To increase confidence that participants calculated their leakages correctly, the TM Forum's benchmark program independently reviewed the results and corroborated them with representatives of the participating companies.  The survey's average of 1% leakage of gross revenue, whilst still significant, is notably lower than many other quoted estimates and reported survey findings about average leakage.  This may be because the survey used a very strict definition of leakage. The survey measured only actual under-billed and unbilled amounts discovered by the participants; it excluded other types of leakages such as cost leakages and loss of opportunity leakages, and it excluded projected leakage estimations that are commonly used (i.e., what would have been the amount of leakage, if the leakage would not been discovered by revenue assurance activities).  It may also reflect a reduction in bias or exaggeration in reported leakages, or at least the exclusion of guesswork.  Respondents were given authoritative instructions on how to quantify leakage based on actual data and were instructed to avoid making suppositions in the absence of such data.

The best known estimates of "typical" revenue leakage come from a series of annual surveys conducted by the Analysys consultancy and research business. In these surveys, leakage was commonly estimated as being worth between 5% and 15% of the total revenue of the business.  Similar research by other businesses has generated results in the same range, with none concluding leakage of less than 1% of gross revenue, and some suggesting leakage of 20% or more was not uncommon.  Reasons to doubt these estimates are as follows:

(1) All the estimates of leakage were derived from the subjective opinions of staff working in service providers;

(2) All the research was conducted by businesses wishing to promote their revenue assurance products;

(3) Increased annual spend on revenue assurance has not resulted in a clear downward trend in estimates;

(4) The estimates were broadly similar even when the criteria for what losses to include varied greatly; and

(5) Genuine losses of this scale should be a severe corporate governance issue in any publicly listed business.

What can be said with some confidence is that revenue assurance practitioners are able to provide a vast number of consistent anecdotes relating to the causes of leakage and means to resolve them.  Though there is little objective evidence relating to actual leakages approaching this scale in the public domain as this information per se is highly confidential, there are some indirect measures of data integrity that help give a sense of potential leakage.  For example, in reconciling interconnect costs and revenues between telcos, a 5% variance is the common practice to accept before a disputed invoice can lead one party to withhold payment, and a 0.5% variance would be considered industry-leading practice according to best practice advice issued by the [http://www.revenueassurancegroup.net/ UK Revenue Assurance Group].

==Revenue Assurance in Telecom==
Although Revenue Assurance has always been present in the telecom parlance{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} it has recently been brought at the forefront of the top management{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}. This is due to several factors including
* Profit: Increasing cost pressures and decreasing margins.  The high profit days for most telcos are over{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}. They all need to find alternative means to squeeze higher margins by effectively tracking their revenue. 
* Regulatory: New regulatory structure and compliance requirements{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} which force the telecom operators to report their revenue accurately.
* Technology Innovation: Ensuring new technologies and products are performing as per perceived plans. Keeping up with release of new technologies along with co-existing of legacy systems.
* Mergers and Acquisitions: With increase in the number of telco mergers and acquisitions, organizations are finding it very difficult handle multiple BSS systems including Billing, Mediation and Rating together etc. 
Revenue Assurance has been a problem for the telecom companies since the very early stages. Tracking of pulses, minutes, counts, bytes etc. has never been more difficult. One would think these would be easy for the tech-savvy telco companies. However, the truth has been just the opposite. In a hurry to release new technologies in the market, the Revenue Assurance systems are always lagging behind. Revenue Assurance in a telco environment covers a wide range of technical and business aspects. An RA operator needs to be aware of both OSS &amp; BSS processes and internal dependencies to accurately decipher the revenue code.

===What causes the problem ===
A telecom organization's revenue chain is usually a very complex set of inter-related technologies and processes providing a seamless set of services to the end consumer. As the set of technologies and business processes grows bigger and more complex, the chance of failure increases in each of its connections. A revenue leakage is typically attributed to when a telco organization is unable to bill correctly for a given service or to receive the correct payment. As the organization grows the probability of revenue leakage only increases.

===Where is the problem ===
The most debated part of revenue assurance is where to start checking, i.e. at the network side, the rating side, the billing side, the interconnect side, the CRM side, etc. However, most surveys and reports state that the maximum leakage happens during the flow of Call Detail Records (CDRs) or Event Detail Records (EDRs) from the Switch to the respective rating / billing engines. Some of the common problem areas are :		
* Network	
   * Signaling problems
   * CDRs in Switch not sent to Mediation	
   * CDRs in Mediation not send downstream	
   * CDRs rejected by rating / billing system
   * Wrong duration on the CDRs
   * Wrong TON value populated in the CDRs
   * Incorrect Business rules
   * Subscriber provisioning
   * Incorrect Routing
* Rating &amp; Billing
   * Incorrect Rejection Logic
   * Duplicate CDRs resulting in double charging
   * Incorrect tariff plans
   * Rating &amp; Billing accuracy errors
   * Late rating / billing
   * Incorrect configurations – rating minutes instead of seconds
   * Incorrect Disconnection

==Revenue assurance as a discipline==
Among the disciplines in revenue assurance are:

1. The CORE functions of a revenue assurance group: Monitoring, Baselining, Auditing, Synchronizing, Investigating and Compliance.&lt;br/&gt;
2. Decomposing an organization's revenue assurance scope (The Revenue Management Chain).&lt;br/&gt;
3. Assessing and minimizing revenue loss risk.

==Maturity of Revenue Assurance==

There is no formal maturity model for Revenue Assurance which is universally accepted. However the Revenue Assurance processes can be pegged against a generic five stage maturity model. The five stages are listed below and are described in terms of a Revenue Assurance Strategy, People, Process and technological advances.

[[File:RA maturity.JPG|thumb|Revenue Assurance Maturity Stages]]

* Initial: At this level that they are (typically) un-documented and in a state of dynamic change, tending to be driven in an ad hoc, uncontrolled and reactive manner by users or events. This provides a chaotic or unstable environment for the Revenue Assurance processes. At this stage there is no formalized Revenue Assurance strategy in place. Teams run adhoc queries on various systems. It depends entirely on personal ideas &amp; initiatives. It encompasses substantial manual effort. There are undocumented repeat processes.
* Repeatable: At this level that some processes are repeatable, possibly with consistent results. Process discipline is unlikely to be precise. This is where the Revenue Assurance functions starts to take some shape in defined procedures and outputs. However they still don’t cover the entire revenue spectrum of the telecommunications company nor do they cover all aspects of a specific revenue stream. People are still learning the skill set of revenue assurance. There are specific measurement and analysis outcomes received at this stage.	
* Defined: At this level that there are sets of defined and documented standard Revenue Assurance processes established and subject to some degree of improvement over time. These standard processes are in place (i.e., they are the AS-IS processes) and used to establish consistency of process performance across the organization. There are specific tools for Revenue Assurance identified and implemented. There is clear sense of what revenue chain coverage does, what the Revenue Assurance department cover and road maps are in place for the future. All major revenue streams are covered by now. There is a formalized and approved Revenue Assurance charter and strategy in place. There is a specific year on year budget for the department.
* Managed: At this level with the use of process metrics, management can effectively control the Revenue Assurance AS-IS process (e.g., for Issue Detection, Root Cause Analysis, Closure). There is a formalized strategy and long term road map for people, process and technology for the revenue assurance department.  In particular, management can identify ways to adjust and adapt the process to particular Revenue Streams without measurable losses of quality or deviations from specifications. Process Capability is established from this level. The people have the right skill set to execute daily operations and have subject matter expertise.
* Optimizing: At this level that the focus is on continually improving process performance through both incremental and innovative technological changes/improvements. A risk based strategy is in place to evaluate the coverage of Revenue Assurance at specific intervals of time. Controls reach a maturity where Revenue Assurance only acts as an improvement agency for other process areas including product development, product deployment, customer retention, billing, collections, dunning etc. At this stage the RA processes are concerned with addressing statistical common causes of process variation and changing the process to improve process performance.

==RA Process Categories==

The Revenue Assurance processes in many ways can be regarded as an auditing process. The objective is to ensure that policies of the organization are well implemented and that no or minimal revenue leakage is occurring. The RA processes have the capability to cover all departments and service lines in a telecommunications organization. There are many ways in which RA processes can be classified, however in view of an audit function; the RA processes can be categorized into Detective, Corrective and Preventive activities, controls or processes.  Let's understand the difference with the help of an example. Supposing the objective is to ensure trunk groups correctly entered in the MSCs. The detective control would be to monitor Trunk Groups appearing in CDRs are harmonized with the master list and any deviations are reported. The corrective control would be to initiative a process and confirm with the Network / Wholesale team of all deviations found. The preventive control would be to set up a process with the Network / Wholesale team where all new trunk groups are first informed to the RA, Mediation, Wholesale and other essential departments and then made live on the Network.

===Detective Processes===

Revenue Assurance Detection is the process of spotting a change in value of a dimension relative to its movement from System A to System B or within a given systems itself. The change in the value is relative to a dimension is question. Detection in RA can be achieved by both manual and automated means. Typical detection activities include monitoring, summarization, investigation and auditing.
* Monitoring: Typically monitoring activities in Revenue Assurance refers to observing data, system or a process for any changes which may occur over a period of time. With the use of automated tools one can typically achieve constant monitoring which can notify the user or administrator (via email, SMS or other alarms)  in case of any changes. The various processes which typically are monitored by a Revenue Assurance department include daily network usage, profile and configuration changes, mediation, rating, billing, settlement, roaming, collections and dunning related processes. 
* Summarization: When dealing with large volumes of information like network usage, it may not be practical to go through CDR by CDR and compare the same between 2 systems. In such cases summarization will help in quickly examining and finding out the preliminary problems areas. For example, one could first summarize information on the basis of few dimensions like events ( voice, sms, data), customer type (postpaid, prepaid, in roamer, out roamer), operator (self, local, national, international)  etc. and compare the measures like count and duration of these dimensions between 2 systems. Such rapid assessments help in identifying the problem areas or dimensions quickly and a further detailed investigation can be carried out for those dimensions identified. Summarization greatly reduces the manual effort in identifying problem areas within a large data stream. 
* Auditing: A revenue assurance audit is a set of activities carried out to ensure that the organization is taking necessary steps to remain compliant to the evolving changes of organizational policies, regulations and market conditions. Every Revenue Assurance audit has a list of specific objectives which may come from management, regulations or industry standards. The actual tasks of the audit can differ based on the information, system or departmental processes being audited. Some sample RA audit objectives could be like ensuring billing accuracy up to 0.01%, no configuration variances on the Network, rating &amp; invoicing process assurance etc. Each RA audit can span into different departments, each with its own specialized technical requirements.  
* Investigation: Investigation is the act of detecting something new, or something "old" that had been unknown. Investigation leads to discovery which is the observation of new actions, or new events and providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered.  An RA investigation is a series of processes or procedures carried out to identify the Root Cause of an anomaly. This is also known as Root Causes Analysis (RCA) procedures or activities.  Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a method of problem solving that tries to identify the root causes of faults or problems that cause operating events. An investigation would try to identify and correct the root causes of events, as opposed to simply addressing their symptoms. By focusing on correction of root causes, revenue assurance problem recurrence can be prevented.

===Corrective Processes===

Correction is the set of activities and processes related around getting the process structures correct in order to minimize the changes identified as per the detection techniques. Correction itself is the act or method of correcting a discrepancy. Typically some information, configuration, amount or quantity needs to be added, edited or removed from a system, process or procedure in order to correct the anomaly. In Revenue Assurance activities, the process of correction of a root cause could involve correction of information, processes, technology or people. 
* Information Correction: This refers to the process of correcting or updating a value for a configuration element or a reference table.  This is typically the result of a missing data set in a particular given table or system file. For example, a particular number series may be missing in the Switch and hence not getting connected or updating a missing tariff plan in rating engine leading to unrated CDRs etc. 
* Process Correction: Process correction refers to the modification of an activity by adding, modifying or removing an activity step which will prevent a miss-configuration or revenue leakage in the process. Typically process correction is required to have a pro-active revenue assurance step to provide better governance across the operations.  For example, the pre-bill verification process may be required to be modified when a new service line or product is introduced into the market. The new service line may be required to be included within the pre-bill process.
* People Correction: People correction is required when skills of the resources are in question. Revenue Assurance is a niche business process with limited people present with the right amount of Telecom Network, Mediation, Billing, IT and Business related experience. This leads to many Revenue Assurance teams with inexperienced people on operational departments. Owing to this, most Revenue Assurance operations end up being only re-active rather than moving into a proactive foundation.
* Technology Correction: The very nature of the telecom business changes frequently. There are 2 aspects to Technology correction i) The technology on the Network side ii) Technologies in use by the RA department themselves. 
Telecom Network technologies evolve at a rapid pace. Sometimes technologies need to be balanced in the Network. For example, having multiple vendors on the Network side could lead to a requirement of having time synchronizer equipment installed just to have CDRs showing consistent time and date related information.   
Any current implementation of Revenue Assurance becomes obsolete rapidly.  As technologies evolve revenue assurance tools and coverage of the tools also need to evolve.  This essentially means technology corrections need to be performed either on the hardware side or on the tool / application side. Technology corrections are rare and need to be performed with due diligence as technology corrections can be very expensive to an organization.

===Preventive Processes===

Prevention is the process of performing an activity in order to avoid a high risk situation. It is essentially an action carried out to de-risk a threat.  For example, if there is risk that a tariff plan is not correctly implemented, then the preventive action could be to simulate calls on test SIMs on the new tariff plans prior to launch and confirm the tariffs coming in the test CDRs against the marketing or advertising  department rates. Preventive activities lead to effective risk management around Revenue Assurance. 
* Synchronization - A set of activities which ensure that 2 data sets are synchronized over a period of time. For example, a set of Revenue Assurance activities would ensure that all prepaid customers on the CRM systems are represented in the IN - SDP (Intelligent Network) and vice versa. Similarly all trunk groups between the whole sale departments are in sync with the trunk groups mentioned in the MSCs.  Another example could be to ensure all B number tables between the MSCs are same.
* Integrity Checks - These are individual activities carried out to ensure the integrity of the system or process. This is an effective check in gaining insight into an individual process and to assess whether it has anything in their immediate background that may be a cause for concern.  For example, performing a sample based credit check for postpaid customers prior to generation of a bill.  Another example could be subscriber checks with sanction lists watch lists for involvement in/association with fraud, money laundering &amp; related illegal activities.
* Pre Process Checks - Any checks performed on the input parameters of a process to ensure that the right data is fed into the process. Pre Process checks are necessary for complex processes like rating and billing which involve multiple sub processes and consume a lot of time for each run. Some sample preprocess checks could include validation of CDR sequence number before rating, file count confirmation before rating, subscriber pre check before billing, duplicate CDR check, report all postpaid customers that do not have the correct bill cycle etc.
* Post Process Checks - Post process checks are required to verify the reliability on the outputs of a given process. Some processes of Revenue Assurance can produce multiple co-related outputs which need to be verified before being released to the consumer either internally or externally. Some examples of post process checks are formats checking on the target outputs like TAP 3 files, cross reference subscribers on the bill cycle with pre bill list, numbers terminated directly on OSS systems and not via CRM / BSS systems etc.

==Tool for Revenue Assurance==

Since Revenue Assurance is a very niche area in the telecommunications environment, there are some specific products and solutions supporting this subject. There are various vendors in the market which address either the complete suite of Revenue Assurance requirements or specialize in the specific domains.  This section describes the basic features of a generic Revenue Assurance tool.

One must keep in mind that software RA solutions can only help in pointing toward the error locations or problem areas. When one addresses the question of developing an RA solution they need to consider the magnitude, scope and capacity of the systems available along with the intellect, skills, and the number of people accessible. Finally it is the people, their skills and knowledge that make a complete RA solution. An organization should be careful when automating revenue assurance as it may end up with an expensive and inflexible solution which no one can manage effectively.
There are a variety of specialized RA products which have different characteristics including probing, RA add on modules on respective OSS / BSS elements. However the most common tool adopted by most Telecommunication companies is one which can simulate the natural process of the CDR flow from Network generation to Invoicing.  Given below are some of the requirements (not exhaustive) of such a Revenue Assurance product.

===Extract, Transform and Load===

Telecommunications is an environment where there are many heterogeneous systems creating a multitude of data. Typically a single day’s information runs into many Giga Bytes or in some cases Tera Bytes also. This creates a need to have very proficient and rigorous extraction, transformation and loading tool for a Revenue Assurance application. Some of the common features of this tool are:

*It should be able to import data in all common formats of data (ASCII, ASN, BCD, Binary etc.) 
* It should be able import data directly from common databases 
* It should have the ability to receive data feeds from various data sources of the Network, Operational and Business support systems
* It should have an extensive audit log to track files and records status - received, processing, duplicate, loading, error etc.
* The solution must provide an integrated environment to perform data integrity checks
* It should be configurable using a user friendly GUI.
* It should provide the ability to normalize, enrich and transform business rules as applicable into a data model 
* It should be able to look up large tables or files for reference information
* It should enable the creation of new data fields by manipulating and calculating values based on other fields 
* It should provide the capability to monitor the progress and success of the whole ETL process from start to end
* It should handle unexpected errors and continue processing and maintain the appropriate audit logs
* It should support full automation of the ETL procedure from file pick up to record entry in the DB or file system.
* It should have the ability to store historical summary and detail information for a period of time configurable by the user
* It should be able to summarize information on the fly based on configurable dimensions
* It should have the ability to configure ETL level alarms and thresholds on data and notify relevant users of any exceptions
* The solution must be highly scalable so that the data processing platform can be sized to accommodate current and projected, with business growth, traffic volumes &amp; audit points.

===Reconciliations===

One of the primary focus areas of a Revenue Assurance tool is to compare CDRs or XDRs from 2 different sources and checking if all the records from the first system have transferred properly to the second system keeping the appropriate business rules in consideration. This is achieved via comparative analysis of the records between the 2 systems either at the details record level or summary level by evaluating the common dimensions between the 2 data sets. Given below are some of the requirements (not exhaustive) which a Revenue Assurance Reconciliation side of the product should provide.	

* It should have a graphical user interface to enable the RA analysts to create/update reconciliation and business rules 
* It should support various reconciliation and controls rules types e.g. missing records, unmatched records, problems in source file (duplicates, invalid values) 
* It should be able to filter the data prior to the rule executing to ensure efficient system operation 
* It should be able to set effective start and end date from which a newer business rule will be applied and valid for.
* It should be to define rules using a naturalized user friendly language or a “drag and drop” GUI.
* It should be able to associate monetary values with discrepancies identified based on predefined business rules
* It should support the creation of a hierarchy of rules, when the results of a rule can become a source for further rules definition.

===Analysis and KPIs===

Once all the information has been received into the Revenue Assurance systems it time to crunch numbers and generate reports. The critical part is the analytical capabilities of the tool. The tool needs to have the ability to make sense of the problems in the vast set of data that it has gathered. This can only be done by a high performance analytical engine which should be capable of the following activities (non exhaustive):

* It should have the capability to create measures based on the output of selected reconciliation and control rules and/or other user-definable criteria e.g. Customer Account Number, Product Code 
* This tool should be able to create alerts based on the application of thresholds to measures and dynamically change the thresholds based on business logic
* It should be able to create KPIs based on various measures (such as count, sum, average, etc..) and multiple dimensions. 
* It should be able to showcase trends based on KPI values over the period of time and raise alarms when thresholds are crossed (for example alarms could be raised on a) Zero duration CDRs; b) Short duration calls; c) Long duration calls; d)Duration discrepancies; e) Invalid structure code/call types etc.)
* It should be able to forecast information based on past records and raise alarms or reports
* Users should be able to set thresholds of KPIs on the total value as well as on the value per specified dimension, e.g. the system should be able to alert on the situations when the threshold per a specific attribute is violated. 
* It should be able to categorize alerts and alarms based on priorities (e.g. critical, major, minor) 
* It should enable users to create new, and update and delete existing, KPIs and measures at any time through a simple graphical user interface. This should include full KPIs definition – calculation, dimensions, thresholds, calculation frequency. 
* The solution must have the ability to support detection, investigation, validation and correction of discrepancies resulting from audit comparisons
* It should be able to co-relate gaps in the reconciliations with missing profile information or missing reference information or other system errors and prepare a consolidated report.

===Dash boarding===

A Revenue Assurance dashboard is an easy to read, often single page, real-time user interface, showing a graphical presentation of the current status (snapshot) and historical trends of an organization’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to enable instantaneous and informed decisions to be made at a glance. For example, a prepaid dashboard may show KPIs related to prepaid CDRs reconciliation, prepaid user profile reconciliation, balance reconciliations and voucher reconciliations carried out in real time or near real time.

* It should be able to provide a fully personalized dashboard screen to present concise summary and/or detailed information 
* It should be composed of ‘building blocks’ or ‘sections’, each containing valuable information for the user e.g. summary of all currently defined dimensions &amp; measures 
* It should allow different building blocks to display the information of different types (e.g. grid tables, trend graphs, bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, gauges, URLs, Maps etc..). 
* It should enable each block or section to be linked on a functional level e.g. once a user selected a specific gauge, for example, in one building block, a specific relevant pre-defined table or graph in other building block(s), is being refreshed accordingly, to reflect the selection of the user 
* It should provide information on each source on the dashboard with drill down capabilities to investigate detailed information related to the building block whether presented with textual of graphical means 
* It should provide a designer module with full flexibility in defining data sources based on any information type stored in the RA database as well as the ability to use external information sources 
* It should enable users to search on a predefined set of fields within the source data for records using a complex combination of logical operators e.g. “=”, ”&lt;”, ”&gt;”, including wildcards 
* It should provide drill down capabilities from the list of records resultant from a search into specific record details.

===Case Management===
A case management capability in Revenue Assurance should be able to provide a 360 degree view of a given case. The tool should be able to track and resolve the identified discrepancies. The tool should handle each “case” in the system from the point where the system detected it, and manage follow up through the correction and reclamation processes, until the case is resolved. Based on a discrepancy in one given area, It should be able connect relevant information from various sources. For example, if a CDRs reconciliation has a problem, the case tool should be able to co-relate with respective user profiles, non-usage information, credits risks, network configurations etc.  The case management component may have some of the following non exhaustive capabilities:

* Ability to create a unique case identification reference for each discrepancy (or group of discrepancies) where user-defined criteria are met 
* It should enable users to manage and track cases by updating different case’s attributes such as: Status, Value, Priority, Assignee, Description, etc. 
* The user should have a full case history mechanism associated with cases and the case details. The history should be kept throughout the case life cycle including when the case is reopened by the system 
* It should be completely user-definable with content based on any data field available in the RA database by a simple drag and drop mechanism 
* It should enable users to include in case details all case related information and also any additional information (not necessarily case related) that can help in case analysis 
* It should enable users to create new fields in the case that will include either the automatically calculated value or will be opened for the user update. These fields should retain their value throughout the case life cycle 
* It should support case report output manipulation including sorting, multi-level grouping and filtering based on any one of the displayed attributes 
* It should have the ability to “multi-assign” cases (such as changing the assignee or closing a large number of cases) to one another
* It should enable users to print the displayed discrepancies and export them to Excel, Word, Csv and PDF etc. files with restrict user access so that they can only see and update only the cases that are assigned to them

General '''Sergei Ivanovich Mal'tsov''' ({{lang-ru| Сергей Иванович Мальцов}}) (1810-93) was a [[Russian people|Russian]] industrialist of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Агеев"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Агеев|first1=С.

His father, Ivan Akimovich Mal’tsov expanded the family business, previously based on glass and linen production by developing the metallurgy industry in [[Lyudinovo]], [[Kaluga Oblast]]. From this basis Sergei developed the Mal’tsov industrial region an area which covered about 215,000 hectares mostly along the [[Bolva River]]. He turned the industrial region into a major centre of machine building. It was here that the first rails, locomotives, steamships, and screw propellers were  made in Russia. By 1875, Mal’tsov was able to found a corporation which included over 30 enterprises with a combined capital of 6 million rubles. These works were nationalised in 1885.&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;{{cite book|title=Maltsov Family|date=1979|publisher=The Great Soviet Encyclopedia|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Maltsov+Family|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2430">The '''Small Business Health Care tax credit''' is available to [[Small business|small employers]] who pay [[health insurance premium]]s on behalf of employees enrolled in a qualified health plan offered through a [[Small Business Health Options Program]] (SHOP) Marketplace. Employers who purchase health insurance through the program may get a tax credit of up to 50% of their premium contributions. However, to qualify for the tax credit, they must meet certain standards. Firstly, employers have fewer than 25 employees.&lt;ref&gt;http://michronicleonline.com/2014/11/26/how-much-is-your-small-business-health-care-tax-credit-worth/&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, their employee salary must be less than an average of $50,000. Thirdly, employer must pay at least 50% of the full-time employee's premium costs. However, employers are not required to offer coverage to part-time employees (work fewer than 30 works/week) or dependents, or to  seasonal workers  who aren't considered  full-time employees unless they work more than 120 days during the tax year. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/uac/Small-Business-Health-Care-Tax-Credit-Questions-and-Answers:-Determining-FTEs-and-Average-Annual-Wages&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the coverage to those full-employment must be offered through SHOP Marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/small-business-tax-credits/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Employers should apply to receive this tax credit on the annual [[business tax return]]&lt;ref&gt;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paychex-offers-five-tax-tips-203400203.html&lt;/ref&gt; The tax credit is highest in particularly for small companies with fewer than 10 employees, with an average annual salary of $25,000 or less. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/small-business-tax-credits/&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, if there are 10 employees with total wage of $250,000, employer will receive a tax credit amount of $35,000 as they contribute at least $70,000 to their premiums. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/provide-shop-coverage/small-business-tax-credits/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Companies law}}
A '''social purpose corporation''' ('''SPC''') is a type of for-profit entity in some U.S. states that enables corporations to consider social or environmental issues in decision making instead of relying only on profit-maximizing goals. The social purpose corporation structure permits consideration of these issues but does not require it. Social purpose corporations are similar to [[benefit corporation]]s (B&amp;nbsp;Corporations) and [[flexible purpose corporation]]s (FPCs).

== California ==
In California, "[t]he amendment, S.B. 1301, changes existing law (found under Corporations Code Sections 2500–3503)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB1301|title=SB-1301 Corporate Flexibility Act of 2011: Social Purpose Corporations Act.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to emphasize the social-purpose nature of the [[flexible purpose corporation]]s, most notably by changing its name to the "Social Purpose Corporation". With the law change, directors are now required to take company mission into account in decision making. A SPC must state that it has a specific purpose to pursue a public purpose that a traditional nonprofit corporation would normally have pursued. SPCs are for-profit organizations and therefore do not qualify for tax-exempt status as a nonprofit corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a California Social Purpose Corporation? |url=https://www.ftb.ca.gov/Archive/professionals/taxnews/2015/September/All_About_Business.shtml |website=Tax news - All About Business |publisher=[[California Franchise Tax Board]] |accessdate=2 December 2018 |date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Update|FPC conversion to SPC|date=December 2018}}S.B. 1301 takes effect on January 1, 2015. On that date, existing FPCs will automatically continue their existence as SPCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.adlercolvin.com/blog/2014/10/06/goodbye-flexible-purpose-corporation-hello-social-purpose-corporation-governor-brown-signs-s-b-1301/|title=Goodbye Flexible Purpose Corporation, Hello Social Purpose Corporation: Governor Brown Signs S.B. 1301|date=October 6, 2014|work=Adler &amp; Colvin|access-date=July 31, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Florida ==
Florida created both social purpose corporations and benefit corporations in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Matt|title=Professor Cohn writes Florida benefit corporations law|url=https://www.law.ufl.edu/uflaw/spotlight/benefit-in-business|website=UF Law|publisher=University of Florida College of Law|accessdate=August 10, 2016|date=December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between the two is that B corporations must pursue a "general public benefit", which applies to all of the company's activities, while SPCs may pursue a public benefit in limited areas.&lt;ref name="Cohn and Ames 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohn|first1=Stuart|last2=Ames|first2=Stuart|title=Now It's Easier Being Green: Florida’s New Benefit and Social Purpose Corporations|journal=Florida Bar Journal|date=November 2014|volume=88|issue=9|page=38|url=https://www.floridabar.org/DIVCOM/JN/JNJournal01.nsf/d59e2cf27607c0cf85256ad1005ba53f/c655f4f9d7d009b585257d7e004bcb18!OpenDocument|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following example from the ''Florida Bar Journal'' gives a good illustration of this difference between SPCs and benefit corporations:
{{quote|Suppose that a for-profit corporation plans to manufacture and sell an anti-malarial drug and, as part of its business plan, will distribute that drug at low or no cost in African countries. If distribution in Africa is the corporation's sole benefit purpose, the corporation could appropriately be a SP corporation. However, if the corporation is a B corporation, directors and officers would be mandated to consider as well employee programs, environmental concerns, community issues, and similar societal factors, and cannot concentrate on a single benefit program to the detriment of other general benefit concerns.&lt;ref name="Cohn and Ames 2014" /&gt;}}

Shareholders, directors, and persons owning more than 5% equity in a Florida SPC may bring lawsuits against a Florida SPC for failure to pursue or create a public benefit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0600-0699/0607/Sections/0607.511.html|title=Statutes &amp; Constitution Online Sunshine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the corporations, their directors, and their management are shielded from monetary damages in such lawsuits for failing to create a public benefit. Florida SPCs must prepare an annual report on the company's achievements towards its public benefit goals, but unlike Florida B Corporations, these reports do not need to be assessed by a third-party standard.&lt;ref name="Cohn and Ames 2014" /&gt;

== Washington ==
Washington State passed the law for social purpose corporations in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.wa.gov/corps/SocialPurposeCorporation.aspx|title=Social Purpose Corporation |website=Washington Secretary of State|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida became the second state to adopt social purpose corporations in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/2014/05/doing_good_for_profit_gets_a_b.php|title=New Florida Law Allows for "Social Purpose Corporations"|first=Fire|last=Ant|date=May 9, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no official requirements for social purpose corporations to have a positive social or environmental impact, most of the companies which have registered as social purpose corporations in Washington State, the pioneering state for SPCs, have a focus on social or environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spcwa.com/we_are_spc/list-of-spcs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141114053558/http://www.spcwa.com/we_are_spc/list-of-spcs/ |archivedate=November 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5251">'''Spinning''' is a manufacturing process for creating [[polymer]] [[fibers]]. It is a specialized form of [[extrusion]] that uses a [[spinneret (polymers)|spinneret]] to form multiple continuous filaments. There are many types of spinning: wet, dry, dry jet-wet, melt, gel, and electrospinning.&lt;ref name="fs"&gt;{{Citation | title = Manufacturing: Synthetic and Cellulosic Fiber Formation Technology | url = http://www.fibersource.com/f-tutor/techpag.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/19980526024459/http://www.fibersource.com/f-tutor/techpag.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 1998-05-26 | accessdate = 2008-11-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
First, the polymer being spun must be converted into a fluid state. If the polymer is a [[thermoplastic]] then it can be simply melted, otherwise it is dissolved in a solvent or chemically treated to form soluble or thermoplastic derivatives. The molten polymer is then forced through the spinneret, then it cools to a rubbery state, and then a solidified state.&lt;ref name="fs"/&gt; If a polymer solution is used, then the solvent is removed after being forced through the spinneret.

===Wet spinning===
Wet spinning is the oldest of the five processes. This process is used for polymers that need to be dissolved in a solvent to be spun. The spinneret is submerged in a chemical bath that causes the fiber to [[precipitate]], and then solidify, as it emerges. The process gets its name from this "wet" bath. [[Acrylic fiber|Acrylic]], [[rayon]], [[aramid]], [[modacrylic]], and [[spandex]] are produced via this process.&lt;ref name="fs"/&gt;

A variant of wet spinning is '''dry jet-wet spinning''', where the solution is extruded into air and drawn, and then submerged into a liquid bath. This method is used in [[Lyocell]] spinning of dissolved [[cellulose]].

===Dry spinning===
A solution consisting of a fiber-forming material and a solvent is extruded through a spinneret. A stream of hot air impinges on the jets of solution emerging from the spinneret, the solvent evaporates, and solid filaments are left behind.

===Melt spinning===
Melt spinning is used for polymers that can be melted. The polymer solidifies by cooling after being extruded from the spinneret. [[Nylon]], [[olefin]], [[polyester]], [[saran (plastic)|saran]], and [[sulfar]] are produced via this process.&lt;ref name="fs"/&gt;

====Extrusion spinning====
Pellets or granules of the solid polymer are fed into an [[extruder]]. The pellets are compressed, heated and melted by an extrusion screw, then fed to a spinning pump and into the spinneret.

====Direct spinning====
The direct spinning process avoids the stage of solid polymer pellets. The polymer melt is produced from the raw materials, and then from the polymer finisher directly pumped to the spinning mill. Direct spinning is mainly applied during production of polyester fibers and filaments and is dedicated to high production capacity (&gt;100 ton/day).

===Gel spinning===
Gel spinning, also known as dry-wet spinning, is used to obtain high strength or other special properties in the fibers. The polymer is in a "gel" state, only partially liquid, which keeps the polymer chains somewhat bound together. These bonds produce strong inter-chain forces in the fiber, which increase its tensile strength. The polymer chains within the fibers also have a large degree of orientation, which increases strength. The fibers are first air dried, then cooled further in a liquid bath. Some high strength [[polyethylene]] and [[aramid]] fibers are produced via this process.&lt;ref name="fs"/&gt;

===Electrospinning===
Electrospinning uses an electrical charge to draw very fine (typically on the micro or nano scale) [[microfiber|fibre]]s from a liquid - either a polymer solution or a polymer melt. Electrospinning shares characteristics of both [[electrospray]]ing and conventional solution dry spinning&lt;ref name="ziabicki"&gt;Ziabicki, A. ''Fundamentals of fiber formation'', John Wiley and Sons, London, 1976, {{ISBN|0-471-98220-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of fibers. The process does not require the use of coagulation chemistry or high temperatures to produce solid threads from solution. This makes the process particularly suited to the production of fibers using large and complex molecules. [[Melt electrospinning]] is also practiced; this method ensures that no solvent can be carried over into the final product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nagy,Z.K.|author2=Balogh,A.|title=Solvent-free melt electrospinning for preparation of fast dissolving drug delivery system and comparison with solvent-based electrospun and melt extruded systems|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|volume=102|issue=2|pages=508–517|year=2012|doi=10.1002/jps.23374|pmid=23161110|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="review"&gt;Hutmacher DW &amp; Dalton PD (2011) Melt Electrospinning. Chem Asian J, 6, 44-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'' see also the articles on [[Electrospinning]] and [[Melt electrospinning]]''

===Drawing===
{{main|Drawing (manufacturing)}}

Finally, the fibers are drawn to increase strength and orientation. This may be done while the polymer is still solidifying or after it has completely cooled.&lt;ref name="fs"/&gt;

==Career==
===Eternit / Exit from Asbestos, Reflection and Legal Disputes===
In 1972, Stephan Schmidheiny started his business career at [[Eternit]]. In 1976, at the age of 29, he was named CEO of the Swiss Eternit Group. According to his brother [[Thomas Schmidheiny]], their father [[Max Schmidheiny]] decided to divide his industrial empire into two halves: [[asbestos]] for Stephan, [[cement]] for Thomas.&lt;ref name="andeva1"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://andeva.fr/?LE-PROCES-DE-TURIN-en-Dates-et-en#5juillet
|title=Audition of Thomas Schmidheiny, Turin Court, Eternit Trial
|date=July 5, 2010
|publisher=ANDEVA (in French)}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this split of activities, Stephan Schmidheiny inherited Eternit.

According to his official biography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espacioschmidheiny.net/en/|title=Why “The Schmidheiny Story: The Sustainable Truth?”|website=Espacioschmidheiny.net|accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; he ended the company's use of asbestos in 1986. Five years before in 1981, Schmidheiny, then Chairman, announced Eternit’s intention to dispense entirely with its involvement in asbestos production and distribution, far ahead of the 2005 European-wide asbestos ban. Subsequently, Eternit worked to develop and fund research to develop new fiber blends to replace asbestos. In 1984, a majority of Eternit products were manufactured asbestos free.

Since 2009, due to his involvement in his family’s industrial dynasty and despite his efforts to exit from asbestos, Stephan Schmidheiny has been involved in trials in Italy, one for environmental disaster and another for voluntary manslaughter, both connected to the employ of asbestos in the factories of Eternit.&lt;ref name="andeva1"/&gt; In the first trial Stephan Schmidheiny was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment on February 13, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asbestosinthedock.ning.com/forum/topics/baron-de-cartier-and-stephan-schmidheiny-sentenced-to-16-years-pr |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530025810/http://asbestosinthedock.ning.com/forum/topics/baron-de-cartier-and-stephan-schmidheiny-sentenced-to-16-years-pr |archivedate=2012-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, 2013, the judgment given in February was not only confirmed, but also increased to 18 years imprisonment  for [[environmental degradation|environmental damage]] by the [[Turin]] Appeal Court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/13_giugno_03/eternit-appello-processo-torino_a0b04034-cc52-11e2-baa8-7c6869fac9d2.shtml |title=Appello processo Eternit, il magnate svizzero Stephan Schmidheiny condannato a 18 anni |website=Corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, it was ruled that the statute of limitations had passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/nov/20/italian-supreme-court-asbestos-ruling-brazil-eternit-afeva-stephan-schmidheiny|title=Italian supreme court's asbestos ruling could have major implications for Brazil|last=Zuppello|first=Maria|date=20 November 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2014/11/20/ex-eternit-chief-might-face-charges_cdffb67f-a13b-4a84-bf57-d61c3bda72e7.html|title=Ex Eternit chief might face charges: Govt pledges to change statute of limitations|date=20 November 2014|work=ANSA|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Schmidheiny was acquitted of the charges for alleged negligent behavior in Italy. 
In 2015, a second trial called "Eternit Bis" began,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/07/21/edizioni/alessandria/stephan-schmidheiny-processabile-per-leternit-bis-HGcK4aadfoFeEBWCq0h9EK/pagina.html |title=Stephan Schmidheiny è processabile per l’Eternit Bis - La Stampa |website=Lastampa.it |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephan Schmidheiny defended against the accusation of voluntary manslaughter. On November 29, 2016 the allegations raised in Eternit Bis were dismissed by the court in Turin and the case closed. Some legal proceedings regarding negligent homicide are still possible, e.g. in Vercelli, Reggio Emilia, Naples as well as in Turin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://torino.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/11/29/news/processo_eternit-153088564/?ref=search |title=Torino, spezzettato il processo Eternit. Omicidio colposo e non più volontario per l'imprenditore Schmidheiny |work=[[La Repubblica]] |date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmidheiny has emphasized that his involvement with the Eternit group was long before the health risks of asbestos were understood, and long before production was prohibited in Italy; this ban did not happen until 1992. He admitted in an interview in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webpaper.nzz.ch/2014/04/20/wirtschaft/L611E/der-italienische-richter-hat-mich-mit-hitler-verglichen?guest_pass=4de9d823a9:L611E:d4f5f00c74bce434772eb31c1b55ec2c0da1602d |title=NZZ Webpaper – «Der italienische Richter hat mich mit Hitler verglichen» |website=Webpaper.nzz.ch |date=2014-04-20 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the strain from the legal proceedings in Italy had deeply affected him. Later, however, he felt the proceedings had become absurd, especially after an Italian judge compared him to Hitler and his actions comparable with “the final solution”.
Beyond the aforementioned legal proceedings, Stephan Schmidheiny set up funds for victims of asbestos-related diseases in South Africa and Italy, as these countries had no successor company to Eternit, which could bear the financial consequences of asbestos exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianaserafin/2014/11/20/swiss-billionaire-schmidheiny-wins-long-court-battle/#2d32368eaed1 |title=Swiss Billionaire Schmidheiny Wins Asbestos Court Battle |website=Forbes.com |date=2014-11-20 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other engagements===
While Schmidheiny withdrew from asbestos production and Eternit, he invested in new industrial segments, building up a multinational conglomerate of shareholdings by adding enterprises in the areas of forestry, banking, consumer goods, power generation, as well as electronic and optical equipment. He also joined the boards of directors of leading companies such as [[ABB Asea Brown Boveri]], [[Nestlé]], [[Swatch]], and [[UBS AG]].

In 1985 Schmidheiny supported Nicolas Hayek in his bid for the Swiss watch holding company [[Société de Microélectronique et d'Horlogerie]](SMH), which resulted in the rescue of the Swiss watch industry. Later from this valuable alliance, the present day Swatch Group was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swatchgroup.com/group_profile/history/today |title=Swiss watchmaker history – Today – The |publisher=Swatch Group |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, as an anchor shareholder in [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie]] (BBC), Schmidheiny co-organized a merger of BBC with ASEA of Sweden.  This led to the creation of the newly positioned, market leader in its segment, ASEA Brown Boveri, today known as ABB Group.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

In 1987, he took over two-thirds of the capital of Landis + Gyr from the family shareholders, as they could provide no successor for leadership. In doing so,  Schmidheiny was aware that major changes were necessary, as the company was not doing well. Schmidheiny restructured the company. In 1995, the company was taken over by the Swiss company Elektrowatt.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

==Philanthropy==
Philanthropic pursuits have been important to Schmidheiny and since the 1990s, he has devoted his life to these pursuits. Schmidheiny is an advocate and leader in the field of [[sustainable development]]. He served as adviser on sustainability to the United Nations as well as to the OECD.&lt;ref&gt;http://richardsandbrooksplace.org/bjorn-stigson/world-business-council-sustainable-development-reflections-its-evolution&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/933/Water_for_Sustainable_Development.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s he created FUNDES,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fundes |url=http://www.fundes.org/?locale=en |title=Fundes – Latinoamerica |website=Fundes.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization that supports the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in several Latin American countries. According to recent Swiss accounts, Schmidheiny began buying Chilean forest land in 1982, and he now owns over 120,000 hectares in Southern Chile, near [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]], land which the [[Mapuche]] Indians claim has been theirs since time immemorial. The Mapuche charge that some of the land Schmidheiny bought was stolen from them during the [[Pinochet dictatorship]], using that regime's standard techniques of intimidation, torture, and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hqinfo.blogspot.com/2006/02/stephan-schmidheiney-2-asbestos-ghost.html |title=The Generalist: Stephan Schmidheiney 2; The Asbestos Ghost |website=Hqinfo.blogspot.com |date=2006-02-28 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rio Summit 1992===
In 1990 Schmidheiny was appointed chief adviser for business and industry to the secretary general of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), better known as the Rio de Janeiro [[Earth Summit]] of 1992. The conference took place in 1992, with 172 governments participating.

As chief advisor to this conference, Schmidheiny created a forum in which leading businessmen from all parts of the world developed a business perspective on environment and development challenges. This forum later became the [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]] (WBCSD), an organization that today counts the world’s 160 most important companies as its members. Schmidheiny was elected honorary chairman, in recognition of his pioneering role in the phase-out of production of building materials containing asbestos.

Following his involvement in the Rio Summit, Schmidheiny authored the book ''Change of Course: Global Business Prospects for Development and the Environment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidheiny |first=Stephan |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/changing-course |title=Changing Course &amp;#124; The MIT Press |website=Mitpress.mit.edu |date=1992-03-31 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by MIT Press in 1992. His book offers an extensive analysis of how businesses can make sustainable development their focus, his book has been translated into fifteen languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WfWdp_ny0YC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Schmidheiny+Book+Changing+Course+translated+languages&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ub13RTkZl5&amp;sig=Wu-CkWKK54WntjahKuqKQPYyqvo&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj79P2gwfjPAhVCuhQKHRiMB98Q6AEIODAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Schmidheiny%20Book%20Changing%20Course%20translated%20languages&amp;f=false |title=Sustainable Development Drivers: The Role of Leadership in Government |page=37 |website=Books.google.ch |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed to ''Financing Change: The Financial Community, Eco-efficiency, and Sustainable Development'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/financing-change |title=Financing Change &amp;#124; The MIT Press |website=Mitpress.mit.edu |date=1998-03-01 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; also published by MIT Press.

===AVINA Foundation===
In the 1990s Schmidheiny established the [[Fundación Avina|Fundación AVINA]] ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avina.net/avina/en/ |title=Fundación Avina.Home - Fundación Avina |website=Avina.net |date=2015-01-18 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contributes to sustainable development in Latin America by encouraging productive alliances among social and business leaders and today is a leading player in that field.

Schmidheiny’s foundation pioneered a South American microfinance system similar to that of [[Muhammad Yunus]] whose widely praised system benefits the citizens of Bangladesh. Stephan Schmidheiny’s charitable activities in South America have meant a donation of over one billion US dollars to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianaserafin/2012/09/19/swiss-billionaire-stephan-schmidheiny-on-philanthropy/#27de3d975432 |title=Swiss Billionaire Stephan Schmidheiny on Philanthropy |website=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TheRichest |url=http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/most-influential/the-worlds-biggest-givers/ |title=The World's Highest Givers - Billion Dollar Philanthropists |website=TheRichest.com |date=2011-05-21 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the creation of VIVA Trust in 2003, Schmidheiny retired from all of his executive functions, including his positions in GrupoNueva &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gruponueva.cl/es/gobernabilidad/viva-trust.html |title=Grupo Nueva |website=Gruponueva.cl |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and AVINA.

===Other philanthropy===
In 1993, Schmidheiny in memory of his late brother Alexander, who died in 1992, founded the Alexander Schmidheiny Foundation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jackson Pollock Number 11, 1951 |url=http://alexanderschmidheinystiftung.ch/de/ |title=Schmidheiny &amp;#124; Die Website der Alexander Schmidheiny Stiftung |website=Alexanderschmidheinystiftung.ch |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the inheritance from his brother’s estate. This Foundation is active in the St. Gallen Rhine Valley.{{fact|date=January 2017}}

Schmidheiny supports arts and culture through a series of initiatives. He has developed and expanded the art collection of his deceased brother Alexander, the [[Daros Collection]]. The Daros Collection, based in Zurich is a substantial collection of North American and European art from the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daros.ch/ |title=Home - Deutsch |website=Daros.ch |date= |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According the information from Fundacion Marviva, Schmidheiny has played a foundational role in starting this organization that bridges scientific research with public activism for the promotion of marine habitat near and in the Costa Rica Thermal Dome, with an organizational presence in Costa Rica, Panama, and Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marviva.net/es/historia&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Topple rate''' is a name of a ratio of speed at which firms lose their leadership positions. It was believed that it was originally created by Jack Percival following losing his job. The Wall Street Journal article that appeared on September 9, 2007 attributes authorship to [[Patrick Viguerie]], a McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant.

For example, the minicomputer industry began, grew up, got big, profitable, smug, senile and died in 20 years from 1975 to 1995. [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] is a prime exemplar. In this case the topple rate of the minicomputer industry was 20 years.

A high topple rate is especially frequently used as a saying in fields of technological business.

The [[Red Queen's race]] has incredible evolutionary similarities. To maintain a leadership position, an industry must change at the same or faster rate than competing industries.

'''Visual Business Intelligence (VBI)''' is knowledge based on the application of visual data to a business problem or opportunity.

The process of visual [[business intelligence]] starts with the collection of visual data which is analyzed to create unique information. This information becomes knowledge when it is applied to a business problem or opportunity. For example, visual data is collected from a [[Retailing|retail store]] (the number of customers who enter an area of interest, the time they spend there and what direction they traveled). This data is analyzed and becomes information (the answer to a simple question such as how long are people waiting in line?). In turn it becomes knowledge (the application of the data to business such as reducing wait times and decreasing departures by opening additional [[cash register]]s between 11am and 2PM on weekends or when more than five people are waiting in line). The opportunity then exists to move further to forecast and even model physical customer behavior.

“Businesses have only begun to tap the capabilities of visual business intelligence. I see a future where we wonder how anyone operated a business without some level of VBI as part of their day to day business decision making.”
-Martin Renkis Smartvue Corporation

==History==
Development of the W Motors brand took seven years.&lt;ref name=BN.lb/&gt;&lt;ref name=GulfBus/&gt; European auto manufacturers [[Carrozzeria Viotti]], [[Magna Steyr]], [[RUF Automobile]] and [[Studiotorino|StudioTorino]] were involved in W Motors's development.&lt;ref name=BN.lb/&gt;&lt;ref name=IL4/&gt; Initial investment topped US$13&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name=BN.lb/&gt; some of which came from [[FFA Private Bank]] of Lebanon, who became a stakeholder in the company.&lt;ref name=GulfBus/&gt; W Motors founder Ralph Debbas has a master's degree in automotive design.&lt;ref name=GulfBus/&gt;&lt;ref name=WDesign&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merani|first1=Megha|title=Car firm behind the 'star' of Fast and Furious 7 reveals plans for UAE academy|url=http://7days.ae/car-firm-behind-the-star-of-fast-and-furious-7-reveals-plans-for-uae-academy|website=7Days.ae|accessdate=18 September 2015|date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W Motors was founded in Lebanon in July  2012.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;&lt;ref name=VVDebut&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vijayenthiran|first1=Viknesh|title=770-Horsepower Lykan Hypersport Set For 2014 Top Marques Monaco Debut|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1091441_770-horsepower-lykan-hypersport-set-for-2014-top-marques-monaco-debut|work=[[Motor Authority]]|accessdate=17 September 2015|date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lykan_HyperSport.jpg|thumb|left|A Lykan HyperSport photographed at Port Hércule in Monaco]]
W Motors launched its first [[prototype]] model, the [[Lykan HyperSport]], at the [[Qatar Motor Show|Qatar International Motor Show]] in January 2013.&lt;ref name=AB&gt;{{cite web|title=The first Arabian supercar debuts at Dubai Motor Show|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/photos/the-first-arabian-supercar-debuts-at-dubai-motor-show-525394.html|work=[[Arabian Business]]|accessdate=18 September 2015|date=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, the company moved its headquarters to [[Dubai]], in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).&lt;ref name="GulfBus"&gt;{{cite web|title = $1.6m Fenyr Supersport unveiled at Dubai show|url = http://www.arabianbusiness.com/-1-6m-fenyr-supersport-unveiled-at-dubai-show-611959.html|website = ArabianBusiness.com|accessdate = 6 January 2016|date = 12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, [[Universal Studios]] ordered twelve Lykan HyperSport stunt cars to appear in the film ''[[Furious 7]]'',&lt;ref name=GulfBus/&gt; one of which is available for public viewing at [[Car vault|Car Vault]] in Dubai. It is the most expensive car ever featured in the ''[[Fast and the Furious]]'' films,&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Jessica|title=Meet Ralph Debbas, the man behind Vin Diesel's Furious 7 Lykan Hypersport|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-lifestyle/film/meet-ralph-debbas-the-man-behind-vin-diesels-furious-7-lykan-hypersport|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)]]|accessdate=18 September 2015|date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the vehicles seen on screen do not have the carbon fiber chassis, diamond accents or other super-luxury touches that production models of the Lykan HyperSport do. The Lykan HyperSport's first pre-production model debuted at the [[Dubai Motor Show|Dubai International Motor Show]] on 5 October 2013.&lt;ref name=AB/&gt;

Founder Debbas announced in April 2015 that W Motors would be opening an automotive design academy, W Design School, in 2017. Also in April 2015, ''[[Furious 7]]'' debuted, featuring the Lykan HyperSport.&lt;ref name=IL4/&gt;

''[[Project CARS]]'', a motorsport racing simulator video game developed by [[Slightly Mad Studios]] and distributed by [[Bandai Namco Games]], released the Lykan HyperSport as its first downloadable content (DLC) vehicle in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Makuch|first1=Eddie|title=Gorgeous Racing Game Project Cars Getting Free DLC Every Month|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gorgeous-racing-game-project-cars-getting-free-dlc/1100-6426257/|website=[[GameSpot]].com|accessdate=18 September 2015|date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, the Lykan HyperSport has also been included in eleven other video games, including ''[[Driveclub]]'' and ''[[Forza Motorsport 6]]'' in January 2016 as DLC.&lt;ref name=IL4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Forza Motorsport - Polo Red Car Pack|url = http://www.forzamotorsport.net/en-us/news/fm6_january_polo_red_car_pack|website = www.forzamotorsport.net|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the [[Abu Dhabi]] police force purchased a Lykan HyperSport.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web|title=A ride with diamond eyes: The first Arab supercar|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/30/autos/w-motors-first-arab-supercar/|website=[[CNN]].com|accessdate=18 September 2015|date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hard|first1=Andrew|title=Abu Dhabi police enlist 770-horsepower, $3.4 million Lykan Hypersport into patrol duty|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/abu-dhabi-police-adds-lykan-hypersport-pictures-specs-performance/|website=[[DigitalTrends.com]]|accessdate=18 September 2015|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LED]] headlights are made up of a [[titanium]] blade encrusted with [[diamond]]s and the taillights with [[sapphire]]s. A 24-hour [[concierge]] service is also available from [[Quintessentially Group|Quintessentially]].

===Lykan Roadster===
Only three of the forthcoming Lykan Roadsters will be sold out of the 5, as 2 will be used as crash tests at Texas Speedway. 

W Motors released an image of the front of a vehicle similar to the current Lykan through their [[Instagram]] page, with the caption, "Can you tell what is different about this Lykan?" and, later, another from the rear, captioned, "From this angle can you tell what's the difference? Only a few of you got it right on the last post ..." Many fans saw this as possible hint that the project will go ahead. The vehicle appeared to have more carbon fibre body parts; however, W Motors later posted that, "[the difference] is scale...". The photos were of a 1:18 die cast model by Frontiart.

===Fenyr SuperSport===

In 2013, W Motors announced it would manufacture a second line of supercars, that was later unveiled as the $1.85 million [[Fenyr SuperSport]], named after [[Fenrir]], a monstrous wolf in Norse mythology. This supercar, with production limited to 25 units per year, &lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;&lt;ref name=VVSuper&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vijayenthiran|first1=Viknesh|title=First Look At W Motors' Next Model, The Fenyr SuperSport|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1088405_first-look-at-w-motors-next-model-the-lykan-supersport|work=Motor Authority|accessdate=18 September 2015|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 W Motors Lykan HyperSport is Coming to North America |url=https://blog.dupontregistry.com/w-motors/w-motors-lykan-hypersport-is-coming-to-north-america/ |work=DuPont Registry |accessdate=18 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125121411/https://blog.dupontregistry.com/w-motors/w-motors-lykan-hypersport-is-coming-to-north-america/ |archivedate=November 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on high-performance and more discreet luxury details when compared with the ones [[Lykan HyperSport]] is known for.&lt;ref name=VVSuper/&gt; The Fenyr SuperSport concept featured a 4.0L twin-turbocharged Flat-6 with {{convert|900|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} and {{convert|811|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}, with a 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph performance time of 2.7&amp;nbsp;seconds, and a top speed over 249&amp;nbsp;mph,&lt;ref name=VVSuper/&gt;&lt;ref name=VVQuim/&gt; and a curb weight of approximately {{convert|2646|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=GTSuper/&gt; The Fenyr Supersport was unveiled at the 2015 [[Dubai Motor Show|Dubai International Motor Show]].&lt;ref name=GulfBus/&gt; On November 29, 2017, with the opening of the new W Motors boutique in Dubai, the production version of the Fenyr SuperSport was revealed, with many changes from the concept.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/motoring/hypercar-manufacturer-w-motors-opens-its-new-dubai-boutique-in-pictures-1.680193&lt;/ref&gt;

The production version of the Fenyr SuperSport features a 3.8L twin-turbocharged flat-6 engine with {{convert|800|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|723|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}, as much torque as a [[McLaren P1]]. 0 - {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} is still 2.7 seconds, while the top speed is now {{convert|259,338|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.

Normal suicide doors are also featured instead of the unique suicide-swan doors from the Lykan HyperSport. Only 25 units will be produced per year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10530">The '''Wertheins''' are an important family of entrepreneurs in [[Argentina]].

The Werthein family, headed by Leon Werthein, his wife Raquel and five of their children emigrated to Argentina from [[Bessarabia]] in 1904, and settled in rural [[Miguel Riglos]], [[La Pampa Province]].

==Agriculture==
Three of Leon Werthein's sons; Gregorio, Numo and Noel (1911–2002), started a company in 1928 dedicated to manage [[agribusiness]], and have maintained farming interests in Argentina ever since. ''Gregorio, Numo y Noel Werthein SA'' was founded in 1959 and includes extensive [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[fruit]] processing holdings. Its agricultural holdings include over 100,000 hectares (250,000 acres) of land and over 45,000 [[cattle]], distributed in the Provinces of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], La Pampa, [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[San Luis Province|San Luis]]. They produce [[wheat]], [[corn]], [[sunflower]]s, [[soybean]]s, [[cotton]], [[popcorn]], [[candy]], [[sunflower oil]], [[Black turtle bean|black beans]], [[Kidney bean|red beans]], and [[beef]] as well as a Ranch division that specializes in developing high-quality [[genetics]] in the following breeds of cattle: Angus and Hereford (south), Brangus and Braford (North). The fruit area produces [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[peach]]es, [[apricot]]s, [[strawberry|strawberries]] and [[plum]]s in dried form and as a [[fruit juice]] concentrate.

==Banking and services==
Julio Werthein (born April 7, 1918) has been involved in the [[Banking in Argentina|Argentine banking sector]] since 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infobae.com/contenidos/373509-0-0-Julio-Werthein-festejo-sus-90-anos-el-Sheraton ''InfoBae'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banco Mercantil Argentino===
In 1963 ''Julio Werthein'' and his brothers established the ''Banco Mercantil Argentino''. This bank was founded on September 18, 1928 as ''Banco Israelita Argentino SA'', and renamed as ''Banco Mercantil Argentino SA'' on October 4, 1940. In 1998, the Banco Mercantil Argentino, with ''Banco Caja de Ahorro'' (Savings Bank), merged. In 2000, Banco SUDAMERIS Argentina acquired the Banco Caja de Ahorro, and after several subsequent mergers and organizational reforms, the Banco Mercantil is now the new ''[[Banco Patagonia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bancopatagonia.com.ar/institucional/historia.shtml Banco Patagonia]&lt;/ref&gt; though the Werthein family no longer holds shares therein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bancopatagonia.com.ar/relacionconinversores/english/institucional.shtml Banco Patagonia: Relación con inversores {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the ''Fundacion Banco Mercantil Argentino'' was established for the support of music, literature and fine arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnm.me.gov.ar/cgi-bin/wxis.exe/opac/?IsisScript=opac/opac.xis&amp;dbn=BINAM&amp;tb=aut&amp;src=link&amp;query=FUNDACION%20BANCO%20MERCANTIL%20ARGENTINO&amp;cantidad=&amp;formato=&amp;sala=1 BNM]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los W SA===
Numerous holdings of the Wertheins are managed under ''Los W SA'' aegis. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/dar%C3%ADo/werthein Linkedin]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caja de Ahorro y Seguro - Insurances===
The ''Caja de Ahorro y Seguro'' and its subsidiaries is one of the largest insurance companies in Argentina. President: Adrian Werthein (born on January 18, 1952).&lt;ref&gt;[https://people.forbes.com/profile/adrian-werthein/77233 Forbes: People]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telecom Argentina===
The Wertheins acquired 48 percent of ''Sofora Telecomunicaciones SA'' in 2005 for 125 million euros from [[France Telecom]], which in turn holds a 68% stake in ''Nortel Inversora SA'', as well as 55% stake in [[Telecom Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcorreo.eu.org/esp/article.php3?id_article=2069 ''El Correo'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other holdings==
Los W Group is a private holding company that owns and manages a well-diversified portfolio of companies in Argentina, with total revenues of approx. US$4,2 Bn and 21.500 employees.
During the 20th century, the Group has successfully invested in agribusiness, telecommunications, financial services, gas and energy distribution, oil &amp; gas, textile, vineyards and real estate. 
Los W has become a very prestigious and well-known group within the business community as a consequence of its strong local presence, excellent track-record, experience in several industries, and a persistent low profile. 
The Group strongly believes in its successful strategy based on the combination of international first tier institutional investors or a strategic player in partnership with a local prestigious and experienced group (i.e. Leucadia and Generali in Caja de Ahorro y Seguro; Telecom Italia in Telecom Argentina and Standard Bank in Standard Bank Argentina).

==Family Business History==
Leon Werthein emigrated from Russia in 1904 and came to Argentina, following difficult times in that empire, especially for Jewish people. The family settled in the countryside and started out a living from scratch, and fifty years later moved to the city to provide for the education of the children and the growth of the business. It is important to note that the growth of the family lead to two different processes of family separation. The first one was in 1973 and the second one in 1992. The descendants of Noel Werthein plus one cousin constitute what today is the W Group, heirs of the original family business.

'''Wouter Vandenhaute''' (born 16 February 1962) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] Entrepreneur, Television producer and former sports-journalist.  He is currently managing director of the Belgian media holding De Vijver, which includes the TV production company [[Woestijnvis]] and TV channel [[VIER]].
Vandenhaute married VRT sports journalist Catherine Van Eylen.

==Biography==
Wouter Vandenhaute was born in Ghent, the son of Godelieve Kiebooms and Gerard Vandenhaute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.telenet.be/Musketeer/stamboom/532.htm Vandenhaute Family Tree] Telenet.be, 28 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  His grandfather was [[Louis Kiebooms]], who was editor of the [[Gazet van Antwerpen]] for more than 10 years. In the early 1980s Vandenhaute studied [[physical education]] at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]].&lt;ref name="vacature"&gt;[http://www.vacature.com/carriere/solliciteren/cv/Het-cv-van-Wouter-Vandenhaute Wouter Vandenhaute CV] Vacature.com, 28 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, he went as a journalist to work for the weekly magazine [[HUMO]], the newspaper [[De Morgen]] and as a sports editor of the then [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|BRT]]. At BRT he worked with colleagues like [[Mark Uytterhoeven]] and Carl Huybrechts, contributing to the TV program ''Sportweekend''. He also presented the sports news in [[Het Journal]].

In the early 1990s, Vandenhaute presented with Uytterhoeven the comedy talk show ''Het huis van wantrouwen'' [The House of distrust]. Between 1992 and 1995, after ''Het huis van wantrouwen'' had finished Vandenhaute went to pay channel [[Filmnet]] as a football commentator.

===Woestijnvis and De Vijver===
In 1997 Vandenhaute founded together with Jan and Erik Huyse Watté the production [[Woestijnvis]], that initially exclusively made programs for VRT. Thanks to TV personalities such as Uytterhoeven, Rob Vanoudenhoven, Tom Lenaerts and Bart De Pauw, and TV shows like ''Man bijt hond'' [Man bites dog], ''[[The Mole (TV series)|de Mol]]'' and ''[[Alles Kan Beter]]'' [Everything Will Better], Woestijnvis grew into one of the most successful production companies in Flanders. In 2000, ''De Mol'' was awarded the prestigious [[Rose d'Or]] of Montreux. The program was further sold to about 50 countries.

In 2000, then called [[Mediahuis|Vlaamse uitgeversmaatschappij (VUM)]] became a twenty percent shareholder in Woestijnvis. That year the production company brought the Bonanza weekly magazine. The magazine flopped and was closed after only thirty editions. In the field of television programs Vandenhautes production company experienced continued success through the turn of the century with episodes of the quiz program ''De Pappenheimers'' and ''De Slimste Mens ter Wereld'' [The Smartest Person in the World], regularly reached more than one million viewers. Even fiction series like ''Het eiland'' [The Island], ''De Parelvissers'' [The Pearl Fishers] and ''Van vlees en bloed'' [Of flesh and blood] were a success. In 2005 Vandenhaute was nominated for ''Manager of the Year'' by the financial-economic magazine '''Trends'''. The prize eventually went to [[Jan Callewaert]].

In 2010, the exclusivity contract between [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] and Woestijnvis was not renewed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/929/TV-Gids/article/detail/1130949/2010/07/09/Woestijnvis-niet-meer-uitsluitend-bij-de-VRT.dhtml Woestijnvis niet meer uitsluitend bij de VRT] Het Laatste Nieuws, 29 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; That year Vandenhaute was made CEO of ''De Vijver'', the holding company whose properties included Woestijnvis, 49 percent of the Humo magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=DMF14012010_023 Woestijnvis verwerft deel Humo] Het Nieuwsblad, 28 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''De Vijver'' purchased with ''[[Mediahaus|Corelio]]'' and ''Sanoma Media'' TV channels '''VT4''' and '''VIJFtv''' for an amount estimated between 100 and 150 million. After the acquisition VT4 was renamed [[VIER]] [Four] and VIJFtv to [[VIJF]] [Five]. In 2012 with purchase complete, Woestijnvis on air talent and programs were transferred to ''VIER''. In 2014, Sanoma share in ''De Vijver'' was sold to [[Telenet (Belgium)|Telenet]], which became one of the three shareholders of the holding company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trends.knack.be/economie/bedrijven/telenet-wordt-mede-eigenaar-van-vier-en-vijf/article-normal-220107.html Telenet wordt mede-eigenaar van VIER en VIJF] Trends, 28 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; As a term of the deal, the weekly magazine Humo again became wholly owned by Sanoma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humo.be/actua/290656/ding-dong-dienstmededeling-humo-komt-weer-in-handen-van-sanoma Ding-dong-dienstmededeling! Humo komt weer in handen van Sanoma] Humo, 28 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Vandenhaute was made chairman of the board of directors of ''De Vijver'' and therefore quit as CEO of the holding company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://focus.knack.be/entertainment/tv-radio/wouter-vandenhaute-verandert-van-functie-woestijnvis-lonkt-weer-naar-de-vrt/article-normal-620173.html Wouter Vandenhaute verandert van functie] Knack Focus, 28 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zhujiang New Town''' or '''New City''' is an area in [[Guangzhou]], [[Guangdong]], [[China]]. It is bounded by Huangpu Avenue on the north, the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] on the south, Guangzhou Avenue on the west and the South China Expressway on the east. 

Covering an area of 6.44 [[square kilometre|km2]], the area is divided by Xiancun Road ({{zh|c=冼村路}}) into two parts. The larger eastern part contains mainly high-end residential complexes and the Zhujiang Park, which lies at the centre. Such a layout was modelled on the [[Central Park]] in [[New York City|New York]] where the park itself provides a green oasis in the city centre and increases the value of surrounding properties. 

The western portion of Zhujiang New Town was planned as the city's new [[Central business district|CBD]] for the 21st century. Its core area, which the government designated as the city's new axis of development, is a continuous open plaza which extends approximately 1.5km from Huangpu Avenue to the Pearl River. The plaze incorporates underground shopping malls, vehicular tunnels and a [[Zhujiang New Town Automated People Mover System|people mover system]]. Flanked by [[skyscrapers]], at its southern end it hosts four newly built cultural venues of the city: the [[Guangzhou Opera House]], the second Children's Palace, the new [[Guangzhou Library]] and [[Guangdong Museum]]. Immediately to the north of these buildings are the supertall [[Guangzhou Twin Towers|Twin Towers]] and across the river stands the [[Canton Tower]], which is the tallest structure in Guangzhou.

While planning of Zhujiang New Town began as early as in the late 1980s, development had stagnated for more than a decade. To encourage development, the local government relocated some of its departments to the area, including the customs office&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gznews.gov.cn/node_148/node_154/2008/09/01/1220255362970.shtml Blueprint of Zhujiang New Town]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifeofguangzhou.com/node_10/node_37/node_85/2007/10/11/119207561828365.shtml Landmark Plazas to Break Ground in Zhujiang New Town]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsgd.com/pictures/construction/200609140059.htm Guangzhou customs office moved to Zhujiang new town]&lt;/ref&gt; and the taxation bureau. A piece of land measuring about 3 hectares was specifically reserved and sold to the [[Consulate General of the United States, Guangzhou|U.S. Consulate]]. Private companies however, were reluctant to move in due to the poor traffic connection and a lack of other amenities at that time. Eventually in 2003 the government carried out a planning review of the area, in which some major adjustments were made to the original plan including more public facilities and transport infrastructure being added to the original plan. The area finally met its opportunity of rapid development as the city prepared to host the [[2010 Asian Games]]. The adjacent [[Haixinsha Island (Tianhe District)|Haixinsha island]] was chosen as the venue of the [[2010 Asian Games opening ceremony|opening ceremony]], as a result the area attracted large investment from the government and property developers. Today Zhujiang New Town has the largest concentration of luxurious hotels and office buildings in the city.

Zhujiang New Town is served by a dedicated [[Zhujiang New Town Automated People Mover System|people mover system]] and the namesake station of [[Guangzhou Metro]].
