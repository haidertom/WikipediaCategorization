'''Abstract art''' uses a [[visual language]] of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph Arnheim, ''Visual Thinking'', University of California Press, 1969, {{ISBN|0520018710}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western art]] had been, from the [[Renaissance]] up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the [[19th century]] many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in [[technology]], [[science]] and [[philosophy]]. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gooding, ''Abstract Art'', [[Tate Publishing Ltd|Tate Publishing]], London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and non-representational art are loosely related terms. They are similar, but perhaps not of identical meaning.

Abstraction indicates a departure from reality in depiction of [[image]]ry in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is likely to be exceedingly elusive. Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In [[geometric abstraction]], for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. [[Figurative art]] and total abstraction are almost [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]]. But figurative and [[Representation (arts)|representational]] (or [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]]) art often contains partial abstraction.

Both geometric abstraction and [[lyrical abstraction]] are often totally abstract. Among the very numerous [[art movements]] that embody partial abstraction would be for instance [[fauvism]] in which color is conspicuously and deliberately altered vis-a-vis reality, and [[cubism]], which blatantly alters the forms of the real life entities depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://painting.about.com/od/abstractart/a/abstract_art.htm |title=Abstract Art – What Is Abstract Art or Abstract Painting, retrieved January 7, 2009 |publisher=Painting.about.com |date=2011-06-07 |accessdate=2011-06-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075052/http://painting.about.com/od/abstractart/a/abstract_art.htm| archivedate= 7 July 2011 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |title=Themes in American Art – Abstraction, retrieved January 7, 2009 |publisher=Nga.gov |date=2000-07-27 |accessdate=2011-06-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608093226/http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |archivedate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstraction in early art and many cultures ==
{{Main article|Prehistoric art|Eastern art history}}

Much of the art of earlier cultures – signs and marks on pottery, textiles, and inscriptions and paintings on rock – used simple, geometric and linear forms which might have had a symbolic or decorative purpose.&lt;ref&gt;György Kepes, ''Sign, Image and Symbol'', [[Studio Vista]], London, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; It is at this level of visual meaning that abstract art communicates.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Hyatt,"Meeting on the Moor", ''[[Modern Painters]]'', Autumn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; One can enjoy the beauty of [[Chinese calligraphy]] or [[Islamic calligraphy]] without being able to read it.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Leys, 2013.

[[File:Immortal in Splashed Ink.jpg|thumb|left|''Immortal in splashed ink'', Liang Kai, China, 12th century]]
In Chinese painting, abstraction can be traced to the [[Tang dynasty]] painter Wang Mo (王墨), who is credited to have invented the splashed-ink painting style.&lt;ref&gt;Lippit, Y. (2012). "Of Modes and Manners in Japanese Ink Painting: Sesshū's Splashed Ink Landscape of 1495". ''The Art Bulletin'', 94(1), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; While none of his paintings remain, this style is clearly seen in some [[Song Dynasty]] Paintings. The [[Chan Buddhism|Chan buddhist]] painter Liang Kai (梁楷, c. 1140–1210) applied the style to figure painting in his "Immortal in splashed ink"  in which accurate representation is sacrificed to enhance spontaneity linked to the non-rational mind of the enlightened. A late Song painter named Yu Jian, adept to [[Tiantai|Tiantai buddhism]], created a series of splashed ink landscapes that eventually inspired many Japanese zen painters. His paintings show heavily misty mountains in which the shapes of the objects are barely visible and extremely simplified. This type of painting was continued by [[Sesshu Toyo]] in his later years.
[[File:Yujian ink Mercadodemontaña.jpg|thumb|right|''Mountain market, clearing Mist'', Yu Jian, China]]
Another instance of abstraction in Chinese painting is seen in Zhu Derun's [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Zhu_Derun_-_Primordial_Chaos_(painting_only).jpeg ''Cosmic Circle'']. On the left side of this painting is a pine tree in rocky soil, its branches laced with vines that extend in a disorderly manner to the right side of the painting in which a perfect circle (probably made with help of a compass&lt;ref&gt;Watt, J. C. (2010). ''The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty''. Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;) floats in the void. The painting is a reflection of the [[Daoism|Daoist]] metaphysics in which chaos and reality are complementary stages of the regular course of nature.
In Tokugawa Japan some zen monk-painters created [[Enso]], a circle who represents the absolute enlightenment. Usually made in one spontaneous brush stroke, it became the paradigm of the minimalist aesthetic that guided part of the zen painting.

Patronage from the church diminished and private patronage from the public became more capable of providing a livelihood for artists.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich, "The Early Medici as Patrons of Art" in ''[[Norm and Form]]'', pp. 35–57, London, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Balfe, ed. ''Paying the Piper: Causes and Consequences of Art Patronage'', Univ. of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[art movement]]s which contributed to the development of abstract art were [[Romanticism]], [[Impressionism]] and [[Expressionism]]. Artistic independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. An ''objective interest in what is seen'', can be discerned from the paintings of [[John Constable]], [[J M W Turner]], [[Camille Corot]] and from them to the Impressionists who continued the ''[[plein air]]'' painting of the [[Barbizon school]].
[[File:James Abbot McNeill Whistler 012.jpg|thumb|left|[[James McNeill Whistler]], ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket]]'' (1874), [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. A near abstraction, in 1877 Whistler sued the art critic [[John Ruskin]] for libel after the critic condemned this painting. Ruskin accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/rpower/archives/001951.html Whistler versus Ruskin, Princeton edu.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616062046/http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/rpower/archives/001951.html |date=June 16, 2010 }} Retrieved June 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/turnerwhistlermonet/wvr.htm From the Tate], retrieved April 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Early intimations of a new art had been made by [[James McNeill Whistler]] who, in his painting ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The falling Rocket]]'', (1872), placed greater emphasis on visual sensation than the depiction of objects.

[[Expressionism|Expressionist]] painters explored the bold use of paint surface, drawing distortions and exaggerations, and intense color. Expressionists produced emotionally charged paintings that were reactions to and perceptions of contemporary experience; and reactions to [[Impressionism]] and other more conservative directions of late 19th-century painting. The Expressionists drastically changed the emphasis on subject matter in favor of the portrayal of psychological states of being. Although artists like [[Edvard Munch]] and [[James Ensor]] drew influences principally from the work of the [[Post-Impressionists]] they were instrumental to the advent of abstraction in the 20th century.
[[Paul Cézanne]] had begun as an Impressionist but his aim – to make a logical construction of reality based on a view from a single point,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Read, ''A Concise History of Modern Art'', Thames and Hudson&lt;/ref&gt; with modulated color in flat areas – became the basis of a new visual art, later to be developed into [[Cubism]] by [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].

[[File:Yellow Curtain.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Le rideau jaune|The Yellow Curtain]]'', 1915. With his [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] color and drawing Matisse comes very close to pure abstraction.]] Additionally in the late 19th century in Eastern Europe [[mysticism]] and early [[Modernism|modernist]] religious philosophy as expressed by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky|Mme. Blavatsky]] had a profound impact on pioneer [[Geometric abstraction|geometric]] artists like [[Hilma af Klint]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. The mystical teaching of [[Georges Gurdjieff]] and [[P.D. Ouspensky]] also had an important influence on the early formations of the geometric abstract styles of [[Piet Mondrian]] and his colleagues in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Mondrian---mysticism---ldquo-My-long-search-is-over-rdquo--4237 |title=Hilton Kramer, "Mondrian &amp; mysticism: My long search is over", ''New Criterion'', September 1995 |publisher=Newcriterion.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th century ==
{{main article|Western painting|Fauvism|Cubism|}}

[[Post Impressionism]] as practiced by [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] had an enormous impact on [[20th-century art]] and led to the advent of 20th-century abstraction. The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of [[modern art]]. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. With his expressive use of color and his free and imaginative drawing Henri Matisse comes very close to pure abstraction in ''French Window at Collioure'' (1914), ''[[View of Notre-Dame]]'' (1914), and ''[[Le rideau jaune|The Yellow Curtain]]'' from 1915. The raw language of color as developed by the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] directly influenced another pioneer of abstraction, [[Wassily Kandinsky]].

Although [[Cubism]] ultimately depends upon subject matter, it became, along with [[Fauvism]], the art movement that directly opened the door to abstraction in the 20th century. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[Analytic cubism]] was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and others into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter. The collage artists like [[Kurt Schwitters]] and [[Man Ray]] and others taking the clue from [[Cubism]] were instrumental to the development of the movement called [[Dada]].

The Italian poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] published the [[Manifesto of Futurism]] in 1909, which later inspired artists such as [[Carlo Carra]] in ''Painting of Sounds, Noises and Smells'' and [[Umberto Boccioni]] ''Train in Motion'', 1911, to a further stage of abstraction that would, along with [[Cubism]], profoundly influenced art movements throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Tisdall and Angelo Bozzolla, ''Futurism'', Thames and Hudson, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1912 Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], where [[František Kupka]] exhibited the abstract painting ''Amorpha, Fugue en deux couleurs'' (''Fugue in Two Colors'') (1912), the poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] named the work of several artists including [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Section d'or, 1912–1920–1925'', Cécile Debray, Françoise Lucbert, Musées de Châteauroux, Musée Fabre, exhibition catalogue, Éditions Cercle d'art, Paris, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He defined it as, "the art of painting new structures out of elements that have not been borrowed from the visual sphere, but had been created entirely by the artist...it is a pure art."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison and Wood, ''Art in theory, 1900–2000'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2003, p. 189. {{ISBN|978-0631227083}}.[https://books.google.com/books?id=SWu4SB92fHMC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Apollinaire+on+Art books.google.com"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the turn of the century, cultural connections between artists of the major European cities had become extremely active as they strove to create an art form equal to the high aspirations of [[modernism]]. Ideas were able to cross-fertilize by means of artist's books, exhibitions and [[art manifesto|manifestos]] so that many sources were open to experimentation and discussion, and formed a basis for a diversity of modes of abstraction. The following extract from ''The World Backwards'' gives some impression of the inter-connectedness of culture at the time: "[[David Burliuk]]'s knowledge of modern art movements must have been extremely up-to-date, for the second [[Russian avant-garde|Knave of Diamonds exhibition]], held in January 1912 (in Moscow) included not only paintings sent from Munich, but some members of the German [[Die Brücke]] group, while from Paris came work by [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Fernand Léger]], as well as Picasso. During the Spring David Burliuk gave two lectures on cubism and planned a polemical publication, which the Knave of Diamonds was to finance. He went abroad in May and came back determined to rival the almanac ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]]'' which had emerged from the printers while he was in Germany".&lt;ref&gt;Susan P Compton, ''The World Backwards'', British museum Publications, London, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1909 to 1913 many experimental works in the search for this 'pure art' had been created by a number of artists: [[Francis Picabia]] painted ''Caoutchouc'', 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://francispicabia.org/?page_id=80 |title=Francis Picabia, Caoutchouc, 1909, MNAM, Paris |publisher=Francispicabia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Spring'', 1912,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/provenance/provenance_object.php?object_id=80658 |title=Museum of Modern Art, New York, Francis Picabia, ''The Spring'', 1912 |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dances at the Spring''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/provenance/provenance_object.php?object_id=80659 |title=MoMA, New York, Francis Picabia, ''Dances at the Spring'', 1912 |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Procession, Seville'', 1912;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=92380.0&amp;detail=none |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805095626/http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=92380.0&amp;detail=none |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-05 |title=National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC., Francis Picabia, The Procession, Seville, 1912 |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wassily Kandinsky]] painted ''Untitled (First Abstract Watercolor)'', 1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stan Rummel |url=http://faculty.txwes.edu/csmeller/Human-Prospect/ProData09/02WW1CulMatrix/WW1PICs/Kandinsky1866/Kand1910FrstAbstr444.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719021713/http://faculty.txwes.edu/csmeller/Human-Prospect/ProData09/02WW1CulMatrix/WW1PICs/Kandinsky1866/Kand1910FrstAbstr444.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-19 |title=Wassily Kandinsky, ''Untitled'' (First Abstract Watercolor), 1910 |publisher=Faculty.txwes.edu |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2013-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Improvisation 21A'', the ''Impression'' series, and ''Picture with a Circle'' (1911);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/images/content/New_York/press_room/presskits/kandinsky_presskit.pdf |title=The Fiftieth Anniversary of the Guggenheim Museum, Kandinsky Retrospective, Guggenheim Museum, New York, 2009 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718222119/http://www.guggenheim.org/images/content/New_York/press_room/presskits/kandinsky_presskit.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[František Kupka]] had painted the Orphist works, ''Discs of Newton'' (Study for ''Fugue in Two Colors''), 1912&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51038.html |title=Philadelphia Museum of Art, Disks of Newton (Study for "Fugue in Two Colors") 1912 |publisher=Philamuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Amorpha, Fugue en deux couleurs'' (''Fugue in Two Colors''), 1912; [[Robert Delaunay]] painted a series entitled ''Simultaneous Windows'' and ''Formes Circulaires, Soleil n°2'' (1912–13);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ens-futurisme2008/ENS-futurisme2008-10-orphisme.html |title=Musée National d'Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, Robert Delaunay, ''Formes Circulaires, Soleil n°2'' (1912–13) |language=fr |publisher=Centrepompidou.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907020700/http://www.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ens-futurisme2008/ENS-futurisme2008-10-orphisme.html |archivedate=September 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Léopold Survage]] created ''Colored Rhythm'' (Study for the film), 1913;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A5735&amp;page_number=&amp;template_id=6&amp;sort_order=1 |title=Museum of Modern Art, New York, Léopold Survage, Colored Rhythm (Study for the film) 1913 |publisher=Moma.org |date=1914-07-15 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Piet Mondrian]], painted ''Tableau No. 1'' and ''Composition No. 11'', 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmm.nl/collection-search.php?reload=1&amp;characteristic_type=Painting&amp;artist=Piet+Mondriaan+%281872+-+1944%29&amp;van=0&amp;tot=0&amp;submit.x=51&amp;submit.y=5 |title=Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, Netherlands, Piet Mondrian, 1913 |publisher=Kmm.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002185216/http://www.kmm.nl/collection-search.php?reload=1&amp;characteristic_type=Painting&amp;artist=Piet+Mondriaan+%281872+-+1944%29&amp;van=0&amp;tot=0&amp;submit.x=51&amp;submit.y=5 |archivedate=October 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Piet Mondrian]] was evolving his abstract language, of horizontal and vertical lines with rectangles of color, between 1915 and 1919, [[Neo-Plasticism]] was the aesthetic which Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg and other in the group [[De Stijl]] intended to reshape the environment of the future.

== Music ==

As visual art becomes more abstract, it develops some characteristics of music: an art form which uses the abstract elements of sound and divisions of time. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], himself an amateur musician,&lt;ref&gt;Shawn, Allen. 2003. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qgqp5-EqEw8C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= Arnold Schoenberg's Journey]''. Harvard University Press. p. 62. {{ISBN|0674011015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Le Targat, ''Kandinsky'', Twentieth Century masters series, Random House Incorporated, 1987, p. 7, {{ISBN|0847808106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan B. Hirschfeld, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Hilla von Rebay Foundation, ''Watercolors by Kandinsky at the Guggenheim Museum: a selection from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Hilla von Rebay Foundation'', 1991. In 1871 the family moved to Odessa, where the young Kandinsky attended the Gymnasium and learned to play the cello and piano.&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by the possibility of marks and associative color ''resounding in the soul.'' The idea had been put forward by [[Charles Baudelaire]], that all our senses respond to various stimuli but the senses are connected at a deeper aesthetic level.

Closely related to this, is the idea that art has ''The spiritual dimension'' and can transcend 'every-day' experience, reaching a spiritual plane. The [[Theosophical Society]] popularized the ancient wisdom of the sacred books of India and China in the early years of the century. It was in this context that [[Piet Mondrian]], Wassily Kandinsky, [[Hilma af Klint]] and other artists working towards an 'objectless state' became interested in the occult as a way of creating an 'inner' object.
The universal and timeless shapes found in [[geometry]]: the circle, square and triangle become the spatial elements in abstract art; they are, like color, fundamental systems underlying visible reality.

== Russian avant-garde ==

[[File:Black Square.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kazimir Malevich]], ''Black Square'', 1923, [[The Russian Museum]]]]

{{main article|Russian avant-garde|Futurism (art)|}}

Many of the abstract artists in Russia became [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivists]] believing that art was no longer something remote, but life itself. The artist must become a technician, learning to use the tools and materials of modern production. ''Art into life!'' was [[Vladimir Tatlin]]'s slogan, and that of all the future Constructivists. [[Varvara Stepanova]] and Alexandre Exter and others abandoned easel painting and diverted their energies to theatre design and graphic works.
On the other side stood [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Anton Pevsner]] and [[Naum Gabo]]. They argued that art was essentially a spiritual activity; to create the individual's place in the world, not to organize life in a practical, materialistic sense. Many of those who were hostile to the materialist production idea of art left Russia. Anton Pevsner went to France, Gabo went first to Berlin, then to England and finally to America. Kandinsky studied in Moscow then left for the [[Bauhaus]]. By the mid-1920s the revolutionary period (1917 to 1921) when artists had been free to experiment was over; and by the 1930s only [[socialist realism]] was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Camilla Gray, ''The Russian Experiment in Art, 1863–1922'', Thames and Hudson, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Bauhaus ==

The [[Bauhaus]] at Weimar, Germany was founded in 1919 by [[Walter Gropius]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Gropius et al., ''Bauhaus 1919–1928'' Herbert Bayer ed., Museum of Modern Art,publ. Charles T Banford,Boston,1959&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy underlying the teaching program was unity of all the visual and plastic arts from architecture and painting to weaving and stained glass. This philosophy had grown from the ideas of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in England and the [[Deutscher Werkbund]]. Among the teachers were [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Johannes Itten]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Anni Albers]], and [[László Moholy-Nagy]]. In 1925 the school was moved to Dessau and, as the [[Nazi party]] gained control in 1932, The Bauhaus was closed. In 1937 an exhibition of [[degenerate art]], 'Entartete Kunst' contained all types of [[avant-garde]] art disapproved of by the Nazi party. Then the exodus began: not just from the Bauhaus but from Europe in general; to Paris, London and America. Paul Klee went to Switzerland but many of the artists at the Bauhaus went to America.

== Abstraction in Paris and London ==

[[File:DasUndbild.jpg|thumb|[[Kurt Schwitters]], ''Das Undbild'', 1919, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]]

During the 1930s Paris became the host to artists from Russia, Germany, the Netherlands and other European countries affected by the rise of [[totalitarianism]]. [[Sophie Tauber]] and [[Jean Arp]] collaborated on paintings and sculpture using organic/geometric forms. The Polish [[Katarzyna Kobro]] applied mathematically based ideas to sculpture. The many types of abstraction now in close proximity led to attempts by artists to analyse the various conceptual and aesthetic groupings. An exhibition by forty-six members of the [[Cercle et Carré]] group organized by [[Joaquin Torres-Garcia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seuphor|first1=Michel|title=Geometric Abstraccion 1926-1949|date=1972|publisher=Dallas Museum of Fine Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; assisted by [[Michel Seuphor]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Seuphor, ''Abstract Painting''&lt;/ref&gt; contained work by the Neo-Plasticists as well as abstractionists as varied as Kandinsky, Anton Pevsner and [[Kurt Schwitters]]. Criticized by [[Theo van Doesburg]] to be too indefinite a collection he published the journal ''Art Concret'' setting out a manifesto defining an abstract art in which the line, color and surface only, are the concrete reality.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Moszynska, ''Abstract Art'', p. 104, Thames and Hudson, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Abstraction-Création founded in 1931 as a more open group, provided a point of reference for abstract artists, as the political situation worsened in 1935, and artists again regrouped, many in London. The first exhibition of British abstract art was held in England in 1935. The following year the more international ''Abstract and Concrete'' exhibition was organized by [[Nicolete Gray]] including work by [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Ben Nicholson]]. Hepworth, Nicholson and Gabo moved to the [[St. Ives group]] in Cornwall to continue their 'constructivist' work.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Moszynska, ''Abstract Art'', Thames and Hudson, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

== America: mid-century ==
{{main article|Modernism|Late modernism|American Modernism|Surrealism|}}

[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1939-1942 - Composition 10.jpg|thumb|left|The above is a 1939–42 oil on canvas painting by Mondrian titled ''Composition No. 10''. Responding to it, fellow [[De Stijl]] artist [[Theo van Doesburg]] suggested a link between non-representational works of art and ideals of peace and spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Utopian Reality: Reconstructing Culture in Revolutionary Russia and Beyond; Christina Lodder, Maria Kokkori, Maria Mileeva; BRILL, Oct 24, 2013 "Van Doesburg stated that the purpose of art was to imbue man with those positive spiritual qualities that were needed in order to overcome the dominance of the physical and create the conditions for putting an end to wars. In an enthusiastic essay on Wassily Kandinsky he had written about the dialogue between the artist and the viewer, and the role of art as 'the educator of our inner life, the educator of our hearts and minds'. Van Doesburg subsequently adopted the view that the spiritual in man is nurtured specifically by abstract art, which he later described as 'pure thought, which does not signify a concept derived from natural phenomena but which is contained in numbers, measures, relationships, and abstract lines'. In his response to Piet Mondrian's ''Composition 10'', Van Doesburg linked peace and the spiritual to a non-representational work of art, asserting that 'it produces a most spiritual impression…the impression of repose: the repose of the soul'."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the Nazi rise to power in the 1930s many artists fled Europe to the United States. By the early 1940s the main movements in modern art, expressionism, cubism, abstraction, [[surrealism]], and [[dada]] were represented in New York: [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[André Masson]], [[Max Ernst]], [[André Breton]], were just a few of the exiled Europeans who arrived in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Naylor, ''The Bauhaus'', Studio Vista, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The rich cultural influences brought by the European artists were distilled and built upon by local New York painters. The climate of freedom in New York allowed all of these influences to flourish. The art galleries that primarily had focused on European art began to notice the local art community and the work of younger American artists who had begun to mature. Certain artists at this time became distinctly abstract in their mature work. During this period Piet Mondrian's painting ''Composition No. 10'', 1939–1942, characterized by primary colors, white ground and black grid lines clearly defined his radical but classical approach to the rectangle and abstract art in general.
Some artists of the period defied categorization, such as [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] who, while a modernist abstractionist, was a pure maverick in that she painted highly abstract forms while not joining any specific group of the period.

Eventually American artists who were working in a great diversity of styles began to coalesce into cohesive stylistic groups. The best known group of American artists became known as the [[Abstract expressionists]] and the [[New York School (art)|New York School]]. In New York City there was an atmosphere which encouraged discussion and there was new opportunity for learning and growing. Artists and teachers [[John D. Graham]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] became important bridge figures between the newly arrived European Modernists and the younger American artists coming of age. [[Mark Rothko]], born in Russia, began with strongly surrealist imagery which later dissolved into his powerful color compositions of the early 1950s. The [[action painting|expressionistic gesture]] and the act of painting itself, became of primary importance to [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Robert Motherwell]], and [[Franz Kline]]. While during the 1940s [[Arshile Gorky]]'s and [[Willem de Kooning]]'s figurative work evolved into abstraction by the end of the decade. New York City became the center, and artists worldwide gravitated towards it; from other places in America as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Geldzahler]], ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940–1970'', Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later developments ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
{{main article|Abstract expressionism|Color field|Lyrical abstraction|Post-painterly abstraction|Sculpture|Minimal art|}}

[[Digital art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[minimalism]], [[lyrical abstraction]], op art, abstract expressionism, color field painting, [[monochrome painting]], [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]], neo-Dada, [[shaped canvas]] painting, are a few directions relating to abstraction in the second half of the 20th century.

In the United States, ''Art as Object'' as seen in the [[Minimalist]] sculpture of [[Donald Judd]] and the paintings of [[Frank Stella]] are seen today as newer permutations. Other examples include [[Lyrical Abstraction]] and the sensuous use of color seen in the work of painters as diverse as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Patrick Heron]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Joan Mitchell]].

== Causation ==

One socio-historical explanation that has been offered for the growing prevalence of the abstract in modern art – an explanation linked to the name of [[Theodor W. Adorno]] – is that such abstraction is a response to, and a reflection of, the growing abstraction of social relations in [[industrial society]].&lt;ref&gt;David Cunningham, 'Asceticism Against Colour', in ''New Formations'' 55 (2005) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederic Jameson]] similarly sees modernist abstraction as a function of the abstract power of money, equating all things equally as exchange-values.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; The social ''content'' of abstract art is then precisely the abstract nature of social existence – legal formalities, bureaucratic impersonalization, information/power – in the world of [[late modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Analytical psychology#Post-Jungian approaches|Post-Jungians]] by contrast would see the quantum theories with their disintegration of conventional ideas of form and matter as underlying the divorce of the concrete and the abstract in modern art.&lt;ref&gt;Aniela Jaffé, in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) pp. 288–89, 303&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''All the President's Men''''' is a 1974 [[non-fiction]] book by [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Bob Woodward]], two of the journalists who investigated the first [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] break-in and [[Watergate scandal|ensuing scandal]] for ''[[The Washington Post]]''. The book chronicles the [[investigative reporting]] of Woodward and Bernstein from Woodward's initial report on the [[Watergate break-in]] through the resignations of [[H. R. Haldeman]] and [[John Ehrlichman]], and the revelation of the [[Watergate tapes|Nixon tapes]] by [[Alexander Butterfield]] in 1973. It relates the events behind the major stories the duo wrote for the ''Post'', naming some sources who had previously refused to be identified for their initial articles, notably [[Hugh Sloan]]. It also gives detailed accounts of Woodward's secret meetings with his source [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]], whose identity was kept hidden for over 30 years.&lt;ref name="deep"&gt;In 2005, Deep Throat was revealed to be then-[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Associate Director [[W. Mark Felt]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Roberts (journalist)|Gene Roberts]], the former executive editor of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' and former managing editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', has called the work of Woodward and Bernstein "maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time."&lt;ref&gt;Roy J. Harris, Jr., ''Pulitzer's Gold,'' 2007, p. 233, Columbia: University of Missouri Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8262-1768-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[All the President's Men (film)|film adaptation]], produced by [[Robert Redford]], starring Redford and [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Woodward and Bernstein, respectively, was released in 1976.  That same year, a sequel to the book, ''[[The Final Days]]'', was published, which chronicled the last months of [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]'s presidency, starting around the time their previous book ended.

==Background==
Woodward and Bernstein had considered the idea of writing a book about Watergate, but did not commit until actor [[Robert Redford]] expressed interest in purchasing the film rights. In ''Telling the Truth About Lies: The Making of "All the President's Men"'', Woodward noted that Redford played an important role in changing the book's narrative from a story about the Watergate events to one about their investigations and reportage of the story.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0778867/ Telling the Truth about Lies: the Making of 'All the President&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Men']''from [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the book alludes to the [[nursery rhyme]] about [[Humpty Dumpty]] ("All the king's horses and all the king's men / Couldn't put Humpty together again"). An allusion similar to that was made more explicitly a quarter-century earlier in the [[Robert Penn Warren]] novel ''[[All the King's Men]]'', which describes the career of a fictional corrupt governor, loosely based on [[Huey Long]].

The authors received an advance of $55,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/30/business/profits-dick-snyder-s-ugly-word.html|title=Profits - Dick Snyder's Ugly Word|last=Cohen|first=Roger|date=1991-06-30|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir, Michael Korda said of the book's publication that it "transformed book publishing into a red-hot part of media" and books became "news" instead of history.

Because the book was embargoed until publication day, there were no advance copies for reviewers. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] became known as the "[[Watergate scandal|Watergate]]" publisher by following up ''All the President's Men'' with books by [[John Dean]], Maureen Dean, [[John Ehrlichman]] and [[John N.

'''Anti-monumentalism''' (or '''Counter-monumentalism''') is a philosophy in art that denies the presence of any imposing, authoritative social force in public spaces. It developed as an opposition to monumentalism whereby authorities (usually the state or dictator) establish monuments in public spaces to symbolize themselves or their ideology, and influence the historical narrative of the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=counter-monuments |url=http://www2.facinghistory.org/campus/memorials.nsf/0/0E862768014D1FE985256E3E004F50E6 |publisher=Facing History and Ourselves |accessdate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415170228/http://www2.facinghistory.org/campus/memorials.nsf/0/0E862768014D1FE985256E3E004F50E6 |archivedate=15 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to artist [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]],  anti-monument "refers to an action, a performance, which clearly rejects the notion of a monument developed from an elitist point of view as an emblem of power."&lt;ref name="ISBN 90-5662-236-6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lozano-Hemmer|first=Rafael|title=Alien Relationships with Public Space|journal=TransUrbanism|year=2002|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krzysztof Wodiczko]]'s ''Bunker Hill Monument Projections''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leigh Mahan |first=Nicole |title=Krzysztof Wodiczko;s "If You See Something...": counter-memory and the role of the artist in Post-9/11 America |url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04122010-150159/unrestricted/Mahan_N_Thesis_2010s.pdf |accessdate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414231038/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04122010-150159/unrestricted/Mahan_N_Thesis_2010s.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Do-Ho Suh]]'s ''Public Figures'' can be considered examples of anti-monumentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shu|first=Do-Ho|title=The Anti-Monument|url=http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2004.10-detail-korean-artist/|publisher=The Walrus|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Architectural management''' falls into two distinct parts, [[office management]] and [[project management]] (Brunton et al., 1964; Emmitt, 1999a &amp; 1999b). Office management provides an overall framework within which individual projects are commissioned, designed and completed. Both parts have the same objectives but are typically addressed by separate [[management systems]]. Office management involves the allocation and [[Financial management|financing]] of resources, principally premises, trained staff and [[computer systems]], and on establishing and charging appropriate fees for the services rendered. Project management focuses on timescales, developing a [[design]] from initial concept to working drawings, and managing the [[construction]] process (see for example Emmitt, 2014).

The essence of architectural management is to ensure that work on a project is cost-effective, to achieve a balance between profitability and design quality.

== Development ==
Standard management techniques and tools, borrowed mainly from repetitive industrial processes, have not always fitted comfortably with the image of the [[architect]] as a creative individual, rather than a professional member of a business team. The term ‘architectural management’ has been in use since the 1960s as building construction became more complex, because of a shift from standard traditional construction details, to innovation and experimentation. [[Architectural practice]]s generally employ an office manager who may have at their disposal an [[Administrative Assistant|administration assistant]] or team of assistants. Project management is increasingly a role played by an independent consultant, especially during the construction phase. Project managers are typically from one of the [[surveying]] disciplines, leaving only the architectural elements to be managed in-house by the architects.

==Africa==
{{main|Culture of Africa}}

;Art
[[African art]] reflects the diversity of African cultures. The oldest existing art from Africa are 6,000-year-old carvings found in [[Niger]], while the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in [[Egypt]] was the world's tallest architectural accomplishment for 4,000 years until the creation of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. The Ethiopian complex of [[monolithic church]]es at [[Lalibela]], of which the [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela|Church of Saint George]] is representative, is regarded as another marvel of engineering.

;Dance
The term [[African dance]] refers mainly to the dances of subsaharan Africa. The music and dances of northern Africa and the Sahara are generally more closely connected to those of the Near East. Also the dances of immigrants of European and Asian descent (e.g. in South Africa) are not covered by this article.

African dance has to be viewed in close connection with [[African Music]].

A central trait of African dance is that it is polycentric. This means that - unlike many other regions of the world - the body is not treated as a "stiff" unit but is segmented into several centers of movement (shoulders, chest, pelvis, arms, legs etc.) that may be moved according to different rhythmical components of the music or even add rhythmical components of their own. This may result in very complex movements "inside" the body, as opposed to the movement through space of the whole body that plays the most important role in many European choreographies.

;Music
The [[music of Africa]] is one of its most dynamic art forms. Egypt has long been a cultural focus of the Arab world, while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular west Africa, was transmitted through the [[Atlantic slave trade]] to modern [[samba]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], [[rap music|rap]], and [[rock and roll]]. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of [[soukous]], dominated by the [[music of the Democratic Republic of Congo]]. A recent development of the twenty first century is the emergence of [[African hip hop]]. In particular, a form from [[Senegal]] is blended with traditional [[mbalax]]. Recently in South Africa, a form of music related to [[house music]] known under the name [[Kwaito]] has developed, although the country has been home to its own form of [[South African jazz]] for some time, while [[Afrikaans]] music is completely distinct and composed mostly of traditional [[Boere musiek]], and forms of [[Folk music|folk]] and [[Rock and roll|rock]] music.

==Anglo America (United States and Canada)==

===Canada===

{{main|Culture of Canada}}
Canadian culture has historically been heavily influenced by [[English people|English]], [[French people|French]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] cultures and traditions, and over time has been greatly influenced by American culture due to its proximity and the interchange of [[human capital]]. Many forms of American media and entertainment are popular, if not dominant in Canada; conversely, many Canadian cultural products and entertainers are successful in the US and worldwide.  Many cultural products are now marketed toward a unified "North American" market, or a global market generally.

The creation and preservation of more distinctly Canadian culture has been partly influenced by federal government programs, laws and institutions such as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC), the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB), and the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC).

===United States===

{{main|Culture of the United States}}

[[Music of the United States|Music in the United States]] also traces to the country's melting-pot population through a diverse array of styles. [[Rock and roll]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues|blues]], and [[jazz]] are among the country's most internationally renowned [[genre]]s. Since the late 19th century, popular recorded music from the United States has become increasingly known across the world, such that some forms of American [[popular music]] are heard almost everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Provine, Rob with Okon Hwang and Andy Kershaw. "Our Life Is Precisely a Song" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music, Volume 2'', pg. 167. {{ISBN|1-85828-636-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Mickey-06.gif|76px|thumb|Mickey Mouse has become an American icon.]] --&gt;
However, not all American culture is derived from some other form found elsewhere in the world. For example, the birth of [[Cinema of the United States|cinema]], as well as its radical development, can largely be traced back to the United States. In 1878, the first recorded instance of sequential photographs capturing and reproducing motion was [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s series of a [[:Image:The Horse in Motion.jpg|running horse]], which the British-born photographer produced in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], California, using a row of still cameras. Since then, the American film industry, centered in Hollywood, California, has had a profound effect on cinema across the world. Other areas of development include the [[American comic book|comic book]] and [[Disney]]'s [[animated cartoon|animated film]]s, which saw widespread popularity and influence, especially in Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] and [[Chinese animation]] and [[manhua]].

==Asia==
{{main|Culture of Asia}}

[[Image:DragonThrone.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Detail of the [[Dragon Throne]] used by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of China, [[Forbidden City]], [[Qing dynasty]]. Artifact circulating in U.S. museums on loan from Beijing]]

[[Asian art]], [[Asian music|music]], as well as [[literature]], are important parts of Asian culture.  [[Harmonic music]] can follow the [[pentatonic scale]] as well as the [[twelve-tone scale]]; [[percussive music]] can use cymbals as well as gongs, in Asia.

;Architecture
In Japan, the temples of [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] might be over 1,000 years old in style, but are completely rebuilt, in the same style, every few generations or so. The primary reason for this was that the materials might be wood and thatch rather than stone and tile.

Other cultures might build from stone, but the jungles and forests might overgrow the buildings, as in [[Angkor Wat]].

;Literature
[[Japanese literature#Early-modern literature|Early-Modern Japanese literature]] (17th&amp;ndash;19th centuries) developed innovations such as [[haiku]], a form of [[Japanese poetry]] that evolved from the ancient ''[[hokku]]'' ([[Japanese language]]: 発句) mode. Haiku consists of three lines: the first and third lines each have five ''morae'' (the rough [[phonology|phonological]] equivalent of [[syllable]]s), while the second has seven. Original haiku masters included such figures as [[Edo period]] poet [[Matsuo Bashō]] (松尾芭蕉); others influenced by Bashō include [[Kobayashi Issa]] and [[Masaoka Shiki]].

;Dance
In [[Punjab, India]], [[Bhangra (dance)|bhangra]] is popular.

In all countries in [[Southeast Asia]], dance is an integral part of the culture. There are courtly dances, found, for example, wherever there are [[Raja]]hs and [[princess]]es. There are also dances of celebration.  For example, according to oral history, in 1212, when 10 [[Borneo|Bornean]] [[datu]]s left the rule of [[Sri Vijaya]]n empire on [[Borneo]], they sailed away and negotiated [[Antique province#History|settlement right]]s with the chieftain of the [[Negrito]]s on the island of [[Panay]]. In commemoration of the agreement, they danced; the Negritos danced as well.

;Music
{{main|Central Asian music}}

The music of [[Central Asia]] is as vast and unique as the many cultures and peoples who inhabit the region.  The one constant throughout the musical landscape is [[Islam]], which defines the music's focus and the musicians' inspiration.

Principal instrument types are two- or three-stringed [[lute]]s, the necks either fretted or fretless; [[fiddle]]s made of horsehair; [[flute]]s, mostly open at both ends and either end-blown or side-blown; and [[jaw harp]]s, either metal or, often in [[Siberia]], wooden. [[Percussion instrument]]s include frame drums, tambourines, and kettledrums.

Instrumental [[polyphony]] is achieved primarily by lutes and fiddles. On the other hand, vocal polyphony is achieved in different ways: [[Bashkir people|Bashkirs]] hum a basic pitch while playing solo flute.

==Europe==
{{main|Western art}}

Europe has been a cradle for many cultural innovations and movements, often at odds with each other such as [[proselytism|Christian proselytism]] and [[Humanism]], that have consequently been spread across the globe. The [[Renaissance]] of classical ideas influenced the development of art and [[European literature|literature]] far beyond the confines of the continent.

==Latin America==

===Visual art===
{{main|Latin American art}}
Beyond the rich tradition of indigenous art, the development of Latin American visual art owed much to the influence of Spanish, Portuguese and French Baroque painting, which in turn often followed the trends of the Italian Masters. In general, this artistic Eurocentrism began to fade in the early twentieth century, as Latin-Americans began to acknowledge the uniqueness of their condition and started to follow their own path.

An important artistic movement generated in Latin America is ''[[Mural]]ismo'' represented by [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[Rufino Tamayo]] in Mexico and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] and [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] in Colombia. Some impressive ''Muralista'' works can be found also in a number of cities in the USA.

Mexican painter [[Frida Kahlo]] remains by far the most known and famous Latin American artist.. Kahlo's work commands the highest selling price of all Latin American paintings.

===Literature===
{{main|Latin American literature}}
What really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary [[Latin American Boom|boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as [[Julio Cortázar]]'s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cortázar novel)|Rayuela]]'' (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English.  The Boom's defining novel was [[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s [[One Hundred Years of Solitude|Cien años de soledad]] (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with [[magic realism]], though other important writers of the period such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]] do not fit so easily within this framework.  Arguably, the Boom's culmination was [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]'s monumental ''[[Yo, el supremo]]'' (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Alejo Carpentier]], and above all [[Jorge Luis Borges]] were also rediscovered.

Contemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling [[Paulo Coelho]] and [[Isabel Allende]] to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as [[Diamela Eltit]], [[Ricardo Piglia]], or [[Roberto Bolaño]].  There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of [[Testimony#Testimony in literature|testimonio]], texts produced in collaboration with [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] subjects such as [[Rigoberta Menchú]].  Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic [[Carlos Monsiváis]] and [[Pedro Lemebel]].

The region boasts five [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prizewinners]]: in addition to the Colombian García Márquez (1982), also the Chilean poet [[Gabriela Mistral]] (1945), the Guatemalan novelist [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]] (1967), the Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]] (1971), and the Mexican poet and essayist [[Octavio Paz]] (1990).

===Music===
{{main|Latin American music}}

One of the main characteristics of Latin American music is its diversity, from the lively rhythms of Central America and the Caribbean to the more austere sounds of southern South America. Another feature of Latin American music is its original blending of the variety of styles that arrived in The Americas and became influential, from the early Spanish and European Baroque to the different beats of the African rhythms.

Hispano-Caribbean music, such as [[salsa music|salsa]], [[Merengue music|merengue]], [[bachata (music)|bachata]], etc., are styles of music that have been strongly influenced by African rhythms and melodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Washburne |first=Dr. Christopher |publisher=University of Salsa |title=Clave: The African Roots of Salsa |date=Last accessed 05-23-06 |url=http://www.planetsalsa.com/university_of_salsa/clave/clave_roots.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Caravan Music |title=Guide to Latin Music |url=http://www.caravanmusic.com/GuideLatinMusic.htm |date=Last accessed 05-23-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, the main contribution to music entered through folklore, where the true soul of the Latin American and Caribbean countries is expressed. Musicians such as [[Atahualpa Yupanqui]], [[Violeta Parra]], [[Victor Jara]], [[Mercedes Sosa]], [[Jorge Negrete]], [[Caetano Veloso]], and others gave magnificent examples of the heights that this soul can reach.

[[Latin pop]], including many forms of [[Rock (music)|rock]], is popular in Latin America today (see [[Spanish language rock and roll]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=The Baltimore Sun  |publisher=The Michigan Daily |title=Latin music returns to America with wave of new pop starlets |url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1999/sep/09-28-99/arts/arts6.html |date=September 28, 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010320054849/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1999/sep/09-28-99/arts/arts6.html |archivedate=March 20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceania==
{{main|Oceanic art}}
[[Oceania]] is the home of the [[Pasifika Festival]], an annual event which draws artists from throughout the region to celebrate Pacific art and culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/whatson/events/pasifika/default.asp Pasifika Festival] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524045908/http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/whatson/events/pasifika/default.asp |date=May 24, 2008 }}, official website of the New Zealand government&lt;/ref&gt;

;Australia

{{main|Culture of Australia|Australian Aboriginal art|Sport in Australia}}
[[Image:Arthur Streeton - Golden summer, Eaglemont - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|240px|''Golden Summer, Eaglemont'' ([[Eaglemont, Victoria]]) by [[Arthur Streeton]] (1889) is an early example of the rich tradition of Australian [[landscape painting]].]]

The primary basis of Australian culture up until the mid-20th century was [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]], although distinctive Australian features had been evolving from the environment and [[Australian Aborigine|indigenous]] culture. Over the past 50 years, Australian culture has been strongly influenced by American popular culture (particularly television and cinema), large-scale immigration from non-English-speaking countries, and Australia's Asian neighbours.  The vigour and originality of the arts in Australia — films, opera, music, painting, theatre, dance, and crafts — achieve international recognition.

Australia has a long history of visual arts, starting with the [[Cave painting|cave]] and bark paintings of its indigenous peoples. From the time of European settlement, a common theme in [[Art of Australia|Australian art]] has been the Australian landscape, seen in the works of [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Arthur Boyd]] and [[Albert Namatjira]], among others. The traditions of indigenous Australians are largely transmitted orally and are closely tied to ceremony and the telling of the stories of the [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Dreamtime]]. [[Australian Aboriginal music]], dance and [[Australian Aboriginal art|art]] have a palpable influence on contemporary Australian visual and performing arts. Australia has an active tradition of [[music]], [[ballet]] and [[theatre]]; many of its performing arts companies receive public funding through the federal government's [[Australia Council for the Arts|Australia Council]]. There is a [[Orchestra|symphony orchestra]] in each capital city, and a national [[opera]] company, [[Opera Australia]], first made prominent by the renowned diva [[Joan Sutherland|Dame Joan Sutherland]]; [[Music of Australia|Australian music]] includes classical, jazz, and many popular music genres.

[[Australian literature]] has also been influenced by the landscape; the works of writers such as [[Banjo Paterson]] and [[Henry Lawson]] captured the experience of the Australian bush. The character of colonial Australia, as embodied in early literature, resonates with modern Australia and its perceived emphasis on [[egalitarianism]], mateship, and anti-authoritarianism. In 1973, [[Patrick White]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the only Australian to have achieved this; he is recognised as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century. [[Australian English]] is a major variety of the language; its grammar and spelling are largely based on those of British English, overlaid with a rich vernacular of unique lexical items and phrases, some of which have found their way into standard English.

;Papua New Guinea
{{main|Papua New Guinean art}}
Contemporary [[Papua New Guinean art]] is notable for its [[wood carving]], [[drawing]] and [[painting]]. Famous [[visual art]]ists include [[Mathias Kauage]], [[Timothy Akis]] and [[Larry Santana]].

Papua New Guinea is also noted for [[Music of Papua New Guinea|its varied music styles]], from [[sing-sing]] to [[hymn]]s ([[Blasius To Una]]), to [[strings (music)|string]] [[pop music]] ([[Paramana Strangers]]) and [[reggae]] ([[Anslom Nakikus]]). [[Sanguma]]'s music combines traditional and [[Western world|Western]] inspirations, as does [[George Telek]]'s.

Papua New Guinea's first published [[poet]] was [[Allan Natachee]]; the country's first published [[novel]]list was Sir [[Vincent Eri]].

;Solomon Islands
Contemporary music in the [[Solomon Islands]] [[Music of the Solomon Islands|features]] traditional [[Music of Melanesia|Melanesian music]], as well as [[rock (music)|rock]], [[reggae]] and [[Christian music]]. [[Sharzy]] is a leading Solomon Islands musician.

The Solomon Islands are less noted for their visual arts, although painter [[Ake Lianga]] has achieved international renown.

;Fiji
[[Vilsoni Hereniko]] is arguably his country's best-known [[playwright]]. He is also a [[film director]], who wrote and directed Fiji's first ever [[feature film]], ''[[The Land Has Eyes]]'' (''Pear ta ma 'on maf'').

;Polynesia
[[Polynesia]]n countries have produced several internationally famous writers, including [[Samoa]]'s [[Albert Wendt]] and [[Sia Figiel]], and [[Niue]]'s [[John Pule]]. Pule is also an artist, whose artwork includes painting, drawing, [[printmaking]], film-making and [[performance art|performance]].

[[File:BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.png|thumb|Logo of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] 

The '''BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra''' ('''BBC SSO''') is a Scottish broadcasting [[symphony orchestra]] based in [[Glasgow]].  One of five full-time orchestras maintained by the British Broadcasting Corporation ([[BBC]]), it is the oldest full-time professional orchestra in Scotland.  The orchestra is based at City Halls in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=George Hall | title=Look north for acoustic paradise | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/observer/story/0,,1697218,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=29 January 2006 | accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==
The BBC opened its Edinburgh studio in 1930, and decided to form its own full-time Scottish orchestra to complement BBC orchestras already established in London, Manchester and Wales. The BBC Scottish Orchestra was established as Scotland's first full-time orchestra on 1 December 1935 by the BBC's first head of music in Scotland, composer and conductor [[Ian Whyte (conductor)|Ian Whyte]].

In 1938, the orchestra moved into its purpose built home at Studio One, in the newly opened Glasgow Studios, at Broadcasting House in Queen Margaret Drive. The newly formed Scottish Variety Orchestra (which became the [[BBC Scottish Radio Orchestra]] in 1967) occupied Studio Two.

As one of the BBC's many ensembles, the orchestra led a busy though sheltered life, broadcasting live at least five times a week from its studio and only occasionally allowed out. Throughout the war, the orchestra fulfilled 30 hours of broadcasts per week on the BBC Home and World Services. This meant live performances at any time of day or night, often broadcasting live to Latin America at half past one in the morning.

By the end of the war, during which the orchestra had been expanded in numbers, Whyte had brought it to a standard considered good enough for the newly established [[Edinburgh Festival]], at which the orchestra has appeared regularly since 1948.

Through the 1950s and 1960s, live studio broadcasting still dominated the orchestra's schedule, and there was little time in its schedule for public performances. This situation changed after [[Norman Del Mar]]'s advent as Principal Conductor in 1960. He led the BBC Scottish Orchestra's first visit to The Proms in 1962, and through his efforts the orchestra was further expanded, which led to a change of its title to the "BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra" the following year. Del Mar's earliest projects included the UK premiere of [[Stockhausen]]'s ''Gruppen'', performed jointly in Glasgow with the Scottish National Orchestra, and it was his interest in contemporary music that laid the foundation for the BBC SSO's long-standing commitment to new work. The BBC SSO has continued to perform the work of Scottish composers in Scotland and at The Proms, such as the 1990 Premiere of [[James MacMillan]]'s [[The Confession of Isobel Gowdie]].

The last twenty years has seen the gradual emergence of the BBC SSO as a fully fledged 'public' orchestra, with foreign touring, commercial recordings and concerts all over the world consolidating its position as one of the cornerstones of Scottish musical life.  The BBC SSO appears annually in such festivals as the [[BBC Proms]], the [[Edinburgh International Festival]], the [[Cheltenham Festival|Cheltenham]], [[Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival]] and the [[St Magnus Festival]] in Orkney.  At the beginning of January 2006, the BBC SSO moved from Broadcasting House, Glasgow to the fully refurbished City Halls in Glasgow.  

From 2003 to 2009, the orchestra's Chief Conductor was [[Israel]]i-born [[Ilan Volkov]], the youngest-ever chief conductor of any BBC orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Cornwell, "Top conductor to leave Scottish Symphony Orchestra"  ''The Scotsman'', 2007-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2007, the orchestra announced the appointment of Edinburgh born [[Donald Runnicles]] as its Chief Conductor in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Cornwell, "Conductor back after 18 years to lead BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra".

The British [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] presented the BBC SSO with its award for Best Orchestra in 2002, and its then-chief conductor Ilan Volkov with the prize for Best Young Artist in 2004.  In March 2014, the orchestra made its first trip to India, covering the cities of Chennai, Mumbai and New Delhi.

[[File:Charles Brooking - A Dutch Beach Scene with a Man-of-War in the Distance.jpg|thumb|A Dutch Beach Scene with a Man-of-War in the Distance]]
'''Charles Brooking''' (c.1723–59)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/people.cfm/id/2965 Biography of Charles Brooking, National Maritime Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608073009/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/people.cfm/id/2965 |date=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English painter of marine scenes.

==Life==
[[File:East Indiamen in a Gale.jpg|thumb|''East Indiamen in a Gale'', 45 x 48 inches, signed by Charles Brooking, c. 1759. National Maritime Museum.]]
It is highly probable that Brooking’s father was a Charles Brooking (1677–1738) who was recorded as employed by [[Greenwich Hospital (London)]] between 1729 and 1736 as a painter and decorator. Charles Brooking senior had earlier been active in [[Plymouth]] and [[Ireland]]. On 27 November 1732 "Master Charles Brooking" was recorded as an apprentice, one of two taken on by Brooking senior on that date.&lt;ref&gt;Joel (1999), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

An anecdote related by the marine artist [[Dominic Serres]] about Brooking is that he worked for a picture dealer in [[Leicester Square]], [[London]], who exploited him until his “discovery” by [[Taylor White]], the Treasurer of the [[Foundling Hospital]] in London. 
[[File:A Flagship Before the Wind.jpg|thumb|''A Flagship Before the Wind'', 14 x 40 inches (1754)]]
Brooking became much more widely known in 1754, when as a result of his “discovery” he was commissioned by the [[Foundling Hospital]] to paint what is now titled ''A Flagship Before the Wind Under Easy Sail'', following which he was elected a Governor and Guardian of the institution. This painting is a huge sea piece intended to "match" another painting, whereabouts unknown, said to be of a  “Fleet in the Downs”, by [[Peter Monamy]].

It is claimed that [[Dominic Serres]] received some instruction for a short time from Brooking. It has also been suggested that [[Francis Swaine]] was another pupil, but the age difference between the two painters was a mere two years, and there is no visual evidence that Swaine followed Brooking’s manner.

Brooking is said to have died of consumption on 25 March 1759, reportedly leaving his family destitute.

==Work==
Brooking's earliest known works are two pictures, one depicting a moonlit harbour scene and the other a burning ship, which he signed and inscribed with his age, 17, and thus datable to 1740. Since he was described as a "celebrated painter of sea-pieces" in 1752, when he worked for [[John Ellis (naturalist)|John Ellis]] (c.1710–76), he had evidently been producing work for at least 12 years before that date. The mention by Ellis occurs in his ''Natural History of the Corallines'', published in London in 1755. Ellis employed Brooking as a botanical draughtsman. An example of earlier work by Brooking is his painting of an engagement between Commodore Walker and a fleet of French ships which occurred on 23 May 1745, which was engraved and published by Boydell in 1753. This painting is now in the [[Greenwich Maritime Museum]].

Except for paintings such as this, which record specific historical events, Brooking’s early works are not easy to date more precisely, other than stylistically and by theme, and have not yet been closely examined for their chronological development. His first two pictures show some influence of [[Peter Monamy]], but he was already displaying strong signs of a distinctive personal manner. He soon drew away from the native traditions of the marine genre, which included formal ship portraiture, although there are at least two works signed by him, one now in the Maritime Museum at Greenwich, which portray a ship in this convention.  There is also a group of paintings and prints, signed or inscribed "Monamy" and datable to the years circa 1745-1750, but whose style is more consistent with Brooking’s. Some of the identical prints occur with attributions by different print dealers to both painters in separate issues.
 
Brooking’s accuracy and exceptionally careful attention to detail manifest his intimate knowledge of maritime practice and naval architecture, as well as his remarkably close observation of the ocean conditions of wave and wind. Contemporary accounts suggest that he had been “much at sea” and he certainly owned a small yacht. In his early years he was evidently employed in some maritime capacity, possibly in a pilot boat at Gravesend. Some of his presumed later works plainly show the influence of [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]].

The [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[Greenwich]], London holds 23 of his oil paintings, a complete set of 28 engravings after his works, and 4 drawings bequeathed by the U.S. President, J.F.Kennedy. A plaque to Brooking was unveiled by the Lord Mayor of the City of London at Tokenhouse Yard in October, 2008.

'''Clean Tech Law''' contemplates a diverse set of legal and policy issues related to the development and commercialization of [[clean technology]]. These issues range from conventional [[natural resources]] law to cutting-edge [[intellectual property]] issues related to [[synthetic genomics]] and advanced materials.  Clean tech law could also address issues and conflicts surrounding the placement of such technologies (e.g., glare from solar panels).

==History==
The term clean tech, or cleantech, is short for [[clean technology]]. The abbreviated use of the term first appeared on October 10, 1990 in the [[Xinhua General News Service]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110315064606/http://cleantechlawandbusiness.com/cleanbeta/index.php/60/the-etymology-of-cleantech/ CleanBeta, What is CleanTech?]&lt;/ref&gt; Now, clean tech, is generally considered to include multiple advanced technologies in four economic sectors: [[energy]], [[water]], [[Raw material|material]]s, and [[transportation]]. These technologies break down in the following categories:

* Energy Generation
* Energy Storage
* Energy Infrastructure
* Energy Efficiency
* Transportation
* Water &amp; Wastewater
* Air &amp; Environment
* Materials
* Manufacturing/Industrial
* Agriculture
* Recycling &amp; Waste&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011205528/http://cleantechnetwork.com/index.cfm?pageSRC=CleantechDefined Clean Tech Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic issues==
As a discrete legal field, clean tech law is in its infancy and so vaguely defined that it focuses as much on more familiar areas like liability and ownership as it does [[business models]] and corporate strategies. The transactional side of clean tech law revolved around development and commercializing of new technologies in [[renewable energy]], [[pollution]], and other frontiers in the fight against [[climate change]] and protection of natural resources, and the creation of green jobs. In addition, the basic economics are inseparable from substantive social and ethical issues posed by these emerging technologies. The more traditional legal areas of [[clean technology]] law include [[intellectual property]], [[patent law]], licensing, [[litigation]], and federal and state [[legislative]], [[landuse]] and regulatory issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3425">'''Commonwealth Association of Architects''' (CAA), formed in 1965, is an organisation for national and regional institutes representing [[architects]] in [[Commonwealth countries]]. As such, under the [[Commonwealth]] [[Commonwealth Family|family]], the association validates courses in architecture and convenes international boards to educational institutions to assess course components against set criteria. Its current membership list is 34 nations. Sir Robert Matthew [[CBE]] served as the first President from 1965 to 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.comarchitect.org/overview/|title = Overview|website = CAA|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vince Cassar is the present president of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/62997/mepa_chairman_vince_cassar_named_president_of_commonwealth_association_of_architects#.Vy2R5vkrLIU|title = Mepa chairman Vince Cassar named president of Commonwealth Association of Architects|website = MaltaToday.com.mt|access-date = 2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the UK's [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) ceased (after many decades) to recognise CAA accreditation of Commonwealth architecture schools, after the CAA refused to grant 'significant' RIBA representation on its accreditation panels to inspect schools first-hand.

[[File:Color opponent process theory contrast of complementary colors.svg|thumb|Complementary colors in the [[opponent process]] theory]]
'''Complementary colors''' are pairs of [[color]]s which, when combined or [[color mixing|mixed]], cancel each other out (lose [[hue]]) by producing a [[grayscale]] color like [[white]] or [[black]].&lt;ref&gt;''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', 5th Edition, Oxford University Press (2002) "A colour that combined with a given colour makes white or black."&lt;/ref&gt; When placed next to each other, they create the strongest contrast for those particular two colors. Due to this striking color clash, the term '''opposite colors''' is often considered more appropriate than "complementary colors".

Which pairs of colors are considered complementary depends on the color theory one uses:
*Modern color theory uses either the [[RGB color model|RGB]] [[additive color]] model or the [[CMYK color model|CMY]] [[subtractive color]] model, and in these, the complementary pairs are '''[[red]]–[[cyan]]''', '''[[green]]–[[magenta]]''', and '''[[blue]]–[[yellow]]'''.
*In the traditional [[RYB color model]], the complementary color pairs are red–green, yellow–purple, and blue–orange.
*[[Opponent process]] theory suggests that the most contrasting color pairs are red–green, and blue–yellow.

==In different color models==
===Traditional color model===
On the traditional [[color wheel]] developed in the 18th century, used by Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh and other painters, and still used by many [[artist]]s today, the primary colors were considered to be red, yellow, and blue, and the primary–secondary complementary pairs are red–green, blue-orange, and yellow–purple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maloney|first=Tim|title=Get Animated!: Creating Professional Cartoon Animation On Your Home Computer|year=2009|publisher=Random House Digital|isbn=9780823099214|page=PT32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fthWZUOAOVEC&amp;pg=PT32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional representation, a complementary color pair is made up of a primary color (yellow, blue or red) and a secondary color (green, purple or orange). For example, yellow is a [[primary color]], and painters can make purple by mixing of red and blue;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Lee|title=Acrylic Painting With Lee Hammond|year=2006|publisher=North Light Books|isbn=9781600615801|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQuM4LYlB_IC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=paint+violet+mix+red+blue&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Dwi0UaDqIIHoiwLE64DQCA&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=paint%20violet%20mix%20red%20blue&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; so when yellow and purple paint are mixed, all three primary colors are present. Since paints work by absorbing light, having all three primaries together results in a black or gray color (see [[subtractive color]]). In more recent painting manuals, the more precise subtractive primary colors are magenta, cyan and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;for example, see Isabelle Roelofs and Fabien Petillion, La Couleur expliquée aux artistes, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Complementary colors can create some striking optical effects. The shadow of an object appears to contain some of the complementary color of the object. For example, the shadow of a red apple will appear to contain a little blue-green. This effect is often copied by painters who want to create more luminous and realistic shadows. Also, if you stare at a square of color for a long period of time (thirty seconds to a minute), and then look at a white paper or wall, you will briefly see an [[afterimage]] of the square in its complementary color.

Placed side-by-side as tiny dots, in partitive color mixing, complementary colors appear gray.&lt;ref name="briggs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huevaluechroma.com/044.php|title=The Dimensions of Color|author=David Briggs|year=2007|accessdate=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colors produced by light===
The [[RGB color model]], invented in the 19th century and fully developed in the 20th century, uses combinations of red, green, and blue light against a black background to make the colors seen on a [[computer monitor]] or television screen. In the RGB model, the primary colors are red, green, and blue. The complementary primary–secondary combinations are [[red]]–[[cyan]], [[green]]–[[magenta]], and [[blue]]–[[yellow]]. In the RGB color model, the light of two complementary colors, such as red and cyan, combined at full intensity, will make white light, since two complementary colors contain light with the full range of the spectrum. If the light is not fully intense, the resulting light will be gray.

In some other color models, such as the [[HSL and HSV|HSV color space]], the neutral colors (white, greys, and black) lie along a central axis. Complementary colors (as defined in HSV) lie opposite each other on any horizontal cross-section. For example, in the [[CIE 1931 color space]] a color of a "[[dominant wavelength|dominant]]" wavelength can be mixed with an amount of the [[complementary wavelength]] to produce a neutral color (gray or white).

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Color printing===
[[File:SubtractiveColor.svg|In the CMYK color model, the primary colors magenta, cyan, and yellow together make black, and the complementary pairs are magenta–green, yellow–blue, and cyan–red.|thumb|200px]]

Color printing, like painting, also uses subtractive colors, but the complementary colors are different from those used in painting. As a result, the same logic applies as to colors produced by light. Color printing uses the [[CMYK color model]], making colors by overprinting cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink. In printing the most common complementary colors are magenta–green, yellow–blue, and cyan–red. In terms of complementary/opposite colors, this model gives exactly the same result as using the RGB model. Black is added when needed to make the colors darker.

==In theory and art==
===In color theory===
The effect that colors have upon each other had been noted since antiquity. In his essay ''[[On Colors]]'', [[Aristotle]] observed that "when light falls upon another color, then, as a result of this new combination, it takes on another nuance of color."&lt;ref&gt;[[On Colors]] or ''De Coloribus'' (793b) cited in John Gage, ''Couleur et Culture'', pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] had written that purple looked different next to white than it did next to black, and that gold looked more striking against blue than it did against white; the Italian Renaissance architect and writer [[Leon Battista Alberti]] observed that there was harmony (''coniugatio'' in Latin, and ''amicizia'' in Italian) between certain colors, such as red–green and red–blue; and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] observed that the finest harmonies were those between colors exactly opposed (''retto contrario''), but no one had a convincing scientific explanation why that was so until the 18th century.

In 1704, in his treatise on optics, [[Isaac Newton]] devised a circle showing a [[spectrum]] of seven colors. In this work and in an earlier work in 1672, he observed that certain colors around the circle were opposed to each other and provided the greatest contrast; he named red and blue, yellow and violet, and green and "a purple close to scarlet."&lt;ref&gt;John Gage, ''Couleur et culture'', pg. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following decades, scientists refined Newton's color circle, eventually giving it twelve colors: the three primary colors (yellow, blue, and red); three secondary colors (green, purple and orange), made by combining primary colors; and six additional tertiary colors, made by combining the primary and secondary colors.

In 1793, the American-born British scientist [[Benjamin Thompson]], Count Rumford (1753–1814), coined the term complementary colors. While staying at an inn in Florence, he made an experiment with candles and shadows, and discovered that colored light and the shadow cast by the light had perfectly contrasting colors. He wrote, "To every color, without exception, whatever may be its hue or shade, or however it may be compounded, there is another in perfect harmony to it, which is its complement, and may be said to be its companion." He also noted some of the practical benefits of this discovery. "By experiments of this kind, which might easily be made, ladies may choose ribbons for their gowns, or those who furnish rooms may arrange their colors upon principles of the most perfect harmony and of the purest taste. The advantages that painters might derive from a knowledge of these principles of the harmony of colors are too obvious to require illustration."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=udu4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=%22count+rumford%22+experiments+coloured+shadows&amp;q=&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22count%20rumford%22%20experiments%20coloured%20shadows&amp;f=false Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, ''Conjectures respecting the Principle of the Harmony of Colors'', ''The Complete Works of Count Rumford''], Volume 5, pp. 67–68. (Google Books).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, scientists and philosophers across Europe began studying the nature and interaction of colors. The German poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] presented his own theory in 1810, stating that the two primary colors were those in the greatest opposition to each other, yellow and blue, representing light and darkness. He wrote that "Yellow is a light which has been dampened by darkness; blue is a darkness weakened by light."&lt;ref&gt;Goethe (1810), ''Theory of Colors'', paragraph 502.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the opposition of blue and yellow, through a process called "steigerung, or "augementation" a third color, red, was born.{{page needed|date=June 2013}} Goethe also proposed several sets of complementary colors which "demanded" each other. According to Goethe, "yellow 'demands' violet; orange [demands] blue; [[Theory of colours#Colour terminology|purple]] [demands] green; and vice versa".&lt;ref&gt;Goethe, ''Theory of Colours'', trans. Charles Lock Eastlake, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-262-57021-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe's ideas were highly personal and often disagreed with other scientific research, but they were highly popular and influenced some important artists, including [[J.M.W. Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;John Gage, ''Couleur et Culture'', pp. 201–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time that Goethe was publishing his theory, a British physicist, doctor and Egyptologist, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] (1773–1829), showed by experiments that it was not necessary to use all the colors of spectrum to create white light; it could be done by combining the light of just three colors; red, green, and blue. This discovery was the foundation of [[additive color]]s, and of the [[RGB color model]].&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Roelofs and Fabien Petillion, La couleur expliqée aux artistes, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that it was possible to create magenta by combining red and blue light; to create yellow by mixing red and green light; and to create cyan, or blue-green, by mixing green and blue. He also found that it was possible to create virtually any other color by modifying the intensity of these colors. This discovery led to the system used today to create colors on a computer or television display. Young was also the first to propose that the [[retina]] of the eye contained nerve fibers which were sensitive to three different colors. This foreshadowed the modern understanding of [[color vision]], in particular the finding that the eye does indeed have three color receptors which are sensitive to different wavelength ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Young, T.|year= 1802|title= Bakerian Lecture: On the Theory of Light and Colours|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.|volume= 92|pages=12–48| doi= 10.1098/rstl.1802.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time as Young discovered additive colors, another British scientist, [[David Brewster]] (1781–1868), the inventor of the [[kaleidoscope]], proposed a competing theory that the true primary colors were red, yellow, and blue, and that the true complementary pairs were red–green, blue–orange, and yellow–purple. Then a German scientist, [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], (1821–1894), resolved the debate by showing that colors formed by light, additive colors, and those formed by pigments, subtractive colors, did in fact operate by different rules, and had different primary and complementary colors.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Roelofs and Fabien Petillion, ''La couleur expliquée aux artistes'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scientists looked more closely at the use of complementary colors. In 1828, the French chemist [[Eugene Chevreul]], making a study of the manufacture of [[Gobelin]] tapestries to make the colors brighter, demonstrated scientifically that "the arrangement of complementary colors is superior to any other harmony of contrasts." His 1839 book on the subject, ''De la loi du contraste simultané des couleurs et de l'assortiment des objets colorés'', showing how complementary colors can be used in everything from textiles to gardens, was widely read in Germany, France and England, and made complementary colors a popular concept. The use of complementary colors was further publicized by the French art critic [[Charles Blanc]] in his book ''Grammaire des arts et du dessin'' (1867) and later by the American color theorist [[Ogden Rood]] in his book ''Modern Chromatics'' (1879). These books were read with great enthusiasm by contemporary painters, particularly [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]], who put the theories into practice in their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;John Gage, ''Couleur et culture'', pp. 174–75&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:GoetheFarbkreis.jpg|The color wheel designed by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1810) was based on the idea that the primary colors yellow and blue, representing light and darkness, were in opposition to each other.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===In art===
In 1872, [[Claude Monet]] painted ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'', a tiny orange sun and some orange light reflected on the clouds and water in the centre of a hazy blue landscape. This painting, with its striking use of the complementary colors orange and blue, gave its name to the [[impressionist]] movement. Monet was familiar with the science of complementary colors, and used them with enthusiasm. He wrote in 1888, "color makes its impact from contrasts rather than from its inherent qualities....the primary colors seem more brilliant when they are in contrast with their complementary colors."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, Histoire vivante des couleurs, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orange and blue became an important combination for all the impressionist painters. They all had studied the recent books on color theory, and they knew that orange placed next to blue made both colors much brighter. [[Auguste Renoir]] painted boats with stripes of chrome orange paint straight from the tube. [[Paul Cézanne]] used orange made of touches of yellow, red and ochre against a blue background.

[[Vincent van Gogh]] was especially known for using this technique; he created his own oranges with mixtures of yellow, ochre and red, and placed them next to slashes of sienna red and bottle green, and below a sky of turbulent blue and violet. He also put an orange moon and stars in a cobalt blue sky. He wrote to his brother Theo of "searching for oppositions of blue with orange, of red with green, of yellow with purple, searching for broken colors and neutral colors to harmonize the brutality of extremes, trying to make the colors intense, and not a harmony of greys."&lt;ref&gt;Vincent van Gogh, ''Lettres à Theo'', p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing his painting, ''[[The Night Café]]'', to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: "I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens."&lt;ref&gt;Vincent van Gogh, ''Corréspondénce general'', number 533, cited by John Gage, ''Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Afterimages==
When one stares at a single color (red for example) for a sustained period of time (roughly thirty seconds to a minute), then looks at a white surface, an [[afterimage]] of the complementary color (in this case cyan) will appear. This is one of several [[Neural adaptation|aftereffect]]s studied in the [[psychology]] of [[visual perception]] which are generally ascribed to fatigue in specific parts of the visual system.

In the case above the [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s for red light in the [[retina]] are fatigued, lessening their ability to send the information to the brain. When white light is viewed, the red portions of light incident upon the eye are not transmitted as efficiently as the other wavelengths (or colors), and the result is the illusion of viewing the complementary color since the image is now biased by loss of the color, in this case red.&lt;!-- How does this inefficiency in viewing a specific color cause the complementary color to form? --&gt; As the receptors are given time to rest, the illusion vanishes. In the case of looking at the white light, red light is still incident upon the eye (as well as blue and green), however since the receptors for other light colors are also being fatigued, the eye will reach an equilibrium.

==Practical applications==
The use of complementary colors is an important aspect of [[aesthetic]]ally pleasing art and graphic design. This also extends to other fields such as contrasting colors in [[logo]]s and [[retailing|retail display]]. When placed next to each other, complements make each other appear brighter.

Complementary colors also have more practical uses. Because orange and blue are complementary colors, life rafts and life vests are traditionally orange, to provide the highest contrast and visibility when seen from ships or aircraft over the ocean.

Red and cyan glasses are used in the [[Anaglyph 3D]] system to produce 3D images on computer screens.

| align="center" | [[Bartol Kašić]]
| ''Institutionum linguae illyricae libri duo''
| The first complete Croatian grammar describing supradialetal form of [[Ikavian]] [[Štokavian]] with [[Čakavian]] admixture. Published in [[Rome]] in 2 volumes, written in [[Latin language|Latin]]. Served as a basis for later grammarians up to Appendini.

| align="center" | [[Jakov Mikalja]]
| ''Grammatika talianska ukratko illi kratak nauk za naucitti latinski''&lt;br /&gt;''(A short Italian grammar or short instructions on how to master Latin)''
| Loreto – Ancona 1649–1651. An [[Italian language|Italian]] grammar, written in the language which is the ancestor of Croatian (also containing a dictionary). Has some bits and pieces on Croatian too.
|-
| align="center" | 1665
| align="center" | [[Juraj Križanić]]
| ''Gramatíčno iskazánje ob rúskom jezíku''&lt;br /&gt;''(A grammatical outline of the Russian language)''
| MS., [[Tobolsk]], 1665. Published: Moscow 1848, Zagreb 1984.. An attempt to write Pan-Slavic grammar based on the data of all the [[Slavic languages]] which were known to the author. Characteristics of one of the Croatian literary languages (the so-called ''ozaljaski književni krug'', Ozalj literary circle) were marked, that was characterised by the mixture of [[Čakavian]], [[Kajkavian]] and [[Štokavian]] traits, so this grammar can be considered a codification of that literary idiom.

| ''Grammatica Latino-Illyrica''
| Venice 1713&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 1742&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 1782&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Republished: Ljubuški – Zagreb – Sarajevo 2003.

Grammar is generally based on Kašić's, but has introduced several improvements. The distinction is made between the definite and indefinite adjectives, as well as the declension of adjectives and the pronouns and numerals. Della Bella tries to achieve a unified orthography, and provides marks of three types of accents (acute, grave and circumflex), and rules governing their distribution.

[[File:Orpen, William (Sir) (RA) - Dead Germans in a Trench - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|William Orpen, ''Dead Germans in a Trench'', 1918; Imperial War Museum]]

'''''Dead Germans in a Trench''''' is an 1918 oil painting by British artist [[William Orpen]], made during the First World War.  It was inspired by the battlefield of the [[Battle of the Somme]] that Orpen had visited in 1917, and depicts the bodies of two dead German soldiers sinking into the mud at the bottom of a [[trench warfare|trench]].

The painting depicts two dead soldiers, one lies on his back, with an agonised open-mouthed expression on his face and a clenched hand raised.  The other, wearing a helmet, lies face down in the mud.  The skin on the face and arms are painted in a blue-green colour, suggesting putrefaction and decomposition.  In the background are the wooden wattle sides of the trench, supported by wooden planks, with white heaps of chalk spoil beyond, and a deep azure sky above.  The bright colours contrast with the sombre subject matter. It measures {{convert|91.4|x|76.2|cm}}.

It was first exhibited at [[Agnew's Gallery]] on Bond Street in London in May 1918, after the initial decision of the military censor [[Arthur Lee (British Army officer)|Arthur Lee]] to deny permission was overruled. ''The Times'' commented that "Mr Orpen is certainly not a sentimentalist; he seems to paint with cold, serene skill, just as he might paint a bunch of flowers" and "only Germans die in this war".{{cn|date=October 2018}}  Orpen donated the painting to the [[Imperial War Museum]] in 1918.

This painting, depicting the stark reality of war, has been compared to an 1865 photograph of dead soldiers of the [[Confederate States Army]] in a trench with [[cheveaux-de-frise]], at [[Petersburg, Virginia]], during the [[American Civil War]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The '''Fenian Cycle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|n|i|ə|n}}) or {{lang|ga|'''Fiannaíocht'''}} ({{lang-ga|an Fhiannaíocht}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/Fianna%C3%ADocht|title=Fiannaíocht|last=Ó Dónaill|first=Niall|year=1977|work=Foclóir Gaeilge–Béarla|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) or the '''Finn Cycle''', also referred to as the '''Ossianic Cycle''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɒ|ʃ|i|ˈ|æ|n|ɪ|k}} after its narrator [[Oisín]], is a body of prose and verse centring on the exploits of the mythical hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] (Old, Middle, Modern Irish: Find, Finn, Fionn) and his warriors the [[Fianna]]. These stories tell of tests accomplished by Finn and the Fianna. It is one of the four major cycles of [[Irish mythology]] along with the [[Mythological Cycle]], the [[Ulster Cycle]], and the [[Historical Cycle]]. Put in chronological order, the Fenian cycle is the third cycle, between the Ulster and Historical cycles. The cycle also contains stories about other famous Fianna members, including [[Diarmuid Ua Duibhne|Diarmuid]], [[Caílte mac Rónáin|Caílte]], Oisín's son [[Oscar (Irish mythology)|Oscar]], and Fionn's enemy, [[Goll mac Morna]].

==Plot summary==

[[Cormac mac Art]], the [[High King of Ireland|High King]] of Ireland formed the [[Fianna]], a coalition of clans, for the protection of the kingdom. The Fianna was dominated by Clan Bascna, led by [[Cumhal]], and Clan Morna, led by [[Goll mac Morna|Goll]], with [[Liath Luachra]], the treasurer. After the Battle of Knock, Cumhal is killed by the Morna, and Clan Bascna's treasure bag is stolen. Cumhal's wife, [[Muirne]], runs away and has a son, Demna, who is cared for by two warrior women, [[Liath Luachra|Liath]] and the druidess [[Bodhmall]]. Muirne marries the king of [[County Kerry|Kerry]].

===Fionn's rise===
Demna got the name Fionn because of his fair hair, and as soon as he came of age he set off for revenge. He kills Liath Luachra, and retrieves the treasure bag, which he then gives to the survivors of the Battle of Knock. While studying with the poet [[Finn Eces]], Fionn accidentally eats the [[Salmon of Knowledge]], and is admitted to the court of the High King at Tara after passing three strenuous tests. After he was admitted, Fionn became the leader of Clan Bascna.

===Fionn and Aillén===
Every [[Samhain]], the phantom [[Aillén mac Midgna]], or Aillén the Burner, would terrorise Tara, playing music on his harp that left every warrior helpless. Using a magic spear that rendered him immune to the music, Fionn killed the phantom. As a reward, Fionn was made the leader of the Fianna, replacing Goll, who had to swear fealty to him.

===Fionn and Sadhbh===
Fionn was hunting a fawn, but when he caught it, his hounds Bran and Sceolang wouldn't let him kill it, and that night it turned into a beautiful woman, [[Sadhbh]], who had been transformed into a fawn by the druid Fer Doirich. The spell had been broken by the Dun of Allen, Fionn's base, where, as long as she remained within she was protected by the spell. They were married. Some while later, Fionn went out to repulse some invaders and Sadhbh stayed in the Dun. Fer Doirich impersonated Fionn, tempting Sadhbh out of the Dun, whereupon she immediately became a fawn again. Fionn searched for her, but all he found was a boy, whom he named Oisín, who had been raised by a fawn. Oisín became famous as a bard, but Sadhbh was never seen again.

===Fionn and Diarmuid===
One of the most famous stories of the cycle. The High King Cormac mac Airt promises the now aging Fionn his daughter Gráinne as his bride, but Gráinne falls instead for a young hero of the Fianna, [[Diarmuid Ua Duibhne]], and the pair runs away together with Fionn in pursuit. The lovers are aided by Diarmuid's foster-father, the god Aengus. Eventually Fionn makes his peace with the couple. Years later, however, Fionn invites Diarmuid on a boar hunt, and Diarmuid is badly gored by their quarry. Water drunk from Fionn's hands has the power of healing, but when Fionn gathers water he deliberately lets it run through his fingers before he gets back to Diarmuid. His grandson Oscar threatens him if does not bring water for Diarmuid, but when Fionn finally returns it is too late; Diarmuid has died.

===The Battle of Gabhra===
{{main article|Cath Gabhra}}
Between the birth of Oisin and the Battle of Gabhra is the rest of the cycle, which is very long and becomes too complicated for a short summary. Eventually, the High King Cormac dies and his son [[Cairbre Lifechair]] wants to destroy the Fianna because he does not like paying the taxes for protection that the Fianna demanded, so he raises an army with other dissatisfied chiefs and provokes the war by killing Fionn's servant. Goll sides with the king against Clan Bascna at the battle. Some stories say five warriors murdered Fionn at the battle, while others say he died in the battle of the Ford of Brea, killed by Aichlech Mac Dubdrenn. In any case, only twenty warriors survive the battle, including Oisín and Caílte.

'''Fountain of the Centaurs''' is a fountain located on the grounds of the [[Missouri State Capitol]] in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]], north of the Capitol building.  It consists of two separate components, the granite pool containing the bronze centaurs and other figures by [[Adolph Alexander Weinman]] and the ''Signing of the Louisiana Purchase Agreement'', a large high [[bas relief|relief]] by [[Karl Bitter]].  Both were dedicated in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.missouriartscouncil.org/graphics/assets/documents/fbad2996bfb5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the mythical beings in the fountain are labeled as “[[centaurs]]” they are in fact “[[ichthyocentaurs]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=6kCDYByxCSYC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=Fountain+of+the+Centaurs&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=otuRuFF7eO&amp;sig=xCY8kv4pcsHNwPOMkdJpYV2l7b4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kDVJVOPwF-OIigKM9IGgDQ&amp;ved=#v=onepage&amp;q=Fountain%20of%20the%20Centaurs&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the lower portion of their bodies are sea serpents rather than horses.  Each of the centaurs is portrayed in a struggle with some sort of creature of the waters.  They both are surrounded by playful sea urchins who stray water on them.

==Signing of the Treaty==
[[File:Signing_the_Treaty_from_the_Fountain_of_the_Centaurs,_Karl_Bitter,_sc.jpg|thumb|250px|left]]
After being named director of sculpture for the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] of 1904 Bitter contributed several pieces to the array of sculpture at the event.  Since it was all made of [[Staff (building material)|staff]] and thus perusable and “swept into the dust bins of time,” only his relief showing the signing of the Louisiana Purchase by [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]], [[James Monroe]] and “the amiable” [[François Barbé-Marbois]] was saved.  Following the close of the fair Bitter was employed to make “improvements in a score of delicate details” of the work and it was cast in bronze and placed in the [[Jefferson Memorial (St. Louis)|Jefferson Memorial]] in St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;Schevill, Ferdinand, ‘Karl Bitter: A Biography”, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois, 1917 p.43-45&lt;/ref&gt;  Bitter was comfortable with the proposed changes and made them, “without any special thumbscrew to my conscience”&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, James M., “Karl Bitter: Architectural Sculptor  1867-1915”, University of Wisconsin Press, Madison 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  A decade later the Missouri Capitol Decoration Committee received permission from Bitter's widow to make another bronze casting of the work and place it in Jefferson City.&lt;ref&gt;Pickard, John, ‘Report of the Capitol Decoration Commission; 1917*1928”  Capitol Decoration Commission, Jefferson City, Missouri,  1928 p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Louisiana Purchase 150th anniversary 3c 1953 issue.jpg|thumb|250px|U.S. postage stamp (c. 1953) commemorating the [[Louisiana Purchase]]]]

The relief is used on a US Postal stamp commemorating the 150th anniversary of the event.

==Plot==
Wealthy Texas rancher Jordan "Bick" Benedict Jr. travels to [[Maryland]] to buy a horse. There he meets and courts [[socialite]] Leslie Lynnton, who ends a budding relationship with British diplomat Sir David Karfrey and marries Bick after a whirlwind romance. They return to Texas to start their life together on the family ranch, Reata, where Bick's older sister Luz runs the household. Leslie meets Jett Rink, a local handyman, and he becomes infatuated with her. On a ride with Jett, Leslie discovers the local Mexican workers' living conditions are terrible. After tending to one of the Mexican children, Angel Obregon II, she presses Bick to take steps to improve their condition.

When riding Leslie's beloved horse, War Winds, Luz expresses her hostility for Leslie by cruelly digging in her spurs. War Winds bucks her off, killing her. She leaves Jett a small piece of land on the Benedict ranch. Bick, who despises Jett, tries to buy back the land, but Jett refuses to sell. Jett makes the land his home and names it Little Reata. Over the next ten years, Leslie and Bick have twins, Jordan III ("Jordy") and Judy, and later have a daughter, Luz II.

After discovering oil within a footprint left by Leslie, Jett begins digging and strikes oil on his land. He then drives to the Benedict house, covered in crude, to proclaim to the Benedicts that he will be richer than them. Jett makes a pass at Leslie, and this leads to a brief fistfight with Bick before he drives off. Jett's oil drilling company prospers over the years, and he tries to persuade Bick to let him drill for oil on Reata. Bick is determined to preserve his family legacy, however, and refuses.

Meanwhile, tensions arise regarding the now-grown children. Bick insists that Jordy succeed him and run the ranch, but Jordy wants to become a doctor. Leslie wants Judy to attend [[finishing school]] in Switzerland, but Judy wants to study [[animal husbandry]] at [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]]. Both children succeed in pursuing their own vocations, each asking one parent to convince the other to let them have their way.

At the family Christmas party, Bick tries to interest Judy's new husband, Bob Dace, in working on the ranch after he returns from the [[World War II|recently declared war]], but Dace refuses. Jett arrives and persuades Bick to allow oil production on his land. Realizing that his children will not take over the ranch when he retires, Bick agrees. Luz II, now in her teens, starts flirting with Jett. Once oil production starts on the ranch, the Benedict family becomes even wealthier and more powerful. Meanwhile, the now-grown Angel is killed in the war, and his body is sent home for burial.

The Benedict–Rink rivalry comes to a head when the Benedicts discover that Luz II and the much older Jett have been dating. At a huge party given by Jett in his own honor at his hotel in Austin, he orders his staff not to serve Jordy's Mexican wife, Juana. Enraged, Jordy tries to start a fight with Jett, who beats him and has him thrown out. Fed up, Bick challenges Jett to a fight. Drunk and almost incoherent, Jett leads the way to a wine storage room. Seeing that Jett is in no state to defend himself, Bick lowers his fists, and instead topples Jett's wine cellar shelves. The Benedict family leaves the party. Jett staggers into the banquet hall, takes his seat of honor, and passes out on the table. Later, Luz II sees Jett drunkenly bemoaning his unrequited love for Leslie. Luz II leaves, heartbroken, as Jett falls over onto the floor.

The next day, on their way home, the Benedicts stop at a diner with a sign at the counter saying, "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone," which during the mid-twentieth century in the southern United States was often taken as meaning that ethnic minorities were not welcome. The racist owner, Sarge, insults Juana and her and Jordy's son Jordan IV. When the owner goes on to eject a Mexican family from the diner, Bick tells Sarge to leave them alone. Bick fights Sarge, who beats him, but then takes down the sign and tosses it on top of Bick. Back at the ranch, Bick laments that he has failed to preserve the Benedict family legacy. Leslie replies that, after the fight in the diner, he was her hero for the first time, and that she considers their own family legacy a success. They look at their two grandchildren, one white and one Hispanic.

==Production==
===Writing===
Ferber's character of Jordan Benedict II and her description of the Reata Ranch were based on [[King Ranch|Robert "Bob" J. Kleberg Jr. (1896–1974) and the King Ranch]] in [[Kingsville, Texas]]. Like the over half-million-acre Reata, King Ranch comprises 825,000 acres (3,340&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; 1,289&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) and includes portions of six Texas counties, including most of [[Kleberg County]] and much of [[Kenedy County]], and was largely a livestock ranch before the discovery of oil. The fictional character Jett Rink was inspired partly by the extraordinary rags-to-riches life story of the wildcatter oil tycoon [[Glenn Herbert McCarthy]] (1907–1988). Author Edna Ferber met McCarthy when she was a guest at his [[Houston]], [[Texas]], [[Shamrock Hotel]] (known as the Shamrock Hilton after 1955), the fictional Emperador Hotel in both the book and the film.

===Casting===
The Australian actor [[Rod Taylor]] was cast in one of his earliest Hollywood roles after being seen in an episode of ''[[Studio 57]]'', "The Black Sheep's Daughter".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Vagg, ''Rod Taylor: An Australian in Hollywood'', Bear Manor Media, 2010 p49&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevens gave Hudson a choice between [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Grace Kelly]] to play his leading lady, Leslie. Hudson chose Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giant: Summary and Notes|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=53655|work=Catalog of Feature Films|publisher=American Film Institute|accessdate=20 August 2012|quote=According to modern and contemporary sources, Grace Kelly was sought for the role of Leslie Benedict. Modern sources claim that once her engagement to Prince Rainier of Monaco was announced, however, M-G-M decided not to loan her out for Giant. Elizabeth Taylor, who ultimately received the highly desirable role, was also under to M-G-M, which loaned her out to Warner Bros. Modern sources also claim that Hudson, when given the choice of his leading lady by Stevens, chose Taylor.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[James Dean]]'s death late in production, [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]] overdubbed some of Dean's lines, which were nearly inaudible, as Rink's voice.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; George Stevens had a reputation as a meticulous film editor, and the film spent an entire year in the editing room.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===

The film begins with Jordan "Bick" Benedict, played by Hudson, arriving at [[Ardmore, Maryland]], to purchase a stallion from the Lynnton family. The first part of the picture was actually shot in [[Albemarle County]], [[Virginia]], and used the [[Keswick, Virginia]], railroad station as the Ardmore railway depot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maurer|first=David|title=Giant effort to make it in movies|url=http://www2.dailyprogress.com/lifestyles/cdp-lifestyles/2008/may/11/giant_effort_to_make_it_in_movies-ar-79181/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121123030/http://www2.dailyprogress.com/lifestyles/cdp-lifestyles/2008/may/11/giant_effort_to_make_it_in_movies-ar-79181/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 January 2013|publisher=Daily Progress|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Much of the subsequent film, depicting "Reata", the Benedict ranch, was shot in and around the town of [[Marfa, Texas]], and the remote, dry plains found nearby, with interiors filmed at the Warner Brothers studios in [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name="Moss2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marilyn Ann Moss|title=Giant: George Stevens, a Life on Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPEhCJbul9QC&amp;pg=PA217|date=4 August 2015|publisher=Terrace Books, University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-20433-4|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Jett Rink Day" parade and airport festivities were filmed at the [[Bob Hope Airport|Burbank Airport]].

===Music===
During the restaurant fight scene at the film's end, the jukebox plays ''[[The Yellow Rose of Texas (song)|The Yellow Rose of Texas]]'' by [[Mitch Miller]]. That version of the song happened to be the #1 pop single on the ''Billboard Magazine'' Best Sellers chart at the time of James Dean's death.

===Themes===
The movie is an epic portrayal of a powerful Texas ranching family challenged by changing times and the coming of big oil.&lt;ref name=McMurtry&gt;{{cite news|last=McMurtry|first=Larry|title=Men Swaggered, Women Warred, Oil Flowed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/29/movies/men-swaggered-women-warred-oil-flowed.html|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 29, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major subplot concerns the [[racism]] of many Anglo-European Americans in Texas during the mid twentieth century and the discriminatory social [[Racial segregation|segregation]] enforced against [[Mexican American]]s.&lt;ref name="Stacy2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee Stacy|title=Mexico and the United States during that time in history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSzyMGh8pNwC&amp;pg=PA326|date=1 October 2002|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7402-9|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first third of the film, Bick and Luz treat the Mexicans who work on their ranch condescendingly, which upsets the more socially-conscious Leslie. Bick eventually comes to realize his moral shortcomings&amp;nbsp;–  in a climactic scene at a roadside diner he loses a fistfight to the racist owner, but earns Leslie's respect for defending the [[human rights]] of his brown-skinned daughter-in-law and grandson. Another subplot involves Leslie's own striving for women's equal rights as she defies the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] social order, asserting herself and expressing her own opinions when the men talk. She protests being expected to suppress her beliefs in deference to Bick's; this conflict leads to their temporary separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giant: Summary and Notes|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=53655|work=Catalog of Feature Films|publisher=American Film Institute|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Giant'' is [[Edna Ferber]]'s third novel dealing with racism; the first was ''[[Show Boat (novel)|Show Boat]]'' (1926), which was adapted into the legendary Broadway musical ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927); her second was ''[[Cimarron (novel)|Cimarron]]'' (1929), which was adapted to film twice, in [[Cimarron (1931 film)|1931]] and [[Cimarron (1960 film)|1960]].&lt;ref name="McGraw2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliza McGraw|title=Edna Ferber's America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut2dAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|date=7 January 2014|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=978-0-8071-5189-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Giant'' premiered in New York City on October 10, 1956,&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=George|title=James Dean|year=2011|publisher=Palazzo|location=Bath, 1956. U.K.|isbn=978-095-649-427-6|pages=227, 233|edition=paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the local [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] station, [[WNYW|WABD]], televising the arrival of cast and crew, as well as other celebrities and studio chief [[Jack L. Warner]]{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}.  The picture was released to nationwide distribution on November 24, 1956.&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;

[[Capitol Records]], which had issued some of [[Dimitri Tiomkin]]'s music from the soundtrack (with the composer conducting the Warner Brothers studio orchestra) on an LP, later digitally remastered the tracks and issued them on CD, including two tracks conducted by [[Ray Heindorf]]. Both versions used a [[monaural]] blend of the multi-channel soundtrack recording.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Reception==
''Giant'' won praise from both critics and the public, and according to the Texan author, [[Larry McMurtry]], was especially popular with Texans, even though it was sharply critical of Texan society.&lt;ref name=McMurtry /&gt; [[Bosley Crowther]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote that "[[George Stevens]] takes three hours and seventeen minutes to put his story across. That's a heap of time to go on about Texas, but Mr. Stevens has made a heap of film." He continued to write that "''Giant'', for all its complexity, is a strong contender for the year's top-film award."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B07E2D61F38E13BBC4952DFB667838D649EDE | title= Movie Review: ''Giant'' (1956).

[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']]'s "Hift" claimed that ''Giant'' was "for the most part, an excellent film which registers strongly on all levels, whether it's in its breathtaking panoramic shots of the dusty Texas plains; the personal, dramatic impact of the story itself, or the resounding message it has to impart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/1956/film/reviews/giant-2-1200418151/ |title=''Giant'' (Review) |last="Hift" |date=October 10, 1956 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[TV Guide]]'' gave the film four stars out of five, saying of James Dean's performance "This was the last role in Dean's all-too-brief career&amp;nbsp;– he was dead when the film was released – and his presence ran away with the film. He performs his role in the overwrought method manner of the era, and the rest of the cast seems to be split between awe of his talent and disgust over his indulgence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/giant/review/124399|title=''Giant'' (1956)| work = [[TV Guide]] | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received a 95% approval rating on the [[review aggregator]] site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/giant/ | title=Giant (1956) | publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less praising was director and critic [[François Truffaut|Francois Truffaut]], who in an early review called ''Giant'' a ”silly, solemn, sly, parternalistic, demagogic movie without any boldness, rich in all sorts of concessions, pettiness, and contemptible actions.”[https://books.google.se/books?id=XP4Ugr7Bv8UC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q=reviews%20by%20truffaut]

===Box office===
The movie earned $12 million in rentals in North America during its initial release.&lt;ref&gt;"All Time Domestic Champs", ''Variety'', 6 January 1960 p.&amp;nbsp;34&lt;/ref&gt;  It was one of the biggest hits of the year in France, with admissions of 3,723,209.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficestory.com/france-1957-c22750201 |title=Box Office France 1957 |last=Soyer|first=Renaud |work=Box Office Story|date=November 9, 2014|accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the ingredients used in the meal tended to be rare for the region, which could also be impacted by the local state and religious customs. The term and its associated practices are usually used positively to describe people of refined taste and passion. Gourmet food tends to be served in smaller, more expensive, portions. There also tends to be cross-cultural interactions when it comes to Gourmet, introducing new ingredient, materials, and practices.

==Origin of term==
The word ''gourmet'' is from the [[French language|French]] term for a wine broker or ''[[taste-vin]]'' employed by a wine dealer.&lt;ref&gt;Cotgrave's French-English dictionary of 1611, quoted by Jean-Louis Flandrin, whose chapter "Distinction Through Taste", in ''A History of Private Life: Passions of the Renaissance'' (Belknap Press, Harvard University) 1989:289-92, "Gluttons and Epicures", traces the significance of these French terms in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Friand'' was formerly the reputable name for a connoisseur of delicious things that were not eaten primarily for nourishment: "A good gourmet", wrote the conservative eighteenth-century ''[[Dictionnaire de Trévoux]]'', employing this original sense, "must have ''le goût friand''", or a refined palate. The pleasure is also visual: "J'aime un [[Ragout|ragoût]], et je suis friand", [[Giacomo Casanova]] declared, "mais s'il n'a pas bonne mine, il me semble mauvais".&lt;ref&gt;"I love a ragout, and I am a connoisseur, but if it isn't good-looking, it seems bad to me." (''Histoire de ma vie'', 8:ix) for Casanova the immediate question was whether a young woman of literary tastes would have been interesting if she had not been lovely.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the eighteenth century, ''gourmet'' and ''gourmand'' carried  disreputable connotations of [[gluttony]], which only ''gourmand'' has retained. ''Gourmet'' was rendered respectable by [[Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La Reynière|Monsieur Grimod de la Reynière]], whose ''Almanach des Gourmands'', essentially the first [[restaurant guide]], appeared in Paris from 1803 to 1812.  
Previously, even the liberal ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' offered a moralising tone in its entry ''Gourmandise'', defined as "refined and uncontrolled love of good food", employing reproving illustrations that contrasted the frugal ancient [[Sparta]]ns and [[Roman Republic|Romans of the Republic]] with the decadent luxury of [[Sybaris]]. The [[Jesuits]]' ''Dictionnaire de Trévoux'' took the ''Encyclopédistes'' to task, reminding its readers that ''gourmandise'' was one of the [[Seven Deadly Sins]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}[[File:Single Malt Scotch Whiskies.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Single malt Scotch|Single malt scotch whiskies]]]]

== Associated terms ==
The term ''gourmet'' can refer to a person with refined or discriminating taste who is knowledgeable in the craft and art of food and [[food preparation]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/26/features/author.php|title=In Arizona back country, a gourmet life|author=Charles McGrath|date=January 26, 2007|publisher=International Herald Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Gourmand]]'' carries additional connotations of one who enjoys food in great quantities&lt;ref&gt;Brein, M.; Keller, T. (2013). ''Travel Tales of Michael Brein: My Best 100:''. The Travel Psychologist Travel Tales Series. Michael Brein Incorporated. p. 207. {{ISBN|978-1-886590-27-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

An ''epicure'' is similar to a gourmet, but the word may sometimes carry overtones of excessive refinement. 

A ''gourmet chef'' is a [[chef]] of particularly high caliber of cooking talent and skill

== Regional differences ==
What is considered gourmet is different depending on the time and geographic region. What is gourmet historically depended upon what ingredients the people of that region had access to and how easily they acquire them. For instance, seafood could be considered a luxury in an area that lacks fish, whereas it would not be seen as such in an area near the ocean or a great river. Gourmet tended, and still does in many parts of the world, to be revered by a person with access to wealth because gourmet food has always been expensive. The expense was the result of a scarcity of ingredients for a particular food in the region at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Economic Way of Thinking (13th ed.).|last=Heyne, Paul; Boettke,|first=Peter J.; Prychitko, David L.:;|publisher=Pearson.|year=2014|isbn=978-0-13-299129-2|location=London|pages=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This fact meant they needed to be brought in from far away, which brought a variety of risks to the merchants. Merchants would have to deal with weather conditions, thieves, and broken equipment, intermediaries, and other such factors that could delay or interrupt the shipment of the good at the cost of their lives and fortune&lt;ref&gt;Diego Puga, Daniel Trefler; International Trade and Institutional Change: Medieval Venice’s Response to Globalization, ''The Quarterly Journal of Economics'', Volume 129, Issue 2, 1 May 2014, Pages 753–821, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qju006&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus they asked for higher prices. For millenniums, about 10% of the population could eat food that may have been considered gourmet in their time&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Laudan, R. (2013). ''Cuisine and Empire: Cooking in World History''. University of California Press. &lt;/ref&gt;. Potentially 80% of the global population worked in food production and would have eaten more typical meals to survive&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The typical meal would be what they could most easily get their hands on. In Britain, for instance, that was gruels, vegetables, small amounts of wild game, and grains&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, K. (1997). Nutrition and the Early-Medieval Diet. ''Speculum,'' ''72''(1), 1-32. doi:10.2307/2865862&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another factor would be religious/cultural beliefs and customs, which have a significant impact on the food that was eaten. For instance, Jewish and Islamic cultures have rules for not only what they can eat, but how to prepare the food and what it can be paired with&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 14:6-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"Pork (لَحم الخنزير) From the Quranic Arabic Corpus – Ontology of Quranic Concepts". Retrieved 29 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;. To eat specific food items they must be Kosher (for Jews) and Halal (for Muslims)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The most obvious example is that neither can eat pork because pigs are considered unclean. Another example is that many people of India generally do not consume beef because many devout Hindus believe the cow is a sacred animal&lt;ref&gt;Krishna, Nanditha (2014), ''Sacred Animals of India'', Penguin Books Limited, pp. 80, 101–108, {{ISBN|978-81-8475-182-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Buddhism encourage vegetarianism so that limits what Buddhist can eat&lt;ref&gt;Buddhism &amp; Vegetarianism Archived 2013-10-21 at the [[Wayback Machine]].&lt;/ref&gt;. These practices and beliefs encourage what is not eaten and society but also what can be eaten. For instance, the Buddhists have a history of preparing and eating tofu to get protein&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. There is also the role of the state when it comes to these issues sometimes dictating how meals should be prepared&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. An example of this would be that of edicts of Ashoka who declared that many animals shall be given decent treatment and limited the numbers that could be consumed&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Chakravarti, Monmohan (1906). "Animals in the inscriptions of Piyadasi". ''Memoirs of the Asiatic Society of Bengal''. '''1''' (17): 361–374.&lt;/ref&gt;. Although, it should be noted Ashoka was a very devout Buddhist and that affected his policies&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

== Cultural exchange ==
This trading from non-local regions, also means, almost by necessity, that there was much cultural exchange between different groups to get these goods&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Ley, Willy (December 1965). "The Healthfull Aromatick Herbe". For Your Information. ''Galaxy Science Fiction''. pp. 88–98.&lt;/ref&gt;. The Columbian Exchange introduced many ingredients and styles to the new world and Europe starting with the expansion of the Iberian Empires&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. The new world introduced to Europeans tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate, and many more&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. Another example would be interactions with the Islamic world, which impacted catholic cuisine in the 1100s&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. These interactions introduced many spices, the theory of the culinary cosmos, and cooking items such as North African pottery&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. These trades were facilitated by rich merchant states that traded with them the most notable being Venice&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==Food==
''Gourmet'' may describe a class of restaurant, [[cuisine]], meal or ingredient of high quality, of special presentation, or high sophistication. In the United States, a 1980s gourmet food movement evolved from a long-term division between elitist (or "gourmet") tastes and a populist aversion to fancy foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States of Arugula:How We Became a Gourmet Nation|publisher=Doubleday Broadway|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gourmet is an industry classification for high-quality premium foods in the United States.  In the 2000s, there has been an accelerating increase in the American gourmet market, due in part to rising income, globalization of taste, and health and nutrition concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.packagedfacts.com/Gourmet-Specialty-Foods-1087756/|title=The U.S. Market for Gourmet and Specialty Foods and Beverages|publisher=Packaged Facts|date=September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual food and beverage categories, such as coffee, are often divided between a standard and a "gourmet" sub-market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=4559623&amp;page=1|title=From McMuffins to McLattes:McDonald's Chases Gourmet Coffee Market, Plans Massive Restaurant Upgrade|authors=Vicki Mabrey and Deborah Apton|date=March 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gourmet pursuits==
Certain events such as [[wine tasting]]s cater to people who consider themselves gourmets and [[foodie]]s. Television programs (such as those on the [[Food Network]]) and publications such as ''[[Gourmet (magazine)|Gourmet]]'' magazine often serve gourmets with [[food column]]s and features.  Gourmet tourism is a niche industry catering to people who travel to food or wine tastings, restaurants, or food and wine production regions for leisure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Niche Tourism: Contemporary Issues, Trends and Cases|author=Marina Novelli|year= 2004|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chow.com/grinder/tag/travel+industry+association+of+america |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070630233121/http://www.chow.com/grinder/tag/travel+industry+association+of+america |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 30, 2007 |title=Tour Buses on the Horizon |author=Christy Harrison |publisher=Travel Industry Association of America |date=March 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
''[[Foodie]]'' is often used by the media as a conversational [[synonym]] for ''gourmet'', although it is a different concept (that of a food aficionado). The word ''foodie'' was coined synchronously by [[Gael Greene]] in the magazine ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' and by [[Paul Levy (journalist)|Paul Levy]] and Ann Barr, co-authors of ''The Official Foodie Handbook'' (1984).

'''Henry Barraud''' (16 May 1811 &amp;ndash; 17 June 1874) was an English portrait, [[Subject painting|subject]] and animal painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Barraud, Henry|volume=3|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rehs.com/Henry_Barraud_Bio.html Biography] (Rehs Galleries inc.).&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early life==
Barraud was born in London, one of 17 children of William Francis Barraud (1783–1833), a clerk in the [[Custom House, London|Custom House]], and Sophia (née) Hull. His paternal grandfather was Paul Philip Barraud&lt;ref&gt;Gordon-Gorman, William James. ''[https://archive.org/details/a583403600gorduoft Converts to Rome : a biographical list of the more notable converts to the Catholic Church in the United Kingdom during the last sixty years]'' (London: Sands, 1910) p33.&lt;/ref&gt; an eminent [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] maker in [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]], and his maternal grandfather, Thomas Hull, a miniature painter. The family was of French [[Huguenot]] origin that had come over to England at the time of the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]]. His elder brother [[William Barraud]] became a notable animal painter. Another brother, Edward, also had a talent for art, but did not pursue it professionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnbennettfinepaintings.co.uk/johnbennett_fine_paintings/dogs_birds_other_animals/292.asp William Barraud] (John Bennett Fine Paintings).&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his brother, Henry excelled in painting animals, but his works were chiefly portraits, with horses and dogs, and subject pictures, such as 'The Pope blessing the Animals' (painted in 1842), many of which were executed in conjunction with his brother. He exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] from 1833 to 1859, and at the [[British Institution]] and [[Society of British Artists]] between the years 1831 and 1868. The two brothers shared a studio from 1835 until William's death in 1850, and in their joint pictures William painted the animals and Henry the figures. They also produced a book entitled "Sketches of Figures and Animals", (H. Graves and Co., c.1850).
==Works==
Barraud's most popular works were: "We praise Thee, O God"; "The London Season, a scene in Hyde Park"; "Lord's Cricket Ground"; and "The Lobby of the House of Commons" (painted in 1872), all of which were [[Engraving|engraved]] or [[autotype]]d. He was also commissioned to paint several royal portraits.
==Death==
Barraud died at his home in Gloucester Place, London on 17 June 1874, in his sixty-fourth year.
==Personal life==
His son [[Francis Barraud]] (1856–1924) was also an artist&amp;mdash;best remembered for his painting of "Nipper" the dog on the "[[His Master's Voice]]" record label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave |grid=10852037 |name=F J Barraud }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another son [[Herbert Rose Barraud]] (1845 &amp;ndash; c1896) was a noted portrait photographer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7527">'''Herbert Greenwald''' (August 16, 1915 – February 3, 1959) was a [[Chicago]] real estate developer who utilized [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] as the design architect for several landmark modern residential buildings.

==Personal life==
Herbert "Squiff" Greenwald was born and raised in St. Louis.  He pursued rabbinical studies at Yeshiva University in New York.  After serving in the military during World War II, he studied philosophy at University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schulze|first1=Franz|title=Mies van der Rohe: A Critical Biography|date=1995|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226151458|page=276|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He used money inherited from the death of his mother in 1949 to go into the real estate business with Samuel Katzin.&lt;ref&gt;The Third Coast: When Chicago Built the American Dream By Thomas L. Dyja Penguin Press 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert S. Greenwald was married to Lillian Feldman Greenwald (Dec. 31, 1915 to Sept. 7, 2007).  They had two sons, Michael and Bennet. Together they supported artists including: [[Leon Golub]], [[Nancy Spero]],&lt;ref&gt;Leon Golub: Echoes of the Real By Jon Bird Reaktion Books, London 2000 page 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cosmo Campoli]], Misch Cohen, [[Ruth Duckworth]], [[Richard Hunt (sculptor)]], David Sharpe, [[Martha Schlamme]] and Abraham Stokman.&lt;ref&gt;

Lillian Greenwald earned a BA degree and a M.SW degree from the University of Chicago. She served on the Visiting Committee of the University's School of Social Services Administration and may have influence the decision to use Mies van der Rohe to design the School of Social Services building.&lt;ref&gt;

== Real estate development ==
Greenwald developed three residential buildings in Evanston, Il by 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Mies van der Rohe: A Critical Biography, New and Revised Edition By Franz Schulze, Edward Windhorst page 276&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Greenwald sought a famous architect to design his first important building. After failing to hire [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Le Corbusier]], [[Eliel Saarinen]], and [[Walter Gropius]]. He followed Gropius's recommendation to hire Mies van der Rohe.&lt;ref&gt;Mies van der Rohe: A Critical Biography, New and Revised Edition By Franz Schulze, Edward Windhorst page 276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://miespromontoryapartments.com/history.html] Promontory Apartments: An Architectural History by Alfred Swenson&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenwald utilized Mies on several projects including:
* The Promontory, 5530 S. South Shore Drive, Chicago, IL (1949)
* [[860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]], Chicago, IL (1949-1951)

* Commonwealth Plaza, 330-340 W. Diversey Parkway, Chicago, IL (1953-1956)
* [[Lafayette Park, Detroit]], MI (1955-1963)

Additionally, he worked with Mies on several unbuilt designs including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.iit.edu/grc/mies/mies_work_alpha.html] Illinois Institute of Technology, "Mies Work"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mies Designed Single Family Homes==
In addition to the proposed home for Herbert Greenwald in Lake Forest, Mies designed single family homes for: 
*Greenwald's brother, Morris Greenwald. The home was later renovated and expanded by [[Peter Gluck]], located at 11 Homeward Lake, Weston, Connecticut&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moderndesign.org/2006/04/mies-van-der-rohe-morris-greenwald.html] Modern Design by ModernDesign.org 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Greenwald's business partner, Robert Hall McCormick. The home is now part of the Elmhurst Art Museum in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elmhurstartmuseum.org/explore/history-mccormick-house] History of the McCormick House, Elmhurst Art Museum website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Greenwald died in the crash of [[American Airlines Flight 320]] from Midway International Airport to New York City's LaGuardia Airport on February 3, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.gendisasters.com/new-york/3620/new-york-city,-ny-plane-crashes-east-river,-feb-1959] New York Plane Crashes East River&lt;/ref&gt; The plane crashed in the East River and his body was not recovered.

'''Innovation''' can be simply defined as a "new idea, creative thoughts, new imaginations in form of device or method".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/innovation |title= Innovation  |publisher= Merriam-Webster |website= Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate= 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better [[problem solving | solutions]] that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing[[market (economics) | market]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maranville, S.|title=Entrepreneurship in the Business Curriculum|journal=Journal of Education for Business|volume=68|pages=27–31|doi=10.1080/08832323.1992.10117582|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such innovation takes place through the provision of more-effective [[product (business)|product]]s, [[Procedure (term)|processes]], [[Service (economics)|service]]s, [[technologies]], or [[business model]]s that are made available to [[Market (economics)|market]]s, [[government]]s and [[society]]. The term "innovation" can be defined{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that "breaks into" the market or society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.hitech.2009.02.002|title=Questioning two myths in innovation literature|journal=The Journal of High Technology Management Research|volume=20|pages=40–51|year=2009|last1=Frankelius|first1=Per}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and [[Founder CEO|founders]] in [[startups]], rather than existing organizations. Innovation is related to, but not the same as, [[invention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-the-difference-between-invention-and-innovation-2012-4 | title = This Is The Difference Between 'Invention' And 'Innovation' | first = Kim | last = Bhasin | date = 2012-04-02 | work = Business Insider }}&lt;/ref&gt; as innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention (i.e. new/improved ability) to make a meaningful impact in the market or society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/09/10/whats-the-difference-between-invention-and-innovation/ | title=What's the Difference Between Invention and Innovation?|publisher=Forbes|date=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not all innovations require an invention. Innovation often{{quantify|date=April 2018}} manifests itself via the [[engineering]] process, when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature. The opposite of innovation is [[exnovation]].

Pronunciation of the word has long been argued about due to the unusual sounding of the o becoming an i. The phonetic sound would suggest a spelling of inivative if taken at the word of a true scholar. 

While a novel device is often described{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} as an innovation, in economics, [[management science]], and other fields of practice and analysis, innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in such a way that they affect society. In [[industrial economics]], innovations are created and found{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} empirically from services to meet growing [[consumer]] [[demand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/general/34749412.pdf Growth in Services].

==Definition==
A 2014 survey of literature on innovation found over 40 definitions. In an industrial survey of how the [[software industry]] defined innovation, the following definition given by Crossan and Apaydin was considered to be the most complete, which  builds on the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]] manual's definition:&lt;ref name="Henry2014"&gt;Edison, H.,  Ali, N.B., &amp; Torkar, R. (2014). [http://www.torkar.se/resources/jss-edisonNT13.pdf Towards innovation measurement in the software industry]. ''Journal of Systems and Software'' 86(5), 1390–407.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Innovation is production or adoption, assimilation, and exploitation of a value-added novelty in economic and social spheres; renewal and enlargement of products, services, and markets; development of new methods of production; and the establishment of new management systems. It is both a process and an outcome.}}

According to Kanter innovation includes original invention and creative use and defines innovation as a generation, admission and realization of new ideas, products, services and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Innovation in American Government: Challenges, Opportunities, and Dilemmas|last=|first=|publisher=Brookings Inst Pr|isbn=9780815703587|location=|pages=|date=1997-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main dimensions of innovation were degree of [[novelty (patent)]] (i.e. whether an innovation is new to the firm, new to the market, new to the industry, or new to the world) and kind of innovation (i.e. whether it is processor [[product-service system]] innovation).&lt;ref name="Henry2014" /&gt; In recent organizational scholarship, researchers of workplaces have also distinguished innovation to be separate from creativity, by providing an updated definition of these two related but distinct constructs:{{quote|Workplace creativity concerns the cognitive and behavioral processes applied when attempting to generate novel ideas. Workplace innovation concerns the processes applied when attempting to implement new ideas. Specifically, innovation involves some combination of problem/opportunity identification, the introduction, adoption or modification of new ideas germane to organizational needs, the promotion of these ideas, and the practical implementation of these ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=D.

==Inter-disciplinary views==

===Business and economics===
{{main|innovation economics}}
In [[commerce|business]] and in [[economics]], innovation can become a catalyst for growth. With rapid advancements in [[transportation]] and [[communications]] over the past few decades, the old-world concepts of [[factor endowment]]s and [[comparative advantage]] which focused on an area's unique inputs are outmoded for today's [[globalization|global economy]]. Economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883–1950), who contributed greatly to the study of [[innovation economics]], argued that industries must incessantly revolutionize the economic structure from within, that is innovate with better or more effective processes and products, as well as market distribution, such as the connection from the craft shop to factory. He famously asserted that "[[creative destruction]] is the essential fact about [[capitalism]]".&lt;ref name=capsocdem&gt;{{cite book | author = Schumpeter, J. A. | authorlink = Joseph Schumpeter | year = 1943 | title = Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy | publisher = Routledge | edition = 6 | pages = 81–84 | isbn = 978-0-415-10762-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Entrepreneur]]s continuously look for better ways to satisfy their [[consumer demand|consumer base]] with improved quality, durability, service and price which come to fruition in innovation with advanced technologies and organizational strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Heyne, P., Boettke, P. J., and Prychitko, D. L. (2010). ''The Economic Way of Thinking''. Prentice Hall, 12th ed. pp. 163, 317–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A prime example of innovation involved the explosive boom of [[Silicon Valley]] startups out of the [[Stanford Industrial Park]]. In 1957, dissatisfied employees of [[Shockley Semiconductor]], the company of [[Nobel laureate]] and co-inventor of the [[transistor]] [[William Shockley]], left to form an independent firm, [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. After several years, Fairchild developed into a formidable presence in the sector. Eventually, these founders left to start their own companies based on their own, unique, latest ideas, and then leading employees started their own firms. Over the next 20 years, this snowball process launched the momentous [[startup company|startup-company]] explosion of [[information technology|information-technology]] firms. Essentially, Silicon Valley began as 65 new enterprises born out of Shockley's eight former employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url= http://www.netvalley.com/svhistory.html |title= Silicon Valley History &amp; Future |website= Netvalley.com |date= |accessdate= 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, hubs of innovation have sprung up globally with similar [[metonym]]s, including [[Silicon Alley]] encompassing [[New York City]].

Another example involves [[business incubator]]s – a phenomenon nurtured by governments around the world, close to knowledge clusters (mostly research-based) like universities or other [[Government Excellence Centre]]s – which aim primarily to channel generated knowledge to applied innovation outcomes in order to stimulate regional or national [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizations===
In the organizational context, innovation may be linked to positive changes in [[efficiency]], [[productivity]], [[Quality (business)|quality]], [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]], and [[market share]]. However, recent research findings highlight the complementary role of organizational culture in enabling organizations to translate innovative activity into tangible performance improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02529.x|title=Benefiting from Public Sector Innovation: The Moderating Role of Customer and Learning Orientation|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=72|issue=4|pages=550–559|year=2012|last1=Salge|first1=Torsten Oliver|last2=Vera|first2=Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations can also improve profits and performance by providing work groups opportunities and resources to innovate, in addition to employee's core job tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1464-0597.00951|title=Sparkling Fountains or Stagnant Ponds: An Integrative Model of Creativity and Innovation Implementation in Work Groups|journal=Applied Psychology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=355–387|year=2002|last1=West|first1=Michael A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Drucker]] wrote:

According to Clayton Christensen, [[disruptive innovation]] is the key to future success in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Christensen, Clayton &amp; Overdorf, Michael|year=2000|title=Meeting the Challenge of Disruptive Change|url=https://hbr.org/2000/03/meeting-the-challenge-of-disruptive-change|journal=Harvard Business Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage.

While disruptive innovation will typically "attack a traditional business model with a lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly,"&lt;ref name=hbr201701/&gt; foundational innovation is slower, and typically has the potential to create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term. Foundational innovation tends to transform business [[operating model]]s as entirely new business models [[emergence|emerge]] over many years, with gradual and steady adoption of the innovation leading to waves of [[technological change|technological]] and [[institution]]al change that gain momentum more slowly.&lt;ref name=hbr201701&gt;

Still other innovative strategies include [[hospital]]s digitizing medical information in [[electronic medical records]]. For example, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s [[HOPE VI]] initiatives turned severely distressed [[public housing]] in urban areas into [[Urban renewal|revitalized]], mixed-income environments; the [[Harlem Children’s Zone]] used a community-based approach to educate local area children; and the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Brownfield regulation and development|brownfield grants]] facilitates turning over [[brownfield]]s for [[environmental protection]], [[Open space reserve|green spaces]], [[Community development|community]] and [[Commerce|commercial development]].

===Sources ===
There are several sources of innovation. It can occur as a result of a focus effort by a range of different agents, by chance, or as a result of a major system failure.

According to [[Peter F. Drucker]], the general sources of innovations are different changes in industry structure, in market structure, in local and global demographics, in human perception, mood and meaning, in the amount of already available scientific knowledge, etc.&lt;ref name=Drucker/&gt;

[[File:Technological Change.jpg|thumb|Original model of three phases of the process of Technological Change]]
In the simplest [[linear model of innovation]] the traditionally recognized source is ''manufacturer innovation''. This is where an agent (person or business) innovates in order to sell the innovation. Specifically, R&amp;D measurement is the commonly used input for innovation, in particular in the business sector, named Business Expenditure on R&amp;D (BERD) that grew over the years on the expenses of the declining R&amp;D invested by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H. Rubin|first=Tzameret|year=2015|title=The Achilles heel of a strong private knowledge sector: evidence from Israel|url=http://nimbusvault.net/publications/koala/inimpact/papers/inkt14-011.pdf|journal=The Journal of Innovation Impact|volume=7 |issue=1|pages=80–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source of innovation, only now becoming widely recognized, is ''end-user innovation''. This is where an agent (person or company) develops an innovation for their own (personal or in-house) use because existing products do not meet their needs. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] economist [[Eric von Hippel]] has identified end-user innovation as, by far, the most important and critical in his classic book on the subject, ''The Sources of Innovation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books/sources/SofI.pdf |title=The Sources of Innovation |last=Von Hippel |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric von Hippel |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1988 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012160410/http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books/sources/SofI.pdf |archivedate=12 October 2006 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The robotics engineer [[Joseph F. Engelberger]] asserts that innovations require only three things:
# A recognized need,
# Competent people with relevant technology, and
# Financial support.&lt;ref&gt;Engelberger, J. F. (1982). "Robotics in practice: Future capabilities". ''Electronic Servicing &amp; Technology'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, innovation processes usually involve: identifying customer needs, macro and meso trends, developing competences, and finding financial support.

The Kline [[chain-linked model]] of innovation&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1985). ''Research, Invention, Innovation and Production: Models and Reality, Report INN-1'', March 1985, Mechanical Engineering Department, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; places emphasis on potential market needs as drivers of the innovation process, and describes the complex and often iterative feedback loops between marketing, design, manufacturing, and R&amp;D.

Innovation by businesses is achieved in many ways, with much attention now given to formal [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) for "breakthrough innovations". R&amp;D help spur on patents and other scientific innovations that leads to productive growth in such areas as industry, medicine, engineering, and government.&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"&gt;Mark, M., Katz, B., Rahman, S., and Warren, D. (2008) [https://www.brookings.edu/research/metropolicy-shaping-a-new-federal-partnership-for-a-metropolitan-nation/ ''MetroPolicy: Shaping A New Federal Partnership for a Metropolitan Nation'']. Brookings Institution: Metropolitan Policy Program Report. pp. 4–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, innovations can be developed by less formal on-the-job modifications of practice, through exchange and combination of professional experience and by many other routes. Investigation of relationship between the concepts of innovation and technology transfer revealed overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286542154 |title=Perspectives on Innovation and Technology Transfer |last=Dubickis, M. |first=Gaile-Sarkane, E. |publisher=[[ScienceDirect]] |year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more radical and revolutionary innovations tend to emerge from R&amp;D, while more incremental innovations may emerge from practice – but there are many exceptions to each of these trends.

[[Information technology]] and changing business processes and management style can produce a work climate favorable to innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq |publisher=Forbes India Magazine |title= New Trends in Innovation Management |website=Forbesindia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the software tool company [[Atlassian]] conducts quarterly "ShipIt Days" in which employees may work on anything related to the company's products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.atlassian.com/company/about/shipit |title=ShipIt Days |publisher=Atlassian |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google employees work on self-directed projects for 20% of their time (known as [[Innovation Time Off]]). Both companies cite these bottom-up processes as major sources for new products and features.

An important innovation factor includes customers buying products or using services. As a result, firms may incorporate users in [[focus group]]s (user centred approach), work closely with so called [[lead users]] (lead user approach) or users might adapt their products themselves. The lead user method focuses on idea generation based on leading users to develop breakthrough innovations. U-STIR, a project to innovate [[Europe]]’s surface [[transportation]] system, employs such workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.u-stir.eu/index.phtml?id=2537&amp;ID1=2537&amp;sprache=en |title=U-STIR |publisher=U-stir.eu |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918055455/http://www.u-stir.eu/index.phtml?id=2537&amp;ID1=2537&amp;sprache=en |archivedate=18 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this [[user innovation]], a great deal of innovation is done by those actually implementing and using technologies and products as part of their normal activities. Sometimes user-innovators may become [[entrepreneur]]s, selling their product, they may choose to trade their innovation in exchange for other innovations, or they may be adopted by their suppliers. Nowadays, they may also choose to freely reveal their innovations, using methods like [[open source]]. In such networks of innovation the users or communities of users can further develop technologies and reinvent their social meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Tuomi, I. (2002). ''Networks of Innovation''.

University of Turku.&lt;/ref&gt;

One technique for innovating a solution to an identified problem is to actually attempt an experiment with many possible solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/the-mission/forget-about-the-10-000-hour-rule-7b7a39343523 Forget The 10,000-Hour Rule; Edison, Bezos, &amp; Zuckerberg Follow The 10,000-Experiment Rule]. Medium.com (2017-10-26). Retrieved on 2018-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was famously used by Thomas Edison's laboratory to find a version of the [[incandescent light bulb]] economically viable for home use, which involved searching through thousands of possible [[electrical filament|filament]] designs before settling on carbonized bamboo.

This technique is sometimes used in pharmaceutical [[drug discovery]]. Thousands of chemical compounds are subjected to [[high-throughput screening]] to see if they have any activity against a target molecule which has been identified as biologically significant to a disease. Promising compounds can then be studied; modified to improve efficacy, reduce side effects, and reduce cost of manufacture; and if successful turned into treatments.

The related technique of [[A/B testing]] is often used to help optimize the design of [[web site]]s and [[mobile app]]s.  This is used by major sites such as [[amazon.com]], [[Facebook]], [[Google]], and [[Netflix]].&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;[https://www.fastcompany.com/3063846/why-these-tech-companies-keep-running-thousands-of-failed Why These Tech Companies Keep Running Thousands Of Failed Experiments].

===Goals and failures===
Programs of organizational innovation are typically tightly linked to organizational goals and objectives, to the [[business plan]], and to [[Market (economics)|market]] [[Competition (companies)|competitive positioning]]. One driver for innovation programs in corporations is to achieve growth objectives. As Davila et al. (2006) notes, "Companies cannot grow through cost reduction and reengineering alone... Innovation is the key element in providing aggressive top-line growth, and for increasing bottom-line results".&lt;ref name="Making Innovation Work"&gt;Davila, T., Epstein, M. J., and Shelton, R. (2006). "Making Innovation Work: How to Manage It, Measure It, and Profit from It." Upper Saddle River: Wharton School Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

One survey across a large number of manufacturing and services organizations found, ranked in decreasing order of popularity, that systematic programs of organizational innovation are most frequently driven by: improved [[quality (business)|quality]], creation of new [[Market (economics)|market]]s, extension of the [[product (business)|product]] range, reduced [[labor cost]]s, improved [[production process]]es, reduced materials, reduced [[environmental damage]], replacement of [[product (business)|product]]s/[[Service (economics)|services]], reduced [[energy]] consumption, conformance to [[regulation]]s.&lt;ref name="Making Innovation Work"/&gt;

These goals vary between improvements to products, processes and services and dispel a popular myth that innovation deals mainly with new product development. Most of the goals could apply to any organisation be it a manufacturing facility, marketing firm, hospital or local government. Whether innovation goals are successfully achieved or otherwise depends greatly on the environment prevailing in the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1287/mnsc.35.5.597|title=Innovative and Noninnovative Small Firms: Types and Characteristics|journal=Management Science|volume=35|issue=5|pages=597–606|year=1989|last1=Khan|first1=Arshad M.|last2=Manopichetwattana|first2=V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, failure can develop in programs of innovations. The causes of failure have been widely researched and can vary considerably. Some causes will be external to the organization and outside its influence of control. Others will be internal and ultimately within the control of the organization. Internal causes of failure can be divided into causes associated with the cultural infrastructure and causes associated with the innovation process itself. Common causes of failure within the innovation process in most organizations can be distilled into five types: poor goal definition, poor alignment of actions to goals, poor participation in teams, poor monitoring of results, poor communication and access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Sullivan, David |year=2002|title=Framework for Managing Development in the Networked Organisations|journal=Journal of Computers in Industry|volume= 47|issue=1|pages=77–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diffusion==
[[File:InnovationLifeCycle.jpg|thumb|right]]
{{main|Diffusion of innovations}}

Diffusion of innovation research was first started in 1903 by seminal researcher [[Gabriel Tarde]], who first plotted the S-shaped [[diffusion curve]]. Tarde defined the innovation-decision process as a series of steps that includes:&lt;ref&gt;Tarde, G.  (1903). ''The laws of imitation'' (E. Clews Parsons, Trans.). New York: H. Holt &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
# First knowledge
# Forming an attitude
# A decision to adopt or reject
# Implementation and use
# Confirmation of the decision

Once innovation occurs, innovations may be spread from the innovator to other individuals and groups. This process has been proposed that the life cycle of innovations can be described using the '[[Sigmoid function|s-curve]]' or [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion curve]]. The s-curve maps growth of revenue or productivity against time. In the early stage of a particular innovation, growth is relatively slow as the new product establishes itself. At some point, customers begin to demand and the product growth increases more rapidly. New incremental innovations or changes to the product allow growth to continue. Towards the end of its lifecycle, growth slows and may even begin to decline. In the later stages, no amount of new investment in that product will yield a normal rate of return

The s-curve derives from an assumption that new products are likely to have "product life" – i.e., a start-up phase, a rapid increase in revenue and eventual decline. In fact, the great majority of innovations never get off the bottom of the curve, and never produce normal returns.

Innovative companies will typically be working on new innovations that will eventually replace older ones. Successive s-curves will come along to replace older ones and continue to drive growth upwards. In the figure above the first curve shows a current technology. The second shows an [[emerging technologies|emerging technology]] that currently yields lower growth but will eventually overtake current technology and lead to even greater levels of growth. The length of life will depend on many factors.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E. M. (1962). ''Diffusion of Innovation''. New York, NY: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==
Measuring innovation is inherently difficult as it implies commensurability so that comparisons can be made in quantitative terms. Innovation, however, is by definition novelty. Comparisons are thus often meaningless across products or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of innovation|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Fagerberg, Jan., Mowery, David C., Nelson, Richard R.|isbn=9780199264551|location=Oxford|oclc=56655392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Edison et al.&lt;ref name="Henry2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Edison, H.,  Ali, N.B., &amp; Torkar, R.|doi=10.1016/j.jss.2013.01.013|url=http://www.torkar.se/resources/jss-edisonNT13.pdf |title=Towards innovation measurement in the software industry|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|volume=86|issue=5|pages=1390–1407|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their review of literature on [[innovation management]] found 232 innovation metrics. They categorized these measures along five dimensions i.e. inputs to the innovation process, output from the innovation process, effect of the innovation output, measures to access the activities in an innovation process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process.&lt;ref name="Henry2013" /&gt;

There are two different types of measures for innovation: the organizational level and the political level.

===Organizational level===
The measure of innovation at the organizational level relates to individuals, team-level assessments, and private companies from the smallest to the largest company. Measure of innovation for organizations can be conducted by surveys, workshops, consultants, or internal benchmarking. There is today no established general way to measure organizational innovation. Corporate measurements are generally structured around [[balanced scorecard]]s which cover several aspects of innovation such as business measures related to finances, innovation process efficiency, employees' contribution and motivation, as well benefits for customers. Measured values will vary widely between businesses, covering for example new product revenue, spending in R&amp;D, time to market, customer and employee perception &amp; satisfaction, number of patents, additional sales resulting from past innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Davila, Tony; Marc J. Epstein and Robert Shelton (2006). ''Making Innovation Work: How to Manage It, Measure It, and Profit from It''. Upper Saddle River: Wharton School Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political level===
For the political level, measures of innovation are more focused on a country or region [[competitive advantage]] through innovation. In this context, organizational capabilities can be evaluated through various evaluation frameworks, such as those of the European Foundation for Quality Management. The [[OECD]] Oslo Manual (1995) suggests standard guidelines on measuring technological product and process innovation. Some people consider the [[Oslo Manual]] complementary to the [[Frascati Manual]] from 1963. The new Oslo manual from 2005 takes a wider perspective to innovation, and includes marketing and organizational innovation. These standards are used for example in the European [[Community Innovation Survey]]s.&lt;ref&gt;OECD The Measurement of Scientific and Technological Activities. Proposed Guidelines for Collecting and Interpreting Technological Innovation Data. Oslo Manual. 2nd edition, DSTI, OECD / European Commission Eurostat, Paris 31 December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ways of measuring innovation have traditionally been expenditure, for example, investment in R&amp;D (Research and Development) as percentage of GNP (Gross National Product). Whether this is a good measurement of innovation has been widely discussed and the Oslo Manual has incorporated some of the critique against earlier methods of measuring. The traditional methods of measuring still inform many policy decisions. The EU [[Lisbon Strategy]] has set as a goal that their average expenditure on R&amp;D should be 3% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/ |title=Industrial innovation – Enterprise and Industry |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827125633/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/ |archivedate=27 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Level Down of Innovation in Silicon Valley ===
Innovation is starting to decline due to the newly introduced immigration policies. The new immigration policies have effects on the economy because 25% of the companies were created by foreign entrepreneurs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/08/30/why-startups-are-leaving-silicon-valley|title=Why startups are leaving Silicon Valley|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indicators===
Many scholars claim that there is a great bias towards the "science and technology mode" (S&amp;T-mode or STI-mode), while the "learning by doing, using and interacting mode" (DUI-mode) is ignored and measurements and research about it rarely done. For example, an institution may be high tech with the latest equipment, but lacks crucial doing, using and interacting tasks important for innovation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

A common industry view (unsupported by empirical evidence) is that comparative [[cost-effectiveness]] research is a form of [[price controls|price control]] which reduces returns to industry, and thus limits R&amp;D expenditure, stifles future innovation and compromises new products access to markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19523121|pmc=2881450|year=2009|last1=Chalkidou|first1=K.|title=Comparative effectiveness research and evidence-based health policy: Experience from four countries|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=87|issue=2|pages=339–67|last2=Tunis|first2=S.|last3=Lopert|first3=R.|last4=Rochaix|first4=L.|last5=Sawicki|first5=P. T.|last6=Nasser|first6=M.|last7=Xerri|first7=B.|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00560.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some academics claim cost-effectiveness research is a valuable value-based measure of innovation which accords "truly significant" therapeutic advances (i.e. providing "health gain") higher prices than free market mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roughead |first=E. |last2=Lopert |first2=R. |last3=Sansom |first3=L. |title=Prices for innovative pharmaceutical products that provide health gain: a comparison between Australia and the United States Value |journal=[[Health (journal)|Health]] |year=2007 |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=514–20 |doi=10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00206.x |pmid=17970935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[value-based pricing]] has been viewed as a means of indicating to industry the type of innovation that should be rewarded from the public purse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=B. |title=Payers Growing Influence on R&amp;D Decision Making |journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery |year=2008 |volume=7 |issue= 11|pages=876–78 |doi=10.1038/nrd2749 |pmid=18974741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Australian]] academic developed the case that national comparative [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] systems should be viewed as measuring "health innovation" as an [[evidence-based policy]] concept for valuing innovation distinct from valuing through competitive markets, a method which requires strong [[anti-trust]] laws to be effective, on the basis that both methods of assessing [[pharmaceutical innovations]] are mentioned in annex 2C.1 of the [[AUSFTA|Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faunce |first=T. |last2=Bai |first2=J. |last3=Nguyen |first3=D. |title=Impact of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement on Australian medicines regulation and prices |journal=[[Journal of Generic Medicines]] |year=2010 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=18–29 |doi=10.1057/jgm.2009.40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Faunce TA|title=Global intellectual property protection of 'innovative' pharmaceuticals: Challenges for bioethics and health law in B Bennett and G Tomossy|publisher=Globalization and Health Springer|date=2006|url=http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Ch%20Globalisation%20and%20Health%20Fau.pdf|format=PDF|website=Law.anu.edu.au|accessdate=18 June 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414040804/http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Ch%20Globalisation%20and%20Health%20Fau.pdf|archivedate=14 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faunce |first=T.

===Rankings===
Many research studies try to rank countries based on measures of innovation. Common areas of focus include: [[high-tech]] companies, [[manufacturing]], [[patent]]s, [[post secondary education]], [[research and development]],  and research personnel. The left ranking of the top 10 countries below is based on the 2016 [[Bloomberg Innovation Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-19/these-are-the-world-s-most-innovative-economies|title=These Are the World's Most Innovative Economies|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies may vary widely; for example the [[Global Innovation Index]] 2016 ranks [[Switzerland]] as number one wherein countries like [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] do not even make the top ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://de.statista.com/infografik/5509/die-10-innovativsten-laender-weltweit-nach-dem-global-innovation-index/|title=Infografik: Schweiz bleibt globaler Innovationsführer|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista Infografiken|publisher=Statista (In German)|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future ===
In 2005 [[Jonathan Huebner]], a [[physicist]] working at the [[Pentagon Building|Pentagon]]'s [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake|Naval Air Warfare Center]], argued on the basis of both U.S. [[patent]]s and world technological breakthroughs, per capita, that the rate of human technological innovation peaked in 1873 and has been slowing ever since.&lt;ref name=Huebner&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huebner | first1 = J. | title = A possible declining trend for worldwide innovation | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2005.01.003 | journal = [[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]] | volume = 72 | issue = 8 | pages = 980–986 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/050707/7inventor.htm|title=Science: Wanna be an inventor? Don't bother| last=Hayden|first=Thomas|date=7 July 2005|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article, he asked "Will the level of technology reach a maximum and then decline as in the Dark Ages?"&lt;ref name=Huebner/&gt; In later comments to ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine, Huebner clarified that while he believed that we will reach a rate of innovation in 2024 equivalent to that of the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], he was not predicting the reoccurrence of the Dark Ages themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adler|first=Robert|title=Entering a dark age of innovation|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7616-entering-a-dark-age-of-innovation.html|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=New Scientist|date=2 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Smart]] criticized the claim and asserted that [[technological singularity]] researcher [[Ray Kurzweil]] and others showed a "clear trend of acceleration, not deceleration" when it came to innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smart | first1 = J. | title = Discussion of Huebner article | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2005.07.001 | journal = [[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]] | volume = 72 | issue = 8 | pages = 988–995 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation replied to Huebner the journal his article was published in, citing [[Second Life]] and [[eHarmony]] as proof of accelerating innovation; to which Huebner replied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huebner|first1=Jonathan|title=Response by the Authors|journal=[[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]]|volume=72|issue=8|pages=995–1000|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2005.05.008|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, Huebner's findings were confirmed in 2010 with [[U.S. Patent Office]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Strumsky | first1 = D. | last2 = Lobo | first2 = J. | last3 = Tainter | first3 = J. A. | doi = 10.1002/sres.1057 | title = Complexity and the productivity of innovation | journal = Systems Research and Behavioral Science | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | page = 496 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in a 2012 paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Robert J. |title=Is U.S. Economic Growth Over? Faltering Innovation Confronts the Six Headwinds |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 18315 |date=2012 |doi=10.3386/w18315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation and Development===
The theme of innovation as a tool to disrupting patterns of poverty has gained momentum since the mid-2000s among major [[international development]] actors such as [[DFID]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dfid.blog.gov.uk/author/jonathan-wong-head-of-dfids-innovation-hub/ |title=Jonathan Wong, Head of DFID's Innovation Hub &amp;#124; DFID bloggers |website=Dfid.blog.gov.uk |date=2014-09-24 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gates Foundation]]'s use of the [[Grand Challenge]] funding model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2014/10/Gates-Foundation-Grand-Challenges-Breakthrough-Science |title=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Grand Challenge Partners Commit to Innovation with New Investments in Breakthrough Science – Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation |website=Gatesfoundation.org |date=2014-10-07 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[USAID]]'s Global Development Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/GlobalDevLab |title=Global Development Lab &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |website=Usaid.gov |date=2015-08-05 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Networks have been established to support innovation in development, such as D-Lab at [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d-lab.mit.edu/idin |title=International Development Innovation Network (IDIN) &amp;#124; D-Lab |website=D-lab.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment funds have been established to identify and catalyze innovations in [[developing countries]], such as DFID's Global Innovation Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/international-development-funding/global-innovation-fund |title=Global Innovation Fund International development funding |website=GOV.UK |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Development Innovation Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hdif-tz.org |title=Human Development Innovation Fund (HDIF) |website=Hdif-tz.org |date=2015-08-14 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (in partnership with USAID) the Global Development Innovation Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/usaid-and-dfid-announce-global-development-innovation-ventures |title=USAID and DFID Announce Global Development Innovation Ventures to Invest in Breakthrough Solutions to World Poverty &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |website=Usaid.gov |date=2013-06-06 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government policies==
Given the noticeable effects on [[efficiency]], [[quality of life]], and [[productivity|productive growth]], innovation is a key factor in society and economy. Consequently, policymakers have long worked to develop environments that will foster innovation and its resulting positive benefits, from funding [[Research and Development]] to supporting regulatory change, funding the development of innovation clusters, and using public purchasing and standardisation to 'pull' innovation through.

For instance, experts are advocating that the U.S. federal government launch a National Infrastructure Foundation, a nimble, collaborative strategic intervention organization that will house innovations programs from fragmented silos under one entity, inform federal officials on innovation [[performance measurement|performance metrics]], strengthen industry-university partnerships, and support innovation [[economic development]] initiatives, especially to strengthen [[business cluster|regional clusters]]. Because clusters are the geographic incubators of innovative products and processes, a cluster development grant program would also be targeted for implementation. By focusing on innovating in such areas as precision [[manufacturing]], [[information technology]], and [[clean energy]], other areas of national concern would be tackled including [[government debt]], [[carbon footprint]], and [[oil dependence]].&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"/&gt; The U.S. [[Economic Development Administration]] understand this reality in their continued Regional Innovation Clusters initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eda.gov/PDF/EDA_FY_2010_Annual_Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=U.S. Economic Development Administration : Fiscal Year 2010 Annual Report |website=Eda.gov |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, federal grants in R&amp;D, a crucial driver of innovation and productive growth, should be expanded to levels similar to [[Japan]], [[Finland]], [[South Korea]], and [[Switzerland]] in order to stay globally competitive. Also, such grants should be better procured to [[metropolitan economy|metropolitan areas]], the essential engines of the American economy.&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"/&gt;

Many countries recognize the importance of research and development as well as innovation including Japan's [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/a06.htm |title=Science and Technology |publisher=MEXT |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905171421/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/a06.htm |archivedate=5 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmbf.de/en/Ministry.php |title=BMBF " Ministry |publisher=Bmbf.de |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Science and Technology]] in the People's Republic of China. Furthermore, Russia's innovation programme is the [[Medvedev modernisation programme]] which aims at creating a diversified economy based on high technology and innovation. Also, the [[Government of Western Australia]] has established a number of innovation incentives for government departments. [[Landgate]] was the first Western Australian government agency to establish its Innovation Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landgate.wa.gov.au/innovation |title=Home  |publisher=Landgate Innovation Program |website=Landgate.wa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regions]] have taken a more proactive role in supporting innovation. Many regional governments are setting up [[regional innovation agency]] to strengthen regional innovation capabilities. In [[Medellin]], [[Colombia]], the municipality of Medellin created in 2009 [[Ruta N]] to transform the city into a knowledge city.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23792949.2018.1538702?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Comas Quesada''' (3 February 1928 – 14 January 1993) was a Canarian painter born in the [[Puerto de la Luz]], [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]]. He is considered one of the greatest exponents of [[watercolour]] painting, both in the Canaries and Spain, of the last quarter of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Exposicionantologica"&gt;''Exposición antológica de Comas Quesada en el CICCA''. Magazine "Aguayro" nº 210, November/December 1994, p. 15. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic beginnings ==
[[File:Casa de Comas Quesada.jpg|thumb|left|180px|House where the painter lived.]]
Comas started in the art of painting at the early age of 15. His interest in it already exceled in the subject of drawing of the old high school, spending many hours to practice with pencil and charcoal. In those difficult times of the post-Civil Spanish War, his family did not consider painting a profession with future, as he explained in an interview: {{quote|“Entonces comencé peritaje mercantil, pero sin abandonar mi afición. Recuerdo que junto a varios amigos aprovechábamos los fines de semana para irnos con los caballetes en ristre a la zona de El Rincón o La Laja. La situación económica era tan mala que teníamos que hacernos nosotros mismos los caballetes preparando los lienzos con sacos de harina”.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Armas, ''“Comas Quesada, la magia de la acuarela”''. Daily Canarias 7, interview published the 16th December 1982, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His interest in watercolour, pictorial technique which he would not leave and would become a vehicle of expression for the rest of his life, began when he was between 18 or 20 years, while he was looking at a watercolours by Francisco Bonnín Guerín in the "Gabinete Literario" of Gran Canaria's capital, saying about them: {{quote|“Aquellas acuarelas de Bonnín eran algo asombroso, aún recuerdo un bodegón, que daba el perfume de las cosas, la limpieza de tratamiento. (…) Recuerdo que iba al estudio a hacer mis pinitos con la acuarela, luego volver a la exposición… o sea que para mí Bonnín indirectamente fue un maestro”.&lt;ref&gt;María Dolores Arroyo Fernández,'' La pintura contemporánea de paisaje en las Canarias orientales'' (doctoral thesis). University Complutense of Madrid, 1991, oral interview with the artist (1987) p. 662.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Lápida conmemorativa de Comas Quesada.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Commemorative plaque.]]
Watching at the paintings by Bonnín, Jose Comas learned the technique of watercolour indirectly, but about the style he felt more identified with that of Antonio González: {{quote|“Antonio González Suarez iba buscando lo que late, lo que se siente pero no se ve. Su paisaje de brumas y nieblas es también mi paisaje porque ese es mi sentimiento, las brumas, los días fríos.&lt;ref&gt;María Dolores Arroyo Fernández,'' La pintura contemporánea de paisaje en las Canarias orientales'' (doctoral thesis). University Complutense of Madrid, 1991, oral interview with the artist (1987) p. 666.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Due to the economic situation of the 1940s he could not afford a teacher, although this was not an obstacle to learn by himself, taking his first steps in the techniques of pencil, wax, [[sanguine]], [[oil]] and [[watercolour]]. He also practiced other artistic disciplines such as carving and [[sculpture]] modelling in [[clay]], [[plaster]] or [[plaster cast]], although his great hobby was always [[drawing]].

During this first stage of his artistic career, he participated in several collective exhibitions, such as the Club PALA (1947) where he presented four small-format watercolours, as well as during the exposition of new painters on the occasion of the awards "Nicolas Massieu", in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. He took part as well in the Biennial of Fine Arts of Las Palmas in 1950, 1952, 1958, 1960 and participated in the selection "Arti Grafiche Ricordi" (Milan, 1954).

After these first exhibitions he disappeared of the Canarian art scene for nearly twenty years because of family and work matters.

== Establishment as a watercolorist ==
[[File:Comas Quesada firma.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Painter's signature.]]
In 1974 he took up his true vocation, painting, and he became known in different art galleries of the moment. The unleashing that led to it was his work as representative of a company of moldings. At that time, the watercolourist felt like starting again and doubted on the artistic quality of these early pictures, hence he signed under the pseudonym of "Masca".&lt;ref name="María Dolores Arroyo Fernández, ''La pintura contemporánea de paisaje en las Canarias orientales'' (doctoral thesis) p. 663."&gt;María Dolores Arroyo Fernández, ''La pintura contemporánea de paisaje en las Canarias orientales'' (doctoral thesis). University Complutense of Madrid, 1991, p. 663.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 he began exhibiting with the "Agrupación de Acuarelistas Canarios" (Canarian Watercolour Association), first in the art gallery Cairasco in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and one year later at the Fine Arts Society in [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]. In 1976 he exhibited again in the above-mentioned Cairasco gallery, where he won the bronze medal of the Association for the watercolour entitled "Árboles y bruma" (Trees and mist).&lt;ref name="María Dolores Arroyo Fernández, ''La pintura contemporánea de paisaje en las Canarias orientales'' (doctoral thesis) p. 663."/&gt;

== Commemorative watercolours: "The painter of the city" ==
Special mention deserve the collections created between 1977 and 1981, where he executed, among others, several successive series of watercolours whose ''[[leitmotiv]]'' was about the different spots of Vegueta and Triana neighborhoods and that coincided in time with the 500 anniversary of the founding of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.

It was about evocative images of the old town, both contemporary to his time and retrospective of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in which were expressed the spirit of the historic town; intimate, impeccable and secluded places, deserted passages and alleys, churches, traditional Canarian balconies or [[kiosks]] witnesses of another era and time.

Some of the paintings reflected the city as it was in the late seventies, but the spaces which had been transformed or disappeared victims of progress, the artist turned to recreate them to his own memories and photographs from his personal archive. He knew how to capture with great sensitivity the environment and the atmosphere of yesteryear, leaving a documentary record for future generations, as no other painter of the time devoted to immortalize and portray the city to commemorate such an important event in the Canary Islands history.

Until the arrival of Comas Quesada, except for certain paintings by Nicolas Massieu, Felo Monzón, Jorge Oramas and a few more authors, Las Palmas was a city without painters who portray her.&lt;ref&gt;''Exposiciones en nuestras salas de arte''. Magazine "Aguayro" nº 118, December 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; And if Massieu is regarded as the painter of Gran Canaria, Comas Quesada is the painter of its capital city, because until then no other artist had produced so many works on it.

This is the reason why he is known as "the painter of the city",&lt;ref&gt;Alfredo Herrera Piqué, ''Pinturas de la vieja ciudad de Las Palmas''. Magazine "Aguayro" nº 102, August 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; he was a kind of historian, a "pictorial chronicler." For those pictures in particular, he sacrificed his usual technique by [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazes]] and a certain tendency to abstraction, by an absolute fidelity in drawing and approaching to the local colour,&lt;ref&gt;María Dolores Arroyo Fernández, ''La Pintura Contemporánea de paisaje en las Canarias Orientales'' (doctoral thesis). University Complutense of Madrid, 1991, p. 669.&lt;/ref&gt; moving us to bucolic and romantic scenes from the past, transmitting all the beauty and charm which every place irradiated and that only a master of watercolour as he was, knew how to grasp and understand.
The first of the collections came out in June 1977, when the artist presented in a folder 6 watercolours published in limited and numbered series,&lt;ref&gt;''Vegueta y Triana''. Magazine "Aguayro" nº 88, June 1977, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; in which were captured picturesque scenes from the founding neighborhoods of Vegueta and Triana.

A month later, on 4 July 1977,&lt;ref&gt;''Una nueva galería de arte en Las Palmas''. Magazine "Aguayro" nº 89, July 1977, pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; three years after his return to the art world and in his own words, without being totally convinced of the quality of his paintings,&lt;ref name="María Dolores Arroyo Fernández, ''La pintura contemporánea de paisaje en las Canarias orientales'' (doctoral thesis) p. 663."/&gt; he carried out his first solo exhibition. With it, was inaugurated the art gallery "Madelca", then located at Santa Ana main square in the Canary Islands' capital. It was a collection of 20 watercolours which depicted different parts of the old town, going ahead to the commemoration of the V Centenary of the founding of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria which was marked the next year. That year he won the contest of the late Cairasco gallery, receiving the silver medal by the "Agrupación de Acuarelistas Canarios" (Canarian Watercolorist Association) for the work "Bruma" (Mist),&lt;ref name="María Dolores Arroyo Fernández, ''La pintura contemporánea de paisaje en las Canarias orientales'' (doctoral thesis) p. 663."/&gt; as well as the award of "collection of work" by the Saving Bank of Gran Canaria.

In July 1978, he offered another solo exhibit at "Madelca" presenting again themes on the historic centre to mark the 500th Centenary of the constitution of his hometown, on this occasion the collection comprised 30 watercolours. In December he won the gold medal of the Canarian Watercolour Association Association, during the IV competition held at the Cairasco exposition gallery, for "Bruma" (Mist).&lt;ref&gt;María Dolores Arroyo Fernández, ''La Pintura Contemporánea de paisaje en las Canarias orientales'' (doctoral thesis). University Complutense of Madrid, 1991, p. 667.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, another series of watercolorus about the old quarter of Gran Canaria's capital entitled "Homenaje a la vieja Ciudad" (Homage to the old city). That same year he won the first prize for the painting called "Crepúsculo en el Sur" (Twilight in the South) at the First Biennial of Watercolour "Ciudad de Las Palmas".&lt;ref&gt;''1ª Bienal de la acuarela Ciudad de Las Palmas''. Magazine "Aguayro" nº 117, November 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the successful reception of the 1977, 1978 and 1979 series on the historic areas of Vegueta and Triana, these cityscapes are depicted again in some watercolors and prints in the Art Gallery of Gran Canaria Savings Bank, in December 1981. While not forgetting that he also created different collections with other landscape thematic during those years.

From 1981 he decided to bring to a close this thematic (although Las Palmas would be his "muse" for the last time in 1991), stating: {{quote|“Mi amor y mi entusiasmo por la ciudad y por Vegueta está suficientemente demostrado. He llevado a Vegueta durante muchos años fijo en mi mente, lo he pintado desde todas sus esquinas y ya la gente cuando ve por ahí una acuarela de la ciudad sabe si es mía o de otros pintores”.&lt;ref&gt;A. C., “''Comas Quesada un pintor para Vegueta''”. El Eco de Canarias, 25 de octubre de 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 1980s and early 90s he continued to participate in various individual and collective exhibitions, in several cultural centers and galleries of Gran Canaria, Tenerife and Fuerteventura.

In 1985 he became a member of the newly founded "Asociación Canaria de Acuarelistas" (Canarian Association of Watercolorists), also taking part in their expositions.

== Last phase: 1982-1992 ==
[[File:Monumento a Comas Quesada.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Comas Quesada memorial in his hometown.]]
In the last stage of his artistic career he broke with the illustrative and tried non-traditional compositions, he became more sober in colour and blend tonalities looking for a wider range of colours. This synthetic and suggestive line though not new, it is at this stage of creative maturity when it get a creative peak. As he stressed at the time: {{quote|“Me siento subyugado por los efectos neblinosos, por las brumas, las aguas encharcadas… atmósfera intemporal que produce efecto onírico. Es como si buscara en el paisaje que encanto hay detrás, en lo que no se ve, en ese misterioso más allá que no percibimos pero sí admiramos… sugiero una idea, elimino elementos que no me interesan, abstraigo de la realidad”.&lt;ref&gt;José M. Balbuena, “''Comas Quesada, el acuarelista de la abstracción sugerente''”. Interview published in the newspaper La Provincia, 4 December 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 1991, which would be the last exhibition held during his lifetime,&lt;ref name="Exposicionantologica" /&gt; presented a trilogy called: "La Vieja Ciudad" (The Old Town), "Rincones Isleños" (Island Spots) and "Espacios Abiertos" (Open Spaces). Regarding the first, the watercolorist recovered again the subject Las Palmas old quarter, but dealt with a renewed technique with an agile and vigorous brushwork, more decision in drawing and a greater chromaticism in his palette,&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Platero Fernández, ''Comas Quesada en el CICCA''. Magazine Aguayro nº 194, July/October 1991, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting he was a painter whose artistic expression was always in constant evolution and searching new ways of expression.

What characterizes and defines the pictorial production of Comas is a constant interest in both the traditional architecture and natural landscapes of the coasts, middlands and highlands of Gran Canaria, [[seascapes]], houses with tile roof, patios and balconies, and so on. Likewise, he also painted many of the most representative places of the island of [[Tenerife]], as well as some of [[Fuerteventura]].

The style of the watercolorist is completely identifiable, from the colour to the atmosphere, -that extraordinary use, but without exceeding, of the [[sfumato]]- everything has an emphasis in the area of the card: line and perspective, differentiation of plans, [[Wash (visual arts)|wash]] fluency, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Agustín Quevedo Pérez (art critic). Catalogue from the exhibition held in "El Corte Inglés", from 24 November to 12 December 1989, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a constant preference to reproduce certain effects and atmospheric elements that give many of his paintings a distinctive feature; fog, skies of various coloured clouds, water reflections, puddles, rainy days, etc. [[Seascape]]s where the form becomes evanescent, treatments of blue, white and golden exquisites which remind of one of the great masters of watercolour of all times, of [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;Paloma Herrero (art critic). Catalogue from the exhibition held in "El Corte Inglés", from 24 November to 12 December 1989, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined to the tenets of the so-called "experimental watercolour", name that opened two exhibitions in 1966 and 1971 respectively in La Laguna (Tenerife). This trend advocated for experimentation, surpassing the traditional molds that dominated the genre and offering a renewed vision in keeping with the style of the moment.&lt;ref&gt;María Dolores Arroyo Fernández,'' La pintura contemporánea de paisaje en las Canarias orientales''. University Complutense of Madrid, 1991, pp. 633-634.&lt;/ref&gt;

José Comas Quesada was a virtuoso of drawing, an impeccable master of the classic watercolour who knew how to reflect the light and the colour of the Canaries. According to his own words: {{quote|“He pintado con gusto y para mí es una satisfacción el dominio de la técnica. Pero no es pintar por pintar, hay que pintar con sentimiento, con el corazón, y hay que ser profesional”.&lt;ref&gt;María Dolores Arroyo Fernández, ''La pintura contemporánea de paisaje en las Canarias orientales''. University Complutense of Madrid, 1991, oral interview with the artist (1987) p. 672.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3230">This is a list of botanical illustrators and flower painters born in or citizens of the [[United States of America]]. It does not include European botanical illustrators active in America during the Colonial period; for information on these, see the main entry on [[botanical illustrator]]s.

Botanical illustrators paint or draw plants and sometimes their natural environment as well, forming a lineage where art and science meet. Some prefer to paint isolated specimen flowers while others prefer arrangements. Many botanical artists through the centuries have been active in collecting and cataloguing new species and/or in breeding plants. Some artists listed here worked primarily on botanical art, while others made it part of a wider artistic practice or illustrated books with their artwork.

&lt;!--Please do not add references for blue links, as the existence of their page is sufficient indication of notability for the purposes of this list. However, red links without at least one reference will be removed.--&gt;

'''Mary Parker''' (born 1930) is notable for being the first woman to appear on [[Melbourne]] television.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.cam.org.au/News-and-Events/Features/General-Features/Article/14780/Portrait-of-an-artist-Paul-Fitzgerald#.VSb_W_CK8y0 "Constant in Faith"], Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne bulletin, Vol. 24, Issue 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="televisionau.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://televisionau.com/classic-tv-guides/tv041156|title=Sunday 4 November 1956 – MELBOURNE|work=televisionau.com|accessdate=6 September 2015|date=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was one of three persons to host [[HSV (TV station)|HSV]] Channel 7's test broadcasts prior to their official opening night; the other two test broadscasters being [[Eric Pearce (broadcaster)|Eric Pearce (later Sir Eric Pearce)]] and Danny Webb. On HSV-7's opening night, 4 November 1956, Parker presented the news with Pearce.&lt;ref name="televisionau.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Listener In-TV'', 1 November 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this she had worked in England, where she became a well-known stage, screen and television actress.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2440489/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm|title=Mary Parker Biography|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Everybody in England knew Mary Parker", said her husband, [[Paul Fitzgerald (painter)|Paul Fitzgerald]]. "In England she did several films with Sir Douglas Fairbanks Jr – I've seen her name in lights on Shaftsbury Avenue and then she worked on TV as an announcer. They also brought her out to Australia in 1956 to open the (television coverage of the) Olympic Games – she was the first woman on television in (Melbourne)."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
Mary Parker was born on 31 October 1930 in [[Bitton, Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt; She grew up in Melbourne and attended [[Genazzano FCJ College|Genazzano Convent school]], returning to England to pursue her career until invited back to Melbourne by HSV-7 to be their initial female television personality.

==Family==
She married noted portrait artist [[Paul Fitzgerald (painter)|Paul Fitzgerald]] in 1957. They have seven children: Fabian (born 1959), Marisa (born 1960), Patrick (born 1963; now  deceased), Emma (born 1964), Edward (born 1968), Maria (born 1970) and Frances (born 1973). She lives in [[Melbourne]].

==British film career==
* ''[[The Vise]]'' [TV series] (''Kill Me My Love'' 1957, ''The Deception'' 1955, ''Gabriel's Choice'' 1954) ... Irene / Dorothy / Marianne Anderson (opposite fellow Australian [[Ron Randell]], [[Petula Clark]], [[Honor Blackman]] and [[Patrick McGoohan]])
* ''[[The Hostage (1956 film)|The Hostage]]'' (1956) ... Rosa Gonzuelo (lead female role opposite [[Ron Randell]])
* ''[[Colonel March of Scotland Yard]]'' [TV series] (1956) (''Present Tense'' 1957 ... Emily [opposite [[Boris Karloff]]])
* ''[[You Lucky People]]'' (1955) ...  Pvt. Sally Briggs (lead female role, opposite [[Tommy Trinder]] and [[Dora Bryan]])
* ''[[Third Party Risk]]'' (1954) ... Nancy (opposite [[Lloyd Bridges]] and [[Finlay Currie]])
* ''[[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents|Rheingold Theatre – Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents]]'' [TV series] (''The International Settlement'' 1954, ''The Trap'' 1954) ... Elizabeth / Peggy.

==Australian television career==
In the 1950s it was usual to have a host ''top and tail'' the various programs and Mary Parker had that role in the early days of HSV-7.

She also presented the following programs:
* ''[[Beauty is My Business]]'' 
* ''[[Eric and Mary]]'' (with [[Eric Pearce (broadcaster)|Eric Pearce]])
* ''[[Guest of the Week]]''
* ''[[The Judy Jack Show]]'' (covered when the regular hostess was indisposed)

In an interview with Parker in May 2015, she explained that she was also one of the first pianists on HSV-7, playing as preludes to a couple of her regular series of interviews. She started an interview with Des Bradley (violinist) by accompanying him in a rendition of [[Saint Saëns]]'s The Swan. Another interview was with [[Freddy Cole]] and started with a piano duet between Cole and Parker; this must have looked interesting to viewers because of the black and white hands on the keyboard.

Parker shares the honour of being among the first women on Australian television with [[Babs McKinnon]] the first woman on Sydney television when [[Nine Network|TCN-9]] was opened on 16 September 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcnchannel9.com/197149937|title=THE EARLY DAYS - www.tcnchannel9.com|work=SimpleSite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Melbourne, on HSV-7's opening night, singer [[Toni Lamond]] appeared in a variety program.&lt;ref name="televisionau.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The '''''Miracle of the Cross at the Bridge of S. Lorenzo''''' (Italian: ''Miracolo della Croce caduta nel canale di San Lorenzo'') is a painting by Italian Renaissance artist [[Gentile Bellini]], dating from 1500. It is now housed in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]] in [[Venice]].

==History==
[[File:Teleri della scuola di san giovanni ev., Gentile Bellini, Miracolo della Croce caduta nel canale di San Lorenzo (1500) 03.JPG|thumb|280px|Detail.]]
The painting was commissioned for the Grand Hall of the  [[Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista]], the seat of the eponymous brotherhood in Venice. The commission included a total of nine large canvasses, by prominent artists of the time such as Bellini, [[Perugino]], [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Giovanni Mansueti]], [[Lazzaro Bastiani]] and [[Benedetto Rusconi]]. 

The subject of the paintings were to be the miracles of a fragment of the [[True Cross]]. The item had been donated to the brotherhood by [[Philippe de Mézières]] (or Filippo Maser), chancellor of the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] and [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] in 1369, and soon became the object of veneration in the city.

The canvasses were all executed in 1496-1501. All survive today, aside from that by Perugino, and are now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia.

==Description==
The work portrays a miracle which took place during one of the yearly processions of the [[True Cross]] of the Scuola. The relic fell in the water: it subsequently escaped all the attempts of people to catch it, aside from that of Andrea Vendramin, the ''Gran Guardiano'' ("Grand Guardian") of the school.

The painting shows a meticulous  depiction of the ''canale'' and the bridge near which the reported miracle occurred, and of a number of people who assist to it. The recognizable characters include [[Caterina Cornaro]], queen of Cyprus. Some suppose she is among the kneeling women on the left; however, Catherine Cornaro is the first woman on the left (standing, with a girl to her left). She is praying. The group of gentlemen is perhaps that of Bellini's family, including his self-portrait and that of his brother [[Giovanni Bellini|Giovanni]].

At the centre is the Bridge of San Lorenzo ("St. Lawrence Bridge"), full of people who are looking at the event. The ''fondamente'' (the  roads which flank the Venetian channels) are also crowded, with some people coming on [[gondola]]s. Some people have dived and a woman, on the right, is pushing her moorish slave to do the same: however, Andrea Vendramin  has already grabbed the relic and is carrying it to the shore.

The buildings are painted with accurate colors, although with no [[geometrical perspective]]. Some of them feature the typical inverted cone chimneys of medieval Venice.

[[File:Praha Manes.jpg|thumb|right|The Manes building.]]

The '''Mánes Association of Fine Artists''' ({{Lang-cs|'''Spolek výtvarných umělců Mánes'''}} or '''''S.V.U.'''''; commonly abbreviated as ''Manes'') was an artists' association and exhibition society founded in 1887 in [[Prague]] and named after painter [[Josef Mánes]].

The Manes was significant for its international exhibitions before and after [[World War I]] that encouraged interaction between Czech artists and the foreign avant-garde. It played an important role in the development of [[Czech Cubism]] and Rondocubism. Between 1928 and 1930, Manes built a complex with a restaurant, club, showroom and offices at the site of the Štítkovský Mill and [[water tower]] on the [[Vltava]]. The architect of the 1928 Manes pavilion was member {{Interlanguage link multi|Otakar Novotný|cs}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceskapozice.cz/en/czech-living/arts-leisure/manes-restoration-aims-return-functionalist-gallery%E2%80%99s-former-glory Mánes restoration aims to return functionalist gallery’s former glory] by Ian Willoughby, czechposition.com, 12 January 2012. Retrieved 24 May 2013. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120114100139/http://www.ceskapozice.cz/en/czech-living/arts-leisure/manes-restoration-aims-return-functionalist-gallery%E2%80%99s-former-glory Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The union was liquidated under the Communists and was revived after the [[Velvet Revolution]] in 1990. Its headquarters became the Diamond House in Prague, itself a landmark of cubist architecture.

== Formative years (1885–1899) ==

''Svaz výtvarných umělců Mánes'' ("Association of Fine Artists Mánes") was established in 1887 as a group of [[Bohemia]]n artists in the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]]. Its forerunner was '''Škréta, spolek mladých českých výtvarníků v Mnichově''' ("Škréta, a Fellowship of Young Czech Artist in Munich"), an organization of Czech art students in [[Munich]], an art center largely visited by Central and Eastern European art students. The name of this society came from seventeenth century Bohemian painter [[Karel Škréta]]. Formed in 1885 it became one of the largest communities of Czech students abroad. It had its own infrastructure and annual show. It had regular contact with the homeland and published a journal in two parts: ''Paleta'' &amp; ''Špachtle'' ("Palette" and "Spatula"). This journal was circulated within the association only and all members had to contribute to it on weekly bases. Their focus was mainly on the German art scene. The group accepted other [[Slavic people|Slavic]] students as members.

The Škréta Fellowship renamed itself to ''Svaz výtvarných umělců Mánes'' ([[Abbreviation|abb.]] SVU Mánes), after painter J. Mánes, who lived and worked in the first half of the nineteenth century in [[Czech Lands]] and [[German Empire|Germany]], and who attended the [[Munich Art Academy]]. Many founding members of the ''Škréta'' moved to Prague in 1887 – probably due to reforms at the [[Prague Art Academy]] – and finished their studies there. The Škréta Fellowship continued until its members [[Alfons Mucha]] and [[Luděk Marold]] left Munich for [[Paris]].

Between 1885 and 1899 the focus was mainly on ''Palette'' and ''Spatula.'' ''Palette'' was a journal of art and literature and ''Spatula'' was a satirical magazine. These first fourteen years were the most important for the future development of modern Czech art scene. SVU Mánes took under its wings painting, sculpture and architecture. This notion was reflected in their emblem of three shields representing each the three art forms. The goals of SVU Mánes were mainly based on an old idea of patriotism with allegorical paintings from the Czech history, but they soon moved to modern art and its influx in Bohemia. One of the main differences from neighboring groups such as Munich and [[Viennese Secession]] was in their constant fight against [[pan-Germanism]]. One difference from [[Poles|Polish]] group ''Sztuka'' was in SVU Mánes’ openness to the international art scene.

== Infrastructure ==

SVU Mánes averaged some 300 members between 1887 and 1899. It was a large organization for the Prague environment and for a secessionist group. Its first elected president was painter and illustrator [[Mikoláš Aleš]], a (Aleš illustrated Old Czech manuscripts and was proclaimed by the critics as naïve, but SVU Mánes supported him and presented him with a diploma). Aleš, twenty years older than the rest of the members, had strong leadership and organization skills. Along with a sculptor, principal patron and chief organizer of SVU Mánes, [[Stanislav Sucharda]], they formed a strong lead. The editorial board was elected annually. The first most influential editors were painter Karel Vítězslav and painter and draughtsman [[Jan Preisler]]. Probably the most important role in SVU Mánes had {{Interlanguage link multi|František Xaver Šalda|cs}}, a journalist and an art critic.

== Evolution of secession in Prague ==

SVU Mánes rebelled against the old and rigid system of art exhibitions, art politics and pan-Germanism of art in Czech. Multiple events helped the patriotic SVU Mánes to achieve its success before their first exhibition in 1898.

* Jubilejní Výstava [[General Land Centennial Exhibition (1891)|Jubilee Exposition]] in Prague in 1891 included an art exhibition.
* In 1893 student political party Omladina [The Youth] was established looking for autonomy from the Empire.
* In 1893 Czech artists published a petition in general newspapers. They appealed to citizens to support Czech art by commissions and visitations of Czech art exhibitions.
* In 1895 the Manifest of Czech Modernism was published, signed mainly by writers and critics (including F. X. Šalda). It proclaimed neutrality in politics and humanist ideals. They were interested in Czech history, in feminist issues and individualism even in politics. Mánes was their great example.
* A book by [[Tomaš Garigue-Masaryk]] (future first president of [[Czechoslovakia]]) ''Česká otázka'' (Czech Question) whose focus was the nation’s evolution based on humanist principles, solution of social problems and [[anti-Semitism]]. Masaryk compared Czech history with the world’s historical evolution.
* The first Czech art exhibition in Topič salon produced a promotional poster by Viktor Oliva that was the first Bohemian poster exhibited internationally.
* In 1897, Rudolfínum (an equivalent to Parisian Salon) exhibited 950 works of art and received mocking reviews of a tasteless and overcrowded installation.
* In 1898 Czech language decrees (attempt to promote Czech as an equal language to German) reached their height with victory for Czechs. The Austrian government in Prague fell. The national celebration was visible in an annual exhibition of the German Art Union trying to exhibit a painting by [[Franz von Lenbach Theodor Mommsen]]. Mommsen was a German historian who the Czech public viewed as a great chauvinist. The reaction against this painting by the Czech audience caused the painting’s removal to protect it. This was followed by an appeal in newspapers for artists to leave the German Art Union and to boycott this show.
* In 1898, SVU Mánes exhibited its first group show.

== Important Exhibitions ==

=== 1897-98 ===

In 1897, SVU Mánes opened its first preliminary exhibition of competing posters. These were designed for its first exhibition the following year.

SVU Mánes' first exhibition was 5 February to 5 March in 1898 in Topič salon (a commercial gallery in the center) in Prague. With this exhibition, SVU Mánes proclaimed its secession. Thirty participants among the eighty members with landscapes dominating the show. The installation was similar to that in Rudolfínum, but many fewer works were selected.

On 3 November another exhibition was held in the same location, exhibiting fifty works from artists [[Joža Uprka]], František Bílek, [[Zdenka Braunerová]], [[Antonín Hudeček]] and [[Antonín Slavíček]]. With this exhibition, the members refused Rudolfínum as an exhibiting society, and stepped toward their own exhibiting building. This exhibition went up during the same time of preparation of the first exhibition of the Viennese Secession with which they had a competitive relationship. SVU Mánes show attracted members of Viennese society, who offered participation to Czech painters to exhibit in Vienna. František Bílek agreed, while Stanislav Sucharda refused absent an autonomous Czech show in Vienna.

=== 1899-1900 ===

In 1899, SVU Mánes began organizing traveling exhibitions in other towns of Bohemia and Moravia to increase public awareness.

In 1900 SVU Mánes exhibited in Viennese Künstlerhaus.

Also in 1900, SVU Mánes opened its third exhibition, showing sixty works in the Topič salon. KU Ministerium supported this show. It toured Brno and Vienna, getting more credit on its home soil as a competitor to Rudolfínum, but it brought new audiences and recognition in the international press. Among the exhibiting artists was [[Jan Preisler]] with his ''The Wind and Breeze'', František Bílek, who caused surprise and [[František Kupka]]. After this exhibition, Antonín Slavíček and Maxmilián Švabinský (''The Poor Country'') were invited to Miethke gallery in Vienna and Švabinský became the most exportable Bohemian artist. For the first time, SVU Mánes’ exhibition had a designer in architect Jan Kotěra who focused on simplicity and purity with respect to painting, sculpture and prints. This differed from the over-crowdedness of Rudolfínum and the over-ornamentation of the Viennese Secession. Sculptures were not for decoration but they were installed as autonomous art works.

=== 1902 ===

In 1902, SVU Mánes exhibited in Hagenbund, which became its frequent host.

After a visit to [[Paris Exposition of 1900]], Alfons Mucha and [[Josef Mařatka]] invited sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] to exhibit his works in Prague. This event took place in Manes’ new exhibiting building, the Mánes Pavilion in 1902, designed by [[Jan Kotěra]]. Kotěra took on an idea of Paradise with each sculpture displayed in its own space, not competing with the others, with floors covered with gravel and shrubs expanding the garden theme. This show utterly overshadowed Rudolfínum, making SVU Mánes the main exhibiting body in Bohemia. The exhibition also increased public interest in foreign art. Rodin influenced artists such as Sucharda, [[Ladislav Šaloun]] and [[Bohumil Kafka]]. This show had a political background of Czech intellectuals looking toward France, appealing to French republican artistic freedom. Rodin showed eighty sculptures and seventy drawings. His sculptures revealing intimate bodily details, sexuality and psychological expression, was new to Prague. He was taken as a genius by artists and critics, who appealed for Czech artists to follow his path by looking to themselves. This exhibition had a further impact on Austria and Germany. After Prague, Rodin took some of his pieces to Vienna. This show made Prague an international exhibiting city.

Following Rodin’s exhibition, SVU Mánes presented a retrospective of contemporary French painting the Nabis who Czech artists knew since the 1890s from their Parisian visits for their freedom of form and deliberate experiments.

Another exhibit presented works of Mikolaš Aleš, Hudeček and French graphic arts.

The year's last exhibition was a visiting show in Kraków hosted by Sztuka. Among the 132 Czech artists who exhibited there, belonged František Bílek, Sucharda, Kafka, Šaloun, Joža Úprka, Maxmilián Švabinský, Alois Kalvoda, Antonín Slavíček, František Kupka and others.

=== 1903 ===

A similar exhibition opened in 1903 in the Mánes Pavilion, surveying Czech art production, followed by a retrospective of Josef Mánes. He was the only non-contemporary artist exhibited in SVU Mánes.

An exhibition of Worpswede continued SVU Mánes’ interest in international art scene along with another show of Croatian contemporary art of Družstvo umjetnosti [Association of Art].

=== 1904 ===

Returning to the domestic art scene, SVU Mánes hosted a retrospective of Joža Úprka.

SVU Mánes members had their first group show in their new building, followed by a group show of Antonín Slavíček, Bohumil Kafka, Josef Mařatka, Stanislav Sucharda and Ladislav Šaloun.

=== 1905 ===

SVU Mánes presented an exhibition of [[Edvard Munch]].

Following Munch show was another group exhibition and after that an exhibition of T. F. Simon.

In the winter of 1905-06, SVU Mánes hosted Danish artists.

=== 1906-07 ===

1906 brought an exhibition of [[Nicholas Roerich|N. K. Roerich]] along with [[Francisco Goya]] and another member show.

The following year Henri le Sidaner together with Louis Dejean exhibited. After that, French Impressionism occupied the Mánes Pavilion.

Members and architects established Sdružení architektů Mánese [Association of Mánes’ Architects] that, a year later, began publishing its journal ''Styl'' [Style] concentrating on contemporary art and design.

At the turn of 1907 and 1908, English etchings arrived to Prague under the SVU Mánes’ umbrella.

=== 1908-10 ===

Auguste Rodin together with Ludwig v. Hofmann exhibited in 1908, followed by SVU Mánes’ group show.

Émile Bernard; E. A. Bourdelle; SVU Mánes’ group show came in 1909.

In 1910 SVU Mánes’ presented a group show of sketches: Les Independents; Slavíček; Axel Gellen-Kellela; Munch; and Swedish Art.

== Impact of Munch Show ==

When SVU Mánes presented Edvard Munch, the audience was shocked. This artist had an immense impact on the future development of modern art in Bohemia. No other show divided Czech artists as much. The artist community fell into two hostile camps. In 1907, eight art students formed "Osma" [The Eight], finding SVU Mánes too provincial. 

F. X. Šalda was the only critic who agreed with the new group. The main two members of Osma were Bohumil Kubišta and Emil Filla. Kubišta responded with ''Night of Love'' in 1908 and Filla with ''Reader of Dostoevsky'' in 1907. Jan Preisler was the only SVU Mánes member who responded to Munch with his painting ''Woman by a Lake'', however after harsh criticism he abandoned this style. Criticism of Preisler’s work angered Osma even more.

== 1912–1914: Cubist schism ==

In 1912, SVU Mánes split, following the [[Cubism|Cubist]] art scene in Paris: the Montmartre Cubism of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]], and [[Section d'Or]] Cubism led by [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Jean Metzinger]]. Prague's key followers of Montmartre Cubism in Prague were artists [[Emil Filla]] and [[Otto Gutfreund]], while the nucleus of the opposing camp was created around the Čapek brothers. Bohemian Cubists combined Cubism with [[Expressionism]], some with [[Futurism]], [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] and [[Rayonism]], while others concentrated on national or [[existentialism|existential]] subject matters. The artists influenced by Montmartre Cubism established Skupina výtvarných umelců [Group of Artists].

== ''Volné Směry'' journal ==

''Volné Směry'' (''Free Currents'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=cl&amp;cl=CL1&amp;sp=bmtnaan Volné Směry, available online: November 1896 - 1902 (61 issues), Blue Mountain Project]&lt;/ref&gt; was a journal of SVU Mánes first published in 1896. At first the association oriented its journal mainly toward literature, another driving force behind the Czech secessionist movement. Association members competed in its pages. The journal worked as a ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' [total work of art]. The editors also included information about international and domestic art scene and art criticism.

In 1902, installation designs began to appear. The journal competed mainly with Ver Sacrum of the Viennese Secession in content and form. At this point, its primary goal was promotion of Czech art along with introduction and commentary on the international art scene. Its funding came at first from members. The main editors were Vojtěch Preisler and Arnošt Hofbauer. ''Volné směry'' reached a wide public, with coverage better than its main competitor journal ''Moderní revue'' [Modern Review]. Other competing journals in Czech at the time were: ''L’Art'', ''L'Art et industrie'', ''Gazette des Beaux-Arts'', ''Revue des Arts Decoratifs'', ''La Plume'', ''L’ Art et les artistes'', ''The Art Amateur'', ''Art Journal'', ''Art Pictorial &amp; Industrial'', ''The Studio'', ''Formenschatz'', ''[[Dekorative Kunst]]'', ''Die Kunst'', ''Deutsche Kunst und Dekoration'', ''Kunst und Handwerk'', ''Skulpturenschatz'', ''Zeitschrift für Bildende Kunst'' and ''Die Graphischen Kunste''. In 1897, in its second volume, a special issue was dedicated to regionalist painter Úprka.

A year later, Kotěra published an essay to appeal to Czech citizens to think for themselves when looking at art and architecture. He stated that Czech art and architecture should be Czech, with Czech form, using local materials and technologies. Form should reflect modern times and should not mimic foreign art and architecture. Kotěra used a universal and pragmatic tone in his essay, without providing a definition of the Czech form. Open debates in ''Volné směry'' and other journals considered the planned destruction of Prague’s historical center.

In 1899, a special issue was dedicated to symbolist sculptor František Bílek. In the same year, Kotěra became one of the main editors and a professor of University of Architecture and Applied Arts in Prague. He studied directly under [[Otto Wagner]] in Vienna. At the turn of the century, a special issue devoted to the Third SVU Mánes exhibition was produced for the first time for Viennese audiences. The Rodin show was accompanied by a special double-issue dedicated to the sculptor in 1901, a year before its opening. By 1903, the journal established a comfortable position financially with approximately 1800 subscribing readers.

== Mánes Pavilion ==

In 1902 Kotěra designed the Mánes Pavilion for the Rodin exhibition. It was supposed to be only a temporary building, erected in four weeks. The pavilion was functional and flexible. Lit from the top, it had movable walls and Karel Špillar adorned it with a patriotic Slavic wooden lintel and allegorical mosaic. Manes used it until 1914. Its location was near the city center, close to a space where Prague officials wanted to build a modern gallery.

'''Sir Walter Newman Flower''' (8 July 1879 – 12 March 1964) was an English publisher and author. He transformed the fortunes of the publishing house [[Orion Publishing Group|Cassell &amp; Co]], and later became its proprietor. As an author, he published studies of the composers [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Franz Schubert]] and (as co-author) [[Arthur Sullivan]]. He also edited the million-word journals of [[Arnold Bennett]] for publication.

==Life and career==
Flower was born at [[Fontmell Magna]], [[Dorset]], England.  He was the eldest son of John Walter Flower.&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt; [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U51087 "Flower, Sir (Walter) Newman",] ''Who Was Who, 1920–2007'', A &amp; C Black, London; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 22 Nov 2008&lt;/ref&gt; After schooling at the [[Whitgift School]] he entered the publishing trade in London at the age of 17.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;&lt;ref name=times&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 13 March 1964, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Publishing===
Flower trained under [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]] at the Harmsworth Press, after which he joined [[Cassell Illustrated|Cassell &amp; Co]] in 1906. Cassell was at that time in the doldrums, but Flower built up a stable of magazine titles that grew to dominate the British magazine market for many years.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; In 1912 he was given charge of the book publishing branch of the company, where he brought in such authors as [[Arnold Bennett]], [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[H. G. Wells]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

In 1926, Cassell's magazines were sold to the Amalgamated Press, and Flower raised enough money to buy the book-publishing branch of the company, becoming proprietor and managing director in 1927. In 1938, shortly after receiving a [[knight]]hood for services to literature, he retired, but returned during [[World War II]] to look after the literary affairs of the company while his successor, his son Desmond, was on active service.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; Flower commissioned [[Winston Churchill]]'s ''[[A History of the English-Speaking Peoples]]'', which was eventually completed and published during the 1950s. During the war years, Churchill promised Flower that Cassell would be offered anything he later wrote about the war.  ''[[The Times]]'' described the result, Churchill's ''[[The Second World War (Churchill)|The Second World War]]'', as "perhaps the greatest coup of twentieth century publishing."&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

===Writing===
[[File:Bertie and arthur sullivan.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Herbert Sullivan (right) with his uncle [[Arthur Sullivan|Arthur]]]]
Flower was also an author. His life of [[George Frideric Handel]] was published in 1923 and reissued in a revised edition in 1959. The book was well received, but later writers on Handel have disputed Flower's portrait of Handel as "sexless and safe".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 June 1923, p. 10; and 7 March 1985, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Music &amp; Letters'', Vol. 29, No. 2, April 1948, pp. 177-79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Gary C. "'Was George Frideric Handel Gay?': On Closet Questions and Cultural Politics" in Brett, Philip, Elizabeth Wood, and Gary C. Thomas. ''Queering the Pitch: The New Gay and Lesbian Musicology''. New York: Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, Flower collaborated with [[Herbert Sullivan]] in a biography of the latter's uncle, ''Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]], his Life and Letters''. This too was well received at the time but also suffered later from critical disapproval for sanitising its subject by suppressing evidence of Sullivan's gambling and sexual liaisons.&lt;ref&gt;Sherr, Richard, ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', Vol. 38, No. 3, Autumn, 1985, pp. 637-43&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Flower published a study of [[Franz Schubert]], and in 1945 and 1950 he published two volumes of memoirs.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; His largest literary project was to prepare the journals of [[Arnold Bennett]] for publication – more than a million words in manuscript to be edited.  [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] later commented on "the prudish timidity of their editor, old Newman Flower. According to [[Hugh Walpole]], N. F. was so appalled by much of what he found in the journals that he published only brief extracts, and those the safest."&lt;ref&gt;Hart-Davis, Letter of 27 October 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
Flower was twice married, first in 1903 to Evelyne Readwin of [[Wells-next-the-Sea|Wells, Norfolk]], with whom he had one son, and second in 1943 to Bridget Downes of Coore, [[County Clare]], Ireland.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; He died at his home, Tarrant Keynston House, near [[Blandford]], Dorset, aged 84.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;

'''Pierre Marteau''' (French for ''Peter [[Hammer]]'') was the [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of a supposed [[publishing house]]. Allegedly located in [[Cologne]] from the 17th century onward, contemporaries were well-aware that such a publishing house never actually existed. Instead, the imprint was a fiction under which publishers and printers — in the Netherlands, France and Germany — evaded the open identification with books they published.

==History==
===Open pseudonym and political joke, spreading in the 1660s===
[[Image:Recveil-Marteau-1660.gif|thumb|180px|right|Probably the first Marteau-title: ''L'Histoire de Henry III'' (1660).]]
The first [[French language|French-language]] Marteau books appeared in the 1660s and were immediately identified as not actually being published by a man named Pierre Marteau residing in Cologne. The name would have been that of a Frenchman who had opened his shop outside France yet close to the French border. Cologne's geographical location smelled of political freedom — Marteau would avoid France's censorship by publishing outside France; Cologne promised access to the European market and the chance to get a good deal of the production smuggled back into France where it would sell on the black market for ten times the price.

French publishers, political dissidents and [[Huguenot]]s who had suffered political persecution under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] had opened their shops in [[Amsterdam]] and they would soon open new shops at [[The Hague]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Geneva]]. The [[Dutch Republic]] (a.k.a. the ''United Provinces'') and [[Switzerland]] protected Europe's [[Protestantism|Protestants]] of the [[reformed churches]], the minority among the three European confessions. These were the privileged countries French refugees tended to go.

[[Germany#The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (843–1806)|Germany]], a political entity of hundreds of little territories, half of them "Orthodox" [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Protestant]] half of them Catholic, which all together hardly ever united under the rule of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]], was only a third option. Some of the more liberal places like [[Hamburg]] ([[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] harboured sectarians and clandestine bookshops) and the university cities [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], [[Leipzig]] and [[Jena]] offered freedoms to critical intellectuals, yet only a few states like [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] openly sympathised with the reformed branch of Protestantism to which France's Huguenots belonged. Germany was a choice with disadvantages. Cologne, however, was of all the options Germany granted the worst, which was to become apparent at the beginning of the 18th century when most of Germany's territories joined the Dutch Republic and [[Great Britain]] against France in the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Great Alliance]] of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. The two [[Wittelsbach]]-ruled countries — Cologne and [[Bavaria]] — were the only important western European territories that supported Louis XIV.

The first Marteau books were French and most certainly printed in Amsterdam by publishers who would not risk to tell their names even in the Netherlands. Research has hinted at Amsterdam publisher [[Elzevier]] as the man who invented the imprint. It was, at first, just one among many openly misleading imprints. Unlike the usual obvious pseudonyms like "Jacques le Sincere", the name "Pierre Marteau" sounded real. The detail which gave away his virtuality remained on the reader's side — he would identify Cologne as the likely and yet unlikely place to go. "Hammer" made the joke a little bit more explicit: this man had courage and he was as real and as bold as a hammer.

Unlike other pseudonyms which appeared on only one title page, Marteau was to have a career that could be made only by a good joke and a complete lack of [[intellectual property rights]]. Numerous publishers began to sell books under the label. Remarkably, the uncoordinated joint venture was nonetheless able to produce a distinct publisher's identity. Only certain books attracted the imprint: French yet anti-French political satire, pirated editions, sexually explicit titles.

===German Marteau books and the European decades between 1689 and 1721===
[[Image:Historical profile of German Marteau-production.gif|thumb|left|Historical Profile of the German Marteau production, books per year]]
A second branch of Marteau books developed in the late 1680s when [[German language|German-language]] titles first assumed the curious imprint. 1689 became a landmark year, the year of the [[Glorious Revolution]] which had brought a Dutch regent onto the English throne. [[William III of England|William of Orange]], who had led the Dutch resistance against France in the 1670s, became William III of England, Scotland and Wales. Whilst France protected the deposed [[James II of England|Stuart Pretender]], William was particularly keen to move both the Netherlands and his newly acquired Britain into an anti-French alliance on Germany's behalf — Louis XIV had just attacked the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]; the [[Nine Years' War]] began —, the first phase of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Great Alliance]], a period German intellectuals would soon praise as the beginning of a thoroughly European age. German intellectuals had always admired France's intellectuals and the latest Parisian fashions, yet they had also felt uneasy about their love of France. Germany's critical voices complained, as they considered their own leanings towards France, that Germany had not produced any authentic German culture.

In the 1680s things changed. All of a sudden, one could be a German patriot and openly embrace French culture — if only one stressed the fact that France's intellectuals were by now mostly critical of their own country's political repression and ambition. French dissidents published political journals, newspapers and books outside France on the international market. Germans bought and imitated them after the events of 1689 without the slightest feeling of national disloyalty. The new French authors propagated the very Europe which had come to Germany's assistance. The Great Alliance against France was produced and supported by the French press of the Netherlands. Marteau was the publisher of the Great Alliance and the new modern Europe fighting France, the hegemonic power striving for a "universal monarchy" over all its neighbours. The Marteau label became fashionable, and German publishers adopted it: it flourished, with translations of French Marteau books and with original German titles now appearing under the labels of Marteau, his Widow, his Son, and a growing line of virtual family members continuing the business.

The peaks of the German Marteau production coincide with the political events Marteau covered. The beginning of the Great Alliance in 1689, its renewal on the eve of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1701, its end in a [[Tory]] victory in London 1709/10 and the succeeding [[Treaty of Utrecht|peace negotiations at Utrecht]], kept Marteau's political authors busy.

Europe turned out to be unreliable. English Tory politicians crafted the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which favored France's aspirations even though France had nearly lost the recent war. German intellectuals were unhappy with Europe, yet they still had to trust in Europe and to promote the European idea if [[Hanover]]'s King [[George I of Great Britain|George]] was to continue his aspirations to the English throne. He crossed the [[English Channel|Channel]] in 1714 and had to survive a phase of political turmoil in 1715 and 1716 — covered by Marteau with all the old anti-French political bias: France promoted the Stuart Pretender in his fight against the newly established German King. The Great Alliance gave way to the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance]] of 1718-1720 in which Austria, France, Great Britain, and the United Provinces joined their forces to resolve the next European conflict. The fate of Europe remained on the political agenda until 1721, with the other half of Europe fighting the [[Great Northern War]]. The conflict about [[Sweden]]'s and [[Russia]]'s future power had begun in 1700 and involved northern and eastern Europe from [[Stockholm]] to [[Constantinople]]. It ended in 1721 and brought the European period of 1689-1721 to a silent end.

[[Image:La France Galante 1696.gif|thumb|Entertainment and politics: ''La France Galante'' (1696).]] 
Political books dominated Marteau's production. The peculiar ''Memoires pour rendre la paix perpetuelle en Europe'' appeared at one of Marteau's rivals in Cologne: Jacques le Pacifique published their first volume in 1712 ([[Immanuel Kant]] would refer to the outline of a union of European states at the end of the century in his famous treatise on a permanent world peace). Politics could hardly be separated from entertainment. [[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer]] published her political gossip under the ubiquitous label. The secrets of the diplomats negotiating at Utrecht were a bestseller. Political novels like ''La Guerre d'Espagne'' (Cologne: Pierre Marteau, 1707) were extremely influential — the book mixed fact and fiction, sections of newspaper history with personal adventures of its hero, a virtual [[James Bond]] in the services of Louis XIV.

Satirical novels written by students in Halle, Leipzig and Jena claimed to be printed in Cologne. A pirated edition of the first German translation of ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' appeared under the imprint. The mixing of fact and fiction, information and entertainment, intellectual theft and scandal — the only possible answer to the censorship laws flourishing all over Europe — marked the Marteau production between 1660 and 1721.

===European publisher and German national icon===
A third phase of the Marteau production began after the European decades of 1689-1721 with the nationalistic turn of the 1720s and 1730s. Marteau's German production became pro-German and potentially anti-French, finding its peaks in the years of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

The 20th and 21st centuries saw only very few new Marteau publications, with the [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Peter Hammer Verlag in [[Wuppertal]]. The old publishing house's modern web-presence at pierre-marteau.com remains a virtual enterprise led by historians of the 18th century who use the label as a well established brand name to publish texts of the period 1650-1750 and research dealing with that period. {{third-party inline|date=March 2016}}

'''Postdigital,''' in artistic practice, is an attitude that is more concerned with being human, than with being digital. Postdigital is concerned with our rapidly changed and changing relationships with digital technologies and art forms. If one examines the textual paradigm of consensus, one is faced with a choice: either the "postdigital" society has intrinsic meaning, or it is contextualised into a paradigm of consensus that includes art as a totality. 

== Theory ==


[[Giorgio Agamben]] (2002) describes paradigms as things what we think with, rather than things we think about. Like the computer age, the postdigital is also a paradigm, but as with post-humanism for example, an understanding of postdigital does not aim to describe a life ''after'' digital, but rather attempts to describe the present-day opportunity to explore the consequences of the digital and of the computer age. While the computer age has enhanced human capacity with inviting and uncanny prosthetics, the postdigital may provide a paradigm with which it is possible to examine and understand this enhancement.

In ''The Future of Art in a Postdigital Age'' [[Mel Alexenberg]] defines "postdigital art" as artworks that address the humanization of digital technologies through interplay between digital, biological, cultural, and spiritual systems, between cyberspace and real space, between embodied media and mixed reality in social and physical communication, between high tech and high touch experiences, between visual, haptic, auditory, and kinesthetic media experiences, between virtual and augmented reality, between roots and globalization, between autoethnography and community narrative, and between web-enabled peer-produced wikiart and artworks created with alternative media through participation, interaction, and collaboration in which the role of the artist is redefined.

In addition to the wide scope of artistic discourse, the notion of postdigital is emerging as a term that describes the exploration of our relationship to the computer age as a dominant paradigm in a time of global mixing, intertwined economies, population certainty and planetary limits, for example in the work of Berry (2014).

[[Roy Ascott]] has  demonstrated that the distinction between the digital and the "postdigital" is part of the economy of reality.

== Music ==

[[Kim Cascone]] uses the term in his article ''The Aesthetics of Failure: "Post-digital" Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music.''&lt;ref name=Cascone1&gt;{{cite web|title=THE AESTHETICS OF FAILURE 'Post-Digital' Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/journals/COMJ/CMJ24_4Cascone.pdf|work=''Computer Music Journal,'' 24:4 Winter 2002 (MIT Press)|first=Kim |last=Cascone |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He begins the article with a quotation from MIT Media Lab cyberpundit [[Nicholas Negroponte]]: "The [[digital revolution]] is over." Cascone goes on to describe what he sees as a 'post-digital' line of flight in the music also commonly known as glitch or microsound music, observing that 'with [[electronic commerce]] now a natural part of the business fabric of the Western world and Hollywood cranking out digital fluff by the gigabyte, the medium of digital technology holds less fascination for composers in and of itself.'

In ''Art after Technology'' [[Maurice Benayoun]] lists possible tracks for "postdigital" art considering that the digital flooding has altered the entire social, economical, artistic landscape and the artist posture will move in ways that try to escape the technological realm without being able to completely discard it. From lowtech to biotech and ''critical fusion'' - critical intrusion of fiction inside reality – new forms of art emerge from the digital era.

The '''processing fluency theory of aesthetic pleasure'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0804_3|pmid=15582859|title=Processing Fluency and Aesthetic Pleasure: Is Beauty in the Perceiver's Processing Experience?|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|volume=8|issue=4|pages=364–382|year=2004|last1=Reber|first1=Rolf|last2=Schwarz|first2=Norbert|last3=Winkielman|first3=Piotr}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a theory in [[psychological aesthetics]] on how people experience [[beauty]]. [[Processing fluency]] is the ease with which information is processed in the human mind.

==Overview==
The [[theory]] is based on four basic assumptions:

#Objects differ in the fluency with which they can be processed. Variables that facilitate fluent processing include objective features of [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]], like [[Principles of grouping#Good Form|goodness of form]], [[Gestalt psychology#Pr.C3.A4gnanz|symmetry]], [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure-ground contrast]], as well as experience with a stimulus, like [[Mere-exposure effect|repeated exposure]] or prototypicality. 
#Processing fluency is itself hedonically marked (that is, it possesses an inherent [[Affective|affective quality]]) and high fluency is subjectively experienced as positive.&lt;ref&gt;Winkielman, P., Schwarz, N., Fazendeiro, T., &amp; Reber, R. (2003). The hedonic marking of processing fluency: Implications for evaluative judgment. In J. Musch &amp; K. C. Klauer (Eds.), ''The Psychology of Evaluation: Affective Processes in Cognition and Emotion''. (pp. 189-217). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#In line with the "feelings-as-information" account,&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, N., &amp; Clore, G. L. (2007). Feelings and phenomenal experiences. In E. T. Higgins &amp; A. W. Kruglanski (Eds.), ''Social Psychology: Handbook of basic principles'' (2nd ed., pp. 385-407). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; processing fluency feeds into judgments of aesthetic appreciation because people draw on their subjective experience in making evaluative judgments, unless the informational value of the experience is called into question. 
#The impact of fluency is moderated by expectations and [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]]. On one hand, fluency has a particularly strong impact on affective experience if there are no expectations (that is, its source is unknown and fluent processing comes as a surprise). On the other hand, the fluency-based affective experience is discounted as a source of relevant information when the perceiver attributes the experience to an irrelevant source. This helps explain the inverted U-shaped function often found in research on the effect of complexity on preferences:&lt;ref&gt;Berlyne, D. E. (1971). ''Aesthetics and psychobiology''. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; very complex patterns are not judged as beautiful because they are disfluent, and patterns are judged as more beautiful when they become less complex. When viewers perceive a simple pattern, they are often able to detect the source of fluency—the pattern's simplicity—and do not use this experience of ease for judging the beauty of the pattern.

The processing fluency theory of aesthetic pleasure emphasizes the interaction between the viewer and an object in that it integrates theories and a wide range of [[empirical evidence]] that focus on effects of objective stimulus attributes on perceived beauty&lt;ref&gt;[[George David Birkhoff|Birkhoff, G. D.]] (1933). ''Aesthetic measure''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with those that emphasize the role of experience, for example by invoking prototypicality.&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C., &amp; Moore, K. (1988). Priming, prototypicality, and preference. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance'', ''14'', 661–670.&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, beauty is seen as an experience that has nothing to do with artistic merit: Beautiful works of art may be without any merit whereas good art is not necessarily beautiful.

The theory resolves the apparent paradox of [[Nature versus nurture|inborn and acquired preferences]]. For instance, infants prefer consonant melodies. According to the fluency account, this is because infants share perceptual equipment that make them process consonance in music more easily than dissonance. When children grow up, they are exposed to the music of their culture, resulting in culture-specific musical fluency. This familiarization explains why individuals from different cultures have different musical tastes. In addition, the theory helps explain why beauty (in a wide sense; perhaps the term ''elegance'' is more apt) is a cue for truth in mathematical problem solving and scientific discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, N. (2006). On judgments of truth &amp; beauty. ''Daedalus'', ''135'', 136–138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3758/PBR.15.6.1174|title=The use of heuristics in intuitive mathematical judgment|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=15|issue=6|pages=1174–1178|year=2008|last1=Reber|first1=Rolf|last2=Brun|first2=Morten|last3=Mitterndorfer|first3=Karoline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As rights vary by country and jurisdiction, a work may be subject to rights in one country and be in the public domain in another. Some rights depend on registrations on a country-by-country basis, and the absence of registration in a particular country, if required, gives rise to public-domain status for a work in that country. The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the "[[public sphere]]" or "[[commons]]", including concepts such as the "commons of the mind", the "intellectual commons", and the "information commons".&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 103" /&gt;

==History==
Although the term "domain" did not come into use until the mid-18th century, the concept "can be traced back to the ancient [[Roman law|Roman Law]], as a preset system included in the property right system."&lt;ref name="Haung"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=H.|title=On public domain in copyright law| journal=Frontiers of Law in China| year=2009| volume=4| issue=2| pages=178–195| doi=10.1007/s11463-009-0011-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans had a large proprietary rights system where they defined "many things that cannot be privately owned"&lt;ref name="Haung"/&gt; as ''[[res nullius]]'', ''[[Res communis|res communes]]'', ''[[Res publica|res publicae]]'' and ''res universitatis''. The term ''res nullius'' was defined as things not yet appropriated.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, C Romans, Roads, and Romantic Creators: Traditions of Public Property in the Information Age (Winter 2003) Law and Contemporary Problems 89 at p.5, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''res communes'' was defined as "things that could be commonly enjoyed by mankind, such as air, sunlight and ocean."&lt;ref name="Haung"/&gt; The term ''res publicae'' referred to things that were shared by all citizens, and the term ''res universitatis'' meant things that were owned by the municipalities of Rome.&lt;ref name="Haung"/&gt; When looking at it from a historical perspective, one could say the construction of the idea of "public domain" sprouted from the concepts of ''res communes'', ''res publicae'', and ''res universitatis'' in early Roman law.&lt;ref name="Haung"/&gt;

When the first early copyright law was first established in Britain with the [[Statute of Anne]] in 1710, public domain did not appear. However, similar concepts were developed by British and French jurists in the 18th century. Instead of "public domain", they used terms such as ''[[publici juris]]'' or ''propriété publique'' to describe works that were not covered by copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Torremans| first = Paul| title = Copyright law: a handbook of contemporary research| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2007| pages = 134–135| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wHJBemWuPT4C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22| isbn = 978-1-84542-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "fall in the public domain" can be traced to mid-19th century France to describe the end of [[copyright term]]. The French poet [[Alfred de Vigny]] equated the expiration of copyright with a work falling "into the sink hole of  public domain"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Torremans| first = Paul| title = Copyright law: a handbook of contemporary research| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2007| page = 154| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wHJBemWuPT4C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22| isbn = 978-1-84542-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if the public domain receives any attention from intellectual property lawyers it is still treated as little more than that which is left when intellectual property rights, such as [[copyright]], [[patents]], and, expire or are abandoned.&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 103"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ronan |first=Deazley |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2006 |page=103 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute%20of%20anne%20copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate=19 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this historical context Paul Torremans describes copyright as a, "little coral reef of private right jutting up from the ocean of the public domain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Torremans| first = Paul| title = Copyright law: a handbook of contemporary research| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2007| page = 137| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wHJBemWuPT4C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22| isbn = 978-1-84542-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright law differs by country, and the American legal scholar [[Pamela Samuelson]] has described the public domain as being "different sizes at different times in different countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ronan |first=Deazley |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2006 |page=102 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute%20of%20anne%20copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate=19 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[File:NewtonsPrincipia.jpg|thumb|[[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] own copy of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', with hand-written corrections for the second edition]]

Definitions of the boundaries of the public domain in relation to copyright, or intellectual property more generally, regard the public domain as a negative space; that is, it consists of works that are no longer in copyright term or were never protected by copyright law.&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 104"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ronan |first=Deazley |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2006 |page=104 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute%20of%20anne%20copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate=19 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]] this definition underlines common usage of the term ''public domain'' and equates the public domain to [[public property]] and works in copyright to [[private property]]. However, the usage of the term ''public domain'' can be more granular, including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by [[copyright exceptions]]. Such a definition regards work in copyright as private property subject to [[fair use|fair-use]] rights and limitation on ownership.&lt;ref name="Boyle 2008 38"/&gt; A conceptual definition comes from Lange, who focused on what the public domain should be: "it should be a place of sanctuary for individual creative expression, a sanctuary conferring affirmative protection against the forces of private appropriation that threatened such expression".&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 104"/&gt; Patterson and Lindberg described the public domain not as a "territory", but rather as a concept: "[T]here are certain materials – the air we breathe, sunlight, rain, space, life, creations, thoughts, feelings, ideas, words, numbers – not subject to private ownership. The materials that compose our cultural heritage must be free for all living to use no less than matter necessary for biological survival."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ronan |first=Deazley |title=Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |year=2006 |page=105 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-1-84542-282-0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119042246/https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute%20of%20anne%20copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |archivedate=19 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the "[[public sphere]]" or "[[commons]]", including concepts such as the "commons of the mind", the "intellectual commons", and the "information commons".&lt;ref name="Ronan 2006 103"/&gt;

==Public domain by medium==

=== Public domain books ===
A public-domain book is a book with no copyright, a book that was created without a license, or a book where its copyrights expired&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fn1Pl9Gv_EMC&amp;dq=public%20domain&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind|first=James|last=Boyle|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Yale University Press|accessdate=30 December 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; or have been forfeited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gK6OI0hrANsC&amp;dq=%22public%20domain%22%20intellectual%20property&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Intellectual Property and Traditional Cultural Expressions in a Digital Environment|first1=Christoph Beat|last1=Graber|first2=Mira Burri|last2=Nenova|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|accessdate=30 December 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In most countries the [[List of countries' copyright lengths|term of protection]] of copyright lasts until January first, 70 years after the death of the latest living author. The longest copyright term is in Mexico, which has life plus 100 years for all deaths since July 1928.

A notable exception is the United States, where every book and tale written prior to 1923 is in the public domain; American copyrights last for 95 years for books written between 1923 and 1978.

For example: the works of [[Jane Austen]], [[Lewis Carroll]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] are in the public domain worldwide as they all died over one hundred years ago.

[[Project Gutenberg]] makes tens of thousands of public domain books available online as [[ebook]]s.

===Public domain music===
{{Main article|Public domain music}}
People have been creating music for millennia. The first [[musical notation]] system, the [[Music of Mesopotamia]] system, was created 4000 years ago. [[Guido of Arezzo]] introduced Latin musical notation in the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This laid the foundation for the preservation of global music in the public domain, a distinction formalized alongside copyright systems in the 17th Century. Musicians copyrighted their publications of musical notation as literary writings, but performing copyrighted pieces and creating derivative works were not restricted by early copyright laws. Copying was widespread, in compliance with the law, but expansions of those laws intended to benefit literary works and responding to commercial music recording technology's reproducability have lead to stricter rules. Relatively recently, a normative view that copying in music is not desirable and lazy has become popular among professional musicians.

U.S. copyright laws distinguish between musical compositions and sound recordings, the former of which refers to melody, notation and/or lyrics created by a composer and/or lyricist, including sheet music, and the latter referring to a recording performed by an artist, including a CD, LP, or digital sound file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ56a.pdf|title=Copyright Registration of Musical Compositions and Sound Recordings|publisher=United States Copyright Office|format=pdf|accessdate=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musical compositions fall under the same general rules as other works, and anything published prior to 1922 is considered public domain. Sound recordings, on the other hand, are subject to different rules and are not eligible for public domain status until 2049-2067, depending on the date and location of publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain |title= Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States |publisher=Cornell University |accessdate= October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Musopen]] project records music in the public domain for the purposes of making the music available to the general public in a high-quality audio format. Online musical archives preserve collections of classical music recorded by Musopen and offer them for download/distribution as a public service.

===Public domain films===
{{Main article|Public domain film}}
A '''public-domain film''' is a [[film]] that was released to public domain by its author or because its [[copyright]] has expired. In 2016 there are more than 2,000 films on public domain in every genre, from musicals to romance, horror to animated movies and noir to western movies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

''The Guinness Book of Records 1999'', Bantam Books, 358; Voigts-Virchow, Eckartm (2004), ''Janespotting and Beyond: British Heritage Retrovisions Since the Mid-1990s'', Gunter Narr Verlag, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to straightforward adaptation, they have been used as the launching point for transformative retellings such as [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' and [[Troma Entertainment]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.&lt;ref name="Homan2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Homan |first=Sidney |title= Directing Shakespeare: a scholar onstage |url= https://books.google.com/?id=EM0n1ueBa_sC&amp;pg=PT101 |accessdate=1 June 2010 |year=2004 |publisher= Ohio University Press |isbn=978-0-8214-1550-4 |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kossak2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kossak |first=Saskia |title= "Frame my face to all occasions": Shakespeare's Richard III on screen |url= https://books.google.com/?id=-PNZAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=1 June 2010 |year=2005 |publisher=Braumüller |isbn=978-3-7003-1492-9 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CartmellWhelehan2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cartmell |first1=Deborah |author2= Imelda Whelehan |title=The Cambridge companion to literature on screen |url= https://books.google.com/?id=fhJNFc1f0DAC&amp;pg=PA69 |accessdate=1 June 2010 |year=2007 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-61486-3|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcel Duchamp's ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]'' is a derivative of Leonardo da Vinci's ''Mona Lisa'', one of thousands of derivative works based on the public domain painting.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;

==Perpetual copyright==
{{Main article|Perpetual copyright}}
Some works may never fully lapse into the public domain. A perpetual [[crown copyright]] is held for the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the Bible in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruce M. |last=Metzger |title=The Oxford companion to the Bible|year=2006 |publisher= Oxford Univ. Press |location= Oxford |isbn=978-0-1950-46458 |pages=618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the copyright has expired for the Peter Pan works by [[J. M. Barrie]] (the play ''[[Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]''  and the novel ''Peter and Wendy'') in the United Kingdom, it was granted a special exception under the Copyright, Designs, and Patents Act 1988 (Schedule 6)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_28.htm |title=Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (c. 48) |work=Office of Public Sector Information |year=1988 |page=28 |accessdate=2 September 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601225021/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_28.htm |archivedate=1 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that requires royalties to be paid for commercial performances, publications and broadcasts of the story of Peter Pan within the UK, as long as [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] (to whom Barrie gave the copyright) continues to exist.

In a [[paying public domain]] regime, works that have entered the public domain after their copyright has expired, or traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions that have never been subject to copyright, are still subject to royalties payable to the state or to an authors' association. The user does not have to seek permission to copy, present or perform the work, but does have to pay the fee. Typically the royalties are directed to support of living artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |date=24 November 2010 |publisher=Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore: Seventeenth Session

== Public domain mark ==
{{Main article|Public Domain Mark}}
[[File:Cc-public_domain_mark_white.svg |thumb |150px|[[Creative Commons]]' [[Public Domain Mark]]]]
The [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] proposed in 2010 the ''[[Public Domain Mark]]'' (PDM) as [[symbol]] to indicate that a work is free of known [[copyright]] restrictions and therefore in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Creative-Commons-announces-the-Public-Domain-Mark-1106052.html |title= Creative Commons announces the Public Domain Mark |publisher=[[The H]] |work=The H Open |accessdate=12 October 2010 |date=12 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101016044229/http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Creative-Commons-announces-the-Public-Domain-Mark-1106052.html |archivedate= 16 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/23830 |title= Improving Access to the Public Domain: the Public Domain Mark |publisher= Creative Commons |author=Diane Peters |accessdate=12 October 2010 |date=11 October 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014022853/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/23830 |archivedate= 14 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The public domain mark is analogous to the [[copyright symbol]], which acts as [[copyright notice]]. The [[Europeana]] databases use it, and for instance on the [[Wikimedia Commons]] in February 2016 2.9 million works (~10% of all works) are listed as ''PDM''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:CC-PD-Mark Category:CC-PD-Mark ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312115401/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category%3ACC-PD-Mark |date=12 March 2016 }} in February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to copyrightable works==

===Works not covered by copyright law===
The underlying idea that is expressed or manifested in the creation of a work generally cannot be the subject of copyright law (see [[idea–expression divide]]). Mathematical formulae will therefore generally form part of the public domain, to the extent that their expression in the form of software is not covered by copyright.

Works created before the existence of copyright and patent laws also form part of the public domain.  For example, [[the Bible]] and the inventions of [[Archimedes]] are in the public domain. However, translations or new formulations of these works may be copyrighted in themselves.

===Expiry of copyright===
Determination of whether a copyright has expired depends on an examination of the copyright in its source country.

In the United States, determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex, primarily because [[copyright term]]s have been extended multiple times and in different ways—shifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with [[copyright renewal|a possible renewal term]], to a term extending to 50, then 70, years after the death of the author.  The claim that "pre-1923 works are in the public domain" is correct only for published works; unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus 70 years.

In most other countries that are signatories to the [[Berne Convention]], copyright term is based on the life of the author, and extends to 50 or 70 years beyond the death of the author. (See [[List of countries' copyright lengths]].)

Legal traditions differ on whether a work in the public domain can have its copyright restored. In the European Union, the [[Copyright Duration Directive]] was applied retroactively, restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain.  Term extensions by the U.S. and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain, but rather delayed the addition of works to it. However, the United States moved away from that tradition with the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]], which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based [[copyright formalities |formalities requirements]].  Consequently, in the US, foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently, with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of compliance with formalities, while domestically-sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirements—a situation described as odd by some scholars, and unfair by some US-based rightsholders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis Karjala]], "Judicial Oversight of Copyright Legislation", 35 N. Ky. L. Rev. 253 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government works===
[[Work of the United States Government|Works of the United States Government]] and various other governments are excluded from copyright law and may therefore be considered to be in the public domain in their respective countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf Copyright Office Basics] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225235545/http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf |date=25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be in the public domain in other countries as well. The legal scholar Melville Nimmer has written that "it is axiomatic that material in the public domain is not protected by copyright, even when incorporated into a copyrighted work".&lt;ref&gt;[[Melville Nimmer |Nimmer, Melville B.]], and David Nimmer (1997). ''[[Nimmer on Copyright]]'', section 13.03(F)(4). Albany: Matthew Bender.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dedicating works to the public domain===

==== Release without copyright notice ====
Before 1988 in the US, works could be easily given into the public domain by just releasing it without an explicit [[Copyright notice]]. With the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] Implementation Act of 1988 (and the earlier [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which went into effect in 1978), all works were by default copyright protected and needed to be actively given into public domain by a [[waiver]] statement/[[anti-copyright notice|anti-copyright can call notice]].&lt;ref name="cornelledu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm |title=Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States |publisher= |accessdate= 30 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926203654/http://www.copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm |archivedate=26 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="copyrightgov"&gt;''[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf Copyright Notice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926110554/http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf |date=26 September 2012 }}'', U.S. Copyright Office Circular 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all legal systems have processes for reliably donating works to the public domain, e.g. [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of [[continental Europe]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} This may even "effectively prohibit any attempt by copyright owners to surrender rights automatically conferred by law, particularly [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]]".&lt;ref name="aboutcc0"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0 |title= About CC0 — "No Rights Reserved" |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate= 23 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130428010038/http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0 |archivedate= 28 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Public-domain-like licenses ====
{{main article|Public domain equivalent license}}
An alternative is for copyright holders to issue a licence which irrevocably grants as many rights as possible to the general public. Real public domain makes [[license]]s unnecessary, as no owner/author is required to grant permission ("[[Permission culture]]"). There are multiple licenses which aim to release works into the public domain. In 2000 the [[WTFPL]] was released as a public domain like [[software license]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130602181949/http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-wmaker/trunk/COPYING.WTFPL?revision=2&amp;view=markup Version 1.0 license] on anonscm.debian.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the [[Creative commons]] released the [[Creative Commons license#Zero .2F public domain|CC0]], which was created for [[License compatibility|compatibility]] with law domains which have no concept of ''dedicating into public domain''. This is achieved by a public domain waiver statement and a fall-back all-permissive license, in case the waiver is not possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://creativecommons.org/2009/06/17/1117-lulan-artisans-textile-competition/ |title= 11/17: Lulan Artisans Textile Competition |date=17 June 2009 |publisher= |accessdate=30 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161231080413/https://creativecommons.org/2009/06/17/1117-lulan-artisans-textile-competition/ |archivedate=31 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CC0"&gt;[https://rd-alliance.org/sites/default/files/cc0-analysis-kreuzer.pdf Validity of the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication and its usability for bibliographic metadata from the perspective of German Copyright Law] by Dr. Till Kreutzer, attorney-at-law in [[Berlin, Germany]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Unlicense]], published around 2010, has a focus on an [[Anti-copyright]] message. The Unlicense offers a public domain waiver text with a fall-back public domain-like license inspired by permissive licenses but without attribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ostatic.com/blog/the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324154539/http://ostatic.com/blog/the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license |date=24 March 2016 }} on ostatic.com by Joe Brockmeier (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unlicense.org The Unlicense] on unlicense.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] recommends the Creative Commons [[CC0]] license to dedicate content to the public domain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/licenses/ licenses] on opendefinition.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2013/12/27/creative-commons-4-0-by-and-by-sa-licenses-approved-conformant-with-the-open-definition/ Creative Commons 4.0 BY and BY-SA licenses approved conformant with the Open Definition] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.org (27 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)'' for data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/ pddl] on opendatacommons.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patents==
{{Main article|Term of patent}}
In most countries, the term of rights for patents is 20 years, after which the invention becomes part of the public domain. In the United States, the contents of patents are considered valid and enforceable for 20 years from the date of filing within the United States or 20 years from the earliest date of filing if under 35 USC 120, 121, or 365(c).&lt;ref&gt;Manual of Patent Examining Procedure available at {{cite web |url= http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2701.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150418103411/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2701.html |archivedate= 18 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''text'' and any ''illustration'' within a patent, provided the illustrations are essentially line drawings and do not in any substantive way reflect the "personality" of the person drawing them, are not subject to copyright protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uspto.gov/main/ccpubguide.htm |title= Terms of Use for USPTO Websites |first= Office of the Chief Communications |last=Officer |publisher= |accessdate=30 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090925103511/http://www.uspto.gov/main/ccpubguide.htm |archivedate= 25 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is separate from the ''patent'' rights just mentioned.

==Trademarks==
A trademark registration may remain in force indefinitely, or expire without specific regard to its age. For a trademark registration to remain valid, the owner must continue to use it. In some circumstances, such as disuse, failure to assert trademark rights, or common usage by the public without regard for its intended use, it could become [[genericized trademark|generic]], and therefore part of the public domain.

Because trademarks are registered with governments, some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark, while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry. For example, the drug "acetylsalicylic acid" (2-acetoxybenzoic acid) is better known as ''[[aspirin]]'' in the United States—a generic term. In Canada, however, "Aspirin", with an uppercase A, is still a trademark of the German company [[Bayer]], while aspirin, with a lowercase "a", is not. Bayer lost the trademark in the United States, the UK and France after World War I, as part of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. So many copycat products entered the marketplace during the war that it was deemed generic just three years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofmolecules.com/drugs/aspirin.htm Aspirin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824141625/http://www.worldofmolecules.com/drugs/aspirin.htm |date=24 August 2005 }}, World of Molecules&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayer also lost the trademark in the same jurisdictions for "Heroin" which it trademarked a year before it trademarked Aspirin.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Although [[Hormel]] resigned itself to genericide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.spam.com/about/internet.aspx |archive-url= http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091013192409/http://www.spam.com/about/internet.aspx |dead-url= yes |archive-date=13 October 2009 |title=SPAM® Brand and the Internet |publisher= Hormel Foods}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has fought attempts by other companies to register "[[spam (food)|spam]]" as a [[trademark]] [[spamming|in relation to computer products]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/31/spam_ruling/ |title=Hormel Spam trademark case canned |author=Kieren McCarthy |date=31 January 2005 |accessdate=2 September 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080707001848/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/31/spam_ruling/ |archivedate=7 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Domain Day ==
{{main article|Public Domain Day}}
[[File:Logo PDD 2016.svg |thumb|An English logo of the 2015/2016 Public Domain Day in Poland]]

Public Domain Day is an observance of when [[copyright]]s expire and works enter into the public domain.&lt;ref name="telcouk"&gt;{{cite web |last= Richmond |first=Shane |url= http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/shanerichmond/100004467/happy-public-domain-day-heres-to-many-more/ |title=Happy Public Domain Day!

'''''Shan shui''''' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:山|山]][[wikt:水|水]]|p=shān shuǐ|l=mountain-water}}; pronounced {{IPAc-cmn|sh|an|1|-|sh|ui|3}}) refers to a style of traditional [[Chinese painting]] that involves or depicts [[scenery]] or natural [[Landscape art|landscape]]s, using a [[Ink brush|brush]] and [[ink]] rather than more conventional paints. Mountains, rivers and often waterfalls are prominent in this art form.

==History==
''Shan shui'' painting first arose to prominence during the 5th century,&lt;ref name="goo"&gt;Textual Evidence for the Secular Arts of China in the Period from [[Liu Song Dynasty|Liu Sung]] through Sui by [[Alexander Soper]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the reign of the [[Liu Song dynasty]]. It was later characterized by a group of landscape painters such as [[Zhang Zeduan]],&lt;ref name="oldmaster"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sirén|first=Osvald|title=Chinese Painting: Leading Masters and Principles|publisher=Ronald Press |year=1956|pages=62, 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of them already famous, who produced large-scale landscape paintings. These landscape paintings usually centered on mountains. Mountains had long been seen as sacred places in China,&lt;ref name="chineseeye" /&gt; which were viewed as the homes of immortals and thus, close to the heavens. Philosophical interest in nature, or in mystical connotations of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], could also have contributed to the rise of landscape painting. The art of ''shan shui'', like many other styles of Chinese painting has a strong reference to [[Taoism|Taoist]] imagery and motifs,&lt;ref name=Northrop/&gt; as symbolisms of Taoism strongly influenced "Chinese landscape painting".&lt;ref name=Northrop&gt;{{cite book|title=Ideological Differences and World Order: Studies in the Philosophy and Science of the World's Culture|author=Northrop, Filmer Stuart Cuckow|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=1949|isbn=0-8371-5228-3|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have suggested that Daoist stress on how minor the human presence is in the vastness of the cosmos, or Neo-[[Confucian]] interest in the patterns or principles that underlie all phenomena, natural and social lead to the highly structuralized nature of ''shan shui''.&lt;ref name="fooe"&gt;{{cite book|title=Two Twelfth Century Texts on Chinese Painting|author=Robert J. Maeda|publisher=[[University of Michigan]], Center for Chinese Studies|year=1970|isbn=0-89264-008-1|page=16|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts==
Most dictionaries and definitions of ''shan shui'' assume that the term includes all ancient Chinese paintings with mountain and water images.&lt;ref name="oldmaster" /&gt; Contemporary [[List of Chinese painters|Chinese painters]], however, feel that only paintings with mountain and water images that follow specific conventions of form, style and function should be called "''shan shui'' painting".&lt;ref name="chineseeye" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fooe"/&gt; When Chinese painters work on ''shan shui'' painting, they do not try to present an image of what they have seen in the nature, but what they have thought about nature. No one cares whether the painted colors and shapes look like the real object or not.&lt;ref name="oldmaster" /&gt;

According to Ch'eng Hsi:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shan shui painting is a kind of painting which goes against the common definition of what a painting is. ''Shan shui'' painting refutes color, light and shadow and personal brush work. Shan shui painting is not an open window for the viewer's eye, it is an object for the viewer's mind. ''Shan shui'' painting is more like a vehicle of philosophy.&lt;ref name="fooe"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Compositions==
''Shan shui'' paintings involve a complicated and rigorous set of almost mystical requirements&lt;ref name="opi"&gt;Wicks, Robert 1954 – "Being in the Dry Zen Landscape", The Journal of Aesthetic Education – Volume 38, Number 1, Spring 2004, pp. 112–122&lt;/ref&gt; for balance, composition, and form. All ''shan shui'' paintings should have 3 basic components:

''Paths'' – Pathways should never be straight. They should meander like a stream. This helps deepen the landscape by adding layers. The path can be the river, or a path along it, or the tracing of the sun through the sky over the shoulder of the mountain.&lt;ref name="oldmaster" /&gt; The concept is to never create inorganic patterns, but instead to mimic the [[patterns in nature|patterns that nature creates]].

''The Threshold'' – The path should lead to a threshold. The threshold is there to embrace you and provide a special welcome. The threshold can be the mountain, or its shadow upon the ground, or its cut into the sky.&lt;ref name="oldmaster" /&gt; The concept is always that a mountain or its boundary must be defined clearly.

''The Heart'' – The heart is the focal point of the painting and all elements should lead to it. The heart defines the meaning of the painting.&lt;ref name="oldmaster" /&gt; The concept should imply that each painting has a single focal point, and that all the natural lines of the painting direct inwards to this point.

==Elements and colors==
''Shan shui'' is painted and designed in accordance with Chinese [[Wu Xing|elemental theory]] with [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five elements]] representing various parts of the natural world, and thus has specific directions for colorations that should be used in 'directions' of the painting, as to which should dominate.&lt;ref name="foo5"&gt;Early Chinese Texts on Painting by Susan Bush, [[Hsio-yen Shih]]. Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews (CLEAR), Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Jul., 1985), pp. 153-159&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive interactions between the Elements are:

*Wood produces Fire 
*Fire produces Earth
*Earth produces Metal 
*Metal produces Water
*Water produces Wood.

Elements that react positively should be used together. For example, Water complements both Metal and Wood; therefore, a painter would combine blue and green or blue and white. There is a positive interaction between Earth and Fire, so a painter would mix Yellow and Red.&lt;ref name="chineseeye"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yee|first=Chiang|author2=S.I. Hsiung |title=The Chinese eye: An interpretation of Chinese painting|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative interactions between the Elements are:

*Wood uproots Earth
*Earth blocks Water
*Water douses Fire
*Fire melts Metal
*Metal chops Wood

Elements that interact negatively should never be used together. For example, Fire will not interact positively with Water or Metal so a painter would not choose to mix red and blue, or red and white.&lt;ref name="goo"/&gt;

==Connection to poetry==
{{Main|Shanshui poetry}}
A certain movement in [[Chinese poetry|poetry]], influenced by the ''shan shui'' style, came to be known as ''[[Shanshui poetry]]''. Sometimes, the poems were designed to be viewed with a particular work of art, others were intended to be "textual art" that invoked an image inside a reader's mind.&lt;ref name="poetry"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu-chin Sun|first=Cecile |title=Pearl from the Dragon's Mouth: Evocation of Scene and Feeling in Chinese Poetry|publisher=Center for Chinese Studies|location=University of Michigan|year=1995|isbn=9780892641109|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

===Animation and film===
The art form of ''shan shui'' has been popular to the point where a [[Chinese animation]] from 1988 entitled ''[[Feeling from Mountain and Water]]'' uses the same art style and even the term for the film's title. Additionally, many recent [[movies]] and [[Play (theatre)|plays]] produced in China, specifically ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'', use elements of the style itself in the sets, as well as the elemental aspects in providing "balance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berry|first=Michael|title=Speaking in Images: Interviews with Contemporary Chinese Filmmakers|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780231133319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
The term ''shan shui'' is sometimes extended to include gardening and [[landscape design]], particularly within the context of ''[[feng shui]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Birmingham Museum of Art|title=Landscape Painting in Contemporary China|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=Birmingham, Alabama|year=1984|isbn=9780931394164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shusha Realni School''' was a school with six classes, located in Shusha, Azerbaijan. The school's building phase was completed in 1881.

==History==
In the 19th century, new types of schools began to appear in Azerbaijan. During this period, there was only one main school in Baku, and one classical gymnasium in Ganja. This changed after the demand for education in the region grew, two schools were no longer sufficient thus prompting the population of the city to appeal to the Petersburg-Caucasian committee. The appeal stated:
 {{cquote|''"Ganja governor requests to open a sixth-grade real school in Shusha city, based on the willingness and demand of the residents to study (Studying more than 400 students at City School reaffirms this initiative once more) and the desire of the city community. The city community is committed to providing the school with the appropriate building and helping with 7500 manats a year. "''}}

The efforts of the local population led led to the foundation of the school in Shusha on September 20, 1881. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title= Cənubi Qafqazın ən qədim məktəbi|url= http://kaspi.az/az/cenubi-qafqazin-en-qedim-mektebi/?action=disablemobile |website= kaspi.az |accessdate=30 January 2018|language=Azerbaijani}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the first years of the school's opening, 159 pupils were enrolled in the school, consisting of preparatory classes and three main classes, 58 of the students were Azerbaijani, 91 were Armenian, whilst the other 10 were student from other nationalities. In 1886, 7,500 manats were spent on the school.

In 1890, a representative of the Caucasian Ministry of education brought Ziaaddovla Anishirəvan, Mirza Qajar, and anthropologist Shantr. This arrival peaked the interest of the students, which lowered the percentage of absence at the school to 7.64%. The school was an open-minded establishment which promoted the acquisition of languages other than Azerbaijani. In 1890, contrary to the Tbilisi schools, German was not forced upon the students, but the choice to learn it was made available. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title= Böyük elm ocağı Şuşa Realnı Məktəbi |url= https://news.milli.az/culture/136296.html |website= news.milli.az|accessdate=30 January 2018|language=Azerbaijani}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mirza Salah bey Zohrabbeyov, Yusif bey Malikhaqnazarov, Hashim bey Vazirov, were part of the well-known educators of the time, who taught in the School. The two famous Azerbaijani writers [[Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev]] and [[Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli]] were amongst the students who enrolled at the Shusha Realni School.

"'''The Blessed Damozel'''" is perhaps the best known poem by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] as well as the title of some of his best known paintings. The poem was first published in 1850 in the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] journal ''[[The Germ (periodical)|The Germ]]''. Rossetti subsequently revised the poem twice and republished it in 1856, 1870 and 1873. &lt;ref name="Rarchive"&gt;{{cite web

The poem was partially inspired by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem "[[The Raven]]",&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/VICTORIAN/topic_3/damozel.htm The Painterly Image in Poetry]." ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature: The Victorian Age''. 2009. Norton and Company. 3 Jun 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; with its depiction of a lover grieving on Earth over the death of his loved one. Rossetti chose to represent the situation in reverse. The poem describes the [[wiktionary:damsel|damozel]] observing her lover from heaven, and her unfulfilled yearning for their reunion in heaven. 

The poem also was the inspiration for [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La Damoiselle élue]]'' (1888), a cantata for two soloists, female choir, and orchestra.

The first four stanzas of the poem are inscribed on the frame of the painting.

{{quote|
The blessed damozel leaned out &lt;br&gt;
From the gold bar of Heaven; &lt;br&gt;
Her eyes were deeper than the depth &lt;br&gt;
Of waters stilled at even; &lt;br&gt;
She had three lilies in her hand, &lt;br&gt;
And the stars in her hair were seven. 

Her robe, ungirt from clasp to hem, &lt;br&gt;
No wrought flowers did adorn, &lt;br&gt;
But a white rose of Mary's gift, &lt;br&gt;
For service meetly worn;  &lt;br&gt;
Her hair that lay along her back &lt;br&gt;
Was yellow like ripe corn. 

Herseemed she scarce had been a day &lt;br&gt;

''The Blessed Damozel'' is the only one of Rossetti's paired pictures and poems in which the poem was completed first. Friends and patrons repeatedly urged Rossetti to illustrate his most famous poem,&lt;ref name="Treuherz100"&gt;Treuherz et al. (2003), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; and he finally accepted a commission from William Graham in February 1871. After the work was completed Graham requested a [[predella]], the lower part of the painting, on December 31, 1877.  His total cost was £1157.  [[Alexa Wilding]] modelled the damozel in Paradise, Wilfred John Hawtrey modelled the child–angel, and the probable model for the left–hand angel was [[May Morris]].
Another, later version is in the [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]].

[[Frederick Richards Leyland]] commissioned eighteen paintings from Rossetti, not counting unfulfilled commissions.  Soon after Leyland acquired his first Rossetti painting, he and Rossetti explored the idea of a Rossetti [[triptych]], which was eventually formed with ''[[Mnemosyne (Rossetti)|Mnemosyne]]'', an 1879 replica of ''The Blessed Damozel'' painted by Rossetti himself, and ''Proserpine''.&lt;ref&gt;''Waking Dreams'', p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Three additional Rossetti paintings were then hung in Leyland's drawing room, all of which Leyland called "stunners."&lt;ref name=figure&gt;''Waking Dreams'', p. 26 (figure 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Several pieces of music were based on the poem, including those for orchestra by [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Granville Bantock]] (1891), [[Edgar Bainton]] (1907), [[Ernest Farrar]] (1907); for piano by [[Arnold Bax]] (1906); for string quartet by [[Benjamin Burrows]] (1927); and a 1928 choral by [[Julius Harrison]].  A 2007 modern popular song of the same name by [[Tangerine Dream]] appears on their album ''[[Madcap's Flaming Duty]]''.

{{italic title}}
'''''The Fair Penitent''''' is [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe's]] stage adaptation of the tragedy ''[[The Fatal Dowry]],'' the [[Philip Massinger]] and [[Nathan Field]] collaboration first published in 1632. Rowe's adaptation, premiered onstage in 1702 and first published in 1703, was a great popular success through much of the 18th century, and was praised by critics as demanding as [[Samuel Johnson]] ("There is scarcely any work of any poet so interesting by the fable and so delightful in the language").&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Brawley, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

In making his adaptation, Rowe eliminated characters and simplified the action "to create a more focused play than the original." He pursued "neoclassical simplicity" but in the process sacrificed the "underlying moral principles" of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, pp. 98-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe shifted the setting from [[Dijon]] to [[Genoa]], and changed the main characters' names:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|''Fatal Dowry''
|''Fair Penitent''
|-
|Rochfort
|Sciolto
|-
|Charalois
|Altamont
|-
|Romont
|Horatio
|-
|Novall Junior
|Lothario
|-
|Pontalier
|Rossano
|-
|Beaumelle
|Calista
|-
|Bellapert
|Lucilla
|}

Rowe also accentuated the role of the [[female protagonist]], making the play much more a vehicle for a female star performer, a "better acting piece" for a prominent actress.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, pp. 124-7. In the original production of ''The Fatal Dowry,'' all the female roles were played by [[boy player|boy actors]], since women did not appear on the English stage until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era.&lt;/ref&gt; Where the original "concentrates largely on the legal and political affairs of the cuckolded husband," Rowe focused far more directly on the domestic tragedy of Calista's infidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was staged at both of the major London theatres of the day, [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]]; the former production starred [[Sarah Siddons|Mrs. Siddons]] as Calista. The 1703 first edition was dedicated to the [[Duchess of Ormond]]&amp;mdash;but did not credit the original authors of ''The Fatal Dowry,'' leading to later critics' accusations of [[plagiarism]] against Rowe, as in [[William Gifford]]'s edition of Massinger's works.

==Legacy==
The [[eponym]] "[[Lothario]]," meaning "a man who seduces women," stems from the character in this play. The origin of Lothario as a name indicating a seducer though predates the play. The latter is thought to be written in 1619. The character of Lothario as a seducer, albeit in different circumstances, appears earlier in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' by [[Cervantes]]. In this story Lothario is urged by his lifelong friend [[Don Quixote#Other stories|Anselmo]] to attempt to seduce his wife in order to test her faithfulness. At first most unwilling he eventually enters into the scheme with skill and success. This earlier Lothario is a successful seducer.

[[Malcolm Goldstein]] edited ''The Fair Penitent'' for a modern edition in 1969. Critics, both traditional and modern, have debated whether Calista is actually "penitent" for her infidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Marriage Feast At Cana''''' is a painting that was until recently attributed to [[Hieronymus Bosch]]. The painting resides at the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] in [[Rotterdam]], the Netherlands.
Several copies exist of this picture.  Until recently the copy in Boijmans has been considered the original.  Dendrochronological analysis, however, has now proven conclusively that it cannot have been painted earlier than 1550.

==Provenance==
A wedding-feast by or after Bosch belonged to the Rubens collection in [[Antwerp]].
The painting at Boijmans was bought in Antwerp by an English painter.  It has been sawed down and the upper corners subsequently shaped into steps.  At the time it showed a portrait and only when the overpainting was removed did the tempera painting of the wedding come to light.  “What was revealed was a poor, not to say, wholly disfigured, painting”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Roger H.|last= Marijnissen|title=Hieronymus Bosch.

'''The Plastic Club''' is an arts organization located in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Founded in 1897, the Plastic Club is one of the oldest art clubs in the United States. It is located on the 200 block of Camac Street, the "Little Street of Clubs" that was a cultural destination in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hiddencityphila.org/2014/03/little-clubs-on-a-wooden-street/|title=Little Clubs On A Wooden Street {{!}} Hidden City Philadelphia|website=hiddencityphila.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1991, the club's membership also includes men.&lt;ref name=HSP /&gt;

==History==
The Plastic Club was founded by art educator [[Emily Sartain]]. It was founded as an arts organization for women to promote collaboration and members' works, partly in response to the [[Philadelphia Sketch Club]], an exclusively male arts club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Hook|first=Bailey|date=2009-01-01|title=The Early Career of Violet Oakley, Illustrator|jstor=40605220|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=30|issue=1|pages=29–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first President was the etcher [[Blanche Dillaye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Croly|first1=Jane Cunningham|title=The History of the Women's Club Movement in America|date=1898|publisher=Henry G.

The club offered art classes, social events, and exhibitions.

==History==
The story of [[Philoctetes (Sophocles play)|Philoctetes]], dealing with the wounded man and the interwoven relationships with others, has been frequently noted. In 2005, [[Bryan Doerries]], writer and director, began a series of readings of the play in the [[New York City]] area. 
Noting the reactions of the audience to the reading, especially related to the reactions of audience members to the interaction of the suffering soldier and the conflicted caregiver. The project revolves around presenting such readings, especially to audiences of medical professionals and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/theatre-of-war-sophocles-message-for-american-veterans|title=Theatre of War: Sophocles’ Message for American Veterans|last=Wright|first=Robin|date=2016-09-12|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-12-12|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of readings were followed by a panel discussion about doctor-patient relationships, involving presenters in psychiatry, physicians, and military medical personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/theater-of-war/|title=Theater of War: Soldiers and Citizens Tour - National Council|website=www.thenationalcouncil.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=TKR_Archives&amp;Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentIDID=2674|title=About the Philoctetes Project, The Key Reporter (Phi Beta Kappa)|last=Doerries|first=Bryan|date=Spring 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129202142/http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=TKR_Archives|archivedate=2006-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has also been extended to training of medical students, such as a presentation also in 2007 to the first year medical class at [[Weill Medical College]] of [[Cornell University]], involving not only the students, but also faculty members. The presentation included a discussion of an actual case dealing with the patient-caregiver interactions that parallel the situation that Sophocles presented.

In 2008, at a conference dedicated to finding new ways to help [[US Marines]] recover from post-traumatic stress and other disorders after serving in [[Iraq]] or [[Afghanistan]], four New York actors presented a dramatic reading from ''Philoctetes'' and [[Ajax (Sophocles)|''Ajax'']]. The plays focused on physical and psychological wounds inflicted on the warrior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-combat15-2008aug15,0,6770815.story latimes.com] Story by Tony Perry, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/books/review/the-theater-of-war-by-bryan-doerries.html|title=‘The Theater of War,’ by Bryan Doerries|last=Shapiro|first=James|date=2015-10-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also presented plays such as: “[[Prometheus Bound]],”, and “[[Women of Trachis|The Women of Trachis]]”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''Unitary urbanism''' ('''UU''') was the critique of ''[[status quo]]'' "[[urbanism]]", employed by the [[Letterist International]] and then further developed by the [[Situationist International]] between 1953 and 1960.

The [[praxis (process)|praxis]] originates from the [[Lettrist]] technique of [[hypergraphics]] which was applied to architecture by the Lettrist International (LI). The UU critique of [[urbanism]] was further developed in the 1950s by the LI, and consists of a range of practices that include, but are not limited to:
* The situation
* The [[dérive]] (drift)
* [[Psychogeography]]
* [[Détournement]]
* [[Industrial Painting|industrial painting]]
* [[Revolution]]

The critical practice continued to be developed by the Situationists and others. It was largely abandoned for the Debordian theory of the [[Society of the Spectacle|spectacle]] after the [[Second Situationist International]] and [[Situationist Antinational]] were formed. [[London]] based [[evoL PsychogeogrAphix]] is one of the few groups openly practicing unitary urbanism today.

Unitary urbanism was announced as a very specific praxis at the [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]] platform between the Lettrist International and the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]]. In his Address to the Alba Conference in September 1956, the Lettrist International Delegate [[Gil J Wolman]] said: "A unitary urbanism—the synthesis of art and technology that we call for—must be constructed according to certain new values of life, values which now need to be distinguished and disseminated."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/wolman.html&lt;/ref&gt; This mode of urban practice was also called for in a tract distributed during a demonstration by Lettrists in [[Turin]], [[Italy]] in December 1956.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notbored.org/UU.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constant Nieuwenhuys]] and [[Guy Debord]] disagreed about the praxis, issuing the designation "the complex, ongoing activity which consciously recreates [[man]]'s [[urban environment|environment]] according to the most advanced conceptions in every domain," however the widening gulf between Nieuwenhuys' "structural" approach and Debord's focus on "content" eventually lead to Nieuwenhuy's split from the [[Situationist International|SI]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notbored.org/ten-years-on.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Unitary urbanism, one of the major early Situationist concerns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialfiction.org/psychogeography/unitary_urbanism.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 27, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060808190435/http://www.socialfiction.org/psychogeography/unitary_urbanism.html |archivedate=August 8, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stands on two tenets:
* The rejection of the standard [[Euclid]]ean, almost wholly functional, approach to urban architectural design, and
* The rejection of the compartmentalized way in which "art" is typically detached from its surroundings.

In the relative [[utopia]] of the UU ideal, the structural and artistic elements of human's [[metropolis|metropolitan]] surroundings are blended into such [[wikt:grey area|grey area]] that one cannot identify where function ends and play begins. The resulting [[society]], while it caters to fundamental needs, does so in an atmosphere of continual exploration, leisure, and stimulating ambience.

==Quotes==
"'Whatever prestige the [[bourgeoisie]] may today be willing to grant to fragmentary or deliberately retrograde artistic tentatives, creation can now be nothing less than a synthesis aiming at the construction of entire atmospheres and styles of life.&amp;nbsp;... A unitary urbanism—the synthesis we call for, incorporating arts and technologies—must be created in accordance with new values of life, values which we now need to distinguish and disseminate.'"&lt;br&gt;—George Williams, "La plate-forme d’Alba"; originally appeared in Potlatch: Information Bulletin of the Lettrist International #27 (Paris, 2 November 1956), quoting  Gil J Wolman.

The '''Winter Palace''' ({{lang-rus|Зимний дворец|Zimnij dvorets|p=ˈzʲimnʲɪj dvɐˈrʲɛts}}) in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, was, from 1732 to 1917, the official residence of the [[List of Russian rulers|Russian monarchs]]. Today, the restored palace forms part of a complex of buildings housing the [[Hermitage Museum]]. Situated between the [[Palace Embankment]] and the [[Palace Square]], adjacent to the site of [[Peter the Great]]'s original Winter Palace, the present and fourth Winter Palace was built and altered almost continuously between the late 1730s and 1837, when it was severely damaged by fire and immediately rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;The numbering of the Winter Palaces varies. Most referees used in the writing of this page refer to the present palace as the fourth. That is: Trezzini, 1711 (I);  Mattarnovy, 1721 (II); Trezzini, 1727 (III) and Rastrelli, 1732 (IV). Thus, to agree with the majority and because these four versions were "palaces" each differing from the last rather than recreations, this will be the numbering used here. However, other sources count the log cabin of Peter the Great as the first palace, while others discount Trezzini's 1727 rebuilding and others count the 1837 reconstruction as a 5th Winter palace. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071126025206/http://spbcity.info/eng/content/view/44/30/ One source] (not used here) numbers a temporary wooden structure erected to house the court during the building of the present palace.&lt;/ref&gt; The storming of the palace in 1917 as depicted in Soviet paintings and [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]'s 1927 film ''October'' became an iconic symbol of the [[Russian Revolution]].

The palace was constructed on a monumental scale that was intended to reflect the might and power of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. From the palace, the [[Tsar]]&lt;ref&gt;In 1721, Tsar [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] received the title of Emperor from the [[Governing Senate]]. Scholars use the titles of "Tsar" and "Emperor" (and their feminine forms) interchangeably.&lt;/ref&gt; ruled over {{convert|22400000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} (almost 1/6 of the Earth's landmass) and over 125&amp;nbsp;million subjects by the end of the 19th century. It was designed by many architects, most notably [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]], in what came to be known as the [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabethan Baroque]] style. The green-and-white palace has the shape of an elongated rectangle, and its principal façade is {{convert|215|m|ft}} long and {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The Winter Palace has been calculated to contain 1,786 doors, 1,945 windows, 1,500 rooms and 117 staircases. Following a serious fire, the palace's rebuilding of 1837 left the exterior unchanged, but large parts of the interior were redesigned in a variety of tastes and styles, leading the palace to be described as a "19th-century palace inspired by a model in [[Rococo]] style".&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200"&gt;Budberg, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]] massacre occurred when demonstrators marched toward the Winter Palace, but by this time the Imperial Family had chosen to live in the more secure and secluded [[Alexander Palace]] at [[Tsarskoe Selo]], and returned to the Winter Palace only for formal and state occasions. Following the February Revolution of 1917, the palace was for a short time the seat of the [[Russian Provisional Government]], led by [[Alexander Kerensky]]. Later that same year, the palace was stormed by a detachment of [[Red Army]] soldiers and sailors—a defining moment in the birth of the Soviet state.

== Peter the Great's Winter Palace (1711–1753) ==
[[File:1st Winter Palace.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The first Winter Palace, designed in 1711 for Peter the Great, by [[Domenico Trezzini]] who, 16 years later, was to design the third Winter Palace.]]

Later returning from his [[Grand_Embassy_of_Peter_the_Great|Grand Embassy]] in 1698, [[Peter I of Russia]] embarked on a policy of [[Westernization]] and expansion that was to transform the [[Tsardom of Russia]] into the [[Russian Empire]] and a major European power.&lt;ref&gt;Massie 1981, pp. 234–243&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was manifested in bricks and mortar by the creation of a new city, Saint Petersburg, in 1703.&lt;ref&gt;Massie 1981, pp. 355–366&lt;/ref&gt; The culture and design of the new city was intended as a conscious rejection of traditional [[Byzantine]]-influenced [[Russian architecture]], such as the then-fashionable [[Naryshkin Baroque]], in favour of the classically inspired architecture prevailing in the great cities of Europe. The Tsar intended that his new city would be designed in a Flemish renaissance style, later known as [[Petrine Baroque]], and this was the style he selected for his new palace in the city. The first Royal residence on the site had been a humble log cabin then known as the [[Cabin of Peter the Great|Domik Petra I]], built in 1704, which faced the [[River Neva]]. In 1711 it was transported to the Petrovskaya Naberezhnaya&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saint-petersburg.com/embankments/peters-quay/ Peter's Quay on the St Petersburg Website]&lt;/ref&gt;, where it still stands.&lt;ref name="Petrakova"&gt;Petrakova&lt;/ref&gt;  With the site cleared, the Tsar then embarked on the building of a larger house between 1711 and 1712. This house, today referred to as the first Winter Palace, was designed by [[Domenico Trezzini]].&lt;ref&gt;Swiss Architecture on the Neva. Trezzini, catalogue of works. 1711&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century was a period of great development in European royal architecture, as the need for a fortified residence gradually lessened. This process, which had begun in the late 16th century, accelerated and great classical palaces quickly replaced fortified castles throughout the more powerful European countries. One of the earliest and most notable examples was [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. Largely completed by 1710, Versailles—with its size and splendour—heightened rivalry amongst the sovereigns of Europe. Peter the Great of Russia, keen to promote all western concepts, wished to have a modern palace like his fellow sovereigns. However, unlike some of his successors, Peter I never aspired to rival Versailles.

[[File:PtheGspalace.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The third Winter Palace of 1727. Designed by [[Domenico Trezzini]] it incorporated the second Winter Palace of 1721 by [[Georg Mattarnovy]] as one of its terminating pavilions.]]

The first Winter Palace was a modest building of two main floors under a slate roof.&lt;ref&gt;Budberg, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Peter soon tired of the first palace, for in 1721, the second version of the Winter Palace was built under the direction of architect [[Georg Johann Mattarnovy|Georg Mattarnovy]]. Mattarnovy's palace, though still very modest compared to royal palaces in other European capitals, was on two floors above a rusticated ground floor, with a central projection underneath a [[pediment]] supported by columns.&lt;ref&gt;Budberg, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that Peter the Great died in 1725.

The Winter Palace was not the only palace in the unfinished city, or even the most splendid, as Peter had ordered his nobles to construct residences and to spend half the year there.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.49"&gt;Cowles, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an unpopular command; Saint Petersburg was founded upon a swamp, with little sunlight, and it was said only cabbages and turnips would grow there. It was forbidden to fell trees for fuel, so hot water was permitted just once a week. Only Peter's second wife, Empress [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine]], pretended to enjoy life in the new city.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.49" /&gt;

As a result of pressed slave labour from all over the Empire,&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.58"&gt;Cowles, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; work on the city progressed quickly. It has been estimated that 200,000 people died in twenty years while building the city.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.58" /&gt; A diplomat of the time, who described the city as "a heap of villages linked together, like some plantation in the West Indies", just a few years later called it "a wonder of the world, considering its magnificent palaces".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these new palaces in Peter's beloved Flemish Baroque style, such as the [[:File:Kikin.jpg|Kikin Hall]] and the [[Menshikov Palace]], still stand.

It is one of the few parts of the palace retaining Rastrelli's 18th century rococo style. The massive grey granite columns were, however, added in the mid-19th century.

On Peter the Great's death in 1725, the city of Saint Petersburg was still far from being the centre of western culture and civilization that he had envisioned. Many of the aristocrats who had been compelled by the Tsar to inhabit Saint Petersburg left. Wolves roamed the squares at night while bands of discontented pressed [[serf]]s, imported to build the Tsar's new city and [[Baltic fleet]], frequently rebelled.

Peter I was succeeded by his widow, Catherine I, who reigned until her death in 1727. She in turn was succeeded by Peter I's grandson [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]], who in 1727 had Mattarnovy's palace greatly enlarged by the architect [[Domenico Trezzini]].&lt;ref name="Petrakova" /&gt; Trezzini, who had designed the Summer Palace in 1711, was one of the greatest exponents of the [[Petrine Baroque]] style, now completely redesigned and expanded Mattarnovy's existing Winter Palace to such an extent that Mattarnovy's entire palace became merely one of the two terminating pavilions of the new, and third, Winter Palace.&lt;ref&gt;Budberg, p196&lt;/ref&gt; The third palace, like the second, was in the Petrine Baroque style.

In 1728, shortly after the third palace was completed, the Imperial Court left Saint Petersburg for Moscow, and the Winter Palace lost its status as the principal imperial residence. Moscow had once again been designated the capital city, a status which had been granted to Saint Petersburg in 1713. Following the death of Peter II in 1730, the throne passed to a niece of Peter I, [[Anna of Russia|Anna Ivanovna, Duchess of Courland]].

=== Anna (1730–1740) ===
The new Empress cared more for Saint Petersburg than her immediate predecessors; she re-established the Imperial court at the Winter Palace and, in 1732, Saint Petersburg again officially replaced Moscow as Russia's capital, a position it was to hold until 1918.

Ignoring the third Winter Palace, the Empress on her return to Saint Petersburg took up residence at the neighbouring Apraksin Palace.&lt;ref name="Petrakova" /&gt; In 1732, the Tsaritsa commissioned the architect [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] to completely rebuild and extend the Apraksin Palace, incorporating other neighbouring houses.&lt;ref&gt;Patrakova&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the core of the fourth and final Winter Palace is not the palace of Peter the Great, but the palace of Admiral General [[Fyodor Matveyevich Apraksin]].&lt;ref name="Petrakova" /&gt;

The Empress Anna, though unpopular and considered "dull, coarse, fat, harsh and spiteful",&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; was keen to introduce a more civilized and cultured air to her court. She designed new liveries for her servants and, on her orders, mead and vodka were replaced with champagne and Burgundy. She instructed the [[Boyars]] to replace their plain furniture with that of mahogany and ebony,&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; while her own tastes in interior decoration ran to a dressing table of solid gold and an "[[easing stool]]" of silver, studded with rubies. It was against such a backdrop of magnificence and extravagance that she gave her first ball in the newly completed gallery at the Winter Palace, which, in the middle of the Russian winter, resembled an orange grove.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; This, the fourth version of the Winter Palace, was to be an ongoing project for the architect Rastrelli throughout the reign of the Empress Anna.

===Elizabeth (1741–1762)===
{{Winter Palace}}
The infant Tsar [[Ivan VI of Russia|Ivan VI]], succeeding Anna in 1740, was soon deposed in a bloodless coup d'état by [[Elizabeth of Russia|Grand Duchess Elizabeth]], a daughter of Peter the Great. Delegating almost all powers to her favourites, the new Empress Elizabeth assumed a life of pleasure which led the court at the Winter Palace to be described later by the Russian historian [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]] as a place of "gilded squalor".&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of Elizabeth, Rastrelli, still working to his original plan, devised an entirely new scheme in 1753, on a colossal scale—the present Winter Palace. The expedited completion of the palace became a matter of honour to the Empress, who regarded the palace as a symbol of national prestige. Work on the building continued throughout the year, even in the severest months of the winter. The deprivation to both the Russian people and the army caused by the ongoing [[Seven Years' War]] were not permitted to hinder the progress. 859,555 [[Russian ruble|rubles]] had been allocated to the project, a sum raised by a tax on state-owned taverns.&lt;ref name="Brumfield1983"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brumfield|first=William Craft|title=Gold in azure: one thousand years of Russian architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eBRQAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=October 1983|publisher=D.R. Godine|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the labourers earned a monthly wage of just one ruble, the cost of the project exceeded the budget, so much so that work ceased due to lack of resources despite the Empress' obsessive desire for rapid completion. Ultimately, taxes were increased on salt and alcohol to fund the extra costs, although the Russian people were already burdened by taxes to pay for the war. The final cost was 2,500,000 rubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Orloff, Alexander |author2=Shvidkovsky, Dmitri |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Saint Petersburg: Architecture of the Tsars|publisher=Abbeville Press|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=0-7892-0217-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1759, shortly before Elizabeth's death, a Winter Palace truly worthy of the name was nearing completion.

===Catherine II (1762–1796)===
It was Empress Elizabeth who selected the German princess, Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst, as a bride for her nephew and successor, [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]]. The marriage was not a success, but it was this princess who, as [[Catherine the Great]], came to be chiefly associated with the Winter Palace. In 1762, following a coup d'état, in which her husband was murdered, Catherine paraded her seven-year-old son, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul]], on the Winter Palace's balcony to an excited crowd below.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; She was not presenting her son as the new and rightful ruler of Russia, however; that honour she was usurping herself.

[[File:St George'sHallWP.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[St George's Hall, and Apollo Hall of the Winter Palace|St George's Hall]] ''(13 on plan above)'', the principal throne room of the Tsars of Russia. The room was a late addition to the Palace for Catherine II. Painting by Konstantin Ukhtomsky]]
Catherine's patronage of the architects [[Ivan Starov|Starov]] and [[Giacomo Quarenghi]] saw the palace further enlarged and transformed.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200" /&gt; At this time an opera house which had existed in the southwestern wing of the palace was swept away to provide apartments for members of Catherine's family. In 1790, Quarenghi redesigned five of Rastrelli's state rooms to create the three vast halls of the [[Neva Enfilade of the Winter Palace|Neva enfilade]]. Catherine was responsible for the three large adjoining palaces, known collectively as the Hermitage—the name by which the entire complex, including the Winter Palace, was to become known 150 years later.

Catherine had been impressed by the French architect [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]], who designed the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] (also in Saint Petersburg) and commissioned him to add a new wing to the Winter Palace.&lt;ref name="AmeryCurran2006"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Amery|first1=Colin|last2=Curran|first2=Brian|title=St Petersburg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aV-BGNNDM2cC&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=2006|publisher=Frances Lincoln Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7112-2492-6|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was intended as a place of retreat from the formalities and ceremonies of the court. Catherine christened it the Hermitage ''(14)'', a name used by her predecessor Tsaritsa Elizabeth to describe her private rooms within the palace.

The interior of the Hermitage wing was intended to be a simple contrast to that of the Winter Palace. Indeed, it is said that the concept of the Hermitage as a retreat was suggested to Catherine by that advocate of the simple life, [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref name=Budberg201&gt;Budberg, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, it was another large palace in itself, connected to the main palace by a series of covered walkways and heated courtyards in which flew rare exotic birds.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.90"&gt;Cowles, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Noted for its fine portico and attention to details of a delicate nature,&lt;ref name="AmeryCurran2006"/&gt; it was richly furnished with an ever-growing art collection.

[[File:Frans Hals 058.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Frans Hals]]' ''Portrait of a Young Man Holding a Glove'', purchased for the Winter Palace in 1764]]
The palace's art collection was assembled haphazardly in an eclectic manner, often with an eye to quantity rather than quality. Many of the artworks purchased for the palaces arrived as parts of a job lot as the sovereign acquired whole ready-assembled collections. The Empress' ambassadors in Rome, Paris, Amsterdam and London were instructed to look out for and purchase thousands of priceless works of art on her behalf. Ironically, while Saint Petersburg high society and the extended Romanov family derided Russia's [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|last Empress]] for furnishing her palaces "mail order" from [[Sir John Blundell Maple, 1st Baronet|Maples]] of London, she was following the practices of Catherine the Great, who, if not exactly by "mail order", certainly bought "sight unseen."&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.90" /&gt;

In this way, between 1764 and 1781 Catherine the Great acquired six major collections: those of [[Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky]]; [[Heinrich von Brühl]]; [[Pierre Crozat]]; [[Horace Walpole]]; [[Sylvestre-Raphael Baudouin]]; and finally in 1787, the [[Lyde Browne (antiquary)|John Lyde-Brown]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1_11.html|title= 1787: Purchase of the John Lyde-Brown collection, London |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These large assemblies of art included works by such masters as [[Rembrandt]], [[Rubens]], [[Titian]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]] and [[Guido Reni|Reni]].&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.90" /&gt; The acquisition of 225 paintings forming the Gotzkowsky collection was a source of personal pride to Catherine. It had been put together by Gotzkowsky for Catherine's adversary, [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great of Prussia]] who, as a result of his wars with Russia, could not afford to pay for it. This collection included some great Flemish and Dutch works, most notably Frans Hals' "Portrait of a Young Man with a Glove."&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_4_1_3.html|title= The Great Hermitage |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1769, the Bruhl collection brought to the Winter Palace two further works by Rembrandt, ''Portrait of a Scholar'' and ''Portrait of an Old Man in Red''.

While some aspects of this manic collecting could have been a manifestation of Catherine's desire for a recognition of her intellectual concepts,&lt;ref name=Cowles93/&gt; there was also a more fundamental motivation: necessity. Just twenty years earlier, so scarce were the furnishings of the Imperial palaces that bedsteads, mirrors, tables and chairs had to be conveyed between Moscow and Saint Petersburg each time the court moved.&lt;ref&gt;Kluchevsky, vol IV, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the palace filled with art, it overflowed into the Hermitage. So large did Catherine's art collection eventually become that it became necessary to commission the German-trained architect Yury Velten to build a second and larger extension to the palace, which eventually became known as the Old Hermitage (''15''). Later, Catherine commissioned a third extension, the [[Hermitage Theatre]], designed by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman, pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; This construction necessitated the demolition of Peter the Great's by now crumbling third Winter palace.

[[File:Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn - A Scholar.JPG|thumb|200px|left|[[Rembrandt]]'s ''Portrait of a Scholar'' purchased in 1769. The painting is one of several by Rembrandt in the former Imperial Collection.]]
The Empress' life within the Hermitage, surrounded by her art and friends, was simpler than in the adjacent Winter Palace; there, the Empress gave small intimate suppers. Servants were excluded from these suppers and a sign on the wall read "Sit down where you choose, and when you please without it being repeated to you a thousand times."&lt;ref name="Cowles, p.90" /&gt;

Catherine was also responsible for introducing the lasting affection for all things French to the Russian court. While she personally disliked France, her distaste did not extend to its culture and manners.&lt;ref name=Cowles93&gt;Cowles, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; French became the language of the court; Russian was relegated for use only when speaking to servants and inferiors. The Russian aristocracy was encouraged to embrace the philosophies of [[Molière]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]].&lt;ref name=Cowles93/&gt; The Winter Palace was to serve as a model for numerous Russian palaces belonging to Catherine's aristocracy, all of them, like the Winter Palace itself, built by the slave labour of Russian serfs. The sophistication and manners observed inside the Winter Palace were greatly at odds with the grim reality of life outside its externally gilded walls. In 1767, as the Winter Palace grew in richness and splendour, the Empress published an edict extending [[Russian serfdom]]. During her reign she further enslaved over a million peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Work continued on the Winter Palace right up until the time of the Empress' death in 1796.

===Paul I, Alexander I, and Nicholas I (1796–1855)===
[[File:Winter Palace Rotonda1834.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Rotunda of the Winter Palace|The Rotunda]] ''(26)''. This circular hall, dating from the early 19th century, links the state and private rooms of the palace, and represents the final and neoclassical stage of the palace's evolution. Painting by [[Yefim Tukharinov]]]]
Catherine the Great was succeeded by her son [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]]. In the first days of his reign, the new Tsar (reported by the British Ambassador to be "not in his senses"&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p.119.&lt;/ref&gt;) augmented the number of troops stationed at the Winter Palace, positioning sentry boxes every few metres around the building. Eventually, paranoid for his security and disliking anything connected with his mother,&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; he spurned the Winter Palace completely and built [[Saint Michael's Castle]] as his Saint Petersburg residence, on the site of his birthplace. The Tsar announced that he wished to die on the spot he was born. He was murdered there three weeks after taking up residence in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul I was succeeded by his 24-year-old son, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], who ruled Russia during the chaotic period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1815, the contents of the Winter Palace were further enhanced when Alexander I purchased the art collection of the former French Empress, [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]]. This collection, some of it plundered loot given to her by her ex-husband [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]], contained amongst its many old masters Rembrandt's "The Descent from the Cross" and four sculptures by [[Antonio Canova]].&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt;

Alexander I was succeeded in 1825 by his brother [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. Tsar Nicholas was to be responsible for the palace's present appearance and layout. He not only effected many changes to the interior of the palace, but was responsible for its complete rebuilding following the fire of 1837.&lt;ref name="Crankshaw1976"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Crankshaw|first=Edward|title=The shadow of the winter palace: Russia's drift to revolution, 1825–1917|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-qCAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=1976|publisher=Viking Press|isbn=978-0-670-63782-9|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
As completed, the overriding exterior form of the Winter Palace's architecture, with its decoration in the form of statuary and opulent stucco work on the pediments above façades and windows, is Baroque. The exterior has remained as finished during the reign of [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]]. The principal façades, those facing the Palace Square and the Neva river, have always been accessible and visible to the public. Only the lateral façades are hidden behind [[granite]] walls, concealing a garden created during the reign of [[Nicholas II]].&lt;ref&gt;Budberg, p. 200.; states the gardens were created by Nicholas I; the Hermitage Museum's own website state these walled gardens were the creation of Alexandra Feodorovna, wife of Nicholas II.&lt;/ref&gt; The building was conceived as a town palace, rather than a private palace within a park, such as that of the French kings at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].

[[File:Nicholas Hall (rectified).jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Nicholas Hall (''6 on plan'') is the principal reception room, at the centre of the [[Neva Enfilade of the Winter Palace|Neva enfilade]]. This room was the setting for court balls. Painting by Konstantin Ukhtomsky&lt;ref name=Budberg201/&gt;]]
The architectural theme continues throughout the interior of the palace. The first floor, being the [[piano nobile]], is distinguished by windows taller than those of the floors above and below. Each window is divided from its neighbour by a [[pilaster]]. The repetitive monotony of the long elevations is broken only by symmetrically placed slightly projecting bays, many with their own small [[portico]]. This theme has been constant during all subsequent rebuilding and alterations to the palace. The only external changes have been in colour: at various times in its history the palace has been painted different shades. In the eighteenth century, the palace was painted straw yellow with white and gilded ornament.  Under Nicholas I in 1837, it was painted a dull red, which it remained through the revolution and early Soviet period. Following the restoration work after World War II, it was painted green with the ornament depicted in white, the standard Soviet color scheme for Baroque buildings. (The [[Stroganov Palace]], for example, was also green and white in this period.){{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Internally, the palace appears as a combination of the Baroque and the Neoclassical. Little of Rastrelli's rococo interior design has survived; only the Jordan Staircase and the Grand Church remain in their original style. The changes to the interior were largely due to the influences of the architects employed by Catherine the Great in the last years of her life, [[Ivan Starov|Starov]] and [[Giacomo Quarenghi|Quarenghi]], who began to alter much of the interior of the palace as designed by Rastrelli. Catherine always wanted the latest fashions, and during her reign the more severe [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architectural influences, fashionable in Western Europe from the late 1760s, slowly crept towards Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200" /&gt;  The neoclassical interiors were further emphasised and extended during the reign of Catherine's grandson, Nicholas I.

Quarenghi is credited with introducing the [[Neoclassical style]] to Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200" /&gt; His work, together with that of [[Karl Ivanovich Rossi]] and [[Auguste de Montferrand]], gradually transformed Saint Petersburg into an "Empire Town". Montferrand not only created some of the palace's greatest neoclassical interiors, but also was responsible for the erection of the [[Column of Alexander]] during the reign of Nicholas I in Rossi's newly designed [[Palace Square]].

For a long time the Winter Palace was the tallest edifice in the city. In 1844, Nicholas I gave the orders to the effect that private houses should be at least 1 sazhen (2.13 m) lower than the Winter Palace. This rule was effective until 1905.&lt;ref name="Winter Palace in St Petersburg Russia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stpetersburgrussia.ru/palaces/winter_palace|title=Winter Palace|publisher=StPetersburgRussia.ru|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interior===
[[File:Small Throne Room of the Winter Palace.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Small Throne Room ''(10 on plan)'' was created by [[Auguste de Montferrand]] in 1833. It has columns of [[jasper]]. Diplomats gathered here on New Year's Day to offer good wishes to the Emperor.&lt;ref name=Budberg201/&gt;]]
The Winter Palace is said to contain 1,500 rooms, 1,786 doors and 1,945 windows.&lt;ref&gt;Figures from King, page 169. These figures are widely quoted. However, while the figure of 1,783 windows is likely, a figure of 1,500 rooms would have to include windowless basement rooms, multiple servants rooms in the attics and closets etc. Compare the 2000 rooms in the [[Hofburg Palace|Vienna Hofburg]] and 1400 rooms of [[Schönbrunn Palace|Schönbrunn]], which is much smaller than the Winter Palace. Available plans given by the Hermitage Museum and the original 18th century plans do not show 1,057 rooms. Cowles, p88, claims the Winter Palace had 1,500 rooms, prior to the erection of the adjoining Hermitage.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal façade is {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p.200" /&gt; The ground floor contained mostly bureaucratic and domestic offices, while the second floor was given over to apartments for senior courtiers and high-ranking officials. The principal rooms and living quarters of the Imperial Family are on the first floor, the piano nobile.&lt;ref&gt;Images of many of the principal rooms can be obtained from the links beneath the plan&lt;/ref&gt; The great state rooms, used by the court, are arranged in two [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]]s, from the top of the Jordan Staircase. The original Baroque suite of the Tsaritsa Elizabeth running west, fronting the Neva, was completely redesigned in 1790–93 by Giacomo Quarenghi. He transformed the original enfilade of five state rooms into a suite of three vast halls, decorated with [[faux marble]] columns, [[bas-reliefs]] and statuary.&lt;ref name="Catherine II"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_7_7_1.html|title=Catherine II (1762–1796)|publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Division of WinterPalace.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Plan showing the use and division of the principal floor, as occupied in the 1840s. 1 (red): State and most formal rooms; 2 (dark green): Apartments of the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar]]; 3 (pink): Apartments of the [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Empress]]; 4: Apartments of the [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsarevich]], other times part of principal guest suite; 5: Apartments of the [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Tsarevna]]; 6: Apartments reserved for guests of the highest rank and members of the Imperial Family; 7: Nurseries of [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1831–1891)|the 3rd]] and [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia|the 4th]] in line to the throne; 8: General private rooms of the Imperial Family; 9: Principal guest suite, used immediately after their marriage by [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1819-1876)|Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna]] and [[Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg|her husband]]]]
A second suite of state rooms running south to the Great Church was created for Catherine II. Between 1787–95, Quarenghi added a new eastern wing to this suite which contained the great throne room, known as [[St George's Hall, and Apollo Hall of the Winter Palace|St George's Hall]] ''(13)'',&lt;ref name="Catherine II"/&gt; which linked the Winter Palace to Catherine's less formal palace, the Hermitage, next door. This suite was altered in the 1820s when the [[Military Gallery]] ''(11)'' was created from a series of small rooms, to celebrate the defeat of Napoleon. This gallery, which had been conceived by Alexander I, was designed by [[Carlo Rossi (architect)|Carlo Rossi]] and was built between June and November 1826 under Nicolas I; it was inaugurated on 25 October 1826.&lt;ref name="MobileReference"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saint Petersburg Sights: a travel guide to the top 50 attractions in St. Petersburg, Russia (Mobi Sights)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9nT8K1RucUC&amp;pg=PT84|accessdate=13 April 2011|publisher=MobileReference|isbn=978-1-60778-932-1|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the 1812 Gallery, the Tsar commissioned 332 portraits of the generals instrumental in the defeat of France. The artist was the Briton [[George Dawe]], who received assistance from [[Alexander Polyakov (artist)|Alexander Polyakov]] and [[Wilhelm August Golicke]].&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt;

Nicholas I was also responsible for the creation of the Battle Galleries ''(19)'', which occupy the central portion of the Palace Square façade. They were redesigned by [[Alexander Briullov]] to commemorate the Russian victories prior to 1812. Immediately adjacent to these galleries celebrating the French defeat, were rooms ''(18)'' where [[Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg]], Napoleon's step-grandson and the Tsar's son-in-law, lived during the early days of his marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The website of The State Hermitage Museum records the Duke living in these rooms, soon after his marriage to the [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1819-1876)|Tsar's daughter]], in 1839. The Tsar built the Duke and Duchess of Leuchtenberg the [[Marinsky Palace]] (completed in 1844), thus enabling the Duke to escape to what must have been less humiliating surroundings.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire of 1837===

{{Main|Fire in the Winter Palace}}
In 1833, de Montferrand was hired to redesign the eastern state rooms and create the Field Marshal's Hall and the Small Throne Room ''(9 &amp; 10)''. In 1837, a fire broke out. Its cause is unknown, but its spread is blamed on de Montferrand. The architect was being hurried by the Tsar for an early completion, so he used wooden materials where stone would have been better. Additionally, between the hurriedly built wooden partition walls disused fireplaces were concealed; their chimneys, coupled with the narrow ventilation shafts, acted as flues for the fire, allowing it to spread undetected between the walls from room to room until it was too late to extinguish.&lt;ref name="Norman, pp. 70–71"&gt;Norman, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Green HermitageFire.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Fire in the Winter Palace]]'' by Boris Green]]

Once detected, the fire continued to spread, but slowly enough that the palace guards and staff were able to rescue many of the contents, depositing them in the snow in Palace Square. This was no mean feat, as the treasures of the Winter Palace were always heavy furniture and fragile ornaments rather than lighter paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/valse/parttwo.html|title= Valse des fleurs|publisher=Sitwell, Sacheveral | accessdate=27 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To create a firebreak, the Tsar ordered the destruction of the three passages leading to the Hermitage, a fortunate act which saved the building and the huge art collection.&lt;ref name="Fire"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_4_2_1_2.html|title= The Fire of 1837 and Restoration of the Winter Palace |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian poet [[Vasily Zhukovsky]] witnessed the conflagration—"a vast bonfire with flames reaching the sky." The fire burned for several days, and destroyed most of the Winter Palace's interior.&lt;ref name="Norman, pp. 70–71" /&gt;

Seeming to ignore the size of the palace, the Tsar ordered that the rebuilding be completed within a year. The [[Marquis de Custine]] described the "unheard of efforts" that were necessary to facilitate this. "During the great frosts 6000 workmen were continually employed; of these a considerable number died daily, but the victims were instantly replaced by other champions brought forward to perish."&lt;ref&gt;de Custine, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was supervised by [[Pyotr Kleinmichel]], who had already gained a reputation for ruthlessness when serving in the [[military settlement]]s under [[Arakcheev]].&lt;ref name=Hayward&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayward|first=Richard Mowbray|title=Russia Enters the Railway Age, 1842-1855|year=1998|publisher=East European Monographs|location=Boulder|isbn=0-88033-390-1|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebuilding of the palace took advantage of the latest construction techniques of the industrial age. The roof was supported by a metal framework, while the spans of ceilings in the great halls were supported by iron girders.&lt;ref name="Fire"/&gt; Following the fire, the exterior, most of the principal state suites, the Jordan staircase and the Grand Church were restored to their original design and decoration by the architect [[Vasily Stasov]]. Some of the rooms, such as the second largest room in the Winter Palace, the Armorial Hall, became far more ornate, however, with a heavy use of [[gilding|gilt]].&lt;ref name="Fire"/&gt; The smaller and more private rooms of the palace were altered and decorated in various 19th-century contemporary styles by [[Alexander Briullov]] according to whims and fashion of their intended occupants, ranging from Gothic to rococo.&lt;ref name="Fire"/&gt; The Tsarevna's crimson boudoir ''(23)'', in the [[Private Apartments of the Winter Palace|private Imperial apartments]], was a faithful reproduction of the rococo style, which Catherine II and her architects started to eliminate from the palace less than 50 years earlier. One of the palace's most notable rooms was created as a result of the fire when the Jasper Room, which had been destroyed, was rebuilt as the [[Malachite Room of the Winter Palace|Malachite Drawing Room]], the principal reception room of the Tsaritsa's suite. The Tsar himself, for all the grandeur he created in his palaces, loved the greatest simplicity. His bedroom at the Winter Palace was spartan, with no ornaments save for some maps and an [[icon]], and he slept on a camp bed with a straw mattress.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage of the palace==
[[File:Amorial Hall.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Armorial Hall, or Guard Room, ''(11 on plan)'' is decorated with vast [[stucco]] [[panoply|panoplies]].]]

While the state rooms occupied the northern and eastern wings of the palace and the private rooms of the Imperial Family occupied the western wing, the four corners of the building contained the smaller rooms, which were the apartments of lesser members of the Imperial Family, often being of two floors. This is one of the reasons that the palace can appear a confusing assortment of great halls or salons with no obvious purpose located in odd corners of the palace. The fact that the Malachite Drawing Room is separated from the equally large Gold Drawing Room by a series of bedrooms and small cabinets initially seems unusual. However, when considered in the context that the Malachite Drawing Room was the principal reception room of the Empress' apartment while the Gold Drawing Room was the principal reception room of the apartment of her daughter-in-law, the [[Tsarevna]], the arrangement of the rooms makes more sense. Similarly the vast White Hall, so far from the other grand halls, was in fact the principal hall of the [[Tsarevich]]'s and Tsarevna's apartments. Thus the Winter Palace can be viewed as a series of small palaces within one large palace, with the largest and grandest rooms being public while the residents lived in suites of varying sizes, allocated according to rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/virtual-tour/hermitage.asp|title=The Winter Palace and museum|publisher=Saint-Petersburg.com|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the formal home of the Russian Tsars, the palace was the setting for profuse, frequent and lavish entertaining. The dining table could seat 1000 guests, while the state rooms could contain up to 10,000 people—all standing, as no chairs were provided.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to [[Queen Victoria]] from [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]]. Quoted: Maylunas, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; These rooms, halls and galleries were heated to such a temperature that while it was sub-zero outside, exotic plants bloomed within, while the brilliant lighting gave the ambiance of a summer's day.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GrandChurch.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Grand Church of the Winter Palace|The Winter Palace's Grand Church]] today retains its original rococo decoration. The [[onion dome]] above it is one of the few concessions to an older Russian architecture allowed to be visible from the exterior. Painting by [[Eduard Hau]]]]
Guests on ceremonial and state occasions would follow a set processional route, arriving at the palace courtyard through the central arch of the south façade, and then entering the palace through the state entrance (sometimes called the ambassadors' entrance) ''(38)''. They would then proceed through the [[colonnade]]d Jordan Hall before mounting the gilded [[Imperial staircase]] ''(8)'', from where the two enfilades of state rooms spread out. The principal or Jordan Staircase, so-called because on the Feast of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], the Tsar descended in state for the ceremony of the Blessing of the Waters, is one of the few parts of the palace to retain the original 18th century rococo style, although the massive grey granite columns were added in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="Budberg, p. 198" /&gt;

One of the most important rooms was the [[Grand Church of the Winter Palace|Palace's Grand Church]] ''(16)''. Granted cathedral status, it was of greater religious significance than the chapels of most European royal palaces. It was here that Romanov weddings were usually celebrated with a rigid and unchanging tradition and protocol. Even the bride's dress, and the manner of donning it, was dictated by tradition. Dressed by the Empress, the bride and her procession would pass from the Malachite Drawing Room to the church through the state rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]]. Quoted: Maylunas, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Family were not the only residents of the palace; below the metal framework in the attics lived an army of servants. So vast were the [[servants' quarters]] that a former servant and his family, unbeknownst to the palace authorities, moved into the roof of the palace. They were only discovered by the smell of the manure from the cow that they had also smuggled into the building with them to provide fresh milk.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems this cow was not the only bovine in the attics; other cows were kept next to the room occupied by the Maids of Honour, in order to provide fresh milk for the kitchens. This practice was discontinued after the 1837 fire.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial Hermitage Museum===
{{Main|State Hermitage Museum}}
[[File:New Hermitage.jpg|left|300px|thumb|The [[Atlas (architecture)|Atlantes]] portico to the extension of Catherine II's New Hermitage, Russia's first public art gallery.]]
After the death of Catherine the Great, the Hermitage had become a private treasure house of the Tsars, who continued collecting, albeit not on the scale of Catherine the Great. In 1850, the collection of [[Cristoforo Barbarigo]] was acquired. This collection from Venice brought into the Winter Palace further works by Titian, in addition to many 16th-century Renaissance works of art.

Nicholas I, conscious of the great art galleries in other European capitals, saw that Catherine the Great's Large Hermitage ''(15)'' was vastly expanded and transformed into a purpose-built public art gallery. In 1839, German architect [[Leo von Klenze]] drew up the plans and their execution was overseen by [[Vasily Stasov]], assisted by [[Alexander Briullov]] and [[Nikolai Yefimov]].&lt;ref name="Watkin2005"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Watkin|first=David|title=A history of Western architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39T1zElEBrQC&amp;pg=PA504|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=5 September 2005|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=978-1-85669-459-9|page=504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Persianova1979"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Persianova|first=Olʹga|title=The Hermitage: room-to-room guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B9UrAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=1979|publisher=Aurora Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; With so many architects involved there were inevitably many conflicts over the design and its execution throughout the 1840s, with the Tsar having frequently to act as moderator.&lt;ref name="Museum construction"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_9_2.html|title=Construction of the Public Museum |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, after eleven years of building and architectural conflict, the first art museum in Russia, the Imperial Hermitage Museum, opened on 5 February 1852.&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt; The trebeated facades of the building were inspired by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel|Schinkelesque architecture]]. It was erected in grey marble round three courtyards and the complex is noted for the asymmetrical planning of its wings and floors.&lt;ref name="Watkin2005"/&gt; By order of the Tsar, visitors to the museum were required to wear [[Formal wear|evening dress]], even in the morning. The Tsar also decreed that grey top hats were "Jewish" and dress coats "revolutionary."&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  Having negotiated the dress code, what the public saw was a huge array of art, but only a fraction of the Imperial collection, as the Winter Palace and other Imperial palaces remained closed to the viewing public.

==The last Tsars (1855–1905)==
[[File:Александр II.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] photographed in his study (24) at the Winter Palace]]
The Winter Palace was an official residence of the Russian sovereign from 1732 until 1917; however, it was their home for little more than 140 of those years. The last Tsar to truly reside in the palace was [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], who ruled from 1855 to 1881, when he was assassinated. During his reign there were more additions to the contents; acquisitions included the ancient and archaeological collection of the unfortunate [[Giampietro Campana|Marchese di Cavelli]] in 1861 and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s "Madonna and Child" in 1865; Leonardo's second work of that same name, the so-called "Benois Madonna", was later acquired in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1_30.html|title=1914: Purchase of Leonardo da Vinci's Madonna with a Flower (Benois Madonna)|publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander II was a constant target for assassination attempts, one of which occurred inside the Winter Palace itself. This attempt on the Tsar's life was organized by a group known as [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya (Will of the People)]] and led by an "unsmiling fanatic", [[Andrei Zhelyabov]], and his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] [[Sophia Perovskaya]], who later became his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Perovskaya, the daughter of a former Governor of Saint Petersburg, was well placed to learn information concerning happenings within the palace and through her connections learnt of repairs being carried out in the palace's basement.&lt;ref name="Cowles209" /&gt; One of the group, a trained carpenter, was subsequently enrolled as one of the workmen. Every day he carried dynamite charges concealed amongst his tools, placing them beneath the private dining room. So great was the quantity of dynamite that the fact there was an intervening floor between the dining room and the basement was of no significance.&lt;ref name=Cowles209&gt;Cowles, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Plans were made to detonate the bomb on the evening of {{OldStyleDate|17 February|1880|5 February}}, assassinating the Tsar and Imperial family as they dined. Fortunately for the Romanovs, a guest arriving from Berlin was delayed, and for the first time in years dinner was delayed.&lt;ref name=Cowles209/&gt; As the family left the drawing room for the dining room the bomb exploded. So great was the explosion that it could be heard all over Saint Petersburg. The dining room was completely demolished and 11 members of the [[Finnish Guard]] in the Guard Room below were killed and a further 30 wounded.&lt;ref name=Cowles209/&gt; The incident represents one of the first uses of a [[time bomb]] for political purposes. The ''New York Times'' (March 4, 1880) reported "the dynamite used was inclosed in an iron box, and exploded by a system of clockwork used by the man [[Alexander Keith, Jr.|Thomas]] in Bremen some years ago."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book|last=Larabee|first=Ann|title=The Dynamite Fiend: The Chilling Tale of a Confederate Spy, Con Artist, and Mass Murderer|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|date=2005|isbn=9781403967947}}, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, the revolutionaries were finally successful and Alexander II was assassinated as his carriage drove through the streets of Saint Petersburg. The Winter Palace was never truly inhabited again. The new Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] was informed by his security advisers that it was impossible to make the Winter Palace secure.&lt;ref name=Cowles216&gt;Cowles, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial Family then moved to the seclusion of the [[Palace of Gatchina]], some {{convert|40|mi|km}} from Saint Petersburg. By comparison with the Winter Palace, the 600 room, moated Gatchina Palace, set within forests, was a cosy family home.&lt;ref name=Cowles216/&gt; When in Saint Petersburg, the Imperial Family resided at the [[Anichkov Palace]], while the Winter Palace was used for official functions. Large economies were made in food and wine. The Tsar was highly interested in the running costs of the Palace, insisting that table linen was not to be changed daily, and that candles and soap were not replaced until completely spent. Even the number of eggs used in an omelette was reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Tsar economised on household expenses, he added to the Imperial art collection of both the palace and the Hermitage. Officially, the Hermitage Museum had an annual buying allowance of 5,000 rubles, but when this proved insufficient the Tsar would himself purchase items for the museum.&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt;

Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)]], the wife of Alexander III, saw that a garden was laid out in the centre of the main courtyard in 1885, an area previously cobbled and lacking vegetation. Court architect [[Nikolai Gornostayev]] designed a garden surrounded by a granite plinth and a fountain, and planted trees in the courtyard, laying limestone pavements along the walls of the palace.&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum Romanovs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_7_3.html|title= The Last Romanovs |publisher=State Hermitage Museum|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Alexander III was succeeded by his son [[Nicholas II]]. The last Tsar suspended court mourning for his father to marry his wife [[Alix of Hesse]] in a lavish ceremony at the Winter palace.&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the ceremony the newlywed couple retired to the Anichkov Palace, along with the Dowager Empress. There they began their married life in six small rooms.&lt;ref name="Massie1967,61"&gt;Massie 1967, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexandra Fjodorowna and Nicholas II of Russia in Russian dress.3.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Nicholas II and the Empress dressed as [[Alexis I]] and [[Maria Miloslavskaya]], for the Winter Palace's [[1903 Ball in the Winter Palace|last Imperial ball]]]]
In 1895, Nicholas and Alexandra established themselves at the [[Alexander Palace]] at [[Tsarskoe Selo]]. This was to be their favoured home for the remainder of the reign. However, from December 1895 they did reside for periods during the winter at the Winter Palace. Architect [[Alexander Krasovsky]] was commissioned to redecorate a suite of rooms in the north-west corner of the palace, including the Gothic library.&lt;ref name="VarshavskiĭRest1985"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Varshavskiĭ|first1=Sergeĭ Petrovich|last2=Rest|first2=B.|title=The ordeal of the Hermitage: the siege of Leningrad, 1941–1944|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WsWfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=1985|publisher=Aurora Art Publishers|isbn=978-0-8109-1406-3|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, the wife of Nicholas II was credited for the creation of another garden (35) on the former parade ground, beneath the windows of the Imperial Family's private apartments. She had found it disconcerting that the public could stare into her windows. The garden was created by [[landscape architect]] [[Georg Kuphaldt]], the director of the [[Riga]] city gardens and parks.&lt;ref name="kavere"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kāvere| first = Anne| title =Rīgas dārzu arhitekts Georgs Kūfalts.| language = Latvian| publisher=Jumava| location = Riga| pages = 107–108| year = 2007| oclc = 191090541| isbn = 978-9984-38-349-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is only one of [[Gardens of the Winter Palace|two gardens]] which remain today at the palace.

During the reign of Nicholas II, court life was quieter than it had ever been, due to the Tsaritsa's retiring nature and mistrust of Saint Petersburg's high society.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p247"&gt;Cowles, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Empress' opinion: "Saint Petersburg is a rotten town, and not one atom Russian."&lt;ref&gt;Radziwill, pp 158–59&lt;/ref&gt; Under her influence, gradually the great court receptions and balls at the Winter Palace, which humoured and cultivated the powerful nobility, came to an end. They were briefly replaced by theatricals held in the Hermitage which "no one enjoyed",&lt;ref name="Cowles, p247" /&gt; then even the theatricals ceased.&lt;ref name="Cowles, p247" /&gt;

The final great Imperial gathering at the Winter Palace was a themed fancy dress ball celebrating the reign of [[Alexis I of Russia|Alexei I]], which took place on 11 and 13 February 1903 ([[1903 Ball in the Winter Palace]]). Grand Duke [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Alexander Mikhailovich]] recalled the occasion as "the last spectacular ball in the history of the empire...[but] a new and hostile Russia glared through the large windows of the palace...while we danced, the workers were striking and the clouds in the Far East were hanging dangerously low."&lt;ref&gt;Maylunas, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire Imperial family, the Tsar as Alexei I, the Empress as [[Maria Miloslavskaya]], all dressed in rich 17th century attire, posed in the Hermitage's theatre, many wearing priceless original items brought specially from the [[Kremlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Maylunas, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; for what was to be their final photograph together.&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Russia was at [[Russo-Japanese War|war with Japan]], and the newborn [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich]] was secretly ill; the Tsar and the Empress permanently abandoned Saint Petersburg, the Winter Palace, and high society (considered by the Empress to be decadent and immoral&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;) for the greater comfort, security and privacy of Tsarskoe Selo. Thus it was that the Winter Palace, designed and intended to impress, reflect and reinforce the Romanovs' power, lost its [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] over a decade before the fall of the dynasty it was intended to house and glorify.

===Fall of the House of Romanov (1905–1918)===

[[File:Nicholas II of Russia painted by Earnest Lipgart.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Nicholas II, last Tsar of all the Russias, in the [[Nicholas Hall of the Winter Palace|Nicholas Hall]]. Portrait by [[Earnest Lipgart]], early 1900s.]]
Following the Imperial Family's move to the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo,&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; the Winter Palace became little more than an administrative office block and a place of rare official entertaining. Throughout the year, the family moved from one palace to another: in March, to [[Livadia Palace|Livadia]]; in May to [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] (not the great palace, but a 19th-century villa in its grounds); in June, they cruised upon the Imperial Yacht, [[Standart (yacht)|Standart]]; August was spent in Poland, at [[Spala]], September was spent back at Livadia, before a return to Tsarskoe Selo for the Winter.&lt;ref name=Massie1967,69&gt;Massie 1967, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tsar betrayed his private views of Saint Petersburg in 1912, while addressing a farewell party of dignitaries and family bidding him farewell, as the family left for warmer climes: "I am only sorry for you who have to remain in this bog."&lt;ref name=Massie1967,69/&gt; However, to the Tsar's ordinary subjects, the Winter Palace was seen not only as the home of the Tsars, but a symbol of Imperial power. In this role, it was to be at the centre of some of the most momentous happenings in Russia's early 20th century history. Three of these events stand out in Russia's history: The Bloody Sunday massacre of 1905; the opening of the first State Duma in 1906, which opened in St George's Hall (13); and finally the taking of the palace by revolutionaries in 1917.

The Bloody Sunday massacre was a result of the public ignorance of the Tsar's place of residence. It occurred on {{OldStyleDate|22 January|1905|9 January}} during a demonstration march by workers toward the Winter Palace.   The closest shootings of demonstrators occurred near St. Isaac's Cathedral at the entrance to the Aleksandr Gardens leading to the Palace Square in front of the Winter Palace. The massacre was sparked when a Russian Orthodox priest and popular working class leader, [[George Gapon|Father Gapon]], announced his intention to lead a peaceful protest of 100,000 unarmed striking workers to present a petition to the Tsar, to call for fundamental reforms and the founding of a constituent parliament.&lt;ref name=Kurth78&gt;Kurth, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters were unaware that the palace was little more than an uninhabited icon of Imperial power, and that the Tsar no longer resided there. The Tsar was not informed of the planned protest until the evening before, while no suggestion was made that the Tsar should meet a deputation or send representative to accept the petition.&lt;ref name=Kurth78/&gt; Instead, the Minister for the Interior drafted additional troops. As the strikers neared the palace bearing religious icons and singing the Imperial anthem, the Tsar's troops opened fire. While the number of casualties is disputed, moderate estimates average around 1,000 men, women and children killed or injured. The massacre, which came to be known as Bloody Sunday, was a serious blunder on the part of the [[Okhrana]] and was to have grave consequences for the Tsarist regime. It was also to be the catalyst for the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905 Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vorres, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Subsequently, little changed politically in Russia during this period, and the Winter Palace remained in darkness. In 1913 the Romanov dynasty celebrated its [[300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty|tercentenary]], but the crowds that flocked to see the processions were thin, the Empress appeared unhappy and the heir sick. The Tsar and Empress declined to hold a celebratory ball at the Winter Palace, instead holding two small receptions, both of which the Empress failed to attend.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Russia was forced to go to [[World War I|war]] as a result of the [[Triple Entente|Triple Entente Alliance]]. The Tsar and Empress briefly returned to the Winter Palace to stand on their balcony to accept salutes and homage from the departing troops. Ironically, unlike the monarchs of Europe who stood on balconies adorned with velvet, flanked by their families, the Tsar and Empress stood, alone, in one corner of an unadorned balcony, appearing almost lost next to an oversized Imperial emblem, soon to be torn down by their own subjects. As the departing troops saluted their monarch in front of the palace, plans were being drawn up to store the palace's contents and convert the state rooms into a hospital to receive returning troops.
[[File:Romanovs on Balcony.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In 1914, the Tsar and Empress bless their troops from the balcony of the Winter Palace.]]
In the initial stages of the war, Russia endured heavy losses at the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Masurian Lakes]] and [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] and it was to the Winter Palace that many of the wounded returned. Rechristened the Tsarevich Alexey Nikolayevich Hospital, from October 1915, the palace was a fully equipped hospital, its staterooms transformed into hospital wards. The Fieldmarshals' Hall became a dressing station, the Armorial Hall an operating theatre. The small throne room became a doctor's mess room, while more lowly staff were accommodated in the Nicholas Hall and the Anteroom. Nurses were housed in the more intimate apartments once reserved for members of the extended Romanov family. The 1812 Gallery became a store room, the vestibule of the Jordan staircase the hospital's canteen, and its landings offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1_31.html |title=1914: Start of World War I.

[[File:Winterpalace1914hosp.jpg|thumb|250px|left|1915, the Nicholas Hall, transformed to a hospital ward.]]
As the war went badly for Russia, its catastrophes were reflected in Saint Petersburg. The Tsar had decided to lead from the front, leaving the Empress to effectively rule Russia from Tsarskoe Selo. It was an unpopular move with both the Tsar's subjects and the Romanov family, as the Empress hired and fired indiscriminately often, it was supposed, on the advice of her favourite, [[Rasputin]]. Following Rasputin's murder by the Tsar's nephew-in-law in December 1916, the Empress' decisions and appointments became more erratic and the situation worsened and Saint Petersburg fell into the full grip of revolution.

Forced to accept the hopelessness of both the war and the situation at home, on 15 March 1917, Nicholas II abdicated in favour of his brother, [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Mikhail Alexandrovich]]. The Grand Duke promptly refused to accept the throne without the support of the army and his people. A [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional Government]] was appointed and many members of the former Imperial family were arrested, including the former Tsar, the Empress and their children. No member of the Romanov family have lived in the Winter Palace since the abdication in 1917 and very rarely did after 1905. Nicholas II, his wife and children were all held in captivity until they were murdered at [[Yekaterinburg]] in 1918. Other members of the former Imperial Family either met similar fates or escaped into exile.

==The Seat of the Provisional Government (1917)==
{{Main|Russian Revolution}}
[[File:Zimní palác (3).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rastrelli's Neva facade upon which ''[[Russian cruiser Aurora|Aurora]]'' trained her guns]]
It was this turbulent period of Russian history, known as the [[February Revolution]], which for a brief time saw the Winter Palace re-established as a seat of government and focal point of the former Russian Empire. In February 1917, the [[Russian Provisional Government]], led by [[Alexander Kerensky]], based itself in the north west corner of the palace with the [[Malachite Room of the Winter Palace|Malachite Room]] ''(4)'' being the chief council chamber. Most of the state rooms were, however, still occupied by the military hospital.

It was to be a short occupation of both palace and power. By 25 October 1917, the Provisional Government was failing and, realising the palace was a target for the more militant [[Bolshevik]]s, ordered its defence.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1917/dec/27/russia.fromthearchive |title=How the Bolsheviks took the Winter Palace|work=The Guardian |location=UK (eyewitness account of the storming of the Winter Palace)|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All military personnel in the city pledged support to the Bolsheviks, who accused Kerensky's Government of wishing to "surrender Petrograd to the Germans so as to enable them to exterminate the revolutionary garrison."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

Thus the provisional government, assisted by a few remaining loyal servants, who had formerly served the Tsar, barricaded themselves in the palace.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Many of the administrative staff fled, leaving the palace severely under-defended allegedly by some [[Cossack]]s, [[Cadet]]s, and 137 female soldiers from the [[Women's Battalion]]. Food ordered by the occupants of the palace was commandeered by the Bolsheviks, and, in a state of siege, the Winter Palace entered the most turbulent period in its history. According to Soviet history, five thousand sailors newly arrived from [[Kronstadt]] were deployed to attack the palace, while the cruiser ''[[Russian cruiser Aurora|Aurora]]''  positioned itself on the Neva, all its guns trained towards the Palace. Across the water, the Bolsheviks captured the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] and turned its [[artillery]] towards the besieged building. As the provisional Government, now impotent, hid in the private rooms of the former Imperial Family, nervously surveying the scenes outside,&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;  one by one the Government buildings in Palace Square surrendered to the Bolsheviks,&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; leaving the palace seemingly only hours from destruction.

At 7:00&amp;nbsp;pm, the Government held its last meeting in the Malachite Room, with the telephone and all contact with the outside world disconnected.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; A short debate determined that they would not leave the palace to attempt dialogue with the hostile crowds outside. With the palace completely surrounded and sealed, the Aurora began her bombardment of the great Neva façade as the Government refused an ultimatum to surrender. Further [[machine gun]] and light artillery fire were directed at the palace as the Bolsheviks gained entry via His Majesty's own Staircase ''(36)''. In the ensuing battle there were casualties on both sides until the Bolsheviks finally, by 2:00&amp;nbsp;am, had control of the palace. Leaving a trail of destruction, they searched room after room before arresting the Provisional Government in the [[Private Apartments of the Winter Palace|Small Dining Room]] of the private apartment ''(28)'', from where they were taken to imprisonment in the Fortress across the river. Kerensky managed to evade arrest and escape to [[Pskov]], where he rallied some loyal troops for an attempt to retake the capital. His troops managed to capture [[Tsarskoe Selo]], but were beaten the next day at [[Pulkovo Heights|Pulkovo]].

Following the Government's arrest, an alleged eye witness account by an unnamed source records that the Bolsheviks began rampaging:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "The Palace was pillaged and devastated from top to bottom by the Bolshevik[s]...Priceless pictures were ripped from their frames by bayonets. Packed boxes of rare plate and china...were broken open and the contents smashed or carried off. The library....was forced open and ransacked.....the Tsaritsa's salon, like all other rooms, was thrown into chaos. The colossal crystal lustre, with its artfully concealed music, was smashed to atoms. Desks, pictures, ornaments—everything was destroyed."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Winter Palace's wine cellars literally fuelled the weeks of looting and unrest in the city which followed. Arguably the largest and best stocked wine cellar in history,&lt;ref name="Figes1998"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Figes|first=Orlando|title=A people's tragedy: the Russian Revolution, 1891–1924|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSsGW-NqYVgC|accessdate=13 April 2011|date=March 1998|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-024364-2|page=494}}&lt;/ref&gt; it contained the world's finest vintages, including the Tsar's favourite, and priceless, [[Chateau de Calme|Chateau d’Yquem 1847]].&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orlandofiges.co.uk/aPeoplesTragedybyorlandofiges.php|author=Figes, Orlando|title=Storming the Palace|publisher=Cambridge University, PBS|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; So keen were the mob to obtain the alcohol, that the Bolsheviks explored radical solutions to the problem, one of which involved piping the wine straight out into the Neva. This led to crowds clustering around the palace drains. Another proposal, deemed too risky, was exploding the cellars. Eventually, the problem was solved by the declaration of martial law. It has been said that Petrograd, "perhaps with the biggest hangover in history, finally woke up and got back to some order."&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;

The Winter Palace was now a redundant and damaged building symbolic of a despised regime, facing an uncertain future. ''[[The Storming of the Winter Palace]]'' was a [[historical reenactment]] organised by the Bolsheviks on the 3rd anniversary in 1920. With thousands of Red Guards led by Lenin, and witnessed by 100,000 spectators, the reenactment has become one of the "best known" events of the Russian Revolution.

Ironically, the Red Guard actually broke into the palace through a back door that was left open, guarded by wounded and disabled reserves. This gave rise to the occasion being described as the birth of the Soviet state.&lt;ref&gt;Explorations in Saint Petersburg.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Podvoisky]], one of the original [[Troika (triumvirate)|troika]], which led the original storming, was so impressed by the re-enactment that he commissioned [[Sergei Eisenstein]] to make his film ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]''. Certain features, such as the banks of floodlights which appear in Eisenstein's film indicate that Eisenstein was more influenced by the re-enactment than the original event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft467nb2w4&amp;chunk.id=d0e44&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress Bolshevik Festivals, 1917–1920] by James Von Geldern accessed 5 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Richard.

On 30 October 1917, the palace was declared to be part of the Hermitage public museums. This first exhibition to be held in the Winter Palace concerned the history of the revolution, and the public were able to view the private rooms of the Imperial Family.&lt;ref name="The State Hermitage Museum" /&gt; This must have been an interesting experience for the viewing public, for while Soviet authorities denied looting and damage to the palace during the Storming, the Russian art connoisseur [[Alexander Alexandrovich Polovtsov, junior|Alexander Alexandrovich Polovtsov]], who visited these rooms immediately before and after the event, described the [[Private Apartments of the Winter Palace|private apartments]] as the most badly damaged area of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Faber, p158&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of the state rooms had been sent to Moscow for safety when the hospital was established, and the Hermitage Museum itself had not been damaged during the revolution.

Following the Revolution, there was a policy of removing all Imperial emblems from the palace, including those on the stonework, plaster-work and iron work.&lt;ref name="Brown1976"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Douglas|title=Doomsday 1917: the destruction of Russia's ruling class|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w90ZAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 April 2011|year=1976|publisher=Putnam|isbn=978-0-399-11615-5|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Soviet era, many of the palace's remaining treasures were dispersed around the museums and galleries of the Soviet Union. Some were sold for hard currency while others were given away to visiting dignitaries. As the original contents disappeared and other items from sequestered collections began to be displayed in the palace, the distinctions between the rooms' original and later use have become blurred. While some rooms have retained their original names, and some even the trappings of Imperial Russia, such as the furnishings of the Small and Large Throne Rooms, many other rooms are known by the names of their new contents, such as The Room of German Art.

Following the 1941–1944 [[Siege of Leningrad]], when the palace was damaged, a restoration policy was enacted, which has fully restored the palace.&lt;ref name=Budberg201/&gt; Furthermore, as the Russian Government does not categorically shun remnants of the Imperial Era as was the case during Soviet rule, the palace has since had the emblems of the Romanovs restored. The gilded and crowned double headed eagles once more adorn the walls, balconies and gates. The Winter Palace is no longer the hub of a great empire, and the Romanovs no longer reside there, but the crowned Russian eagle serves as a reminder of the palace's Imperial history.

Today, as part of one of the world's best known museums, the palace attracts an annual 3.5&amp;nbsp;million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stpetersburg2003.ch/about/index.php?lang=eng&amp;|title=St Petersburg: Swiss Architecture on the Neva (Domenico Trezzini 1727)|publisher=Presence Switzerland, Berne, Switzerland|accessdate=11 November 2008|page=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150025/http://www.stpetersburg2003.ch/about/index.php?lang=eng&amp;|archive-date=16 December 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
